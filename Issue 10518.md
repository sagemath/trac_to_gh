And Singular via pexpect (libsingular worked already):

There's some crap surrounding the log, but this is already a big step up. Note that the update is also live. If we want we can write filter for Singular and Magma such that only the wanted lines are actually printed, but I think this should be left for another ticket. The attached patch also implements this:


```python
sage: from sage.interfaces.expect import StdOutContext
sage: with StdOutContext(gp):
....:     gp('1+1')
....:     
sage=vector(1024,k,0);
sage=vector(1024,k,0);
? sage[1]=1+1;
sage[1]=1+1;
? print(sage[1])
print(sage[1])
2
? 2
```


which might be useful on its own.

The updated patch provides the following functionality:

**Pretty printing for Singular logs**


```python
sage: P.<x,y> = GF(32003)[]
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Katsura(P)
sage: _ = I.groebner_basis('magma', prot="sage")
_ = I.groebner_basis('singular', prot="sage")
Leading term degree:  1.
Leading term degree:  2.

Highest degree reached during computation:  2.
```


**And degree bounds for Magma:**


```python
sage: P.<x,y,z,a,b,c,w> = GF(32003)[]
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: gbM = I.groebner_basis('magma', deg_bound=3)
sage: gbM

wjp helped test this for magma and because of output changes, some doctests fail.  Since that's beyond our control to some extent I am not too worried about it.

I tested everything in sage/rings and all standard doctests passed.

This is very helpful for exploring what algorithm to use, excellent addition.
