# Issue 16337: ZZ[x]/<f>

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16574

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2014-06-27 23:49:51

Keywords: sd59

This ticket implements a dedicated class for doing computations in ZZ[x]/<f>.

The advantage over the previous generic implementation isn't mainly performance (both use FLINT anyway), but some added convenient functions, which can be expaned on in the future.

This ticket also cleans up a bit of FLINT stuff due to its history.

Some patchbot plugins failed. Are these legitimate errors? Or are my patchbot broken (again)?

```
sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_integer.random_element:14: WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```


looks like my fault, but


```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 790, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._eval_line
Failed example:
    singular.interrupt(timeout=3)  # sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```


looks unrelated.

I just rebuilt the docs and didn't get an error, maybe patchbot used an older check in?

This is some typical noise my patchbot creates. No clue why.

Ok. I'll have it retry. You can see which commit it used on the patchbot page; in this case it used cf0edb89c128854bc7ca7e2718d7d770e96ce0cd which seems to be the right one.
