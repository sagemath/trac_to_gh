This ticket implements a dedicated class for doing computations in ZZ[x]/<f>.

The advantage over the previous generic implementation isn't mainly performance (both use FLINT anyway), but some added convenient functions, which can be expaned on in the future.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16574

sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_integer.random_element:14: WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```


looks like my fault, but


```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 790, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._eval_line
Failed example:
    singular.interrupt(timeout=3)  # sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```


looks unrelated.
