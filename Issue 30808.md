From #30913:

Currently, `pip`, `wheel`, and `setuptools` are installed without making wheels available in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`.

In this ticket, we make wheels (or at least sdists) available in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS`.

This is so that PEP 517 packages such as `pplpy` can be installed themselves even when we don't allow use of PyPI.
