The doctest of `add_linear_constraint_vector` from generic_backend.pyx (which is never run for any real backend!), when applied to COIN or GLPK leads to segfaults:

```
sage:             sage: coeffs = ([0, vector([1, 2])], [1, vector([2, 3])])
sage:             sage: upper = vector([5, 5])
sage:             sage: lower = vector([0, 0])
sage:             sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage:             sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")                         # optional - cbc
sage: p.add_linear_constraint_vector(2, coeffs, lower, upper, 'foo')
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x0000000109df05c5 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault: 11

with the second example I only get segfault with Coin - with other backends I get gracefully handled errors.

Sorry! I tested the wrong file after making this change, so I did not catch this test failure.

Yes, the idea is to make `generic_backend.pyx` suitable for cut and paste again. 
But don't worry, I won't make many more tickets like this one;  I have been making progress with #20323.

You are right. I have now brought it in line with the doctests for the other methods. Same also for `add_linear_constraint`.
