The doctest of `add_linear_constraint_vector` from generic_backend.pyx (which is never run for any real backend!), when applied to COIN or GLPK leads to segfaults:

```
sage:             sage: coeffs = ([0, vector([1, 2])], [1, vector([2, 3])])
sage:             sage: upper = vector([5, 5])
sage:             sage: lower = vector([0, 0])
sage:             sage: from sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend import get_solver
sage:             sage: p = get_solver(solver = "Coin")                         # optional - cbc
sage: p.add_linear_constraint_vector(2, coeffs, lower, upper, 'foo')
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x0000000109df05c5 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

Segmentation fault: 11

with the second example I only get segfault with Coin - with other backends I get gracefully handled errors.
(on a branch with lots of recent positively reviewed LP-related tickets)

The COIN segfaults are addressed in #20360.

`solver.add_variables(2)` throws a `NotImplementedError` immediately, what's the point of the last commit then?


```
sage -t src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx", line 402, in sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.GenericBackend.add_linear_constraint_vector
Failed example:
    solver.add_variables(2)
...
    NotImplementedError
```

if you want to keep these as a template you'd mark them `# not tested `

Sorry! I tested the wrong file after making this change, so I did not catch this test failure.

Yes, the idea is to make `generic_backend.pyx` suitable for cut and paste again. 
But don't worry, I won't make many more tickets like this one;  I have been making progress with #20323.

Isn't it more in line with the rest of the code to tag these statements by ` # optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver` ? Then you don't need to insert Tracebacks...

Replying to [comment:9 dimpase]:
> Isn't it more in line with the rest of the code to tag these statements by ` # optional - Nonexistent_LP_solver` ? Then you don't need to insert Tracebacks...

You are right. I have now brought it in line with the doctests for the other methods. Same also for `add_linear_constraint`.

OK, good!
