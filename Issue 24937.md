CC:  @rwst

Keywords: FriCAS

The imaginary unit (as a symbolic expression) in FriCAS is "%i", not "I":

```
sage: fricas(I)^2
 2
I
sage: fricas("%i")^2
- 1
```

However, I was unable to find out where to change that.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25174

Fricas is accessed through an interface, see `sage/interfaces/fricas.py`. Converting a Sage object to an interface object is done by implementing a `_interface_` member function for the object. Note however that `I` is not a `Constant` object but a number field element (embedded in a symbolic expression, try `type(I.pyobject())`).

Since `_fricas_init_` is the **exact** same as `_maxima_init_` you should rather create a unique method for both of them (and add aliases).

As I mentioned in [comment:5] the test `a**2 == -1` is not enough. You should also consider the embedding. There is an attribute `standard_embedding` so that the test could become

```
if a**2 == -1 and a.standard_embedding:

You should also add a doctest for the case when the embedding is the non standard one.

How do I implement the distinction `NumberFieldElement_absolute._fricas_init_(self, I)` vs. `NumberFieldElement_absolute._maxima_init_(self, I)`.  Some `super` magic?

You mean `self.standard_embedding`. right?  Doing so, I get


```
sage: K.<J> = QuadraticField(-1, embedding=CC(0,-1))
sage: maxima(J)
...
TypeError: _maxima_init_() takes no arguments (1 given)
```


which is probably suboptimal.

I don't get it.  We have:


```
class A:
    def f(self): return superclass.f()
    def g(self): return superclass.g()
```


Is this really the same as 

```
class A:
    def f(self): return superclass.f()
    g = f
```

?
