Behold:


```
sage: p = Poset()
sage: p==Poset(p,category=p.category())
False
```


That's because it is basically forbidden to have "None" values for boolean arguments in `FinitePoset` when they are used by the `UniqueRepresentation` sh-- infrastructure.

This is because the category used when the first poset is created (i.e. which is used by `UniqueRepresentation`) does not contains `Sets().Facade()`, while it does for the second poset.

```

Here's a better fix which standardizes the category and it also handles this:

```
sage: P = Poset()
sage: Poset(P, category=P.category(), facade=False).category()
Join of Category of finite posets and Category of finite enumerated sets and Category of facade sets
```

and now returns:

```
Join of Category of finite posets and Category of finite enumerated sets
```
