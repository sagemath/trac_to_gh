Assignee: jason, was

The other pairs of methods (swap_rows/swap_columns, add_multiple_of_row/add_multiple_of_column, row_space/column_space, etc) all use the unabbreviated nouns, so I suggest renaming rescale_col to rescale_column for coherence.

I would provide a brutal patch (sed-magic), but it would certainly be worthy to add a rescale_col method which calls rescale_column and warns about the renaming before pulling the plug on the old method name -- and I don't know how to do that.
