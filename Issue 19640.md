Is the `notebook` patch included in the latest `notebook` upgrade? If yes, it should be removed. If no, then this branch here should bump the version to force a re-install of `notebook`.

I've installed the package atop sage 7.3.beta2 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with

```
git pull trac u/vbraun/add_sagenb_exporter__jupyter_extension
make
```

Everything seemed OK, but when I run

```
./sage --notebook=export --list
```

I get the error message

```
[C 14:58:52.386 NotebookApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[C 14:58:52.386 NotebookApp] Unrecognized flag: '--list'
```

Maybe unrelated, but running the command without the flad `--list` (i.e. just `./sage --notebook=export`) yields

```

Same issue after the install in a fresh 7.3.beta3 on Ubuntu 15.10.

Hi Volker,

I just gave it a shot with Min. Thanks for your work on this!

I have been using a lot the live documentation, and apparently this left out a whole lot of fake notebooks:

```
nthiery@mistral:~$ sagenb-export --list
Unique ID       | Notebook Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_sage_:0        | doc_browser_0
_sage_:1        | doc_browser_0
_sage_:2        | doc_browser_0
...
```


What about having sagenb-export ignore all notebooks owned by the user Sage?


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2016-06-29 21:33:24

After blasting away my `_sage_` notebooks:

This is presumably coming from a worksheet of mine whose name includes an accent. Most likely this is an utf-8 accent. I can investigate further if useful.

Cheers,

Comment by nthiery created at 2016-06-29 21:35:02

That was trivial in fact. I'll do a pull request shortly.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2016-06-29 22:10:10

I converted a couple of my worksheets, some being quite non trivial (all sorts of formatting, maths, links, ...), and overall this looks very promising!

Note for Eric: I installed with:

```
    git clone git@github.com:vbraun/ExportSageNB.git
    cd ExportSageNB
    sage -python install setup.py
```

And used with

```
    sage -sh
    sagenb-export ...
```

and that worked fine (modulo the PR by Min an myself)


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2016-06-29 22:18:15

Minor point: in some of the worksheets, the outputs appear litteraly as:

```
<html><span class="math">\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}2</span></html>
```



---

Comment by nthiery created at 2016-06-29 22:20:36

Feature requests:

```
    sagenb-export --ipynb admin:13
```

which chooses the out file name based on the worksheet title.


```
    sagenb-export --ipynb --all
```

Exports all notebooks, using the  worksheet titles as file names, using something like `bla.ipynb`, `bla-2.ipynb`, ... in case of name conflict.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2016-06-30 01:40:05

Thanks for trying this out, Nicolas!  You are motivating me to do so this week too.  Question before I start: did this still keep all the notebooks from sagenb in the same state?  (That is, can you still use sage -n with the "original" notebook and nothing has changed?)

PS I'd love that extra PR to use so I don't have to worry about any weird characters.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2016-06-30 22:55:42

The one-line install would be

```
sage -pip install git+https://github.com/vbraun/ExportSageNB.git
```

I think this is this note in the readme?
> SageNB html input cells are converted to Jupyter raw NBConvert cells; In the interactive Jupyter notebook these are not rendered as html but shown as their html source code. If you export to HTML (File -> Download as -> HTML) they are rendered as html, though.

I see now that this is already in upstream, so I'll try it out today.

I have exactly the same problem on Mac OS X 10.11, Sage 7.3.beta5.  Any ideas?

I'll also note that, if this is indeed the syntax (the github site indicates something different but I'm not sure how to invoke it here) it should be added to `sage -advanced`:

```
Running the notebook:
  --notebook=[...]    -- start the Sage notebook (valid options are
                         'default', 'sagenb', and 'jupyter'). See the output
                         of sage --notebook --help for more details and
                         examples of how to pass optional arguments
  -bn, -build-and-notebook [...] -- build the Sage library then start
                         the Sage notebook
  -inotebook [...]    -- start the *insecure* Sage notebook (deprecated)
  -n, -notebook [...] -- start the default Sage notebook (options are the
                         same as for the notebook command in Sage).  See the
                         output of sage -n -h for more details

```

There _is_ something minimal in `sage -n -h`, though, where I note the syntax is claimed to be `sage --notebook option` not `sage --notebook=option`.  I am reluctant to run any of these lest I destroy my notebooks...

> And used with

Got it.  However, there should be something that works straight from `sage -n`, so my feeling is "needs work".

Comment by kcrisman created at 2016-07-01 14:24:18

Question to vbraun: is it possible to save the notebook (with some syntax, perhaps) in a different location than the cwd?  Or should one navigate to the location you want to save them first, and then export?  I haven't used Jupyter much but I guess you can save notebooks wherever you want, right?


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2016-07-01 19:51:36

Here's another weird thing.  Listing works fine (thanks to Nicolas and Min's work, presumably), but this doesn't:

```
$ sagenb-export --list > list.txt
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
  File "/Users/.../sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb_export/actions.py", line 9, in tr
    print(u'{0:<15} | {1}'.format(unique_id, name))
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\u2019' in position 33: ordinal not in range(128)
```

I'm not sure why this would differ.

You can specify any path `sage --notebook=export --ipynb=/path/to/Output.ipynb admin:10`

Yes, the old sagenb notebooks are only read and never written to.

Thats SageNB works, "typeset" output is just plain text output that happens to start with `<html>`, the SageNB format does not have distinguished output types.

I've pulled the latest commit and compiled it (by make). There is no error in the build, but both 

```
./sage --notebook=export --list
```

and

```
./sage -sh
sagenb-export --list
```

result in the same error:

Indeed `./sage --notebook=export --list` works now. Thanks! 
I will test the export on my notebooks and will report here.


---

Comment by egourgoulhon created at 2016-07-04 19:45:18

I've tested the export on various notebooks (some of them quite long and rich in text). It works very well. Thank you very much for this very desired tool! I've only two minor comments:
- the displayed mathematical formulas typed between \[ and \] in text cells of sws notebooks
  are not properly rendered in the corresponding Markdown cells of jupyter notebooks: 
  the delimiters \[ and \] are interpreted as ordinary brackets and not as LaTeX markers; 
  they have to be replaced manually by $$ for the displayed math to appear correctly.
- for sws notebooks with the "Typeset" button turned on, it would be nice to have the jupyter
  notebook start by a code cell with 
  {{{
  %display latex
  }}}
  so that all outputs are actually typeset, as requested in the original notebook.

Ok. No big deal, since anyway it's just about the output which can be regenerated. Still it could be an easy addition in case we could easily circumvent the lack of metadata. Would it be simple and reasonably robust to check whether the output text starts with <html>?


---

Comment by kcrisman created at 2016-07-08 01:38:25

Various comments.   Some are specific to this and others probably are more about whether Jupyter should be default without some work.  I appreciate any comments more experienced Jupyter folks can make.

In general I think this branch is a good tool for those intent upon converting (perhaps except the `DATA` issue).  The fairly different nature of the Jupyter notebook (among other things) will note necessarily make it optimal to just convert all worksheets for many people (as opposed to new users who may wish to learn the different interaction from the start), though.

----
Most important:  When one has a notebook that had data, one gets

```
NameError: name 'DATA' is not defined
```

I have no idea how to fix this, or if Jupyter even supports something like a data folder.
----
Help link is good, but unfortunately it doesn't have a local copy of some of the help files (e.g., the "Notebook help" gives [this link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/3.x/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb)).  Since a lot of people (presumably still) occasionally need offline notebooks, that is unfortunate.
----
> for sws notebooks with the "Typeset" button turned on, it would be nice to have the jupyter notebook start by a code cell with `%display latex` so that all outputs are actually typeset, as requested in the original notebook.

Or even that html output would be recognized as such... that's probably too much to ask and sed through.


----
No `%auto` - just mentioning, not a killer.

----

Is there a way to close a notebook without turning off the server?  I didn't see something under "File".
----
Doing a basic interact:

```
NameError: name 'slider' is not defined
```

----
I can't figure out how to do interacts at all, in fact.  Even 

```
@interact
def _(n=3):
    print n^2
```

gives just some html, which I guess makes sense since that is what it does in sagenb.

----

Silly but necessary requests:

```
./sage -h
```

still gives 

```
  --notebook=[...]    -- start the Sage notebook (valid options are
                         'default', 'sagenb', and 'jupyter')
```


```
 ./sage -n -h
```

could use an example syntax and where to look for full syntax for `export`

----
When I make this change

```
%display latex
for n in range(1,20):
    (n,sigma(n,2))
```

it doesn't typeset.  Not sure if this is just different.

There is "Close and halt" as the last item of the "File" menu (under sage 7.3.beta6).

Even without `%display latex`, there is no output. To have some output in the notebook, one has to type

```
for n in range(1,20):
    print((n,sigma(n,2)))
```

to get text output, and

```
for n in range(1,20):
    show((n,sigma(n,2)))
```

to get displayed output. Note that one can replace `show` by `pretty_print`.

Yes, I used that, but what does "halt" mean?  I thought that meant something more drastic than it does...

Okay, that means the behavior here is different than in sagenb (or at least in some version of sagenb).

"halt" simply means "halt the kernel", not the server. I agree this is not very explicit...

Yes indeed.

Okay, after thinking about it, here is my list of "needs work".  Some may disagree, open to various outcomes.

This really breaks some worksheets that depend on it, so there should be some way to bring the data along for the ride.

But unfortunately it still means they don't work.  I thought someone had implemented this with Jupyter?  Maybe I am remembering something else unrelated.  Anyway (in my view) it sort of defeats the purpose of exporting if there isn't anything equivalent to export to.

Jupyter notebooks are a single file and not an opaque directory full of stuff. This is a fundamental design choice and not going to change. About the only thing we can do is prevent people from writing new SageNB notebooks so their data doesn't end up in an evolutionary dead end.

Jupyter interacts have a slightly different syntax

```
from ipywidgets import interact, IntSlider 
@interact
def _(n=IntSlider(3)):
    print n^2
```

One might write a compatibility layer so that the old SageNB interact syntax still works, thats not something that belongs on this ticket.

IMHO, it would be nice if the SageNB exporter is shipped with Sage 7.3. It will be useful to many users. The missing features could be postponed to another ticket, except maybe the documentation one (i.e. the `export` option should appear in the output of `./sage -h`). Accordingly, I would suggest to set the ticket to positive review. Do you agree?

(+1 for having it in the next release. however I did not participate in any way to the review)

So in a Jupyter notebook one would include other data in a more 'Pythonic' way?  We'd want fairly good documentation on how to do that (as well as the below).

I see.  That's too bad that it's not in the global namespace for Sage Jupyter worksheets, perhaps could be addressed there.  Making interacts more difficult to do is a regression (completely irrespective of the whole default or exporting question).  As a different question, would Jupyter notebooks be able to support the "extended" syntax that SMC and Sage cell support (e.g. nested interacts)?

I think I'm okay with that as long as it's not (yet) the default notebook for continuing users.  We need a solution of some kind for the above two issues before that.  Please cc: me on any such tickets - once created I think we can set this to positive review, yes.
