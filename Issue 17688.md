# Issue 17688: Warnings when compiling sage: function declaration isn't a prototype

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17925

Original creator: Snark

When compiling sage, there is a number of places where functions are declared with an empty argument list ; I have a patch which adds the correct argument list (explicit void, or the actual arguments).

This makes quite a few warnings disappear here.
