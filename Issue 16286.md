# Issue 16286: Relative vector spaces for function fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16523

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2014-06-24 06:58:04

Keywords: sd59

Currently, function fields have a method `vector_space` which represents the field as finite dimensional vector space over its base field.
This ticket adds functionality for towers of function fields so that a field can be represented as a vector space over an intermediate field.
