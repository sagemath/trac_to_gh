Daniel, thanks for looking at this.  It looks pretty good, and don't worry about the mixed messages from the patchbot you mentioned on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/8499ccf849b7833a/2c3678a00cd47447?show_docid=2c3678a00cd47447&pli=1) - the only failure was 

```
RuntimeError: Unexpected EOF from Gap executing UnorderedTuples([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],1);
```

in the symbolic ring code, and that was on 4.8, not 5.0.beta3.  If you think the code is right, isn't making some new assumption that would lead to a bug, is properly doctested, and passes tests, you should be good to give it positive review.

On my machine with 4.8, I cannot produce that error...

Yes, form my point of view it is a positive review.
