# Issue 20148: Update GMP-ECM to version 7.0

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: zimmerma

CC:  fbissey

GMP-ECM 7.0 is available at `https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/file/35642/ecm-7.0.tar.gz`.

Some issues were reported for the Debian package:
`https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=gmp-ecm`, in particular on 32-bit PowerPC and FreeBSD. Is there any such machine on the Sage build farm?

Changing component from elliptic curves to packages: standard.

I fail to see failures there by now (the version listed there also is 7.0.3+ds-1 though).

And no, AFAICT we don't have any PowerPC (neither 32-bit nor 64-bit) nor any FreeBSD _buildbot_.


I guess François regularly tests on Linux PowerPC64 though, and I think Jeroen still has access to some PowerPC running MacOS X 10.5 (we might no longer support; AFAIK 32-bit OS, not sure, but 64-bit CPU).

"Upgraded" to version 7.0.3 (of July 4th, currently the latest available).

(Strange that this version and 7.0.2 apparently haven't been tagged in the svn repo.)

According to [comment:ticket:19233:16 Paul's comment], we can drop the only patch (from #19233) we currently have in Sage.

Should we repackage the tarball with `bzip2`?

Note that the patch is preliminary (cf. the commit message / ticket description), but I'm setting it to "needs review" as there's something that can already be tested.

This is still true for 7.0.3 (and Ubuntu's GCC 4.6.3 at least), while what used to be `make check` is now `make longcheck`:

I think we should do `make check && make longcheck` in `spkg-check` then.

Ooops, on the other hand `make check` now *fails* with `-march=native -mno-xop -O3 -g` (while it passed without `-mno-xop`?!?!):

Hmmm, or maybe not, and `make clean` was just not enough.

After `make distclean`, `make check` again passes with `-march=native -mtune=native -mno-xop -O3 -g` in `gmp.h` (but now also `--enable-assert`).

But in `make longcheck`, I'm now getting a different, apparently unrelated error:

It seems `make longcheck` needs some upstream work, as I'm also getting (ignored!) "meta-errors" (syntax errors etc.) with a clean, fresh build on another (non-AMD) machine.

Apparently also building out-of-tree is broken (more precisely, running `make longcheck` in an out-of-tree build, which definitely fails).

Looks like I wasn't on cc even so Paul explicitly added me when the ticket was created. I missed all your action from the last few hours.
My gentoo ebuild passes "make check" but then I don't do fancy flags. Will try "make longcheck". 
Before the release Paul opened a conversation on the last ecm upgrade ticket. Apart from the doctest there is interface change to deal with [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14151#comment:46](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14151#comment:46)

Hmmm, perhaps recheck your trac notification preferences as you already commented on this ticket, too (so you should by default receive notifications even when not explicitly cc'ed).

And although I participated in that old ticket, I somehow missed all that discussion from a couple of months ago...

I have to admit I totally forgot Sage's pexpect interface to `ecm`.

Is the execstack issue meanwhile resolved upstream?

Should we add `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` in `spkg-install` until that's fixed upstream?

Yes. Upstream is open to a patch. Problem is the files are generated so you have to carefully fix the generator :(

Still no notification, I'll have to inspect the spam filter tomorrow but I suspect it is not even making it there. May have to change the email address for my notification. And go to the dashboard to see if I missed updates on other tickets.

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-03 09:40:11

So after N attempts, I finally built GMP-ECM _in-place_ two times (separate folders) on a Bulldozer (Opteron 6276), once with `-march=native -mtune=native -O3 -g`, and once with `-march=native -mtune=native -mno-xop -O3 -g`.

In *both* cases, `make check` and `make longcheck` succeeded now.

(This presumably means the relevant code in GMP-ECM 6.x has changed enough to no longer expose the bugs in GCC when mixing XOP and AVX instructions at higher optimization levels.  That's not too surprising, as even minor changes made the issue vanish when I tried (hard!) to create a testcase for bugzilla.)

?  `LDFLAGS`?  Perhaps `CCASFLAGS`?

Actually, upstream should add a `configure` check and add the appropriate flags when supported.

Do we have to care about anything but Linux (x86/x86_64/ppc/ppc64/SPARC...)?

Anything but GNU ld?  (Yes, on Solaris, the Sun linker may get used, but Solaris' not Linux.)


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-03 10:01:00

`LDFLAGS`, linux x86(_64) only I think. As for `ld` I still suffer AIX boxes on ppc64 but sage won't build over there anyway (building python packages need hand holding for starter).

GMP (6.1.1) has this:

```sh
dnl Checks whether the stack can be marked nonexecutable by passing an option
dnl to the C-compiler when acting on .s files. Appends that option to ASMFLAGS.
dnl This macro is adapted from one found in GLIBC-2.3.5.
dnl FIXME: This test looks broken. It tests that a file with .note.GNU-stack...
dnl can be compiled/assembled with -Wa,--noexecstack.  It does not determine
dnl if that command-line option has any effect on general asm code.
AC_DEFUN([CL_AS_NOEXECSTACK],[
dnl AC_REQUIRE([AC_PROG_CC]) GMP uses something else
AC_CACHE_CHECK([whether assembler supports --noexecstack option],
cl_cv_as_noexecstack, [dnl
  cat > conftest.c <<EOF

EOF
  if AC_TRY_COMMAND([${CC} $CFLAGS $CPPFLAGS
                     -S -o conftest.s conftest.c >/dev/null]) \
     && grep .note.GNU-stack conftest.s >/dev/null \
     && AC_TRY_COMMAND([${CC} $CFLAGS $CPPFLAGS -Wa,--noexecstack
                       -c -o conftest.o conftest.s >/dev/null])
  then
    cl_cv_as_noexecstack=yes
  else
    cl_cv_as_noexecstack=no
  fi
  rm -f conftest*])
  if test "$cl_cv_as_noexecstack" = yes; then
    ASMFLAGS="$ASMFLAGS -Wa,--noexecstack"
  fi
  AC_SUBST(ASMFLAGS)
])
```

Note that `--noexecstack` gets eventually passed to the _assembler_, not `-z noexecstack` to the _linker_.

Ha, when I was looking at 7.0rc with Paul I only had gmp-6.1.0 and I still had a message about the executable stack from portage if I didn't add `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` to `LDFLAGS`. I moved to 6.1.1 on 21st of June. And indeed I don't need to add it anymore, it is added automatically:

I was just about to note that GMP-ECM consistently uses `CCAS` (which defaults to `CC`) and `CCASFLAGS` (which default to `CFLAGS`)...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-03 10:46:10

In any case sage's default is `mpir` so we should pass it in the default case. Passing it with gmp-6.1.1 doesn't really hurt.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-03 10:46:52

Oh, GMP-ECM just harcodes it into `Makefile.am`:


```
libecm_la_LDFLAGS = $(LIBECM_LDFLAGS) -version-info 1:0:0 -g -Wl,-znoexecstack
```


(Executables are _not_ linked with that option, but link to the above library, and presumably don't contain any other asm modules.)

And some linkers require a space IIRC...

Well, until some linker bails out on that flag...  Or is libtool smart enough to remove it in case it isn't supported?

Point. Most linkers discard unrecognised option without side effect, the problem is when it can be interpreted in a completely different way by the linker (yes I have a "funny" example of that - it involves AIX's linker). It would be better if the flag was tested for in configure.

What's weird is that despite

```
  --enable-shared[=PKGS]  build shared libraries [default=no]
  --enable-static[=PKGS]  build static libraries [default=yes]
```

*and*

```
...
checking whether the gcc-6.1 linker (ld -m elf_x86_64) supports shared libraries... yes
checking dynamic linker characteristics... GNU/Linux ld.so
checking how to hardcode library paths into programs... immediate
checking whether stripping libraries is possible... yes
checking if libtool supports shared libraries... yes
checking whether to build shared libraries... no
checking whether to build static libraries... yes
...
```

still a _shared_ library gets built.

Ok, at least within Sage, only a static library gets _installed_.

I personally don't think it is a good idea. Yes that's supposed to be better performance but if your going to mix it python module it will probably have to be compiled with `pic` which will remove part of your performance gain. Unless you have specialised hardware (embedded, BlueGene) the benefits are marginal in my opinion.

We of course enforce that in `spkg-install`. 

> which will remove part of your performance gain.

Not necessarily, depends on the processor.  You need relative addressing, but not indirect function calls, and most symbols will get resolved at .so build time, not when loading the shared library. 

> Unless you have specialised hardware (embedded, BlueGene) the benefits are marginal in my opinion.

Hmmm, but having a static library included in the Python extension module (which of course is a shared library) prevents us from further headaches, too, IMHO. :-)

It is not obvious that `znoexecstack` is at fault but I cannot rule it out.

I am otherwise in the camp that says dynamic linking is actually the lesser trouble :)

P.S.: Actually `libgmp.a` should get linked into the Python extension module as well, but that's currently not the case.

Interesting `znoexecstack` is not a problem building static - it is probably just ignored but build shared with `ECM_CONFIGURE="--enable-shared --disable-static`

And that definitely kills the linking. So we will need to remove it from upstream sources.

Yes once you link static stuff you need to provide all the bits (dependencies) since static libraries are dumb objects.

Presumably unrelated, but 7.2.beta5?

What "architecture" in Apple speak do the object files in libecm.a have?

That's just the tarball I initially downloaded, but I pulled the latest develop and then your branch. I fully rebuild not so long ago.

Good question, I'll see if I can figure it out.

It's not used at all when building static stuff, or more precisely, only when building `libecm.la`.

Well, patch a comma into it.  (It's in `Makefile.am` and hence also in what's built from it.)

That is, in the _source tarball_ only one instance in the top-level `Makefile.in`.

I wouldn't even use `patch` for that... ;-)


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-03 22:33:25

But I'm really in favour of submitting something upstream that in `configure` adds `-Wa,--noexecstack` to `CCASFLAGS` when supported (or maybe `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` to some `*LDFLAGS`).

May be you wouldn't. But in terms of sage, I would do a `spkg-src`. You can only be that dirty in a big collaborative project of that kind for so long. That kind of stuff just doesn't scale and hurt you in the long term.

In my opinion the whole `spkg-install` is overdone. Just let the build system do its job unless you want to produce a binary.


+1 for a report upstream.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-03 22:40:41

It's just always a headache to patch autotools files, and `spkg-src` is IMHO not a good idea unless you pull some svn version (as opposed to a released tarball), or really remove loads of unnecessary files in order to keep the tarball small.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-03 22:45:59

(Sage's "build system" doesn't yet support upstream tarball URLs though, and the "design" of for example `checksums.ini` is ... -- can't say that here.)

No comment. I am the sage-on-gentoo maintainer - anything I say on the matter is kind of political.

Back to our little problem on OS X. It looks like it is something done in `spkg-install`, going to a sage shell and the build location I just do 

```
make distclean
./configure # by default only build static
make
```

is successful and 

```
(sage-sh) fbissey`@`Mirage:src$ make check
Making check in x86_64

```

so it is definitely the configuration/environment from `spkg-install`, the configuration picked up sage's gcc as the compiler and sage's mpir as gmp without a hitch and assembly code has been used.

```patch
#20385:  Fix currently hardcoded '-Wl,znoexecstack' because
there's a space missing.  (E.g. Apple's linker bails out on
'-znoexecstack', while GNU ld just treats it as if it was
'-z noexecstack', the correct form.)

This is an ugly, temporary fix until we submit something
better upstream.

First of all, 'configure' should check whether this is / which
options are supported and add them based on that, and it's
presumably better to just put '-Wa,--noexecstack' into
CCASFLAGS when the assembler supports that option.

With that I have 

```

now when enabling shared libraries on OS X. At least that's consistent with the man page.

Well, post the part of the log where `spkg-install` prints all the relevant environment variables and `configure` options passed.

What does `gcc -c -Wa,--noexecstack foo.c` give?  (`foo.c` at your like, e.g. `void foo() {}`.)

(And probably also `gcc -v -o foo ...` without `-c`.)

Interestingly, `ld` there didn't bail out on `-z noexecstack`, for whatever reason.  (Did it at all get invoked?)

Otherwise I'm stuck at libtool weirdness and what Apple's ld considers "not x86_64 architecture". 

Also, while we have

```
checking for gcc option to produce PIC... -fno-common -DPIC
checking if gcc PIC flag -fno-common -DPIC works... yes
checking if gcc static flag -static works... no
}}} 
only `-fPIC` is used (which we add in `spkg-install`).

And libtool _of course^TM^_ keeps building `.o` *and* `.lo` files, and both `foo.a` and `foo.la`.

Found the bit that cause problem `--with-gmp=${SAGE_LOCAL}` without it configure tells me

```
configure: Configuration:

```

and the build succeeds. With it

Rebuilding develop branch from scratch to make sure `mpir` is as sane as it can be.

I thought of that, but you told me _"the configuration picked up sage's gcc as the compiler *and sage's mpir* as gmp without a hitch"_ and I was wondering whether that's due to Sage GCC's configuration.

\\

But before my internet connection went down the drain 8/ I was about to post:

----

And then I'd need a log from your successful "manual" build (`make distclean && ./configure && make`) from within a Sage subshell to compare with.

OTOH the only (major) difference -- regarding the environment when `configure` is invoked -- should be `-fPIC` in `CFLAGS`, as ECM picks up MPIR's when `CFLAGS` are empty / not set (which is the case in a Sage subshell unless you've set them yourself).

Not sure how libtool reacts to that, or whether there's anything in `configure` that's influenced by that.

----

Now clearly the difference seems to (also) be that you don't have a static libgmp installed system-wide.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-04 02:08:38

I don't even have a dynamic one. 

The environment passes `-L${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib` and `-Wl,-rpath=${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib`, further the configure script identifies `gmp` as being in fact `mpir` in both case. So the `-lgmp` picked can only be from `${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib`. 

Even further when outside of the sage shell configure bails out because it cannot find any gmp. So the only gmp available is in sage's install.

On another front I separately tried to add `-fPIC` to CFLAGS for configuration and that wasn't a problem. Just adding `-fPIC` lead to a successful compilation. 

libgmp.a or the process of using libgmp.a wholesale is causing trouble. Using libgmp.a that way tries to fold the gmp archive inside libecm.a (so you don't need to link with libgmp.a as it is already inside), apparently it causes trouble on OS X. Possibly something in `mpir` rather than `ecm` in my opinion.

It shouldn't.  You cannot "fold" a static library into another, you can include object files from one into another, or when you build a _shared_ library, include object files into the former (as needed -- symbols get resolved and the object files from which they originate get included, all ending up in the same single text segment etc.).

\\

Wondering whether we build MPIR's/GMP's static library also with PIC.  (Btw., ECM also has `--with-pic`.)

\\

My guess is rather that it's ECM's fault.

Looks like it (MPIR, not explicitly we) does (`-fPIC -DPIC`).

and that's presumably the entry Apple's `ld` complains about (and instead of ignoring the entry, it drops the whole archive, libecm.a).

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-04 07:07:52

I guess this is the culprit (in `Makefile.am`, line 61):

```make
libecm_la_LIBADD += $(GMPLIB)
```

(In `Makefile.in`, on line 719.)

\\

New tentative patch:

```diff
#20385:  Don't put $(GMPLIB) (=libgmp.a) into libecm.a, as Darwin's
linker bails out on nested archives.  Probably a weird idea anyway,
or some libtool bug, as it's presumably supposed to add *the contents*
(i.e., the object files) of libgmp.a into libecm.a.

Note that this new patch gets applied _before_ the other one, so I had to change the latter as well since they unfortunately overlap.  (But the first I added will get dropped later anyway, if Darwin's linker doesn't understand `-z ...` *and* also errors out on it.)

Yes, removing that bit looks right. After all it is already added to `LDFLAGS` by `configure`. For the record I successfully installed ecm-7.0.3 on OS X with the following change

```diff

     echo >&2 "Error configuring GMP-ECM."

Just doing that removes `libgmp.a` from the `ar` call

I wouldn't think so. Using `libgmp.la` means that it has to be present on the system. Relying on an installed, external to your project, `.la` file is extremely fragile. In any case I don't appear to have any `lib{gmp,mpir}.la` installed on OS X so it would fail - miserably.

But AFAICS that wouldn't be a regression w.r.t. GMP-ECM 6.4.4 at least...

François, could you test this (adding the latter to `Makefile.am`)?

I don't have automake 1.15 installed...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-04 08:49:15

Just looked at ecm's `configure.ac`. I am not impressed but I guess this is geared towards static linking. However the proper way tp link statically is not add `$path_to/libname.a`, if you have gcc you pass `-static`.

I can test adding that stuff, give me a few minutes (i may suffer from interruptions from a 5 year old that needs to go to bed).

But that apparently doesn't work on Darwin, as in your log we had:

```
checking if gcc static flag -static works... no
```

Not sure what libtool magic offers.

Passing `foo.a` is certainly safer and more portable.

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-04 09:13:42

One to bed. libtool as an `-all-static` mode for linking program that use only static libraries, not sure how it applies on OS X. But you cannot do that with libraries. You don't link static libraries, you just just `ar`+`ranlib` or equivalent. Folding one library in another is probably frowned on by libtool.

No, that's exactly what it does with `$(MULREDCLIBRARY)` (aka `libmulredc.[l]a`), and it doesn't nest the archive, but "flattens" both libraries / archives into one.

(And there's also `ld -r ...`, but merging all object files into one is even more crude and will not always work.)

The meaning of `--enable-shared` isn't always clear.

Of course, you want a shared library (also) built, but that doesn't necessarily imply you want it itself to be dynamically linked (to libraries it depends on, no matter whether also built by the package or externally supplied).

I'd add an option `--prefer-static[-gmp]`, say, in addition.

P.S.:  IMHO the real bug in what you pointed out is that ECM allows to build static and dynamic libraries _at the same time_, so it should (if present) define and use both `GMPLIB` (static) and `GMPDYLIB` (say, shared).

I spent some time with the libtool mailing list and done some experiments. If you want to have a full static binary (program only), you will have to add `-all-static` to ${prog}_LDFLAGS. If you miss one of dependent library in static form: boom

```
/bin/sh ./libtool  --tag=CC   --mode=link x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-gcc  -g -O1 -march=native -pipe -ggdb -all-static -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -O1 -march=native -pipe -ggdb  -o ecm ecm-auxi.o ecm-b1_ainc.o ecm-candi.o ecm-eval.o ecm-main.o ecm-resume.o ecm-getprime_r.o aprtcle/ecm-mpz_aprcl.o ecm-memusage.o libecm.la -lgmp -lrt -lm -lm -lm -lm -lm

```


In a normal scenario it is ok to build both static and dynamic at the same time. The dynamic library can be linked to the dependent libraries and the static one usually doesn't incorporate the dependent libraries (whatever you want to call the process). 

The `--enable-{shared,static}` are concerning the building of libraries only. It doesn't say anything about programs which will be linked the default way unless you take steps.

You are right there is problem here when you try to build both static and dynamic libraries because the static one can use a deifferent recipe from normal if a static gmp is also available. At that point we have a break down.

The intent is probably to really have a mega-archive libecm.a including libgmp.a - while it is ok to incorporate internal libraies it is doubtful to do it with external ones. The best, sane, option I can offer is to compile the `ecm` executable all static if libgmp.a is available.

I think this is (almost) what we want:

```diff
#20385:  After having removed $(GMPLIB) from libecm_la_LIBADD,
put it into libecm_la_LDFLAGS again, such that a dynamic library
(if built) won't be underlinked.

(I think this was ECM's intention.)

In `Makefile.am` you want to change line 52 which already has a definition for `libecm_la_LDFLAGS`.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-04 11:29:31

We should really ask upstream what they want(ed) or intend(ed), for example it IMHO makes sense to build statically linked programs (or incorporate libgmp.a) provided a static libgmp is available, unless `--disable-static` was given.

Building "everything" dynamically linked just because `--enable-shared` was (also) given IMHO doesn't make sense here.

(And I'd actually incorporate libgmp.a into libecm.so unless specified otherwise, which would require a new `configure` option.)

Oh-oh, it seems the last patch brings back `ar cru libecm.a libgmp.a ...` when building _only_ a static library...


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-05 10:15:52

I think we are majorly bike shedding.

Things to do:
1) -z noexecstack is a gnu ld option. Doesn't work on OS X. Change this and get it upstream.

2) if you provide enough info to configure to get the path to libgmp.a (not just detecting that you can link to gmp) and you build a static libecm then the build system will try to include libgmp.a in libecm.a.
* this fails on OS X
* if you build both a static and dynamic library interesting things will probably happen to the dynamic library, especially if libgmp.a has not been compiled with `pic` flags.
8 this is a recipe to squeeze as much performance as possible by getting an all static linking - it is possible to get the `ecm` binary compiled all static in some more portable ways (I think).

Number (2) is occurring in sage because we pass the install path to gmp/mpir when it is not needed to get gmp detected. This is my comment:76.

(1) has to be talked about with upstream (2) can easily build by adopting comment:76 in spkg-install.


---

Comment by leif created at 2016-08-05 10:39:28

Yep.

For 1) we can just patch out `-Wl,znoexecstack` here and add it (or `-Wa,--noexecstack`) back in `spkg-install` when appropriate (i.e., supported; presumably just Linux or probably [recent] GAS).

And submit something upstream later.

To 2 ), dropping `--with-gmp` should IMHO only be a temporary work-around.

Is this sufficient or do we (still) have to patch out (the apparently plain wrong, with a static library at least)

```make
libecm_la_LIBADD += $(GMPLIB)
```

?

I'll be back in a couple of hours...

It is sufficient. I don't think `Makefile.am` is wrong. It is just feed something toxic in a corner case which upstream goes to great length to create. 

Generally speaking OS X doesn't like static libraries much (still doable but some things are made difficult or more limited). So it probably should be avoided there.

I guess there are two main things we'll have to deal with:
* `-Wl,znoexecstack` only works with gnu ld. It causes OS X ld to choke.
* building against libgmp.a is also not working on OS X. That can be filtered out in configure.ac with an extra test in the logic to select `pathto/libgmp.a`

That's on top of my head.

Posting back the issue I reported on #21223:
* on cygwin64, the assebmly for redc uses the GOT which is not supported on Windows when `WANT_ASSERT` is set and it is by default (passing `--disable-assert` circumvents the problem).

I'll now try different combinations of `--enable-asm-redc` and `--enable-sse2` on Cygwin32 and Cygwin64 and report.

On my side, `make check` passes on a x86_64 machine with Cygwin32 passing `--enable-sse2 --enable-asm-redc`.

Same under Cygwin64 (modulo rebasing issues and passing `--disable-assert`).

I would say it's a bug.
The assembly should be modified because:
* `GOT` is not supported on Windows (where everything is alway PIC),
* the `call` syntax is broken on OS X.
Using `--disable-assert` is just a workaround as it excludes the harming code.
Note that we could still live without asserts on Cygwin and OS X.

Good!

about the issue from comment [comment:121] (GOT not supported on Windows), I can't help on that. Please can someone provide a patch?

Since the noexecstack issue is now solved in the development version, it only remains to solve the libgmp.a issue, for which Francois is working on a patch.

> about the issue from comment [comment:121] (GOT not supported on Windows), I can't help on that. Please can someone provide a patch?
Note that the assembly line from [comment:121] gives issues on OS X not Windows:

```
call abort`@`plt
```

The problematic line on Windows from #21223 is the previous one which uses:

```
$_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE
```


The workaround I suggested is to use `--disable-assert` as both these lines are surrounded by a (`m4`-equivalent) of `#ifdef HAVE_ASSERT`.

A proper fix would be to:
* find equivalent assembly on OS X and Windows to keep asserts support,
* or always disable this code path on OS X and Windows.

This comes from:
https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/ecm/trunk/x86_64/mulredc1.asm?r1=1460&r2=1526
and yes it is not portable!

In fact this only appeared here because in configure.ac (https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/viewvc.php/ecm/trunk/configure.ac?view=markup#l51):

```
dnl Assertions are enabled by default for beta/rc releases.
```

Comment by zimmerma created at 2016-08-25 12:09:05

thank you Jean-Pierre. If we go back to revision 1460, would it solve the OS X and Windows issues?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-08-25 12:18:53

Not completely sure if you mean go back to r1460 for OS X and Windows only or for all Oses.

Whatsoever, with no testing and realknowledge of what I'm talking about, I'd say that indeed using:
* using the r1460 code on Windows should do the trick: there the code is always PIC and hopefully no dark magic is needed to call abort;
* using the r1460 code on OS X I have no idea but it cannot be worse than now: binaries are not ELF, so no PLT, not sure if the simple `call` would always work in both shared and static libraries.
As far as Linux is concerned :
* either always use the r1526 code which according to the commit message always works,
* or use it only in PIC code and use the r1460 in non-PIC code.


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2016-08-25 12:25:38

I was meaning go back to r1460 in all cases. But I now propose to simply remove this WANT_ASSERT stuff in the assembly code. Anyway if something goes wrong, it will be detected by the assertions in the C code.

Paul


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-08-25 12:32:13

Sure that's the more portable and easiest to maintain solution.

(And after a few more seconds searching about OS X, it might be the case that the toolchain there does the plt or equivalent black magic by itself.)


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2016-08-25 13:46:25

the WANT_ASSERT stuff has been removed in upstream revision 2981.
This should solve the OS X and Windows issues.

the patch for the libgmp.a issue on OS X is integrated in upstream revision 2982.
Are all known issues solved now?

PS: I'll probably make a 7.0.4 patch release since a bug was reported in mpres_pow().

Comment by zimmerma created at 2016-08-30 13:53:32

Francois, I guess you are compiling GMP-ECM with MPIR, not with GMP.
Since there is currently no public FFT interface for GMP, and the internal functions differ between GMP and MPIR, I decided to only support the GMP side.
Thus unless someone volunteers to maintain GMP-ECM up to date with changes in MPIR
(apparently fft_adjust_limbs now disappeared), MPIR will not be supported any more.

Paul


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-08-30 21:09:30

Indeed I was compiling from inside a sagemath install with `mpir`. Which of course is the default in this case. Your comments make me wonder about what is happening on the linux side. Anyone???


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-08-31 16:10:09

As long as this only fails with `--enable-assert` we could live with that failure.
From a quick discussion with Bill Hart, I don't see anything on the MPIR side to converge back to the GMP interface in the near future.

I'll test on Linux when I find some time this week.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-09-01 09:29:24

I get the same failure on Linux with `--enable-assert`:

```
tune-mpmod.o: In function `__ecm_mpres_mul_z_to_z':
/home/jpflori/trunk/mpmod.c:1594: undefined reference to `fft_adjust_limbs'

/home/jpflori/trunk/mpmod.c:1419: undefined reference to `fft_adjust_limbs'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

No issue with `--disable-assert`.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2016-10-11 09:06:11

Is there really any more work needed here?
Wait for a new upstream dot release ?
Add `--disable-assert` to our configuration?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2016-10-11 09:11:07

I guess we should check if 7.0.4 is out and use `--disable-assert`.

I have a branch sitting there and for some reasons I don't remember I didn't push. I'll have to examine what it is. It is not finished in any case as changes in ecm interfaces are not yet taken into account in sage. It is just the package right now.

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-03-19 05:17:02

I should compare it to the debian one. I was hoping that a debian or arch dev would finish the ticket so they can be properly credited but obviously someone else will have to.

Looks like a race condition in the test suite.

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-05-12 23:32:09

Yes, from Makefile.am

```
longcheck: ecm$(EXEEXT)
        $(srcdir)/test.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
        $(srcdir)/test.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -no-ntt"
        $(srcdir)/test.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -modmuln"
        $(srcdir)/test.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -redc"
        $(srcdir)/test.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -mpzmod"
        $(srcdir)/test.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
        $(srcdir)/test.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -no-ntt"
        $(srcdir)/test.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -modmuln"
        $(srcdir)/test.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -redc"
        $(srcdir)/test.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -mpzmod"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -no-ntt"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -modmuln"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -redc"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -mpzmod"
        $(srcdir)/test.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT) -treefile tree"
        $(srcdir)/testlong.pp1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
        $(srcdir)/testlong.pm1 "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
        $(srcdir)/testlong.ecm "$(VALGRIND) ./ecm$(EXEEXT)"
```

and on both bots the test are probably with `-j8`. Each instance of `test.pp1` can write `test.pp1.save`. There could be similar problem with other tests. The only solution, I think, is to run the longcheck serially.
