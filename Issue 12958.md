Summary: Adding support for rings in projective spaces.

See comments from: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/HXXqQ_XP358


point.py:

-no automatic normalization (as is currently done with fields)

-implemented __eq__ and __ne__, added a note in __cmp__ for ell_point.py that __eq__ and __ne__ are implemented for projective points

-implemented scale_by() - scales the coordinates by a given amount

-implemented normalize_coordinates() - removes the gcd of the coordinates


morphism.py:

-no automatic gcd removal (even over CC this does not work)
This change reverses part of Trac: 3964 (http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3964)

-removed "immutable" for .__polys since you can scale projective coordinates

-added "check" to __call__ to help deal with indeterminacies and allow for bypassing the initialization checks for points

-implemented scale_by() - scales the coordinates by a given amount

-implemented normalize_coordinates() - removes the gcd of the coordinates


homset.py:

-allowed rings


projective_space.py:

-implemented dimension() - since the current implementation was giving incorrect values when the base ring is a ring (for example ZZ)


general changes:

-added many examples

-cleaned up imports

Just to be sure, I ran a longtest just on interfaces/r.py, and all tests passed, which is unsurprising, since this patch doesn't touch that fileâ€¦not sure what to do about that one.

For the original patch:
* `NOTES::` should be formatted as `.. note::`
* Names of methods, types, etc. should be at the very least double quoted like ```__eq__``` or better yet referred to like `:class:`ValueError``
* Why `_element_constructor_` was removed? It is part of the coercion framework and it is likely that it has to be present.

* `dimension` method is defined to just return `relative_dimension` Why??? `dimension` does work already and works differently:
 {{{
sage: ProjectiveSpace(3,QQ["y"],'x').dimension_relative()
3
sage: ProjectiveSpace(3,QQ["y"],'x').dimension()
4
}}}
 The patch breaks backward compatibility and makes dimension inconsistent between different spaces.

To answer the questions in the last comment:

The formatting I can address. I had thought I'd followed the conventions, but I'll go back through and check all the changes.

_element_constructor was removed since it was simply returning NotImplemented. As in 
points_projective_field, removing that place holder allows the SchemeHomset_points _element_constructor to be used for point_projective_ring


SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space was moved to have the projective classes together. If it is more standard in Sage to have the _polynomial_ classes together, then I can certainly move it back.


Dimension was changed since it seemed to be not working for projective spaces. Before the new dimension function you would get

sage: ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2,'x').dimension()

2

sage: ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,2,'x').dimension()

3

I assumed that the value for ZZ was wrong. Although it seems that Spec(ZZ).dimension() does in fact return 1 while Spec(QQ).dimension() returns 0. Is this really the desired behavior, that the dimension of projective space over the integers is +1?

It is standard in Sage to keep track of who is doing what and why, if you rearrange a file, then you will be shown as the author of new lines and this ticket will be listed as a reason for its addition. There can be different schemes of arranging names and classes (e.g. I like to have everything alphabetically). I don't think we have any standard conventions for that. But you should never "just move" existing code because of the history loss.

Integers have a chain of prime ideals of length 1, e.g. (0) contained in (2), so its dimension is one. Rationals have dimension zero since there is only one prime ideal (length of the chain is zero), as for other fields.

If you look at the documentation of existing dimension function, you will see that it is indeed supposed to work like this: dimension of the base ring is taken into consideration. Moreover, you can see that there are long names for either way `dimension_absolute` and `dimension_relative`, and just `dimension` is explicitly shown to work as `dimension_absolute`. So it is definitely not a good idea to make this "default" dimension mean relative in the case of projective spaces.

I've made the following changes:

- found and fixed the formatting
- included the docstring fix and the coverage fix from Anna's version
- no longer implement a dimension function
- returned the :class:SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space to its original location

testall passes on my machine.

However, I'm not sure what the right step for the file attachment is. I can replace my original patch with my new one, but cannot replace or remove Anna's version.  Should I replace my original version or upload it as a new (3rd) version?
