We implement functions that allow fast evaluations of integer polynomials with real input:
- `fmpz_poly_eval_mpfr(mpfr_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfr_t a, mpfr_rnd_t rnd)`
- `fmpz_poly_eval_mpfi(mpfi_t res, const fmpz_poly_t poly, const mpfi_t a)`
- `ZZX_eval_mpfr(mpfr_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfr_t a, const mpfr_rnd_t rnd)`
- `ZZX_eval_mpfi(mpfi_t res, ZZX_c poly, const mpfi_t a)`

These functions are integrated in the polynomial code and number field element comparisons (when real embedding is defined, see #17830). For the latter we win a great `x10` speed up. The new code is also is `x50` faster than comparisons in `QQbar`. For the benchmarks, we used the following comparison function

```
def test(a,n):
    cf = continued_fraction(a)
    cv1 = a.parent()(cf.convergent(2*n+1))
    cv2 = a.parent()(cf.convergent(2*n+2))
    for _ in range(200):
        assert cv1 > a > cv2
```

Before

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=1.26)
sage: sage: %timeit test(a,10)
10 loops, best of 3: 51.1 ms per loop
sage: sage: %timeit test(a,20)
10 loops, best of 3: 67 ms per loop
sage: sage: %timeit test(a,100)
10 loops, best of 3: 108 ms per loop
sage: sage: %timeit test(a,200)
1 loops, best of 3: 154 ms per loop
```

after

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=1.26)
sage: sage: sage: %timeit test(a,10)
100 loops, best of 3: 5.84 ms per loop
sage: sage: sage: %timeit test(a,20)
100 loops, best of 3: 10.2 ms per loop

10 loops, best of 3: 33.5 ms per loop
sage: sage: sage: %timeit test(a,200)

To be compared with

```

For 2. I just forward the rounding mode to the mpfr functions. Having exact rounding for polynomials might actually be tricky... and also useful. The main reason for having this option is to handle simply polynomial evaluations with different RealField input.

I know that but it doesn't make sense to do that!

What would be the point of doing every single operation with `MPFR_RNDU`?

You can also command it if you have precise requests ;-)

BTW, I added special cases for degree 0 and 1 and I have seen no difference.

Benchmarks indicate that the bound degree < 10 makes no sense at all. The ratio in speed between the old and the new code does not depend on the degree at all.

I see. I guess that those "random" polynomials are somewhat sparse, so less operations are needed. I will try again with very dense polynomials.

I attached files which compare the various possibilities for Horner scheme:

- `eval1`: the current version which is straightforward Horner expansion (red)
- `eval2`: the same but skip addition if the term is 0 (green)
- `eval3`: use `mpfr_pow` (blue)

There are files `degree_{deg}_{prec}.png` for fixed degrees where the number of terms vary and `poly_{deg}_{nb_terms}.png` where the percision vary.
