Nice solution!  I'm ready to give this a positive review, but is there a reason why you didn't replace `simplify_full` by an element-wise method as well?

The only reason was that didn't want to trash the custom docstring.

Hi Robert,

Good point, but I would still advocate replacing `simplify_full` by an elementwise method: not only does it restore the symmetry between `simplify_full` and the other elementwise methods, your code is also more robust and generic.  And since the docstring for `apply` already has a test for `simplify_full`, the changes are only minimal.

I've gone ahead and made this change to your patch.  If you agree with the changes, I'm ready to give this a positive review (not sure it's OK to do that, but the changes are very minimal).  If not, please delete my patch and I'll approve your original version instead.

Your change looks good, though I noticed that the patch didn't have a good description (which was propagated to your update). Fixed. (Yes, it's totally kosher for the original author to +1 the referee's changes.)

Great!  Thanks for noticing the absence of a good description, I always forget that.
