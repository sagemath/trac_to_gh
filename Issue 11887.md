Apparently [Stephen Montgomery-Smith](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/2feec7c5511c4ae5/857a00a9aa271f17) has had some success with this recently, without any patches (?).

It seems that R now works fine.  See [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/sage-devel/yPGIKHRSANs) in addition to the one previously referenced.
