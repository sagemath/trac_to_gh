With #8703, I got this on `5.9.beta5`:

```
sage -t --long misc/sagedoc.py
**********************************************************************
File "misc/sagedoc.py", line 1039, in sage.misc.sagedoc.?
Failed example:
    len(search_doc('tree', interact=False).splitlines()) > 4000  # long time
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

Are you sure you remembered to run `make doc` after applying the patch?

No I didn't. I ran it and it passed all tests.
