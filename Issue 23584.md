# Issue 23584: Speed up initialization code for trees

Computing the binary tree corresponding to a permutation is surprisingly slow.  I have the following timings:


```
sage: timeit("[pi.binary_search_tree() for pi in Permutations(7)]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 18.4 s per loop
```

`%lprun` tells me that almost all of the time is spent in constructing the tree - output below.  Indeed, if I simply represent my tree as a triple `(left, right, label)` I get the much better

```
sage: timeit("[binary_search_tree(pi) for pi in Permutations(7)]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 455 ms per loop
```


So, my question is: can we improve the sage version so it is only a constant factor slower than the triple-version?  A very similar problem appears with `Permutation.increasing_tree` - so I think my question really is about improving the initialisation code.

My code:

```
def binary_search_insert(self, letter):
    if not self:
        return ([[],[]], letter)
    else:
        if letter <= self[1]:
            fils = binary_search_insert(self[0][0], letter)
            return ([fils, self[0][1]], self[1])
        else:
            fils = binary_search_insert(self[0][1], letter)
            return ([self[0][0], fils], self[1])

def binary_search_tree(self, left_to_right=True):
    res = None
    if left_to_right:
        gen = self
    else:
        gen = self[::-1]
    for i in gen:
        res = binary_search_insert(res, i)
    return res
```

The output of `%lprun` for the sage code:

Using Travis' improvement we are down to

```
sage:  timeit("[pi.binary_search_tree() for pi in Permutations(7)]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 8.81 s per loop
```


We now have:

Here are the data for `BinaryTree.__init__`.  Possibly a tiny improvement might be to test for `None` first, although the logic has to be changed slightly then - the string "None" then needs extra treatment.

couldn't the `if` in line 197 be an `elif`? No, sorry.

I bet you will get a good speedup by turning off the check by passing `check=False` to the constructor.

Unfortunately, this doesn't make any difference here.  What's very strange: I suddenly get timings which are *much* worse (by a factor of 2) - fortunately consistently, the relative difference between versions is the same.  I'll reboot now :-) UPDATE: reboot was helpful, I'm now back to the old timings, but `check=False` doesn't make a difference.

It turns out that I do not understand the purpose of the last few lines in `BinaryTree.__init__`:

```
        if (isinstance(children, str)):  # if the input is the repr of a binary tree
            children = children.replace(".", "None")
            from ast import literal_eval
            children = literal_eval(children)
        if children is None:
            children = []
        elif (isinstance(children, (list, tuple)) and not children or
              isinstance(children, (Integer, int))):
            children = [None, None]
        # now I'm getting lost:
        if (children.__class__ is self.__class__ and
                children.parent() == parent):
            children = list(children)
        else:
            children = [self.__class__(parent, x, check=check) for x in children]
        ClonableArray.__init__(self, parent, children, check=check)
```

If I'm reading the last `if` statement correctly, it makes sure that `children` as passed to `ClonableArray.__init__` is a list of elements of the correct class and with the correct parent.  But then an `elif` would be correct, wouldn't it?  (except that we would have to initialise `children` differently in the lines before)

I am now down to something which looks reasonable:

```
sage: timeit("[pi.binary_search_tree() for pi in Permutations(7)]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 4.67 s per loop
```

Comment by mantepse created at 2017-09-10 21:06:55

as a side effect, new:

```
sage: timeit("[pi.increasing_tree() for pi in Permutations(7)]", number=1, repeat=1)
1 loops, best of 1: 2.44 s per loop
```

old:

```
1 loops, best of 1: 8.93 s per loop
```

Of course, this is all still far from the version which bypasses `BinaryTree` completely.  But I do not see any further improvements.
