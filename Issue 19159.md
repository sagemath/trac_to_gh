I think it would be useful if posets had an `edge_labels()` option where one could assign labels to the covering relations (which would naturally correspond to `edge_labels()` on the underlying Hasse diagram).

This concept is already used in `is_EL_labeling()` (the `{edge_labels()` function is an additional parameter). In tetrahedral posets, the you have six different possible 'colors' of edges you can include, and it would be nice to retain this information as part of the poset structure. For posets like the weak order on a Coxeter group, one would want a labeling of which simple generator you multiply by to decrement the length when travelling down a covering relation. One may want to keep track of which covering relations in the Cartesian product of two posets come from which poset. In the ZigZag poset, one might want to distinguish between 'up' covering relations and 'down' covering relations. And so on.

In principle the most important thing in poset is not "covers", it is "is less or equal". But is this about adding a label to covering relation?

I guess this could be useful addition. About implementing it I know nothing.

Name should of course be `cover_label` or `covering_label`, not `edge_label`.

This is just about covering relations. And as I listed in the description, there are tons of situations where you would want a labeling of the cover relations, and the notion of a labeling for their transitive closure doesn't make much sense.

The name should probably be `cover_labels`, to match the currently existing option for the `plot()` method.

Can we define labels in some natural way in `product()`, `ordinal_product()` etc? What functions would have to change? At least `dual()`, but everything that creates a new poset(s) from old poset(s) should be checked.

This is already implemented -- the `plot` method accepts `cover_labels` option. I suggest closing this ticket.

This isn't just for plotting. This would make the edge labels a persistent part of the poset data.

Changing keywords from "" to "combinat, posets, days94".
