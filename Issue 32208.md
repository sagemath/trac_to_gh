# Issue 32208: Do not access M4RI internals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32445

Original creator: @cbouilla

Keywords: M4RI, matrices

This ticket slightly modifies how M4RI matrices (dense matrices mod 2) are accessed. Instead of accessing the underlying `struct` directly, we use the accessor function. This is a minor change. The point is that the underlying datastrucure in M4RI may change in the future, and we won't break.
