The crystal B<sup>1,s</sup> of type D<sub>4</sub><sup>(3)</sup> is given in Section 4 of

```
.. [KMOY07] M. Kashiwara, K. C. Misra, M. Okado, D. Yamada.
   *Perfect crystals for* `U_q(D_4^{(3)})`, J. Algebra. **317** (2007).
```

using the coordinate representation. This implements this crystal in the Kashiwara-Nakashima representation by translating to the coordinate representation for the affine crystal operators.
