It has 
- some API-based and some file-based interfaces to various solvers (including COIN OSI via yaposib),
- a basic modeling system (need to compare its capabilities with sage frontend)

It would not be a problem for Sage if we just included python-mip as a package in the Sage distribution, for users to install and use.

Yes, there is no new problem of using `python-mip` as an interface to Cbc when one is already using Cbc. 

However, as I wrote in our earlier discussion (with Haroldo and Túlio) in July 2021:

  For Sage, I am shopping for an API offering pivot-level control over solvers that can support several backends, with the goal of replacing our home-grown (wasn't me) design. Given that Python-MIP already supports CBC and Gurobi, it is a viable candidate for this; if it weren't for the license situation [...]

Sorry, Ted, this is all just wildly misguided. 

The authors of software choose GPL as the license because they agree with the widely understood intended interpretation, in particular the strong protections that the GPL intends to provide. 

Whether the implementation by the license text holds up legally, is a secondary matter; the license is, so to say, merely an implementation detail. 

What matters for the open source / free software community is to respect the intent of the authors, as expressed by their choice of license. Saying that their choices are somehow not legitimate because the license is not legally enforceable, or to discuss circumvention techniques based on narrow interpretations of what linking is, all seems pretty out of place.

But COIN-OR's embrace of `python-mip` **has** prompted the license change. 

The old license was a standard permissive license that was compatible with everything: with EPL, with GPL, anything.

> Most have chosen the EPL, following IBM's original lead. Of course, this is partly because it is just easier in terms of license compatibility

Yeah, no. This is the core of the damaging misinformation that is coming from the direction of COIN-OR.

No such thing, it is just specifically incompatible with EPL (without secondary license notice), for a specific technical reason. 

GPL is compatible with a wide range of licenses, in particular all the standard permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache, ...).
