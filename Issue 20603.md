Some encoders/decoders (e.g. Syndrome decoders) are "generic" encoders/decoders which work for any linear code family. 
This ticket implements a very small change which automatically add these generic decoders to any code family assuming one adds a line related to this encoder/decoder into `AbstractLinearCode`'s constructor.
Before, one had to manually add one's encoder/decoder in any module which contains a linear code class.

I implemented the feature described above.
I also added a dedicated note in the thematic tutorial which explains how to create new objects in `sage/coding`.

This is now open for review.

I don't think it makes sense to let all codes have `ParityCheckEncoder`, the reason being that for any code where the default encoder is something else, say `A`, then `ParityCheckEncoder` behaves exactly like `SystematicEncoder`.

This is because `ParityCheckEncoder.generator_matrix` calls
`code.parity_check_matrix().right_kernel()` which always returned a matrix in reduced row echelon form, i.e. the same systematic generator matrix that `SystematicEncoder` uses.

Good point. I made the suggested change and fixed doctests accordingly.
I also removed generic decoders from the list of imports in `grs.py`, `hamming_code.py` and `punctured_code.py` as they are no longer needed there.

Looks good, green light. But found two unrelated small bugs in Sage while testing this ticket :-)
