`gentoo-python3.7` is outdated too since **Michał Górny** disabled python3.7 in Gentoo several weeks ago :(

What about Mac OS? I've seen a claim that Apple officially supports the three most recent versions of the OS — currently 10.14, 10.15, and 11 — and (for example) Mac OS 10.11 became unsupported in August 2018, 10.12 in November 2019, 10.13 in November 2020. I don't know what impact dropping support for 10.11 would have on Sage, but I think I saw a recent post in sage-devel or sage-support from someone struggling to install Sage on this OS.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners only has Catalina and Big Sur. So these systems are the only ones that are systematically tested.

These are also the only versions that we claim to support (for building Sage from source) in https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.3#Availability_of_Sage_9.3_and_installation_help

Without infrastructure for testing, I would be reluctant to make any claims regarding support for older OS releases.


Travis CI does support a wider range of macOS releases, keyed to XCode versions - https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/#macos-version, going back to OS X 10.11. I used to have a workflow on Travis CI to run some superficial tests on a built binary distribution on older macOS versions (see #31133). But there seemed to be little interest in this at the time, and I have not updated these scripts.

Marc Culler appears to be testing his new binary distribution on some older macOS versions.

I think Apple is supporting 3 macOS releases, including the current, 11. This makes everything older than macOS 10.14 obsolete.
