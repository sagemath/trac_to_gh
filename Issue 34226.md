# Issue 34226: make PolynomialQuotientRing_generic inherit from QuotientRing_generic

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34463

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2022-08-31 15:21:27

This will make it easier to write code that works uniformly for all kinds of quotient rings.

(Example: Polynomial quotient rings currently do not have the `.cover()` and `.defining_ideal()` methods, which are very useful when writing generic quotient-ring code.)

There seems to be a test failure

```
File "sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py", line 829, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.hom_velusqrt.EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt
Failed example:
    any(map(check, psi.codomain().isomorphisms(phi.codomain())))
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

and some linting failures

```
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py:325:9: E306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py:327:9: E306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0
sage/functions/special.py:867:12: W605 invalid escape sequence '\p'
sage/functions/special.py:867:19: W605 invalid escape sequence '\p'
sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py:2987:21: E721 do not compare types, use 'isinstance()'
```


The linting problems don't look like they're due to this ticket, but I'm not sure about the test failure.

Thanks for having a look. The test failure is #34467, and the linter errors should go away with #34466.

I think `is_Class` functions that just perform a type test are considered obsolete, so I would write `if not isinstance(x, PolynomialQuotientRing_generic)` instead of calling `is_PolynomialQuotientRing`. Lgtm otherwise!

Resolution: fixed
