This will make it easier to write code that works uniformly for all kinds of quotient rings.

(Example: Polynomial quotient rings currently do not have the `.cover()` and `.defining_ideal()` methods, which are very useful when writing generic quotient-ring code.)

There seems to be a test failure

```
File "sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py", line 829, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.hom_velusqrt.EllipticCurveHom_velusqrt
Failed example:
    any(map(check, psi.codomain().isomorphisms(phi.codomain())))
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

and some linting failures

```

sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/hom_velusqrt.py:327:9: E306 expected 1 blank line before a nested definition, found 0

The linting problems don't look like they're due to this ticket, but I'm not sure about the test failure.

Thanks for having a look. The test failure is #34467, and the linter errors should go away with #34466.

I think `is_Class` functions that just perform a type test are considered obsolete, so I would write `if not isinstance(x, PolynomialQuotientRing_generic)` instead of calling `is_PolynomialQuotientRing`. Lgtm otherwise!
