# Issue 22954: default implementation of inverse_of_unit()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: sd86.5

Not all ring elements provide `inverse_of_unit()`

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: S = R.quo(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: S(1).inverse_of_unit()
NotImplementedError
```


But we should always try to invert and see if the result is in the same parent.
