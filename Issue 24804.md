- Use `.. NOTE::` instead of `.. note::`.
- The stuff in `combinat/tutorial.py` would be better as a separate thematic tutorial (with a link in `combinat/tutorial.py`.
- There is a merge conflict in `combinat/tutorial.py` (look for the `>>>>>>`).
- Latex code is best marked as ``x = 5`` with single ``` (and not preceded by `:math:`).

It would be really nice to have a serious implementation of automata in Sage. The current one `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.Automaton` is really terrible and mostly useless. While possibly much better, the one proposed with this ticket is far from being in a satisfactory shape for inclusion in Sage.

Here are the main relevant things

1. Do you think that having two disjoint implementations will help Sage users? This ticket should come with a plan to replace or at least interact with the code already there.
2. You should **never** use french names for variables and comments. This code is intended to be read/used/improved by people all around the world. (note that it is even worse: you are mixing french and english)
3. You propose to include a lot of C code directly in Sage. This is relevant in the context of automata for speed. But as it is, this code is not properly tested and almost undocumented. Even the doctests of the pyx file are not testing corner cases, real world examples and random instances as it should be.

Some other minor comments

- The components on the ticket is set to `packages: optional` but you are not providing a package. You are simply including source code directly in Sage. This is a thing that you might want to think about: do you prefer inclusion in Sage sources or ship your code as a package?
- There should not be any commented code unless there is a very good reason for that
- In Sage sources (I am talking about `cautomata.pyx`) there are clear design choices that should be followed
    - ``@`property` are mostly not used. Object internal data are accessed with methods. If there is a need for cache you can use ``@`cached_method`.
    - method start with lower case (`Alphabet`)
    - the name should reflect the object and possibly the implementation. `FastAutomaton` and `NFastAutomaton` are poorly choosen.
    - error and print statements are different things. This kind of code should not be there

```
print("Error : Incorrect set of final states.")
```

- This

```
cdef Bool(int x):
    if x:
        return True
    return False
```

     is automatically taken care of by the "special" `bint` type from Cython.
- Docstring should start with an upper case and be informative. For example `zero-complete automaton in the other way` is cryptic.

I use the occasion to share some thoughts about this ticket. This is not the first time that a ticket is created to add a ton of new lines of code into Sage and in too many of those cases, the code just became dead on the sage trac for a ton of different reasons that I will not enumerate here (#21295, #16110, #12224 are examples which are taking years to complete). Therefore, now, I want to make sure that this does not happen again with this ticket since I am very interested in having a fast implementation of automaton available in Sage.

While I think that it is a very good idea that this ticket eventually gets merged into Sage, **I would like to suggest to the authors of this ticket to consider the possibility of creating an independent Python Package containing this code** beside this ticket. To me, this would be benefical for many reasons:
- Python Package are easy to install, use and maintain.
- If some important modifications that are backward incompatible are to be done in your code in the next two years, then no one will bother.

Here are examples of Python packages for Sage:

- https://pypi.org/project/surface_dynamics/ (include Python, Cython, and C code)

Good luck:)

If you intend to include your Python code in Sage sources then

Your usage of `sig_on/sig_off` is very wrong. For example, the function `getDict2` contains Python code on its first line

```
    A = list(A)
```

However, you wrote in the code of the method `duplicate`

```
        sig_on()

        sig_off()

As written in the cysignals documentation, the code between `sig_on/sig_off` should not contain any Python code.
