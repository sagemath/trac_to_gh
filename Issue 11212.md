For some toric algorithms one needs to choose orientations for cones, essentially to construct the homology complex of the cone complex. This patch implements new methods `fan.oriented_boundary(cone)` and `fan.complex()` to return chosen boundary orientations of cones and the resulting homology complex.

1. In `oriented_boundary` can we replace throughout `cone` with something more neutral, like `cell` or `part`, since it is allowed to be the whole fan?
   1. What exactly is "outward normal first" orientation?
   2. How about representing the output of `oriented_boundary` as a formal sum with plus/minus 1 coefficients? Wouldn't it be more convenient?
   3. It would be nice to be more clear what is arbitrary and what is not. As I understand, the only randomness is in the choice of orientation of non-full-dimensional *generating* cones, the rest is then determined.
   4. To reduce randomness of the last case, perhaps one can compute the determinant of the pivot matrix of the (cone rays | identity) matrix)? It may perhaps be also a little faster than working with quotients.
   5. The code crashes on
   {{{
sage: fan = toric_varieties.P(3).fan() 
sage: cone = fan(0)[0] 
sage: fan.oriented_boundary(cone) 
}}}
1. Are there any references that would be suitable to put into documentation of `complex` method? What is it used for and what is computed by its homology groups? Is it possible to have torsion? I guess yes, since QQ would be faster otherwise, but it would be nice to have an example!
2. Would be nice also to say something about the differential maps and why it is possible to define the extended complex for complete fans.
3. "The orientation of each cone is chose as..." must be "chosen".
4. Is there a reason why "-1" term is printed in the end? It looks like a bug (not in this patch, of course).

   10. in the `homology()` of a simplicial complex? It probably depends on the algorithm that `SimplicialComplex` uses to compute the homology.
