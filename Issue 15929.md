dkrenn mentioned in #15003 that the general factorial-function should check if the element has `.factorial` and executes it. Only if not, it comes up with solution on its own. (I have not checked the current implementations; its just came in my mind by thinking about it). IE to add the following to the factorial() call in sage/functions/other.py

```
try:
    number.factorial()
except AttributeError:
    <do the rest>
```

Since the `function/` factorial overrides the `arith/` version (#17489) the `symbolic.Function` machinery gets used and it exactly does what is asked for in this ticket, i.e. checking for a `.factorial()` member function.

However, as can be seen from the updated description the `py_factorial()` helper does not catch `ValueError`s so the existing mechanics fail for some types, so I updated the description.
