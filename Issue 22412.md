It seems that the current state of this ticket has the following effect:

**Before**, comparison of an element of projective space Pn with "other" tried (by itself) to convert "other" to an element of Pn

**After**, no such conversion is performed. This means that comparison behaves differently, for example P1(0,1) == 0 is not True.

This should rather be fixed by a proper coercion, maybe ?

No. I try to avoid looking at this low level stuff so if tests still pass and it is no slower to test equality of points on elliptic curves then go ahead.
