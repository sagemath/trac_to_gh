# Issue 24346: py3: additional fixes to sage.interfaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24583

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-01-22 16:30:14

In #24269 I made some initial fixes to `sage.interfaces` just to get a minimum of functionality working.

This adds on top of that some additional fixes to `sage.interfaces.interface` and `sage.interfaces.expect` that were needed in getting the rest of the `sage.interfaces` tests passing.

I'll follow up with additional tickets with fixes for the program-specific interfaces.

This probably needs to be rebased on current #24269

Apparently all that's left of this ticket that isn't already merged is a few more minor fixes for the maxima interface, so I'll just add that to #24269 and close this ticket.
