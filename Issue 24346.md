In #24269 I made some initial fixes to `sage.interfaces` just to get a minimum of functionality working.

This adds on top of that some additional fixes to `sage.interfaces.interface` and `sage.interfaces.expect` that were needed in getting the rest of the `sage.interfaces` tests passing.

I'll follow up with additional tickets with fixes for the program-specific interfaces.
