CC:  wuthrich

Chris Wuthrich reported that

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('100467a2')
sage: E.database_attributes()
{'conductor': 100467,
 'cremona_label': '100467a2',
 'rank': 1,
 'torsion_order': 1}
```

although the database does contain the generators:

```
sage: CremonaDatabase().allgens(100467)['a2']
[[7465870518064287, 219103670535029299, 7758864174573]]
```


It seems that (in two palces) the code to extract the data from the database wrongly assumes that some data only exists for the first curve in each isogeny class, which is not true.

A simple fix to sage/databases/cremona.py is on its way.

You should add a doctest and annotate it with

```
# optional - database_cremona_ellcurve
```

There are many such tests already in `src/sage/databases/cremona.py`.

Ok. I fixed a tiny sphinx error on that page, too.

I did test cremona.py, but I have not run the complete test again after the last changes which only affect the docstring in that file. If anyone finds that inacceptable, then I will run them.
