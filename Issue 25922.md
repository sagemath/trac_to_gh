# Issue 25922: Make it possible to run optional doctests in isolation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @timokau

Original creation time: 2018-08-29 20:49:23

Currently most tests marked as optional assume that all unmarked tests are always run, for example


```
a = 42
b = a + 1 # optional - something
```


This will fail when the testsuite is run with `--optional=something`. It needs to be run with `--optional=sage,something` instead.

One way to fix this would be to always run all the unmarked lines in a doctest that contains an included optional keyword. So if there were two doctests:


```
> a = 1
> a == 1
True
```


and


```
> a = 1
> b = a + 1 # optional - something
> a == 1
True
```


and the doctests were run with `--optional=something` the first doctest wouldn't be run but the second doctest would be run completely.

This would probably need significant changes in the doctesting framework.

I don't really understand what you want. What you write here is not the same issue as the issue of `--optional=sage` that we were discussing on #26110. I don't know whether this is intentional or not. In any case: I can probably fix the issue of #26110 easily but not this ticket.

I think that we want the capability to mark single lines as optional: we want to be able to do

```
sage: a = something
sage: b = something else
sage: test something involving a and b
sage: test something optional involving a and b # optional - TAG
```

The first three lines may be meaningful to test even in the absense of TAG, so I don't want to skip the whole block by default. People have in the past discussed the idea of marking entire blocks as optional, but this was discarded. Too confusing for users because they might miss the "optional" marking, especially in a big block? I don't remember why.

Just brainstorming here, but we could also implement different optional markings:

```
sage: blah # optional - TAG
sage: blah # optional - +TAG
sage: blah # optional - |TAG
sage: blah # optional - &TAG
```

for example. One of these might mean that the line should only be tested with `sage` included, another might mean that it should pass just with `TAG`, etc.

I could also imagine something like `sage -t --optional=!dochtml,latex ...`, meaning that testing should skip lines marked `dochtml` but include `latex`, etc.

It is intended to be the same issue (generalized): optional tags cannot be tested without also testing all of sage. We must have some different understanding of the issue. Why do you think its not the same? And how do you propose to fix the issue in #26110 easily?

Yes that would be possible with my proposal. `--optional=sage` would work as it does now while `--optional=a,b` would run the `a` and `b` tests but also run all their context. So if *any* line in a doctest is marked as either `a` or `b`, all the unmarked lines are ran too. That leads to some duplication of course but significantly less than including `sage` in the `--optional` list.

That is what I had in mind when I talked about AND vs OR logic in #26110 and would be a nice solution. Not sure how compatible that (or any other solution) is with the doctesting framwork is however.

How would that be different from just leaving `dochtml` from the list?

It depends on how the `py2` tag is treated, or if other tags have special treatments.

I interpreted the issue of #26110 (which is also what I discussed in my sage-devel post) as: the meaning of `--optional` is really strange when you omit `sage` and in particular it causes `--optional=mypkg` tests to fail.

Being able to run optional tests without running all Sage tests (this ticket) is related, but I don't see it as the same issue.

What I dislike about your "solution" in #25345 that I reverted in #26110 is that it makes the first issue (`--optional=sage` having a special meaning) even worse.

Here is a possible solution for this ticket: have the doctester take two options `--optional` and `--force-optional` (or something with a better name). When testing with `--optional=A --force-optional=B` (where A and B are sets of packages), this is treated as `--optional=A,B` but only doctest blocks containing `# optional - b` tags for every package b in B will be tested.

That is a legitimate UX issue but not the reason I made the change for py2. Just taking away the option to run optional tests without the "sage" tests does solve the ux issue but not my usecase.

> Being able to run optional tests without running all Sage tests (this ticket) is related, but I don't see it as the same issue.

At least solving this ticket would also solve the UX issue.

I don't see how the current situation ("everything breaks without `sage`") can be made worse by a small change that makes it "most things break without `sage`". That discussion belongs in #26110 though and doesn't seem to go anywhere.

Can you elaborate? Why wouldn't `# optional - a` packages be tested? What is the difference between `--optional` and `--force-optional`?

Another related possibility that I've been wanting for a quite a while is to create a custom rst directive named something like `.. doctest:`.  It would be treated by Sphinx no differently than a normal verbatim block, but we could pass various options to it that can be parsed by the doctest parser, and apply those options to the entire block.

This would solve a lot of problems that we make for ourselves by having various doctest flags apply only to single lines.

I don't really understand which part you don't understand, so just a re-explanation of my proposal:

Consider a test run with `--optional=A --force-optional=b` where `A` is a set of packages and `b` is a single package. Then this would test only doctest blocks containing at least one `# optional - b` test. Within those blocks, it would run all `# optional - a` tests for `a` in `A` and also `# optional - b` tests.

What kind of options are you thinking about?

Ah, right that also makes sense. My earlier proposal would then essentially be to always behave like `--force-optional` but it couldn't hurt to allow both.

People have thought about this before but not done anything about it. If you are thinking of replacing all test blocks with ones marked `.. doctest:`, it is daunting and it is also not clear how to proceed. But if you want to implement it and start to introduce it slowly, that sounds okay.

Regarding my remark "not clear how to proceed", I mean for example this kind of thing:

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: some stuff
    sage: some stuff

Here is a comment, but the next part should be in the same block as the previous::

    sage: more stuff
    sage: more stuff

Here is another comment, but probably the next part should be a new block::

    sage: and more
    sage: and more   # optional - my_great_package
```

I think we want to allow doctest blocks of this form.
