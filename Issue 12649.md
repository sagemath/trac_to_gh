Assignee: GeorgSWeber

If CC="gcc -m32" (for example), then the following will fail:

```
$ testcc.sh $CC
Usage: spkg/bin/testcc.sh name_or_path_to_the_C_compiler
[...]
```

We should allow `testcc.sh` to accept multiple arguments and use all of them to run the C compiler.

Stylewise, I'd use `[ $# -lt  1 ]`.

The usage should say "`$0 name_or_path_to_the_C_compiler [optional arguments]`".

I'd also use `$`@`` instead of `"$`@`"`, then quoting `$CC` doesn't hurt (so you wouldn't have to change the M4RIE spkg either), and the latter won't work as probably expected.

It's also a bit funny to use `grep ... | sed ...`; a single invocation of `sed` is sufficient.  (At least he didn't use `... | cat | ...` ;-) )

I think quoting `$CC` should hurt because it's wrong.

One must not run

```
"$CC" foo.c -o foo
```
so I think one should also not run

```
testcc.sh "$CC"
```

You can't say it's wrong.  But using `"$`@`"` would only make sense if one e.g. did

```sh
testcc.sh "$CC" "some argument with spaces" otherargument
# (if $CC is actually a single pathname with spaces in it)

# or, likewise
testcc.sh $CC "some argument with spaces" otherargument
```
which I think nobody will do.

Positive review for the patch to `testcc.sh` **if you remove the extra `grep`**... ;-)




The (patch to the) M4RIE spkg needs work anyway:

```sh
if [ "$COMPILER"  = "GNU" ] ; then 
    ...
```

(`testcc.sh` never returns `GNU`, at most `GCC`.)

A few more comments:

* The scripts could respect `TMP` and `TMPDIR` if set.

* On Cygwin `-o foo` will create `foo.exe`, so that should (also) be removed.

* Using `sed -n '/^[A-Z]/s/ //gp'` is much faster than `sed -n 's/ //g;/^[A-Z]/p'`.

* In `spkg/install`, there should be a way to bypass the installation of GCC (if the compiler isn't GCC), e.g. if `SAGE_PORT=yes` (?).  Or is there already such?

>  * In `spkg/install`, there should be a way to bypass the installation of GCC (if the compiler isn't GCC), e.g. if `SAGE_PORT=yes` (?).  Or is there already such?


Doesn't look like.  (Although one can set `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`.)

Quite unrelated, but from `spkg/install` (i.e., while we're at it):

```sh
if [ -z "$SAGE_FORTRAN" ]; then
    if command -v gfortran >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=gfortran
    elif command -v g95 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=g95
    elif command -v g77 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; then
        SAGE_FORTRAN=g77
    fi
fi
```
ignores settings of `FC` and `F77`, the standard variables containing the Fortran compiler.

The created `sage_fortran` script hardcodes `-m64` (and ignores `FFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS` etc.).

Don't know whether that's really intentional, but also the *current setting* of `SAGE_FORTRAN` is hardcoded into the script, such that later changing `SAGE_FORTRAN` has no effect.

What's `TMP`?  I agree on `TMPDIR`, which is the standard way of specifying a temporary directory.

Fair enough.

Those two commands aren't equivalent.

You can set `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`.

I apparently had trailing spaces on the lines with compiler names...

```sh
sed -n '/^[A-Z]/s/[ ]*//gp'
```

That's stupid:

```
bsd:~ jdemeyer$ clang -march=foobar foo.c -c -o foo.o
'foobar' is not a recognized processor for this target (ignoring processor)
bsd:~ jdemeyer$ echo $?
0
```

This could mean that MPIR for example might produce very suboptimal code because it *thinks* that `-march=foo` is supported when it's not.
