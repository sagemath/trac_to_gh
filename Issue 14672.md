Yes, that's what I meant.

It *is* finished, you just have to include the (`$MAKE`-related) patches.

I rebased Jean-Pierre's spkg at #2114 on mine, but then Jeroen felt he had to make trivial changes to that again, so that I would now again have to *rebase mine* on that of #2114, but that doesn't make sense if you're going to create a 6.0.0 anyway.

Groumpf, you just prevented me from posting that:

Please don't produce any spkg yet if not already done.
Before forwarding the patches I have to check they still apply onto 6.0.0, so I can draft an initial spkg on top of the one from #14692 and then you can fix whatever you want on top of it to ease the git transition and so on.


So I'll just check your spkg.

Can you rebase the branch on 6.2.beta2? I have done:

* ./sage -dev checkout --ticket 14876
* downloaded ntl-6.0.0.tar.bz2 to upstream
* tried to rebuild flint...


```
cat build/pkgs/flint/package-version.txt 
2.3.p1
```

So that branch is still on the old versions of flint, singular and eclib. I need to be able to rebuild them to fully test the ticket.

I'd say

```
git fetch --all
git checkout -b test_ntl trac/u/jpflori/ticket/14876
```

Of course, you need to be tracking everything from the track git branch for that to work.
I don't remmeber the syntac, but something like

```
git fetch trac u/jpflori/ticket/14876
git checkout -b test_ntl trac/u/jpflori/ticket/14876
```

might do the trick if you don't.

I don't know how to do that with the dev scripts, sorry :(
