Several improvements for calculating properties of polytopes that depend on the face-lattice.

Computations can be much faster when avoiding creating explicitly the face lattice.

Example:
P = polytopes.permutahedron(6)
P.f_vector()

At my machine this takes over 8s, but it should be a matter of ms. For permutahedron(7) it takes forever and should also be a matter of ms.
