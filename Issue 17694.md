Hmmm... in the gfan page, in the AUTHOR section the first sentence about Anders Nedergaard Jensen doesn't look good -- and the one about Marshall Hampton doesn't either. And in the index of the interfaces, there's a big "MISSING TITLE" for magma free.

Also, I find it strange that in the index of interfaces, 4ti2 comes with a link to the homepage of the project.

Could you also, while you're at it, modify the title about the two Rubik's cube solvers, because there are three?

Well, yes, the idea was to first include as many modules as possible and only then fix this kind of issues. But ok, since you took the pain of detailing the issues, I'll try to make things look a bit better already on this ticket. Thanks for your comments!

Well, I don't think it would be very good to review something positively only to have the result reported as bad in another ticket :-/

Hmm, what is the problem with these sentences?

The rest should be fixed by the commit I'm going to push in a minute.
