In #27061 I added a fix to `inline_fortran` to work around a problem in Numpy 1.16 with `f2py.compile`.

The problem is now [fixed upstream](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16205) with a new interface for `f2py.compile` that makes it easier to capture stdout/err from the fortran compiler.

This just means that when we upgrade to Numpy 1.20 it will be possible to remove some of the code from `inline_fortran` that essentially duplicates `f2py.compile`.
