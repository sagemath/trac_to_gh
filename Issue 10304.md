Here is some preliminary code to implement the center of the symmetric group algebras, various bases for this and related rings, and coercions between these and to/from the ring of symmetric functions.

Things that I plan to do:
* Fill in all of the TODO doctests with actual doctests.
* Figure out why some of the coercions aren't discovered by the coercion framework. (See the last few examples at the top of the file.)
* `SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenter` does not actually have a multiplicative identity as currently implemented, so it should probably by in a category other than `GradedAlgebrasWithBasis`.
* Reimplement `ConjugacyClassBasis` and `OrthogonalIdempotentBasis` for a fixed symmetric group over the integers. Then, the conversion table can be cached, the elements can be represented by lists of coefficients (possibly numpy arrays) instead of dictionaries, and faster linear algebra over the integers can be used. This results in massive (several orders of magnitude) speedups.
* Possibly add the option of saving some of the conversion tables to disk, as they can be large and expensive to compute.
* Add the relevant classes to `sage/combinat/all.py`.

Note that this depends on #7980 and #10304.

It's been a while, but my recollection is that the code works most of the time, but several doctests are missing before it's acceptable. Also the performance is not great.

To fix the problems with the code (mostly some coercions and performance issues), I think a better architecture would be needed. In particular, not using `CombinatorialFreeModule` would probably be better. We also have a better understanding of the mathematics behind the various changes of basis between symmetric functions and the Farahat-Higman algebra now, and this could be used for the code.

Thus we would need to take the terms just corresponding to partitions `n` in the larger product. Is this correct?\n\nIn the current version, the ground field `R` given to the constructor `FarahatHigmanAlgebra` is first transformed into a polynomial ring of the form `R['t']`, and then the `n` is the variable `t` from this new polynomial ring. A better design would be to pass the ring `R['t']` directly to the constructor, and let the parameter be chosen arbitrarily from this ring (not just the generator `t`). This is one of the points that made me think a better design is in order, because it creates some problems down the line.\n\nRegarding the bound on partitions based on `n`: strictly speaking, in the FH algebra, the basis includes *all* partitions, not just those where `size + length <= n`. If you want to get the center of the symmetric group algebra for a fixed integer `n`, say `n = 4`, then you need to do two things:\n\n1. Start from the Farahat-Higman algebra over `R['t']` with parameter `t`, and specialize `t` to `4`.\n\n2. Map every basis element where the partition has `size + length > 4` to zero.\n\nThe second step is where the bound on partitions comes up, but at that point it's no longer the Farahat-Higman algebra itself, but rather a homomorphic image.

Great! I'll have a look as you suggest.

Sure. In the meantime, here's the bibtex from mathscinet for the original paper by Farahat and Higman:

> - From what I could find, it seems like the Farahat-Higman algebra is actually just the parts for a fixed `n`, not allowing `n` to vary. Thus we would need to take the terms just corresponding to partitions `n` in the larger product. Is this correct?

In the current version, the ground field `R` given to the constructor `FarahatHigmanAlgebra` is first transformed into a polynomial ring of the form `R['t']`, and then the `n` is the variable `t` from this new polynomial ring. A better design would be to pass the ring `R['t']` directly to the constructor, and let the parameter be chosen arbitrarily from this ring (not just the generator `t`). This is one of the points that made me think a better design is in order, because it creates some problems down the line.

Regarding the bound on partitions based on `n`: strictly speaking, in the FH algebra, the basis includes *all* partitions, not just those where `size + length <= n`. If you want to get the center of the symmetric group algebra for a fixed integer `n`, say `n = 4`, then you need to do two things:

1. Start from the Farahat-Higman algebra over `R['t']` with parameter `t`, and specialize `t` to `4`.

2. Map every basis element where the partition has `size + length > 4` to zero.

The second step is where the bound on partitions comes up, but at that point it's no longer the Farahat-Higman algebra itself, but rather a homomorphic image. Does that make sense?

> - On line 426 of `farahat_higman.py`, you had originally left that sentence as incomplete and I couldn't figure out how to finish it. Could you finish writing that paragraph?

Hah, what I just wrote above is what I meant to write in the documentation. I think it's a very muddled and unclear explanation, though, so I should improve it. Let me know if it makes no/some/complete sense.

Good call.

> For reviewing this patch, we'll do a cross-review where I review your changes and you review mine. Sound good?

That works.

Cheers,
Mathieu

Hey Mathieu,

I think it would be best to just look at the final version, but the commit messages are helpful. A few quick comments from looking over the branch:

* The `SymmetricGroupAlgebraCenterBases` should be in the other file.
* The references should be formatted like:

```
.. [Name2013] Blah. *I prefer titles in italics when there's no
   math formatting needed*. Other stuff.
```

  Then you can reference them as `[Name2013]_` in any place in any file, i.e. they are global to all of the Sage documentation.
* It should be `.. RUBRIC::` with 2 colons and `.. SEEALSO::` as one word.

I'll make some changes if you don't beat me to them first as I start to work with the new workflow.

Best,

Travis
