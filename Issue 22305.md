The stats.mode(v) function gives result not complying to documentation when given the list
[0, 2, 7, 7, 13, 20, 2, 13].

The doctsring specifies

    Return the mode of v. The mode is the sorted list of the most
    frequently occuring elements in v. If n is the most times
    that any element occurs in v, then the mode is the sorted list
    of elements of v that occur n times.


```
sage: mode([0, 2, 7, 7, 13, 20, 2, 13])
[2,13,7]
```


This list returned in this instance is not sorted and therefore mode(v) does not meet specification.
