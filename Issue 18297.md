CC:  @fchapoton @nathanncohen vivianepons

It is more logical for a user to think "What can I do with this poset?" than "What functions are defined in this file?". This is a suggestion to add `is_selfdual` and `is_lattice` to index of functions in `posets.py`.

I believe that you should move those functions from categories files to posets files. What you say in the ticket's description is already partly wrong: the index of poset function indicates the functions defined in `FinitePoset`, but not the functions inherited from more abstract classes: I expect that you do not plan to see all poset functions if we ever have an index of functions in `lattices.py`?

Sidenote, we do have index in `lattices.py` now: #18489.

I asked about moving functions about a year ago. There was some reasons for not doing it.

I think that everyone using lattices will know that a lattice is a poset, and so can find the functions. This is totally different in this case: plain mathematical knowledge can not reveal at all that some functions are available but from another file.

(There is a real corner case: Student playing with groups may not know what is magma or semigroup. In principle there should be no `.is_abelian()` (or something like that) directly on groups. It should be inherited from magmas. But that might be a problem from documentation point of view.)

I finally have a chance to start reviewing things again.

Is there any chance you could look up the justification for keeping some poset functions in `posets.py` and some in `categories`? Because I agree that unifying them would be the better solution.

Also, why does the index of functions not make any reference to other modules that it may be inheriting functions from? Even if we can expect that (for example) a user will know that every lattice is a poset, the documentation should directly provide a link from the index of functions for Lattices to the index of functions for Posets, rather than forcing them to manually find the relevant page.

This has been discussed on sage-devel. I did not understood all of it, but in any case there will be functions in two places.

> Also, why does the index of functions not make any reference to other modules that it may be inheriting functions from?

Can be done. However, there is BIG difference here: it needs "only" mathematical knowledge to know that a lattice is a poset, but it needs knowledge of Sage internals to know that more functions may be found on categories.

But this is another story and does not belong to this patch.

Well. You say that nobody rejected it, but I am personally against the changes from two of those tickets. You are only right in the sense that I don't believe that 'not agreeing' is sufficient to 'reject it'.

By the way, you should really stop with those two-lines tickets and merge those superficial changes into something else (if you find somebody who agrees with it).

Already lowering ticket counter with #19023.

I think that the point of this ticket is not about those two lines. It is the discussion about how to enhance documentation of the software.

Move the two functions from categories to posets.py and the problem is solved. I don't see the added value of having those two lone functions in another file, where nobody will find them. Move them to `posets.py` and they can obviously be added to the doc.

We could start getting rid of those big index, and of the duplication of [1) the description of the function that follows the name of the function in the index 2) the first line of the docstring of a function] by using #18926.

Once this is done, the individual modifications do not need to be rebased as often, for the parts of code that get modified are not all located in the index: only the individual docstrings need be modified, and git has less problems with that.

The fact that #18926 is a great improvement (thanks!) does not mean that it will make documentation good. Good index is arranged by topic. And actually I have used a little different phrasing in the index compared to function.

Is "Clearly rejected" the difference between my "I don't like it, so I will not review it" and somebody else's "I don't like it, so you must not do it"?

I still don't know what there is to reject. There was a Poset class with everything inside, then somebody created a Poset category and suddenly it magically becomes "the best place" to store code, even though there is nothing in there.

I remember that it was several peoples "I don't like". And now when I check, "several" was actually "two"... They were Travis and Nicolas, and I am not sure about Nicolas. (But wait - was this discussed twice? Not sure.)

> I still don't know what there is to reject. There was a Poset class with everything inside, then somebody created a Poset category and suddenly it magically becomes "the best place" to store code, even though there is nothing in there.

I don't know. There was some explanation, of which I think I didn't understood all.

That sounds better. Lexicographic order is not always the best possible, but that's a minor thing.

I see. Well, if you ever want to move two functions back to the Poset class, just add me in Cc.

You can disable it, too.

If it makes sense, we could even update the code so that it can take as argument a list of functions "with label", group the functions according to the lablels and build the corresponding tables. Should take 10 lines at most.

It seems that majority on sage-devel are against this. See for example thread https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/rnye9oBdgKk . Hence I move this to wontfix-milestone.
