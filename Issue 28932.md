My paper with two algorithms for finding the maximal/critical angles between polyhedral convex cones was accepted:

  http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_HTML/2019/01/7048.html

I've already written these algorithms in sage, so it would be nice to add them to the library. I just need to clean up some of the documentation.

The unused import was legit (and is now fixed), but the coverage warning is for the `critical_angles` and `max_angle` functions that are wrapped by the methods of the same name in the cone class. All of the documentation (and unit tests) is on the cone methods, because that's what people will use.

(I can add some trivial tests if a happy coverage report is worth it, but so far I have avoided it as it's a complete waste of CPU time.)

More annoying, the latest patchbot reports a `Timed Out`, which is not acceptable.

- `inverse_spd`: Wouldn't that fit better into `matrix/matrix2.pyx`. This is where `cholesky` is defined.
- `_normalize_gevp_solution`: Fine.
- This error message is a full sentence.

```diff
+        ValueError: The ambient dimension must be a positive integer (there
+        are no nontrivial cones in dimension 0).
```

  I think just the part in the parenthesis would be a fine error message.

  otherwise `_random_admissible_cone` is fine
- 

```diff
+    # The standard cone containment tests don't work with normalized
+    # vectors in QQbar.
+    u_is_in_P = all( g.inner_product(u) >= 0 for g in P.dual() )
+    v_is_in_Q = all( h.inner_product(v) >= 0 for h in Q.dual() )
```

  I would propose fixing this.

```
sage: 3/2*vector([1,-1,0]) in P                                                                                                                                                     
True
sage: QQbar(2).sqrt()*vector([1,-1,0]) in P  
... # very long traceback
ValueError: Cannot coerce non-integral Algebraic Real 1.414213562373095? to Integer
```

  This is awful and inconsistent. There is no way you can convert the point `[3/2, -3/2, 0]` to be a lattice point.
  According to the documentation it should have returned `False`.
  I would propose fixing this as a dependency of this ticket:
- outsource `dual_rays` or similar from `dual`
- use `dual_rays` to improve `_contains` to behave coercion-like with your code
- then you can just compute `u in P`.
  
  If I ask whether a rational or real algebraic point is contained in a cone, I want coercion.
  
  The second thing: `all( z.inner_product(h) >= 0 for h in Q )` could then be reduced to `z in Q.dual()` (which is a bit wasteful, but not more than the current state). This could be exposed somehow as well as this is the general question whether `Q` satisfies some inequality, but that is probably not a priority.

- `gevp_licis` not fast, but if the time of running this is not relevant, it should be fine.

Me too, but I anticipate that Andrey will object. The cone module is fairly strict; if you want to do anything "dirty," you have to leave the lattice and move to your own vector space. You've probably seen this in other tickets of mine where I have to throw away the lattice structure of (say) a dual cone to be able to treat its rays as objects in the primal space. It's often annoying, but it's consistent within the cone module. And it's technically correct, even from the convex analysis/geometry perspective, so long as you use the traditional definition of "dual cone" where the elements lie in a dual vector space. So I've learned to live with it.

In either case, you are right that it should return `False` as documented.

How about `def contains(self, coerce=False)` or similar. So Andrey can have his way, but we are still not creating copies of stuff at places where they do not belong.

It's still strange that it would accept a vector but not a point in the dual lattice as input.

In a way it makes sense:

```
sage: 2 in range(2,5)

This is completely natural and I can see that you want this behavior for a cone. However, the other question should still be accessible. As you cannot change the base ring of a cone (can you?) it would be nice for the cone to provide some answer for you.

Doesn't work when the lists contain (mutable, not-hashable) vectors unfortunately. I also tried sage's `Set()` in case I had overlooked that originally but it's not checking equality element-wise.

That *still* doesn't work because

False
```

IIRC I checked the python docs for `NotImplementedError` and thought some other error would be more accurate. It's not that we've chosen not to implement this; rather, we encountered a value that we don't know how to handle while performing some other computation. If you prefer `NotImplementedError` though I don't care all that much.


> `gevp_licis` can be replaced by `sage.matroids.linear_matroid.LinearMatroid(G).independent_sets()`

Not entirely, but the latter gives a much faster implementation, thanks! I also added some docs stating that our subsets need to be ordered similarly. It's in the paper but wasn't in the code.


> Do you really need `QQbar` or is `AA` enough? 

I don't remember why I wrote it that way but I can't find a reason for `QQbar` now, so I've changed it.

I think this code would be slightly cleaner if `I` and `J` were just `frozenset`.

Should that work? I get `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'range' and 'frozenset'`.

If you meant `frozenset(range(P.nrays()))`, then that would work; still, we'd have to sort the whole thing again to make sure that `I_complement` has the same order as `I` itself (and that we can use it as a matrix index).

You don't need the `\` here:

```
            if (other.lattice_dim() != self.lattice_dim()):
                raise ValueError("lattice dimensions of self and other "\
                                 "must agree")

                                 "ambient space")
```

(The parentheses take care of it.)

No period/full-stop at the end of `INPUT:` lines.

In `_normalize_gevp_solution`, do you need to pass the full tuple? I guess this makes the code easier. If so, I would replace `irrelevant` with `ignored`.

No space around the list; e.g.:

```diff
-G_index_sets = [ s for s in gevp_licis(G) if not len(s) == n ]
+G_index_sets = [s for s in gevp_licis(G) if not len(s) == n]
```


Some of your `# long time` are misaligned compared to others in their block (it isn't a big issue, it was just visually jarring for me).
