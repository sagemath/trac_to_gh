# Issue 30926: sage-spkg: For script packages without spkg-install, run "sage -info" and exit with error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31163

Then scripts like `build/pkgs/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq/spkg-install` can be removed.

Comparing https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/actions/runs/1249185115 with https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/1231575049 shows much fewer "ERROR IN LOG FILE" annotations.

Ready for review

A small issue: running `./sage -i graphviz` prints this at the end:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make graphviz'):

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the
environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.
```

Should `sage --info ...` also write the output to a log file with an appropriate error so that it gets flagged in this message?

I don't think this would be very useful. The output already goes to `logs/install.log`


---

Also, and I'm guessing this is beyond the scope of this ticket, but on my Mac I did `brew install graphviz` and then `./configure`, and it said

```
configure:43560: result: graphviz-none:                               using system package; SPKG will not be installed
```

It would be nice if `make graphviz` said that it was already installed as a system package, rather than giving the same error message as if it weren't installed.

It also used to say:

```
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional, use "./configure --enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq" to install
```


I just made some improvements to both of these messages. I am now getting:

```
pandoc-none:                                 using system package
...
perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-none:              no suitable system package; optional
```


Also I have removed the useless configure options `--enable-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` (whose only function was to provoke an error at `make` time) -- so they are no longer shown in `./configure --help`.

This wouldn't be consistent with what `make SPKG` does for installable packages: When the system package is in use, `make SPKG` will nevertheless build the SPKG.

We unfortunately do not have make targets that would mean "make sure that SPKG exists, either as system package or a built package" -- see #31501 for this

Although it would be consistent with what we do for an installable package when the system package is not in use (or does not exist): if it's already built, `make PKG` doesn't build it again, I get "Nothing to (re)build / all up-to-date." Should we treat an uninstallable system package like that? Anyway, I agree, that's #31501.

No, I think that would be confusing

I guess `--with-system-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq` still makes sense, in particular with "force", but `--with-system-perl_cpan_polymake_prereq=no` doesn't. Not a big deal.

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2021-09-22 02:29:01

I've lost track of the flow in `Makefile.in`. Why check `-x .../spkg-install` and not check whether `spkg-install.in` exists? Are the packages with `spkg-install.in` managed elsewhere?

Script packages don't use ".in" files, see https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#install-scripts-of-script-packages

(There's also a ticket to unify this between script and normal packages. #29386)

Can we use this treatment in #31529?

I can confirm that with a vanilla 9.5.beta2 tarball + this branch, `./configure && make dist` works, while if I remove the [latest changes](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=c1bf35690044b88f2cfec4b6879c4669c138aeaf), it fails.
