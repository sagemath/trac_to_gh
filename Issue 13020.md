Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

CC:  @nathanncohen

Keywords: sparse6_string

The function compare_edges() of module 'sage.graphs.graph.py' is used only in one place, function sparse6_string(), and it works only on graphs whose vertices can be compared with the < operator, e.g. integers. Furthermore, the documentation is incomplete.

Hence, suggesting to make it a local function at the place where it is used.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13192

Okay, okay, - you are making me learn python... ;-)  I took some information from http://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting/


How about my following one liner? (included in recent patch)

```
edges.sort(key=lambda e: (e[1],e[0]))
```


This needs Python version >= 2.4 . Is this dependency okay for sage?


Otherwise, we could write

```
edges.sort(cmp=lambda e,f: cmp(e[1],f[1]) or cmp(e[0],f[0]))
```


which seems Python 3.x **incompatible** though not an issue yet.

For testing, I run

```
sage -c "for g in graphs(8): print g.sparse6_string()" > gr8-old.out
```

for all three version (old, key-version, cmp-verison) and the output was the same.


Now, how about giving up the 30 lines of compare_edges() with a good feeling?

Your update apparently added a lot of whitespace changes again.  Also, what was the doctest error?   Did you change the code at all?

I think generally in doctests we go with 

```
doctest:...: DeprecationWarning: compare
```

instead of 

```
doctest:1: DeprecationWarning: compare
```

in case things were to go in a different order.  At any rate, that's what I've seen.

My last update did *not* touch the whitespaces. In a previous update I reduced the number of changed lines from 10 to 6 lines. These trailing whitespace changes are only within the documentation of the method `sparse6_string`, which does not seem to be modified for years(?, ...according to my search on sage-trac). It reads like removing trailing whitespace is forbidden. Hence, I have moved all these changes into a separate file and you are at liberty to exclude or include them - no question asked! ;-)

Am I lying? - joke - Okay, the change was small! It added exactly the line on that you were commenting. When (restoring and) deprecating the old function I did not think about that the deprecation will affect all doctests where this functions is called. (In my case luckily only one place - the doctest of the deprecated function.)

Unfortunately, my first discovery was "doctest:1:" (and there are a few such places in the source code) and I copied that. - Now it is changed.

> Also, even if you aren't removing the function, presumably it was still testing something useful.  Would it be possible to add a graph like the kind Nathann suggests (with non-integer vertices) that shows that this new code is properly comparing, as well as showing it properly compares the edges tested before?  I agree that it's good (or at least I said I did above!), just that we want to have documentation.

The change was about sorting graph edges. Thus, I added some doctests that sort the edges once by the old method and once by the new method and compare the results. As suggested I put these doctests in the deprecated function.

> Basically, what you could do is move the tests in the old function to the tests for the actual meaningful function, and then leave only a very minimal doctest in the old function that states that this is deprecated in the docstring, and has *one* test exactly to test the deprecation warning.

I reduced the old doctests to just one. It will save a few millionths of a second for doctesting ;-) Well, in this case there was not much doctesting to remove...
