# Issue 26396: clean generic_graph.py (part 4)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26633

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2018-11-04 14:20:28

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

Done here:
- add a warning in method `allow_multiple_edges` as it may compare edge labels of different types in Python 3.
- reduce the number of sorting in `multiple_edges`
- modify a doctest in method `kruskal` of `spanning_tree.pyx` that was impacted by changes in methods about multiple edges.
- various PEP8 cleaning
