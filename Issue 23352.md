oops, sorry, I changed my mind and decided to make a mass-addition instead. Do you still say "positive review if tests pass" ?

Thanks. As bot is morally green, I am setting to positive.

Jeroen, do you agree on the idea of adding "absolute_import" to all pyx files ?

Replying to [comment:10 chapoton]:
> Jeroen, do you agree on the idea of adding "absolute_import" to all pyx files ?

1. If you want to do that, why not _all_ files (both `.pyx` and `.py`)?

2. If you want to do that, why not add `division, print_function` everywhere too?
