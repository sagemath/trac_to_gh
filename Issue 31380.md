This is a follow-up of #30804. This ticket provides:

- a global frame of S^3
- Hopf coordinates
- Lie group structure (?)

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.

Just a reminder of some notebooks which might serve as starting points for this project:
- Hopf coordinates: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S3_Hopf.ipynb
- Lie group structure: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S3_vectors.ipynb
- Riemannian structure: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_sphere_S3_metric.ipynb

Also, regarding Lie groups in Sage, at the moment, we have only nilpotent Lie groups (cf. https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/lie_gps/nilpotent_lie_group.html), which have been implemented through #26344.
