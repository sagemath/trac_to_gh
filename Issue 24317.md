While other orthogonal polynomial functions (as well as almost all other symbolic functions) are simply `BuiltinFunction`s or `GinacFunction`s this ticket suffers from the fact that the Cheby functions in Sage allow the `algorithm` keyword (by using a `__call__` method in the superclass). The way such polymorphisms are resolved in other functions is by having the interface (the callable global function `chebyshev_T()`) dispatching on the keyword.

The usage `chebyshev_T(...algorithm='pari'` silently uses normal evaluation because there is no `_eval_pari_` member, so Pari was never supported.
