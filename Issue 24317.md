# Issue 24317: Remove __call__() usage in Chebyshev functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24554

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2018-01-17 08:27:05

While other orthogonal polynomial functions (as well as almost all other symbolic functions) are simply `BuiltinFunction`s or `GinacFunction`s this ticket suffers from the fact that the Cheby functions in Sage allow the `algorithm` keyword (by using a `__call__` method in the superclass). The way such polymorphisms are resolved in other functions is by having the interface (the callable global function `chebyshev_T()`) dispatching on the keyword.

The usage `chebyshev_T(...algorithm='pari'` silently uses normal evaluation because there is no `_eval_pari_` member, so Pari was never supported.

Also the usage `chebyshev_T(...algorithm='maxima')` used normal evaluation. Maxima returns a polynomial in `(x-1)` which probably is useful so I'm changing doctests. In a later step this could be renamed to a more descriptive name and computed by Sage.

Also `eval_formula()` should become `algorithm='hypergeometric'`. The Maxima "algorithm" is variant of it, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials#Explicit_expressions

Docs fail to build, doctest errors in three files:
 * `sage -t --long src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 6 doctests failed`
 * `sage -t --long src/sage/rings/number_field/splitting_field.py  # 2 doctests failed`
 * `sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.py  # 1 doctest failed`
