I propose to deal with this in #20192 instead.

In any case, if you want the fix to be applied, you need to increase the Cython version number.

I would like to add a doctest for that. Do you think that the following is strong enough

```
sage: p = polygen(ZZ)
sage: import resource 
sage: mem0 = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss 
sage: for _ in range(10000):
....:     t = Polynomial.__call__(p, 1)
sage: assert resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss < mem0 + 1000
```

If not, do you have a better idea?
