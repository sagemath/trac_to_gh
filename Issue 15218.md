No, concurrent workers are not interrupted. Especially PDF build errors are typically sandwiched between 1000's of lines of unrelated output.

I'm not sure I would want concurrent workers interrupted, at least for html docs. If `reference/combinat` is 90% done and going to build correctly and the error is somewhere else, I want to be able to try to fix the error and then not have to wait for `combinat` to build again from scratch.

This might be more useful for the PDF docs, since I don't think the docbuilder does a good job of detecting whether the docs have been successfully built already.

Of course the annoyance factor depends on how much the concurrent jobs spew out. In a makefile, gcc will only add a line or so which is negligible. But you really want to see the error within the last ~50 lines, everything else is imho very confusing.

Fortunately, the PDF build is logged. If the PDF build fails, maybe we could get better error-reporting: report, for example, if there is a (recent?) LaTeX file in `output/latex/en/reference/MODULE/` but no PDF file in `output/pdf/en/reference/MODULE/`. Or switch to a serial build to isolate the problem.

Comparing with `make`, I don't want `make` to interrupt concurrent workers, so I don't think I want docbuilding to do this, either.
