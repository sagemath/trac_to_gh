Interrupt documentation building if an error is encountered. Aso, search output for more error conditions (equivalent to Jeroen's release manager script).

Isn't this already happening?

No, concurrent workers are not interrupted. Especially PDF build errors are typically sandwiched between 1000's of lines of unrelated output.

I'm not sure I would want concurrent workers interrupted, at least for html docs. If `reference/combinat` is 90% done and going to build correctly and the error is somewhere else, I want to be able to try to fix the error and then not have to wait for `combinat` to build again from scratch.

This might be more useful for the PDF docs, since I don't think the docbuilder does a good job of detecting whether the docs have been successfully built already.

Of course the annoyance factor depends on how much the concurrent jobs spew out. In a makefile, gcc will only add a line or so which is negligible. But you really want to see the error within the last ~50 lines, everything else is imho very confusing. The thousands of lines of PDF output easily flood the scrollback buffer, that I'd call a total disaster.

Fortunately, the PDF build is logged. If the PDF build fails, maybe we could get better error-reporting: report, for example, if there is a (recent?) LaTeX file in `output/latex/en/reference/MODULE/` but no PDF file in `output/pdf/en/reference/MODULE/`. Or switch to a serial build to isolate the problem.

Comparing with `make`, I don't want `make` to interrupt concurrent workers, so I don't think I want docbuilding to do this, either.

Its a recurring pain point that people fail to find the errors in their PDF file, but I guess it just hurts to be stupid.

Huh? I thought you disagreed with closing this?
