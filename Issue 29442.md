# Issue 29442: Cleanup of 28757

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29679

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2020-05-12 15:37:01

CC:  jipilab

Keywords: combinatorial polyhedron

This is a cleanup of #28757.

I forgot to remove the redundant file `src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/bit_vector_operations.pxd`.

There is also the wrong description for intersection in `polyhedron_face_lattice.pyx`.
