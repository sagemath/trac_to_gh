This is a follow-up on #22497.

This gives an error -- because LattE forgets to print the answer on stdout in this particular case.

```
        sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0,0]])
        sage: cddin = P.cdd_Hrepresentation()
        sage: count(cddin, cdd=True, raw_output=False)  # optional - latte_int
```
