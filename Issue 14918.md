CC:  simonking jkeitel novoselt

The unpickling of `UniqueRepresentation` is fragile, and we keep tripping over that at #15050,  #15149.

I claim that the issue is a fundamental problem: To decide uniqueness, you need the complete object. It is **in principle impossible** to decide whether to use an already-constructed isomorphic object without reconstructing the complete object first. But, as soon as cyclic references are used, you cannot avoid incompletely reconstructed objects during the unpickling process.

As a minimal example, consider

```python
    class Bar(UniqueRepresentation):
        def __init__(self, foo):
            self.foo = foo

    class Foo(object):
        def __init__(self, i):
            self.i = i
            self.bar = Bar(self)
        
        def __hash__(self):
            return self.i
```


Now instances cannot be unpickled, because the hash cannot be evaluated without filling in `self.i` first:


```

sage: loads(dumps(a))

```

Note that its not really a problem about computing the hash; One could use a different hash function but then the same problem would arise when comparing incomplete objects: You need to know `self.i` to compare instances, that is, to decide whether they should be taken from the `UniqueRepresentation` cache.

The problem lies in the way in which Python pickles by default (namely: Create a new instance and fill its `__dict__`). This problem will always hunt you, and I experienced similar problems with homsets, if the following issues come together.
- You have a Python object `OPy`whose pickling is via `__new__` and filling `__dict__`
- `OPy` has an attribute which uses `OPy` as key (in your example, this attribute is the `UniqueRepresentation` which uses `self` as key).

I understand from comment:2 that you used a drastical solution in #15050: empty the cache. I think it would be better to provide `OPy` with a `__reduce__` method.

__Example__

Here is an example that shows that `UniqueRepresentation` is not to blame:

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self, i):
....:         self.i = i
....:         self.bar = {1:2, self:3}
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return int(self.i)
....:     
sage: f = Foo(2)
sage: loads(dumps(f))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-7cad277c698c> in <module>()
----> 1 loads(dumps(f))

/mnt/local/king/SAGE/GIT/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/structure/sage_object.so in sage.structure.sage_object.loads (sage/structure/sage_object.c:11044)()

<ipython-input-1-4e7295304e31> in __hash__(self)
      4         self.bar = {Integer(1):Integer(2), self:Integer(3)}
      5     def __hash__(self):
----> 6         return int(self.i)
      7 

AttributeError: 'Foo' object has no attribute 'i'
sage: hash(f)
2
```


And here is how to fix it:

```
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self, i):
....:         self.i = i
....:         self.bar = {1:2, self:3}
....:     def __hash__(self):
....:         return int(self.i)
....:     def __reduce__(self):
....:         return Foo, (self.i,)
....:     
sage: f = Foo(2)
sage: loads(dumps(f))
<__main__.Foo at 0x57f6c10>
```

So basically you are saying to never pickle UniqueRepresentation with cyclic references. Certainly fixes the error, but basically means that we give up on pickling in general (aka. the option number one in the ticket description).

It is not a good option for the toric varieties code, as it would mean to manually recreate the input for the toric variety to reduce the CohomologyRing class. It could be automated by rewriting `UniqueRepresentation.__reduce__` using `sage_input()`. Of course then every class that derives from UniqueRepresentation must implement `_sage_input_` to be serializable.

The problem is not in how Python unpickles, I would claim that it is a fundamental disconnect between serialization (in the presence of cyclic references) and making objects unique. You just can't achieve both aims in a single pass, no matter how you implement it.

Isn't it that pickling circular references in general needs a little care? I think the issue may be that `UniqueRepresentation` by itself is basically already a (global) cache, so combined with caches stored on the objects, circularity will be increased.

I may be wrong, but isn't it the case on #15050 that circularity arises because a toric variety caches its cohomology ring and the cohomology ring (being derived from the toric variety) refers back to the toric variety?

`UniqueRepresentation` means that a toric variety wouldn't HAVE to refer to its cohomology ring, since a freshly created cohomology ring will be looked up to be the same one anyway.

It may be the case that caching the cohomology ring on the toric variety explicitly is still desirable to avoid the penalty of using UniqueRepresentation, but that cache is then of a very different type than normal and it would be the kind of cache that doesn't need to be pickled.

It may also be that computing the cohomology ring from scratch is a very expensive operation, so that it is desirable to pickle the cohomology ring. However, in that case, perhaps someone should do that explicitly. The corollary would be that the toric variety gets pickled too.

It may seem a bit of a pain at first to have to think about avoiding circularities (i.e., in this case trying to enforce that the toric variety doesn't refer explicitly to its cohomology ring) and I don't hava a proof that you can always avoid circularity, but the fact that mathematics tries to avoid circularity in its definitions, suggests we could go a long way in that direction.

It's not just pickling that has problems with circularity: The garbage collector also has trouble with it (**EDIT:** I mean a mild kind of *trouble* here. Nothing fatal). I think it's worth it to try and avoid circularity when possible and perhaps, when it's really necessary, take some care breaking it in select places before pickling.

Note that we also don't pickle discovered coercion graphs. Trying to do so would certainly spell disaster.

There is no problem with pickling arbitrarily complicated objects involving cyclic references, as far as I know cPickle can handle that in all cases. This ticket is about the inability (at least right now) to do so if you also want to enforce uniqueness, and what can be done about it.

I suspect the key might lie in the fact that the pickle machinery DOES allow for a second pass: Reduce allows returning a tuple of length at most 5: `(constructor,args,state,append_iterator,setitem_iterator)`
which instructs the unpickle machine to execute roughly the following

```
obj = constructor(*args)
obj.__setstate__(state)
for a in append_iterator:
    obj.append(a)
for key,value in setitem_iterator:
    obj[key]=value
```

(the last two entries, `append_iterator` and `setitem_iterator` are just there for convenience: their functionality could be obtained from an appropriate `__setstate__`)

The key here is that circularity and recursive loops are only a problem for things included in `args`. In the later phases, `obj` already exists as a functional python object; its state might not be the final, desired one yet.

Things like caches are originally created by modifying the object after it already exists, so if we pickle caches, we should do so in a way that they get recreated during `setstate`, not as part of `args`.

So I don't think there is a fundamental obstruction to pickling arbitrarily circular data structures. You just have to make sure that the circularity gets inserted at the `setstate` phase. In reality, this just reflects how the circularity was obtained in the data structure to begin with!

I haven't found the smoking gun yet, but it seems to me that if presently pickling can get ruined due to cached information, it's because `__cached_methods` is being populated in construction, not in `setstate`.

In the example in the description of the ticket, one solution would be to move the initialization of `self.bar` needs to be relegated to `__setstate__`. That, or provide a custom `__reduce__` that reproduces the exact `Foo(...)` call, because that ensures the `i` is present before `Bar` is used, so that `__hash__` works.

I disagree.

We talk here about unpickling a Python object O that has an attribute A whose construction relies on the hash of O. If I understand correctly how Python's default way of pickling works, `args` is empty (since there is no `__initargs__` method). Instead, a new instance of `O.__class__` is created *without* calling `__init__`, and A is passed in `state` (not in `args`) and is used to fill the new instance's `__dict__`.

>  In the later phases, `obj` already exists as a functional python object; its state might not be the final, desired one yet.

Not the way Python's default pickling works! This is what I tried to say in comment:3: You need to implement pickling for `O.__class__`, by a `__reduce__` method, or perhaps an `__initargs__` would work as well, because then (as you say) the object *would* exist as a functional python object before filling its `__dict__`.

> So I don't think there is a fundamental obstruction to pickling arbitrarily circular data structures. You just have to make sure that the circularity gets inserted at the `setstate` phase.

Sure. "You have to make sure...", which means "you must implement pickling, as you can't rely on Python's default way of serialisation".

> I haven't found the smoking gun yet, but it seems to me that if presently pickling can get ruined due to cached information, it's because `__cached_methods` is being populated in construction, not in `setstate`.

The example in comment:3 has already shown that `__cached_methods` is not relevant.

Exactly.

OK, my remark is not quite relevant for this ticket. I was more thinking of problems a la #15156.

What we see on both tickets is that doing too much/too little at construction/setstate time leads to pickling problems.

It also seems that some of the code presently in sage does not take very much care in handling this.

So the lesson still stands: In the face of pickling problems, pay attention to your construction/setstate balance. I think that's a useful one for people having to provide their own reduction methods, and for the near future, people should probably watch out that the problems may well lie in existing code, not just their own additions.
