I would like to have better line coverage reports for Sage's doctests.  There are a few hurdles to this simply due to Sage's custom test runner, and the sheer size of Sage, but nothing that can't be overcome.  My initial testing just with [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.5.1/)'s command-line interface has shown some reasonable results (by running tests with `--serial`.

`coverage.py` does support parallel tests--it has built-in support for writing coverage results to per-process files, and then merging those files.  The [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/blob/master/src/pytest_cov/engine.py) plugin, which supports this use case, may provide some valuable guidance on this.

Report so far:  I was able to integrate `coverage.py` into Sage's doctest runner using its API--that aspect was reasonably easy, though not perfect.  The ugliest part is outputting thousands of per-module coverage files for the parallel tests, and then merging them into a single `.coverage` file.  `coverage.py` provides this ability built-in, but I'm not totally happy with how it works.

The other problem is that Cython's plugin for coverage.py is not perfect--this is no surprise, as it probably doesn't get used much, and Sage is a massive stress-test of it.  For one, in order for it to work at all, I had to copy all of the c/cpp files into site-packages.

Finally, while most of the tests ran just fine under profiling, about a dozen just outright timed out.  I have a few ideas for speeding up line profiling in Cython, but I'm not sure how much of a difference it will make.

Replying to [comment:4 embray]:
> In particular it omits the `def` lines for all functions and methods, even those that are definitely run.

Looking more at the coverage report, I'm seeing this problem even on pure Python modules, so maybe it's less a problem with the tracing than with reporting.   I've never seen this problem before on pure-Python code coverage (and I confirmed even with the same version of coverage.py I don't see this problem normally).  

The Cython plugin really shouldn't be handling pure-Python modules at all, but it might be that the Cython plugin is still interfering somehow.

`def` and `class` statements in some modules aren't being tracked because *those* line are executed at module level as well, so any module-level code not being traced is the same problem, of course.

I've also found now that it's not a problem in all pure-Python modules, just some (and AFAICT in *all* Cython modules).

At least for a trivial example I tried line tracing worked for a Cython module just fine, including all module-level statements.

Given that this appears to be affecting Cython and Python modules alike, my next guess it that it has something to do with `LazyImport`...
