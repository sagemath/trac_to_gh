The reports that installing `latte_int` will set the machine on fire are greatly exaggerated.
Therefore the package type should be changed from experimental to optional.
Hopefully, the package can then also be made available on SMC.

Did any of you run full doctests (i.e. `make ptestlong`) with this branch applied and `latte_int` installed?

See #18563 where `latte_int` was changed from optional to experimental.

I did 

```
sage -tp --long --optional=4ti2,atlas,ccache,database_gap,gap_packages,mpir,python2,latte_int,sage src/sage/geometry/
```

which is good enough, as `latte_int` is not used elsewhere
