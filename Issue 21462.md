The reports that installing `latte_int` will set the machine on fire are greatly exaggerated.
Therefore the package type should be changed from experimental to optional.
Hopefully, the package can then also be made available on SMC.

I did 

```
sage -tp --long --optional=4ti2,atlas,ccache,database_gap,gap_packages,mpir,python2,latte_int,sage src/sage/geometry/
```
which is good enough, as `latte_int` is not used elsewhere
