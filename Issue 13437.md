Keywords: representation of morphism

A small patch implementing a function _short_repr which returns a short representation of a morphism.
(The representation is `e_1 |--> f_1, ..., e_n |-> f_n` where $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ is a generating family of the source.)

This function is used in #13215

Few minor things:
- You need 2 colons for examples -> `EXAMPLES::`
- I'd like this as a public method, i.e. name it `short_repr()`. If you'd prefer to keep this private, please name it `_repr_short()`.
- Add a second example with multiple generators.
- Add examples of the form (or do all examples in this form):
  {{{
  sage: print f.short_repr()
  }}}
  which will show the actual output of the string.
- I'd like a blank line between the documentation and the `EXAMPLES::` block.
- You'll need to put in your real name for the ticket.

Thanks,

Travis

Hmm...based on what's already in sage and that it is a variant on `_repr_`, I'd call it `_repr_short()` (akin to `_repr_defn()`).

Personally I don't like hiding alternative outputs, but that's an issue for another time.

Thanks,

Travis
