Why are you _renaming_ the patch file?

Replying to [comment:5 jdemeyer]:

Apparently, i moved file one directory lower for testing, and then i was confusing with `git rm`, thanks for noticing !

This patch does not apply and i did not find the corresponding lines in the current sources, so perhaps this is fixed upstream. It is a cygwin-related patch, so let me add Erik in copy.

There is an issue with `r` interface, which seems fixed if i apply #22682.

I haven't explicitly tried it, but I don't think that patch is needed for Cygwin, which has sigsetjmp, etc.

I don't care much anyways since I'm making good progress on getting Sage to use more system packages by default, and while I haven't added readline yet it's an obvious high priority candidate.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Outdated - readline was updated to 8.0 in #30603.
