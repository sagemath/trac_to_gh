Just a few remarks:
- the documentation says it's in `\RR^n` but the result is in `ZZ`
- use `enumerate(self)` instead of `enumerate(self.vertices()` to avoid sorting vertices
- Are these methods valid for both graphs and digraphs ? if only for graphs, then move them in `graph.py`

They are valid for both graphs and digraphs. The direction is completely ignored as everything is symmetric (also for the not symmetric edge polytope, its just the polytope that is less symmetric, not the construction.

Very tiny things:
