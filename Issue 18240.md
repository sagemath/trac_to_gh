By updating Sage's shipped version of git_trac, we make it possible to checkout tickets without having a trac account.

The tarball is missing a top-level directory (usually called `src` in Sage).

Arg, sorry for that. I built it with "git archive" but it was not such a good idea after all. Will be fixed in a second.

I would be even better if `git trac checkout ...` would _automatically_ run `git trac config` if needed, but this is already nice.

Well. In terms of 'clean code', what would you think of a way to decorate functions which use a remote? The decorator would check that the remotes exist, and if they do not create them before running the function? Or do you think that it's 'oversolving' the problem?

I think that's a good solution. Just make sure that the "ensure that the `trac` remote exists" function is cached, in case a scripts needs to call those functions many times.

But really, this is Volker's code, so it's better to ask him.

I trust your sense of 'cleanness' more than I trust mine on those matters.

Yes of course.
