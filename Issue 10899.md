# Issue 10899: Resultant for polynomials over RDF and CDF not implemented

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: polynomial, resultant

Calling the resultant method for a polynomial defined over RDF or CDF returns a NotImplementedError. It would appear that this results from it not being implemented in Singular. 


```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(CDF)
sage: f = R(1 - I*x + (0.5)*x^2 + (1.7)*x^3)
sage: g = f.derivative()
sage: f.resultant(g)

I think I've tracked down the issue after some digging. From rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py/, class Polynomial_singular_repr:
"Due to the incompatibility of Python extension classes and multiple inheritance, this just defers to module-level functions."

This appears to be a Cython multiple inheritance issue - polynomials over RDF and CDF are examples of the Polynomial_generic_field, which are subclasses of Polynomial_singular_repr. The .resultant() method there fails for these objects but the .resultant() method of the Polynomial parent class (which does work) gets skipped overdue to the multiple inheritance issue.

As such, this should be fixed in an upcoming version of Cython.

Replying to [comment:1 spice]:

The issue is unchanged 3 years later.

I confirm the duplication, and the described behavior changed after #2693.
