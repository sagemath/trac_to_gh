+1 to uniformly drawing posets with the top on top. This has annoyed
me as well.

For LaTeX / PDF output, this is taken care of by the `backward` option
of `set_latex_options` in `Poset.hasse_diagram` (called by
`Poset._latex_`).

For plots, `Poset.plot` calls `Graph.plot` on the hasse diagram, and
passes it by default the `layout=acyclic` option. The layout is then
computed by `Graph.layout_acyclic` which in turn either calls
`Graph.layout_acyclic_dummy` or `Graph.layout_graphviz` if `dot2tex`
is available.

It turns out that `Graph.layout_acyclic_dummy` orients edges pointing
up, while, `Graph.layout_graphviz` uses the default behaviour of
graphviz, namely to have edges pointing down. Hence the varying
behaviour.


Soo ... what's the cleanest way out?

One strategy:

- have an option in graphs stating whether the preferred acyclic
  layout is going up or down (a generalization of the `backward` trick
  in `set_latex_option`)

- make sure both `layout_acyclic_dummy` and `layout_graphviz` honor
  this option.

- configure this option appropriately in the construction of the Hasse
  diagram.

Another strategy would be to set as default for all graphs that the
acyclic layout shall be going up. That's simpler. But not consistent
with graphviz. It also also a larger change for the users (but only
those using acyclic layout and having dot2tex installed).


What do you think?

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

Or is the problem that graphviz/dot2tex can't plot the top element on top?

Storing a plotting option in the graph? Why on earth would you do that? `O_o`

Why can't you just make the default be to plot the top element on top, and only do something different if some guy calls `my_poset.show(mess_up_top_and_bottom=True)` ?

So that when you create a hasse diagram, and later plot it, it remembers to plot it going up. But I can live without this feature.

> Why can't you just make the default be to plot the top element on top, and only do something different if some guy calls `my_poset.show(mess_up_top_and_bottom=True)` ?

That is not the question. The goal is to always plot the poset with top on top.

But to plot a poset we need to plot a digraph. So either it's ok if the acyclic layout of graphs always points up. Or we need to have an option (of the graph, or just of Graph.plot) to specify whether the acyclic layout goes up or down.

It is the default behaviour in Sage. If it is messed up when dot2tex gets installed then let *this* be fixed, and let us move on.

They chose that an arrow `a->b` meant that "a is larger than b" and `Posets` do the opposite. I do not think that it is worth more consideration than that.
