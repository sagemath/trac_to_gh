In the function `bell_number`, we have the line

```
return ZZ(ceil(N((b - n) / n2 * exp2(Integer(-1)) - 1 / 4, log(b, 2) + 3)))
```


This can be improved by
1. Removing the `1 / 4` which is actually `0` in Python 2.
2. Not using global functions like `ceil()` and `exp()`.
3. Using a `RealField` instead of the `N()` function.
