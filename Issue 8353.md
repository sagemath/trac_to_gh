# Issue 8353: Adding height() and width() functions to square grid paths

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: abmasse

Original creation time: 2010-02-24 22:34:23

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  slabbe sage-combinat

Keywords: paths, height, width

When dealing with word paths on the square grid, it is very useful to know their height and their width.

In particular, one can compute a bounding box for display purposes. This small ticket adds those two functionalities.

I would suggest that the value be converted to RR before taking the max or min. You could add a comment explaining the reason of the conversion and that this bug is trac at a ticket number that you give.

The description of this ticket is not really the good place to put your comment. You can put it in a comment of the ticket instead or on sage-devel. I asked the question on sage-devel :

Thanks for your comments !

I found an almost-clean solution for the problem raised by the triangular grid paths. Instead of computing directly the `height()` and `width()` functions, I introduced the `xmin()`, `xmax()`, `ymin()` and `ymax()` functions we talked about. They are called by the two first functions. To solve the problem for the triangular grid paths, I just redefined them by coercing the x- and y-coordinates to real values, so that the `max` and `min` functions be well-defined.

I'll upload another patch in a few minutes. Needs review !

All tests passed in sage/combinat/words. Documentation builds fine. The issue discussed above is fixed. I am giving a positive review to Alex's changes.

I added a small patch fixing some documentation. If Alexandre agrees with the changes I did, I allow him to change the status of the ticket to positive review.

I agree with SÃ©bastien's changes. I retested it just to make sure, and I looked at the documentation, which is still fine. I'll set this ticket to "positive review".
