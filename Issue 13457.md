Assignee: roed

Currently, the accuracy of the matrix returned by `matrix_mod_pn()` in padic extension rings is probably too small:

```
sage: R=ZpCA(3,5)
sage: S.<a> = R[]
sage: L.<a>=R.extension(a^2-3)
sage: t=a.add_bigoh(2)
sage: t.matrix_mod_pn()
[0 1]
[0 0]
sage: (t*a)._ntl_rep_abs() # but t*a is not zero
([3], 0)
```


I think it would be better to return the following:

```
[0 1]
[3 0]
```


Of course, the "1" is not known to precision `O(3^2)` but I think it is better to leave it to the caller to strip away the digits that are not wanted.

The attached patch increases the precision to the maximal precision of any of the entries of the matrix.
