Currently, `SAGE_DEBUG` is documented as 

```
If it is unset (the default) or set to “yes”, then debugging is turned on.
```

This is fine if you just add `gcc -g`, but the utility of having a real Python debug build shows that there should be more to debugging than just adding symbols. However, this has a real performance impact and should not be the default. So I propose that `SAGE_DEBUG` have three possible values:
* `SAGE_DEBUG=no` means no debugging symbols (no `gcc -g`), which mostly saves disk space.
* `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` builds debug versions if possible (in particular, Python and Singular). These will be notable slower.
* Anything else (including unset `SAGE_DEBUG`) is the same as the old default, compile with debugging symbols but no debugging options that influence performance.

Ah, 'anything else' sounds like a great 3rd case.

Is there any standard on whether "yes/no", "!Yes/No", "true/false", "on/off" etc. is preferred? I always end up having to google the environment variables and then hope and check later that the value I used had the desired effect.

Well, the documentation is certainly wrong (or not up-to-date), as the default is actually rather **no**.  (We decided to *add debug symbols* by default since that doesn't have a performance impact -- except for larger files and hence probably slower start-up/loading, but one can strip these symbols later.  `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` in contrast does -- depending on the spkg -- e.g. disable optimization, add extra code [probably with some runtime overhead] , so at least *may* have a major performance impact.)




W.r.t. the component:  I just meant changing the meaning certainly extends to more than a documentation change (cf. the ticket's title; otherwise I'd call it "Clarify SAGE_DEBUG", say).

Actually, what you propose is IMHO what we already have (or *should<sup>TM</sup> have*)... ;-)

So just correcting or clarifying the documentation may indeed be sufficient. :-)  (But I'd then change the ticket's title, as mentioned.)

Oh.  I thought it was at least in some `spkg-install`template.

There used to be `sage [-]-strip`, but that got removed at some point because it did more than just stripping debug symbols (which also failed on some -- presumably MacOS X -- systems) IIRC.

(We now -- or still -- have the "micro-release" `make` target though, see also `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-micro_release`...)
