# Issue 13661: Make SAGE_DEBUG three-state

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13865

Original creator: vbraun

Currently, `SAGE_DEBUG` is documented as 

```
If it is unset (the default) or set to “yes”, then debugging is turned on.
```

This is fine if you just add `gcc -g`, but the utility of having a real Python debug build shows that there should be more to debugging than just adding symbols. However, this has a real performance impact and should not be the default. So I propose that `SAGE_DEBUG` have three possible values:
  * `SAGE_DEBUG=no` means no debugging symbols (no `gcc -g`), which mostly saves disk space.
  * `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` builds debug versions if possible (in particular, Python and Singular). These will be notable slower.
  * Anything else (including unset `SAGE_DEBUG`) is the same as the old default, compile with debugging symbols but no debugging options that influence performance.

I've posted to sage-devel since this might be of interest to a larger audience: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/Lmo6mmDylj4/discussion

Ah, 'anything else' sounds like a great 3rd case.

Is there any standard on whether "yes/no", "!Yes/No", "true/false", "on/off" etc. is preferred? I always end up having to google the environment variables and then hope and check later that the value I used had the desired effect.

I think all documented environment variables use yes/no for a binary setting. In Python we always use !True/False since those are Python bools.

Component: Documentation?

You want to file it under something else? It is just a doc patch.

Is this ticket about fixing documentation of `SAGE_DEBUG`, or is it about proper behaviour/use of `SAGE_DEBUG`? If it is the latter, then I suggest one should also raise the singular-spkg from #13731 to a new patch level and replace/add the environment variable `SINGULAR_XALLOC` by `SAGE_DEBUG`.

I intended it just as a discussion and fix for the docstring. But if you want to add a new singular spkg then thats fine with me, too.

Well, the documentation is certainly wrong (or not up-to-date), as the default is actually rather *no*.  (We decided to _add debug symbols_ by default since that doesn't have a performance impact -- except for larger files and hence probably slower start-up/loading, but one can strip these symbols later.  `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` in contrast does -- depending on the spkg -- e.g. disable optimization, add extra code [probably with some runtime overhead] , so at least _may_ have a major performance impact.)




W.r.t. the component:  I just meant changing the meaning certainly extends to more than a documentation change (cf. the ticket's title; otherwise I'd call it "Clarify SAGE_DEBUG", say).

Actually, what you propose is IMHO what we already have (or _should<sup>TM</sup> have_)... ;-)

So just correcting or clarifying the documentation may indeed be sufficient. :-)  (But I'd then change the ticket's title, as mentioned.)

Ok...

`s/notable/notably/`

`s/to pinpoint/to e.g. pinpoint/`

Not sure whether the Sage Developer's Guide (on spkgs) is up-to-date right now.


---

Comment by leif created at 2012-12-26 19:40:24

We should probably also mention that (or how) debug symbols can be stripped afterwards...


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2012-12-26 19:50:15

Fixed. I grepped the docs and this is the only place that mentions `SAGE_DEBUG`. No idea how to strip besides doing it yourself, and that definitely shouldn't be covered in the install guide.

Oh.  I thought it was at least in some `spkg-install`template.

There used to be `sage [-]-strip`, but that got removed at some point because it did more than just stripping debug symbols (which also failed on some -- presumably MacOS X -- systems) IIRC.

(We now -- or still -- have the "micro-release" `make` target though, see also `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-micro_release`...)

The patch needs a proper commit message.

Fine for me. Actually changing packages to be consistent with this documentation should be done in separate tickets.
