Patch implements solving a linear system of equations in the most naive way possible, just augmenting the matrix and row-reducing.

For fields like `ZZ`, `QQ`, and integers mod p, this can be 3% to 10% faster.  For fields that use echelon form to get rank, this can be twice as fast since we only row-reduce once, not twice.  Matrices full of integers mod p can be a toss-up as the number of columns in the constant matrix is about 10 times greater than for the coefficient matrix.

Timings below and script that produced them is attached.

This has the old doctests, which pass with the new method (except two trivial failures).  Old method is included as `solve_left_old()` for ease of testing timings.  This is fully functional, but will need just a bit more work to be ready, so this is up for comments and suggestions at the moment.

For QQ and other infinite exact fields, naive Gauss elimination is not a good strategy all together, as it can lead to an exponential blowup of coefficients.

Hi Dima!

Agreed.  This is part of the challenge in testing this.  But I believe this is the current strategy.  In other words, eventually Sage does echelon form, with or without this patch.

QQ gets converted to ZZ, and I do not know if the routines over ZZ control for this.  But when I test with matrices containing number fields (cyclotomics), the rational coefficients do get out of hand.

So this patch is an incremental improvement.  With or without, we still rely on Gaussian elimination in 100% of cases (or nearly so).
