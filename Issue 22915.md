The `sage:` blocks were not indented correctly, and the math was not wrapped in single backticks (to use LaTeX style rendering.)
Edouard or Dean, if you do not object to my changes, feel free to set this back to positive review.

I also took out the INPUT/OUTPUT blocks. They do not add anything that is not stated elsewhere already, so it's probably better to just leave them out. Feel free to put them back in, if you want them in.

I just realized that #16564 also introduces this. The implementation there is more general and apparently you need to normalize the defining polynomial to get this right?

Sorry for the noise. Your implementation is fine. I adapted mine to not do the normalization.
