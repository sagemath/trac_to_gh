# Issue 16329: Improve printing of function field morphisms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Function field morphisms currently implement their own `_repr_` method for printing. This ticket makes them use the generic implementation of maps.

It might just be my personal point of view, but I do not like the compressed way that function field morphisms use for printing. The fact that they do not show their domain and codomain is sometimes annoying; imho they should simply look like most other morphisms in Sage. This is what my patch attempts to achieve.
