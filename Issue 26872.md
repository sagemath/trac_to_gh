CC:  @strogdon @fchapoton @jdemeyer

The problem is it unconditionally appends the output of GCC's `-print-multi-os-directory` flag to the install location, whereas when installing in `$SAGE_LOCAL` we just always want `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

This is already [fixed upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi/commit/877ea9bf9ac2c98cb858c12f5a6aeeec13cf978f#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408a) (quite some time ago in fact) so we just need to include that patch.

I'm actually not sure why we're using such an old version.  Maybe just because it's the version that used to be vendored with CPython.

In the meantime it may also work to install your distro's libffi-devel package and re-run Sage's `./configure`.

No, it's because there hasn't been a release of libffi since 2014! There is a "libffi 3.3 Release Candidate 0" though: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/releases

Is there potentially something else that is at issue? Sage tries to build `libffi` on my Gentoo box where it fails. I have had `libffi-3.2.1` installed on the Gentoo box for over a year. I do not really need to install `libffi` under Sage. So something did not find my installed `libffi` and tries to install it under Sage. Is a `./configure` necessary?

I believe the `configure` step is not correct. In `config.log` on Gentoo

```
configure:9080: g++ -o conftest -g -O2  -I/usr/include -I/usr/include  -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib conftest.cpp -lffi  -lz -lm  >&5

```

So the headers cannot be found even though they are installed, but in sort of an `odd` location.

So even after running `./configure` I see

```
configure: === checking whether to install the libffi SPKG ===
checking for library containing ffi_call... -lffi
checking ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi.h... no
checking ffi/ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi/ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi/ffi.h... no
```

Since the headers are in a `non-standard` location they are not found. This `non-standard` location is where the `libffi` package installs the headers by default.

I'm seeing current build failures related to libffi on "OpenSuse Leap 15.0":

```
[libffi-3.2.1] Copying package files from temporary location /waste/jenkins/local/var/tmp/sage/build/libffi-3.2.1/inst to /waste/jenkins/local
[libffi-3.2.1] cp: cannot overwrite non-directory '/waste/jenkins/local/./lib64' with directory '/waste/jenkins/local/var/tmp/sage/build/libffi-3.2.1/inst/waste/jenkins/local/./lib64'
```

Here the "/waste/jenkins/local/./lib64" is a symbolic link to "lib", so I do not really understand the error message:

```

I don't like how this ticket is turning from "fix this one specific libffi install issue blocking installation of Sage" to "let's fix everything related to ffi in Sage".

Can we please focus on the first issue only and keep the rest for other tickets?
