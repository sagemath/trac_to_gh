See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/953/log-base-10).  Essentially, the poster requests (and it seems reasonable) to add a couple more examples of this.  E.g.,

```
If you could make this change it would be great: "EXAMPLES:
sage: log(e^2)" :
To something like: EXAMPLES: To change the base of the logarithm, add a second parameter. sage: log(1000,10): 3
Small change but helpful!
```

Some comments:
1. When you add a patch and you are confident that it is correct, set the flag "Needs review" under "Modify Ticket".
2. Your patch touches a *lot* of files! From a two-line patch, it has bloated into a 285kB file. The reason is that when you installed sage (I suspect you installed sage in a fat/ntfs partition), all the files got changed to executable files. This needs fixing.

Hello, Can you fix your name in the hg header, at the top of the patch? The names don't match. If you used someone else's hgrc file, then you need to set your own email and name in the hgrc file.

A few things I would like to see:
- Instead of `log()` I would prefer to see linking via `:meth:`log()``
- The line `Use with the RDF function...`, I would change it to
  {{{
  You can use the :class:`RDF<sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleField_class>`,
  :class:`~sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField` or ``n`` to get a numerical real approximation::
  }}}
  since `RDF` is the real double field and it is constructing an element of that class.
- Remove the line about the `n` function
- Add your real name as the author on the trac ticket

You can check to make sure the documentation looks correct too by calling `sage -docbuild reference html` and looking in the `doc/output/html/` folder in your web browser.

Thanks,

Travis
