See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/953/log-base-10).  Essentially, the poster requests (and it seems reasonable) to add a couple more examples of this.  E.g.,

```
If you could make this change it would be great: "EXAMPLES:
sage: log(e^2)" :
To something like: EXAMPLES: To change the base of the logarithm, add a second parameter. sage: log(1000,10): 3
Small change but helpful!
```

Some comments:
1. When you add a patch and you are confident that it is correct, set the flag "Needs review" under "Modify Ticket".
2. Your patch touches a **lot** of files! From a two-line patch, it has bloated into a 285kB file. The reason is that when you installed sage (I suspect you installed sage in a fat/ntfs partition), all the files got changed to executable files. This needs fixing.

```

A few things I would like to see:
- Instead of `log()` I would prefer to see linking via `:meth:`log()``
- The line `Use with the RDF function...`, I would change it to
  {{{
  You can use the :class:`RDF<sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleField_class>`,
  :class:`~sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealField` or ``n`` to get a numerical real approximation::
  }}}
  since `RDF` is the real double field and it is constructing an element of that class.
- Remove the line about the `n` function
- Add your real name as the author on the trac ticket

You can check to make sure the documentation looks correct too by calling `sage -docbuild reference html` and looking in the `doc/output/html/` folder in your web browser.

Thanks,

Travis
