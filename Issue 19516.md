This is a container ticket for minor documentation typos found in version 6.10, to be fixed for 7.0. I'll add them here, if I am not doing another ticket for same part of Sage. Of course others can also make additions to this.

- "eulerian" vs. "Eulerian" and other name-based terms that should start with capital in English. Quite easy to find by grep.

Thanks.

At #13250 can you add a little modification: in `lattices.py` function `is_geometric()` remove


```
sage: S = SetPartitions(3)
sage: L = LatticePoset( (S, lambda a, b: S.is_less_than(a, b)) )
```


and instead put


```
sage: L = Posets.SetPartitions(4)
```


?

There is no space before `|` in "|Return the linear extensions graph of the poset." I am paranoid about Sphinx: will this break it?

Otherwise all seems good. I am compiling just to be sure.
