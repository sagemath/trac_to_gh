Errors building `sagemath_doc_html` have been frequent recently.

On Linux and macOS, it seems this usually solves it:

```
$ make -s V=0 doc-clean doc-uninstall && make -s V=0
```


Failing that, this has also worked for some:

```
$ make -s V=0 distclean && make -s V=0
```


On Cygwin, none of these helped for me.
