This patch implements algorithms for computing the Gromov hyperbolicity of a graph. Although the worst case time complexity is in `O(n^4)`, the proposed implementation performs quite well in practice. It has been used on graphs with more than 10.000 vertices.

Here is my current patch, and two comments :

* It would be nice if ``sage -coverage hyperbolicity.pyx`` returned "100% coverage". I hate to say it, because it often means adding useless tests just to fit to the metrics `-_-`
* What is the use of _reduce_biconnected_graph compared to goodcores ? The docstring says that this function, by removing degree 2 vertices whose neighborhood is an edge, would reduce a complete bipartite graph to an edge... But no vertex of a complete bipartite graph is adjacent to two adjacent vertices (a triangle). I do not see how (as the docstring says) this function does anything different from the good core decomposition method above.

It would also be better to set this ticket to `need_work` until your have found out where the bug you found comes from. 

Tell me what you think of the changes I made ! They should make the html doc nicer !

OK, I will work on this.

Useless, but since it is very fast (linear) it can be used for all methods, while goodcores is only for cuts+.

Oups. We must add an edge to get many triangles.

Oh. But what is the difference between this function and the other one, what is it that `_reduce_biconnected_graph` can do and that the core decomposition can't ? Is their running time very different for the same purposes ? Why do you need two functions ?

Hello,

I have fully revised the patch. I have merged both patches into a new one to simplify the process. I have removed the `_reduce_biconnected_graph` and `good_core_decomposition` methods and added a new one: `elimination_buckets`, where a bucket is understood as a set of vertices that can be eliminated as soon as the lower equals the index of the bucket. So far, this new function only identifies vertices that can be eliminated as soon as we know that the lower bound is 1. The code contains all the machinery to handle larger values, but I don't have good heuristic/algorithm ready to identify vertices that can be eliminated for 2 (only slow and not efficient methods). I propose to let this part for a future patch. This one is already huge...

The doc coverage is now 100%.

Should be better now.

    "body": "Helloooooooo David !!\n\nWell, I have been working of this patch for the last hour (at least), and I was not able to produce a patch for some of the changes I think would be good for I still do not understand the code well enough, and I only end up producing segfaults...\n\nI think that it would be nice to define the following C struct, for we are in the wonderful world of C where creating structs is totally free (unlike Java `:-P`)\n\n\n```\n# Defining a pair of vertices as a C struct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nctypedef struct pair:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n    int i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n    int j    \n```\n\n\nThis way, you do not have wird `+2` increments anymore, and you can call the `invert_cells` function only once (to exchange pair structs, not integers).\n\nI wanted to add the following documentation \n\n```\n    # We organize the pairs of vertices by length in an array of pair structs                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n    #                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n    # - path_of_length[i] point to the list of nb_path_of_length[i] pairs of                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n    #   vertices at distance i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n    #                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n    # - cpt_path[i] counts the number of pairs have already been added to                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n    #   path_of_length[i]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n    #                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n    # - all_pairs is a memory block of binomial(n,2) pairs of                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n    #   vertices. path_of_length[i] points toward a memory area contained in -                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n    #   all_pairs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n    #        \n```\n\nto replace your \n\n```\n# We organize the path by length in an array using 2 cells per path.\n```\n\nthough it only makes sense in my segfaulting version of hyperbolicity.pyx. If you agree with this change from integers toward pairs, then this doc could be useful.\n\nOther comments :\n* I do not see the point of using uint64_t instead of integers. I mean, if we all agree that the code is not supposed to run on 16-bits machines `:-P` The integers you need are -- in the worst case -- of order `n^2`, which may reach the 32bits limit only if the graph has size around 40k vertices. The rest of the time, requiring the integers to be 64bits just means moving around blocks of 0, and will be slower than int on 32 bits machines. Except if I missed something somewhere `O_o` Plus the code would be muuuuuuuuch easier to read without that `:-P`\n* You say several times that you compute the number of paths of each length. This scared me for you did this with only +1 increments, and the number of paths of each length is possibly... HUGE (of order `n!` in a complete graph).

Helloooooooo David !!

Well, I have been working of this patch for the last hour (at least), and I was not able to produce a patch for some of the changes I think would be good for I still do not understand the code well enough, and I only end up producing segfaults...

I think that it would be nice to define the following C struct, for we are in the wonderful world of C where creating structs is totally free (unlike Java `:-P`)


```
# Defining a pair of vertices as a C struct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
ctypedef struct pair:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
    int i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    int j    
```


This way, you do not have wird `+2` increments anymore, and you can call the `invert_cells` function only once (to exchange pair structs, not integers).

I wanted to add the following documentation 

```
    # We organize the pairs of vertices by length in an array of pair structs

    #        
```

to replace your 

```
# We organize the path by length in an array using 2 cells per path.
```

though it only makes sense in my segfaulting version of hyperbolicity.pyx. If you agree with this change from integers toward pairs, then this doc could be useful.

Other comments :
* I do not see the point of using uint64_t instead of integers. I mean, if we all agree that the code is not supposed to run on 16-bits machines `:-P` The integers you need are -- in the worst case -- of order `n^2`, which may reach the 32bits limit only if the graph has size around 40k vertices. The rest of the time, requiring the integers to be 64bits just means moving around blocks of 0, and will be slower than int on 32 bits machines. Except if I missed something somewhere `O_o` Plus the code would be muuuuuuuuch easier to read without that `:-P`
* You say several times that you compute the number of paths of each length. This scared me for you did this with only +1 increments, and the number of paths of each length is possibly... HUGE (of order `n!` in a complete graph). What you compute is actually the number of pairs of distance l for each l. Some names of variables need to be updated.
* elimination_bucket : hmmm... Well, this method is written so that it is able to deal with code that.... it does not contain :-P

    - Then, we take a vertex ``u``. The diameter in ``G`` of the subgraph of its

```

 And it returns a list of things, in which only the first element will have any use (the one corresponding to vertices whose neighborhood is a clique) for the other ones will be empty. And the `max_diameter` is completely useless, ...
* Oh, and you can use `sage_calloc` to allocate and set to zero at the same time.

I attach a small patch that deals with unimportant things.

Hellooooooooooooooooooo !!

A better day begins, with music. Music solves everything `:-P`

> 1. Yes we can define a structure to store extremities of paths, but I'm not so sure it is totally free. I agree it could be easier to read.

Oh. C struct ? Yeah, they are free. Especially when their size is 2*sizeof(int) `:-P`

> 1. I agree with proposed improvement of documentation
> 1. Concerning the uint64_t. I did some tests with very large graphs, so it was useful at least for me (I also used that type to count number of visited 4-tuples although it is not part of this patch). 

What ? `O_o`
Do you mean that in some situation regular int were not enough ? I really wonder where `O_O;;;`

Furthermore, I'm not so sure we can use int instead, and clearly unsigned int or unsigned long int would be harder to read that uint64_t. 

Well, it seems to me that you can easily use regular 32 bits int without any proble, so that coding this with int should work. You count vertices (less than `2^16=65536`, and even less than `2^15=32768`.

Well, the extra computing time is negligible, but it makes it much harder to understand when you try to read the code. And. Well, it does nothing `^^;` Could you keep a copy of this method instead, to be used when you will have heuristics to plug there, and in the meantime keep Sage's code optimal with what is implemented and not what we plan to implement eventually ? `:-P`

> 1. sage_calloc: was not aware of it. is it safe? stable? can we safely use it if we use structures instead of arrays of numbers?

Oh. Well, calloc is a C function, so I guess that it is just wrapped by sage, the same way malloc and free are wrapped.
http://linux.die.net/man/3/calloc

> 1. extra tmp variable: since the function _invert_cells is inlined, it means each execution would have to instantiate a new variable. I'm not sure it is better/faster than current implementation.

Here is how the function is writted right now :


```
cdef inline _invert_cells(uint64_t * tab, uint64_t idxa, uint64_t idxb, uint64_t tmp): 
     tmp = tab[idxa] 
     tab[idxa] = tab[idxb] 
     tab[idxb] = tmp 
```


Let us assume for a start that the function is *NOT* inlined. In this case, the value of "tmp" that the function received as input is totally useless : the function creates a new local variable named tmp, and assigns to it the value of tmp given as input.
Well, that is useless for a new local variable is created.

And if the function is inlined, a variable will be created, well then there is no problem for a variable will be created inside of the function that call it to do exactly what you are doing.

But. Well, how much do you want to bet that it is totally impossible to detect the difference between the two codes, even if _invert_cells called malloc(sizeof(int)) manually each time this function is called ? `:-P`

On some computers, unsigned long int are on 32 bits. When you count the number of visited 4-tuples, you can exceed `2^32-1`. It happens when working on biconnected graphs with more than 20000 vertices (kind of graphs I'm currently considering).

I have implemented all proposed changes:
- use of a struct for pairs
- use of sage_calloc when appropriate
- use uint32_t instead of uint64_t when appropriate. These types are shorter to write/read. Also uint64_t is needed for distributions since number could potentially be huge (more theoretical than practical due to huge computation time)
- improve ordering for visiting pairs
- simplify pre-processing and corresponding data structure. It now only considers simplicial vertices.

I have merged the [attachment:a.patch] into the new version of the patch: [attachment:trac_13808-v3.patch]. The patch is much better now, the doc is nicer, and it is a bit faster.
