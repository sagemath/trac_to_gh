The reviewer patch makes the following small changes:
- no longer include `interrupt.pxi` (`pari_err.pxi` suffices)
- fix inaccurate docstrings
- delete an unnecessary conversion (Cython is more efficient when the conversion is left implicit)

This is indeed an improvement over the existing half-baked `_pari_init_()`.  Looks good and tests pass.
