# Issue 22453: Fix segfault in Singular that occurs when piping to its stdin if not attached to a TTY

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22690

Original creator: embray

This is the easiest way I've found to reproduce this issue:


```
$ echo -e '3+3;\n' | setsid Singular/Singular
                     SINGULAR                                 /  Development
 A Computer Algebra System for Polynomial Computations       /   version 4.1.0
                                                           0<

```


This is preventing some tests from passing when running in a docker container without a TTY (in particular, when building the patchbot container, which always does a baseline check during the container build).

I have a patch I will add shortly.

Changing keywords from "" to "singular".

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Will probably need rebasing on #22425, unless we want to roll this into that.

I guess this is fixed in Singular 4.1.0p3?
I'm currently making a ticket for the upgrade.

Comment by embray created at 2017-04-25 13:58:48

I don't know; please double-check that the patch is already applied.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-04-25 15:12:34

Hum, I don't think it is unfortunately.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-17 09:09:13

Seems like this needs a rebase.

Done.

Thanks.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

The version is wrong. The format is

```
UPSTREAMVERSION.pSAGEPATCHLEVEL
```


So it should be

```
4.1.0p3.p0
```

(confusing, but that's how it is)

Argh, you're right. Did not sleep enough last night...


---

Comment by embray created at 2017-05-18 09:06:40

Oops--that is truly confusing.  I'll just redo it.

Makes me wonder if there isn't some way we could have an automatic "patch level", perhaps using a hash of the spkg directory or something.  Could just be more confusing though.  I could see advantages and disadvantages...


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-18 09:20:42

Ok, now it is completely ok.

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-19 08:14:28

Hum, I'm quite sure I checked that this was not included in the p3 release...
I must have been wrong.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2017-05-19 08:23:23

Ok, I can confirm the patch is actually included in 4.1.0p3, so this ticket is fixed by #22868.
Let's close this one then.

Ok I get it now, I first checked this was missing but from p2, not from p3...


---

Comment by embray created at 2017-05-19 08:26:04

Ah, okay.  Thanks for checking!
