I see that the PARI function `ellj` also takes in precision. Should we also pass in the precision into that as well?

# Style Suggestions:
* Add extra line before function.
* Delete spaces around equal sign.
* Indentation should be a multiple of 4.

# Doc string suggestions:
* Add prec to the input line of documentation.
