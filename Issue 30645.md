# Issue 30645: cygwin: OpenBLAS build fails with internal compiler error from gfortran

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30882

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2020-11-10 13:51:24

CC:  mkoeppe

Keywords: openblas cygwin

with


```
$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (GCC) 10.2.0
```


the build fails at


```
[openblas-0.3.9] gfortran -O2 -Wall -frecursive -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -m64 -fPIC  -c -o sbdsvdx.o sbdsvdx.f
[openblas-0.3.9] gfortran -O2 -Wall -frecursive -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -m64 -fPIC  -c -o spotrf2.o spotrf2.f
[openblas-0.3.9] f951: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault
```


Has anyone else seen this (much less on any other platform)?

I can't finish building Sage 9.2 because of this.

I was unable to reproduce the error on Linux with gfortran 10.2.0.

The problem appears to be emanating from Sage's MPIR, which apparently I built.  I forget whether or not we added support for using the system GMP/MPFR but I'll try that.  Can't tell if it's a bug in gfortran or just some more subtle incompatibility between gfortran 10.2 and sage's MPIR.

Indeed, the incompatibility arises from using Cygwin's gfortran with Sage's MPIR+MPFR.

MPIR's build outputs a DLL with dllname cyggmp-23.dll, whereas MPFR outputs to cygmpfr-6.dll.

Cygwin's gfortran (specifically the f951.exe compiler executable) is linked against cygmpfr-6.dll and cyggmp-10.dll.  This results in loading Sage's mpfr, which in turn loads Sage's cyggmp-23.dll, but it also still loads cyggmp-10.dll from the system.  This wreaks havoc or reasons I don't fully understand, but the point at which the segfault is occurring is because it's trying to write to memory where the cyggmp-10.dll's image is loaded.

Honestly I'm not sure how we avoided this situation in the past.  MPIR has not been updated in a long time, and it's long output libgmp-23.dll in GMP-compatibility installs, whereas the GMP in Cygwin has long been versioned libgmp-10.dll.  So it's likely this has always been a problem, and just didn't occur before by luck (?).

The simplest workaround to this is to ensure to use GMP+MPFR+MPC from the system if possible.  But when not, it seems we need to match the DLL versions of these libraries to the ones used by GCC.  When linking MPIR in particular it might be necessary to link a separate copy of the GMP DLL with the name cyggmp-10.dll for compatibility purposes.

FWIW, the automatic tests on GH Actions do not test this configuration.
`cygwin-standard` has both system MPIR and system gfortran,
and `cygwin-minimal` has neither of the two.

However, I do see some internal compiler errors from `gcc` on `cygwin-minimal` - for example in https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/1592024084 while building `curl`, `numpy`, `pillow`, and `suitesparse`
