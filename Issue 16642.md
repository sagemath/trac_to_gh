Hello,

The cache part is cool!

I am not confident of having everything switched into Cython. It is much harder to debug and can also makes things slower. Especially with functions like `wilson_construction`, `OA_n_times_2_pow_c_from_matrix`... Why not only switch to C for the cache part? The function `orthogonal_array` might also move and we might also recreate the `orthogonal_array_available` from #16875.

In the function `orthogonal_array`, I do not remember what was the point of the variable `may_be_availale` in `orthogonal_arrays`... And I am confused by the way it is used: if it is `False` then there is no need to go further (but it concerns only the case when `existence=False`).

Yo !

Yep.

> I am not confident of having everything switched into Cython.

I don't like it either. And it takes a lifetime to compile.

Really ? Do you have an example ? `O_o`

> Why not only switch to C for the cache part?

Well, I can't cimport a cdef function in a .py file, but perhaps that does not matter. I will move th caching code to designs_pyx.

> The function `orthogonal_array` might also move and we might also recreate the `orthogonal_array_available` from #16875.

I am thinking about that. What is the difference between this `orthogonal_array_available` and the current `orthogonal_array` ? I don't talk about the user interface, just about speed. When the answer is cached (most frequent case), what is it that `orthogonal_array_is_available` does that `orthogonal_array` does not ? Only check that `k is not None` ?

No need to go further to test constructions. But there may be non-existence proofs implemented. That was the logic.

Almost anything:

```
def f():
    from sage.rings.arith import is_prime
    from sage.quadratic_forms.extras import is_triangular_number

    for i in range(2,1000):
        is_prime(i)
        is_triangular_number(i)
```

then I got

```
sage: timeit("f_python()", number=100)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.7 ms per loop
sage: timeit("f_cython()", number=100)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.9 ms per loop
```

Not very significant, but still.

That's why we can move `orthogonal_array` as well.

If `orthogonal_array` is cythonized... not much. Otherwise, function calls.

How is this for you ? I plan on modifying `orthogonal_array_recursive` now, and turn it into a .pyx file. The only time-consuming operations that occur there are the `find_*` functions which may benefit from C integer variables.

Plus I plan on writing a small function `cdef bint _is_available(k,n)` there that will 1) check the cache 2) call orthogonal_array(k,n,existence=1) if needed: the point is that because this function is a cdef one,  for most calls no Python will be involved at all.

Tell me what you think of this patch, for I cannot begin that if I am not sure that the cache function stay in designs_pyx.

Have fuuuuuun !

Right now, the branch `public/16879b` looks good except that you should remove

```
+              extra_compile_args = ['-g'],

The diff is not that big, why not doing everything here (i.e. switching to cython for the find-part of `orthogonal_array_recursive`)?

I don't mind, I just split stuff to make it easier for you to review. I'll do that now.

Not as impressive as I had hoped. Without the branch it takes 13s to go to n=1000. With the branch it takes 9.65s.

Of course with your prime power improvement it takes 3.4s to go to 1000. and 1.3s for 600.

Okay, let's say that it is a win `:-P`

Hello,

More speed up at `public/16879c` (pass from 14.2sec to 13.6sec for the first 1200 MOLS). Now that `is_available` is a cdef, it is the fastest to call so we should always try this one first.

What do you think about moving the actual constructions in `orthogonal_arrays.py` and globally import them in `orthogonal_array_recursive.py`? I do not like to have them in Cython (it takes lifetime to compile, you get ugly backtrace, ...).

Cool ! By the way wouldn't `is_available(q+1,q)` be faster than `is_prime_power` at some point ? `:-PPPPPPPPPPPPP`

Anyway, if this `is_prime_power` stuff keeps on slowing us down we will just cache the first 10 000 values and get rid of the problem.

It's not the job of `sage.combinat.design`... and note that I work hard to make `is_prime`, `is_prime_power`, `prime_range` and `prime_power_range` faster.

Perfect... why not `orthogonal_arrays_build_recursive.py` it would be even clearer.

Hello,

Why `is_available` is in `orthogonal_arrays_find_recursive` instead of `designs_pyx`? Even if it is `cdef` you can cimport it.

One commit at `public/16879c`... it appears that:
- `divisors` is really slow and it is better to do a stupid loop and check divisibility (might not be True for integer > 1000)
- the kind of loop `for m in [1]+range(min(k,19), 122):` is very badly cythonized
- after a `%crun`, we still have to work on `find_wilson_decomposition_with_two_truncated_groups` and `find_recursive_find_construction_3_3`

Perhaps, but your fix is ugly.

Let's keep it where it is right now. But I am not sure at that point that we care a C function call.

It depends where you look at! The C code of the first version was definitely ugly! Do you have a better idea to make it work?

It is slower. An import of an already imported library cost (as you saw with the move imports from #16875). Not a lot, but repeated it does!

A very big cost, indeed!! I split the commits into two. The second one is about imports. The following timings refer to %time MOLS_table(60)

Helloooooo !!!

> I understand, but there is really something to improve here... no problem to remove my modifications but then what?

What about forgetting the lower bound ? This trick was there to save calls to `orthogonal_array(existence=True)` but now that we have this cdef function it's fine and it does not cost very much to check whether there exists a `OA(q+15,q)`. And it will become the the usual for loop afterward, with the 'range' replaced by C code.

God. It can actually be detected ? `O_o`

Crazy. Okay, so we keep that. Damn imports.

By the way, the `%` and `/` and `//` operators are not translated into pure Cython code as they should. There is still some Python code about handling the /0 and %0 cases. There is a workaround though:

It would be a good thing to see if corner cases (like m=1 or t=1 in Wilson constructions with one or two truncated blocks) are not handled by other constructions. These corner cases seem to be really expansive.

An other idea would be to have only one find function for product + wilson one truncated + wilson two truncated.

WTF. With pure C variable we still get some crazy Python translations! Cython is sometimes very nice but sometimes really annoying. I dream of a special flag that allows you to say "do not translate this block to anything, this is pure C and I known what I am doing".

We would only save the time it takes to run the product+wilson constructions. Either way let's do this on another ticket.

We can actually add this at the top of the file (before the module's doc)

```
# cython: cdivision=True

I don't mind the imports, if it can be detected then no problem. I just don't want reviews to become "coding style fights"..... I do mind the 10 lines in exchange for the bad "for', though `:-P`

Can we keep this as it is until we find a proper way to avoid it ?

> If you don't know then just wait for beta2

Then please release this beta2, beacuse you do not achieve anything by setting this patch in `needs_work` while not giving me any way to fix it. As you can see by clicking on the "commits" link, this patch has an history of around ~50 commits that are only linked together on your own computer. And it is rather hard to work with this amount of dependencies "in the dark".
