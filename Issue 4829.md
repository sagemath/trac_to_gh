Hi,

in the beginning list of the 40 contributors, the name "Nicolas Thiery" is misspelled.
("i" and "e" are interchanged). Apart from that, positive review from my side.

As mentioned in #4928 I am changing the number of Open Source packages to 83.

I am also fixing the typo and will attach the final release notes shortly.

Cheers,

Michael

Merged in Sage 3.2.3 - a little late, but it is finally in :)

Cheers,

Some bits of the 3.2.3 release notes slipped into the 3.2.2 release notes, so I removed them. This was also merged in *3.2.2*, not *3.2.3*.

Cheers,

Michael
