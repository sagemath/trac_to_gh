I'm happy to see this happening! At the beginning of the SageManifolds project, it was pretty clear that graphs would be the proper way to deal with subsets, but I was not familiar with this part of Sage and wanted to move fast...

This would be nice, indeed. Playing with the doctest examples, 

```
sage: view(latex(D))                                                                                
sage: view(latex(P))                                                                                
```

yields nice figures, with the latex names.

Yes, I think there are many more digraph / poset structures in sage.manifolds that could be exposed by similar methods in follow-up tickets.

On this ticket I am not making an attempt to actually change any of the internal representations of these structures. Just providing some tools that give a high-level view on the existing structures.

LGTM. 

*Side note:* it's a pity that the subsets latex names cannot be used for the plots. 
I've not found such an option in the `plot` method of graphs; for posets, one can use the option `element_labels` as follows:

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
sage: U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V'); W = M.open_subset('W')
sage: VW = V.union(W)
sage: P = M.subset_poset()
sage: P.plot(element_labels={s: s._name for s in M.subsets()})
```

Do you think it is worth to include this trick in the documentation?

Here's a new version in which the vertices of graph and poset representing manifold subsets are wrapped in an extra layer of a `frozenset`. This new format is intended to be future-proof for the changes necessary to fix #30263:  Basically, one will need to quotient out by the equality relation of subsets.

In fact, instead of using `frozenset` directly, I define a subclass called `ManifoldSubsetSet`, which is convenient for printing and sorting.

Thanks for the update. Looks good. I've got two remarks:

1. Is there any reason for the names `FiniteManifoldObjectFamily` and `FiniteManifoldSubsetFamily` instead of `ManifoldObjectFiniteFamily` and `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily`? The latter ones sound more natural to me, making clear that we are dealing with finite families.

2. To generate the documentation about these classes in the reference manual, the new entry `sage/manifolds/family` must be added to `src/doc/en/reference/manifolds/manifolds.rst`

Good idea, done.

Thanks for the changes. One minor remark: shouldn't

```
TypeError: all... subsets must have the same manifold
```

be replaced by 

```
TypeError: all open subsets must have the same manifold
```

in the output of the doctest

```
sage: ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily([M, N])
```

in `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` ? Both doctests passed, but the latter is identical to the actual message get by the user. 

Besides, do you think it is worth to add `PLOT` directives like

```
        .. PLOT::

            M = Manifold(3, 'M')
            U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V'); W = M.open_subset('W')
            VW = V.union(W)
            P = M.subset_poset()
            g = P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})
            sphinx_plot(g)
```

immediately after the doctest

```
            sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})
```

to generate plots of posets and digraphs in the reference manual?

In any case, I would suggest that the doctest markers `# not tested` are removed from the `plot` examples:

```diff
- sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})  # not tested
+ sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})                              
+ Graphics object consisting of 10 graphics primitives
```
