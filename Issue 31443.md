The declared subsets or supersets of a `ManifoldSubset` form finite posets. We add methods to expose them as instances of `FinitePoset`.

I'm happy to see this happening! At the beginning of the SageManifolds project, it was pretty clear that graphs would be the proper way to deal with subsets, but I was not familiar with this part of Sage and wanted to move fast...

This would be nice, indeed. Playing with the doctest examples, 

```
sage: view(latex(D))                                                                                
sage: view(latex(P))                                                                                
```

yields nice figures, with the latex names.

Yes, I think there are many more digraph / poset structures in sage.manifolds that could be exposed by similar methods in follow-up tickets.

On this ticket I am not making an attempt to actually change any of the internal representations of these structures. Just providing some tools that give a high-level view on the existing structures.

LGTM. 

*Side note:* it's a pity that the subsets latex names cannot be used for the plots. 
I've not found such an option in the `plot` method of graphs; for posets, one can use the option `element_labels` as follows:

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M')
sage: U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V'); W = M.open_subset('W')
sage: VW = V.union(W)
sage: P = M.subset_poset()
sage: P.plot(element_labels={s: s._name for s in M.subsets()})
```

Do you think it is worth to include this trick in the documentation?

Here's a new version in which the vertices of graph and poset representing manifold subsets are wrapped in an extra layer of a `frozenset`. This new format is intended to be future-proof for the changes necessary to fix #30263:  Basically, one will need to quotient out by the equality relation of subsets.

In fact, instead of using `frozenset` directly, I define a subclass called `ManifoldSubsetSet`, which is convenient for printing and sorting.

Good idea, done.

Thanks for the changes. One minor remark: shouldn't

```
TypeError: all... subsets must have the same manifold
```

be replaced by 

```
TypeError: all open subsets must have the same manifold
```

in the output of the doctest

```
sage: ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily([M, N])
```

in `ManifoldSubsetFiniteFamily` ? Both doctests passed, but the latter is identical to the actual message get by the user. 

Besides, do you think it is worth to add `PLOT` directives like

```
        .. PLOT::

            M = Manifold(3, 'M')
            U = M.open_subset('U'); V = M.open_subset('V'); W = M.open_subset('W')
            VW = V.union(W)
            P = M.subset_poset()
            g = P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})
            sphinx_plot(g)
```

immediately after the doctest

```
            sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})
```

to generate plots of posets and digraphs in the reference manual?

In any case, I would suggest that the doctest markers `# not tested` are removed from the `plot` examples:

```diff
- sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})  # not tested
+ sage: P.plot(element_labels={element: element._name for element in P})                              
+ Graphics object consisting of 10 graphics primitives
```
