I tried replacing the script in the current (nonfunctional) mac app by this version and that fixed it for me.

How do I test it?

If I replace `start-sage.sh` with the patched version in the directory `SageMath-7.1.beta2.app/Contents/Resources` then the application gets stuck in "Verifying the volume". (For a good reason, I suppose, as changing probably broke some control sum...".
Is there a way to fix this quickly? 

Otherwise, could you rebuild the app with this change, to try it?

ok, it's just `$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine SageMath-7.1.beta2.app` to avoid this step...
