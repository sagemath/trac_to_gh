If I replace `start-sage.sh` with the patched version in the directory `SageMath-7.1.beta2.app/Contents/Resources` then the application gets stuck in "Verifying the volume". (For a good reason, I suppose, as changing probably broke some control sum...".
Is there a way to fix this quickly? 

Otherwise, could you rebuild the app with this change, to try it?
