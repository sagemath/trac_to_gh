The following code may take 1 second or not terminate in 1 minute, depending on random choices in the algorithm:


```
sage: K=GF(4,'a')                                                          
sage: a=K.gens()[0]
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: f=(a + 1)*x^145*y^84 + (a + 1)*x^205*y^17 + x^32*y^112 + x^92*y^45
sage: time r=f.factor(proof=False)
```
