# Issue 19427: Make Laurent series comparison more efficient

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-12-03 12:50:37

The `_cmp_` function for Laurent series can be improved in efficiency.

In particular, this is bad:

```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: x^(10^10) > 0
...
MemoryError: 
```
