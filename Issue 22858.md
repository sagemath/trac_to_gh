After making a minor change to `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/generator.py`, the change did not take effect. I.e. the generated file `src/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pyx` did *not* change.

In particular, the following should cause an error while building the interpreters, but it did not:

I think at some earlier version of this (before it was merged) it did check all source files?  I don't know when it changed.

I think there was one point where it was `src_files` but in one of the last rebases it got messed up.

I'm not sure why you're using `OSError` here.  ~~It doesn't really matter~~ (actually I'd say it does matter--I think a real OSError should be allowed to rise here, or at least be handled separately), but it looks odd.  If the point is just to catch some exception just a generic `Exception` would be fine.  Looks good to me otherwise; sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused.
