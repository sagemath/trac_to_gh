After running `./sage -f spkg/standard/libm4rie-20120613.spkg` on OS X 10.8.2, there is a *directory* with a name like `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/sage-testcflags-24223.dSYM/`, created by the script `testcflags.sh`. The attached patch cleans this up.

positive review provided you add a comment along the lines

```
# Some OS X systems create a directory with debug info, so we really need -r here (#13945)
```
