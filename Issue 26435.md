# Issue 26435: clean generic_graph.py (part 10) - degree

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dcoudert

CC:  tscrim

Keywords: py3, graph

Here we improve the documentation and doctests of methods `degree`, `average_degree`, `degree_histogram`, `degree_iterator`, `degree_sequence`, `is_regular`.

In particular, we make it clear that a call to `.degree()` returns a list of the degrees of the vertices in the order of `list(G)` and not of `.vertices()`.
