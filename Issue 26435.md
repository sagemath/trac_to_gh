Keywords: py3, graph

Here we improve the documentation and doctests of methods `degree`, `average_degree`, `degree_histogram`, `degree_iterator`, `degree_sequence`, `is_regular`.

In particular, we make it clear that a call to `.degree()` returns a list of the degrees of the vertices in the order of `list(G)` and not of `.vertices()`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26672
