# Issue 18731: LMFDB label for elliptic curves

We should support LMFDB labels, e.g.

```
sage: EllipticCurve('11.a2') == EllipticCurve('11a1')
True
```

See http://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/ec.q.lmfdb_label for details on LMFDB labels.

The best way to do this would be to change the SQL database (small version standard, extended version optional) to include these labels.  Then it will be easy.  Otherwise conversion of labels is non-trivial (as you know very well, roed!).

The entire permutation is also available at https://github.com/JohnCremona/ecdata/tree/master/alllabels

It might also be nice to have a method that returns the URL in LMFDB for a given elliptic curve when possible (i.e., when the LMFDB label is known).

Sure, though much grander plans are around (with no-one yet having the time to do it) for a good interface from Sage to LMFDB using the api Harald wrote (see http://www.lmfdb.org/api/).

Actually Kiran's proposal is much easier since the LMFDB does understand Cremona labels so the URL "http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/%s" % E.label()
should always work right now.

Here is a poor-man tentative for adding links to lmfdb, not working.

This is a great idea.  Note that the LMFDB can parse URLs of the form .../EllipticCurve/11a1 where the last part '11a1' is the Cremona label, as well as the LMFDB label version with a ".".

this:

```
http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/11a1/
```

does not work (ie does not lead to the page of the curve itself)

So what is the correct syntax for the link ?

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. New commits:

ok, it seems to work using

```
http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/11a1
```

Should I move the branch to another ticket, because this is not the exact aim of this one ?

Sorry I got that wrong but you know what I meant to say.
Yes, it is a different thing than the title of this ticket and so should be separate.
We plan via ODK to have a much more systematic interface from Sage to LMFDB objects and this can be the start of that.

see now ticket #21533 for adding the webpage method
