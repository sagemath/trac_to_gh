I thought about reducing live doc building time. But it seems that this should be done on jupyter-sphinx side, or rather by forking it to make our own tailored for sage. In short, this belongs to a wishlist.

As the live doc is optional, it is safe to merge this branch now.

I think the new environment variables should use a prefix `SAGE_` and it would be good if they could be set by `src/sage_docbuild/__init__.py` like it sets environment variables `SAGE_SKIP_PLOT_DIRECTIVE` etc.  I don't think they should go through `sage.env`.

Some questions:

- Should the live docs be built in a different location (for example "html_live") so that it can coexist with the static documentation? Then it would play a role more like the PDF documentation.

- Should building the live docs be an option for `./configure`, and/or a `make` target, like the PDF docs? (Separately, I wonder if options like `SAGE_SKIP_PLOT_DIRECTIVE` should also be controlled by `./configure` arguments.)

Live html docs are exactly like the normal html docs with additional "make live" capability. You may see the live docs as an upgrade version. So it makes not much sense to have both.

So if I understand correctly, both (1) during the documentation build and (2) when viewing the documentation, either (a) binder is used or (b) a local Jupyter is used.

When you do 1(b), thebe configuration is baked into the htmls, so you cannot do 2(a).

If you want to do 1(a) for the whole documentation, and do 2(b) for a specific documentation, for instance 'prep', then 

```
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8888
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```
should work, but does not. I don't understand why. Instead you should do

```
sage --docbuild prep html
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER=http://localhost:8888
export SAGE_JUPYTER_SERVER_TOKEN=secret
sage --docbuild --live-doc prep html
```
This is because sphinx recognizes the changes of the config variable `jupyter_execute_default_kernel` but not of `jupyter_sphinx_thebelab_config`. Any idea why?

You mean `make doc-clean; make doc-uninstall; make`? 

The first failure seems not related with this ticket...

I think this is the primary purpose of the documentation -- running the examples as they are. If they want to do variations, they should go to jupyter and copy-paste.

Of course, it is easy to allow user modifications. A couple of configuration changes. But first we have to decide what behavior we want.

This is to be done by editing the documentation. We cannot make jupyter-sphinx an AI.

With the latest commit, live doc building is almost as fast as building the static doc.

sphinx-thebe translates nodes

```
.. container::
   :class: thebe
   
   1 + 1
```
to html elements that can be activated by thebe.

jupyter-sphinx executes nodes

```
.. jupyter_execute::

   1 + 1
```
by jupyter and insert the output to the built htmls and can also insert html elements that can be activated by thebe.

Presently we are using jupyter-sphinx but suppressing jupyter execution part (somewhat clumsily), which we don't need currently.

There is also a discussion (https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-sphinx/issues/137) about using sphinx-thebe for jupyter-sphinx's thebe part. It is unclear how much this progressed.

So I think that from where we stand, there is no clear benefit of switching to sphinx-thebe.

There would be no simple patch. Even if there is a (big) patch, they may not accept it because it is not fixing a bug. 

If we don't like patched source, then perhaps we should switch to sphinx-thebe.

Using live docs, I realized that many example code blocks in sage documentation are not ready for live run, and frequently needs user's editing before run. Hence I changed my mind, and the last commit makes code blocks editable.
