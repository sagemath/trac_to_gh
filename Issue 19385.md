How to install `bliss`?


```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss') 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-8e034558a836> in <module>()
----> 1 G.automorphism_group(algorithm='bliss')

/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.pyc in automorphism_group(self, partition, verbosity, edge_labels, order, return_group, orbits, algorithm)
  20074                 from sage.graphs.bliss import automorphism_group
  20075             except ImportError:
> 20076                 raise ImportError("You must install the 'bliss' package to run this command.")
  20077 
  20078             A = automorphism_group(self, partition)

ImportError: You must install the 'bliss' package to run this command.
```

So what should we have on function level? A custom exception class inherited from `ImportError`, so that UI would detect it? Or raise `ImportError` with predefined format for exception string and little more complicated UI code to detect and parse it?

Jeroen created a `PackageNotFoundError` just for that. It should have been used there (most probably my fault).

OK. Then when should `ImportError` be used?

I don't see a use case right now. It seems that when dealing with packages we should 'catch' the ImportError and raise PackageNotFoundError.

This is a first draft, it still needs some doctests and maybe cleaning up.

Is there a reason why you do it at such a low level? Wouldn't it be possible to just have the new 'fake' module just raise an exception in Python instead of doing it in C?

But can this be customized? I.e. have something like "- - Please ask admin.email`@`our.unit to install it." on maintained system.

I'm using C because it's actually the simplest solution. Otherwise I have to worry what happens is there is an `.so` and a `.py` file for the same module. Now I'm just replacing the sources of a C extension which exists anyway.

Well, it's open source, so it can be customized :-)

What would you propose as user interface for customizing the message?

SageNB already has Settings-tab when logged in as admin. For command line it could be a `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf`, by default a symlink to `/etc/sage/messages.conf`.

When this error happens the system should try to open `$SAGE_ROOT` for writing. If it can, then the message would be "...install with sage -i...". If not, it would open `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf` and print out the content. If that would not exists, then the default message would be something like "...ask your system administrator to...".

Rationale: Let's say we have users `root`, `teacher` and `user`. If `user` installs it, it would be used only for him/her. If `root` install, it will be on `/usr/local/...` and when installing new version the symlink would still point to same help text file. If `teacher` installs, and ask students to run `~teacher/sage/sage`, he/she must manually make the configuration file after every reinstall.

Customizing the error message is outside the scope of this ticket, this just makes the raising of the exception automatic.

OK. So this is off-topic, but still: Can you tell what to modify if I want to play with this kind of things? As an artificial example, print "Aarghs!" after division by zero.

See `PackageNotFoundError` in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

> As an artificial example, print "Aarghs!" after division by zero.
That's a different question since `ZeroDivisionError` is a builtin Python exception which we cannot just change. That's the advantage of using a custom exception class for `PackageNotFoundError`: you can easily change the string which is displayed.

Now, you can probably still play with IPython to customize displaying of exceptions in general, but then that's a very different story.

Thank you for the simplifications to the LP backend code.

That's a feature, not a bug.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-11-26 12:45:32

I can see what the problem is. If you build this ticket, then you have some modules like `sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend`. Checking out a different branch doesn't make these modules go away.

Mildly. Less than I care about #6389, #21175, #21047, #19213, #18029, and below the threshold of rebasing it myself; but enough to look into it if there is a patch that applies.
