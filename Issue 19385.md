I don't see a use case right now. It seems that when dealing with packages we should 'catch' the ImportError and raise PackageNotFoundError.

SageNB already has Settings-tab when logged in as admin. For command line it could be a `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf`, by default a symlink to `/etc/sage/messages.conf`.

When this error happens the system should try to open `$SAGE_ROOT` for writing. If it can, then the message would be "...install with sage -i...". If not, it would open `$SAGE_ROOT/messages.conf` and print out the content. If that would not exists, then the default message would be something like "...ask your system administrator to...".

Rationale: Let's say we have users `root`, `teacher` and `user`. If `user` installs it, it would be used only for him/her. If `root` install, it will be on `/usr/local/...` and when installing new version the symlink would still point to same help text file. If `teacher` installs, and ask students to run `~teacher/sage/sage`, he/she must manually make the configuration file after every reinstall.

See `PackageNotFoundError` in `src/sage/misc/package.py`.

> As an artificial example, print "Aarghs!" after division by zero.

That's a different question since `ZeroDivisionError` is a builtin Python exception which we cannot just change. That's the advantage of using a custom exception class for `PackageNotFoundError`: you can easily change the string which is displayed.

Now, you can probably still play with IPython to customize displaying of exceptions in general, but then that's a very different story.

Mildly. Less than I care about #6389, #21175, #21047, #19213, #18029, and below the threshold of rebasing it myself; but enough to look into it if there is a patch that applies.
