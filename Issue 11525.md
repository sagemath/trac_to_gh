# Issue 11525: global minimal model for elliptic curves in number fields with non-trivial class group

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11697

Original creator: wuthrich

Original creation time: 2011-08-17 15:37:23

Assignee: cremona

Keywords: global minimal model

Currently sage rejects to produce the global minimal Weierstrass equation when the class number is not 1. For instance, this produces an error:


``` 
sage: K.<t> = QuadraticField(-5)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [0,-1,1,-10,-20])
sage: E.global_minimal_model()
}}}

I know.  It has long been on my to-do list to implement a test for existence of a minimal model and give it if it exists.  I convinced myself that this would be easy....

This can be closed as duplicate, since #18662 does exactly this is.
