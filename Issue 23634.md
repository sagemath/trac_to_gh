installed. Note that on this system all test passed before installing the optional packages.

Instead of listing the packages which are not installed, can you instead list the packages which are installed?

Hi Francios,

Thank you for pointing at gmp. I did have gmp installed in the same sage install, but then later did 

```
sage -i mpir
```
which removed gmp from the installed packages list returned by `installed_packages()`. Could this be the cause?

I just did:

```
sage -f database_gap
sage -f gap_packages
```

and this fixed almost all of the failures. For some reason something went wrong with these two packages.

I believe that I have now created a blocker ticket for each of the issues that I could reproduce on a particular x86_64 Linux system.

I could not reproduce the issue with `gap_packages` and `database_gap`: I have no idea what went wrong there. Nor could I reproduce the issue with `pandoc`, but that's probably because `pandoc` is actually installed on the system where I tested it.

Hi Jeroen thanks for putting so much energy in these optional packages,

I recreated the pandoc problem and created #23985 for this with a clear traceback and explanation of why it occurs. I think the `gap_packages` and `database_gap` errors can be regarded as a mistake in installing all these optional packages from my side, because I cannot reproduce it either on the machine where it went wrong.
