I didn't mention that one because it is an acknowledged issue for a long time. The failure in `sage/libs/libecm.pyx` and `sage/interfaces/maxima.py` I was expecting. The other two are new I think, I'll have to check carefully.
The only way to get out of the one with `maxima` is upgrading `ecl`. For `ecm` we may have to change the doctest, I'll dig my emails to Paul about it.

My discussion with Paul is in French, roughly translated it goes:
"It is linked to a change of behavior of the mpz_invert between `5.1.3` and `6.0.0` when the modulo (last argument) is 1

```
zimmerma@coing:/tmp$ cat e.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "gmp.h"

main()
{
 mpz_t a, b;
 int ret;
 printf ("GMP %s\n", gmp_version);
 mpz_init_set_ui (a, 1);
 mpz_init_set_ui (b, 1);
 ret = mpz_invert (a, a, b);
 gmp_printf ("ret=%d a=%Zd\n", ret, a);
}

zimmerma@coing:/tmp$ gcc e.c /usr/local/gmp-5.1.3/lib/libgmp.a

I looked this up and this seems to be since GMP-4.2.3:

```
Changes between GMP version 4.2.2 and 4.2.3
[...]
  Features:
  * The allocation functions now detect overflow of the mpz_t type.  This means
    that overflow will now cause an abort, except when the allocation
    computation itself overflows.  (Such overflow can probably only happen in
    powering functions; we will detect powering overflow in the future.)
