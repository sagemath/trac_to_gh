I don't think this is scaling well. IMO, it would be better to have a class for inner products that holds its (co)domains and takes that into account for comparisons. This would have better separation-of-concerns and make the code easier to maintain.

Addendum: I might also have a use for such a class; plus it would allow you to use coercions.

Maybe you are right. I guess calling the coercion model each time you compute the inner
product is too slow. So explicitly saving the ring might be better.

Somewhat. I was thinking of having a full class for bilinear forms along the lines of:

```python
class BilinearForm(object):
    def __init__(self, V, W, R, matrix):
        self._matrix = matrix
        self._V = V
        self._W = W
        self._codomain = R

    def __call__(self, v, w):
        v = self._V(v)
        w = self._W(w)
        return self._codomain(dot_product_wrt_matrix(v, w))

    def codomain(self):
        return self._codomain
```

Ideally it would inherit from `Morphism`, but we don't have tensor products of `FreeModule`s.

Also, I believe only the first check for a coercion between two objects should be slow and all other subsequent coercion checks between the same two parents are cached.

It shouldn't be. It is just extracting out one component: the bilinear form (matrix). However, you are putting more and more into one class that is not purely a concern for that class. Does the `FreeQuadraticModule` class care about the inner product ring or is that really a concern of the bilinear form?
