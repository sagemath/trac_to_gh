See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3378/).


```
sage: X=[var('x%d' % i) for i in range(20)]
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,"x",11)
sage: R.ideal(x0).groebner_fan()
RuntimeError: Ring variables cannot contain each other as prefixes
```

Presumably this is because of some other software that has this limitation which computes the fan?  I hope I'm understanding the post correctly.
