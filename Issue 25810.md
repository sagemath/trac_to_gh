Doctest failures; see patchbot. My guess is it is from this change:

```
-        z = self.tail().compose(y)*y
-        c = z.coefficient(1)
-
+        z = self.tail().compose(y) * y
```

and not doing `z.coefficient(1)` is not initializing something.

If the patchbot comes back green, then you can set this to a positive review.
