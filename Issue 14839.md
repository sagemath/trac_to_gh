This should be ok, unless I have made a mistake

This is a little "patchbomb", so it would be great if it could be reviewed quickly.

Well, I have only taken care of what happens at startup !

There probably remains many imports not triggered at startup.. 

Let us see what the bot says.

I have made sure that tests pass in

* schemes/elliptic_curves
* combinat

but of course, there are many other places where to look ..

Hmmmmmmmm.... `O_o`

Actually I wonder if those methods shouldn't be deprecated first, as those who used them may not know where they moved... `O_o`

I used ``deprecated_callable_import`` in #14499, isn't it what should be used there too ?

These were deprecated for many years. Try them in vanilla sage.


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2013-09-03 16:35:34

Oh I see ! But then why don't we just remove the deprecated version of the functions too ? It looks like the deprecated functions are not in the namespace anymore, but that they are still defined -- and deprecated somewhere `O_o` ?

What do you mean ?

These functions are not deprecated, it's their import in the global namespace that is.

By the way, even after these patch, some of them will still be imported in the global namespace, and a follow-up ticket will be needed. I prefer to proceed step-by-step.

Oh. Well, what I wondered is which part of the code deprecated the version of these `is_*` functions that appears in the global namespace. I wondered why this code would not be removed by the current patch.

But I just noticed that it was actually a global piece of code, which deprecated all these `is_*` functions together, and thus is not to be removed by this patch.

Anyway : all is good, and this patch can go. My excuses for the delay `;-)`

(and here is where this global piece of code was added, just in case somebody else would like to know : #10107)

Thanks for looking into this Nathann. I really didn't get time to dig into this patch.
