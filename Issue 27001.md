the test is not sufficient to tell version 1.2 from 1.1

Changing keywords from "" to "spkg-configure".

One ought to be able to test for signature of a particular function in gf2x.h, which changed from 1.1 to 1.2.

gf2x takes long time to build, as it does tuning, so that's quite a building speedup.

Is there a mix of tabs and white spaces in that file? Just looking at it in the browser, I didn't checkout the branch. Other than that it looks sound and should do the trick.

Those things are quite clear on the diff but I think they are harmless in M4. Let's move on.

I've provided the upstream with a PR to do a pkg-config configuration, so this could be simplified eventually. See
