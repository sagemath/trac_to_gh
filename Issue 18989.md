Hello Dima,

Here is a first-pass review.

- `coordinates`: why not a boolean? Its default value is `None`, and you did not
  mention its type in the documentation.

- Docstrings of the two new classes: we usually describe what exactly the
  function builds before the input section.

- Could you add a link toward the wikipedia page on generalized quadrangles? I
  do not believe that we have a definition of that in Sage yet.

- The value of `check` arguments is usually `True`.

- As we usually disable checks when calling those functions internally (we only
  check whatever is returned to the user), you may be a bit less careful when
  you check that the hyperoval is indeed an hyperoval, e.g.:
  `Pi.trace(O).is_uniform(2)` or something (I did not check exactly yet).

- `checkhyperoval` -> `check_hyperoval`

- why do you name `O` the hyperoval, given that you have a `hyperoval` variable?
  Use that second name instead?!

Nathann

I don't like to mess around with values of parameters, and then O is shorter too; well, if you insist I can change this...

Dima,

- Documentation of `AhrensSzekeresGQ` -- the first line seems to miss
  backticks. Also, please write complete sentence in english and not 'of GQ
  AS(q)'.

- Same function: you "define" q in the second line of the paragraph while you
  use it in the first.

- Could you rewrite the lines in "set notation", i.e. {{{* `(\sigma, a, b),
  \sigma\in F_q`}}} -> `* `\{(\sigma, a, b): \sigma\in F_q\}``?. It would be
  easier to understand.

- Documentation of `T2starGQ` -- also needs some backticks.

- Same function: `q` should also be defined at the beginning of the paragraph.

- All graph constructors end in 'Graph'. Except the the ones you added recently,
  I missed that `:-/`

- Please do not use GQ anywhere which is not a mathematical notation,
  e.g. neither in paragraphs of documentation nor in the constructor's name. As
  far as I know it is a global Sage convention to write everything expanded as
  much as possible.

- What is the point of the `hyperoval` argument that lets the user specify one?
  It makes the code more complicated, and you do not seem to use it yourself. If
  you remove it, I guess that `check_hyperoval` can be removed too.

- In `is_GQqmqp`: instead of having a 'if' inside of the 'if', could you compute
  q *before* the first if (using `//` instead of `/`) so that you can call
  `is_prime` directly?

- Same function: you don't need to filter which function you should
  import. Import both, there is no time to save there, only added code
  complexity.

- in `ProjectiveGeometryDesign`: could you change the default of
  `point_coordinates`?

01:00 am. Good night `T_T`

Nathann

P.S.: the most troublesome is probably the question above about hypergraph
constructors. Note that there is a (pretty empty) `hypergraphs.<tab>` thing if
you don't consider them to be designs.

this equally applies to most graphs in generators/classical_geometries.
(they are polar spaces, as I told you long ago: cf
http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14532#comment:17 and later comments there; GQs are
polar spaces too, and projective spaces are polar spaces, by the way)

(and probably to more "sporadic" graphs...)

so this is a massive rewrite, and not much fun...

right, all the above is fixed in the last commit.

well, isn't it high time to realise that `graphs.BlahBLahGraph` is an abomination, for stuff in `graphs.*` is meant to be a graph after all...

well, `T_2^*(q)` is in fact `T_2^*(O)`, so I'm following the standard definition.
And there is a sizable cottage industry of hyperoval production out there, so it's good to have things ready for them.

Why? I think it's clean the way it is written. In 99% of the cases we don't even reach the 2nd if.

I do not just import, I set up a function `F` to be called.
This is why I do it this way...

would it make things less efficient?

Hello,

> well, isn't it high time to realise that `graphs.BlahBLahGraph` is an abomination, for stuff in `graphs.*` is meant to be a graph after all...


It is an abomination, but that's the current standard in `graphs.<tab>`. It is still more sensible to have everything end in `Graph` than a different standard for each function. And, indeed, this standard is awful.

> well, `T_2^*(q)` is in fact `T_2^*(O)`, so I'm following the standard definition.


I do not understand this sentence, and I do not understand to what you answer.

> And there is a sizable cottage industry of hyperoval production out there, so it's good to have things ready for them.


Okay.. I'll trust you for that.

> Why? I think it's clean the way it is written. In 99% of the cases we don't even reach the 2nd if.


All you lose is a division per 2. You won't feel it, and the code will be ligther.

If you can measure the difference I owe you a beer.

Also,

```
+    if hyperoval is None:
+        O = filter(lambda x: x[1]+x[2]*x[3]==0 or (x[1]==1 and x[2]==0 and x[3]==0), Pi)
+        O = set(O)

+        O = set(hyperoval)
+
+    if check_hyperoval and (not hyperoval is None):
```

I read:

```
if A:
   ...
else:
   ...
if (not A):
   ...
```

Could you change it into:

```
if hyperoval is None:
   ...
else:
   ...
   if check_hyperoval:
      ...
```

Then it should be good to go,

While GQ is as acceptable abbreviation as LP, and LP is used a lot in Sage code and docs, I realise that I should have been more careful there, sorry...

Update the LP doc to replace it by `Linear Programming` if you think that it is necessary. I've been studying graph theory for the last 7 years or so and I wouldn't recognize GQ if I was told that "This graph is a GQ".

Can't say the same for "This problem has a LP formulation".

Update those functions. It costs you nothing, and it will help people who look for those graphs.

Why? I am totally happy with LP, and GQ, as well.

>I've been studying graph theory for the last 7 years or so and I wouldn't recognize GQ if I was told that "This graph is a GQ".


If a user did not hear about generelised quadrangles then having is spelled out fully in the function name makes no difference for the user. If the user did hear about them then it's very likely that the abbreviated form was also used, and is thus meaningful.

No, sorry, I'm not going to name anything `BlahBlahCollinearityGraphOfGeneralisedQuadrangleGraph`.
