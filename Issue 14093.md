It appears that the strongly regular thing does not handle complete graphs


```
sage: G.is_strongly_regular()
sage: 
```


what it should return is false. I am currently too lazy to fix this so I am reporting it in case anyone of you guys is willing to fix it. Otherwise I might do it at some undefined time in the future.

Hello!

Thank you for the patch! 

The patch appears to be correct but I am not sure it implements the proper conventions. For example on wolfram it is said that the complete graph is strongly regular while wikipedia and the book by Godsil and Royle (algebraic graph theory) both exclude complete graphs from the class of strongly regular graphs. 

Hence I am not sure what to do in this case :-)

I would say that they are. And that when I look at the code and your patch, it is probably what I tried to do but failed by giving the last block a wrong indentation, which you fixed... As there is an `if self.is_clique()` in this code, which returns nothing `:-P`

This is a problem of Dogma, though. What about deciding with head or tails ? Looks like the only honorable way out `:-P`

Eeeehm just checked in the book (http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/spectra.pdf page 123 lol) by Brower and Haemers they exclude the complete graph and its complement as well. 

I like gambling so we can toss a coin though I prefer to exclude complete graphs.

Also while we are at it:


```
2293         degree = self.degree()
2294         k = degree[0]
2295         if not all(d == k for d in degree):
2296             return False
2297 
2298         if self.is_clique():
```


is it perhaps better to call self.is_regular()? I would like that since it somehow leaves any optimizations that is_regular *could* do and has the added benefit that this method does not break for the EmptyGraph (corner cases lol)

Oh. Well, then one would first have to take "any" vertex of the graph, compute its degree, then call `is_regular` on it with this degree as parameter. Otherwise it will call `self.degree()` twice. It's up to you !

Luckily we don't have as many books saying different things as religions do :-)

Anyways, I personally like to have it that way because then there are other theorems for strongly regular graphs that follow naturally. For example a strongly regular graphs has precisely three distinct eigenvalues (which does not hold for the empty graph and complete graph)

That said I don't care what we do with this as long as its fine with you guys. Hence I let you and Frederic decide!

You got a point I overlooked that! BUT we can at least remove the is_clique part and check if the degree is order()-1 once we know its regular right??

Ahahahah. And what if is_clique just computes the number of edges, and if the number of edges is cached ? `:-P`
