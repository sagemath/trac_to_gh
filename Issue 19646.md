For historical reasons, the PARI stack is actually handled "manually" by Sage. The main reason was to implement auto-resizing of the stack in case a command failed due to a stack overflow. With the introduction of `parisizemax`, PARI can handle this on its own.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19883

Sure.

I don't think that this is a problem. It's virtual and unused memory, so it shouldn't hurt at all.

I also wouldn't want to hardcode a `parisizemax` (like in your branch, you use 1G). If you have a machine with lots of RAM, you may want to actually use it.

How is Pari implementing this? In GAP its mmap **without** MAP_NORESERVE, so even if its just virtual memory it reserves swap. And if you do it often (parallel doctesting comes to mind) your swap is used up and virtual allocations suddenly are forced into ram.

Calling mmap without MAP_NORESERVE does reserve first swap and then ram, this is no joke and bit us with gap. Sure overcommit helps but there is a limit to it; Really its just the final warning before the oomkiller strikes. Overcommitting is NOT a happy place to be.

Imho the "try to allocate all memory" approach has a small chance of messing things up badly. Sure it works almost all the time but some day you'll succeed, sbrk almost everything into one process, and then everybody else on the system will have a bad day. It smells of rare and undebuggable random failures.

Then why do you think that overcommitting was invented in the first place? Because processes often ask for more memory than they actually use.

Anyway, let's stop this discussion and think about how to actually choose how much memory to allocate for the PARI stack.
