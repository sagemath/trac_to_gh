I wrote some code that produces fairly nice-looking tree plots in #6747, and, I might point out, worked great.  For some reason, this was obliterated in #7004 with code that almost does the right thing, but fails to draw the tree crossing-free with high probability.

The easy thing is to add a parameter `shuffle` to `GenericGraph.layout_ranked`, so `GenericGraph.layout_tree` could just call `return self.layout_ranked(heights_dict,shuffle=False)` to avoid the (somewhat baffling) behavior of shuffling the vertices along the heights.  IMHO, the default should be to not shuffle... but the primary focus of this ticket is to fix the damned tree plots.  Again.

My preference is to bring back my code from #6747, since the results are pretty, and I find the "shrink-wrapped" look of layout_ranked to be incomprehensible for large-ish trees.  A good compromise is to add options: layout = "tree", "tree:hang", "tree:shrinkwrap", "tree:circle", etc.

Note to reviewers:  look at the plots produced in the doctests before giving a positive review.

Hellooooooo Frederic !

Looks like your patch does not apply cleanly on 5.10.beta1. This being said, what do you want to achieve with this patch ? What are the bad properties of the current implementation that you want to fix (I really have no idea, I never used that code) ? Do you want the drawing to be planar, for instance (no edge crossings) ?

Oh, and what about using "g.center()" as the root when none is provided ? It should minimize the tree's height.

Yes, the main aim is to have a drawing of a tree without crossings. With the current algorithm, this is not the case

```
g = graphs.RandomTree(80)
g.plot(layout='tree')
```

gives a very messy picture, which does not look like a tree at all.

Thanks for the idea of using the center, I will take care of that as soon as I can do the rebase.

Two questions while I read and try too understand the algorithm.

* Why don't you treat the orientation up/down as you do right/left, i.e. at the end of the algorithm ?

* Why is `obstruction[y] = max(x+1, obstruction[y]) ` not `max(x+dx, obstruction[y])` ? You probably have a nice reason for that, as the plot are very pretty `:-)`
