# Issue 34504: OS X 13: filter out dylib warning

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34741

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-11-11 19:52:20

With OS X 13 and/or Xcode 14, Sage can produce warnings

```
ld: warning: dylib (/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/libec.dylib) was built for newer macOS version (13.0) than being linked (12.3)
```

Let's filter these out when doctesting.

Perhaps needs to add a comment mentioning this ticket (at least the ticket number) to explain why the filter was added.
