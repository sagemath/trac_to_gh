# Issue 11851: doctest of sandpile.py TIMED OUT!, Multiple time hogging testing of same functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12023

Original creator: emil

Original creation time: 2011-11-13 20:11:12

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  ncohen fschulze

Keywords: sandpile, doctest, multible doctests


```
sage -t -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
         [360.2 s] 
```


This doctest runs out of time on my PC. looking inside and doing doctests manually I found that there are 2 function calls which use the bunch of the time


```
S.resolution()
```

and

```
S.betti()
```


those functions are called in several docstrings with similar parameters.

propsed fix is to write a TEST section which test those functions once and flag the other Examples as no test

path to flag certain doctests in sandpile.py as #long time

I wrote a patch where I have flagged the worst offenders in sandpile.py as # test long.
So they will get tested when doing -ptestlong

time for all tests of the module dropped from >360 sec to 55 sec on my machine
cheers

I used `sage -t -timeit` and found some other places that are to blame for most of the runtime. In general the runtime wasn't as bad with the latest (unpatched) alpha anymore for me.
Anyway, if you're ok with these additions, feel free to set it to positive review.

Actually, it did not time out (without the patch) when running the doctests with -verbose here. I will look into this. Probably something else is happening here.

I should add that I work on rather weak machines (well everything is relativ). I have 1 GB RAM and a dual core 2.4 GB processor on my desktop. But I think standard tests shouldn't time out because of that.

On my own machine it works nicely (about 20secs). On another machine that should be much faster it hangs after all the tests have finished according to -verbose output. I'll try to produce some more info to post here.

On a not so old laptop, this file now needs 18s. So, let's just go with the original patch and mark the worst lines as `# long time`? With the changes introduced in the branch it goes down to 7s which seems fine to me.

I agree with the `*firing_graph` doctests as those take over 1.25s on my laptop, and the `show`'s I'm okay with (although those really should be a call to `plot`). The `resolution` takes ~0.7s, which is borderline for me because it is testing functionality. So I'm inclined to not mark that as `# long time`.

Feel free to remove any of the long times for the lines that you would like to have tested every time.
