Hello,

The values from `0` to `99` were already tested in a loop above. And it would be better if the specific value `v=136` is tested alone. See my commit.

Oh, sorry. But instead of this complicated loop with random values and the if to set the modulos right, could you just change the 100 to 400 ? It takes 3 seconds, and is way more systematic and easier to read.

Thanks for the speedup in steiner triple systems.

Actually, I was wrong. The first test checks the function `v_4_1_BIBD` while the second one checks `designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design`. So it is fine to start again from `13`.

Yooooooooo !

Well, I still don't know why you care so much about avoiding 13 BIBD of small size... Nor why you want to have a doctest for 136 right before having a doctest for 13-400.. But WELL, this is fixed `:-D`

Can we set it to `positive review` or is there anything else ???
