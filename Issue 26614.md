# Issue 26614: py3: avoid .vertices() and .edges() in union of graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: py3, graph

This change is not without consequences. Indeed, when adding vertices in the graph `G` resulting from the union of `self` and `other`, the order in which vertices are added to `G` fixes the ordering `list(G)`.

This change breaks the graph generator `EllinghamHorton54Graph` that uses several times `disjoint_union` which itself calls `union`. Also, we change the generator to something simpler and more robust.
