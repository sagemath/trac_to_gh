The Young quasi-Schur basis is described in section 5.2 in http://www.math.ubc.ca/~steph/papers/QuasiSchurBook.pdf .  It is related to the quasi-Schur basis by `YQS(al) = QS(al.reverse()).star_involution()` .

The result that dual-immaculates expands positively in the Young quasi-Schur basis was posted in 2016 and I did not notice that the basis used in the paper wasn't implemented.  I saw a talk by Sarah Mason and took notice when I realized that the quasi-Schurs she was using were different.
