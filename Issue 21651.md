I'm not convinced with removing

```
cp "$SAGE_ROOT"/config/config.* build-aux
```


Givaro uses autotools from 2013, quite outdated:

```
$ local/var/tmp/sage/build/givaro-4.0.2.p0/src/build-aux/config.guess --version
GNU config.guess (2013-06-10)

The `-fPIC` stuff is probably OK, given that `libtool` is used.

Groumpf, I assumed they updated it when releasing the new version...
I'll file a report upstream.

I forgot we had upstream here as well!
