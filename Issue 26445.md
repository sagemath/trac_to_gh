Make the following work:

```
            sage: from sage.groups.misc_gps.argument_groups import SignGroup
            sage: S = SignGroup()
            sage: asymptotic_expansions.SingularityAnalysis(
            ....:     'n', S(-1), alpha=2, beta=1, precision=5,
            ....:     normalized=False)
            n*log(n)*(-1)^n + (euler_gamma - 1)*n*(-1)^n + log(n)*(-1)^n
            + (euler_gamma + 1/2)*(-1)^n + O(n^(-1)*(-1)^n)
```

Reviewed the changes, LGTM. It is very useful to stay in the "smallest" possible `AsymptoticRing` by default when calling `SingularityAnalysis`.

Conditional `positive_review`, depending on the output of the patchbot.

For the next time: it would be good to fix the pyflakes warnings, as suggested by the patchbot.

I am very sorry. Cleanup-ticket at #27759.
