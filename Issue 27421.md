Keywords: differential forms, manifolds

In Sage 8.8.beta1, as well as in Sage 8.6 and 8.7, we have

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x)
sage: f in M.diff_form_module(0)  # OK
True
sage: f in M.diff_form_module(1)  # Bang!
...
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```
