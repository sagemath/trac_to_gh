It is possible to provide links to e.g. sagenb docs there, by putting in full paths to the corresponding files.

Unfortunately Sphinx does not seem to provide a way to template data like `$SAGE_LOCAL`, so we probably will need to have `index.rst.in` filled in by configure.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27495

I don't know why it has taken so long to get started with this, to link together all these loose spkg docs in SAGE_LOCAL - something one might not even notice otherwise.

At least now SageNB docs are nicely linked - and available as HTML, in particular this will be there on the website, I suppose.

Let's get it in quickly, and add more on a followup ticket.

It seems to be a tall order to harmonise naming schemes and locations for docs of all the Sage packages. 

I'd rather take what each package provides and in spkg-configure.m4 record this location into a variable (perhaps if the package is not built, but a system version used, then no doc link needs to be generated at all).

Another important reason for having this is that authors of external packages sometimes are annoyed by Sage incorporating their work silently. This showing/linking of docs will make it less silent...

Why? What's wrong with doing it at configuration time?
Should we redo the whole Sage building process with Python only? :-)

Mind you, Python does not have tools for this, autoconf does, as you see.

That, you see, is the result of conflating "sage the distribution" with "sage the software". A confusion made easier by the fact that sage the software is not distributed as a proper package like the rest of its dependencies. The top configure is really mostly for sage the distribution and mingling the top level configure to stuff in sage the software means that you are not wanting sage the software to be pip installable ever.

Yes I am aware that what you are thinking of is easy with autotools but not trivial with python. But sometimes doing the easy stuff is just painting yourself in a corner in the long run.

individual packages have their own ideas where the docs should go. Mostly it is
either `/usr/share/$PKG/doc` or `/usr/share/doc/$PKG`, but not always. E.g. `cmake` puts docs in `$prefix/doc`. They also don't always have a topmost `index.html`, or quite often only provide pdf docs. Some probably have it configurable, some (most?) probably not.

It is not really so, as the top level reference manual already has things that are not about `sagelib`, e.g. some of it are to be in the development manual.

I agree though that it's desirable to add one more level to Sage distro docs, something akin to

It's a search-and-replace; I think Python can handle it. Google led me to this, for example, for a generic search-and-replace:

```
import fileinput

for line in fileinput.FileInput(filename, inplace=True):
    print(line.replace(text_to_search, replacement_text))
```

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

Are you expecting to apply the substitutions in files other than `reference/index.rst`? As it stands, the Python file `reference/conf.py` already imports `SAGE_DOC` (for example) from `sage.env`, so it can surely do the same with `SAGE_SHARE`. What makes changing "`@`SAGE_SHARE`@`" to the value of the appropriate variable configuration rather than installation? It seems to me that the configuration part is putting "`@`SAGE_SHARE`@`" in the file to begin with. At that point, people can make sure that the appropriate variables are set how they want before they build and install the docs.

Sorry, I should have added more context. I expect to  generate contents of the substitution patterns per package, in `spkg-configure.m4`. It might be that the package isn't even installed, then the contents would contain a pointer to an external URL.

As I say above, for some packages it might boil down to writing an external URL somewhere into index.rst, with the package itself not even installed. Surely, doing this substitution at installation rather than at configuration would make the whole thing even more complicated than it already is.

Sorry, I'm wrong about this, but I was confused because Sage sets the environment variable `SAGE_DOC` to be `SAGE_SHARE/doc/sage`, and that's not how you define it: you don't include the `sage` at the end. So it would be best to not use `SAGE_DOC` as you are. Please either use ``@`SAGE_SHARE`@`/doc` (my preference) or invent a new variable (we have enough already, I think).

It works for me with OS X and Python 3. I'm not sure what you mean by "`.replace` cannot do more than one pattern per line":

```
$ sage
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

Maybe the timestamps of `index.rst` or `index.rst.in` are off: if `index.rst` is newer, it won't get overwritten. Try `touch index.rst.in`: does that help?

At configure time at the moment the only way to get Maxima version is to parse `build/pkgs/maxima/package-version.txt` (the 1st X.Y.Z are the version)
in `build/pkgs/maxima/spkg-configure.m4`.

As we go on with adding capabilites to use system packages, we'd be able to call instead `maxima --version` to get it.

So this is doable, but is more work than after Sage is built.

Me and my distro buddies think otherwise. I think we would prefer nothing than the current state of this ticket. 

I approve doing it in python rather than `configure` - my opinion on `configure` for sage is well known.

I am not sure about running things from `doc/en/reference/conf.py`. May be one day we'll have translation of the reference manual in other languages, we may think again about it then.

It may be easier on distro if you were assembling a single string to replace. Then we could replace with our own more easily.

So you think we should include a link to local Maxima documentation?

Or don't include it?

Since it's modifying the file `doc/en/reference/index.rst`, it seems like an appropriate place. If we ever have translations of the reference manual, we will have to rethink `doc/en/reference/conf.py` in other ways, too. So I think it's okay to do the work in this file.

If I omit local Maxima documentation, the only replacement would be of the string ``@`SAGE_SHARE`@``.

So what exactly are you requesting?

From the distro point of view, I don't care either way. From the sage point of view, it is a nice to have.

Not in a way that relies on a regular vanilla sage layout. It has no future if sage ever becomes a pip installable package. It has to be smarter and to not rely on preconceptions. I admit that it is harder. Connecting the data parts of two separate packages whatever happens with the packaging is very hard and need forethought.

Apart from giving in my tantrum to use the output of `maxima -d` (thanks maxima devs to give me tools to know about your install, that's good forethought). I am suggesting creating a string in `conf.py` and replacing a single value ``@`MAXIMA_HTLM_DOC_DIR`@`` in `index.rst`. That way I can replace/patch with something appropriate in `conf.py` much more easily.

I'll look to see how hard it would be to use `maxima -d`.

Note that when I was talking about forethought here, the last problem is that once installed, `sage`'s documentation is static. If you change something in the maxima install the link is likely to break. There is no real solution to that, apart linking to some place on the web and pray it stays there for the life of the deployments.

this ticket has nothing to do with maxima or singular documentation being installed
by Sage, or not. It merely creates links to these docs in the top level of Sage reference manual (hey, Sage should document its components!)

A solution I proposed at the start of this ticket was to create the correct links to docs at configure time. Then already installed Sage components could be analysed and correct links created in a, hopefully, platform/distro-independent way.  

I was told that many distros are allergic to `./configure`, and John cooked up something supposedly better for distros, in pure !Python/Sage, the current branch. 

One of the main purposes of this ticket was to improve doc.sagemath.org, to provide it with these links. I feel this has gone totally in a direction I did not intend.

If this ticket is useless for distros in its present form then I don't see a reason to do the task at hand with !Python/Sage, it's a wrong tool IMHO.
(It is configuring things, and we have `./configure` for this task.)

It should have nothing to do with that, but in its current state it assumes that they are sage-installed or at least at the location they would be if they were sage-installed.

Its pure Python/Sage, but not configurable. That is not better. The ideal solution would not need any configuration (determining the correct paths programmatically). The next best solution would allow configuration in some way (through environment variables, an easily-patchable file, etc.). The least good (for distros) solution doesn't allow any configuration.

The easiest solution is to just add links to the web page for the appropriate piece of software. For example the page https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php/singular-manual.html might be pretty stable, whereas I have no idea how to find local Singular documentation programmatically.

(The disadvantage to this is that there will often be version mismatches between what Sage is using and the most up-to-date version.)
