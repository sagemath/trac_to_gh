# Issue 690: VMware sage doesn't allow creation of files

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/690

I could be mistaken, but running sage under VMware on a Windows machine (e.g. for a huge DSage project) won't allow the creation of a file.  If you log in under manage, you are not given the permissions to create a file!

Type "sudo su".

I would suggest we add a question the the FAQ and then close this ticker.

Cheers,
