# Issue 22715: Trivial failure in py3_syntax test

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2017-05-05 16:33:27

The test from #22357 fails if the test suit is run from outside SAGE_ROOT:


```
sage -t --long /opt/sage/src/sage/tests/py3_syntax.py
**********************************************************************
File "/opt/sage/src/sage/tests/py3_syntax.py", line 79, in sage.tests.py3_syntax.SortedDirectoryWalkerABC.__iter__
Failed example:
    next(iter(test))
Expected:
    ('src/sage/tests/french_book', 'README', '')
Got:
    ('../../opt/sage/src/sage/tests/french_book', 'README', '')
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   4 in sage.tests.py3_syntax.SortedDirectoryWalkerABC.__iter__
    [29 tests, 1 failure, 12.77 s]
```


Obviously the test just needs some ellipses.
