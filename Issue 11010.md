We have a function order_of_vanishing  on p-adic L-functions with docstring:

-------------
Definition:     L.order_of_vanishing(self)
Source:
   def order_of_vanishing(self):
       r"""
       Return the order of vanishing of this `p`-adic L-series.

       The output of this function is provably correct, due to a
       theorem of Kato [Ka].  This function will terminate if and only if
       the Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum analogue [MTT] of the BSD conjecture about
       the rank of the curve is true and the subgroup of elements of
       `p`-power order in the Tate-Shafarevich group of this curve is
       finite.  I.e. if this function terminates (with no errors!),
       then you may conclude that the `p`-adic BSD rank conjecture is
       true and that the `p`-part of Sha is finite.

-------------

The actual code doesn't call p-adic regulator anywhere.  However, in
our paper we claim that not only does
one have to verify that the order of vanishing of the analytic p-adic
L-function equals the rank of the curve,
but one also needs that the p-adic regulator is nonzero, in order to
get the claimed conclusion that Sha is finite.
That makes sense to me, since I don't think Schneider gets anywhere
without knowing the height pairing
is nondegenerate.

So... is this a bug... I guess only in the documentation.  We could
simply add to the documentation that if
you call this function, get a number, and then *also* call
padic_regulator and get a nonzero number, then
you can conclude that Sha(p) is finite.

I agree that the documentation is wrong. I would simply delete to
mention Sha at all. This is probably better explained in p_primary
bound. So a reference to this function could be included.

The attached patch is ready for review.  It does *nothing* but changed the docstring for the order_of_vanishing function, by deleting the offending and incorrect paragraph, and a related incorrect doctest.  I also added a rank 2 and rank 3 doctest to replace having deleted a rank 2 doctest.

It turns out that we were confused.  However, I think the ticket should still go in as is, since it's well... confusing have theorems without references stated left and right in docstrings.

Ooops, yes everything you say is correct. And I agree with your
conclusion. The confusion is all mine, sorry. It is a long time I have
not thought about shark.

The finiteness of Sha comes indeed very easily and without having to
compute p-adic regulators. But I still think that the possibility of
computing the order is the great thing. We can prove Hasse principles
for curves, without having to compute any Galois cohomology groups.
