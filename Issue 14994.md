```
sage: P1 = toric_varieties.P1()
sage: D = -P1.K()
sage: D.Kodaira_map()
Scheme morphism:
  From: 1-d CPR-Fano toric variety covered by 2 affine patches
  To:   Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field defined by:
  -x1^2 + x0*x2
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending [s : t] to
        (t^2 : s*t : s^2)
```

Hi Volker,

I had a look at the patch and changed a couple of things:
- Docstring: 'If the divisor is ample then this is an embedding.' - Is that really true? An ample toric divisor is very ample iff the toric variety is smooth or its dimension <=2, see e.g. Cox 6.1.10.
- I think it would be a good idea if the method Kodaira_map() checked that the line bundle corresponding to the divisor has at least a section, otherwise one receives exception that one cannot create `P^-1`. That is of course due to the same, but more confusing, at least to me.
- The optional parameter names was not working.

Would you be okay with that? I don't know whether I raised the correct kind of exception. If everything is okay, then it's a positive review from me.

Best,
Jan
