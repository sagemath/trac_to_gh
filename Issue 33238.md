It's much better this way, thank you. It's not perfect but it probably will never be without actually parsing the LaTeX: a page like https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithgroup/index.html will still end up with a title `{rm SL}_2{{bf Z}}`. Actually it would be better if whoever originally wrote that had defined a macro `\SL` and also used the existing macro `\ZZ`.

In the big change in layout.html (when I view the branch here), is it a change in indentation or is there an actual difference in content?

Right.

> a page like https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithgroup/index.html will still end up with a title `{rm SL}_2{{bf Z}}`. Actually it would be better if whoever originally wrote that had defined a macro `\SL` and also used the existing macro `\ZZ`.

While solving this, I ended up in adding new macros `\SL` and `\PSL`.

They are all just indentation changes to align them up.

As before, I think it looks great. Do you want to keep tinkering, fixing small issues, or should we merge it and move on? By "small issues," I mean that if I visit the local version of ​https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/arithgroup/index.html, then the title bar says "Arithmetic Subgroups of SL_2(ZZ) — Arithmetic Subgroups of $SL_2(ZZ)$", and similarly when I follow links from that page. I don't know where the dollar signs are coming from, and I don't know if it's worth tracking down. (That's the only type of issue I've seen so far.)

I don't know either. But those `$` dollars should have been removed. The last commit would fix the error. 

I have no more things to do. Thanks for reviewing.
