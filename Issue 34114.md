Another way to define L would be:

```
    L = ("014 018 023 027 036 049 056 05b 07a 08a 09b 125 126 137 139"
         "147 15a 16b 18b 19a 23b 248 24a 258 269 279 2ab 345 34b 35a"
         "367 389 38a 459 46a 46b 478 568 579 57b 67a 689 78b 9ab"
        ).split()
```

but I'm fine either way and I agree with the positive review.
