It is allowed to use dollar signs in the documentation to denote math stuff. It is also supposed to be possible to escape them like `\$` to get plain dollars. When I put, say, "There are \$10 and \$5 bills." in a module docstring and build documentation, the text between dollars is in math mode. The same seems to happen with introspection. The source code does show $'s without anything, but it seems that they get caught by MathJax during rendering.

This should not happen: either MathJax should leave $'s alone, or they have to be escaped somehow again (automatically, so that `\$` works in the source file).

Sage version: 5.6.beta1.

Hi John,

Could you take a look at it? I think I finally understood what's going on after a few hours, but I don't know how to proceed about fixing it.

Thank you!
Andrey
