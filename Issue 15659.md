# Issue 15659: integration of polynomials in several variables is buggy

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: chapoton

Keywords: integration of polynomials

Here is the problem:

```
sage: x,y=polygen(QQ,'x,y')
sage: x.integral(x)
1/2*x^2
sage: x.integral(x).parent()
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: x.integral(x)+y
BOOM
```

A more specific commit message would not be unwelcome `:-)`

Euh, well, bon, ok.

I have changed my own bad code (which was mixing different sorts of multivariate polynomials) to something with more cython, which is staying in the singular multivariate polynomials.

This is an important bug, in my humble opinion. Could someone please have a look ?

Changing keywords from "integration of polynomials" to "integration of polynomials, bug".

Looks good (to the Singular-untrained eye, admittedly) and the patchbot is happy.
