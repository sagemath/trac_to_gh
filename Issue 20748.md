Would one of you be so kind as to have a quick look at this ticket of mine ?

The subject is quite specialized, but the experts do not seem concerned, so I have to turn to other people.

Uh. "- - as explained in", and then a link to a paper written in French.

Seems interesting, but would propably take time to understand. I can not promise anything.

I don't see a reason to have the `son` function. I would directly inline the appropriate case in `extract_tree`.

Thank you, Travis, for this useful remark. I have streamlined the code.

`@`jmantysalo, I do not expect a full mathematical review here, but maybe just a check that the code is written efficiently enough, does what it is expected to do in the doctests, and can safely enter sage.

The main idea is to use some kind of "canonical drawing" of binary trees, as already implemented in the "to_tilting" method of binary trees. Then one superposes two such drawings, and cut at the superposition points.
