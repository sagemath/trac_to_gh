Keywords: elliptic curves, isogenies, mutability

Right now, isogenies of elliptic curves are *slightly* mutable:
The three methods `switch_sign`, `set_post_isomorphism`, and `set_pre_isomorphism` all modify `self`.

As usual, this alone already causes bugs because it breaks hashing:


```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(431), [1,0])
sage: phi = E.isogeny(E.lift_x(277))
sage: my_isogenies = {phi}
sage: iso = phi.codomain().isomorphism_to(phi.codomain().change_weierstrass_model(1,2,3,4))
sage: phi.set_post_isomorphism(iso)
sage: phi in my_isogenies
False
sage: phi in list(my_isogenies)
True
```


The bigger issue is that it breaks other constructions that use `EllipticCurveIsogenies` as a building block: The easiest example is the existing `FormalCompositeMap` we already get from composing two isogenies. Mutability means that the factors of the map can be changed after the composition has been constructed, with weird and buggy results:


```sage
sage: psi = E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(2)
sage: f = phi * psi
sage: f(E(0,0))
(0 : 1 : 0)
sage: iso = phi.domain().change_weierstrass_model(1,2,3,4).isomorphism_to(phi.domain())
sage: psi.set_pre_isomorphism(iso)
sage: f(E(0,0))
# ...
TypeError: Coordinates [11, 145, 1] do not define a point on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field of size 431
sage: f.domain()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field of size 431
sage: f[0].domain()
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + 6*x*y + 8*y = x^3 + 428*x^2 + 420*x + 425 over Finite Field of size 431
```

Thanks to those who have been working on this and related tickets.  I have just been looking at the threads after returning from holiday and am happy with what is being proposed.

The issue regarding normalization of isogenies is almost entirely restricted to isogenies over finite fields, where it is easy to achieve by changing the model used for the domain or codomain, but is almost irrelevant for isogenies over Q and other number fields, which I have done most with (and use most), where you often have few units around to scale modles by, and do not care whether the isogenies are normalised.

Secondly, composing with isomorphisms in general is used a lot in the code I wrote for compstructing isogenies over number fields, where there's a generic formula for short Weiertstrass equations but one want an isogeny between other (say minimal) models.  In particular, pre- and post-composing by automorphisms was implemented the way it is (I seem to remember) by the original implemented, who worked over finite fields, and added some features at my request before the first versions of all this were merged years ago.
