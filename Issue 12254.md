The problem is the import_array statement from `numpy`, more precisely this bit of code from `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy/__multiarray_api.h`

```
#if PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x03000000
#define NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL NULL
#else
#define NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL
#endif

#define import_array() {if (_import_array() < 0) {PyErr_Print(); PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ImportError, "numpy.core.multiarray failed to import"); return NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL; } }
```

As you can see for `python` < 3 `NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL` is defined but empty, therefore the return statement in `import_array` is empty. This is completely and mainly rely on `gcc` to be permissive. `NULL` is not necessarily a good return value either, since it should be an error code. The whole thing assume or impose something on the part of the function calling `import_array` that is not true in `time_series` an I am not sure can be imposed in `cython` (don't know enough about cython).

A quick and dirty solution is to edit `_multiarray.py` and make `NUMPY_IMPORT_ARRAY_RETVAL` `NULL` always. That get us to the next problem.

I am not sure what to do with that one. I'll just note line 257 is the one enabled by `__GNUC__`

```
#ifndef CYTHON_INLINE
  #if defined(__GNUC__)
    #define CYTHON_INLINE __inline__

```

So `clang` pretending to be `gcc` means that `CYTHON_INLINE` is defined. Of course `clang` support the GNU form, but it doesn't support a declaration to be inlined as it is in that code. This is clearly a `cython` code generation issue.

That's a genuine problem with the Sage code. GCC only warns for this (which is actually surprising, since the code makes no sense). Ideally, Cython should already refuse this code instead of generating invalid C.

The fix is easy: remove `inline` from all **declarations** in `.pxd` files.

After this, I can create a working sage instance by doing `./sage --pip install ipython`, which pulls `pyzmq-16.0.2`, and all gets installed nicely.
(there is too much clever AI behind compiler recongnition in Sage's instance of `pyzmq` - perhaps we should upgrade?)

Running tests now (using `./sage -tp`)

Note that `pynac` fix I proposed on #21701 is not needed here, so it's just an older `clang` on OSX, it seems.

There is one segfault related to `brial` to investigate. A lot of plotting fail a specific comparison and there is a strange problem with `fplll`

```
        from fpylll import LLL, IntegerMatrix

I am guessing the symbol is not in the "flat namespace".
That warning happens a lot in plots:

I've installed libc++, and while rebuilding from scratch using it, hit a bug in linbox:
(in `linbox/field/gf2.h`)

```
#if !defined(__PATHCC__) && !(defined(__APPLE__) && defined(__clang__))
#define stdBitReference std::_Bit_reference
#else
#define stdBitReference std::vector<bool>::reference
#endif
```

that appears to assume that clang not on OSX much be using libstdc++.

By the way, I am still using low-level gcc ABI, e.g. this is a typical ldd output on a C++ library (notice `libgcc_s.so` there):

```

What is the replacement of `libgcc_s`? `compiler-rt` or `libcxxabi`?      
It is probably due to me using clang-3.9 rather than clang-9999 that it uses `libgcc_s`.

This is https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585 (an 11-year old bug!)

they say it is enhancement. Technically speaking, building C++ extensions is just not supported...
We should just switch to Julia :-)

Anyhow, I suppose the problem I face is that clang has no idea about STL library implementation it should use (well, clang++ does have an appropriate flag (-stdlib=),
clang probably just ignores such a flag). It's just an accident that it works with gcc.

Not really because `gcc` looks at the extension of the file to be compiled and decides what to do depending on that. If you compile a `.cpp` file with `gcc`, I guess it behaves exactly the same as compiling that file with `g++`. Doesn't `clang` do the same?

`__bit_reference` is a header file from `libc++`; which `clang++` finds as I invoke it as `clang++ -stdlib=libc++`. But `clang` has no idea about this parameter, and thus it cannot find it. It is probably not simply including the corresponding directory with -I parameter, as more things from STL are most probably have to be included by default.

I am not sure. By the way, the file in question, where the error pops up, (`local/include/linbox/fields/gf2.h`) is a C++ file, but is has extension `.h`, indicating plain C file, I think. (well, it is included from a `.cpp` file, so in that sense it is meant to be C++).

Besides, `g++` has parameters that `gcc` does not have, such as `-nostdinc++` (needed if you want use an STL implementation different from `libstdc++`), and so I don't see how this could at all fly with `gcc` if these `g++`-only parmeters are to be invoked.

Well, `gcc` and `clang` are not the real compilers, they are drivers. In the case of gcc the real compiler is `cc1` for example.

So for example, while it is possible to produce a `.o` with gcc from a C++ source (and same with clang if you are lucky) it is impossible to link a C++ program with gcc/clang instead of g++/clang++ (without extra manual flags that is) because only the C++ driver knows to add the right flags for the standard C++ library.

I notice for example that `matrix_modn_dense_float.cpp` is compiled with clang on OS X but the .so file is linked with clang++.

Not sure if anyone has such resources in the open; indeed, it's illegal to run OSX on non-Apple hardware, although the net is full of instructions on how to e.g. hack VMWarePlayer to make it run OSX on non-Apple hardware.

I'm thinking that perhaps resurrecting FreeBSD port, which as of version 10 has clang as the default toolchain, is the best bet for a platform on which port to clang can be completed without extra hassles.

A lot of these are related to elliptic curves, more precisely, to eclib interface with sage. This seems to be the 3rd group of errors.

I'll see the author of fplll in few days here in Oxford, perhaps we can have a look.

OK, I had to ask. Now that `fplll` is sorted, things are clearer. We have 

* `polybori` segfaulting,
* missing symbols in `pynac` - I will get in touch upstream,
* issues with `matplotlib`, although it could be interaction with sage types.
* similarly an issue in `numpy`.
* a tolerance problem in `lseries_ell.py`, the doctest look at a zero value within 1e-17, but we are only 2e-16 of it.

For clang++, do you use libc++, as OSX does, rather than libstdc++, as a non-bleeding-edge clang-on-Linux would use the latter...
(having clang++/libc++ on Linux looked like a very experimental thing to me; without libc++ some C++-specific thing are rather different)

how about `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`? Is this not enough?

It assumes that you are using the same vendor for CC and CXX. Mixing those would probably trigger an error in configure unless the gnu compiler you are trying to mix with clang is version 4.2.1 precisely.

On OS X where there is no fortran compiler by default, gcc would still be build and the `sage-env` hack necessary. But you should be able to bring an external gfortran and skip the building of the toolchain.

You can simplify `test "x$IS_CLANG" = "xno"` to `test "$IS_CLANG" = no` or even `test $IS_CLANG = no` if you know that `$IS_CLANG` is one word :-)

I think it would be more logical to test `AX_COMPILER_VENDOR()` earlier, when you are actually testing the C++ compiler.

For Fortran, maybe just drop the version check altogether? If clang works with gfortran, then I would guess that gcc/g++ also work with different versions of gfortran.

Yes, it went through several iterations before I figured out that I was trying to check the vendor of the fortran compiler :( [which is unknown because the macro only knows how to do C and C++ compilers].

Yes it would make sense.

Most likely. I would imagine that if it doesn't it is actually broken.

```

As it turns out this bit

```
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"' -DSYS_DEFAULT_PATHS=\"'"$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest"'\"'
```

about `SYS_DEFAULT_PATHS` is breaking the detection of `-fPIC -DPIC` by autoconf, so everything is compiled without `-fPIC` and the linking of the shared object fails.

At this point I think 
1. if it is useful make it a configuration option
2. I don't any of that in sage-on-gentoo. Is this really necessary? I guess I'll figure the answer to that shortly.

I know I said I wouldn't provide a branch, but all in all we are closer to clang support out of the box than I thought we were last week.

I would have thought that you would bring your fortran compiler on freeBSD. That part is only really activated if you compile gcc, which is only necessary if you don't already have a gfortran install.

Anything more complicated should indeed be the object of a configuration.

Are you sure that it's impossible to just install `gfortran` without `gcc` and `g++`?

That would be the best solution: don't install `gcc` and `g++` at all if `clang` is available. Then you would need less special cases in `sage-env`.

It is exciting to see this progress, and it is exciting to have the `gcc` build take only 7 minutes on my Mac, since it only has to build fortran.

I don't know that we have. But moving to clang on OS X just makes sense. We had to include numerous work around for gcc itself, and some package are already compiled with clang on a case by case basis. This is because we will continue having problems with gcc until either
* gcc adopt the same extensions as clang

Neither is happening anytime soon as far as I am aware. It is increasingly difficult to build a big project on OS X with gcc/g++. The general mood is to just bite the bullet and move to clang.

Internet has benchmarking stuff for clang vs gcc, in particular as far as HPC things are concerned. Give or take, they are largely on par.

The test passed for me without any changes on a different machine, so it is intermittent.  We should probably make this change anyway. See #22837. (I've made you the author and me the reviewer.)

That's my complete list of failed test suites. Summarizing: `clang`-only failures for:

- `giac`
- `cysignals`
Failures with both `clang` and `gcc`:

- `gf2x` and `ntl` (related?)
- `zeromq`: intermittent, perhaps addressed at #22837 although I haven't tested thoroughly to see if that completely fixes the problem
- `cython`: #22166

Oh, and I forgot to mention: `python3` – does any python package ever pass its test suite with Sage?

I just had some "fun" debugging this. Turns out it is a 9-year old(!) LLVM bug: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=965

There is a work-around in #22691.

With this branch, if a user on OS X happens to have installed gcc (for example, version 5.4.0 in `/usr/local/bin`), then those packages will break if you use that version of `gcc` to compile them. So if here or on a followup ticket, we are hoping to simplify the logic in some of the `spkg-install` scripts, we have to be careful. We either need to keep the parts of the script that say

or we need to force the user to compile everything with clang even if they have a good version of gcc installed.

Of course the very curious bit here is that `libz.so` has been built instead of `libz.dylib` and it doesn't have the proper `install_name` set which leads to the problem. So the real problem is that `zlib` is built funny when the compiler is set to `cc`. I expect it doesn't use autotools....

A little word about future plans to finish this now that #22799 seems to have a solution.

* It is now possible to build, and doctest sage itself on OS X with clang building only gfortran with this ticket.
* Similarly on FreeBSD.
* To build with clang on linux we need to patch python (both 2.7 and 3.x) for http://bugs.python.org/issue25229 for which I should make a ticket.
* Further on linux which usually default to gcc we want something like #22646, otherwise you have to run sage like `CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./sage` if you want to avoid problems like the one described at #22678.
* Some packages do not pass their test suite with clang. 

After much thinking, while I think the default on OS X should be to use clang, I don't think we should preclude building with gcc, especially if people bring their own gcc. So far the only problems we have seen are in C code. Not C++ and after reflexion I don't think it is going to change. So building with gcc/g++ with clang exception for key packages should work. But apart from those, I think the support for gcc on OS X should become minimal over time. 

You could even imagine doing some compile with gcc/clang++/gfortran or clang/g++/gfortran so long as we fix python use of the C compiler to compile C++ code. https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585

So the plan forward: 
* Fix package testsuite as much as possible - sometimes it will be hard. `eclib`'s tests need to learn about tolerance for example.
* Base future work on #22646
* Make the building of gfortran only, more generic. That is, not relying on a variable telling you the compiler is clang. For that matter we can try to extend this to the case where the platform already has a gcc/g++ compiler but only lacks a fortran compiler. But in a general manner not exposing to the rest of the system that you are not using gcc by a variable like `IS_CLANG`.

Well autotools finds a compiler that works. You can over-ride that by parameters. Note that #22646 makes that choice of compiler stick to runtime unless sage builds its own.

Autotools is system based on testing and finding capabilities of what you have rather than sticking to a brand. Which is what you should wish for. That being said if you don't set `CC`, `AC_PROG_C` will go through a default list (which you can override). On OS X, with the current branch it finds Apple's `gcc` which is really `clang` and everything is fine.

As far as I am concerned doing `CC=.. ./configure..` is not very different to doing something like `./configure --with-c-compiler=...`.

But we could be enforcing things more at the `AC_PROG_{C,CXX,FC}` point and even do it by OS. On linux only look for gcc and clang in that order, on OS X and freebsd look for clang and gcc in that order. That's bit harsh but can still be discarded in the event you set `CC` (I think).

> Whatever happens, we need to be careful not to build certain packages on OS X using gcc: in my experience, with Sage's gcc or my own, some packages (like python and R) fail, but they succeed using clang.

Yes, I think we'll still make sure the packages that needs clang on OS X gets it enforced at the `spkg-install` level.

> I guess we could let the user shoot themselves in the foot by explicitly setting `CC` etc., but the default settings should work whether or not there is a recent version of `gcc` in `/usr/local/bin`, for example.

Yes. By default it should take a well supported configuration for the platform. But users should be free to shoot themselves in the foot - best way to learn things, really.

 Maybe my version of gcc is broken. Any other ideas of what could be wrong?

I had always assumed people would start from a tarball so yes I will add instructions shortly. If we go that route the gfortran folder in the upstream repo should link to the gcc one.

`@` jhpalmieri That an external gcc-5.4.0 works is great news.

(this link is to the corresponding trivial commit from #22679)

It looks as if it's the only thing needed on top of the branch here to build on freebsd

Gentoo but I am still on clang-3.9.1.

There are indeed some issues with eclib. Apart from the tolerance issue one the test executable segfault for an unclear reason in a C++ header from clang's libstdc++. The issue doesn't appear to exist on OS X - where xcode is based on clang 3.8. eclib could gain to completely switch to c++11. It wouldn't fix all the issues but it would come out cleaner. The issues in eclib don't prevent sage test suite to fully pass.

giac, yes lots of warnings but apart from the funny test where the order of the solution flip between gcc and clang everything passes. I must say that I already have a bad taste in my mouth from hash_map/unordered_map in brial. I think hash_map should get the cold shoulder.

Now for something a little bit different. The branch in its current form will let you try to compile sage with the intel compiler (C/C++ not fortran). So far I only needed two fixes aside from the one already needed for clang. sqlite (because icc fakes gcc too much and sqlite didn't think of it) and openblas (known issue fixed in master but that missed the 0.2.19 release).

Unintentionally, I built with `-stdlib=libstdc++`; apparently in my configuration
I need an explicit `-stdlib=libc++` in CXXFLAGS.

Anyhow, ptestlong fails just one doctest, due to numerical noise:

```
File "src/sage/libs/lcalc/lcalc_Lfunction.pyx", line 188, in sage.libs.lcalc.lcalc_Lfunction.Lfunction.hardy_z_function

Got:
    0.793967590477206 - 4.03312243040125e-17*I
```


I'd say this configuration is good to go. I'll test with `-stdlib=libc++`, too.
I guess some GNUisms might pop up...

Yes, this is a good idea.

Yes, this is my `icc` build. I think it deserves a separate numerical noise ticket.

On Linux clang 4.0.1 with libc++ gives a weird linking error on gfan (another old C++ worry).

It took me a while to notice that `CXXFLAGS` is not used during compilation of C++.
(and in my setup `-stdlib=libc++` is not the default, the default is `libstdc++`, so
CXXFLAGS are really needed!)
It's an error in gfan's makefile that somehow went unnoticed. The following (a patch to Sage's patch :-)) fixes it:

Dima has a fair point about dependency on gfortran. But the only dependency needed is for blas since all the package needing fortran need it for lapack.

I noticed that the optional package boost does not build ob FreeBSD, and gets built with gcc on Linux/clang/libc++ even if CC and CXX are specified.

It seems we need to fix `spkg-install` there to use `--toolset $CC` option.
As well, passing `-std=...`  has to be done explicitly, it seems; does this mean that the toplevel Sage configure also needs something like `CXXLIB=` option.

`clang` is not a defined toolset, may be we'd end up with darwin (no), it should probably piggy back on gcc. May be we need an update to boost. We could possibly leave the toolset as gcc for now and use a `user-config.jam` file with our settings. 

It must already do funny things on OS X since in the absence of toolset, `darwin` is used and probably default to clang (unless they are counting on gcc to be clang, it is not impossible considering the rest of the mess).

The build system is complex and dealing with it in a systematic way for other vendor (say intel) is difficult.

the spkg-install of gfortran package is too dumb to know this, and 
without gfortran or gcc, and CC set to clang this ends up in an error downloading a non-existent tarball...

1. Replace

```

fi
```

by

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/gcc ]; then

2. First doing `cd src` and then immediately `cd ..` is silly: drop that.

```
# Force re-configuration: the next time that "make" is run, we don't

cd "$SAGE_SPKG_INST"

There are many clangs around. I think the one that does not work with lcalc is clang 4.x.y, for some ranges of x and y. clang 5.0.0 does compile the current clang, and it did work with clang 3.u.v for some u and v, as well.

And there is also an issue of the standard C++ library, libstdc++ (from GCC project) vs libc++ (from Clang project); they differ quite a bit. libstdc++ with clang seems to be a deadly mix...

Oh, and there also different runtime libs on Linux that may be used...

Tricky. Change in gcc version may or may not be accompanied by incompatible changes in fortran runtime.

From https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran/News it appears all the versions from 4.9.1 are fully ABI compatible (although `.mod` files have changed at gcc-5 but we don't have any of those I think) so far.

Putting this back in `needs review`. It is a bit late for sage 8.1 I think, but if I think everything is in place for it to be usable and merged at the beginning of 8.2.

The biggest obstacles are the failing testsuite of `eclib` and `giac`. I should check the new `giac-1.4.x` series, may be the flipping behavior has been fixed - the patch for pari over 2.7 is not needed in that version (admittedly I didn't check compiling against pari 2.7, they may just have changed what they are compiling against internally and fixed accordingly).

Of course we should. Doctests shouldn't fail.

Yes. Some of it is still numerical noise plus sign flip-flopping.

That was for supporting "new" systems for which there was previously no support. Here, we are talking about changing things for a system on which Sage already "passes tests". So going from "passes tests" to "builds" would be a regression.

as well, as long as clang is not the default way to build Sage on a system, one should not insist on passing all the tests on this system, right?

You are quite correct. In fact this is better/worse than that. Any compiler C/C++ compiler that is properly detected by `AC_PROG_CC` and `AC_PROG_CXX` and sets the autoconf variable `GCC` to yes, can and will be used. It could be limited to clang but I think it is better to open up a bit. Other compilers are not the default on "normal" systems.

So, in the absence of a working gcc/g++, if clang/clang++ is present and working, it will be used. In the case of OS X where `/usr/bin/gcc` is a wrapper to clang, it will be used. Unless someone overrides it.

Unless the variables CC/CXX are set, gcc will be tested first. Because of the fact on OS X, xcode installs `usr/bin/gcc` that means changing the default on OS X that's absolutely correct.

That and the fact that building gcc is probably the package that take the longest to build on OS X.

I make no bones or apologies about the fact that this ticket makes clang the default on OS X.

I am updating the description and title. Also I think the ticket is not "meta" anymore.

The status is doctests pass and all standard packages' testsuite pass except for two (one with an extra ticket). Is it good enough to change the default now? My impression is that the people using OS X are quite happy with the deal but it will trigger buildbot failures unless we do something about `eclib`'s testsuite.

OK, the latter problem is that the gcc build was still loaded via `configure.ac`'s

```
AS_ECHO_N(>&7 ['TOOLCHAIN = $(inst_gcc)'])

and this got through into the build system.

-------------

It looks as if either the `TOOLCHAIN` business is obsolete and ought to be removed, or it needs to be updated
to the case of the use of clang (i.e. it would be `'TOOLCHAIN = $(inst_gfortran)'`).
(I don't know its purpose anyway, and it does not seem to be documented).

I checked the `TOOLCHAIN` business and I believe it is all correct. `TOOLCHAIN` can be set to `$(inst_gcc)` only when gcc needs to be built - if you use ccache, I think it is added there too. If it is still set when gcc doesn't need to be built there is definitely a bug somewhere in the configure script. Are you sure you have run `./bootstrap` before configuring?

OK, so configure tarball was the culprit. Once I installed autotools out of the tree, 
while using the system-provided m4, I was able to run `./bootstrap`, and build with clang just fine.

Sage's autotools package is broken: it tries building its own `m4`, but it does not work:

```
bash-3.2$ ls -l local/bin/m4
-rwxr-xr-x  1 dimpase  staff  293092 Jan  5 14:14 local/bin/m4
bash-3.2$ ./local/bin/m4
Illegal instruction: 4
```

and then unsurprisingly one gets

```
