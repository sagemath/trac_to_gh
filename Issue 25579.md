This is a problem that has been plaguing me for a few months but I haven't taken much time to work out the source of the problem yet.

It might also be dependent on the package version of Cygwin's git pacakge, but when using the system git from Cygwin in a `./sage -sh` shell, it's broken.  A workaround is to put `PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH` in front.  So it seems maybe some library installed as part of Sage is incompatible with the system git.

This is a problem, in particular, for `pip install`ing packages from a git repo, for example.

I think I know the reason.  It's because DLL search order normally looks first in the same directory as the executable loading the DLL, then resorts to `$PATH`.  Since `git.exe` is in `/usr/bin/` it has most of its dependent DLLs right beside it.  But executables installed under `/usr/libexec/` do not, so they find these DLLs first in `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.

This is definitely a bit of an oddity to git, since so much of it is installed user `/usr/libexec/git-core`.  

I'm not sure much can be done about this from the Sage end of things.  Perhaps for the Sage-for-Windows build I can ensure that some DLLs are copied into `/usr/libexec/git-core/` in order for git to function properly.
