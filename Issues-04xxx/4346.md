sage: M=Matrix([1])

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

Attachment: **[sage-4346.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4346/sage-4346.patch.gz)**

The attached patch fixes the problem.  However, there are two additional issues, which should be addressed as new tickets.   

1. After applying this patch and doctesting all sage, there are a bunch of failures in the modular abelian varieties code:

```
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_ambient_jacobian.py # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_newform.py # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/morphism.py # 3 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py # 34 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 11 doctests failed
```

These are because of bugs in that code exposed by doing proper bounds checking.
This is now trac #4351, and must also be fixed before #4346 can go into Sage.  

2. In this patch, matrix_window does *not* do bounds checking by default.  This is because there is a bunch of internal usage of matrix_window for strassen algorithms, which actually relies on matrix_window not being bounds checked (it's ok as used by those algorithms).  However, a bunch of code would have to be changed to make bounds checking of matrix_window the default.  That said it is currently easy (even with this patch) to segfault sage interactively:

```
sage: a = matrix([1]).matrix_window(1,1,1,1)
sage: a

Matrix window of size 1 x 1 at (1,1):
[1]
sage: a[0,0] = 1


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

This is now trac #4350.
