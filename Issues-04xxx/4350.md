See trac #4346 first and apply that patch.  

2. In this patch, matrix_window does *not* do bounds checking by default.  This is because there is a bunch of internal usage of matrix_window for strassen algorithms, which actually relies on matrix_window not being bounds checked (it's ok as used by those algorithms).  However, a bunch of code would have to be changed to make bounds checking of matrix_window the default.  That said it is currently easy (even with this patch) to segfault sage interactively:

```
sage: a = matrix([1]).matrix_window(1,1,1,1)
sage: a

Matrix window of size 1 x 1 at (1,1):
[1]
sage: a[0,0] = 1


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
