# Issue 4190: [with patches, positive review] division of number field order elements doesn't check for membership

I think this just about says it all:

```
sage: OK = NumberField(x^2 - x + 2, 'w').ring_of_integers()
sage: w = OK.ring_generators()[0]
sage: 1/w in OK
True
```
I tested this for cubic fields as well, and the same problem comes up. I can't work out why this happens -- it must be something weird in the coercion framework, as there isn't a specific method for division or inversion of elements of orders: it falls back to NumberFieldElement.__invert__ and then somehow coerces the result back to an OrderElement without doing any checks along the way.

I discovered this when trying to find out whether one element of OK was divisible by another -- "x.divides(y)" raises an error, and "y/x in OK" always returns True, which isn't very helpful; the best I could find was "y in x*OK" which seems to give the right results.

I would assume Robert knows what this is all about, so I am adding him to the CC. 

In general it would be good to mention the issue on [sage-devel] so that the right people get a change to become aware of the problem since not too many people read [sage-trac].

OK, too bad.

You are right.  In fact one way to see where this is happening is to try OK(1/a) (where 1/a is not in OK) and see where the TypeError comes from, in this case order.py, in OK's `__call__` function.
