I think this just about says it all:

```
sage: OK = NumberField(x^2 - x + 2, 'w').ring_of_integers()
sage: w = OK.ring_generators()[0]
sage: 1/w in OK
True
```
I tested this for cubic fields as well, and the same problem comes up. I can't work out why this happens -- it must be something weird in the coercion framework, as there isn't a specific method for division or inversion of elements of orders: it falls back to NumberFieldElement.__invert__ and then somehow coerces the result back to an OrderElement without doing any checks along the way.

I discovered this when trying to find out whether one element of OK was divisible by another -- "x.divides(y)" raises an error, and "y/x in OK" always returns True, which isn't very helpful; the best I could find was "y in x*OK" which seems to give the right results.

Hi David,

I would assume Robert knows what this is all about, so I am adding him to the CC. 

In general it would be good to mention the issue on [sage-devel] so that the right people get a change to become aware of the problem since not too many people read [sage-trac].

Cheers,

Michael

Question: is it necessary to have three versions of this?   Would it not be enough to have one and the others would work just by inheritance?

Apart from that, I noticed that the doctest has a duplicate line (repeated 3 times!).

I tried to find out what code is run when you say "a in OK" but I have absolutely no idea.  I could not find any `__contains__` function which seemed to be relevant.  Does this work via some coercion magic, or by chance, or what have I missed?

The patch applies fine to 3.2.alpha3.  All tests in number_field/ pass.  You should add this doctest (from the original post):

```
sage: OK = NumberField(x^2 - x + 2, 'w').ring_of_integers()
sage: w = OK.ring_generators()[0]
sage: 1/w in OK
False
```

As for the inheritance thing: unfortunately, OrderElement_relative, OrderElement_absolute and OrderElement_quadratic all inherit from the corresponding number field classes, which all have different _ div _ implementations, and multiple inheritance is banned. So there is no one place we can put the method where it will be inherited by everything. Personally I'm not sure I agree on that design decision, but I don't have the skills or the time to reimplement it otherwise. 

As far as I can tell, the "a in OK" is calling some very generic code (probably in sage.structure.Parent at a guess) which checks whether or not a.parent() is OK, and if it isn't, attempts to coerce a into OK via OK's __ call __ method, returning False if this fails.

I am in India at the moment and it is late evening local time; I will get to work on improving the doctests tomorrow.

OK, too bad.

You are right.  In fact one way to see where this is happening is to try OK(1/a) (where 1/a is not in OK) and see where the TypeError comes from, in this case order.py, in OK's `__call__` function.

No hurry.  If you had time to look at #4392, even better!

I could only find the duplicate line in one of the doctests, but I've killed it there. I also realised that while my patch fixed the div methods it didn't fix the separate invert methods, so I've added a similar fix to those.

OK (!) so there was only one duplicate.  Good to have the `__invert__` functions too.  I successfully applied the second patch on top of the first one, and all tests in number_field pass.

As far as I can see this is ready to go in.
