jsmath was standard ever since we used it with the notebook.  That wasn't the point of the variable.  The point is that it gives users a way to turn of use of jsmath entirely, which may be a very good idea in some settings (e.g., low bandwidth notebook servers).   Basically, for no good reason I think you've removed functionality.  Make a new patch that just has the first change in the first version of the patch you attached above.

Okay, I updated the jsmath-spkg.patch to address the concerns above.

Note that functionality spoken of in the review has been broken for a while.  I think this is because run_notebook.py automatically sets the JSMATH variable to True, no matter what.  However, fixing this so that it works is a different issue than this ticket.

Looks good to me. Some review changes were made at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/jsmath-3.6a.p0.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p1.spkg

Please rereview, the changes are fairly minor. I mostly fixed stylistic issues as well as made sure that old jsmath installs (including their fonts) are cleaned out to avoid problems due to left over cruft. This means that an upgrade to jsmath deletes also the image fonts, but that seems a worthwhile price to pay.

For the record: jsmath-3.6a.p0.spkg is going into standard Sage while jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p1.spkg should go into the optional repo.

Cheers,

Michael
