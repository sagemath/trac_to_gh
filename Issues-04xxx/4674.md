<a id='comment:16'></a>Looks good to me. Some review changes were made at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/jsmath-3.6a.p0.spkg
* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p1.spkg

Please rereview, the changes are fairly minor. I mostly fixed stylistic issues as well as made sure that old jsmath installs (including their fonts) are cleaned out to avoid problems due to left over cruft. This means that an upgrade to jsmath deletes also the image fonts, but that seems a worthwhile price to pay.

For the record: jsmath-3.6a.p0.spkg is going into standard Sage while jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p1.spkg should go into the optional repo.
