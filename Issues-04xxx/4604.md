From sage-support (and this has bugged me too):


I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something I'm misunderstanding,
but for 2D graphics I can write code like this.

```
g = Graphics()
g += line( [ [-1,-1], [1,1] ] )
g.show()
```
But in 3D if I do either

```
g = Graphics()
g += sphere( (1,1,1), 2 )
g.show()
```
or

```
g = sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3dGroup()
g += sphere( (1,1,1), 2 )
g.show()
```
I get the error: 

```
ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence
```

Is there something I'm missing on how to create a graphics object and
add 3D graphics to it like the way it's done in 2D?
