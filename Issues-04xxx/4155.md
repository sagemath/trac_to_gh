The attached patch provides a significant speedup of John Voight's totally real field enumeration code. The patch moves `enumerate_totallyreal_fields_prim` into Cython (and thus `totallyreal.py` becomes `totallyreal.pyx`). Most of the speedup comes from explicitly declaring and being careful about types. A few small improvements to the Pari interface are thrown in, since they were written in the process of speeding up this code.

While I haven't performed any sort of systematic test, it seems that this code offers a factor of at least 2X speedup for enumerating fields of degree 5 or 6.

Not sure what was going on with my version of sage--something must have happened during an upgrade.  A fresh install shows (as with Michael) that the patch applies cleanly.  

I did several tests of my own, including a long one (9h 50m to compute the 70463 totally real quintic fields with discriminant <= 50000000), and it passed all of these tests.  So it gets the green flag from me.

Awesome work, Craig!

Oops: While valgrinding totallyreal.py I saw this:

```
==16950== More than 10000000 total errors detected.  I'm not reporting any more.
==16950== Final error counts will be inaccurate.  Go fix your program!
==16950== Rerun with --error-limit=no to disable this cutoff.  Note
==16950== that errors may occur in your program without prior warning from
==16950== Valgrind, because errors are no longer being displayed.
```
Those are the issues:

There are more, but you get the idea. I will poke around.

It seems that there are no memory leaks in the code as far as I know, but one valgrind tests is still running.

Cheers,

Michael
