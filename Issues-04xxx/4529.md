**OLD DISCUSSION BELOW :)**

Currently plot() has no option to use logarithmic scales.

One workaround is to use matplotlib directly, with its semilogy(), semilogx() and loglog() functions, but that wouldn't produce plots with the customisations implemented in sage.
Another workaround is messing with the plot figure like:

```python
import pylab
p=plot(x,marker='.')
f=pylab.figure()
f.gca().set_xscale('log')
p.save(figure=f)
```

But that creates two problems:

* The first problem is that the adaptive choosing of points just considers linear scale, so the points get too much spaced apart in the beginning of the plot and too close in the end.
* The second problem relates to the axis, which, for the same reason, isn't located right.

Also, this requires the user to know how to deal with figures, which is not directly exposed by sage.

There are some possibilities to fix that:
1. Make plot() detect if the figure changes the scales and modify the adaptive algorithm and the axis codes accordingly
2. Create a kwarg to tell plot() to implement the scale-change internally
3. Create other functions to use loglog(), semilogx() and semilogy()
4. Many (or all) of the above together, since they aren't mutually exclusive

From what I noticed, Mathematica implements the separate functions way, but it may be better to fix the issue in plot() itself and if the other functions are wanted, just make it so that they call plot() with the correct arguments

It seems something was wrong with the plot in the above example, or 
something.  Anyways, starting with: 
p=plot(x,(x,1,10)) 
works fine. 
To do #4529, I'd suggest adding a keyword to show that defines the 
scales of the x and y axes.  I've added some comments to the ticket.

I added a patch to `Graphics` class which introduces log plots. Some salient points
1. I had to "disable" some tick formatting for log plots because matplotlib wasn't behaving well with the formatting that is done in `Graphics().maptplotlib()` (ex. the error in[comment:11](#comment%3A11), out of memory error, etc)
2. The patch in this ticket relies on the patches in #12974 which is mostly a cleanup of the `Graphics` class.
3. In trying to implement my own class, I started to look at each of the matplotlib functions more carefully, and found out the reason(s) why setting the scale wasn't working (see point 1.). The result is that I could implement log scale right inside `Graphics` by carefully weeding out the corner cases. I hope I got all the corner cases.

Todo:
1. A patch to `plot()` and other functions will take more time to implement. :(
2. Probably need to make sure that user does not specify tick formatters and locators which don't behave well with log plots.
3. Feedback is welcome! I need to know if I missed something.

Example code:

```
p = plot(exp, 1, 10)
p.set_scale('loglog')
p.show()
xd=range(-5,5); yd=[10**_ for _ in xd]; p=list_plot(zip(xd, yd),plotjoined=True)
p.set_yscale('log', 2) # Set only y-axis to log and with base of log being 2.
p.show()
```

I hope to be able to go over this very valuable idea at the current Bug Days.  Trivial comment while I'm doing a cursory read-through 

```
- ``linear`` -- both the axes are linear. 
```
should probably indicate 

```
- ``'linear'`` -- both the axes are linear. 
```
or 

```
- 'linear' -- both the axes are linear. 
```
and similarly in all other cases, especially when looking at inputs (since it's very important that these are strings, not just commands.

* I feel like it would be good to have a little discussion about whether the scale should be "hardcoded" into a Graphics object; somehow this feels not right to me, though I'd hate to ignore the work here for that reason.  It just seems better to be able to add plots, then "show" them however we want.  Naturally, since a lot of that is set as keywords passed from plot to show, there could be conflicts, but that could be up to the user.
   Especially since the bulk of the "work" done in the code still happens in `show` and friends, I don't see why we couldn't just cherry-pick the keyword `scale` and handle it like we do things like plot tick formatting, separately from `Graphics`.  The interface is cleaner that way.

* Separately, in either case, should we globally import all of these many new functions?  For instance, having the `listplot` variants and `semilogx_list_plot, semilogy_list_plot` both available (as opposed to `semilog_plot(keywords=x or y)`) seems overkill.

How would this introduce an inconsistency?  Is the suggestion on the table that the log option would only be for one of them?   I don't see why we can't have our cake and eat it too.
* Log options in `show` or `save`
* `loglog_plot(f,(x,a,b))` is an alias for `plot(f,(x,a,b),scale=foo)`

> 1. Don't have any of the `loglog_*, semilog*` and handle scaling only through the `scale` and `base` parameters of `plot` and `list_plot` (and actually all other plots)


If Mma and friends have it, this is probably not a good idea.

Yes, that's a very good idea!

Thanks kcrisman. That poll is comprehensive enough.

Updated the [attachment:trac_4529-add_logscale_to_Graphics.2.patch Graphics patch]. This now has modifications only to matplotlib and sister functions, and leaves the `Graphics` class's attributes alone.

There was a problem with the ticker in that the labels were in scientific notation (ex. `1e10`) and not in the `base^exponent` form (ex. `10^10`). This is now fixed, except for the case when the user enters a custom tick formatter. This last case is up to the user to handle.

The interface to `plot` and `list_plot` remains unchanged. However, I will wait for the poll in sage-devel before deciding what extra plot commands to introduce.

Some comments:
* Shouldn't `base=2` raise an error when `scale='linear'` in your example? Maybe the 

```
       if scale is None: 
            return ('linear', 'linear', 10, 10) 
```
   could return 'linear', 'linear', None, None?
* In `_matplotlib_tick_formatter`, should `base` and `scale` be next to each other in the function definition?  (This is a very minor critique, of course.)
* Nice consolidation of the `ticklabels` business at the end of the patch.
* Regardless of the outcome of the poll (on which you can vote), I think one should add a lot more examples in the documentation for `show` for the various options.  Lots of them.

```
sage: G = plot(exp(x), (x,5,10))

I had thought about it. My decision was to silently ignore this error because it is not fatal in any way and we handle it properly (i.e. we ignore it and do the right thing).

**Edit:** This seems to be the same behavior as in matplotlib.

>  * In `_matplotlib_tick_formatter`, should `base` and `scale` be next to each other in the function definition?  (This is a very minor critique, of course.)


Well, except for `subplot`, the rest of the arguments are alphabetically arranged. :) Personally, I find it quite hard to find out where a particular function or argument is present in a typical Sage code. There is no particular manner in which the functions are arranged. Especially in several thousand line files like graphics.py it becomes hard to scroll around and edit code.

>  * Regardless of the outcome of the poll (on which you can vote), I think one should add a lot more examples in the documentation for `show` for the various options.  Lots of them.


I will add some more.

>  * What's going on with the `pr, i  = *, 0` thing removed?  I just don't know what it had been doing - seems to have been dead code, but I always get nervous when I have no idea what it *used'' to do...


Yes. I have no idea what it was for. It is dead code, so I removed it.

>  * kini says that the `[13:]` seems brittle if matplotlib's API changes; would it be possible to remove the specific string `\\mathdefault` instead?


To remove it from matplotlib, we need to set `rcParams['text.usetex']=True`. But this makes matplotlib try to compile latex on its own and use dvipng to convert from dvi to png, etc. Moreover, this parameter seems to be persistent and remains throughout the current session. So, simply editing the string seemed a more viable option to me.

If the API changes (which seems unlikely to me), then the fix will be very easy too.

>  * I wonder about the not setting of the spines outward when the axes shouldn't cross.  Here is an example which serves the point:

I will have to see how to handle this. Messing around with the spines was one of the primary reasons why setting scale wasn't working - the "converting masked to int" error.

>  * It's fairly easy to have just one tick in a given direction, which usually raises an error in normal plots but isn't raising an error for yours.  I'm not sure if one would want to raise an error like "Use a different base so that you get at least two ticks!" or something.


I think it is up to the user to either change their range, or their base, or provide custom ticks.

> But even with all of these comments, and waiting for the post-poll patch, **fantastic** job on this.  Someone had to come along to finally wrap this for us, it's been requested zillions of times, and this is very worth the effort, thank you so much.

I think kini explained this sufficiently in[comment:41](#comment%3A41).  I don't care which way it's done.

The following are the changes in the latest patches:
1. labeling of minor ticks was flaky; it is fixed now.
2. added several examples to `show()`
3. fixed a problem in axes position of the matplotlib() function when custom xmax, xmin, etc were passed. Try this plot (without these patches) and then try with these patches :)

```
plot(x).show(xmin=1, xmax=-1)
```
4. there is an [attachment:trac_4529-check_for_single_tick.patch optional patch] where we check for a single tick. this is tricky and I don't know a good and complete solution. Moreover, it makes most of the functions like 'arc, disk, etc' stop "just working" with log scale. It will be good if you have a better idea how to check for ticks which don't affect these functions too. We can't use xmin, xmax, etc to determine ticks because some of them might well be negative and matplotlib will neglect these values.

No problems. It is better to have a good implementation than to hurry through a bad one.

Actually, there is zero change to be done to the code in `plot` or `list_plot`, except to add some examples. The only change that the additional  patch will do is make very thin (one-liners) wrappers which defines the `plot_*` and `list_plot_*` wrappers and pass the correct scale option to `plot` and `list_plot`. The current consensus from the poll seems to favor this syntax. In view of this, the patch [attachment:trac_4529-add_docs_eg_to_some_user_facing_functions.patch] requires only a renaming of the functions, and some extra examples.

We can add exactly similar examples to `plot()` and `list_plot()`. Currently, since the function is `Graphics.show()`, I decided to write it as `show(scale=...)` instead of `plot(scale=...)` since the former is more pertinent.

Yes I am aware that the examples I provided work. But most of the examples in the docs of those functions (arc, disk, contour_plot, etc) *do not* work out of the box, and we get the "too few ticks" error.

Yes. That's why I said that the tick checking function is not robust and I also don't know how to make it robust.

The minor ticks are generated by passing in multiples of 1/base to the subs parameter of LogLocator. So, for base 10, you will have ticks at say, `0.1*10^-1, 0.2*10^-1, ..., 0.9*10^-1, 10^-1`.

But they 'work', just not with the log scale, right?

I've been looking at it for over an hour and, at least for plots with only positive data, I think I have something.  For ones with negative data it would be much more ugly and maybe not worth it.

By the way, I get

```
sage: sage: disk((0,0), 1, (0, 3*pi/2)).show(scale='semilogx',base=2)
/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/axes.py:1114: UserWarning: aspect is not supported for Axes with xscale=log, yscale=linear
  % (xscale, yscale))
```
when I try something that has an aspect ratio defined (disk, etc.)

> The minor ticks are generated by passing in multiples of 1/base to the subs parameter of LogLocator. So, for base 10, you will have ticks at say, `0.1*10^-1, 0.2*10^-1, ..., 0.9*10^-1, 10^-1`.

So, you will always see only one major tick and no minor ticks.

I understood that, but didn't think through the implications for `base=2`.   By the way, maybe changing

```
srange(base_inv, 1+base_inv, base_inv)
```
to 

```
srange(2*base_inv, 1, base_inv)
```
would be useful, so that minor and major ticks don't overlap... probably doesn't matter, but could be ok.

ValueError: Either expand the range of the independent variable to allow two different integer powers of your `base`, or change your `base` to a smaller number.
sage: P.show(xmax=10)
```

Some more food for thought.
* Your LaTeX hack doesn't work in all cases, apparently.

```
sage: P = plot(x^2,(x,1,8),scale='loglog', base=1.5); P
```
  This is because matplotlib has

```
        else:
            if usetex:
                s = r'$%s%d^{%d}$'% (sign_string, b, nearest_long(fx))
            else:
                s = r'$\mathdefault{%s%d^{%d}}$'% (sign_string, b,
                                                   nearest_long(fx))
```
  which uses decimal formatting, but of course that only makes sense for integer bases.   I feel like this is a bug in mpl; what do you think?  Anyway, I am hesitant to patch our matplotlib just for this use case, though it should be a new ticket, I think.  The same thing happens with `base=3/2`, unsurprisingly.
* This also bites your example with `base=float(e)` - did you look at the picture?  Plain old `base=e` should be possible, but hacking around the fact that matplotlib won't accept this maybe makes it not worth it, and in any case I don't know that "real-life" people often use that for semilog plots.  Just pointing it out.
* Here is a fun horrible example that you probably were thinking of with adding plots - maybe we should find a check for this.

```
sage: G =  plot_vector_field((e^x,e^(x+y)),(x,0.1,10),(y,0.1,10),scale=('loglog', 2))
sage: H = plot(x^2,(x,0,10),scale='linear')
sage: G+H
```
  At least originally you thought this should raise an error.

Almost done with my changes!  Here are things that definitely have to be decided or fixed.
* What to do with noninteger bases.  Tell people not to use them?  Throw an exception?  Hack mpl?  Give copious examples of them looking bad?
* Decide what to do with adding plots.

Other points.
* I can't get `list_plot` to work with `scale='loglog'` or `'semilogx'` when passing it a list.  From your examples -

```
        sage: yl = [2**k for k in range(10)]  
        sage: list_plot(yl, scale='semilogy')       # fine
        sage: list_plot(yl, scale='loglog')         # horiz. axis weird, no points
        sage: list_plot_loglog(yl, base=2) # same weird
```
  I assume this is because there is automatically a change to the list of tuples zipped with `range(n)`, so that there is always a zero involved in the horizontal axis.   Here is the real problem.

```
point([(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5)],scale='semilogx',base=2) # doesn't work
```
  What do you think the "correct" behavior is here?

I fixed a bunch of minor doc issues.  I also added a lot of

Thanks for the latest work!

In your latest patch, I see things like

```
The `"semilogx"` scale
```
But this will typeset as a LaTeX style thing, which is wrong.  Try

```
The ``"semilogx"`` scale
```
and then all should be well with those.  Easy enough to update on the last patch.

> Forgot about noninteger bases: I think we should discourage the users from using them.

Hmm, ok.  In that case maybe you can update your latest patch to still do the "e" example but make it really clear that this is (currently) not intended input?  I don't want to actually check for integers, though; presumably in some contexts one could want 1.5.   Do you think I should report this upstream to mpl?

True.  And I noticed the parametric business later on, good catch.  I think this might be worth doing.  Again, I'm not really worried - we had some fun laughing at the plots one gets from loglog plots of arcs and circles here.  But anyway.

Oh, that explains what I saw.  I have to say it was very weird.

I await the latest version of the last (?) patch.

Good thing!

I've opened [https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/909](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/909) for the mpl issue.  Hopefully we'll hear something eventually.

Very minor request - on an update of your patch, perhaps.

```
Note: 

- Although it is possible to provide a noninteger ``base``, the 
```
maybe that could be in a standard 

```
.. note

   Although it is possible ...
```
which would render nicely in the built documentation.

The

```
.. warning:: 
```
should have a blank line after it.

Here's the complete list from `sage -docbuild reference html`.

```
/Users/.../sage-5.1.beta0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/plot/graphics.py:docstring of sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.axes_color:3: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

Unfortunately it's too late now for me to properly test everything again - time for bed - but I am not really too concerned, given the stuff I've been trying all along.  If you are able to deal with these formatting issues, I'd be grateful, and even if I have to deal with it slowly we should certainly be ready for positive review by the end of the week.  Hopefully by tomorrow!

Luckily I only had to rebase one of these, due to some fuzz which the release manager doesn't always like.  Otherwise this is good to go!  Note the long list of dependencies, only so that all patches apply properly on 5.1.beta1.

Plots seem fine still.

With respect to one minor issue - this is nothing to do with positive review, but a question for ppurka.  

Compare

```
plot(x,(x,-1,1),xmin=1,xmax=-1)
plot(x,(x,-1,1)).show(xmin=1,xmax=-1)
```
with the patches (or even just first patch).  I would think they should be the same (i.e., like the second one, as commented in the first patch).

ppurka:

Did we ever open a ticket for fixing this?  Anyway, [it's been resolved](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/909#issuecomment-7756212) in [this mpl pull request](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/960), apparently.  I *think* that we put in a comment about how this doesn't (yet) work, so there would be something to do now that this has been done.
