The doctest module in 3.2.2.alpha0 seems to report *all* failed doctests as "A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest." This occurs even when the failure is a very simple one:

```
def bad_docstring():
        r""" A function with a bogus docstring.

        EXAMPLES:
                sage: 2
                1
        """
        pass
```

Running "sage -t" on a file containing only the above code returns a "mysterious error", both on 32-bit SuSE (upgraded from 3.2.1) and on the sage.math binary.

The issue has been more than likely introduced by #717. My guess is that the output from the doctest run is not passed back and the logic "no output -> mysterious error" kicks in. 

Cheers,
