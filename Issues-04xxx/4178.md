On my PPC Power Book 550 MHz, 768 MB RAM, Mac OS X 10.4.11, Xcode 2.5, the "long" doctest fails because the timeout is too small.

As soon as I have checked how big it should be (on that box) to make it run through, I'll add the info here.

Nope, this is a won't fix. The long timeout is *huge*, i.e. 30 minutes. The problem is another one, i.e. ecm not returning and hence the doctest never finishes. This issue is already covered by another DSage ticket.

Cheers,

Michael
