**Attachment:** [trac_4066_solaris_fixes.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4066/trac_4066_solaris_fixes.patch.gz)

Ok, I have attached an updated patch that 

* passes -ba
* builds fine on Solaris, OSX and Linux and passes doctests on OSX and Linux

Note that _[A-Z] are numerical constants on BSD and Solaris and should not be used as variable names.

I am CCing Robert since he was involved in writing that code (I think :))

Cheers,

Michael

It applies cleanly against my alpha3, it builds on my 64-bit Linux box, `sage -t rings` passes which should use this functionality (?)

It SEGFAULTS with `sage -tp 2 sage/rings` in bernouli_mod_p.pyx though. If that can't be reproduced it might just be a weird combination of patches on my machine.
