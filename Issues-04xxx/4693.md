After looking at #4690, I realized that a lot could be done to "update" piecewise.py.  This includes not explicitly using Maxima where we don't need to in order to take advantage of pynac in the future.

**Resolution:** fixed

This applies without any problem to Sage 3.2.1 and my current 3.2.2.alpha0 merge tree. I am also quite certain that this patch applies against 3.2 since piecewise.py hasn't been touched in a while.

Cheers,

Michael

One more thing: I know we added doctests, but the slow down seems larger than it should be:

3.2.1:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py"      
	 [87.8 s]
``` 
vs. 3.2.2.alpha0

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py"      
	 [145.3 s]
```
It might be the cleanup for plotting, but I have not investigated.

Cheers,

Michael
