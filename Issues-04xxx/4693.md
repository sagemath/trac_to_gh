After looking at #4690, I realized that a lot could be done to "update" piecewise.py.  This includes not explicitly using Maxima where we don't need to in order to take advantage of pynac in the future.

This applies without any problem to Sage 3.2.1 and my current 3.2.2.alpha0 merge tree. I am also quite certain that this patch applies against 3.2 since piecewise.py hasn't been touched in a while.

One more thing: I know we added doctests, but the slow down seems larger than it should be:

3.2.1:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py"      
	 [87.8 s]
``` 
vs. 3.2.2.alpha0

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/functions/piecewise.py"      
	 [145.3 s]
```
It might be the cleanup for plotting, but I have not investigated.

Cheers,

Michael
