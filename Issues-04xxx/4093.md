3.1.2.rc1 has this doctest failure:

```
File "/home/john/sage-3.1.2.rc1/tmp/period_lattice.py", line 281:
    sage: EllipticCurve('389a1').period_lattice().sigma(CC(2,1))
Expected:
    2.609121635701083769 - 0.20086508082458695134*I
Got:
    2.609121635701083769 - 0.20086508082458695200*I
```

The patch fixes this by replacin the last 3 digits above by "...".


Keywords: **elliptic curve period lattice**

Component: **number theory**
