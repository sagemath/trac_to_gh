Do

```
sage: W=Words('ab')
sage: W.alphabet?
```

and you get the following help example :

```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.words import Words_over_Alphabet
sage: W = Words_over_Alphabet([1,2,3])
sage: W.alphabet()
[1, 2, 3]
sage: from sage.combinat.words.words import OrderedAlphabet
sage: W = Words_over_Alphabet(OrderedAlphabet('ab'))
sage: W.alphabet()
Ordered Alphabet ['a', 'b']
```

The first of the above example is misleading. In fact, it is not usable :

```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.words import Words_over_Alphabet
sage: W = Words_over_Alphabet([1,2,3])
sage: W.alphabet()
[1, 2, 3]
sage: W([1,1,1,2,1,3])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'rank'
```

The problem comes from the fact that Words_over_Alphabet doesn't check the input alphabet before asigning it to self._alphabet(). It should either do `alphabet=OrderedAlphabet(alphabet)` before or check the type of the input alphabet with a isinstance.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
This problem was solved by #6519 :

```
sage: from sage.combinat.words.words import Words_over_Alphabet
sage: W = Words_over_Alphabet([1,2,3])
sage: W.alphabet()
[1, 2, 3]
sage: W([1,1,1,2,1,3])
word: 111213
```

```
sage: Y = Words_over_Alphabet('abcde')
sage: Y.alphabet()
'abcde'
sage: Y('abababacde')
word: abababacde
```

So, I propose that this ticket be closed.
