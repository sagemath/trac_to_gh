I can't get #4580 to compile, and I think this is why:

#4580 adds "`from python_int cimport PyInt_AS_LONG`" to a Sage library file.  I believe this is intended to refer to $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Cython/Includes/python_int.pxd, but the setup.py dependency checker doesn't know about these Cython built-in pxd files, so it fails with an error: 

```
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'sage/rings/polynomial/python_int.pxd'
```
