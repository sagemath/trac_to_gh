I think that the following example speaks for itself. (This was on an x86, 32 bit, running Ubuntu.)

Also, I believe that these examples had no problems in sage 3.0.2.

Burcin about his code, not the problem reported here:

```
[6:36pm] burcin: hmm.. I think I found the problem..
[6:36pm] burcin: still vague though
[6:36pm] mabshoff: burcin: I CCed RobertWB on that existing leak ticket with the exponentiation and hopefully he will just post a one line patch.
[6:36pm] mabshoff: Ok 
[6:36pm] burcin: I was being a good coercion user and called .coerce()
[6:36pm] burcin: if I just use the __call__ on the parent, things work much much faster
[6:36pm] mabshoff: And it doesn't leak?
[6:37pm] burcin: I am guessing that the leak also goes away.. because this example ate more than 2gb memory with the leak
[6:37pm] mabshoff: yeah

An interesting test point: 

```
class TestParent(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        self._populate_coercion_lists_()
    def _has_coerce_map_from_(self, X):
        return True
    def _element_constructor_(self, x):
        raise TypeError
```

Now this leaks

```
%python

from sage.all import get_memory_usage

def test(R, S):
    mor = S.convert_map_from(R)
    print get_memory_usage()
    for i in range(10000):
        try:
            mor = S.convert_map_from(R)
            a = mor._call_(R.gen())
        except:
            pass
    print get_memory_usage()
```

But this doesn't 

```
%cython

from sage.all import get_memory_usage

def test(R, S):
    mor = S.convert_map_from(R)
    print get_memory_usage()
    for i in range(10000):
        try:
            mor = S.convert_map_from(R)
            a = mor._call_(R.gen())
        except:
            pass
    print get_memory_usage()

This is a Cython error, not a coercion error. When something is returned from within a try block, it appears the (cached) exception is not released. 

```
%cython

```

Now `test()` will leak.

The new Cython.spkg reduces the leak significantly:
Without:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
417.98828125
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
....:     a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
509.26171875
```
With:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
416.19140625
sage: 
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
....:     a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
437.97265625
```
But unfortunately it doesn't fix it completely:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
416.19140625
sage: 
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
....:     a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
437.97265625
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
    a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
459.99609375
```
Consequently I will split the Cython.spkg from this ticket.

Cheers,

Michael

Another data point.

I took the example from #4683 (Michael, it was argued that #4683 is a duplicate).

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
704.5390625
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
803.67578125
...
sage: get_memory_usage()
1093.203125
sage: del v
sage: get_memory_usage()
1093.203125
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
1183.86328125
sage: del v
sage: get_memory_usage()
1183.86328125
sage: v=1
sage: get_memory_usage()
1183.86328125
...
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
1279.55078125
sage: w = deepcopy(v)
sage: get_memory_usage()
1295.18359375
sage: del w
sage: get_memory_usage()
1295.18359375
```

Therefore it seems to me that the problem is not exponentiation but a failure in deallocation.

This does indeed fix the issue for me:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: get_memory_usage()
416.21484375
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
....:     a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
416.21484375
sage: for z in xrange(10000):
    a = 3.0^CC.0
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
416.21484375
```
Doctesting now ...
