<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
The code looks good, but doesn't handle negatives correctly:

```
sage: (-1/25).is_perfect_power()
True
```

Fix is pretty obvious (call `mpz_sgn` on the numerator, make sure we don't get -1), so I'm adding a patch that fixes it.

Actually, I retract my review above. This patch is completely wrong! In particular, look at this:

```
sage: (4/27).is_perfect_power()
True
```

That's absolutely not a perfect power! This code is too naive. If both the numerator and denominator are perfect powers, we need to see what powers they are, and make sure that one of the powers divides the other. Here's a battery of tests that needs to pass:

```
 sage: (2/27).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (4/27).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (-1/25).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (-1/27).is_perfect_power()
 True
```

One might want even more doctests ...

It won't be trivial to fix since the gmp function only returns whether or not the argument is a perfect power, not what the root or exponents are.

I suggest that we implement something involving the factorizations.  Assuming that both numerator and denonimator are perfect powers, compute (where the input is r = +-n/d)

```
gcd(gcd([e for p,e in n.factor()]), gcd([e for p,e in d.factor()]))
```
If that is 1 return 1.  If it is e>1 then return e if r is positive or if e is odd and r is negative, otherwise (e even, r<0) return e.prime_to_m_part(2), i.e. the odd part of e.  This will return the largest e such that r is an e'th power.

I don't see what else we can do unless gmp has a better function.

That would be good.  All we have to do is ask!

Something is wrong:

```
sage: a=(-1/20)^3
sage: a.is_perfect_power()
False
```
but then so is this:

```
sage: a=(-20)^3
sage: a.is_perfect_power()
False
```
which does not call the new function but the old one (with integers).  Is this a bug in gmp?  If so it should be reported.

Replying to [@robertwb](#comment%3A10):
> Integer.is_perfect_power is a direct call to mpz_perfect_power_p. Looks like a bug in gmp to me. That's really bad. 


```
sage: len([a for a in srange(100) if not (-a^3).is_perfect_power()])
24
```
Experiment shows that it gives the wrong answer for `-a^3` whenever a is not square-free.

The upcoming eMPIRe will fix the issue that we are currently seeing in gmp:

```
sage: len([a for a in srange(10**6) if not (-a^3).is_perfect_power()]) 
0 
```
This is mpir-svn1523 and we are planning to switch in Sage 3.4, so this will happen around SD12.

```

sage: time len([a for a in srange(10**6) if not (-a^3).is_perfect_power()])

I have made this #4935 since it is seemingly unrelated to the correctness issue.

We are switching to eMPIRe in 3.3.alpha0, so I am not sure how much of the workaround in this patch ought to be removed. It might be a good idea to rebase this patch for 3.3.alpha0 and hold on for now.

This is going in as is for now even though eMPIRe will be in 3.3.alpha0. I will open a followup ticket to deal with using the eMPIRe function directly again, but since this adds doctests it will be merged.
