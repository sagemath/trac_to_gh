The code looks good, but doesn't handle negatives correctly:

```
sage: (-1/25).is_perfect_power()
True
```

Fix is pretty obvious (call `mpz_sgn` on the numerator, make sure we don't get -1), so I'm adding a patch that fixes it.

Actually, I retract my review above. This patch is completely wrong! In particular, look at this:

```
sage: (4/27).is_perfect_power()
True
```

That's absolutely not a perfect power! This code is too naive. If both the numerator and denominator are perfect powers, we need to see what powers they are, and make sure that one of the powers divides the other. Here's a battery of tests that needs to pass:

```
 sage: (2/27).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (4/27).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (-1/25).is_perfect_power()
 False
 sage: (-1/27).is_perfect_power()
 True
```

One might want even more doctests ...

It won't be trivial to fix since the gmp function only returns whether or not the argument is a perfect power, not what the root or exponents are.

I suggest that we implement something involving the factorizations.  Assuming that both numerator and denonimator are perfect powers, compute (where the input is r = +-n/d)

```
gcd(gcd([e for p,e in n.factor()]), gcd([e for p,e in d.factor()]))
```
If that is 1 return 1.  If it is e>1 then return e if r is positive or if e is odd and r is negative, otherwise (e even, r<0) return e.prime_to_m_part(2), i.e. the odd part of e.  This will return the largest e such that r is an e'th power.

I don't see what else we can do unless gmp has a better function.

ok -- I had not thought of checking the p-valuation for small primes but that's a good idea.  Otherwise it's the textbook method, which would not be hard to adapt to provide the exponent.

That would be good.  All we have to do is ask!

Certainly it's clear that you can replace n/d by n*d, but we already know what to do if know the numerator is an e'th power and the denom is an f'th power (answer = gcd(e,f), or the odd part of that if the number was negative), which would be more efficient.  So as long as we can solve the problem (with the exponent) for integers then it will be easy to do it for rationals.

The upcoming eMPIRe will fix the issue that we are currently seeing in gmp:

```

This is mpir-svn1523 and we are planning to switch in Sage 3.4, so this will happen around SD12.

Alright, I've coded up a new version of the above patch that we should use until we merge either a new GMP or eMPIRe with the fix included. This patch works around the GMP bug for both integers and rationals.

Assuming that this gets a positive review, I'll open another ticket to say "remove ugly workaround" once we merge a new arithmetic package with a fix.

We are switching to eMPIRe in 3.3.alpha0, so I am not sure how much of the workaround in this patch ought to be removed. It might be a good idea to rebase this patch for 3.3.alpha0 and hold on for now.

Cheers,

This is going in as is for now even though eMPIRe will be in 3.3.alpha0. I will open a followup ticket to deal with using the eMPIRe function directly again, but since this adds doctests it will be merged.
