Some questions/remarks.
Shouldn't the following always be true ? (at least this is what I understand from the docstring)

```python
normalize_slice( s , size_list) == range(size_list)[s.start:s.stop:s.step]
```

If no (which is the case actually) this looks quite incoherent to me;
if yes, is there a reason not to rewrite this fonction as a one liner?

Jason Grout just brought up an example in IRC where exactly that would happen. Here's a case:

```
sage: range(3)[2::-1]
[2, 1, 0]
```

`normalize_slice` will **not** return that, since it interprets a missing `stop` to be equal to `size`. This isn't documented as part of the Python semantics, but I think we should switch it to behave the same way regardless. (Also, it'll be easy to implement.)

This is now `needs work` until I change this.

apply normalize_size.patch on top of previous patch.  This corrects all errors pointed out above and I believe is faster and simpler as well.

A lot better, but there are still bugs.

I would recommand to try something like this to test extensively:

```python
def safe_norm(i,j,k,l):
    try:
        return sage.misc.misc_c.normalize_slice(slice(i,j,k),l)
    except ValueError:
        return "error"

def safe_range(i,j,k,l):
    try:
        return range(l)[i:j:k]
    except ValueError:
        return "error"

d=[-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,None]
ld=len(d)-1
for r in xrange(500):
    i=d[randint(0,ld)]
    j=d[randint(0,ld)]
    k=d[randint(0,ld)]
    l=randint(-8,8)
    r1=safe_norm(i,j,k,l)
    r2=safe_range(i,j,k,l)
    if not r1==r2:
        print i,j,k,l,r1,r2
```

Okay, I think this makes all of this work redundant.  Equivalent functionality (and mostly equivalent or faster times) are found in the implementation:

```
range(*s.indices(size))
```

where s is the slice, size is the size of list.

And fourth, it does more error checking than we were doing (dealing with unnecessarily large size, etc) ...

I think we should do this. One question: should we keep all our doctests? It's like documentation for how you can use slices, which doesn't seem to appear elsewhere. :)

What Jason says above is exactly right -- there's no point trying to outdo Python, because it already is quite fast, and does all this for us. Plus, we can't miss corner cases this way. 

Ultimately, things could get faster with nice Cython support for slices. This isn't wildly pressing, but it should be easy to implement.

Apply only the newest `trac-4974.patch`. This patch simply removes `normalize_slice`.

We should make a note about using this for slices somewhere -- apparently, `range(*s.indices(size))` is a standard Python idiom (it's in **Python in a Nutshell**), so we should use it more.

+1 to the code cruft removal and adoption of standard python constructs.  I'm opening another ticket to add information about slices to the developer guide.

This patch applies and doctests pass in the file.
