Some questions/remarks.
Shouldn't the following always be true ? (at least this is what I understand from the docstring)

```python
normalize_slice( s , size_list) == range(size_list)[s.start:s.stop:s.step]
```

If no (which is the case actually) this looks quite incoherent to me;
if yes, is there a reason not to rewrite this fonction as a one liner?

Jason Grout just brought up an example in IRC where exactly that would happen. Here's a case:

```
sage: range(3)[2::-1]
[2, 1, 0]
```

`normalize_slice` will **not** return that, since it interprets a missing `stop` to be equal to `size`. This isn't documented as part of the Python semantics, but I think we should switch it to behave the same way regardless. (Also, it'll be easy to implement.)

This is now `needs work` until I change this.

A lot better, but there are still bugs.

I would recommand to try something like this to test extensively:

```python
def safe_norm(i,j,k,l):
    try:
        return sage.misc.misc_c.normalize_slice(slice(i,j,k),l)
    except ValueError:
        return "error"

def safe_range(i,j,k,l):
    try:
        return range(l)[i:j:k]
    except ValueError:
        return "error"

d=[-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,None]
ld=len(d)-1
for r in xrange(500):
    i=d[randint(0,ld)]
    j=d[randint(0,ld)]
    k=d[randint(0,ld)]
    l=randint(-8,8)
    r1=safe_norm(i,j,k,l)
    r2=safe_range(i,j,k,l)
    if not r1==r2:
        print i,j,k,l,r1,r2
```

I have no clean install of sage to do the real patch, but I hope it helps...

ylchapuy: nice.  I like how you avoided the redundant comparisons in my code.  

In scanning through your code, it has a few places where the stuff following the +=size lines should be taken out of the body of the if statement and placed after the if statement instead.

Okay, I think this makes all of this work redundant.  Equivalent functionality (and mostly equivalent or faster times) are found in the implementation:

```
range(*s.indices(size))
```

where s is the slice, size is the size of list.

What Jason says above is exactly right -- there's no point trying to outdo Python, because it already is quite fast, and does all this for us. Plus, we can't miss corner cases this way. 

Ultimately, things could get faster with nice Cython support for slices. This isn't wildly pressing, but it should be easy to implement.

Apply only the newest `trac-4974.patch`. This patch simply removes `normalize_slice`.

We should make a note about using this for slices somewhere -- apparently, `range(*s.indices(size))` is a standard Python idiom (it's in **Python in a Nutshell**), so we should use it more.

+1 to the code cruft removal and adoption of standard python constructs.  I'm opening another ticket to add information about slices to the developer guide.

This patch applies and doctests pass in the file.
