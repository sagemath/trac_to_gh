Example:

```
sage: ks3 = kSchurFunctions(QQ,3)
sage: s = SFASchur(ks3.base_ring())
sage: s(ks3(s([1,1,1,1])))
s[1, 1, 1, 1] + t^3*s[4]
```

In general, s(ks3(foo)) returns the_right_thing + bad_stuff  where bad_stuff is a sum of Schur functions with first part larger than 3.  Possibly, this is because the ks3->s conversion doesn't understand that the kschur's do not form a basis for all symmetric functions; only for the span of schur functions with first part <= k.  I will look more at this and see if I can't put up a patch, but assistance is very welcome!

Sounds good.  You can assign such a ticket to me, if you'd like, so I can keep my changes to kschur.py organized (adding dual kschurs is probably next...)  Anyway, I agree that projection should be pretty easy.
