# Issue 4541: kschur functions don't properly convert to schur's

Example:

```
sage: ks3 = kSchurFunctions(QQ,3)
sage: s = SFASchur(ks3.base_ring())
sage: s(ks3(s([1,1,1,1])))
s[1, 1, 1, 1] + t^3*s[4]
```

In general, s(ks3(foo)) returns the_right_thing + bad_stuff  where bad_stuff is a sum of Schur functions with first part larger than 3.  Possibly, this is because the ks3->s conversion doesn't understand that the kschur's do not form a basis for all symmetric functions; only for the span of schur functions with first part <= k.  I will look more at this and see if I can't put up a patch, but assistance is very welcome!

Ignore my comments above.  This is maybe still a problem, but for a different reason.  The problem is that s([1,1,1,1]) doesn't live in the space spanned by the the ks3's.  So in cases like this, there are three choices for what ks3(f) should do (f symmetric, but not in the span of the ks3's):

1) Throw an error

2) Project f to the ks3's and return that answer.  This is the current behavior.

3) Do (2) but warn the user about it.

I'd vote for (1), but I'll see what sage-combinat-devel has to say first.

Hi Jason,

This looks good to me.  I'll make a new ticket for adding a method which does the projection.  This should be pretty easy as we can just add a flag to the change by triangularity method.

Michael,
whoops, sorry.  Thanks for fixing.


Mike,
Sounds good.  You can assign such a ticket to me, if you'd like, so I can keep my changes to kschur.py organized (adding dual kschurs is probably next...)  Anyway, I agree that projection should be pretty easy.
