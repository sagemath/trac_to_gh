<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I worked on this in Dec 08 and while the result is not perfect it does fix the immediate problems.  Mainly, finding the p-adic elliptic log of a point (on a curve over QQ) to specified precision may require the working precision to be increased.  [Simple example:  if the valuation of the discriminant is N then don't try changing the base field to Qp(N-1) as the equation will look singular.]

The fixes in the patch do two things: in a few places where it's clear that the precision must be at least something, then increase it to that thing.  Otherwise there is a lot of try/expect wrapping with the precision being doubled if necessary, both in the log function itself and in the (currently only) function which calls it, namely S_integral_points().

This code has been tested by running S_integral_points() on lots of curves in the database with a variety of sets S.

To help improve the p-adic log function, a new function for points has_good_reduction(self,P) has been defined.

The patch (trac_4805.patch) is based on 3.2.3.

file: ell_point.py
function: has_good_reduction
the docstring has_good_reduction allows P = None, but the code doesn't (and it's not doctested).

        if K is rings.QQ: 
            pi = P 
        else:
            pi = K.uniformizer(P)
occurs twice (1063 and 1077)


function: padic_elliptic_logarithm
docstring should change to reflect the new default precision 
The explanation for the precision should be clarified: it's not the precision of the result, rather something slightly less.  Even better: change the code so that the answer returned actually has the given precision.  You should also specify whether this precision is relative or absolute (it's probably absolute).  Using "absprec = 20" in the function arguments would clarify this.
Once the definition of precision is clarified, I think the ValueErrors be able to be eliminated (if you're trying to return an answer of a given precision, just increase the precision whenever you would otherwise hit a ValueError.

file: ell_rational_field.py
function: S_integral_points
The NOTE should be modified to take this patch into account.
line 5103: You shouldn't have bare except blocks.  Figure out what kinds of exceptions you want to catch, and list them explicitly.

All fair comments, what I provided was a deliberate compromise so that the application I wanted (S-integral points) worked instead of crashing, while not having time to do a proper and thorough job on p-adic elliptic logs.  I still don't and will not for another two months probably, so unless someone else wants to do the work required by the reviewer we'll keep shipping Sage with code which crashes.

Roed: Thoughts?

John,

can you make the easy changes that Roed requested and then open another ticket for the heavy lifting he wants implemented? I am willing to give this a positive review then and take the heat in case things go wrong :)

Hi,

It looks to me like John addressed all of David's comments.  He didn't make the output precision specified by prec, which would have required changing the algorithm, and that's fine by me (and in fact makes sense to me, given that it is clearly documented).

Assuming this passes all tests, I'm fine with it getting a positive review.

Doctests on sage.math do pass with both patches applied, so I am changing this to a positive review as indicated by William.
