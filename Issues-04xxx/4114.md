<a id='comment:1'></a>Attachment [trac_4114.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4114/trac_4114.patch) by mabshoff created at 2008-09-14 07:03:48

On an OSX 10.4 PPC box this patch fixes the issue:

```
varro:~/sage-3.1.2.rc2 mabshoff$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py                 
         [19.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```
But I am mystified why it did work on OSX Intel boxen. 

Cheers,

Michael
