One *major* issue that remains is that the lisp.py doctest hangs forever
on OS X ppc 10.5:

sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lie.py
        [5.5 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
**Attachment:** [trac_4114.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4114/trac_4114.patch.gz)

On an OSX 10.4 PPC box this patch fixes the issue:

```
varro:~/sage-3.1.2.rc2 mabshoff$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/interfaces/lisp.py                 
         [19.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```
But I am mystified why it did work on OSX Intel boxen. 

Cheers,

Michael
