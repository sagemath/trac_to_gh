This is definitely a bug, which could be fixed.  In the meantime, as a workround 
you might just do

"<p>Let  $a < b$.</p>"

since that will look better anyways.

```
I get the message 

```
NameError: global name 'cgi' is not defined

More importantly, when testing the problem reported here, I don't see a change in behavior: after editing the worksheet and typing

in between cells and saving, it looks fine, but when I click "Edit" again, the `&lt;` has turned into `<`, and it is printed wrong.

Mike's patch above breaks %html mode since it assumes you literally want "<" every time you write it.  That means you can't type `<b>hello</b>`.  I like it better the other way (before), that demanded that you type &lt; instead of <.

This is somewhat of a moot point now that TinyMCE is in.
