Standard fix (gp has a default precision of 38 on 64-bit architectures, and 28 on 32-bit).

There are more serious pari precision issues tracked at #4064.

I have looked into the matter of the second doctest failure more carefully and figured out that there were two problems with the function gp.new_with_bits_prec():

1. the code was doing the wrong thing

2. the doctest was testing the wrong thing (but the result was correct)

Basically, asking gp to print out pi was pointless because gp's precision had been reset to its default (so of course it would only print the first 28 or 38 digits).  The new patch fixes the code and the doctests.  I don't have access to a 64-bit machine so I had to produce the 64-bit doctest results by pure thought, so it would be great if someone could actually doctest this.
