This is with 3.2.1.alpha1-current. To reproduce do a "sage -ba" and have a Cython process fail. Then the next "sage -b" will not pick up with the Cythonization again, but start building extensions.

Deleting .cython_deps does not fix the problem.

Cheers,

Michael

The attached patch fixes the issue. The problem was that we were copying the files at one point in the code, and then running Cython later.
