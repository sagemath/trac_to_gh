sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_mod_p is very old.

The attached patch removes (but doesn't yet delete -- could you verify it can be removed, reviewer?) Polynomial_dense_mod_p and implements polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_modp_ntl_zz/ZZ using the newer techniques.

It makes basic arithmetic faster.  I was finding that arithmetic in `GF(next_prime(2^50))['x']` was slower than in `Zmod(next_prime(2^50)+1)['x']`, but now I cannot find the comparison!  In any case, this is much faster for doing gcd/xgcd in GF(p)['x'].
