That seems to be a problem of how Sage displays/prints permutation groups. Internally, everything seems fine. I just produced such a group and I get:

```
sage: B = species.BinaryTreeSpecies()
sage: a = B.structures([1,2,3,4,5]).random_element(); a
(1*5)*((2*3)*4)
sage: grp = a.automorphism_group()
sage: grp
Permutation Group with generators [(), ()]
sage: grp.list()
[()]
```
The latter two lines are pretty inconsistent.

I am fixing this by changing permutation groups to make their gens be canonicalized by default (meaning they are sorted and duplicates are removed).  This is *much* more in the spirit of Sage.  There is still the option to have the generators be exactly what is input (duplicates and all).
