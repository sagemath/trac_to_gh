Though seeing `SymbolicEquation` in parent.pyx is very scary at first, this is a good solution. :)

The above patch causes the following doctest failure in tut.tex:

```
There is one subtlety in defining complex numbers: as mentioned above,
the symbol \code{i} represents a square root of \minusone, but it is a
\emph{formal} square root of \minusone; it is not in the complex numbers.
Calling \code{CC(i)} returns the complex square root of \minusone.
%link
\begin{verbatim}
sage: i in CC
False
```
now returns true. After some discussion with William it was decided to change the doctest.

Cheers,

Michael
