Well, this is pretty low-hanging fruit, but I've just got too many things higher on my priority list (sage and otherwise). 

If no one else gets around to this, eventually I will. The code is there, it's just a matter of hooking it up and making sure it still works everywhere (and there might be some numerical noise as it handles polynomial multiplication in a more numerically stable way).
