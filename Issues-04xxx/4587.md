''I think nobody every implemented a "install latest version of package foo" 
yet for Sage.  That's been on the todo list for *years*. ''

It is not difficult to implement, using the existing functtions from sage.misc.package, namely `install_package` and `optional_package` etc.

I implemented a function `install_latest_version` in `package.py` and included it in `all.py`.

Now, one can install the optional pil-1.1.6 package with

```
sage: install_latest_version('pi')
```
Repeating the command yields the Traceback

```
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: There is no uninstalled package whose name starts with 'pi'.
```
Forced re-installation is then possible with

```
sage: install_latest_version('pi',forced=True)
```

If there is no possible package name extension, a Traceback results. There is also a Traceback if the extension is not unique. In that case, before raising the error, a list of all possible extensions is shown.

```
sage: install_latest_version('p',forced=True)
Possible packages are:
  palp-1.1.p1
  pari-2.3.3.p0
  pexpect-2.0.p1
  polybori-0.5rc.p5
  polytopes_db-20080430
  pycrypto-2.0.1.p2
  pygments-0.11.1
  pynac-0.1.1
  pyprocessing-0.52
  python-2.5.2.p8
  python_gnutls-1.1.4.p3
  pil-1.1.6
...
ValueError: There is more than one package name starting with 'p'. Please specify!
```

Or should this function not raise an error?

Unfortunately I have no idea how to have a non-destructive doc-test. Certainly it'd not be acceptable to have a doc-test installing something.


Unfortunately, I have no idea how a non-destructive doc-test may look like. Certainly it would hardly be acceptable to have a doc-test that installs something.

We could have an official "test" spkg.  And it would be marked

```
optional -- admin
```
meaning one must have write privileges to the sage install in order to run it.
The test would install and uninstall that package.

Sorry, at that point I have to pass out. So far, I did not produce a new package (hopefully I'll learn it soon), and also I don't how one can un-install a package.

Another idea: Call the test package `tomato.spkg`, and construct it such that the attempt to install it would actually have no effect. 

Hence, there were no need to mark it `optional -- admin`, and also no need to uninstall it. 

That package would just comprise a Makefile with the simple content

```
all:
    echo "Tomato ejects itself"
```

Would it work? At least it would be rather "pythonic"...

     Simon

I don't love the design, but a small change could fix it so I would like it.

Can you change it so install_latest_version is *not* exported to the global namespace.  Instead, if one calls install_package('...') with an input that doesn't contain a dash (i.e., doesn't contain any version number), then install_package simply calls install_latest_version.

The whole reason you wrote install_latest_version is because install_package is just really incompletely implemented, so just use it to implement the rest of install_package, and don't add more to the global namespace.

Fortunately you didn't review the patch that I had submitted a few hours ago. I was in a hurry, didn't test it, and had a mistake... 

But the current patch does what I announced. My tests: 
* I have pil installed. When I did `install_package('pil')`, it said that there is no package with that name (perhaps it would be better to say 'no uninstalled package').
* Doing `install_package('pil',True)` did a re-install.
* Doing `install_package('p')` showed a list of possible extensions and raised an error.

What do you think:
1. Is it ok that an error is raised if there is no (resp. no not-yet-installed) package?
2. Is it ok that an error is raised if the package name is not unique, or should simply the list be returned?

Yep, this is what I meant when I said in my previous comment "(perhaps it would be better to say 'no uninstalled package')".

The logic is:
* If force and there is a unique package then install it (regardless whether it is already installed or not)
* If (not force) and there is a unique *non-installed* package then install it.
* Otherwise, raise an error.

I agree that the error message may be clearer. So, back at work...

After applying the second patch:
If the name is non-unique, I get with force install:

```
sage: install_package('p',True)
Possible package names starting with 'p' are:
  palp-1.1.p1
  ...
  pyx-0.8.1
ValueError: There is more than one package name starting with 'p'. Please specify!
```
and without force:

```
sage: install_package('p')
Possible names of non-installed packages starting with 'p':
  phc-2.3.39.p0
  ...
  pyx-0.8.1
ValueError: There is more than one package name starting with 'p'. Please specify!
```

If the package exists, without 'force' I get:

```
sage: install_package('pil')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: Package is already installed. Try install_package('pil',force=True)
```

Is this better?

Remains the doc-test issue. I leave it up to you whether one should wait for the test_dummy.spkg, so, I keep the summary [with patch, needs work].

For this sort of thing, I'm not too worried.  100% coverage is critical in cases when it is at least reasonably straightforward how to write the doctests.  Here it is itself pretty confusing.
