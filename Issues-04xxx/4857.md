(see also the respective thread at sage-devel)

Although this spkg is pretty small, putting it in a trac ticket is probably not the best idea. But currently, I haven't got access to any other web space where I could place it.

Install with "sage -i exampleclib-1.0.0.spkg"; the documentation is the under

$SAGE_ROOT/devel/exampleclib/src/README.txt

$SAGE_ROOT/devel/exampleclib/src/doc/*

-1 by a wide margin. This spkg does numerous things badly and introduces many "features" we don't need or are completely overdesigned. The idea about spkg-install and its friends is KISS and this certainly isn't it.

The place to have this is not trac either.

Cheers,

Michael

MABSHOFF:

"I think in its current form 4857-examples.patch should not go in, in
fact it shouldn't go in at all IMHO.

4857-scripts.patch is too complicated IMHO, but salvageable."

So I change this to "needs work".
