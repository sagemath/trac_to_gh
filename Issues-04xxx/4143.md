The `injvar()` command has no docstring. Maybe depreciate it and use the docstring of `inject_variables()` ?

```
R = PolynomialRing( GF(Integer(2)), ['a%s'%i for i in range(Integer(93))] + ['b%s'%i for i in range(Integer(84))], order='degrevlex' )

R.injvar?
Type:           builtin_function_or_method
Base Class:     <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>
String Form:    <built-in method injvar of sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomialRing_libsingular object at 0xb1c32414>
Namespace:      Interactive
Docstring:
    <no docstring>
Class Docstring:
    <attribute '__doc__' of 'builtin_function_or_method' objects>
```
