I had to rebase the following hunk from the above patch:

```
***************
*** 10,24 ****
  from sage.structure.element cimport Element, ModuleElement, RingElement
  from sage.structure.element import parent
  
- # import the mpfr stuff from RealNumber becase it's included, not cimported
- from sage.rings.real_mpfr cimport mpfr_t, mp_rnd_t
- from sage.rings.real_mpfr cimport *
- 
- cdef extern from "mpfr.h":
-     int mpfr_mul_ui (mpfr_t rop, mpfr_t op1, unsigned long int op2, mp_rnd_t rnd)
-     int mpfr_div_ui (mpfr_t rop, mpfr_t op1, unsigned long int op2, mp_rnd_t rnd)
-     int mpfr_cmp_si (mpfr_t op1, signed long int op2)
-     int mpfr_cmpabs (mpfr_t op1, mpfr_t op2)
          
  cdef class PolynomialRealDense(Polynomial):
      
--- 13,19 ----
  from sage.structure.element cimport Element, ModuleElement, RingElement
  from sage.structure.element import parent
  
+ from sage.libs.mpfr cimport *
          
  cdef class PolynomialRealDense(Polynomial):
```

Other than that everything looks fine. 

Cheers,

Michael
