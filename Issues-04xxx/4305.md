Due to trouble when building the tree with the patch applied on sage.math, i.e. finite_field_givaro not being found, this patch unfortunately needs work :(

I will attach a reviewer patch shortly once I have proper net again.

Michael

Robert,

is anything going on here? I am not sure how much happened to the finite fields since SD 10, but that patch here certainly has gone stale. Should you plan to work on this in the short term please ping me so we can coordinate the big move. Otherwise we should delete the patches and wait until someone tackles this again.

Cheers,

Michael

Ok, I just think that a lot of this patch needs to be rebased, so it might be a good idea to start over, but we will see. One aspect that puzzles me to this day is that we never got it to work on any other system but your own.

One issue that likely will need addressing is pickling issues.

Cheers,

Michael
