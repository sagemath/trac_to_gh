phcpack uses a different method and different output for 1-variable problems, which breaks some assumptions in the interface.  

Attached patch trac_4411_and_10607_phc_fixes.patch fixes this problem and a recent change in phcpack output that breaks everything in the interface if not addressed.  This patch was added as part of ticket 10607, so that part is done.

Apply only the patche
[attachment:trac_4411-tmpfilename.patch].

and test AFTER installing the optional spkg at #10607.

Here's an example for testing:

```
R1.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
start_sys1 = [t^15-t-1]             
sol = phc.blackbox(start_sys1, R1, verbose=False)        
len(sol.solutions())
```
should give 15.

The new spkg (Marshall, could you post a link to it?) breaks parts of the current code, as some outputs(?) did change.

A few comments: the variable `real_tol` needs to be documented.  Also, the examples should probably be marked "optional: phc" instead of just "optional".

In the documentation it says "A dictionary of lists if dictionaries of solutions, classified by type.".  Should the word "if" be "of"?

You've changed the functions `get_solution_dicts` and `get_classified_solution_dicts`; can you add some doctests to illustrate and test the changes?
