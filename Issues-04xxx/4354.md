With the above patch and replacement sage script the example given should work and print 'ok'.

Be aware that if you copied the sage script somewhere (like /usr/local/bin) for convenience you need to modify that copy too.  The line near the end that reads 

```
"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" $*
```
needs to be replaced by

```
"$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sage" "$@"
```

Well, this time "sage-run" had changed in between 3.3.alpha0 and 3.3.rc0.

I carefully hand-edited the 3.3.alpha0 patch (which did apply to 3.3.rc0 "sage-sage" only, but no longer to "sage-run") to reflect these changes, so the HG changeset header with the credit stayed the same.

The resulting patch now applies cleanly against 3.3.rc0.

Hello Michael,

this should go in 3.3 now. Of the handful files above, you'll need two:

A) The third one "sage.2" to go directly (no repo!!) right under $SAGE_ROOT as "sage" to replace the older script of the same name there. Mind the usual file executable flag issues ;-)

B) The last one "trac_4354_rebase_3.3.rc0.patch" applies as a HG patch to /local/bin (Sage scripts) repo.

Then test (as the original ticket comment says) from the bash command line (say after "your_favourite_path_to/sage -sh"):

```
$ echo 'print "ok"' > 'test file.sage'
$ sage "test file.sage"
```

(This can hardly be a doctest, it's just outside scope --- and IMHO the issue of testing this kind of environmental stuff should not burden this ticket here, although it is a valid question.)

Merged sage.2 and trac_4354_rebase_3.3.rc0.patch in Sage 3.3.rc1.

I double checked both patches and I am confident they do the right thing.

Cheers,
