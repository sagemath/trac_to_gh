Looks good.  I have some questions about `_ensure_is_compatible()` in modform/element.py

1. I guess I don't quite know what the function is meant to be used for; the docstring says "compatible for arithmetic and comparison operations". I assume arithmetic here means addition or subtraction?

2. With the patch, two forms of the same weight but different groups of the same level are deemed compatible.  For instance, if f is on Gamma0(11) and g is on Gamma1(11), or if f and g are on Gamma1(17) but with different Dirichlet characters.  Is this the desired behaviour?

Ah, good point. I added a patch that changes it to test that they have the same ambient space, which is what the docstring claims.
