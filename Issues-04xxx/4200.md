Numpy 1.2.0 came out today.  An updated spkg is here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/numpy-1.2.0.spkg

Crazily, apparently some parts of numpy are deprecated and throw warnings, while other parts still use the deprecated functions.  The upshot is that Sage, upon importing scipy, displays several warnings about deprecated numpy stuff.  Also, using numpy, like in the solve_left function, triggers deprecation warnings about other parts of numpy.
