Once I've deleted the old `matplotlibrc` files from everywhere, as proposed in

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/11704ed70dc0d6e3

I get failures related to `ft2font`:

```
sage: from matplotlib import ft2font

ImportError: dlopen(/Users/rlmill/sage-3.3.alpha5/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/ft2font.so, 2): Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct

  Expected in: /Users/rlmill/sage-3.3.alpha5/local/lib//libpng12.0.dylib

```

Trying it again doesn't even give the error again: Sage just thrashes.

<div id="comment:14" align="right">Comment 14</div>

This spkg is twice as large as the previous:

```
-rw-r--r--@ 1 michaelabshoff  staff  4845513 Feb  2 17:28 matplotlib-0.98.3.p5.spkg
-rw-r--r--  1 michaelabshoff  staff  8833439 Feb  5 16:52 matplotlib-svn6821.spkg
```
There was some discussion on the matplotlib list about the new tarballs containing more documentation than the old ones, so we should look into getting rid of some of the documentation.

This spkg is important to get graph related plotting improvements into Sage, so let's try for 3.3.

Cheers,

Michael

I debugged this some more with rlm and the problem is the following:

```
OPTIONAL USETEX DEPENDENCIES
               dvipng: /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.frame

So killing dvipng support on OSX for now should solve the problem. His dvipng comes out of usr/texbin/dvipng.

Ok, the culprit is this extension: 

```
def build_macosx(ext_modules, packages):
    global BUILT_MACOSX
    if BUILT_MACOSX: return # only build it if you you haven't already
    module = Extension('matplotlib.backends._macosx',
                       ['src/_macosx.m'],
                       extra_link_args = ['-framework','Cocoa'],
                      )
    add_numpy_flags(module)
    ext_modules.append(module)
    BUILT_MACOSX = True
```
Since it links against a framework the only fix might be to fix the libpng.dylib issue on OSX once and for all.

On sage.math we are having problems with the tkagg backend. It used to happen only occasionally, but now it happens every time I doctest plot.py:

```
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/devel/sage/sage/plot/plot.py", line 172:

        ret =  gca().grid(*args, **kwargs)
      File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py", line 572, in gca
        ax =  gcf().gca(**kwargs)
      File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py", line 274, in gcf
        return figure()
      File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/pyplot.py", line 252, in figure
        **kwargs)
      File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.rc1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_tkagg.py", line 90, in new_figure_manager
        window = Tk.Tk()

        self.tk = _tkinter.create(screenName, baseName, className, interactive, wantobjects, useTk, sync, use)
    TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
```

We already disable tkagg on Itanium/Linux, so let's get rid of it globally.

Cheers,
