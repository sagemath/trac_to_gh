-rw-r--r--  1 michaelabshoff  staff  8833439 Feb  5 16:52 matplotlib-svn6821.spkg
```
There was some discussion on the matplotlib list about the new tarballs containing more documentation than the old ones, so we should look into getting rid of some of the documentation.

This spkg is important to get graph related plotting improvements into Sage, so let's try for 3.3.

Cheers,

```
def build_macosx(ext_modules, packages):
    global BUILT_MACOSX
    if BUILT_MACOSX: return # only build it if you you haven't already
    module = Extension('matplotlib.backends._macosx',

Since it links against a framework the only fix might be to fix the libpng.dylib issue on OSX once and for all.
