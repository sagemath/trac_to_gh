```
The fourth argument in the following routine is called 
"emission_symbols", while the INPUTS section reports "emission_state". 
hmm.DiscreteHiddenMarkovModel(A, B, pi=None, emission_symbols=None, 
name=None, normalize=True) 
n 
    INPUTS: 
        A  -- square matrix of doubles; the state change probabilities 
        B  -- matrix of doubles; emission probabilities 
        pi -- list of floats; probabilities for each initial state 
        emission_state -- list of B.ncols() symbols (just used for 
printing) 
        name -- (optional) name of the model 
        normalize -- (optional; default=True) whether or not to 
normalize 
                     the model so the probabilities add to 1
