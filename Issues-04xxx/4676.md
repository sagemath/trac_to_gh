```
This adds more built-in polytopes (more Archimedean solids) and some new methods such as the Gale transform, bipyramid construction, edge truncation, and perspective projection with (optionally) hidden faces invisible.  The Schlegel projection code has also been somewhat refactored to make it more general in the future.

Keywords: **polyhedra, polytopes**

Component: **geometry**

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Only two small stylistic points:

- Gale_transform() -> gale_transform()
- Schlegel_transform() -> schlegel_transform()

I don't think it's good style to have methods begin with a capital, even when they refer to a person's name.

Otherwise, I don't know since when I was familiar with the math involved.  I did look up references though, and everything looks good.

If the two points above are fixed, then I give it a positive review.
