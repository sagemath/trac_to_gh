The way element classes are chosen in `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py` goes very much against object oriented design, and is basically ugly. :)

Attached patch tries to clean up this file, moves the decision of element classes to the immediate parents, adds some tests, and unifies the `__call__` methods. This also makes it much easier to add support for specialized polynomial classes.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This patch causes the following trivial to fix doctest failure:

```
mabshoff@geom:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.alpha0$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py"        
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1912:
    sage: type(a)
Expected:
    <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial_generic_dense'>
Got:
    <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_dense_field'>
**********************************************************************
```
Unfortunately the following test

```
Trying:
    Integer(2)*P + Integer(2)*Q # indirect doctest###line 208:_sage_    >>> 2*P + 2*Q # indirect doctest
Expecting:
    (x^2 - 2*x + 1, y - 3/2*a*x + 1/2*a)
```
in sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/jacobian_morphism.py seems to loop forever - at least I killed it after it used 22 minutes of CPU time on the new sage.math.

Cheers,

Michael
