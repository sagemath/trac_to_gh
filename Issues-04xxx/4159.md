With sage-3.1.2 if you try to do sage -bdist it fails with weird libpng linking errors
and missing symbols.  This is when it tries to make a dmg. 

For the 3.1.2 binary, I'm just using tar for now until this is fixed.  The fix will
probably be to unset some dynamic library paths right before running the commands
in the sage-bdist script that create the dmg.

It turns out that this happens on *all* OS X machines, both 10.5 and 10.4 on both ppc and intel.  Basically "sage -bdist" is completely broken in sage-3.1.2 on OS X.

Yeah, I agree that the fix will be to unset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH right before actually calling hdiutil in sage-bdist. Very odd that a command line utility pulls in libpng symbols. Oh well.
