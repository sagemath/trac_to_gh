I don't care what anybody says, this is a BUG.  Either the command should immediately raise a NotImplementedError, or it should give meaningful output (e.g., not vector spaces of dimension 0!)

```
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,2)
sage: a.eigenspaces_right()

[
(1.68954005899 + 0.570924387184*I, Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Complex Double Field
User basis matrix:
[]),
(-0.0345737707895 + 0.485480056628*I, Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Complex Double Field
User basis matrix:
[])
]
```

We easily and quickly have the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in this case, so I don't see what the problem is:

```
sage: a.eigenvectors_right()

([1.68954005899 + 0.570924387184*I, -0.0345737707895 + 0.485480056628*I],
 [                    0.800587795941                     0.758354735061]
[  0.545800288485 - 0.24730795798*I -0.194687766428 + 0.622089036565*I])
```

Same comments for eigenspaces_left.

Note that oddly a.eigenspaces() gives a sensible answer though neither left nor right does.

```

This was due to be looked at during the Christmas holiday as part of the overhaul of linear algebra interfaces (see http://wiki.sagemath.org/LinearAlgebraSEP; there it lists the methods as okay, but I'm aware that problems exist in the different eig* functions of different data types, so each of those implementations was going to be looked at.  For example, I believe the SR eig* functions don't conform to the correct interface right now either).

Thanks for catching and taking care of this.

There already is a doctest which I think adequately covers the issue, but numerical error makes it so that it is marked #random.

Erring on the side of caution, my review patch probably ought to also be reviewed, as it changes code.

I am not sure that doctest should be random - if the result truly is #random, i.e. more than the last couple digits, there is something seriously wrong here.

Yep
