I don't care what anybody says, this is a BUG.  Either the command should immediately raise a NotImplementedError, or it should give meaningful output (e.g., not vector spaces of dimension 0!)

```
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,2)
sage: a.eigenspaces_right()

[
(1.68954005899 + 0.570924387184*I, Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Complex Double Field
User basis matrix:
[]),
(-0.0345737707895 + 0.485480056628*I, Vector space of degree 2 and dimension 0 over Complex Double Field
User basis matrix:
[])
]
```

We easily and quickly have the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in this case, so I don't see what the problem is:

```
sage: a.eigenvectors_right()

([1.68954005899 + 0.570924387184*I, -0.0345737707895 + 0.485480056628*I],
 [                    0.800587795941                     0.758354735061]
[  0.545800288485 - 0.24730795798*I -0.194687766428 + 0.622089036565*I])
```

Same comments for eigenspaces_left.

Note that oddly a.eigenspaces() gives a sensible answer though neither left nor right does.

```
sage: a.eigenspaces_right()

This has to do with the naming and aliases of methods in this and the parent class.

Note that the eigenspaces method is now inherited from the parent class, and does the right thing by giving a deprecation warning and calling the eigenspaces_left method.

The patch code looks good, but I haven't tested it (I should be able to get to this by the weekend, though).

This was due to be looked at during the Christmas holiday as part of the overhaul of linear algebra interfaces (see http://wiki.sagemath.org/LinearAlgebraSEP; there it lists the methods as okay, but I'm aware that problems exist in the different eig* functions of different data types, so each of those implementations was going to be looked at.  For example, I believe the SR eig* functions don't conform to the correct interface right now either).

Thanks for catching and taking care of this.

There already is a doctest which I think adequately covers the issue, but numerical error makes it so that it is marked #random.

Erring on the side of caution, my review patch probably ought to also be reviewed, as it changes code.

I am not sure that doctest should be random - if the result truly is #random, i.e. more than the last couple digits, there is something seriously wrong here.

> Erring on the side of caution, my review patch probably ought to also be reviewed, as it changes code.


Yep
