Merging the sage library with local changes can often break -upgrade. The new behavior would rename the sage-main directory if it wasn't pristine. 

See the end of http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5b566397731862d/e4b19771599e2afd?lnk=gst&q=3.2.2.alpha0#e4b19771599e2afd for the full discussion.

That sounds like a reasonable compromise.
