As pointed out on [this](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-nt/browse_thread/thread/f0a95b54181ba6c5) thread on sage-nt, it might be more reasonable to have `G.cusps()` return a list instead of a set (for `G` a congruence subgroup). In particular, seeing an ordered list as output makes it easier to look through.

The attached patch changes this return type, as well as making a few small fixes so that this is just as fast as before (or faster, in some cases). 

This patch depends on #4747.

Component: **modular forms**

Patch applied cleanly to 3.2.2.rc1 (after removing the e-acute in Thiery's name in sage/combinat/ranker.py).

All tests in sage/modular pass, as well as some other testing that I did.

Positive review!
