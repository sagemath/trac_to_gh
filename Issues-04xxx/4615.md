This is part of the project to replace clisp by ecl. The vote was at

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/450bb51e12fab1aa

Since it is already an optional spkg all that needs to be done is to patch deps and so on. Maxima should depend on boehm_gc.

The spkg is at

http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/boehm_gc-7.1.p0.spkg

Cheers,

Michael

REFEREE:

I confirmed that src exactly equals upstream from http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/

I checked that the package installs on OS X, and that the spkg-install, etc., looks good.  It took 44 seconds to build on my OS X box, which isn't too bad.

This gets positive review, though of course deps and install must be modified.  Add this to install:

```
BOEHM_GC=`$newest boehm_gc`
export BOEHM_GC
```

Modify deps by adding/changing:

```
$(INST)/$(BOEHM_GC): $(BASE)
	$(SAGE_SPKG) $(BOEHM_GC) 2>&1
```

Boehm is *not* a dependency for Maxima as the ticket description says.  Instead Boehm should be made a dependency for ECL when that is added, and then Maxima depends on ECL.

Yes, it is technically correct that ecl will depend on boehm, but making Maxima depend on it wouldn't hurt anybody.

One thing missing from William's remarks about deps is that additionally `$(INST)/$(BOEHM_GC)` needs to be added to the `all` target in deps.

Cheers,

Michael
