```
g=graphs.PathGraph(6)
g.show()
h = g.complement()
h.show()
```
The last command shows the original P_6, not the complement.  However, calling `h.edges()` seems to return the right results.  Also, `Graph(h).show()` shows the correct thing, I think.

The possible problem:

```
[22:40] <rlm_> jason- the position dict of the path graph is set
[22:40] <rlm_> use layout='spring'
[22:41] *** rlm_ is now known as rlm|afk.
[22:42] <jason-> rlm_: okay, so the pos dict just needs to be cleared when creating the complement, I guess.
```

This was actually a design decision -- if you take the complement, the vertices are in the same position, and you can see where the edges are and are not. Perhaps the path graph should have a more than one dimensional layout...

Since this is a design decision and not a bug, I'm invalidating the ticket. If you think it's a bad design decision, take it to the mailing list. If you think path graphs shouldn't layout in lines, make a new ticket.
