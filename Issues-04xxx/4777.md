18:18 < wstein> True
18:19 < wstein> Yep, Sage's is_prime_power function is just plain wrong.
18:19 < wstein> Great.
18:19 < wstein> I wrote that, I think... :-(
18:20 < wstein> sage: k = pari(n); k.ispower()
18:20 < wstein> (2, 1757630701017558763141032341047742794506161527817537960891)
18:20 < wstein> Oh, it's a bug in pari, actually.
18:20 < wstein> Since pari's ispower is guaranteed to give the maximal k such that x=n^k according
18:20 < wstein> to the docs.
18:20 < wstein> But it doesn't.
```

Pari's docs say this:

```
    ispower(x,{k},{&n}): true (1) if x is a k-th power, false (0) if not. If n is 
    given and a k-th root was computed in the process, put that in n. If k is 
    omitted, return the maximal k >= 2 such that x = n^k is a perfect power, or 0 
    if no such k exist.
```

So this is a bug in pari.  The short-term solution is to I think just factor that damned number at the end.  This obviously could be slow in general, but at least it will be right.  Plus add a note to the docs and post a bugreport upstream (but check latest svn pari first, since we use an ancient pari).  I've reported bugs in this ispower function in pari before, by the way, so it's a known offender.

BEFORE patch:

```
teragon-2:~ wstein$ sage

| Sage Version 3.2.1, Release Date: 2008-12-01                       |

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: n = 150607571^14
sage: n.is_prime_power()
False
```

AFTER patch:

```
sage: n = 150607571^14
sage: n.is_prime_power()
True
```

And I'm making this a blocker, since it is a situation where one can silently get very wrong answers.
