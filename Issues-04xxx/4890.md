I hate stuff like this:

```
*     B. D. McKay, nauty User's Guide (Version 2.4),
*         http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/.
Do you accept nauty's license agreement, listed above? (y/n)
```

and as an argument against it note that a _lot_ of stuff in optional isn't gpl compatible, is binary only, etc., but we never have any explicit agreements like the above for anything else.

This was done explicitly because Nauty is non-free. I would much rather move non-free stuff to its own repo than to just install it without pointing out the license.

What is "this"?

We are talking about spkg-install of the nauty.spkg.

I've put a new spkg here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/nauty-24b7.p1.spkg

It does much more than just fix the problem cited in the title of this ticket.  It also:

* Reorganize the spkg to the format we've standardized on.
* Create Mercurial repository.
* Make the install process way more robust with much better error checking.
* Support MAKE environment variable.

To test it you'll also need to use

```
export SAGE_CHECK=1
```
to have it run its test suite.

some comments:

1. David Joyner asked about gap, since Nauty is *also* in Gap-packages, so it also gets installed there.  Of course there, there is no stupid interactive message.

2. I know that the reason for the message is because it is not a "GPL-compatible license".  However, that can be said for several of the things in optional (gap-packages, openssl, kash3, graphviz), but none of the others have a stupid interactive message.

3. Even Debian doesn't have stupid interactive license agreements.  They have a "non-free" repo that every normal user justs adds (it's very easy to add), and henceforth one automatically has those packages available by default.

4. Why distinguish between GPL-compatible and non-GPL-compatible for whether or not we have an interactive message?

Even if we put things in a different repository, it won't in any way effect the user experience, since install_package(...) just queries all repositories.  It will make management of repositories more difficult.  

I view half the point of optional as being a place where we can put non-GPL-compatible code like nauty, but for which it is still very easy for users to install it.

I think interactive license agreements are annoying.    They are all done deliberately.

Nauty is free as in beer, but the free license it is under is not "libre" i.e., not OSI approved and not GPL-compatible.  Nauty's license is: "Permission is hereby given for use and/or distribution with the exception of sale for profit or application with nontrivial military significance." There are essentially no other restrictions.   

Since we have a fundamental disagreement here, this will need to be discussed on sage-devel and possibly voted on.
