Somewhere we should note the standard way to deal with getting the indices from a slice object is

```
range(*s.indices(size))
```

where s is our slice and size is the size of the object we are applying the slice to.  See #4974 for lots of other information and discussion of various ways to do this, converging on the above simply standard python.
