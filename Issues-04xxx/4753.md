One issue is that in the patch, it should actually be 

```
            sage: type(c)
            <type 'sage.matrix.matrix_modn_dense.Matrix_modn_dense'>
```

Also, I'm curious as to where the big speedup comes from?  For example,

```
sage: %time a*a
CPU times: user 3.13 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 3.13 s
Wall time: 3.25 s
100 x 100 sparse matrix over Finite Field of size 10007
sage: %time a._matrix_times_matrix_dense(a)
CPU times: user 0.16 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.16 s
Wall time: 0.17 s
100 x 100 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 10007
```

Is it because you have a faster, more specialized underlying data structure?  Wouldn't it make more sense to add an optimized `_mul_` method to matrix_modn_sparse and then have it do a normal (naive) conversion?

I saw the patch, changed the subject, but did ping William about whether this code was supposed to be reviewed yet and didn't get an answer, so my bad :(

Definitely *not*.  Much of the time would likely be spent with setting and inserting entries in the sparse output, which is an insanely expensive datastructure compared to the super-fast dense data structure. 

That said, obviously a fast sparse*sparse = sparse should also be implemented, which would just be an easy cut and paste from Matrix_rational_sparse.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I'm adding a second patch, which does two things: 

* cleans up the doctests for `_matrix_times_matrix_dense`
* provides a fast `_matrix_times_matrix_`, so that `a*b` is now fast for a sparse mod N matrix `a`.

Now it's ready for review.

As Michael pointed out, it wouldn't hurt to have some comparison code.

BEFORE:

```
sage: m = random_matrix(GF(10007), 100, 100, sparse=True)

sage: %time m*m
CPU times: user 3.36 s, sys: 0.03 s, total: 3.39 s
Wall time: 3.42 s
100 x 100 sparse matrix over Finite Field of size 10007
```

AFTER:

```
sage: m = random_matrix(GF(10007), 100, 100, sparse=True)

sage: %time m*m
CPU times: user 0.09 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.09 s
Wall time: 0.09 s
100 x 100 sparse matrix over Finite Field of size 10007
