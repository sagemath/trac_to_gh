The following illustrates that list slicing in Pari is ridiculously slow.

```
sage: time p=pari.prime_list(10^6)
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.09 s
sage: len(p)
1000000
sage: time c=p[0:]
CPU times: user 45.05 s, sys: 0.54 s, total: 45.59 s
Wall time: 46.20 s
```

The code responsible for this is in pari/gen.pyx (line 825 in sage-3.2.3) in __getitem__:

```
        elif PyObject_TypeCheck(n, slice):
            l = glength(self.g)
            inds = _normalize_slice(n, l)
            k = len(inds)
            v = P.vector(k)
            for i in range(k):
                v[i] = self[inds[i]]
            return v
```

There must be dramatically faster ways to do a list slice in pari than the above.

in GP I would do something like

```
u=start-step; v=vector(k,unused,p[u+=step])
```

but I don't know how to translate this...

otherwise for big blocks,

```
p.vecextract('"150..10000"')
```
might be faster
