If you have more variables, it will run out of memory instead (on a 32
bit installation).

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Here's a workaround:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: C = random_matrix(R,8,8)
sage: %time d = C.determinant()
CPU times: user 2.64 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.65 s
Wall time: 2.67 s
```

```
sage: %time d2 = R(C._singular_().det())
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.05 s
Wall time: 0.15 s
```

```
sage: d2 == d
True
```

So we need to call Singular instead of using the native code.
