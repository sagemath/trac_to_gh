```
Hi, I'm trying out SAGE for the first time, so I entered what you 
suggested (see above). 
Now, from the plot, it there seems to be no other roots between 0 and 2 
so I entered 
sage: find_root(x^2*log(x,2)-1,0, 2) 
and got the root = 0.0 
what am I missing here? 
TIA, 
AJG 
```
But note the following:

```
sage: find_root(1/(x-1)+1,0, 2) 
0.0 
sage: find_root(1/(x-1)+1,0.00001, 2) 
1.0000000000011564 
```

Cheers,

Michael

This is a critical bug and ought to be fixed in 3.3.

Note that #3870 might be a dupe of this bug.

It seems this is a problem with Scipy:

```
In [16]: def f(x):         
   ....:     return 1.0/(x-1.0)+1.0
   ....: 

In [17]: import scipy.optimize

In [20]: f(2)
Out[20]: 2.0

In [21]: scipy.optimize.brentq(f, 0.001, 2)

Better luck in 3.4.1. Unfortunately this either requires testing of the result of scipy or some deeper surgery in Scipy.

Hi, added two small validity checks:
1. If one of the endpoints is evaluated to NaN we seek a nearby point in the interval which can be evaluated.
2. If the value of the function at the root found is "large", raise an error that we could not find it.

I am not sure 1 is necessarily the best solution to this because what if you get a function that always evaluates to NaN as you increase/decrease the endpoints? For instance

```
sage: f(x) = 0.0 / max(0, x)
```
will be NaN for infinitely many values. So your current test means this runs forever:

```
sage: find_root(f, -1, 0)
```
(before it simply gave a wrong value).

Also, I think for 2 you should raise a `NotImplementedError` as I think that more accurately reflects the situation.

Thanks. Looks better now. A few more little things:

- `ticket 4942` -> `:trac:`4942`` in the documentation.
- Could you add the test from[comment:17](#comment%3A17).
- This change:
  {{{#!diff
        Traceback (most recent call last):
-           ...
+       ...
        NotImplementedError: Brent's method failed to find a zero for f on the interval
  }}}
- Instead of using `...` for imprecision, it would be better to use `# abs tol` (or a `# rel tol`).
- `if` statements do not need outer parentheses in Python, so remove them from `if (full_output):` and the outermost pair from the other `if` statement 4 lines down.
