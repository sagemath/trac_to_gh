Yeah, I think it would greatly help if users could send an env
variable that dumps the pexpect communication to a file. Currently I
have to debug some Singular vs. pexpect problems on Solaris, but I
guess with mhansen's help I will finally learn how to fix those
issues. But for random users out there a magic switch that gives us
logs and helps us hunt down "random" problems would be a great thing
IMHO.
