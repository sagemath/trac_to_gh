Based on the discussion at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/3ec4cc026e9c65bd, it would be great to merge the code found at http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1616 into the Sage library.  Several functions should probably go into the main graph library (e.g., the edge clique cover function), while others probably ought to go into a minimum_rank.sage file.

I am one of the developers and hereby give my permission to incorporate the code into Sage.  I will ask the other developers as well.

I don't think anything included in the core main sage library should go in a .sage file.  It should go in a .py file.
