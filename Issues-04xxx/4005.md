Attachment: **[trac_4005_sage-coverage.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4005/trac_4005_sage-coverage.patch.gz)**

This patch is motivated by

```
    def min_spanning_tree(self, weight_function=lambda e: 1,
                          algorithm='Kruskal',
                          starting_vertex=None ):
```
from sage/graphs/graph.py.

Positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
