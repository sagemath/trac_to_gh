```
As of version 3.1.2, plots are saved correctly in notebooks. Thanks to 
those that fixed it. However, I noticed that the formatting of cells 
beginning with "%hide %html" is not saved. I need to re-evaluate all 
of those cells to get the formatting back. Is this a bug in SAGE or 
does it have something to do with the web browser (Firefox 3.0.3 on 
Mac OS X 10.4)? 
Thanks again for the great effort! 

Stan

I've attached V3, which just uses `cell.html`'s `input_cls`.

Sometimes, evaluating a cell with `%hide` at its top doesn't hide it.  This is a separate problem, apparently

Positive review on this ticket.  Feel free to ignore V3.
