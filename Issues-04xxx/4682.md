Well, the idea of this ticket was to add all people and then close it. Since now the first dozen has been added I changed the subject.

Minh: You should open a ticket for the next batch of say a dozen people once you are ready to go.

Harald,

You also need to give the ticket a formal positive review. Then usually the release manager will close the ticket. For website tickets this might be handled slightly different.

One more thing: Minh, can you give us a listing which people were added in the patch? Since it is a reorg it is hard to follow. For future reference please post two patches in the future: One to move things around, one with the actual changes.

Cheers,

Michael
