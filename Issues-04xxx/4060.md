Dear All,

I have a question related to the polyhedra module.
When I define a polyhedron using float rather than integer
coordinates, I get a weird behavior from the vert_to_ieq function.
For example, if I type something like this:

p = [[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]]
vert_to_ieq(p, cdd_type="real") 

**Assignee:** somebody

**Keywords:** polyhedra

**Resolution:** fixed

OK, I think I have resolved this problem.  I added a doctest to the Polyhedron class to test this.
