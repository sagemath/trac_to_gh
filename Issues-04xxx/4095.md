```
ok, it isn't normalize, but a very small function called npWrite

void npWrite (number &a)
{
  if ((long)a > (npPrimeM >>1)) StringAppend("-%d",(int)(npPrimeM-
((long)a)));
  else                          StringAppend("%d",(int)((long)a));
}

This is set to the current ring
in numbers.cc
n->nWrite = npWrite;
It should just affect the output, so I think would be okay to change it.
