One way to fix this is to rename the file sage-ipy_profile.py which is likely a lot less pain long term.

Mike: any thoughts?

Yep, I looked at the file and I came to the same conclusion. I have "fixed" the issue by correcting the sage_scripts repo in the 3.2.1.a1 tarball manually for now, but will take care of this once I catch some sleep.

Cheers,
