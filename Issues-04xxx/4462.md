<div id="comment:0"></div>

In Sage 3.1.1,

```
implicit_plot(x^2+y^2-1,(x,-1.1,1.1),(y,-1.1,1.1),plot_points=100).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
produces a very nice circle.

In Sage 3.1.4, the same code produces a filled-in disc. Likewise, implicit_plot tries to fill in all curves;

```
implicit_plot(5*x^4-x^2-y^2,(x,-5,5),(y,-5,5))
```
looks odd.

The cause is contour_plot (called by implicit_plot): the default for the fill option is True. Feeding fill=False to implicit_plot produces the desired behavior:

```
implicit_plot(x^2+y^2-1,(x,-1.1,1.1),(y,-1.1,1.1),plot_points=100,fill=False).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

Component: **graphics**

The fix is easy: change line 2926 of site-packages/sage/plot/plot.py, which currently reads

```
@options(contours=(0,0))
```
to

```
@options(contours=(0,0),fill=False)
```

It looks like #4201 forgot to override that option of contour plot.  That's where the change was made.

I refereed that patch; my bad.
