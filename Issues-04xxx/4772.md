sage: w = random_matrix(GF(2),100)

sage: time w.determinant()

```

The fix - just compute the rank of the matrix, and if it is less than the nrows, then det is 0.  Otherwise det is 1.  Easy.  Right now, stupid generic code is being used.

BEFORE:

```
sage: w = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: time w.determinant()
CPU times: user 174.27 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 174.29 s
Wall time: 174.30 s
0
```

AFTER:

```
sage: w = random_matrix(GF(2),1000)
sage: timeit('w._clear_cache(); w.determinant()')
125 loops, best of 3: 5.48 ms per loop
```

For a speedup of a factor of a factor of over THIRTY THOUSAND (!):

```
sage: 174/(5.48*10^(-3))
31751.8248175182
```
