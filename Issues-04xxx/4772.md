sage: w = random_matrix(GF(2),100)
sage: time w.determinant()
CPU times: user 0.18 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.18 s
Wall time: 0.19 s

sage: w = random_matrix(GF(3),100)
sage: time w.determinant()
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s

```

The fix - just compute the rank of the matrix, and if it is less than the nrows, then det is 0.  Otherwise det is 1.  Easy.  Right now, stupid generic code is being used.
