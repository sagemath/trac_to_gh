This "feature" that I introduced years ago is incredibly confusing.  3 people at least got very confused by this in the last 3-4 days. 

To close this ticket:
1. remove this functionality from local/bin/sage-*test*

2. rewrite all the files that use this by tediously marking each optional line with #optional.   This is tedious, but it is much much clearer what is going on.  

Note -- only do this *after* apply #4583, which already does some of part 2 above.

NOTE: Some people want a 

```
# start optional
...
# end optional
```
system to allow for optional blocks. 

I'm not sure.  I think I don't like this.

One way to implement this though would be in sage-doctest when parsing the docstring if start optional appears, just mark everything # optional through to where end optional appears.  I guess.

The attached sage patches fix all missing # optionals after applying the scripts patch (the first one -- trac_4588-scripts.patch).  I also greatly improve the use of 

```
  # optional -- name_of_package
```
while I was at it.

However, note that this revealed some bugs in David Joyner's linear_code.py stuff.  See #5067. Thus I believe this patch should receive a positive review *despite* that after applying it suddenly four doctests will fail.   I've made #5067 a blocker.
