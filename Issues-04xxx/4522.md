```
Attached patch makes the following changes to improve the user interface of the polynomial classes:

* Remove .name() method, since .variable_name() already provides same functionality.
* make the .degree() function of univariate polynomials accept one argument,
  the generator, to be consistent with the .degree() of multivariate
  polynomials.
* Add an .is_monomial() method to univariate polynomials.


Component: **basic arithmetic**
