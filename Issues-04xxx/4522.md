Attached patch makes the following changes to improve the user interface of the polynomial classes:

* Remove .name() method, since .variable_name() already provides same functionality.
* make the .degree() function of univariate polynomials accept one argument,
  the generator, to be consistent with the .degree() of multivariate
  polynomials.
* Add an .is_monomial() method to univariate polynomials.

REFEREE REPORT:

This looks very good. Positive review *subject* to you posting an additional patch that puts the name method back in and has a deprecation warning with a doctest of this.  We'll delete that in a few months.

New version of the patch with the deprecation warning, and doctests for it.

I'm marking this positivie review, since William didn't state that he wanted to see the patch again. :)
