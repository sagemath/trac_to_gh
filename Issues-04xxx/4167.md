[published example of this bug](https://sage.math.washington.edu:8101/home/pub/27/)

Plotting 

```
x=srange(0, 1.1, 0.5)
w=srange(0, 1.1, 0.5)
xw = zip(x,w)
list_plot(xw, rgbcolor=(0.8, 0.8, 0), pointsize=40)
```
produces blue and brown dots.

Plotting

```
x=srange(0, 2.1, 0.5)
w=srange(0, 2.1, 0.5)
xw = zip(x,w)
list_plot(xw, rgbcolor=(0.8, 0.8, 0), pointsize=40)
```

4 yellow ones.

original report:

```
list_plot with a list of len == 3 produces 'random' point colors.
it works with len != 3.

i've created a worksheet on the milnix server, that shows the problem.
