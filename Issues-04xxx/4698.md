All subclasses of `sage.structure.element.Element` end up using `sage.structure.element.make_element` for unpickling. This design is very hard to maintain, especially when trying to keep backward compatibility with older pickles. 

Python's pickling protocol via `__getstate__()` and `__setstate__()` moves the implementation of pickling/unpickling to the subclasses. [1] Attached patch changes sage.structure.element.Element to use this protocol.
