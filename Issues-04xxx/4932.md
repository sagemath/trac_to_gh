Okay, apparently lu_factor and lu in the scipy library return two completely different things.

Some notes from some experimentation:

1. scipy.linalg.lu is usually significantly slower than scipy.linalg.lu_factor

2. scipy.linalg.lu_factor returns a much more compact answer

3. scipy.linalg.lu_factor returns an answer directly suitable for lu_solve, etc.

I say we cache the lu_factor results and then build the P,L,U from these results if needed.

The strictly lower triangular part of the returned matrix is the L, the upper triangular part is the U, so that the returned matrix is (L-identity)+U.

The pivot array gives the row swaps needed.  For example, the following code constructs the new order of rows based on the pivot array piv:

```
arr=range(size)
for i in range(size):
    arr[i],arr[piv[i]] = arr[piv[i]],arr[i]
```

The P matrix will then have a 1 in the (i,arr[i]) position (or the (arr[i],i) position...).

THE LU MATRIX RETURNED FROM lu_factor MIGHT BE TRANSPOSED!  It was in my case, for some reason.

I'm thinking of fixing this ticket as soon as I've got time for it.

At any rate, one piece of opinion:

- `solve_left_LU` should be removed (the current NotImplementedError has served as deprecation for over a year)
- `solve_left` should, for numerical types, take an `algorithm` argument to switch between different numerical methods for solving, where LU is one of them. `solve_left` should 
- By default, `solve_left` should use some iterative steps to ensure an error below a given treshold (and, say, fall back to QR etc.).

In addition, numerical matrices should have a `set_solve_algorithm` method. It is often known in the outer, calling code what kind of numerical algorithm is needed to solve a system, while some inner code might want to perform the actual call to `solve_left`. I.e. what algorithms perform well for a matrix is typically a property of the given matrix.

It appears "straight" LU decomposition in `SciPy/NumPy` will accept non-square matrices as input, while the LU-factor routine still requires square input.

Do we want to try to support non-square systems with the straight LU decomposition?  It would mean foregoing the built-in solve routine that extens the LU-factor decomposition, and possibly a decision would have to be made about what to cache:  square (very compact) or non-square (more general).

According to:

http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html#numpy.linalg.solve

The generic "solve" from `NumPy` uses LU decomposition anyway, via an LAPACK routine.

So it does not appear to me that `solve_left_LU` adds anything to `solve_left`?

Attachment [trac_4932-remove-solve-left-LU.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4932/trac_4932-remove-solve-left-LU.patch) by @rbeezer created at 2011-02-24 22:46:37

This routine needs lots of work, has been "Not Implemented" for a long time, and with two routines for solving systems available (#7852), this should be removed.  Patch does just that.

The point behind this patch is that the LU decomposition is cached in the matrix so that multiple solves using this matrix are much faster because you don't have to compute the LU decomposition each time.

OK, that makes sense, I was reading the code, not the doc string.  Three ideas:
