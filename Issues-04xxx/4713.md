<a id='comment:2'></a>You could also do this in the first example:

```
sage: m = vector(ZZ, 9, range(9)) 
sage: k.<a> = GF(9) 
sage: m.apply_map(k)
(0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2)
```

I think it would be nice to have a really simple first example, that requires much less knowledge of "abstract algebra".  Maybe the first example could be for engineers or something?

```
sage: m = vector([1,x,sin(x+1)])
sage: m.apply_map(x^2)
(1, x^2, sin(x + 1)^2)
sage: m.apply_map(sin)
(sin(1), sin(x), sin(sin(x + 1)))
```
