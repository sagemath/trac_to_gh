With the patch applied I get

```
sage -t  devel/sage/sage/combinat/partition.py              
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/tmp/partition.py", line 604:
    sage: Partition([]).dominates([1])
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
**********************************************************************
```

I assumed that at least the patched file would be doctested :(

Cheers,
