The following should work:

```
a=matrix(QQ,3,[1,3,4,3,2,3,6,4,5])
a[1,:]=a[0,:]
```

Instead, I get an error:

```

That's a lot of doctests; cool!  (Maybe some of them should be marked
as TESTS:, in case we ever get around to having that mean something...)

```
            key -- any legal indexing (i.e., self[key] works)
```
feels a little awkward... I had to read it twice to figure out what it
meant.  Maybe

```
            key -- any legal indexing (i.e., such that self[key] works)
```
would be better?

I think it's wrong that this works:

```
sage: M = matrix(3, 2, srange(6)); M[1] = 15; M
```
but this raises an exception:

```
sage: M = matrix(3, 1, srange(3)); M[1] = 15; M
```

A lot of your variables should have type Py_ssize_t rather than int;
your current code will give very wrong results on matrices with more
than 2<sup>31</sup> rows or columns (which could happen on a 64-bit machine).

Other than that, looks very nice!

grr, forgot to check the "replace" checkbox again.

So apply the following:

trac_4972-matrix-setitem.patch, then trac_4972-matrix-setitem-fixups.patch

Ignore both .2.patch files.

This second refresh corrects some "int" cdefs in misc_c.pyx
