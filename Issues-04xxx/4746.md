what if we added a tolerance option, which it would use in comparing the endpoint?  If you were within tolerance of the endpoint, you would compare as equal to the endpoint.

This is not the answer.  Look at this example:

sage: srange(0,1.1,0.1,include_endpoint=True)
[0.000000000000000,
 0.100000000000000,
 0.200000000000000,
 0.300000000000000,
 0.400000000000000,
 0.500000000000000,
 0.600000000000000,
 0.700000000000000,
 0.800000000000000,
 0.900000000000000,
 1.00000000000000,
 1.10000000000000,
 1.20000000000000]

That's not right no matter what.  The documentation says:
"        Return list of numbers a, a+step, ..., a+k*step,
        where a+k*step < b and a+(k+1)*step > b."
where a,b are the first two inputs.

Thus the implementation of srange is simply buggy because the person (me!) who implemented didn't take proper care of how floating point numbers behave.

To whoever works on this problem: I would also request that the options 'universe' and 'check' be documented (or removed).  The documentation for 'include_endpoint' should say something like "whether or not to include the right-hand endpoint" or "whether to include 'end' " or something.  (I mean, it's more or less clear that you will include `start` and the issue is whether `end` is included, but this could be phrased better, I think.)

Along these lines, what does 'include_endpoint=True' mean if `start+k*step` is never equal to `end`?  For example, is

```
srange(start=1, end=3.5, step=1, include_endpoint=True)
```
supposed to behave differently from

```
srange(start=1, end=3.5, step=1, include_endpoint=False)
```
My guess is no, but this could be clarified in the documentation.  ("whether to include 'end' if end == start+k*step for some k"?)

Finally, if you want to set a tolerance, would a default value of `step * epsilon` be good, for some choice of epsilon (e.g. 10^-5)?

Maybe one could use Numpy's arange() to do the heavy lifting.

The only problem is that coercing it back could impact performance.

**Attachment:** [4746-referee.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4746/4746-referee.patch.gz)

I had to rebase the patch (the added/removed lines are unchanged).  Also, three doctests failed in interact.py; William said in IRC to change the expected results:

```
 Should I just change the expected result?
<wstein> The Got definitely looks more sensible.
 So yes, do change the expected result.
```

Code looks good, all doctests pass.  Positive review.  Apply 4746-srange-rebased.patch and 4746-referee.patch.
