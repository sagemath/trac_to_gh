Using ZZ(0) as an element of the list passed to block_matrix appears to be a special case somehow and throws an exception rather than creating the matrix seems reasonable to me.

```
sage: i=MatrixSpace(ZZ,2,2)(1)
sage: i

[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: block_matrix([1,i,1,1])  # this works as I expect

[1 0|1 0]
[0 1|0 1]
[---+---]
[1 0|1 0]
[0 1|0 1]
sage: block_matrix([0,i,1,1])  # this doesn't ... why is 0 special
...
ValueError: Insufficient information to determine dimensions.
```
This feels to me like a hazardous inconsistency.

Perhaps I should also add that I don't really like that it just blithely assumes I want a square matrix (although I did in my actual usage).  Ticket #2429 addresses that issue more wholeheartedly.

I think that in the doctest you give there actually is insufficient information, because you can't deduce the width of the left blocks, so an exception is in my opinion the right thing to do there.

In the example in this ticket, it seems to break because it tries to deduce the block dimensions in a single pass through the cells. In this pass, it only determines the size of column 2 and rows 1 and 2. It might need multiple passes to find all information.

This breaks the following example:

sage: B = Matrix(ZZ,3,2,[1,2,3,4,5,6])
sage: block_matrix([0,1,B,1])

The problem is that it turns the 0 at the top into a 2x2 zero matrix while
it should be a 3x2 zero matrix, but that can only be deduced after processing the ones further on.

I tried to write a patch for this, but ran into some trouble with the last doctest:

```
        sage: B = matrix(QQ, 2, 3, range(6))
        sage: block_matrix([~A, B, B, ~A], subdivide=False)
        [-5/12   3/8     0     1     2]
        [  1/4  -1/8     3     4     5]
        [    0     1     2 -5/12   3/8]
        [    3     4     5   1/4  -1/8]
```

In this case there are no real columns as such, and I'm not sure how we should behave if there were an extra row with `'1 0'` below the `'~A B'` and `'B ~A'` rows. Should that give a 3x3 identity matrix and a 3x2 zero matrix, or a 2x2 identity matrix and a 2x2 identity matrix? Maybe undefined behaviour, or an exception?

My current attempt raises an exception for this doctest that the column widths are inconsistent.

Rebased patches apply fine and Sage builds.

However 3 doctests fail.  These can be traced to #10433 that snuck into 4.6.2.alpha1 while this was in-progress.  ;-)  Specifically one 2x2 block matrix built at line 2366 of `sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py`

Latest patch rearranges the block matrix construction to meet new requirements for more explicit lists for the block matrix.  I've cc'ed David Loeffler if he wants to check off on just that one change.  Passes all tests now in sage/rings.  All work here is on 4.6.2.alpha1.

Would somebody like to retest the whole package now?
