Using ZZ(0) as an element of the list passed to block_matrix appears to be a special case somehow and throws an exception rather than creating the matrix seems reasonable to me.

```
sage: i=MatrixSpace(ZZ,2,2)(1)
sage: i

[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: block_matrix([1,i,1,1])  # this works as I expect

[1 0|1 0]
[0 1|0 1]
[---+---]
[1 0|1 0]
[0 1|0 1]
sage: block_matrix([0,i,1,1])  # this doesn't ... why is 0 special
...
ValueError: Insufficient information to determine dimensions.
```
This feels to me like a hazardous inconsistency.

Perhaps I should also add that I don't really like that it just blithely assumes I want a square matrix (although I did in my actual usage).  Ticket #2429 addresses that issue more wholeheartedly.

The problem is that it turns the 0 at the top into a 2x2 zero matrix while
it should be a 3x2 zero matrix, but that can only be deduced after processing the ones further on.

Looks real nice.  I've added some edits in a reviewer patch.

I'll run full tests overnight (with reviewer patch), and then will be ready to give this a positive review (subject to acceptance of my reviewer edits).

Rebased patches apply fine and Sage builds.

However 3 doctests fail.  These can be traced to #10433 that snuck into 4.6.2.alpha1 while this was in-progress.  ;-)  Specifically one 2x2 block matrix built at line 2366 of `sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py`

Latest patch rearranges the block matrix construction to meet new requirements for more explicit lists for the block matrix.  I've cc'ed David Loeffler if he wants to check off on just that one change.  Passes all tests now in sage/rings.  All work here is on 4.6.2.alpha1.

Would somebody like to retest the whole package now?
