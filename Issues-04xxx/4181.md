On both my Mac OS X 10.4 / Xcode 25 boxes, one Intel and one PPC, the following Sage code runs through fine (hit return twice):

```
sage: for p in prime_range(32768, 100000):  EllipticCurve(GF(p),[0,1,1,10,13]) 
```
Please note that the length of the interval is almost 70000, so quite some primes are involved.
But if the startpoint of the range is lower the 32768, then Sage crashes, e.g. for:

```
sage: for p in prime_range(31300, 32600):  EllipticCurve(GF(p),[0,1,1,10,13]) 
```
(note that the length of the interval is only 1300) one gets the following message with sage crashed:

```
error: no more memory
System 8672k:8672k Appl 8233k/438k Malloc 4030k/33k Valloc 4608k/404k Pages 1071/81 Regions 9:9

halt 14
```

The problem/bug can't be due to low physical RAM, or due to not enough virtual RAM for processes, since then the first line of code would have to crash, too. Which is not the case.

It is not related to the mathematical code, since if the length of the interval of primes is only 100 or less, the code runs fine for startpoints above and (!) below 32768.

The bug is triggered also if consecutively several small intervals (below 32768) are calculated, so it seems to be some caching / stack / heap / whatsoever related issue.
It does not seem to occur on platforms other than Mac (OS X 10.4 only?), so I put this under the "porting" issues.

As expected nothing bad happen under valgrind on 64 bit, but I will take a closer look with valgrind running on a 32 bit Linux box. It seems too much of a coincidence to not be related to something close to `2^15-1` or thereabout.

Well, what shall I say: apply the two patches (the one from #5344 and this one), and the long standing "long" doctest for "ell_finite_field.py" now succeeds on sage 3.3, finally:

```
sage -t -long "local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_finite_field.py"
         [53.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 53.9 seconds
```

I'll test 666 rings (#3760) in a minute.

Replying to [@sagetrac-GeorgSWeber](#comment%3A6):
> Sure, let's close dupes.

Absolutely.

For the record: It only became clear two or maybe three days ago that all these problems on OSX were related to libSingular+mmap, so back in the day when this ticket was opened it was the correct way to do so.

Too bad this path series is being held up by the minpoly bug, but I am hoping someone will fix that issue soon, too.

Cheers,

Michael
