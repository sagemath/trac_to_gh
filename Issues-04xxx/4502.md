(This has only been reported on intel macs running 10.4 or 10.5.)

From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/fae59a9a9a53b8c0):

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF,3,range(1,10));A

[1.0 2.0 3.0]
[4.0 5.0 6.0]
[7.0 8.0 9.0]
sage: A.determinant()
0.0
sage: -A

[-1.0 -2.0 -3.0]
[-4.0 -5.0 -6.0]
[-7.0 -8.0 -9.0]
sage: b = A.numpy(); b

array([[ 1.,  2.,  3.],
       [ 4.,  5.,  6.],
       [ 7.,  8.,  9.]])
sage: import scipy
sage: import scipy.linalg
sage: scipy.linalg.det(b)
0.0
sage: scipy.linalg.inv(b)

array([[ -4.50359963e+15,   9.00719925e+15,  -4.50359963e+15],
       [  9.00719925e+15,  -1.80143985e+16,   9.00719925e+15],
       [ -4.50359963e+15,   9.00719925e+15,  -4.50359963e+15]])
```

This leads to a doctest failure for `matrix_double_dense.py`.

Keywords: **numerical noise, matrix**

But please someone have a look if it is worth the price paid.

It fixes the doctest failure for me, too.  One or two questions:

Could the error message 

```
raise ValueError, "self must be square" 
```
be changed to something like "matrix must be square"?  Actually, why is this here?  I get an error message about non-square matrices (I think produced by scipy) before applying the patch.

Just changes the failing doctest (and only that single one) to be #random, and should apply cleanly against Sage 3.2.rc1. Now on my box, the doctest for this file passes.

Hi John,
>Could the error message


```
raise ValueError, "self must be square" 
```
>be changed to something like "matrix must be square"? Actually, why is this here? I get an error message about non-square matrices (I think produced by scipy) before applying the patch.

This test and error message were copied verbatim from lines 759/760 of that same file (function "def determinant(self)"). In my first patch, I introduced the additional calculation of the determinant in the function for inverting the matrix, and I wanted to make sure that all necessary sanity checks were in place.

Would it be possible for you to provide not only a concrete wording, but a new trac ticket with patch, if you like some other wording better for that error message? I'll review it then.

Strange. So does this mean the doctest passing as follows:

```
susanne-webers-computer:~/Public/sage/sage-3.2.rc1/devel/sage georgweber$ sage -t sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
sage -t  devel/sage-test2/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
         [4.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.2 seconds
```
is not enough here? I'm a bit puzzled, which exception exactly gets "thrown nevertheless" and when? I'm fine with nuking the doctest and postponing the issue till scipy 0.7 is there and included, I ask just out of curiosity.

Ahhh, sorry for the noise --- the exception does not fly on my box because my box believes the matrix would be invertible and provides an inverse matrix --- but on other computers the matrix is not invertible and there, the exception comes up.

Would that not be an issue to enhance the "#random" pragma then?

More precisely: Allowing on certain boxes the calculation to finish (but throw away the result), and on other boxes having an exception (but again throwing the outcome)?

Just point out to me the respective parts of the IRC conversation if all that info is in there ... and if you find the time and have patience to do so ... ;-)

The issue is the following:

```
[10:34am] wstein|afk: mabshoff -- all that #random does is the following.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo # random
[10:35am] wstein|afk: gets replaced by
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: _ = foo
[10:35am] wstein|afk: That's it.
[10:35am] mabshoff: mhh
[10:35am] wstein|afk: So it won't work at all with exceptions.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: Better might be:
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo # random
[10:35am] wstein|afk: gets replaced by
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo
[10:35am] wstein|afk: ...
[10:35am] wstein|afk: If that worked.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: I didn't know about ... when I wrote # random.
```
The goal now is to get 3.2 out and the easiest way to do this is to nuke the affected doctests and then deal with `#random` properly in 3.2.1.

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, but two things:

* a comment would be nice that the issue needs to be fixed with a reference to the ticket
* The other test right before, i.e. "sage: A.inverse().det()" also needs to be commented out

Once the above two happen with a new patch I will give this a positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
