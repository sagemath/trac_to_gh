(This has only been reported on intel macs running 10.4 or 10.5.)

From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/fae59a9a9a53b8c0):

```
sage: A = matrix(RDF,3,range(1,10));A

[1.0 2.0 3.0]
[4.0 5.0 6.0]
[7.0 8.0 9.0]
sage: A.determinant()
0.0
sage: -A

[-1.0 -2.0 -3.0]
[-4.0 -5.0 -6.0]
[-7.0 -8.0 -9.0]
sage: b = A.numpy(); b

array([[ 1.,  2.,  3.],
       [ 4.,  5.,  6.],
       [ 7.,  8.,  9.]])
sage: import scipy
sage: import scipy.linalg
sage: scipy.linalg.det(b)
0.0
sage: scipy.linalg.inv(b)

array([[ -4.50359963e+15,   9.00719925e+15,  -4.50359963e+15],
       [  9.00719925e+15,  -1.80143985e+16,   9.00719925e+15],
       [ -4.50359963e+15,   9.00719925e+15,  -4.50359963e+15]])
```

This leads to a doctest failure for `matrix_double_dense.py`.

Well, this makes the doctest failure go away on my Intel Mac. (I followed the proposal from Jason.)

But please someone have a look if it is worth the price paid.

This test and error message were copied verbatim from lines 759/760 of that same file (function "def determinant(self)"). In my first patch, I introduced the additional calculation of the determinant in the function for inverting the matrix, and I wanted to make sure that all necessary sanity checks were in place.

Strange. So does this mean the doctest passing as follows:

```
susanne-webers-computer:~/Public/sage/sage-3.2.rc1/devel/sage georgweber$ sage -t sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
sage -t  devel/sage-test2/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx
         [4.2 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.2 seconds
```
is not enough here? I'm a bit puzzled, which exception exactly gets "thrown nevertheless" and when? I'm fine with nuking the doctest and postponing the issue till scipy 0.7 is there and included, I ask just out of curiosity.

<a id='comment:13'></a>Ahhh, sorry for the noise --- the exception does not fly on my box because my box believes the matrix would be invertible and provides an inverse matrix --- but on other computers the matrix is not invertible and there, the exception comes up.

Would that not be an issue to enhance the "#random" pragma then?

More precisely: Allowing on certain boxes the calculation to finish (but throw away the result), and on other boxes having an exception (but again throwing the outcome)?

Just point out to me the respective parts of the IRC conversation if all that info is in there ... and if you find the time and have patience to do so ... ;-)

<a id='comment:14'></a>The issue is the following:

```
[10:34am] wstein|afk: mabshoff -- all that #random does is the following.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo # random
[10:35am] wstein|afk: gets replaced by
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: _ = foo
[10:35am] wstein|afk: That's it.
[10:35am] mabshoff: mhh
[10:35am] wstein|afk: So it won't work at all with exceptions.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: Better might be:
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo # random
[10:35am] wstein|afk: gets replaced by
[10:35am] wstein|afk: sage: foo
[10:35am] wstein|afk: ...
[10:35am] wstein|afk: If that worked.
[10:35am] wstein|afk: I didn't know about ... when I wrote # random.
```
The goal now is to get 3.2 out and the easiest way to do this is to nuke the affected doctests and then deal with `#random` properly in 3.2.1.

Cheers,

Michael

<a id='comment:17'></a>Yes, but two things:

* a comment would be nice that the issue needs to be fixed with a reference to the ticket

Once the above two happen with a new patch I will give this a positive review.
