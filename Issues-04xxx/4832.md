Right now, running `search_src` from the command line with a single argument prints the sage banner as well as the search results.  If you include more than one argument, then the banner is not printed. (This isn't true if there enough results to feed into the pager.)  The same goes for `search_doc`.  The reason is that these functions all call `sage -grep` which prints the banner, but including an extra argument calls grep on the output, and the banner won't match.  The function `search_def` doesn't have this problem, because it just calls `search_src` with an extra argument "def".

Here's an example:

```
sage: search_src('noncommutative')
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.2.2.rc1, Release Date: 2008-12-17                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
algebras/quaternion_algebra.py:        Return False always, since all quaternion algebras are noncommutative and all fields are commutative.
algebras/quaternion_algebra.py:        Return False always, since all quaternion algebras are noncommutative and integral domains are commutative (in SAGE).
matrix/matrix_space.py:commutative or noncommutative ring.
matrix/matrix0.pyx:        EXAMPLE of matrix multiplication over a noncommutative base ring:
matrix/matrix0.pyx:        EXAMPLE of scalar multiplication in the noncommutative case:

sage: search_src('noncommutative', 'ring')
matrix/matrix_space.py:commutative or noncommutative ring.
matrix/matrix0.pyx:        EXAMPLE of matrix multiplication over a noncommutative base ring:

```

The attached patch prevents the banner from printing by temporarily setting the environment variable SAGE_BANNER to be "no".
