Hi,

in the beginning list of the 40 contributors, the name "Nicolas Thiery" is misspelled.
("i" and "e" are interchanged). Apart from that, positive review from my side.

**Attachment:** [Sage-3.2.2-release-notes-final.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4829/Sage-3.2.2-release-notes-final.txt)

Some bits of the 3.2.3 release notes slipped into the 3.2.2 release notes, so I removed them. This was also merged in **3.2.2**, not **3.2.3**.

Cheers,

Michael
