Hi,

in the beginning list of the 40 contributors, the name "Nicolas Thiery" is misspelled.
("i" and "e" are interchanged). Apart from that, positive review from my side.

Some bits of the 3.2.3 release notes slipped into the 3.2.2 release notes, so I removed them. This was also merged in **3.2.2**, not **3.2.3**.

Cheers,

Michael
