The docstring for notebook() could use a bit of improvement. In particular, the `directory` option should be clearer. I also think we should *not* say "do a web search for more details"; if the information is too much for the docstring, we should make a page on the wiki and point users to that.

Also, given the recent forkbomb on sage.math, the `-u` flag for ulimit should be documented.

I plan to work on this during this week's Bug Day.

Patch attached. A lot of it is reformatting and typos, but I also added a reference to a new page on the wiki: http://wiki.sagemath.org/StartingTheNotebook. The installation guide only has a page on running a publically-accessible notebook server (http://sagemath.org/doc/inst/node10.html) and nothing on other single-user cases.

Also, that page on the installation guide is outdated; someone should go through and fix it up, and perhaps add something on using virtual machines, which these days seems to be the way to go; I have a start at that at http://wiki.sagemath.org/DanDrake/JustEnoughSageServer.

Oops. Sorry. I keep doing `qdiff` when I mean `export qtip`.
