The docstring for notebook() could use a bit of improvement. In particular, the `directory` option should be clearer. I also think we should *not* say "do a web search for more details"; if the information is too much for the docstring, we should make a page on the wiki and point users to that.

Also, given the recent forkbomb on sage.math, the `-u` flag for ulimit should be documented.

I plan to work on this during this week's Bug Day.
