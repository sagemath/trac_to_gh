[3:57pm] craigcitro: wstein: so i'm only here for 3 seconds between xmas decorating, but i had a thought
[3:57pm] craigcitro: the dependency checking code in setup.py seems to be causing a lot of heartache
[3:57pm] craigcitro: so why don't we just not cache it? it still only takes like .6 seconds to build the whole dependency tree
[3:58pm] mabshoff: +1
[3:58pm] craigcitro: and if it build fresh every time, we'll avoid a ton of these issues
[3:58pm] craigcitro: and then when i have time to sit down and debug a bunch of these crazy situations, we can add it back in
[3:58pm] craigcitro: just comment out all the lines about pickle/unpickle/etc in setup.py
[4:00pm] ghtdak1 left the chat room. (Remote closed the connection)
[4:00pm] craigcitro: mabshoff: do you want to make a patch that does that for rc0?
[4:00pm] craigcitro: and see how it works out?
[4:00pm] craigcitro: i have to run right now -- getting the tree out of the car and putting up xmas lights. 
[4:00pm] mabshoff: I will put it on my list, but no promises.
```
One problem I see is that currently deleting the Cython cache triggers a full rebuild, so that need to be considered. 

Cheers,

Attachment: **[trac_4645_4647.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4647/trac_4645_4647.patch.gz)**

This patch covers #4645 as well as this ticket #4647. I did the minimally invasive version to make reenabling the caching code as simple as possible.

Once this patch is applied it survives:

* a sage -b after deleting the Cython cache file
* a sage -ba
* a sage -b after applying the patch from #4206 - which caused us to disabled the caching for now.

Cheers,

Michael

Two more data points:

* disabling the caching adds a little less than a second to each "sage -b" run
* reverting #4206 and then running sage -b again leads to a working Sage
