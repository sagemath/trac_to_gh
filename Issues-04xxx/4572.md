Internally, maxima uses floating point numbers internally unless explicitly told to use bigfloats (which we don't, and there's only one global precision in maxima so it will be non-trivial to try and do this consistantly). This patch changes the parsing code to use RDF instead, which is a better reflection of the underlying precision.

In addition, this has the benefit of removing the trailing zeros in calculus expressions involving real numbers (as they didn't really contain any information). 

Component: **calculus**
