Internally, maxima uses floating point numbers internally unless explicitly told to use bigfloats (which we don't, and there's only one global precision in maxima so it will be non-trivial to try and do this consistantly). This patch changes the parsing code to use RDF instead, which is a better reflection of the underlying precision.

In addition, this has the benefit of removing the trailing zeros in calculus expressions involving real numbers (as they didn't really contain any information).
