Replying to [robertwb](#comment%3A13):
> Sage 3.3 compiles, starts, and exits without errors or segfauting with the attached patch, and the latest spkg. 

Awesome. Is that also with the refnanny enabled?

I also saw something being fixed today in regard to another reference leak, so I am interesting in trying this.

How close is this to being ready? I don't want this in 3.4 for obvious reasons, but 3.4.1 seems like a strong possibility.

Cheers,

Michael

Starting from Sage 3.4, I applied the patch, installed the Cython spkg, did "sage -ba", and did a full test run -- all tests passed.  Also, I read the patch, and it looked entirely reasonable.

So, positive review on the patch.  I did take a quick look at the spkg, but I didn't look closely enough to feel comfortable giving it a review; I did notice a couple of problems, though:

1) SPKG.txt has a mixture of line endings: some lines end with CR, some with LF

2) "cython -V" doesn't believe it's 0.11 final:

```
sage$ cython -V
Cython version 0.11.rc3
