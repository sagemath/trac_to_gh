IntegerListsLex refactoring, and application to Partitions

- Reworked the integer lists lexicographic generator into a full
  featured combinatorial class IntegerListsLex
- support for n in a set (or any iterable `I` implementing `n in I`)

Applications to Partitions:
- Systematic use of IntegerListsLex to get constant amortized time
  iterators (huge efficiency improvement).
- This includes PartitionsGreatestEQ and PartitionsGreatestLE which
  were previously implemented in GAP. This was inefficient due to
  the communication overhead, and not using an iterator.
  (backward compatible unpickling)
- Implements horizontal_border_strip.

I've added a patch which adds some doctests, adds a warning when min_part=0 is passed to partitions, and changed the default implementation of count to use Integers so that we don't have to reimplemented in IntegerListsLex

Assuming someone okay's my changes, I think both patches are good to go in.

Good.

We still do! Sorry, I did not comment on this in the code, but the implementation of count differs from
the default one from CombinatorialClass, as it bypasses the call to _element_constructor_!

I am cleaning up the 3.3 milestone. If a patch with positive review is put up to this ticket on time it might make it into 3.3.

Dear Nicolas,

> I should mention: only the last patch is needed; it integrates the previous ones

The patch looks good to me. However, though I'm not 100% sure I launched the correct check, it seems that one of the old pickle is still broken:

```
sage: std = os.environ['SAGE_DATA'] + '/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2'
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(std)
** failed:  _class__sage_combinat_partition_Partitions_constraints__.sobj
/usr/local/sage/sage/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/IPython/iplib.py:2073: DeprecationWarning: RQDF is deprecated; use RealField(212) instead.
  exec code_obj in self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns
Failed:
_class__sage_combinat_partition_Partitions_constraints__.sobj
Successfully unpickled 486 objects.
Failed to unpickle 1 objects.
```
Am I doing something wrong ?

Cheers,

Florent

I added a review patch which should fix this remaining pickle problem. If someone reread it I'm ready to give a positive review.

Thanks Florent for the fix. I had overlooked this pickle. 
Oh, and thanks for pointing out how one can test backward compatibility unpickles :-)

I tried the patch on my machine and it looks and works fine.

So, I allow myself to set the positive review  flag on behalf of Florent!

I also lifted the priority to major, since this gives a large (memory) efficiency gain.
