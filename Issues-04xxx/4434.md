When doing a graphical 3-way merge under OS X, hgmerge is missing so one gets infinite loops or errors.  This is a major problem.

The spkg here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/mercurial-1.01.p2.spkg

does the following:

* Added custom hgmerge script for OS X. For some reason no script at all was 
  copied over, which lead to (1) hg merge silently failing painfully for most
  users, and (2) for users that run install_scripts, they would get a fork
  bomb, since hgmerge would call sage -hgmerge which would call hgmerge 
  ad infintum.
