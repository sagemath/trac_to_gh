Our documentation should be clearly licensed.

```
15:09 < hampton|home> what is the license of the sage documentation?
15:09 < hampton|home> is it a type of creative commons?
15:11 < ddrake> hrm, I dunno. It should be, I think.
15:13 < ddrake> yep: by-sa
15:13 < ddrake> http://sagemath.org/doc/tut/node1.html
15:14 < hampton|home> that's the tutorial - are they are under that?
15:14 < hampton|home> the others don't have a notice I think
15:14 < ddrake> the installation guide and constructions don't have a notice
15:15 < ddrake> ref manual is attribution-sharealike
15:15 < ddrake> programming guide too
15:15 < hampton|home> cool, thanks

Actually, href will not work for a few reasons. 

(1)  The href (or whatever it's called) package is commented out, so it won't compile. 

(2) But I think the href latex package somehow conflicts with the Python doc latex package (?), and uncommenting it doesn't work either. (After moving to rest/sphinyx is this an issue?)

The solution is easy though - use \url{...} instead. It is used in other places in const.tex and inst.tex as well. If you just swap href with url it compiles fine and I'll give this a positive review.

We should definitely license the rest of the documentation, too. Positive review to trac_4809_other.patch.

I'll also open a French version of this ticket. I'm sure I could cut and paste something into the French tutorial, but I'll let one of our Francophone developers handle that.

I'm changing the milestone to 3.4.2 since these are not big or invasive patches, and should get in as soon as possible.
