This is for the file formal_group.py. Note that adding a s == loads(dumps(s)) test revealed a
failure:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: F = E.formal_group()
sage: F == loads(dumps(F))
False
```

Patch looks good and applies ok.  But as Paul says, we need to see why load(dumps(F))!=F for a formal group F.

I don't know how to fix this.

I didn't know, but now I do.  There was nothing wrong with loads() or dumps() for formal groups, but they were missing a `_cmp_` function so the "==" comparison was not giving the expected answer.
The second patch (modelled on a similar one by robertwb for ell_tate_curve.py) seems to do the trick.  All tests pass in elliptic_curves.

Yes, that looks good to me. (As does the other patch--though I only read it at SD 10, I didn't actually try it out yet).
