Hi,

the files

* ell_modular_symbols.py
* ell_tate_curve.py
* padic_lseries.py
* sha_tate.py

are not only enhanced in a vital way but also considerably cleaned up docstring- and comment-wise by #4667. The patch there is currently based against 3.3 and needs a rebase concerning two files (ell_rational_field.py, padocs.py) against 3.4 series, and there is still one doctest failure, but nevertheless I do consider #4667 worth of applying before working on this very ticket here!

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I have attached a patch trac_4933-1.patch which does this for three files:
* ell_number_field.py
* ell_torsion.py
* ell_point.py
which is a start.

The patch rewrites all the docstrings in those files and also adds them to the list of files which are processed by "sage -docbuild reference" so that they show up in the reference manual.

To review/test the patch (which was based on 3.4.1.rc2), you need to apply it and rebuild, and then (1) do  "sage -t" is usual on the files affected, and (2) do "sage -docbuild reference pdf/html/whatever" to check that the documentation looks good.

The patch trac_4933-3.patch converts the following to rest/sphinx and adds them to the reference manual:
* ell_number_field
* ell_local_data
* ell_torsion
* ell_point
* period_lattice
* weierstrass_morphism
as well as fixing some glitches in other files (notable ell_rational_field) and adding a few doctests.

Almost all the changes are in docstrings.  To review this you'll have to build the docs (reference manual) and eyeball the output.

NB I combined more than one earlier patch into one, but failed to get "sage -hg qfold" to work, so i nthe patch there are liable to be more than one chunk for each file.

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A7):

It looks pretty clear to me, except perhaps where it explains the format of the options string.  Perhaps we should just include the output of "sage -mwrank -h":

```
mwrank command line options (can be in any order):

-h      help            prints this info and quits
-q      quiet           turns OFF banner display
-v n    verbosity       sets verbosity to n (default=1)
-o      PARI/GP output  turns ON extra PARI/GP short output (default is OFF)
-p n    precision       sets precision to n decimals (default=15)
                        (irrelevant unless compiled with multiprecision option)
-b n    quartic bound   bound on quartic point search (default=10)
-x n    n aux           number of aux primes used for sieving (default=6)
-l      list            turns ON listing of points (default ON unless v=0)
-t      trace           turns ON trace of quartic equivalence testing (debugging only)
-s      selmer_only     if set, computes Selmer rank only (default: not set)
-d      skip_2nd_descent        if set, skips the second descent for curves with 2-torsion (default: not set)
-S n    sat_bd          upper bound on saturation primes (default=100, -1 for automatic)
```
