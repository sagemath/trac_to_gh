Hi,

the files

* ell_modular_symbols.py
* ell_tate_curve.py
* padic_lseries.py
* sha_tate.py

are not only enhanced in a vital way but also considerably cleaned up docstring- and comment-wise by #4667. The patch there is currently based against 3.3 and needs a rebase concerning two files (ell_rational_field.py, padocs.py) against 3.4 series, and there is still one doctest failure, but nevertheless I do consider #4667 worth of applying before working on this very ticket here!

I have attached a patch trac_4933-1.patch which does this for three files:
* ell_number_field.py
* ell_torsion.py
* ell_point.py
which is a start.

The patch rewrites all the docstrings in those files and also adds them to the list of files which are processed by "sage -docbuild reference" so that they show up in the reference manual.

To review/test the patch (which was based on 3.4.1.rc2), you need to apply it and rebuild, and then (1) do  "sage -t" is usual on the files affected, and (2) do "sage -docbuild reference pdf/html/whatever" to check that the documentation looks good.

The patch trac_4933-3.patch converts the following to rest/sphinx and adds them to the reference manual:
* ell_number_field
* ell_local_data
* ell_torsion
* ell_point
* period_lattice
* weierstrass_morphism
as well as fixing some glitches in other files (notable ell_rational_field) and adding a few doctests.

Almost all the changes are in docstrings.  To review this you'll have to build the docs (reference manual) and eyeball the output.

NB I combined more than one earlier patch into one, but failed to get "sage -hg qfold" to work, so i nthe patch there are liable to be more than one chunk for each file.

It looks pretty clear to me, except perhaps where it explains the format of the options string.  Perhaps we should just include the output of "sage -mwrank -h":

```
mwrank command line options (can be in any order):

-h      help            prints this info and quits
-q      quiet           turns OFF banner display
-v n    verbosity       sets verbosity to n (default=1)
-o      PARI/GP output  turns ON extra PARI/GP short output (default is OFF)
-p n    precision       sets precision to n decimals (default=15)
                        (irrelevant unless compiled with multiprecision option)
-b n    quartic bound   bound on quartic point search (default=10)
-x n    n aux           number of aux primes used for sieving (default=6)
-l      list            turns ON listing of points (default ON unless v=0)
-t      trace           turns ON trace of quartic equivalence testing (debugging only)
-s      selmer_only     if set, computes Selmer rank only (default: not set)
-d      skip_2nd_descent        if set, skips the second descent for curves with 2-torsion (default: not set)
-S n    sat_bd          upper bound on saturation primes (default=100, -1 for automatic)
```

The new patch (trac_4933-3-rebase.patch) replaces the earlier one as it applies cleanly to 3.4.1.rc3 + ref-warnings.patch from #5808.  It also answers John Palmieri's request to make the docstring for mwrank() less confusing.

I think the reason that this one is smaller is that the previous one applied several patches in succession to the same files, while this one does not.  At least, I hope that is the reason.
