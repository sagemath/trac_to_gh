Hi,

I had some notebook sheets with parenthesis in the title with Sage v3.1.1
But since I upgraded to 3.2.1 the parenthesis are escaped, even multiple times, every time the sheet is opened again.
To reproduce the problem:
Create new sheet "Untitled"
Rename it as "Untitled (test)"
Close it, it appears properly in the list
Open it again -> "Untitled &amp;#40;test&amp;#41;"
So the bug was introduced somewhere between 3.1.1 and 3.2.1
```
