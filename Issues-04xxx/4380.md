At http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/b997f95c1e2503e0/5db5f9e7d4c8faf2 was discussion about a memory leak. I found a reasonably short bit of code that triggers the leak.

In `test.pyx`:

```
from sage.all import copy

def Test(I):
    R=I.ring()
    p=R.random_element()
    J0=list(I.reduced_basis())
    while(1):
        J = copy(J0)
        for i in range(100):
            q=p.reduce(J)
            J.append(q)
```

Apparently the memory consumption should not grow, since `J` returns to its original state after finishing the `for` loop. However, the following `Sage` session is leaking (i.e., the memory consumption grows rapidly, and after a few seconds 1GB are filled up):

```
sage: attach test.pyx
Compiling /home/king/Projekte/f5/test.pyx...
sage: from sage.rings.ideal import Cyclic
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x',5)
sage: I=Cyclic(R).homogenize()
sage: Test(I)
```

The `while` loop comprises
1. copying of a Sequence (`J0`) of `MPolynomial_libsingular`
2. reduction of `MPolynomial_libsingular`
3. appending to a Sequence.

In one of these three steps must be the leak. I suspect it is the reduction and will try to verify it.

The patch `libsingularLeak.patch` partially solves the problem.

I observed that when a coercion error occurs an intermediately generated ideal `_I` is explicitly destroyed with `id_Delete(&_I,r)`. But when there is no error and the result is returned, then `_I` is not deleted. But I think it should.

With the patch, the above `Test(I)` still shows an increase of memory, but a rather moderate increase. So, it seems to be a partial solution of the problem, but more needs to be done.

Unfortunately it doesn't fix the segfault (see #3758), but the amount of memory allocated goes down significantly already.
