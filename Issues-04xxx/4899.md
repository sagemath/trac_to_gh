/home/john/sage-3.2.2.rc1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.so in sage.rings.finite_field_ntl_gf2e.FiniteField_ntl_gf2eElement.sqrt (sage/rings/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.cpp:7072)()

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.finite_field_ntl_gf2e.FiniteField_ntl_g' object has no attribute '_one_element'
```
The point is that `GF(2^16)` (and higher) are of type  'sage.rings.finite_field_ntl_gf2e.FiniteField_ntl_gf2e'
and the code (lines 826,827 in finite_field_ntl_gf2e.pyx)

```
        if self.is_one():
            return self._one_element
```
fails.  It should be self.parent()._one_element  (though I don't know why "return self" would not be ok too).

Patch up very soon.

Nice find.   You remark "It should be self.parent()._one_element (though I don't know why "return self" would not be ok too).".  In fact, I think returning self would be ok.  I tried that and it is also over twice as fast.  So I've posted a followup patch that does that instead.
