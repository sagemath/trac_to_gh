Hi David,

it should be one issue per ticket, so I edited this ticket to be limited to the clisp issue. 

The problem with R should be another ticket and fixed:

```
sage-3.1.2/local/lib/R/library/tcltk/libs/tcltk.so links to non-whitelisted file /sw/lib/libtcl8.4.dylib
sage-3.1.2/local/lib/R/library/tcltk/libs/tcltk.so links to non-whitelisted file /sw/lib/libtk8.4.dylib
```
The db extension with Python

```
sage-3.1.2/local/lib/python2.5/lib-dynload/_bsddb.so links to non-whitelisted file /sw/lib/libdb-4.4.dylib
```
is something we will likely not fix since it should not cause any trouble.

You alsp don't need to add your email address to the CC field since that should happen automatically for any ticket you are involved with. If not check "settings" in the upper right corner. 

Cheers,

Michael

Michael:

Got the CC thing, thanks.

I didn't think we cared about clisp?  Anyway, it's up to you.

I will add another ticket for R.

Similar problem with MacPorts:

```
dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO
  Expected in: /Users/dphilp/s312/sage-3.1.2/local/lib//libPng.dylib
```
oddly enough it says nothing about /opt.  The preceding line is:

```
dvipdf clisp.dvi clisp.pdf
```
and so I assume it's Ports' dvipdf that is calling the ImageIO framework.
