Unfortunately, there is often no way to doctest such functions directly, and for some re-writing them as lambda functions is impossible or reduces readability.

Is this the same as #877?

  John (who's not quite sure what "closures" are)

P.S. By the way, I think it takes a certain amount of hubris to write a program like 'sage-coverage' which itself has no doctests or documentation :)

Not sure.

Yes, this certainly registered rather strongly on my irony meter, but right now there is no coverage for the scripts in local/bin, even though most people agreed that it would be a pretty good idea. This will hopefully happen sooner or later.
