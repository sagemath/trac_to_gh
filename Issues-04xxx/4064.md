John Cremona found this:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')                     
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=30)[0].parent()
Real Field with 896 bits of precision
sage: E.period_lattice().basis(prec=100)[0].parent()
Real Field with 3136 bits of precision
```

So we ask for 30 decimal digits of precision (which should be about 100 bits), and pari (apparently) gives us 896 bits.  Or we ask for 100 decimal digits (about 333 bits), and we get 3136 bits.  This probably has nothing to do with elliptic curves, but rather with the pari interface.

In fact when I rewrote the precision-handling in period lattice functions, I intended the prec parameter to be Sage-precision (in bits) and not pari-precision (in digits).  I suggested on sage-devel that if parameters represent decimal precision their name should reflect that and be called (for example) prec10.

This does not alter the substance of this ticket, and I hope to look into it today.

Alex, please tell me what you have done a.s.a.p. since I have looking into this in some detail too...

The main point is that converting from pari to Sage using .python() has a precision parameter which is *not* the desired Sage precision, and in fact is a useless parameter since it changes the precision of the pari object, which is rather a stupid thing to do after the object has been created.  Add to that the fact that there are at least *three* different precision scales in ues (bits, digits, and words) and we can see how it is easy for the precision to suddenly go up by a factor of 32 or 64!

Phew!

The patch fixes the issues reported here and some of those brought up by John Cremona at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/128a780383c44ce0

There has been a lot of movement in this area of the code between alpha4 and rc0.  The patch is currently based on alpha4 + patches from #3377, #1115, #3954, and #4023.  (I realize that this makes it more trouble to review, but it will make it easier to apply to rc0 once that's out).

There is one doctest failure that I am aware of, in ell_number_field.py (I'll try to sort it out tomorrow if nobody beats me to it).

I successfully applied the whole sequence of patches ending with 4064-ell_pari_precision.patch to fresh 3.1.2.alpha4 builds on two machines, a 32-bit and a 64-bit.  

Testing all of sage.schemes.elliptic_curves, the only failure on 32-bit was (as Alex reported) in ell_number_field.py:

```
File "/home/jec/sage-current/tmp/ell_number_field.py", line 1133:
    sage: L.basis(prec=10)
Expected:
    (4.1310718527050167743096955262475367...,
    -2.0655359263525083871548477631237683... + 0.98863042446910777236901069433960633...*I)
Got:
    (4.13107185270501677, -2.06553592635250838 + 0.988630424469107772*I)
```

On the 64-bit I also had stuff in period_lattice.py and in ell_rational_field.py this:

```
File "/home/jec/sage-current/tmp/ell_rational_field.py", line 448:
    sage: [a.precision() for a in E]
Expected:
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Got:
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

This is just on account of differing behaviour on 64-bit machines which Alex had not tested, so I'll edit the doctests accorsingly and come back with an additional patch.

For the record, John's patch looks good to me.

In order to ease the work of whoever might want to look at this before rc0 comes out, I have attached a patch with all the prerequisites listed in the above comments.  So if you're on a 3.1.2.alpha4 and want to check this out, first apply 4064-prerequisites.patch, then the two others from this ticket.  You of course don't have to review any of the changes in 4064-prerequisites.patch, since these have all already been reviewed and merged.

If you're on rc0 just apply the two first patches.

.. and I am more than happy with Alex's.  It has been a very good collaborative effort, and knowing that two of us have got to grips with the issue is very good to know.

I'll put the next patch concerning pari precision issues onto a new ticket;  it will certainly depend on all these,
