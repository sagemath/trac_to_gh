How can this file be serious?

```
wstein@one:~/devel/sage$ more spkg-debian-maybe
#!/bin/sh -x
BUILD_ROOT=../../../
mv dist/debian $BUILD_ROOT
cd $BUILD_ROOT/..
echo "Starting Debian build"
dasource ./sage-2.10.1
sbuildhack "$DEBIAN_RELEASE" *.dsc
echo "Debian Build complete"
```

See for example the "sage-2.10.1"

This needs some careful fix, i.e. the file exists in two places:

```
./local/bin/spkg-debian-maybe
./devel/sage-main/spkg-debian-maybe
```
But it is also referred to in two places:

```
devel/sage-main/setup.py
devel/sage-main/spkg-dist
```

Cheers,

Michael

I've added two patches to fix this. Note that `spkg-debian-maybe` was **not** under version control in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin` -- it was only mentioned in `.hgignore`. (It wouldn't hurt to leave that in there, I guess, so feel free to ignore the second patch.)

Note that the main repo patch depends on #6133 -- both touch `MANIFEST.in`, so one had to depend on the other in the end ... and I wrote the other first, so that's how it ended up.

I'm sure this patch could wait for `4.0.1` -- but the "clean dead files in the build directory" script I'm just finishing for #5977 notices it, so we might as well just kill it now.
