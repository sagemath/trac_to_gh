Add the option to put legends on plots.  

Also fixes three long test markers that where reading #long rather than #long time and two or three minor documentation mistakes elsewhere in the code.  These where bundled because they don't warrant a separate ticket for me but are still nice to fix.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">comment:7</div>

The good news is that Mike Hansen's patch does apply cleanly to 3.2.2.

The bad news is that this patch breaks some basic functionality:

```
sage: p = plot(tan(x), x, -1/2, 1/2)
sage: show(p)

```
raises a TypeError exception.

That is serious but more serious (to me - maybe this exception is 
an easy-to-fix bug) is the design of this legend functionality. 

It seems to me (and people who know about the Graphics class can hopefully
correct me if I am wrong) the following is both possible and a fairly 
natural way of writing a legend as another graphics object:

1. given 2d plot objects P, Q (ie, instances of a Graphics class),
one could wrote a function which returns 
(a) the functions being plotted in P,Q (resp), 
(b) the line style used in P,Q (resp).
From this data, one can write a function taking P,Q (and a cnter point)
as arguments (more generally any list of such plot objects) and returning
a legend as an analog of a text plot. This can be placed anywhere 
by choosing the center point appropriately.

I'm happy to change my opinion (since IMHO this added functionality would be great),
especially if someone with more knowledge of the plotting can comment positively
on this. I really greatly appreciate the hard programming work that went into this.
Maybe I'm being naive but the design to me seems a bit awkward, and in any case 
it breaks show (which is bad, hence making it a "show stopper", if you excuse 
the horribly bad pun).

There is no such thing as "negative review", but there is "needs work".

The last patch (trac_4342_v3.2.patch) fixes the TypeError problem and add tests and documentation where appropriate (can't believe I missed these).

As far as I know, there is no way to get the function that's being plotted from the GraphicsPrimitve object (except maybe for some specialized primitives like Circle) because all you have is a matrix of sample points.  So I don't think it is a good way.

About the center point, it is already possible to specify a tuple of floats between 0 and 1 that gives the relative coordinates of the legend box.

And last, about the design, I kind of copied it from matplotlib where each object is labeled beforehand.  I could always provide an option to specify legend labels in show() and save() but due to the design of Graphics I think this would be shaky at best because the user has now reliable way of knowing the content of a Graphics object.

Anyway if some clever way of overcoming the obstacle(s) above is found then something like what you want could be implemented in a later patch.

```
sage: P1 = plot(exp(x), 0, 2, legend_label='$y=e^x$')
sage: P2 = plot(sin(x), 0, 2, rgbcolor=(1,0,0),legend_label='$y=\sin(x)$')
sage: show(P1+P2)

produces a beautiful plot of two curves, one red and the other blue, and the legend labels are collected into a distinctive light grey box with the correct labels.

Wonderful!!

Great.  This is what I get by developing related features separately.

Anyway I noticed that this is fixed if you apply both this patch and the one at #4898 in that order.

If that is unacceptable, then I'll split the fix out.

<div id="comment:24" align="right">comment:24</div>

I understand the current problem as follows.


**Problem:** To locate where the function `text` should be applied to the function `plot` to be able to have legends for plots.

**Example about the problem for one function when legend is at x=1**

```
   var('x');
   x_cord = 1;
   f = x**2;
   p = plot(f,x)+text(f,(x_cord,f(x_cord))
```


for one function.

**Similarly for two functions (syntax may change), for instance, when all legends are at x=1:**


```
   g = x;
   f = x**2;
   p = plot(f,x);
   x_cord = 1
   (g + f) + text(f, (f,x_cord), g, (g,x_cord))             // not sure about the syntax
```

If there are 7 functions, then it would be have nice to have a shortcut -command such as 


```
(a + b + ... + g) + legends()
```
 
to put the legends automatically to each function.

As for a shortcut, I think it would be consistent to make it an option to show, like `(a+b+...+g).show(legends=True)`.

I just looked through, and the ideas behind the patch look like they are still very good and applicable.  I guess I'm not surprised that it doesn't apply; there's been a lot of reworking of plotting code in the past year.

It looks like a straightforward project to get this patch back up to speed and include it in Sage.

Agreed.  Here is a preliminary and very naive rebase - it still needs some work because of the change to save() using matplotlib(), as well as the defaults, I think, since mpl changed their legend options somewhat.

<div id="comment:29" align="right">comment:29</div>

Here is an example from contour_plot.py for using suboption:

```
@suboptions('label', fontsize=9, colors='blue', inline=None, inline_spacing=3, fmt="%1.2f")
```

So I think you need to specify the options that you are passing in, and their default values, in the `@`suboption decorator, rather than as a dictionary in your plotting function.  This will make the following keyword arguments available:

label_fontsize, label_colors, label_inline, label_inline_spacing, label_fmt

Inside the function, though, you will see all of these keyword arguments as a single dictionary called label, and you'll access the options as label['fontsize'], label['colors'], label['inline'], etc.

Does that explanation help?

Ready for review.  I made legend -> show_legend and that seems to clear up the problems with the `@`suboptions dictionary.  I expect it to be "needs work", by the way, but I want extensive testing of this.  Things to watch out for include:

* Whether there are any missing/needed plot3d method removals

* What the defaults should really be for all the legend_options; I don't think they are that good.

* Whether there are any other places where a KeyError might arise.

Incidentally, the rebase wasn't quite as bad as it seemed - the earlier patch for some reason was a "double patch" that sometimes occurs, as will be obvious if read the above (which I didn't).
