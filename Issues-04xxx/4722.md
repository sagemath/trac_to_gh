I'm in a talk right now, and the speaker (Marco from Holland) just pointed out that
Sage's K.hilbert_class_polynomial() function, for K quadratic imaginary, is a *LIE*.
It returns a poly that defines that Hilbert class field, but it is *not* the Hilbert Class Polynomial.

Observe:

```
sage: K.<a> =QuadraticField(-97)
sage: K.hilbert_class_polynomial()
x^4 + 9*x^2 - 6*x + 1
sage: magma(K.discriminant()).HilbertClassPolynomial()
$.1^4 - 750062398364686994581728000*$.1^3 - 20542159225989612130996373047535232000000*$.1^2 + 208224136957169320201407896480139264000000000*$.1 - 1121692648948590091501551223636881408000000000000
```

Solution: change the name of this function and add documentation clarifying this, say including the above example.

The difference is *very* important, given the use of the Hilbert class polynomial in computing elliptic curves with a given number of rational points.

Not me. This is a wrapper for the Pari/gp function quadhilbert.  

I find this unanswered question about what it returns:

http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-0402/msg00000.html

Certainly it does not return the hilbert class polynomial (minimal 
polynomial of the j-invariant), rather it returns a "nicer" polynomial 
over QQ which generates the Hilbert class field over K.

I agree that a name change is in order to avoid this confusion, but 
I don't have a suggestion other than 

hilbert_class_field_[relative_]defining_polynomial

which is a bit long, but descriptive.  Note that the hilbert_class_field 
does not have this as a defining polynomial (hence the relative_), 
since it is formed as a compositum of the quadratic and degree h 
extensions rather than a relative extension.

The documentation should also be corrected to say that Schertz's method 
is used (only) for D < 0.  A reference to Schertz's methods and whatever 
method (Stark units?) is used for D > 0 would be desirable.
