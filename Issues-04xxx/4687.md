I guess the category number theory might be more appropriate. Also CCing John just in case he might be interested in this ticket and not aware of its existence.

Thanks for the bug report:  the code did not handle the case of a trivial group properly!  Your curve is essentially the only example of that (and did appear in a doctest elsewhere).

The attached patch fixes this, adding doctests to show that all three cases (#gens=0,1,2) can be handled.  It is based on 3.2.1.
