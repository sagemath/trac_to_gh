I fixed a few problems in the spkg, so now it fails after only 30 minutes as follows:

```

sage: An error occurred while installing polymake-2.2.p5
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /usr/local/sage/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to
/usr/local/sage/spkg/build/polymake-2.2.p5 and type 'make'.
Instead type "/usr/local/sage/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/usr/local/sage/spkg/build/polymake-2.2.p5
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)
```

The new spkg is here and should replace the original one. Also, I think this should be moved to experimental, in which case we could close this ticket:

I get the same with mpi4py:
