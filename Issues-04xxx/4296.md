sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2), x)
sage: f = R(x^9 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x)
sage: h = R(x^10 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1)
sage: (f^2) % h
x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3
sage: pow(f, 2, h)
x^18 + x^14 + x^12 + x^10 + x^8 + x^4 + x^2
```
We should expect both results to be equal to f<sup>2</sup> mod h.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Ah, good point. 

I'm not sure how I feel about throwing the symbolic x around all around, though I guess efficiency doesn't matter too much here. 

Also, just looking at the code it can be very inefficient--it computes (a^b) in full, then divides by the modulus taking the remainder. This is fine for small exponents, but for anything large is wasteful.

Yeah, I would consider it a good idea to get this in as is and open another ticket to make this more efficient.

I sympathise with robertwb's concern, but that should be a separate ticket.  I looked for, but could not find anywhere, the code which pow(f,2,h) runs.
