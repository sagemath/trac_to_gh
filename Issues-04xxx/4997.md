When doctesting a 64 bit OSX build of Sage we have these failures for every doctest:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/complex_interval_field.py"  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/michaelabshoff/Desktop/sage-3.2.3-64bit/tmp/complex_interval_field.py", line 2, in <module>

    from sage.rings.memory import pmem_malloc

```
The fix is to link the first library to be imported against libcsage:

This fix is also needed on Cygwin.

A proper patch is coming up.

This is not needed, I am not sure what happened. Either way: invalid.
