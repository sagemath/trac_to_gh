Is this the right place for suggestions for the function "solve" ?

1) The docstring has a typo : "... solve an equation of system ..."
Should be an "or" here.

2) The section
" solution_dict = True -- return a list of dictionaries containing the
solutions. "
made me think that solution_dict defaults to True which is not the case.
Maybe this could be made more clear.

3) 'solution_dict = True' fails when only a single univariate equation
is given. The solution is then not a list of lists and the conversion to
dictionary fails:

sage: var('a')
a
sage: solve ([a^2-1],a,solution_dict=True)

Thanks for your great work.

Hi Karl-Dieter,

I uploaded a new version of your patch at [attachment: trac_4786-solution_dict.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4786/trac_4786-solution_dict.take2.patch.gz)The changes are:
* used `sorted( d.items() )` to print a dictionary in a doctest
* changed the block:

 ```
            try:
                sol_dict=[dict([[eq.left(),eq.right()] for eq in solution]) for solution in sol_list]
            except TypeError:
                if not isinstance(sol_list[0],list):
                    sol_list = [[i] for i in sol_list]
                    sol_dict=[dict([[eq.left(),eq.right()] for eq in solution]) for solution in sol_list]
 ```
 to

 ```
            if isinstance(sol_list[0], list):
                sol_dict=[dict([[eq.left(),eq.right()] for eq in solution])
                        for solution in sol_list]
            else:
                sol_dict=[{eq.left():eq.right()} for eq in sol_list]
 ```

Please give this ticket a positive review if you're ok with my changes.

That change sounds fine - I am used to catching Errors, but in this case isinstance makes much more sense.

Ironically, though:

File "/Users/.../sage-4.1.1/devel/sage-morepatchtests/sage/symbolic/relation.py", line 455:
    sage: map(lambda x: sorted(x.items()), res)
Expected:
    [[(y, 4), (x, 2)], [(y, 4), (x, -2)]]
Got:
    [[(x, 2), (y, 4)], [(x, -2), (y, 4)]]

```
So I fixed that in the latest version, and hopefully now you can give it positive review!

Somehow, `y` is shown first on my laptop, better to just print the values for each variable as Mike has done just a few lines above. 

I attached a new patch only with this doctest changed. Hopefully this is the last one. :)
