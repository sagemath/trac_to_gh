Observe:

```
sage: a = magma('10000')
sage: a.name()
'_sage_[1]'
sage: del a
sage: magma.eval('_sage_[1]')
'10000'
```

Whenever anybody ever creates a MagmaElement via the Magma interface, it doesn't get deleted.  This is because possible (1) the clear method in magma.py is commented out, and/or (2) the _available_var list that gets appended to in (1) isn't actually used by magma.py, so e.g., _sage_[1] in the example above never gets re-used.

Here's a vivid illustration of the memory leakage, which of course we know is there by reading the code:

```
sage: a = [magma('3^100000') for _ in range(1000)]
sage: magma.GetMemoryUsage()
42917912
sage: del a
sage: magma.GetMemoryUsage()
42917912
sage: a = [magma('3^100000') for _ in range(1000)]
sage: magma.GetMemoryUsage()
69103640
sage: del a
sage: magma.GetMemoryUsage()
69103640

Patch looks good to me. There is a spelling error in the new docstring: "clearlying" _ i will fix it in the patch I will apply.
