# Issue 4241: [with patch; positive review] magma -- memory is never freed in the interface when MagmaElement's are deleted

Observe:

```
sage: a = magma('10000')
sage: a.name()
'_sage_[1]'
sage: del a
sage: magma.eval('_sage_[1]')
'10000'
```

Whenever anybody ever creates a MagmaElement via the Magma interface, it doesn't get deleted.  This is because possible (1) the clear method in magma.py is commented out, and/or (2) the _available_var list that gets appended to in (1) isn't actually used by magma.py, so e.g., _sage_[1] in the example above never gets re-used.
