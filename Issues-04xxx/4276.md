To help possible reviewers of what looks like very useful and good stuff, would it be possible to write a few words about what is going on here?

By the way, the second patch does not view properly whan I click on it.  I don't know why.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Yes, I explained this to some people at Sage Days 10, but it certainly could use some explanation here. 

These patches move coercion over to the new api, which is (hopefully) easier to understand and use as well as being faster. As part of this move, we also get the benefit of being able to specify embeddings at creation time, into RR or CC being the most common. (The embeddings into RR and CC are by default into "lazy" fields so the path can be followed to a field of any precision.) Cyclotomic fields and fields created with the "QuadraticField" command come with their standard embeddings. 

A field with an embedding can do arithmetic with its ambient field, and if two number fields have an embedding into a common field than elements can be moved from one to the other as well. Here is a brief example (though more can be found in the documentation): 

```
sage: L.<a> = QuadraticField(-3)
sage: a + 1.5
1.50000000000000 + 1.73205080756888*I
sage: a + 1.50000000000000000000000000000000000000
1.50000000000000000000000000000000000000 + 1.73205080756887729352744634150587236694*I
sage: K.<zeta> = CyclotomicField(12)
sage: K(a)
2*zeta^7 + 1

sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^5-x+1, embedding=-1.1)
sage: b in RR
True
sage: RR(b)
-1.16730397826142
sage: RealField(200)(b)
-1.1673039782614186842560458998548421807205603715254890391401
sage: RealField(200)(b^2-5)
-3.6374014223350653758204435726195439793325331732024834332371
sage: RealField(200)(b^5-b+1)

```

This also paves the path for more sophisticated arithmetic, like automatic compositums.

Anyway, they apply and build fine (eventually) under 3.1.4. Testing number_field/ passes except for a minor numerical noise issue:

But I can't really do much to test the new functionality, since I'm not sure what it's supposed to do.

Note that Sage does not guarantee associativity of addition. Consider

```
sage: ZZ['t,x'].0 + ZZ['x'].0 + ZZ['t'].0
2*t + x

This is because there is an ambiguous ordering of the variables if the rightmost addition is performed first. What should be true, however, is if both operations succeed then they should give equal answers.

<a id='comment:10'></a>I am trying to referee this, but it's going to take some time.  I'm going to put it into my tree and try to move some of my code that does this by hand to the embedding architecture.  Email me in a month.

I have some questions and problems:

I really need to be able to specify embeddings after creation, because *tons* of functions create number fields (composite_fields, for example, or subfields) and I really don't want to specify all possible embeddings of the results...

First, why squarefree_part bounded?  This could be a separate patch.

Second, I can specify non-embeddings that seem to be ignored:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3+2, embedding=CC(-10).nth_root(3))
sage: K.coerce_embedding()

Generic morphism:
  From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^3 + 2
  To:   Complex Lazy Field
  Defn: a -> 0.6299605249474365? + 1.091123635971722?*I
sage: K.gen_embedding()^3
-2.00000000000000? + 0.?e-14*I
```

Finally, I am having lots of trouble creating non-default embeddings:

```
sage: K2.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2, 'a', embedding=RR(-sqrt(2)))

Yes, in retrospect it could be. I moved that code out of the number field file, and while doing so decided to optimize it. 

> Second, I can specify non-embeddings that seem to be ignored:


I'm not sure what you're trying to show with your example. It picks the closest root (so one doesn't need to specify the root to an arbitrary precision). 

> Finally, I am having lots of trouble creating non-default embeddings:


`sage: K2.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 2, 'a', embedding=RR(-sqrt(2)))`

I agree these tracebacks are bad, but it's having trouble deciding which of I*sqrt(2) or -I*sqrt(2) is closest to sqrt(2). I'll have it throw a more sensible error instead.

<a id='comment:18'></a>This code is good, it really is, but it's just not tested.  I don't have time right now to test it and I will be sans computer over the Christmas break.

I have to give this a negative review because I do not believe the embeddings work in anything more than the trivial situation: two absolute fields, compatible embeddings into CC.

On the other hand, I have no reservations about the coercion part of this patch.  Are we willing to accept almost certainly broken new functionality to have valuable infrastructure upgrades?

```
sage: L1 = NumberField(x^4 + 6*x^2 + 1, 'a', embedding=CC(5*I))
sage: NumberField(x^4 + 6*x^2 + 1, 'a', embedding=L1.gen())

Ok.
 
> On the other hand, I have no reservations about the coercion part of this patch.  Are we willing to accept almost certainly broken new functionality to have valuable infrastructure upgrades?


I would say the answer is to merge this as is and then open follow up tickets for the problems. Does #4692 address your current concern?

It looks like 3.2.2 will be longer than I have though, so getting this in now should give us the time needed to straighten this out before release.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

I don't embeddings are "almost certainly broken", but keep trying to break it. Not doing everything one can hope for is acceptable to me, as long as it fails gracefully. And it doesn't break currently working code. 

And thanks again for taking the time to look at this and try it out, it's a huge patch.

<a id='comment:25'></a>Comment by Nick Alexander, but it ended up in the wrong box, so I am appending it here:

I'm not sure what is supposed to happen, but this probably isn't it.  AFAICT, these embeddings are *not* compatible.  Or they are only after some work, that makes the results at the end strange.

Please explain why this is correct if it is!

Hi,

I would greatly prefer that now with fixes3 merged on top of the previous patches we could get this ticket (positively) reviewed and address any followup issues or Nick's improvements on a new ticket. That way the credit situation is much cleaner and this ticket isn't left to hang open.

Cheers,
