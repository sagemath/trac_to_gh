Jon Hanke wrote some substantial amount of code that is still based on Sage 2.8.14. Get the code ready for review and merge it 

#4120 is relevant here since Justin works on binary quadratic forms.

Justin,

a preliminary diff can be found at
 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/john-hanke-qf.diff

There still are renames to be done, but I should have something in the next 24 hours. Feel free to start the review despite the comment in the summary.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Gonzalo, Jon,

this patch needs a formal review, so either one of you can give a positive review to the other person's work. We will give an exception to the coverage requirements in this case, but I will open a followup ticket to get coverage up to 100%.

Jon Hanke and I have been working on reviewing the initial patch last week, improving and doctesting the code. Although the coverage is not 100%, and there's most certainly still bugs in the code, it is completely orthogonal to the rest of sage so it won't affect anything else. Given SD13 and AWS soon, we expect to improve it in the next couple of weeks.

I strongly recommend inclusion of this patch into sage.
