Jon Hanke wrote some substantial amount of code that is still based on Sage 2.8.14. Get the code ready for review and merge it 

#4120 is relevant here since Justin works on binary quadratic forms.

Jon Hanke and I have been working on reviewing the initial patch last week, improving and doctesting the code. Although the coverage is not 100%, and there's most certainly still bugs in the code, it is completely orthogonal to the rest of sage so it won't affect anything else.

I strongly recommend inclusion of this patch into sage.
