Jon Hanke wrote some substantial amount of code that is still based on Sage 2.8.14. Get the code ready for review and merge it 

#4120 is relevant here since Justin works on binary quadratic forms.

Jon Hanke and I have been working on reviewing the initial patch last week, improving and doctesting the code. Although the coverage is not 100%, and there's most certainly still bugs in the code, it is completely orthogonal to the rest of sage so it won't affect anything else. Given SD13 and AWS soon, we expect to improve it in the next couple of weeks.

I strongly recommend inclusion of this patch into sage.
