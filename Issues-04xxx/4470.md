Hi Gonzalo, Jon,

this patch needs a formal review, so either one of you can give a positive review to the other person's work. We will give an exception to the coverage requirements in this case, but I will open a followup ticket to get coverage up to 100%.

Cheers,

Michael

Jon Hanke and I have been working on reviewing the initial patch last week, improving and doctesting the code. Although the coverage is not 100%, and there's most certainly still bugs in the code, it is completely orthogonal to the rest of sage so it won't affect anything else. Given SD13 and AWS soon, we expect to improve it in the next couple of weeks.

I strongly recommend inclusion of this patch into sage.
