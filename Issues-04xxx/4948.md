Jason comments:

```
These are not the right way to do this, but they seem to give results 
for right now, at least until someone fixes this:

sage: a=mathematica([1,2,3])
sage: [a[i] for i in range(1,a.Length()+1)]
[1, 2, 3]

Or

sage: a=mathematica(slist)
sage: a._Expect__sage_list
[1, 2, 3]
```

Cheers,

Michael
