Jason comments:

```
These are not the right way to do this, but they seem to give results 
for right now, at least until someone fixes this:

sage: a=mathematica([1,2,3])
sage: [a[i] for i in range(1,a.Length()+1)]
[1, 2, 3]

Or

sage: a=mathematica(slist)
sage: a._Expect__sage_list
[1, 2, 3]
```

Cheers,

Michael

I added the requested doctest for the generic _exponent_symbol(), a method that is meant to be overloaded by each derived class (i.e. the interface to gp, mathematica, etc).  Since this is meant to be overloaded by each of the interfaces, I didn't use any existing interface in this doctest, as when _exponent_symbol() was overloaded by that interface the doctest would become misleading.  Instead I created a fake interface so that the doctest would always call the correct version of _exponent_symbol.  It's a bit messy but it's the most stable way of doctesting the function that I could think of.

The approach could be taken to write doctests for the rest of the methods in the Expect class.
