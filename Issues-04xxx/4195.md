This now works without having surf installed:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)
sage: I = R.ideal([y^3 - x^2])
sage: I.plot()
sage: I = R.ideal([y^2 - x^2 - 1])
```

**Attachment:** [mpolynomial_ideal_plot.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4195/mpolynomial_ideal_plot.patch.gz)

I'm CCing wdj as he wrote the original plotting code.
