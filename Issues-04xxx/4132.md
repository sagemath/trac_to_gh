Clarification: By "every simple operation" robertwb does not mean "arithmetic operations", which don't use PARI at all.  He means special functions like, exp, sin, Riemann zeta, etc. 

Robert, what do you propose to use instead of pari for these?  In some cases you can implement things building on what is in mpfr...

Yes, thanks for the clarification. I meant for many of them one could implement them directly against mpfr. For example:

```

include "sage/rings/mpfr.pxi"
from sage.rings.complex_number cimport ComplexNumber

def my_exp(ComplexNumber self):
    cdef ComplexNumber z = self._new()
    cdef mpfr_t r
    mpfr_init2(r, self._prec)
    mpfr_exp(r, self.__re, GMP_RNDN)
    mpfr_cos(z.__re, self.__im, GMP_RNDN)
    mpfr_mul(z.__re, z.__re, r, GMP_RNDN)
    mpfr_sin(z.__im, self.__im, GMP_RNDN)
    mpfr_mul(z.__im, z.__im, r, GMP_RNDN)
    mpfr_clear(r)
    return z
```

Then

```
sage: a = CC.pi() + CC.0/3
sage: my_exp(a) == a.exp()
True
sage: timeit("a.exp()")
625 loops, best of 3: 514 µs per loop
sage: timeit("my_exp(a)")
625 loops, best of 3: 16.1 µs per loop
sage: 514/16.1
31.9254658385093
```

This could be low-hanging fruit for a new developer.

The attached patch does the following:

* based on Robert's example, gets rid of Pari calls in cos, cosh, sin, sinh, tan, tanh, exp, sqrt, nth_root, !__pow!__
* adds csc() and sec()
* adds a !__nonzero!__() method to speed up is_zero()
* fixes doctests that were affected by these changes

The patch is currently based on 3.1.3.alpha1, and I'm putting it out as such so that it can be reviewed.  I am aware of some interaction with patches that were merged in alpha2, so I will rebase it once alpha2 is out.

I have replaced the old patch with one that addresses the first two points made above.  I had actually done benchmarks while writing the code, and they're now listed further down in this comment.

As for the point on accuracy: I guess the issue is elliptic_logarithm, which was somewhat broken before this patch and is still broken now (see #4214); this has nothing to do with this ticket, though.

Nice work. You've probably noticed by now that the trig operations are expensive, so you could possibly shave 25% of some of the calls where you compute both sinh and cosh by using the identity

    cosh(x) = sqrt(1+sinh(x)).

On the note of expensive trig, might I suggest a faster sqrt 

```
def new_sqrt(ComplexNumber self, all=False):
    cdef ComplexNumber z = self._new()
    if mpfr_zero_p(self.__im):
        if mpfr_sgn(self.__re) >= 0:
            mpfr_set_ui(z.__im, 0, rnd)
            mpfr_sqrt(z.__re, self.__re, rnd)
        else:
            mpfr_set_ui(z.__re, 0, rnd)
            mpfr_neg(z.__im, self.__re, rnd)
            mpfr_sqrt(z.__im, z.__im, rnd)
        if all:
            return [z, -z] if z else [z]
        else:
            return z
    # z = x + yi = (a+bi)^2
    # expand, substitute, solve (note that a is nonzero)
    # a^2 = (x + sqrt(x^2+y^2))/2
    cdef mpfr_t a2
    mpfr_init2(a2, self._prec)
    mpfr_hypot(a2, self.__re, self.__im, rnd)
    mpfr_add(a2, a2, self.__re, rnd)
    mpfr_mul_2si(a2, a2, -1, rnd)
    # a = sqrt(a2)
    mpfr_sqrt(z.__re, a2, rnd)
    # b = y/(2a)
    mpfr_div(z.__im, self.__im, z.__re, rnd)
    mpfr_mul_2si(z.__im, z.__im, -1, rnd)
    mpfr_clear(a2)
    if all:
        return [z, -z]
    else:
        return z
```

which should run in 3 or 4 µs with 53 bits, and an even more significant improvement further out. 

This patch is very good, exactly what I wanted when I wrote the ticket, so thanks. The only thing that *needs* to change for a positive review is I noticed in several case you write `long(n)` when you want an unsigned long. What this does is create a python int, call the python type "long" on it to get a python long, then extract that as a c long.
