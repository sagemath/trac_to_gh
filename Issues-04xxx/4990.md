The attached Sage code has been written by

* Eduardo Ocampo Alvarez
* Andrey Timofeev

from the University of Essen in Germany. It needs some integration, but other than that it should be ready to be merged.

Cheers,

Attachment: **[trac_4990.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4990/trac_4990.patch.gz)**

The attached patch adds the method `hilbert_class_polynomial()` to `NumberField_quadratic` and cleans the code up a little bit.

I cannot perform comparative timings since I don't have access to Magma at the moment.  Doing `%prun` with large discriminants indicates that the large majority of the time is spent in the Pari library computing the j-invariants of the representative tau's.  So I don't think rewriting the method in Cython will have a significant effect.

Looks good to me.  I tested it with the following script, and found a lot of curves with the correct endomorphism rings :)

```
K.<a> = QuadraticField(-34)
f = K.hilbert_class_polynomial()
assert K.class_number() == f.degree()

for P in K.primes_of_degree_one_list(20):
    p = P.norm()
    k = GF(p)
    rts = f.roots(k, multiplicities=False)
    for jj in rts:
        assert P.is_principal()
        E = EllipticCurve(jj)
        print E
        assert E.frobenius_order().number_field().is_isomorphic(K)
    if not rts:
        print "XXX", p
        assert not P.is_principal()

Ticket #4990 implemented a hilbert_class_polynomial() method for
imaginary quadratic fields.  It is actually a function of the field's
discriminant, i.e. of a fundamental (negative) discriminant.  It was
written by      Eduardo Ocampo Alvarez and  Andrey Timofeev  from
Essen and is in sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py.

We also have a function in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py called
hilbert_class_polynomial(D), which uses Magma to find more general
H.C.polys (D is any negative integer congruent to 0,1 mod 4).

For fundamental discriminants D, these give the same answer, i.e.
QuadraticField(D,'a').hilbert_class_polynomial() ==
hilbert_class_polynomial(D).

Question 1: does the code at #4990 (now merged actually work for
non-fundamental discriminants?  Someone might know;  testing it would
need a bit of coding, and I haven't done so.

Assuming that the answer is "yes",

Question 2: should we re-write the stand-alone function which takes as
its argument any negative discriminant (not necessarily fundamental)
and returns the appropriate H.C.poly, using the code now in
number_field.py instead of calling Magma;  and then change the current
method in number_field.py to just call that?  If so, where should the
stand-alone function go:  (a) where it now is, in
sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py, (b) in
sage/rings/number_field/somewhere, (c) somewhere else ?  We could then
also make the H.C.poly a function of (possibly non-maximal) orders in
(imaginary quadratic) number fields.

PS I found this out while converting cm.py to ReST for inclusion in
the manual.  Isn't it amazing what you find!
