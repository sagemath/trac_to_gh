So currently, we compare elements of inexact rings like `CDF` by just comparing their components as `double`s. We use this for sorting, and expect the results to be consistent between runs, architectures, etc. However, this is wildly untrue. Here's a good example:

```
sage: z1, z2 = [ x[0] for x in f.roots()[-2:] ]
sage: R = CDF['x']
sage: f = R([17,1,0,0,0,1]) ; f
1.0*x^5 + 1.0*x + 17.0
sage: f.roots()
[(-1.72502775061, 1),
 (1.4372759883 + 1.06991737978*I, 1),
 (1.4372759883 - 1.06991737978*I, 1),
 (-0.574762112991 + 1.65506825348*I, 1),
 (-0.574762112991 - 1.65506825348*I, 1)]
sage: z1, z2 = [ x[0] for x in f.roots()[-2:] ]
sage: z1
-0.574762112991 + 1.65506825348*I
sage: z2
-0.574762112991 - 1.65506825348*I
sage: z1.real() == z2.real()
False
```

Notice that the `+`/`-` ordering is different for the two pairs of complex conjugate roots. What we **should** do is pass a parameter to `__cmp__` that describes a threshold such that if the difference is smaller than this threshold in absolute value, things compare equal. This could even be a parameter to the ring.

There are a ton of questions this brings up, such as, "how is this done in other systems?" Notice this also underlies the following confusing result:

```
sage: [ f(x[0]).is_zero() for x in f.roots() ]
[False, False, False, False, False]
```

Someone should do some research and start a sage-devel conversation, probably.

I'm totally unwilling to add some sort of epsilon for complex comparison in general; it's just a bad idea.

However, the goal of sorting the output of .roots() is not so bad, and I'm willing to put an epsilon comparison in that sorting routine (since it's basically only for display, and especially since it helps doctest consistency); so that's what I've done in the attached patch.

[11:50am] cwitty: Reading the patch, it looks entirely reasonable.
[11:51am] cwitty: As release manager, will you accept that sort of review?
[12:01pm] mabs: cwitty: yes

```
So we are good to go. Note that one of the issues Craig raises is

```
sage: [ f(x[0]).is_zero() for x in f.roots() ]
[False, False, False, False, False]
```
which is not resolved by this ticket.

Craig: If you think this is worth a follow up ticket please open such a ticket.
