Herewith and there ([http://www.loria.fr/~thevenyp/complex_mpc.patch](http://www.loria.fr/~thevenyp/complex_mpc.patch) 38K) is a patch with new classes using the MPC library for complex multi-precision arithmetic (see ticket #4308 for the associated spackage).

This is an adaptation of the module real_mpfr and of ComplexField and [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) classes. It adds a class MPComplexField with precision (common to both part) and rounding modes (specific to each part) and a class MPComplexNumber.

This first attempt implements only the complex arithmetic.

The test suite does fail due to coercion problems I can't solve.

Philippe,

Great work!  I'll do my best to review this for 3.2.2.  Right now I notice that the patch doesn't work in 3.2.1 because of #4580.  I'm attaching a tiny patch that fixes that (should be applied after complex_mpc.p0.patch.

<a id='comment:5'></a>There are a few small issues that I ran into, but since this is going to be (for now) an optional part of Sage and nothing depends on it, I think we can fix these later (I'm keeping a list of them so they don't get lost).

However, there is a policy of 100% doctest for all new code.  The coverage is now:

```
[ghitza@artin sage]$ sage -coverage rings/complex_mpc.pyx
----------------------------------------------------------------------
rings/complex_mpc.pyx
SCORE rings/complex_mpc.pyx: 68% (46 of 67)

Missing documentation:
	 * _repr_ (self):
	 * _latex_(self):
	 * _an_element_(self):
	 * random_element(self, bound):
	 * __hash__(self):
	 * prec(self):
	 * _set(self, z, y=None, base=10):

Missing doctests:

	 * _rnd_re(self):
	 * _rnd_im(self):
	 * _real_field(self):
	 * _imag_field(self):


Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _element_constructor_(self, z):
	 * _coerce_map_from_(self, S):
	 * bint is_exact(self) except -2: return False def is_finite(self):
	 * Element _call_(self, z):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

So the missing docstrings and doctests will have to be added before this patch can be merged.  I would happily do this but the earliest I can get to it is Thursday or so (and that's being optimistic).

To end on a positive note: this looks good.  It will take a bit more work, but if we can show that (a) the performance is improved, or doesn't suffer too much, and (b) the switch can be made seamlessly, then it will be easy to convince people that we should switch the core of our complex numbers functionality over to MPC.

I added a patch trac4446_doctests.patch, which does a number of things:

* adds doctests for all functions except three internal use only functions
* changes _repr_ of complex numbers so that it agrees with the way complex numbers are currently printed in Sage
* makes MPComplexField inherit from ParentWithGens, being generated over its real field by the square root of -1 (just as it is now); this required adding a few functions.  So now one can do

```
sage: from sage.rings.complex_mpc import MPComplexField
sage: MPC.<j> = MPComplexField()
sage: j^2
-1.00000000000000 + 0.000000000000000*I
```

Note that only the last three patches should be applied, in order: complex_mpc.p0.patch, trac4446_fix.patch, and trac4446_doctests.patch

<a id='comment:9'></a>REFEREE REPORT:

1. How can this be optional? If the patch is applied then this is included:

```
 	625	    Extension('sage.rings.complex_mpc', 
 	626	              sources = ['sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx'], 
 	627	              libraries = ['mpc', 'mpfr', 'gmp']), \ 
 	628	
```
So the only way I can see this going in like this is if it is standard.  Am I missing something (probably)?

2. Timings on Xeon 2.6Ghz (sage.math).   Multiplication is faster with mpc, but addition is significantly *slower*:

```
sage: K = MPComplexField(53)
sage: a = K(3.3902384)
sage: b = CC(3.3902384)

sage: timeit('a*a')
625 loops, best of 3: 376 ns per loop
sage: timeit('b*b')
625 loops, best of 3: 466 ns per loop

sage: timeit('a+a')
625 loops, best of 3: 368 ns per loop
sage: timeit('b+b')
625 loops, best of 3: 304 ns per loop

```

3. Powering doesn't work for mpc but it does for the current CC:

```
sage: a**a 
boom
```

4. Default rounding on coercion (or something?!) is different between MPC and CC:

```
sage: MPComplexField(100)(3.3902384)
3.3902383999999998742680418218 + 0.00000000000000000000000000000*I
sage: ComplexField(100)(3.3902384)
3.3902384000000000000000000000
```

5. With higher precision and nontrivial imaginary part, the timings are *all* in favor of the existing ComplexField already in Sage:

```
sage: K = MPComplexField(1000)
sage: a = K(3.3902384,9203483)
sage: b = ComplexField(1000)(3.3902384,9203483)

sage: timeit('a*a')
625 loops, best of 3: 2.27 µs per loop

625 loops, best of 3: 2.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit('a+a')
625 loops, best of 3: 515 ns per loop
sage: timeit('b+b')
625 loops, best of 3: 445 ns per loop

^P625 loops, best of 3: 221 µs per loop
sage: timeit('b.sin()')
625 loops, best of 3: 130 µs per loop
```

Thus until the above issues are addressed, I see no point in mpc going into sage.

almost every methods for ComplexNumbers are defined for MPComplexNumbers to.

The performance is quite good:
with a precision of 500bits,

The only big slow down is for `pow`.

It also allows to compute various trigonometric functions without convertion to pari.

<a id='comment:18'></a>First, I added a small patch to rebase this on sage 4.3.3.

One need to apply:

* mpc-0.8.1.patch
* bug_literal.patch
* trac4446-rebase_sage4.3.3.patch

in this order; and of course install the spkg:

* http://yann.laiglechapuy.net/spkg/mpc-0.8.1.p0.spkg

Then, here is an example with the exact input (I only put the last part concerning `pow`)

<a id='comment:20'></a>with the attached MPC program I get on a 2.83Ghz Core 2 under Fedora Core 2, with GMP 5.0.1 and
MPFR 2.4.2

```
tarte% ./sage
mpc_log took 74us per loop
mpc_exp took 24us per loop
mpc_pow(12345) took 260us per loop
mpc_div took 3.4us per loop
```
and within Sage with ComplexField I get (where I took the best of 3 %timeit runs):

```
sage: %timeit c=a.log()
625 loops, best of 3: 173 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c=a.exp()
625 loops, best of 3: 37.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c=a**12345
625 loops, best of 3: 26.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c=a/b
625 loops, best of 3: 2.71 µs per loop
```
thus we indeed need to work on powint, but the division is only 25% slower.

While doing this test I also noticed this strange thing with ComplexField:

```
sage: smallb = CC(b)
sage: %timeit c=a/b
625 loops, best of 3: 2.69 µs per loop
sage: %timeit c=a/smallb
625 loops, best of 3: 290 µs per loop
```
thus dividing by a 53-bit complex is 100 times slower than dividing by a 500-bit complex!
Should I open a separate ticket for that?

Did somebody check the 500-bit outputs of CC and MPC agree?

<a id='comment:32'></a>In the spkg-install I see above:

```
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "64 bit MacIntel"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 -fPIC"; export CFLAGS
   CXXLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 -fPIC"; export CXXFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
else
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fPIC"; export CFLAGS
fi
```

This will cause an issue that plagues a 64-bit port to OpenSolaris and Solaris 10. There is no reason to restrict the -m64 flag to be just OS X. It should be changed to:

```
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
   echo "Building a 64-bit version of MPC"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 -fPIC"; export CFLAGS
   CXXLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 -fPIC"; export CXXFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64 "; export LDFLAGS
else
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -fPIC"; export CFLAGS
fi
```

Was there a good reason for unsetting 'RM' in the spkg-install, or was it just one copied from some other package, which happened to do that? 

Most packages use 

* configure 
* make 
* make install

checking the error code of each of the 3 stages. This does 

* configure 
* make install

If 'make install' fails, there is no way to know if the build or installation failed. 

See

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#creating-a-new-spkg

for some information on that. I note looking at the above link, there is no code which does anything when SAGE64 is set to "yes". That is in my mind an error in the documentation. Clearly that was written even before a 64-bit OS X port was attempted. 

Also, SPKG.txt is an empty file - again see that link above for how that should be created.

after installing 'mpc-0.8.2svn793.spkg' ,
one needs to apply in order:
* mpc-0.8.1.patch
* bug_literal.patch
* trac4446-rebase_sage4.3.3.patch
* fix_declaration.patch

Tested with vanilla sage-4.4.3, Ubuntu 10.04, kernel 2.6.32-22-generic # 36-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 3 19:31:57 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU 650 `@` 3.20GHz.

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

The script 'spkg-install' is a mix between the template from:

and the script from the mpfr spkg. In particular, I don't know what is the point of the EXTRA flags, but thought they might be useful.

<a id='comment:38'></a>thank you David for your comments on this ticket. We (the MPC developers) have invested a lot of
time on this ticket (especially Philippe Theveny in 2008-2009, where at that time he was an
engineer paid by INRIA to work on MPFR and MPC), thus we would appreciate a lot if the Sage
developers could tell us right now in case they believe MPC will *never* become a standard package, so that we don't spend more time on this ticket.

As for the technical issues, I can answer a few ones:

- this package is based on svn version 793 just to speed up the `mpc_pow_si` computations.
  Note that if the Sage developers had requested this before, this could have been done for the
  last release (0.8.2). The changes wrt the 0.8.2 release are therefore minimal.

- about testing, you surely know that MPC is now a prerequisite to compile GCC 4.5
  (see http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html). You will find an extensive
  list of supported platforms on http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=platforms.

- about doctests, MPC is based on MPFR, which produces platform-independent results, thus the
  doctests do *not* depend on the platform, contrary to other numeric packages. This is one of
  the reasons MPC was chosen by GCC for constant folding.

- MPC is released under LGPL v2.1+.

If I recall correctly, the vote on sage-devel was positive for inclusion, once some of the objections were resolved.  I definitely see it becoming a standard package in Sage (and am willing to be the maintainer to make it so!)

Thank you Paul and Yann,

This clearly needs more than one person to agree to this, so I would think it right the ticket is discussed on the sage-devel mailing list. Before doing that, I just wanted to clarify if my understanding is correct. In particular, I'd like to know if the following comments seem a reasonable thing to post on sage-devel, asking if this should be a standard part of Sage. 

* MPC is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result.
* A trac ticket #4446 has been open for 20 months to add MPC to Sage, with 37 comments on it. 
* Although personally I don't know much about how this overlaps with other components in Sage, a number of Sage developers have put a lot of effort into ticket #4446, so there must be interest in this. 
* I personally believe the MPC library code should be of high quality as it is produced by a team of developers who in my personal opinion care about quality. 
* The MPC library is LGPL v 2.1+
* The license on one of the patches attached to the ticket #4446 is ambiguous, saying just "GPL", with nothing about version number(s), but I suspect that would be easy to resolve. 
* Both Linux on x86 and Solaris 10 on SPARC are primary platforms for MPC, but OS X is a secondary platform. 
* FreeBSD on x86 is a platform where a Sage port is in progress. FreeBSD is a primary platform for MPC, 
* OpenSolaris on x64, is a platform where a Sage port is in progress. This is not listed as even a tertiary platform for MPC, though in practice MPC passed all 57 tests for me on OpenSolaris x64 using gcc 4.4.4. (This was using Sage 4.4.4.alpha1, which uses MPIR 1.2.2 and MPFR 2.4.2.) 
* Solaris 10 on x86, is a platform where a Sage port is in progress. This is a tertiary platform for MPC, but with a report of all MPC library tests passing. 
* The Sage package initially presented for review (mpc-0.8.2svn793.spkg) failed to even build the test suite on Solaris or OpenSolaris, but a revised edition of the Sage package passes all tests on Ubuntu 10.04 64-bit, Solaris 10 (SPARC) 32-bit and OpenSolaris (x64) 64-bit. The initial problem was a mistake in the packaging for Sage, rather than the MPC library. 
* The package present for review is based on an SVN snapshot. Paul Zimmermann, an MPC developer, has said this minimal changes from the stable 0.82 release. Those changes were made to address a performance issue. 
* The Sage package is not currently "optional", but would need to be "standard". (There may or may not be ways of making it "optional", but William's comments on the trac ticket tended to suggest it could not be.) 
* The current package has not been tested much in Sage, and Yann who submitted the package does not have much more time to spend on it, so will not be asking William accounts to test on other platforms. 
* Currently nobody has volunteered to maintain the package.   
* A lot of work has been done on this ticket over a period of 20 months, so it would be a shame if that is wasted. 
* The MPC developers would appreciate a lot if the Sage developers could tell them right now if they believe MPC will never become a standard package, so they don't spend more time on ticket #4446. 
 
Do you feel I've overlooked something, or that is inaccurate? If you believe that is OK, I will ask on sage-devel if this should become a standard part of Sage.

Hi Paul, 

There is nothing I can do about this myself. I think you need to follow up on the thread I posted to sage-devel (see above). I asked about this and William responded with: 


''A while ago I tried out the proposed  MPC package for Sage, and it was
much slower than the multiprecision complex code that we already had
in Sage.  I wonder if these performance issues have been addressed?

 -- William''


I then responded with:

''It would appear the issue have been addressed. You would be in a better position
that me to determine if those issues are fully resolved. The last two entries in
the NEWS file are both related to performance.''

There really is little more I can do about this. I don't have the knowledge to evaluate the performance. You really need to convince William. 

BTW, what are the prequesites for this package? An updated spkg/install and updated spkg/standard/deps would be needed. You could usefully add them to the ticket. 


BTW, the author field is not filled in.

But you still need to create an spkg/install and spkg/standard/deps for this to be a standard package. I would attach them to the ticket.

Paul,
did you do any more on this? There seems to be four things needed here

* update spkg/install, to have something like 

```
MPC=`$newest mpc`
export MPC
```

* update spkg/standard/deps to have something like

```
all: $(BASE) \
   $(INST)/$(ATLAS)
...
   $(INST)/$(MPC))
...
   $(INST)/$(ZODB)
```

* Update spkg/standard/deps so it also has a line like this.  

```
$(INST)/$(MPC): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(MPIR) $(INST)/$(MPFR)
        $(INSTALL) "$(SAGE_SPKG) $(MPC) 2>&1" "tee -a $(SAGE_LOGS)/$(MPC).log"

```
* Convince William that's this is necessary and not slower than what's in Sage, which was his objection before. I started a thread for you - see http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/c8363227c72b6918 but you have not written anything on it.

> I'm "out there".   Is it necessary and not slower than what is in Sage already?  I'm willing to take your (=Paul's) word for it, assuming you say you've done some benchmarks.   Also, rounding might be (vastly) better in mpc, which would be another point in its favor.

For the accuracy, I've computed the maximal relative error on the real or imaginary part after
1000 random tries for several operations. My program also prints the inputs that give the
corresponding maximal error:

I used the following programs:

```
def check(res,ref):
   if ref.real() == 0.0:
      if res.real() <> 0.0:
         err_real = +Infinity
      else:
         err_real = 0.0
   else:
      err_real = RR((res.real()-ref.real()).abs()/ref.real().abs())
   if ref.imag() == 0.0:
      if res.imag() <> 0.0:
         err_imag = +Infinity
      else:
         err_imag = 0.0
   else:
      err_imag = RR((res.imag()-ref.imag()).abs()/ref.imag().abs())
   return max(err_real,err_imag)

def foo(p):
   K=MPComplexField(p)
   L=ComplexField(p)
   K2=MPComplexField(p+20)
   L2=ComplexField(p+20)
   max_erra = 0
   max_errb = 0
   ina = 0
   inb = 0
   for i in range(10^3):
      b = L.random_element()
      br = b.real()
      bi = b.imag()
      a = K(b)
      c = L.random_element()
      cr = b.real()
      ci = b.imag()
      d = K(c)
      aa=cos(a) # change to a*d for multiplication
      bb=cos(b) # change to b*c for multiplication
      ref = cos(K2(a)) # change to K2(a)*K2(d) for multiplication
      erra = check(K2(aa),ref)
      errb = check(K2(bb),ref)
      if erra > max_erra:
         max_erra = erra
         ina = a, d
      if errb > max_errb:
         max_errb = errb
         inb = b, c
   print "MPC: ", max_erra, ina
   print "CC:  ", max_errb, inb
```
The conclusion is that MPC is in the majority of the cases faster than ComplexField (the only
exception being the division) and always more accurate, with a ratio of a factor up to 
3941 (i.e., about 12 bits) for the 53-bit division.

For MPC we observe that the maximal relative error is --- as guaranteed by MPC --- always less than 1/2 ulp (unit in last place) which corresponds to a relative error of 2**(-p), i.e., 1.12e-16 for p=53 and 7.89e-31 for p=100.

I thus give a positive review to Yann's patch.

Paul

After applying the patch but not installing the optional package, I get

```
        sage -t -long  devel/sage/sage/rings/complex_mpc.pyx # 454 doctests failed
```
Should all of the tests in `complex_mpc.pyx` be tagged with `#optional - mpc` (see [this section of the developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#further-conventions-for-automated-testing-of-examples))?  (I don't know if there's a easier way.)  Or am I mistaken?

I had no time, but here it is. All doctests are now marked "# optional - Mpc'

I hope I choose the good version, it's the one used one the Mpc library web page.

Back to the stuff I have to do, I'm late now...
