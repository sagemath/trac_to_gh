<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
I fixed a bunch of issues: 

* put the repo back in. *Never* remove the hg repo in an spkg.
* put back "exit 1" in case either one of the python modules fails to build
* moved setup.py into patches where it belongs
* checked in all the changes
* removed OSX crap files, i.e. `._*`

With those changes I give this spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc0/biopython-1.47.spkg

a positive review. Please base future spkgs on this one since I did not increment the patch level.

Cheers,

Michael
