Both this and #5337 are fixed in the current version of the French tutorial available from 
http://algo.inria.fr/mezzarobba/sagetutfr/sagetut-fr.tgz
But (afaik) the French translation has never been merged into the main Sage documentation, so I reopened this ticket following Mike Hansen's comment (see #5337).

Hmm, I had not noticed it, but in fact there is a version of the French translation in the main repository since since the end of February, and this seems to be fixed there.

I think there is no need to know French: if I understand correctly, all this ticket asks for is that the output of the first example of the section

http://www.sagemath.org/fr/tutorial/tour_algebra.html#section-systems

agrees with that of the English version

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/tour_algebra.html#section-systems

(which is indeed the case).
