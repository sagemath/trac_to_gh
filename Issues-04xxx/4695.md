The attached patch adds support for pari's rnfidealdown.  This is simple but exposes a weakness in Sage's number field relativize() function, which I address at the same time.  Namely, relativize always constructs a new base number field and embedding rather than (possibly) using an existing one.  The doctests are extensive and reveal (and document!) a bug in the existing code.

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**CC:**  was cc

**Keywords:** relative rnf ideal down

**Resolution:** fixed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4695

I read through the code and the only problem I have is that  

```
def rnfidealdown(self, x): 
```
has no docstring or doctest, which violates our 100% coverage rule.

Also, a bunch of doctests fail on x86_64 linux (sage.math), and these all have to get fixed.  So once these are fixed and the above function has a doctest, I'll be happy.  The doctest failures (except the segfault) look like some kind of randomness in the output.

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with `_sig_`on, `_sig_`off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.

4695-ncalexan-rnfidealdown.2.patch addresses the referee's concerns and implements relativize over relative fields.  This required updating the number field isomorphisms to the newer coercion model.  Along the way I added lots of doctests.

I haven't addressed the crashes on sage.math.
