Jaap,

can you please open a ticket for that one. I suspect that we don't
have anything tested via long or that the tests aren't properly marked
"#long time". This one has popped up so often that we really ought to
fix it once and for all since you hit it every time.

[...]

Cheers,

Michael

Hi Dan,

that sounds fine to me, but we should do that on another ticket post Sage 3.2.
