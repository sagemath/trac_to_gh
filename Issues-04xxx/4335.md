```
Given a space of CuspForms, there is a newforms method which gives a list of newforms associated to that space, with a name specified by the user. However, this does not seem to work correctly at the moment:

```
sage: S=CuspForms(23)
sage: S.newforms('b')
[q + a0*q^2 + (-2*a0 - 1)*q^3 + (-a0 - 1)*q^4 + 2*a0*q^5 + O(q^6)]
```

I think that the newforms code should be changed to something like:

```
def newforms(self, names=None):
        """
        Return all cusp forms in the cuspidal subspace of self.
        
        EXAMPLES:
        
        sage: CuspForms(23).newforms('b')
        [q + b0*q^2 + (-2*b0 - 1)*q^3 + (-b0 - 1)*q^4 + 2*b0*q^5 + O(q^6)]
        """
        M = self.modular_symbols(sign=1)
        factors = M.cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace().decomposition()
        large_dims = [ X.dimension() for X in factors if X.dimension() != 1 ]
        if len(large_dims) > 0 and names is None:            
            names = 'a'
        return [ element.Newform(self, factors[i], names=(names+str(i)) )
                 for i in range(len(factors)) ]
```
(removing the ValueError statement) as this should correctly use the user-specified name if one is given or default to 'a' if one is not.

Lloyd,

Thanks for pointing this out!  I guess we only ever tested with 'a'.  This will be good fodder for bug day on Thursday...

Sorry, I couldn't wait until Thursday. :) I think William's comment is right -- I probably just never tested this with anything except `a`, since that's the letter I usually use. 

However, raising an error if no variable name is provided is, in fact, the intended behavior -- basically obeying the rule of "explicit is better than implicit."

We've systematically made that decision throughout all Sage, so we should stick with that here.

That said, we have also talked about making it so one can specify a uniform default throughout sage, e.g., a function f(n) that takes as input an integer n and outputs a variable name.  You could define it to be anything you want and everywhere in Sage that requires variables would call it -- if specified instead of giving an error, when you forget to give a variable name.
