When one creates a new worksheet, it would be nice if the sage process started up in the background right then, rather than wait till one types the first command. Currently there is an annoying lag...

I'm closing this, since we now start a worksheet when it's first served.  From `twist.py`, around line #1514:

```python
class Worksheet(WorksheetResource, resource.Resource):
    addSlash = True

    def render(self, ctx):
        self.worksheet.sage()
        s = notebook.html(worksheet_filename = self.name,  username=self.username)
        return HTMLResponse(stream=s)
```
I've also confirmed this with a print statement in `Worksheet.sage`.

By the way, the patch here appears to be for a different ticket.
