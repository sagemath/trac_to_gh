I'm closing this, since we now start a worksheet when it's first served.  From `twist.py`, around line #1514:

```python
class Worksheet(WorksheetResource, resource.Resource):
    addSlash = True

    def render(self, ctx):
        self.worksheet.sage()
        s = notebook.html(worksheet_filename = self.name,  username=self.username)
        return HTMLResponse(stream=s)
```
I've also confirmed this with a print statement in `Worksheet.sage`.

By the way, the patch here appears to be for a different ticket.
