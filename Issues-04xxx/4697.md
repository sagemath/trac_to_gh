Fix the following instance by a trivial change to raising an exception.  This causes tons of confusion for (new) users, since there isn't any way to easily "discover" what to do.

I think the latter is more intuitive; in fact, I would go as far as to
do something like this:

 ... Is x positive or negative? (Try the assume(x>0) command before
 integral evaluation)

Thanks,

This patch improves the error message Sage sends along with the Maxima constraint request.  The message is rather longish, but here probably extreme clarity is best, based on the original reporter's point about new users.  Some doctests for the _expect_expr function are also added.

This passes testing interfaces/maxima.py, and should be okay on calculus.py (which I can't test because it always times out); I couldn't find any other references to this error message but I think I got them all.

This was a positive review by the way :) - I just forgot to add it to the doctest comment. Nice docstring and doctesting by the way, too.
