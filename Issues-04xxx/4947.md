Note: this is NOT a duplicate of #4363.

Since 3.2.2 (possibly 3.2.1?), worksheets which contain `@`interact cells auto-launch when the notebook is started.  This is an extremely serious problem for notebooks with many such worksheets.

Are you sure???   This would be so wrong/horrible, that I would think I would have noticed.  Also, I can't imagine how this is possible; from my understanding of the notebook code, this is highly unlikely to happen.   Finally, I tried creating a worksheet with an interact cell on my laptop with sage-3.2.3 then restarting the sage notebook server, and that worksheet was *not* running.  In only started running when I clicked to open the worksheet.

Can you please check that you didn't just get confused?  Thanks.

I just checked on the public sagenb.org, and *did* observe this behavior.  So it does happen systematically on some installs.  This is obviously a terrible bug.

After a non-expert look at all changesets for 3.2.2, the only one that really stuck out was #3950 - not that there was anything immediately obvious in it that would cause this behavior, but it seemed to be the only nontrivial change to the notebook.  There were a few others that touched it, though all (including this one) seemed to be mostly on the listing of worksheets or html, not starting processes!

Is it possible that #3950 could have opened each worksheet, and when doing that, #4363 kicks in and starts running things?

TimothyClemans, can you look at this and see if #3950 caused the problem?
