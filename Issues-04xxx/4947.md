Note: this is NOT a duplicate of #4363.

Since 3.2.2 (possibly 3.2.1?), worksheets which contain `@`interact cells auto-launch when the notebook is started.  This is an extremely serious problem for notebooks with many such worksheets.

Are you sure???   This would be so wrong/horrible, that I would think I would have noticed.  Also, I can't imagine how this is possible; from my understanding of the notebook code, this is highly unlikely to happen.   Finally, I tried creating a worksheet with an interact cell on my laptop with sage-3.2.3 then restarting the sage notebook server, and that worksheet was *not* running.  In only started running when I clicked to open the worksheet.

Can you please check that you didn't just get confused?  Thanks.

Is it possible that #3950 could have opened each worksheet, and when doing that, #4363 kicks in and starts running things?

TimothyClemans, can you look at this and see if #3950 caused the problem?
