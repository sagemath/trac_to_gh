Update to `zn_poly` version 0.9.

Also included is a minor patch for hypellfrob (this is necessary since hypellfrob was using `zn_poly` internals in a naughty way --- bad design on my part, and now fixed).

You need to install the spkg first, then apply the hypellfrob patch and force a rebuild (touch `devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob.pyx` if necessary).

Thanks malb.

Probably not a good idea to use it as the backend yet. I'm working on it, and that's my eventual goal, but whereas multiplication and middle product are pretty good, division support is still poor.

I valgrinded (valground?) "make check" on sage.math, but not the full "test all" and not from within sage. There was a single leak of 2500 bytes, which is in GMP's mpn_random2 function, which is not used outside the test suite.

A couple remarks:

* Please do not attach spkgs to trac, instead link them from some webspace.
* The version patches by Tim break on every BSD and Solaris where we do not use the GNU ld per default. We now work around this by linking gld to ld, but this is *not* a long term solution. Sage in general does not benefit from versioned libraries, indeed they case a bunch of problems when linking extensions, due to the links the archives get larger and on top of that it makes the memory address space on Cygwin even more scare, so I intend to remove every one of those version patches in the future.

+print "\t$(CC) -m64 -single_module -fPIC -dynamiclib -o libzn_poly.dylib $(LIBOBJS) $(LIBS)"
+print
```

But it is late, so I will take the easy way out instead of fixing the problem the right way :)

David,

an updated spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.3/alpha2/zn_poly-0.9.p0.spkg

It contains the 64 bit OSX fixes and some small fixes to spkg-install. Please make sure to base your next spkg on this one ;)

Cheers,

Michael

I don't really understand the issues here, and I see malb has just opened a thread on sage-devel, so I'll leave this to the experts to thrash out, and I'll be sure to follow their recommendations in future :-)

>  * My OSX 64 bit fixes are not in the spkg since this one was based on 0.8.p1, not p2. Please make sure that in the future you case new spkgs on the latest one in Sage.


Oops, sorry about that.
