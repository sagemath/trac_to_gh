Update to `zn_poly` version 0.9.

Also included is a minor patch for hypellfrob (this is necessary since hypellfrob was using `zn_poly` internals in a naughty way --- bad design on my part, and now fixed).

You need to install the spkg first, then apply the hypellfrob patch and force a rebuild (touch `devel/sage/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hypellfrob.pyx` if necessary).

I don't really understand the issues here, and I see malb has just opened a thread on sage-devel, so I'll leave this to the experts to thrash out, and I'll be sure to follow their recommendations in future :-)

> * My OSX 64 bit fixes are not in the spkg since this one was based on 0.8.p1, not p2. Please make sure that in the future you case new spkgs on the latest one in Sage.

Oops, sorry about that.
