This patches adds symbolic gamma and factorial functions.

The symbolic factorial is named fact for now, so it does not clash with sage.rings.arith.factorial

Some initial comments.

The first patch still need a lot of doctests added.  The docstring in the second patch just needs to be reformatted.

Also, this shouldn't go in as is with the function named 'fact'.  #4433 changes this.

The new patch keeps the algorithm keyword for the symbolic factorial.
It also keeps the docstrings from the nonsymbolic functions, plus some new doctests.

Michael,

I probably have to read the Mercurial documentation.

I'm not sure if I measure the performance correctly, but if I do

```
def f(n):
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += factorial(2^i)
    return s.ndigits()

def g(n):
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += gamma((1.8)^i)
    return s

def h(n):
    set_random_seed(0)
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += gamma(random())
    return s

timeit('f(22)')
timeit('g(22)')
timeit('h(10^4)')
```

I get the following:

on sage-3.2 without the patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.16 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 5.38 s per loop
```

with trac_4432.patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.18 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 1.67 s per loop
```

with trac_4432.patch + trac_4432-gamma.patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.17 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 5.45 s per loop
```

So trac_4432.patch is much faster for small values of the gamma function
because we are not computing over the complex numbers.

Also only with trac_4432.patch

```
plot(gamma, 1, 4)
```
works. But this also doesn't work with the current code.

Greetings,

Wilfried
