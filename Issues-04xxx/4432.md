This patches adds symbolic gamma and factorial functions.

The symbolic factorial is named fact for now, so it does not clash with sage.rings.arith.factorial

Component: **calculus**

Some initial comments.

The first patch still need a lot of doctests added.  The docstring in the second patch just needs to be reformatted.

Also, this shouldn't go in as is with the function named 'fact'.  #4433 changes this.

Michael,

I probably have to read the Mercurial documentation.

I'm not sure if I measure the performance correctly, but if I do

```
def f(n):
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += factorial(2^i)
    return s.ndigits()

def g(n):
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += gamma((1.8)^i)
    return s

def h(n):
    set_random_seed(0)
    s = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        s += gamma(random())
    return s

timeit('f(22)')
timeit('g(22)')
timeit('h(10^4)')
```

I get the following:

on sage-3.2 without the patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.16 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 5.38 s per loop
```

with trac_4432.patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.18 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 1.67 s per loop
```

with trac_4432.patch + trac_4432-gamma.patch

```
5 loops, best of 3: 10.9 s per loop
125 loops, best of 3: 4.17 ms per loop
5 loops, best of 3: 5.45 s per loop
```

So trac_4432.patch is much faster for small values of the gamma function
because we are not computing over the complex numbers.

Also only with trac_4432.patch

```
plot(gamma, 1, 4)
```

I fixed the doctests and the plotting of the gamma function, with
[attachment: trac_4432-plot-doc.patch.](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4432/trac_4432-plot-doc.patch..gz)

Also

```
sage: timeit('h(10^4)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.68 s per loop
```
