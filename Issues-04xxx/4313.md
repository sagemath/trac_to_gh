The attached patch (based on 3.1.4) makes two changes in libs/cremona/mat*:
1. Adds getitem methods to the matric class so i,j entries may be extracted;
2. Changes the conversion to sage of matrices so that matrices over ZZ are constructed instead of QQ.

These were done as part of a hands-on tutorial William gave to John in Bordeaux.

Code looks good. Only thing needed are some doctests on `__getitem__` in `mat.pyx` -- it would be nice to see a few doctests there, especially ones written to test weird corner cases.

(Also edited a typo in the description for this ticket.)

I added a docstring for the getitem function with doctest, and also fixed one other doctest.  Now the coverage is 100% (though there is no loads(dumps) test).

Should work on 4.0.
