Hi,

Is there a reason why, in sage 3.2.2, the following works :

sage: vector(vector((1, 6)))
(1, 6)

but the following doesn't :

sage: vector(vector((1, 6.8)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: _vector_() takes exactly one argument (0 given)

???

Thank you,

Sébastien Labbé

I want also to mention that the same problem was occuring when using the Symbolic Ring :

```
sage: vector(vector(SR, (1, sqrt(2)) ) )
```
