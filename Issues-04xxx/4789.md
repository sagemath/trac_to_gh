Example:

```
sage: a = matrix(RDF,4,[1..16])*1.293949599304953485; a
[ 1.2939495993 2.58789919861 3.88184879791 5.17579839722]
[6.46974799652 7.76369759583 9.05764719513 10.3515967944]
[11.6455463937  12.939495993 14.2334455924 15.5273951917]
[ 16.821344791 18.1152943903 19.4092439896 20.7031935889]
sage: a.kernel()
Vector space of degree 4 and dimension 0 over Real Double Field
Basis matrix:
[]
```
Define this from the email linked to above:

```
import scipy
import scipy.linalg

def null(A, eps=1e-15):
    """
    computes the null space of the real matrix A
    """
    n, m = scipy.shape(A)
    if n > m :
        return scipy.transpose(null(scipy.transpose(A), eps))
        return null(scipy.transpose(A), eps)
    u, s, vh = scipy.linalg.svd(A)
    s=scipy.append(s,scipy.zeros(m))[0:m]
    null_mask = (s <= eps)
    null_space = scipy.compress(null_mask, vh, axis=0)
    return scipy.transpose(null_space)
```

Then:

```
sage: null(a.numpy(),eps=1e-13)
array([[-0.29797676,  0.45957573],
       [ 0.73984987, -0.39066887],
       [-0.58576946, -0.59738944],
       [ 0.14389635,  0.52848258]])
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
