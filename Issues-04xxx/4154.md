There ought to be a way to set defaults for the options to show.  Even just a dictionary in sage.plot.plot would be nice.

A use-case would be setting the default aspect ratio to 1 so that if you are plotting lots of circles, it looks okay.

I guess

```
sage.plot.plot.Graphics.SHOW_OPTIONS["aspect_ratio"] = 1
```
does what was requested in this ticket (although I don't think that it is the best way).

I am switching this ticket to positive review so that release managers can close it appropriately.

I agree with your assessment.

If you're interested in reviewing a ticket that deals with setting aspect ratios to more sensible defaults, and clarifying what Sage/Matplotlib means by aspect ratio, #2100 is up for review.
