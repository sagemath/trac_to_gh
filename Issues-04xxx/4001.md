... and to be honest I had not applied the patch, just read it!

Patch applies ok to 3.1.2.alpha2, doctests in sage.rings.polynomial all pass.

By the way, `x<sup>(2</sup>25)` works ok too, but `x<sup>(2</sup>30)` causes Sage to crash:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```
Does that mean that your new special code should have _sig_on, _sig_off?

Yes, I've just updated the patch. I'm not going to write a doctest for this, since it unnecessarily slows down the user's computer by filling up his/her RAM ... on a related note: Incredible in how many ways I can screw up such a short patch.
