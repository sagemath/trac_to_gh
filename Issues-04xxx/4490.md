Shouldn't this be on a worksheet settings page rather than adding another checkbox?  

I'm not a fan of the implicit multiplication mode since it adds yet another level of language incompatible with Python.

Even on the settings page, it seems superfluous - makes more sense to put it in a init.sage file.  Curious if either of the original discussers care if I close this as wontfix.
