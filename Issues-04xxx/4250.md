Of course, doing

```
sage: R.<t>=QQ[]
sage: 2**t
```
should result in a traceback. In fact it does so for `R.<t>=ZZ[]`. But over `QQ`, it crashes with a segmentation fault.

Running `sage -gdb` yields a very long output, too long to reproduce it here, and sorry that I don't know how to save the output of `bt`.

I use Sage version 3.1.2, and it occurs on two different Linux machines.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
The segfault is caused by an infinite loop, where 2 is cast to a polynomial and its `__pow__` method is called, and the polynomial ring calls the `__pow__` method of the base ring on constant polynomials.
