Here are some more fixes. With this, and the latest state of the

http://hg.cython.org/cython

repo, all the relevant tests seem to pass. I do get two failures (due to Cython upgrade? something else?), see test.log in

/home/dagss/sage-4.0.2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux

Once this works let's tag http://hg.cython.org/cython as 0.11.2.1 for #6438?
