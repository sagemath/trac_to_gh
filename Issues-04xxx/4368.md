The following snippet is from the attached patch **trac_4368.patch**:

```
+def attrcall(name, *args, **kwds):
+    """
+    Returns a callable which takes in an object, gets the method
+    named name from that objects, and calls it with the specified
+    arguments and keywords.
```
Why "named name from that _objects_"? (my emphasis) My understanding is that I can pass in an object (not more than one) to the proposed class `AttrCallObject`. If you mean that I can pass in only one object in order to get a returned callable, then you might want to consider the following documentation change:

```
-named name from that objects, and calls it with the specified
+named name from that object, and calls it with the specified
```
