sage: An error occurred while installing libm4ri-20080901
```

The first error is a typo of a variable name and an unprotected expand of it in a shell test.  This test only occurs on systems that do not have

/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/size

which are gratuitously assumed to all be running x86 except if the cpu vendor is Intel in which case they are assumed to not have a cache.  

And this leads us to the second problem, on non-x86 cpus, since the cache size cannot be discovered with cpuid, a later conversion of this cache size from hex fails miserably.

This is a mess.

(I should have done a search before creating this one, damn you late hours of the night)

Yes with this spkg it builds fine, but it does not detect the amount of cache.  I don't know if this is critical for m4ri, but mine does detect it.

```
checking for x86 cpuid 0x0 output... unknown
checking for the processor vendor... Unknown
checking the L1 cache size... 0 Bytes
checking the L2 cache size... 0 Bytes
checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... (cached) yes
```

I know that on this machine I have 32K L1 D-cache and 1M L2 cache.

Also the new package generates these warnings

```

```

While the existence of the package at #4042 does lower the priority on this one, I think the cache detection parts should be merged. So I attached a patch against libm4ri-20080903 for the m4/ax_cache_size.m4 file to add the cache size detection code.  

There is also a test spkg here: http://celas.ath.cx/anakha/libm4ri-20080903.p0.spkg

Do not merge this spkg as I think it is too late for me to figure out how to properly rebuild the configure script.  Thus, it rebuilds itself every time you build the package making you suffer two times the configuration phase.

A new SPKG is available at

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/libm4ri-20080904.spkg

with the patch applied.

It builds and passes tests on:
* my notebook (Linux, x86_64, Core2Duo)
* cleo (Linux, ia64)
* iras (Linux, ia64, L1 and L2 not detected) 
* bsd (OSX, x86, L1 not detected)
* sage.math (Linux, x86_64, Opteron)
* VirtualBox (OpenSolaris, x86, Core2Duo, L1 and L2 not detected)

So it is still not perfect but should be better (OSX PPC support). I don't have access to a PPC box to test it.

It works on my machine (OS X, ppc G5) and all tests pass.

A minor cosmetic change that it seems I forgot in my patch is to change the redirection in the sysctl lines to read:

> /dev/null 2>&1


because otherwise the cache size are printed on their own in the configure output.  This does not harm the results in any way but can be annoying when looking at the configure output (but who does that anyway :)

As for the other failure, could someone with 10.4 access run these commands and port the output:

```
$ sysctl -n hw.foo

This means sysctl does not return an error when the name is not found on 10.4 which lead to the above error encountered by mabshoff.
