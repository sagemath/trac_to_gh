Robert, I've looked at (probably every line of) your code which is now in here -- can you review the rest? I did make small changes to one or two of your functions; in particular, `parse_deps`, I think.

I've run it through some paces, but I'm happy to fix any bugs that pop up.

Credit should go to Rob, Gonzalo, and me.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I am giving a positive review to all the changes that move the extensions to the new file. But we need a formal review for Robert's changes and since Craig was involved here, too, I am not so sure who would review what portion of those.

I am testing a vanilla tree with the fixes here and #4500 applied, so I should be able to at least see if everything works as expected when combining all pieces into a virgin  build.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael
