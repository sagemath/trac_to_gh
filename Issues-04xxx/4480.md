I've run it through some paces, but I'm happy to fix any bugs that pop up.

Credit should go to Rob, Gonzalo, and me.

I am giving a positive review to all the changes that move the extensions to the new file. But we need a formal review for Robert's changes and since Craig was involved here, too, I am not so sure who would review what portion of those.

I am testing a vanilla tree with the fixes here and #4500 applied, so I should be able to at least see if everything works as expected when combining all pieces into a virgin  build.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

In addition to mabshoff's fix at #4500, I think we should add the following:

```

 if not os.environ.has_key('SAGE_ROOT'):
     print "    ERROR: The environment variable SAGE_ROOT must be defined."
```

This just turns warnings back off -- as William points out, it's a lot of output for the unsuspecting. Michael and I had discussed this when we changed it, and it would be good to sit down and actually look at the warnings once to see if anything interesting is being turned up. In the interim, though, let's not spam. ;)
