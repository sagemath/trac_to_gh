Here we go! So this patch applies on top of `rc0` + the patch at #4500, because it was a needed fix. With this patch in, we've got it all: fast cached dependency checking, parallel calls to Cython, and dozens of small improvements to the build system thrown in, too. I also reorganized `setup.py` and created a `module_list.py` to have the list of extension modules. 

Robert, I've looked at (probably every line of) your code which is now in here -- can you review the rest? I did make small changes to one or two of your functions; in particular, `parse_deps`, I think.

I've run it through some paces, but I'm happy to fix any bugs that pop up.

Credit should go to Rob, Gonzalo, and me.

I am giving a positive review to all the changes that move the extensions to the new file. But we need a formal review for Robert's changes and since Craig was involved here, too, I am not so sure who would review what portion of those.

I am testing a vanilla tree with the fixes here and #4500 applied, so I should be able to at least see if everything works as expected when combining all pieces into a virgin  build.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, but you should also apply 

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4500/trac-4500.patch

in this context. I found an issue when building from vanilla with both the last patch here and trac-4500.patch applied and there is an issue that I mentioned on the other ticket with a work around fix, but I am not sure if it is the correct fix. It does work, but that does not mean that it is either elegant or proper.

This just turns warnings back off -- as William points out, it's a lot of output for the unsuspecting.
