Here we go! So this patch applies on top of `rc0` + the patch at #4500, because it was a needed fix. With this patch in, we've got it all: fast cached dependency checking, parallel calls to Cython, and dozens of small improvements to the build system thrown in, too. I also reorganized `setup.py` and created a `module_list.py` to have the list of extension modules. 

Robert, I've looked at (probably every line of) your code which is now in here -- can you review the rest? I did make small changes to one or two of your functions; in particular, `parse_deps`, I think.

I've run it through some paces, but I'm happy to fix any bugs that pop up.

Credit should go to Rob, Gonzalo, and me.

I am giving a positive review to all the changes that move the extensions to the new file. But we need a formal review for Robert's changes and since Craig was involved here, too, I am not so sure who would review what portion of those.

I am testing a vanilla tree with the fixes here and #4500 applied, so I should be able to at least see if everything works as expected when combining all pieces into a virgin  build.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Yes, but you should also apply 

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/4500/trac-4500.patch

in this context. I found an issue when building from vanilla with both the last patch here and trac-4500.patch applied and there is an issue that I mentioned on the other ticket with a work around fix, but I am not sure if it is the correct fix. It does work, but that does not mean that it is either elegant or proper.

In addition to mabshoff's fix at #4500, I think we should add the following:

```

```

This just turns warnings back off -- as William points out, it's a lot of output for the unsuspecting. Michael and I had discussed this when we changed it, and it would be good to sit down and actually look at the warnings once to see if anything interesting is being turned up. In the interim, though, let's not spam. ;)
