At the tail end of a composition series of a group, the trivial subgroup has no generators, rather than the identity permutation as a generator.  This appears unacceptable to GAP for subsequent computations.

I'm guessing that this this ticket is not named accurately. 

It appears the problem isn't with the composition series but with the order function:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([])
sage: G.order()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
<snip>
```
This will possibly raise the issue of whether the trivial group should be PermutationGroup([]) (as it is now) or PermutationGroup([()]) (for which order works). According to Rotman, the group whose generating set is the empty set is the trivial group, so I think they way we have it is fine. Therefore, I elected to simply fix this bug in the order method. 
Patch attached is based on sage-3.2.alpha1 and pases sage -t.

I agree that a constructor with an empty list should be interpreted as the trivial subgroup, but it seems that passing this to GAP will cause an error.  On 3.1.4 I get a different error message than David, which suggests that GAP doesn't like the construction.

Calling other commands on a group with no generators (such as exponent() or is_simple() or derived_series()), yields an error similar (or identical) to the one from a call to order().

Furthermore, it appears that until recently composition_series() returned a trivial subgroup with the identity element as a generator for the tail end of the series.  For example, see sample output in [3364](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/3364).

It seems to me that having the output of one command be acceptable to all subsequent commands is preferable.  The experiment below suggests to me that GAP doesn't like an empty list of generators.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:9\" align=\"right\">comment:9</div>\n\nWith regards to (b), I'm suggesting the opposite.  Seems easier, and more consistent, to return composition_series() to its previous behavior, rather than having it generate objects that subsequently GAP cannot digest.  In other words, adjust only the behavior of composition_series().   I am NOT suggesting that all the methods acting on groups be adjusted to accept a trivial subgroup specified with no generators.\n\nSo I guess I'm suggesting more broadly that an empty list of generators not be possible (even if it makes sense mathematically).  I don't have enough experience with the other parts of Sage to know how it is handled for other objects (like rings).  But if GAP isn't happy with an empty list, then I think the effort should be made to make sure the output of methods for groups produces items appropriate as input to other commands using GAP to do their work.  Or maybe the interface to GAP should convert empty lists to a list with the identity?  That would be another solution.\n\nOne possibility would be to have the constructors for groups recognize and convert an empty list of generators into a list holding just the identity permutation.  But again, I don't have enough experience to know if this would be feasible or desirable.\n\nRob",

With regards to (b), I'm suggesting the opposite.  Seems easier, and more consistent, to return composition_series() to its previous behavior, rather than having it generate objects that subsequently GAP cannot digest.  In other words, adjust only the behavior of composition_series().   I am NOT suggesting that all the methods acting on groups be adjusted to accept a trivial subgroup specified with no generators.

So I guess I'm suggesting more broadly that an empty list of generators not be possible (even if it makes sense mathematically).  I don't have enough experience with the other parts of Sage to know how it is handled for other objects (like rings).  But if GAP isn't happy with an empty list, then I think the effort should be made to make sure the output of methods for groups produces items appropriate as input to other commands using GAP to do their work.  Or maybe the interface to GAP should convert empty lists to a list with the identity?  That would be another solution.

One possibility would be to have the constructors for groups recognize and convert an empty list of generators into a list holding just the identity permutation.  But again, I don't have enough experience to know if this would be feasible or desirable.
