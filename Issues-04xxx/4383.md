At the tail end of a composition series of a group, the trivial subgroup has no generators, rather than the identity permutation as a generator.  This appears unacceptable to GAP for subsequent computations.

On 3.1.4 built from source on x86.

```
sage: G=CyclicPermutationGroup(2)
sage: comps
```

```
[Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)],
 Permutation Group with generators []]
```

```
sage: comps[1].order()
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I'm guessing that this this ticket is not named accurately. 

It appears the problem isn't with the composition series but with the order function:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([])
sage: G.order()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
<snip>
```
This will possibly raise the issue of whether the trivial group should be PermutationGroup([]) (as it is now) or PermutationGroup([()]) (for which order works). According to Rotman, the group whose generating set is the empty set is the trivial group, so I think they way we have it is fine. Therefore, I elected to simply fix this bug in the order method. 
Patch attached is based on sage-3.2.alpha1 and pases sage -t.
