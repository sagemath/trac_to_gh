At the tail end of a composition series of a group, the trivial subgroup has no generators, rather than the identity permutation as a generator.  This appears unacceptable to GAP for subsequent computations.

On 3.1.4 built from source on x86.

```
sage: G=CyclicPermutationGroup(2)
sage: comps
```

```
[Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)],
 Permutation Group with generators []]
```

```
sage: comps[1].order()
```

I'm guessing that this this ticket is not named accurately. 

It appears the problem isn't with the composition series but with the order function:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([])
sage: G.order()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
<snip>
```
This will possibly raise the issue of whether the trivial group should be PermutationGroup([]) (as it is now) or PermutationGroup([()]) (for which order works). According to Rotman, the group whose generating set is the empty set is the trivial group, so I think they way we have it is fine. Therefore, I elected to simply fix this bug in the order method. 
Patch attached is based on sage-3.2.alpha1 and pases sage -t.

I agree that a constructor with an empty list should be interpreted as the trivial subgroup, but it seems that passing this to GAP will cause an error.  On 3.1.4 I get a different error message than David, which suggests that GAP doesn't like the construction.

Calling other commands on a group with no generators (such as exponent() or is_simple() or derived_series()), yields an error similar (or identical) to the one from a call to order().

Furthermore, it appears that until recently composition_series() returned a trivial subgroup with the identity element as a generator for the tail end of the series.  For example, see sample output in [3364](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/3364).

It seems to me that having the output of one command be acceptable to all subsequent commands is preferable.  The experiment below suggests to me that GAP doesn't like an empty list of generators.

REFEREE REPORT:

Huh?  


* trac_4383-order-trivial-permgp.patch + trac_4383-order-trivial-permgp2.patch  make some sense to me with the second patch fixing a bug introduced in the first and adding doctests.

* trac_4383-order-trivial-permgp3.patch looks to me like exactly the same (?) as the first buggy patch!  So maybe you forgot to attach the right patch?

Please clarify and ping me.
