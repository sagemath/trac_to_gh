list(M) and M.list() returning different lists is inconsistent. As discussed at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/a7d8b439df769e7 we should have  M.entries() which replaces M.list() and deprecate the latter. 

The behavior of list(M) will remain the same, and consistency with M[i].

A reason to have m.list() return the entries is that m.dict() returns the entries, but in "sparse" dictionary format.

I was coding, and I realized that I very strongly object to this ticket -- or at least the nebulousness of it -- I can't even write the code i want the way I want since I know that it will just break for sure as soon as somebody closes this ticket :-(.  For me it is an incredibly important design pattern when working with matrices to turn the entire matrix into a list of its entries -- do something with them -- then use the resulting list to make another matrix. 

This is exactly modeled on Magma's `Eltseq` command, which turns almost anything in Magma into a linear sequence, and almost anything in Magma can be reconstructed from that sequence.  

Anyway, the list method is not just one off thing that doesn't matter -- it's central to matrices.  So either wontfix this ticket or do it asap to get the pain over with.

I do worry that changing this is changing things for change sake, and I'm not convinced that is a good idea...

I have a partial patch for this.  I also worry that we are just changing things to change things, though I agree slightly that the new name (M.entries) is better than M.list in that it is more descriptive.

Your first paragraph seems to indicate that it would be much better for list(M) to return a list of entries, rather than a list of rows.  Is that correct?
