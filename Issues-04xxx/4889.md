list(M) and M.list() returning different lists is inconsistent. As discussed at http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/a7d8b439df769e7 we should have  M.entries() which replaces M.list() and deprecate the latter. 

The behavior of list(M) will remain the same, and consistency with M[i].

A reason to have m.list() return the entries is that m.dict() returns the entries, but in "sparse" dictionary format.

I was coding, and I realized that I very strongly object to this ticket -- or at least the nebulousness of it -- I can't even write the code i want the way I want since I know that it will just break for sure as soon as somebody closes this ticket :-(.  For me it is an incredibly important design pattern when working with matrices to turn the entire matrix into a list of its entries -- do something with them -- then use the resulting list to make another matrix. 

This is exactly modeled on Magma's `Eltseq` command, which turns almost anything in Magma into a linear sequence, and almost anything in Magma can be reconstructed from that sequence.  

Anyway, the list method is not just one off thing that doesn't matter -- it's central to matrices.  So either wontfix this ticket or do it asap to get the pain over with.

I do worry that changing this is changing things for change sake, and I'm not convinced that is a good idea...
