# Issue 4689: save method for graphics objects does not have an example explicitly using "save"

The examples in the documentation for the save method seems to be broken. If I try

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: Eplot=E.plot()
sage: Eplot.save?
```

then I get

``` 
EXAMPLES:
                sage: c = circle((1,1),1,rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
                sage: c.show(xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=3)

                To correct the apect ratio of certain graphics, it is necessary
                to show with a 'figsize' of square dimensions.

                sage: c.show(figsize=[5,5],xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=3)

                sage: point((-1,1),pointsize=30, rgbcolor=(1,0,0))
```

which never mentions "save" at all. Presumably there should be an extra line, something like

```
sage: c.save("example.png")
```

Hi,

which Sage release is that? If it is 3.2.1 this might be #4672. There is a patch over there that needs one doctest fix to be merged into 3.2.2.

Cheers,

Michael

----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: E=EllipticCurve([1,0])
sage: Eplot=E.plot()
sage: Eplot.save?
```
results in

Docstring:
    
            Save the graphics to an image file of type: PNG, PS, EPS, SVG, SOBJ,
            depending on the file extension you give the filename.
                Extension types can be: file{.png}, file{.ps}, file{.eps}, file{.svg},
                and file{.sobj} (for a SAGE object you can load later).

                sage: c.show(xmin=-1,xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=3)
