**Attachment:** [HISTORY.txt-3.1.3-3.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4619/HISTORY.txt-3.1.3-3.2.patch.gz)

The patch doesn't apply against a repo, but shows the changes added to HISTORY.txt by adding the release notes of 3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.2 as well as some minimal formatting.

Cheers,

Michael
