For consistency with symbolic expressions, callable symbolic expressions should accept keyword arguments.

```
sage: x, y = var('x,y')
sage: f = x^2 + y^2
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicArithmetic'>
sage: f(3,2)
13
sage: f(x=3,y=2)
13

The desired behavior is

sage: f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.CallableSymbolicExpression'>
sage: f(3,2)
13
sage: f(x=3, y=2)
13

But the current behavior is

sage: f(x=3, y=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'y'
```


Component: **calculus**
