John Cremona remarked at #4837:

for an absolute extension we can create an element from a polynomial over the base field, but not for a relative extension:

```
sage: K.<z>=CyclotomicField(7)
sage: Ky.<y>=PolynomialRing(K)
sage: L.<a>=K.extension(y^2+1)
sage: K(K.polynomial_ring().random_element())
z + 1
sage: L(L.polynomial_ring().random_element())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError           
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce 7/2*z^5 + 1/2*z^4 + z^3 - 37/2*z to a rational
```
