```
With high -tp numbers (i.e. 16) on sage.math one will see similar issues to the one below:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/libs/symmetrica/symmetrica.pyx
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.alpha0/tmp/.doctest_symmetrica.py", line 29
    >>> test_integer(Integer(1))###line 539:_sage_    >>> test_integer(1)
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

This is likely a race condition between creating the file and the actual running of the doctest. The issue is not specific to -tp. 

A potential solution might be to create all .doctest_$FOO files and then start running them. This might also fix the problem with 

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/symbolic/constants.pyx
 [0.1 s]
```
in Sage 3.2.1+ which is caused by no doctests being executed since (a) either there are no doctests in that file or (b) we are running optional doctests only.

Cheers,

Michael
