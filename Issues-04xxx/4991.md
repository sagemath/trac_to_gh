Running Sage under gdb is broken on OSX at the moment:

    text = pipe.read()
IOError: [Errno 4] Interrupted system call

Program exited with code 01.
```
The above problem is caused by the IPython import. The problem goes away if we disable the following libedit import test in rlineimpl.py

```
uses_libedit = False
if sys.platform == 'darwin' and have_readline:
    import commands
    (status, result) = commands.getstatusoutput( "otool -L %s | grep libedit" % _rl.__file__ )
    if status == 0 and len(result) > 0:
        # we are bound to libedit - new in Leopard
        _rl.parse_and_bind("bind ^I rl_complete")
        print "Leopard libedit detected."
        uses_libedit = True
```
This can be done without side effects since we link against the real readline. The issue has been reported to the IPython mailing list.

spkg is coming up.

Cheers,

Michael

That said, it gets farther and is running into a different error than before.  Also, the patch you did include looks good and is done right.

Please create another ticket though with the branch detection issue (just paste the above log).
