See #4848 for a motivation. Attached is some Magma code, but note that according to William

```
Then the file heegner.py should be attached to that ticket, since to do that 
ticket, one might want to port some of what's in there to Sage. That said, it's 
not so simple, since better algorithms for computing Heegner points were found 
after that code was written.

This is fixed by #6045. I'm flagging this to "positive review" so it will come to the attention of mvngu, who has the authority to close tickets as 4.1.1 release manager.
