It is on my TODO list (which is rather long) and which I started attacking since the end of my finals.

I don't have a recent version of Sage on my machine right now so it'll be a couple of days before I can rebase it.

If somebody else wants to do it in the meantime, that could help.

Great thanks to Arnaud's work here - especially labeling contours is a great thing to have now!
