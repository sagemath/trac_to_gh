**Attachment:** [trac_4861.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4861/trac_4861.patch.gz)

**Review**
* SPKG.txt is updated properly (+1)
* hg status returns cleanly (+1)
* doesn't seem to contain unneeded binary cruft (+1)
* attached patch `trac_4861.patch` looks good (+1)
* `spkg-install` works on sage.math (+1)
* `spkg-install` **runs test suite** (-1)
* `make ptest` passes on sage.math (+1)

"positive review" if the test suite is disabled or it is explained why it needs to be run.

Every time we have upgrades FLINT we automatically run the test suite. This is usually turned off once we do the actual release.

I know, we just need to stick a reminder somewhere, don't we? If you disagree, just change it to positive review since the worst thing that can happen is an extra couple of minutes of build time.

Hi Martin,

> I know, we just need to stick a reminder somewhere, don't we? If you disagree, just change it to positive review since the worst thing that can happen is an extra couple of minutes of build time.

#4870 is now a blocker for 3.2.3 to turn it off before release. I would imagine this is a solution we can both live with.

Cheers,
