A little problem:

```
Note that configuration files will be stored in the  
    directory \code{\$DOT\_SAGE/dsage}.
```
Is replaced now by

```
Note that configuration files will be stored in the directory 
``$DOT 
Sage/dsage``. 
``` 
the "_" must be kept. 

Otherwise this is correct. 

Cheers,

Florent
