The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0.spkg

fixes the issue:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/release-cycle/junk/sage-3.2.2$ export MAKE="make -j8"
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/release-cycle/junk/sage-3.2.2$ ./sage -i macaulay2-1.1-r7221.p0
<SNIP - things do not blow up>
```
