This is totally wrong!

```
sage: K.<j,b> = QQ[sqrt(-1), sqrt(2)]
sage: j.conjugate()
0
```

Much better would be either an error message (since the docs for conjugate say it isn't implemented except for cyclotomic and quadratic fields!) or an actual correct answer using a number field embedding.  But giving 0 is just crazy.
