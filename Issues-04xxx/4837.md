At the moment, if K is a number field then K.random_element() uses a generic implementation that simply returns a random *integer* coerced into K.  It would be useful to have a real implementation that returns an actual random element of K.

A simple idea would be to find a primitive element j that generates K as a field extension over QQ, and to return a random polynomial of degree at most [K:QQ].  This should be easy since random polynomials in one variable are already implemented.

Hi John,

Here's a third possibility: any field extension L/K is really a quotient K[x]/(f(x)), so we can start with a random element of K[x] and reduce it mod f(x).  Getting a random element of K[x] is easy if we can get random elements of K itself.  If L is an absolute number field, then K=QQ and we're in business; if L/K is a relative number field, then this will "descend" to K and so on until it hits QQ.

The advantage of this approach is that it is very transparent and easy to code.  Also in the relative situation there is no need to compute a primitive element, all we need are the splitting polynomials for each step in the tower, and those are just part of the given data.

I agree with the suggestion that we should be able to produce random algebraic integers as well.  But I think this should be implemented as a method random_element() of an order in a number field, rather than as a method of the number field itself.  And then your idea of using the ZZ-basis is really the only option I can think of.

I fully agree:  use the existing method for absolute fields (where there's essentially no need to find a primitive element), use the recursive method for relative extensions, and make a new ticket for random elements of orders (and fractional ideals while we're at it) which will use Z-bases.

Will you be adapting the current patch accordingly?

Alex, I just noticed that you can do this in one line with 

K(K.polynomial_ring().random_element(degree=K.degree()-1))

since K.polynomial_ring is *not* K[x] but is the polynomial ring over K's base field, whatever that is.  So this will automatically work ok recursively, given that the random_element() method for polynomial rings uses the random_element() method for the coefficient ring.

Following the discussion at
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/67b40b64970bbf19
I implemented coercion of elements from the isomorphic polynomial quotient ring to the number field.  As a consequence of this and the code for random elements of quotient rings at #4218, random_element() for number fields became a fairly trivial one-liner.

See the attached patch.  It is advisable to first merge the patch at #4218.

The patch applies fine (over 3.2.2 + #4218).  Just one thing:  for an absolute extension we can create an element from a polynomial over the base field, but not for a relative extension:

```
sage: K.<z>=CyclotomicField(7)
sage: Ky.<y>=PolynomialRing(K)
sage: L.<a>=K.extension(y^2+1)
sage: K(K.polynomial_ring().random_element())
z + 1
sage: L(L.polynomial_ring().random_element())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError           
...
TypeError: Unable to coerce 7/2*z^5 + 1/2*z^4 + z^3 - 37/2*z to a rational
```
I'm sure this will cause complaints before long, so can we make the new constructor slightly more flexible?  Of course if your replace `polynomial_ring()` with `polynomial_quotient_ring()` it works fine thanks to the new code.
