This patch adds missing doctests to ell_modular_symbols.py, ell_number_field.py and
ell_padic_field.py. The conversion to Pari in ell_padic_field.py was broken, and still
fails in some cases (see example in file), but I don't know if this is a bug in Pari, or
an invalid input.

I also removed some unused functions in ell_modular_symbols.py, it would be good to check they
are not needed elsewhere.

Note that some internal functions could not be tested, thus the coverage is not 100%.

```
bash-3.00$ sage -coverage ell_modular_symbols.py ell_number_field.py ell_padic_field.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ell_modular_symbols.py
SCORE ell_modular_symbols.py: 100% (6 of 6)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ell_number_field.py
SCORE ell_number_field.py: 90% (19 of 21)

Missing documentation:
         * _proot(x, e):
         * _pquadroots (a, b, c):

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ell_padic_field.py
SCORE ell_padic_field.py: 80% (4 of 5)

Missing documentation:
         * _frob(P):

John, my patch should apply to 3.1.2 (I always use the latest release).
In the meantime, I have worked on ell_point.py, I hope this will be no duplicate work,
I will submit it soon.

The 3rd patch (to be applied after the first 2) re-enable two methods that were unused in
ell_modular_symbols.py, but one was used elsewhere, and the other one might be useful.
