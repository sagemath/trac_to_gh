<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

The [new version](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4551/trac_4551-settings_page_v2.patch.gz), based on #6983's revision 72, #7110, and #7158, can display and update all server settings.

With some extra work, we can do the same for user settings, including custom key bindings, for example.

Feel free to suggest changes.  Potential "To do" list items:

* Use templates.
* Check for errors.
* "Reset to defaults" option.
* "Revert to earlier configuration" option.  This should be straightforward to implement, if we use a versioning system for the `.conf` files.
* Combine the `defaults` and `defaults_descriptions` dictionaries.
* Remove unused settings.
* Use a color picker for color settings.
* User settings, including key bindings, CSS, etc.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">comment:8</div>

Patch v3:

* Uses [Farbtastic](http://acko.net/dev/farbtastic) for color settings.
* Updates the `descriptions_defaults` dictionary.
* Adds a `T_LIST` type.
* Changes `'email'`'s type back to `T_BOOL`.

Remarks:

* It would be simpler (and more consistent?) to use `[]` instead of `None` for an empty `server_poll` setting.
* Install the more compact [jPicker](http://www.digitalmagicpro.com/jPicker/).  Use it for `interact`s, too?
