Hi, Emmanuel Thomé noted that
there is a speed/system call activity regression in between Sage 3.0.5 and 3.1.3.
If in Sage 3.1.3/3.1.4/3.2.alpha0 one issues something like

```
sage: time for i in range(10): float(1)/2
```
and looks at the same at the system call activity of this python "sage.bin" process (in another terminal with something like "strace -p 'pidof sage.bin' -e trace='stat'" under Linux, or using "sudo fs_usage 4711" under Mac OS X, 4711 being the sage.bin pid gotten e.g. via the activity tool), then one sees:

The (sage/python) sys.path is searched by the system call "stat" for "coerce.pyx", "coerce_maps.pyx", "parent.pyx" and "integer.pyx" many times, that whole path, and over and over again.

This does not happen under Sage 3.0.5.

Willem Jan Palenstijn proposed this code fragment, which triggers the behaviour in Sage 3.2.alpha0, too:

```
sage: cm=sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.canonical_coercion(float(1),1)
```
and noted that

"This seems to be the _record_exception() function in the coercion model."

(See also the recent sage_devel thread started by Emmanuel Thomé about this.)

<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

I know now how to change the code so that when we had before:

```
sage: time for i in range(10^4): float(1)/2
CPU times: user 17.72 s, sys: 13.44 s, total: 31.16 s
Wall time: 31.20 s
```
then after the changes we get:

```
sage: time for i in range(10^4): float(1)/2
CPU times: user 0.37 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.37 s
Wall time: 0.37 s
```
which is quite impressive, I think (the sys time is used up only by these insanely many calls to "stat")!

Essentially all one has to do is not to call "sys.exc_info()" in "_record_exception" (file: sage/structure/coerce.pyx) unless you really want to do so. But to fix that nicely (e.g. not leaving a broken doctest) will take me another evening or two.

Thanks for tracking this down. Just out of curiosity, how does one decide if one "really wants to." Ideally one could snapshot the traceback without touching every file involved.

BTW, using RDF rather than float will be 10x faster in this case even after your speedup.

sage: sage: time for i in range(10^4): RDF(1)/2
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.03 s

The point is that when something goes wrong, one wants to be able to ask "what happened" which is why these tracebacks are stored. Re-running the command may not give you all the information because of the caching involved. Is there a better way to get the traceback information than invoking sys.exc_info?

Oops,
I had cached this page in my browser so your point about caching completely went past me up to now.

Hmmmmmm.

My first feeling about this that whenever one gets a such failure, it is important to be able to reproduce it. If so, then this means you can "rerun" the code.
If not, then you are hunting some "sporadic" phantom.
In that case, one should have "enabled the exception stack" all the time.

But for everyday usage of Sage, it might be allowable to have this feature disabled, considering its costs.

Excellent!
And this is how solutions evolve:
1. primitive (just comment out the last line of _record_exception)
2. complicated (my patch)
3. simple (Robert's patch)

I have to go to work now, but I'll try hard to run and review the patch this evening.
(It looks perfect at first sight.)

Cheers,
gsw

Yep, this does the job.

Since I had trouble to get hg / mercurial queues to produce me another patch on top of Robert's original patch (telling me "abort: cannot commit over an applied mq patch" in the course), I just hacked that single line to be fixed in Robert's patch and loaded up the result.

(I'll find out how to do it correctly as soon as I did send this comment ...)

`@`Robert:

Please take care with this hacked patch and your personal hg repo, the hacked patch still contains your original hg Node ID / parent strings ...

Cheers, gsw
