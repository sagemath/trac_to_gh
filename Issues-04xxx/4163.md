That's a good point.

I would also include
sage: c.factor()
2^22 * 3^10 * 5^6 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23
(which would be helpful to people who might know know this meaning of
"valuation", standard in number theory), and even perhaps
sage: list(c.factor())
[(2, 22), (3, 10), (5, 6), (7, 3), (11, 2), (13, 1), (17, 1), (19, 1), (23, 1)]

Looks good to me. You did not add c.factor(), so I am not sure what to do in that regard.

John: Do you have a preference here?

Cheers,

i thought that it would be preferrable not to clutter the example too much, but i don't have strong feelings about this.  i can easily add that in if people think it's a good idea.
