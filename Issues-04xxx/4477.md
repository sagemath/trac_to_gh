The patch posted against this ticket enhances the exp() function for PowerSeriesRing elements and allows it to compute with valid non-zero constant terms in the power series.

Previously: f.exp() would return an error "Constant term must be zero" if f[0] != 0

With the patch: f.exp() checks if f[0].exp() is at all defined and in the case it is defined, whether f[0].exp() belongs to the base ring of f. If both the conditions are satisfied, f.exp() is returned.

Code is basically good. Still running doctests. A few comments:

* Indenting on "Check for non-zero constant term" line is wrong. Please fix.

* Shouldn't have "fixes \#4477" (what will that mean in two years)

* please refactor so that self.derivative().solve_linear_de(prec) is not called in two different places

* "if C.parent()!=self.base_ring()" should use "is not" instead of "!=" (much more efficient)

* possibly should use "if not self[0].is_zero()" instead of "if self[0]". I can't remember why, but maybe is_zero actually does something useful (I vaguely remember it might have something to do with testing zero-ness in inexact rings)

* the error message "exponential of the input does not belong to the ring" should be more useful to the user. Perhaps "exponential of the constant term does not lie in the coefficient ring. Consider coercing to an appropriate larger ring", or if you're feeling ambitious, invoke the coercion machinery to automagically find that larger ring (but don't ask me how to do that, I have no idea)

* I think that error message is also misleading in the case that the constant term doesn't have an exp method defined. Perhaps raise a different error in that case, e.g. "cannot exponentiate series; exp of constant term is not defined".

* The last doctest is misleading. The power series ring is defined over QQ, but the doctest *implicitly* creates a power series over RR and then exponentiates that. To demonstrate the different situation clearly, the doctest should explicitly create the power series ring over RR.

I disagree. Any doctest marked that way should never be changed since it fixes a specific bug and hence refers to the trac ticket. Tests like that should probably be moved to a TESTS section in the long term, but we can deal with that later.

The sqrt function automatically passes to the rationals.

I suppose it's reasonable to expect it automatically passes to the quotient field where possible, but unless someone wants to fix that right now, it should probably go onto another ticket.
