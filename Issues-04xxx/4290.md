This is a function to turn plane curves of genus 1 with a known point into objects of type EllipticCurve. It relies on MAGMA (as does EllipticCurve_from_cubic) but will add a little functionality. Here is an example of how it works:

```
sage: x,y,z=MPolynomialRing(QQ,Integer(3),'xyz').gens() # optional
sage: C=Curve(x^4+x^2*y^2-z^4) 
sage: P=C(1,0,1) 
sage: E=EllipticCurve_from_plane_curve(C,P) 
sage: E 
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + 4*x over Rational Field
```

The "patch" isn't a patch, it's just a function defined in Sage. Secondly, there is already a function that does almost the same as this in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/constructor.py .

So what needs to be done (Lloyd!) is to (1) Explain briefly how this function differs from the existing one, and why it is better, and also (2) actually make a patch.

If Lloyd convinces me of  (1) then I'll happily do (2).

I have made a proper patch based on Lloyd's function (based on 3.4.1.rc0), which also fixes his function so that it works when the variable names are something other than 'x','y','z' (which it did not before).

You might think that this function makes the existing EllipicCurve_from_cubic redundant;  it nearly does, but that function takes a homogeneous polynomial while this one takes an actual curve.  It would probably be better to combine these when all this is rewritten in Sage.

I added the new function to all.py so that it is in the global namespace.  I am not sure what the convention is here, given that it is an optional-only function requiring magma!  Also I have nto tested my patch o na machine without magma since I don't have one handy :)

The doctests should be marked:

```
   # optional - magma
```
so when one does

```
  sage -t -only_optional=magma
```
they get run.
