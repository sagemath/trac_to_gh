This is a function to turn plane curves of genus 1 with a known point into objects of type EllipticCurve. It relies on MAGMA (as does EllipticCurve_from_cubic) but will add a little functionality. Here is an example of how it works:

```
sage: x,y,z=MPolynomialRing(QQ,Integer(3),'xyz').gens() # optional
sage: C=Curve(x^4+x^2*y^2-z^4) 
sage: P=C(1,0,1) 
sage: E=EllipticCurve_from_plane_curve(C,P) 
sage: E 
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + 4*x over Rational Field
```

The "patch" isn't a patch, it's just a function defined in Sage. Secondly, there is already a function that does almost the same as this in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/constructor.py .

So what needs to be done (Lloyd!) is to (1) Explain briefly how this function differs from the existing one, and why it is better, and also (2) actually make a patch.

If Lloyd convinces me of  (1) then I'll happily do (2).

The doctests should be marked:

```
   # optional - magma
```
so when one does

```
  sage -t -only_optional=magma
```
they get run.
