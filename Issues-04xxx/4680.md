The matplotlib install on OSX can find the system-wide files, leading to problems like this:

```
sage: from matplotlib import _png
ImportError: dlopen(/sage/local/lib/python/site-packages/matplotlib/_png.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
      Referenced from: /sage/local/lib/python/site-packages/matplotlib/_png.so
      Reason: Incompatible library version: _png.so requires version 27.0.0 or later, but libpng12.0.dylib provides version 23.0.0
```

The matplotlib config tries to look all over for libpng, but we only want it to find the sage specific one. The attached diff of `setupext.py` in `matplotlib-0.98.3.p3/patches/` tells it not to.
