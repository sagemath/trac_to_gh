So we currently use several Python/C API calls to speed up the `__getitem__` method in `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx`. In particular, we do several typechecks against standard Python types, and replacing generic `PY_TYPE_CHECK` calls with specific Python/C API calls (like `PySlice_Check`) provides a significant speedup. Once Cython can do all these things for us, we should clean up `__getitem__` so that it's more readable/portable. 

Alternatively, if such functionality still doesn't exist in Cython, one should feel free to go, implement that functionality, get it merged, create a new Cython spkg, and then make these changes. `:)`
