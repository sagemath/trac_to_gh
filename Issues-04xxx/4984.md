So we currently use several Python/C API calls to speed up the `__getitem__` method in `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx`.

Alternatively, if such functionality still doesn't exist in Cython, one should feel free to go, implement that functionality, get it merged, create a new Cython spkg, and then make these changes. `:)`
