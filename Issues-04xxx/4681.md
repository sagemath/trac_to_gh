Smith form is a useful canonical form for matrices over a PID. Sage already has it for ZZ. I've coded up a very basic implementation that should work over any PID Sage knows about (although it is not fast).

**Note**: This ticket should also fix #3068

I read the code, which looks fine.  The doctests pass.  This test passes:

```
for i in range(10):
   print i
   a = random_matrix(ZZ[sqrt(-1)],7)
   d,u,v = a.smith_form()
   assert u*a*v == d
   assert u.det() == 1
   assert v.det() == 1
```

This fails pretty quickly, but it's not the fault of this code:

```
K.<a>=NumberField(x^3-2)
print "h = ", K.class_number()
for i in range(10):
   print i
   a = random_matrix(K,3)
   d,u,v = a.smith_form()
   assert u*a*v == d
   assert u.det() == 1
   assert v.det() == 1
...

Traceback (most recent call last):       d,u,v = a.smith_form()

  File "element.pyx", line 1269, in sage.structure.element.CommutativeRingElement.inverse_mod (sage/structure/element.c:10039)
NotImplementedError
```

It's the fault of other stuff missing in Sage.

Another thing -- in matrices over ZZ there is a smith_form function, and it's inputs, etc., are *not* consistent with the above.  It doesn't have a transformation option - instead it always gives the transformation matrices.  However, it also says to use the function "elementary_divisors" to get the diagonal entries.   I attached a patch that fixes this by making the sage integer matrix snf have the same interface as the generic one. 

The definition of smith_form between your new code and Sage's code (which relies on pari) is inconsistent (see below).  This needs to be somehow resolved.  I haven't done this yet at all.

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ,3,[1..9]); a

[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
sage: a.smith_form()

([0 0 0]
[0 3 0]
[0 0 1],
 [ 1 -2  1]
[ 0 -1  1]
[ 0  2 -1],
 [ 1  2 -1]
[-2 -1  1]
[ 1  0  0])
sage: a.smith_form(transformation=False)

[0 0 0]
[0 3 0]
[0 0 1]
sage: a = matrix(ZZ[i],3,[1..9]); a

[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
[7 8 9]
sage: a.smith_form(transformation=False)

[ 1  0  0]
[ 0 -3  0]
[ 0  0  0]
```

To get this into Sage, please:
* review my matrix_integer_dense patch
* decide on what to do about the inconsistency between sage/pari/your code.

Hmm. On reflection, perhaps the way the Sage code was already doing it is the right way: smith_form should always return the transformation matrix, and elementary_divisors should be provided separately.

This seems more logical to me, because one can define analogues of elementary divisors over any Dedekind domain, but the result is a list of ideals rather than of elements and thus there is no analogue of the transformation matrix. PARI/GP has a function that does this over rings of integers of a general number field. Also, even over ZZ where the transformation matrices do make sense there are some fast algorithms for elementary divisors that don't give them.

As for the inconsistency of ordering the results, I've called for a quick straw poll on sage-devel.

The other issue is one of sign. Conventionally elementary divisors are always *nonnegative* integers; one wouldn't want to calculate the invariants of a finitely generated abelian group and be told that it had a direct summand that was cyclic of order -5. But for general PID's there's no canonical choice of sign for the generator of an ideal. I'm sure nobody will actually be all that bothered by this, but I will drop the insistence that U and V have det 1 and replace it with the insistence that the d_i are >= 0, even though this is pretty meaningless.

Incidentally, I just realised the doctests don't pass! I added an is_noetherian method for number field orders, but didn't notice that there is a doctest in sage/rings/ring.pyx that is actually broken by this -- it creates an order, calls is_noetherian() on it and insists that the result should be NotImplementedError. I will fix this.

Attachment: **[4681-smithform-consistent.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4681/4681-smithform-consistent.patch.gz)**

(cc'ed to ncalexan as symplectic_basis is his territory)

Nobody's objected violently to the change yet on sage-devel, so the following patch changes SNF over ZZ, to put 1's first and 0's last. (Also, when M is non-square it puts the nonzero entries in the [i,i] diagonal, not on some shifted diagonal ending in the bottom corner like the previous code did -- I found that rather inconvenient.)

As I suggested above, I've changed the call syntax over a general ring to be consistent with the existing code over ZZ, so I got rid of the "transformation=True" argument and added an extra function "elementary_divisors" which returns the diagonal entries of M. This can be overridden later, if anyone feels like implementing a fast algorithm for elementary divisors for more general rings.

I've also fixed up "symplectic_basis" to be consistent with the new "smith_form"; it doesn't explicitly use smith_form, but the conventions for the output are chosen for consistency with smith_form, so I've changed them in tandem. (ncalexan: is this OK with you?)

I didn't actually make it choose ideal representatives that compare as >= 0 -- I decided I couldn't bear to fix such a horrible convention. This means that if R is a general PID, coercing integer matrices from ZZ to R doesn't quite commute with Smith form, but I don't see why one should expect it to.

If I apply 4681-smithform-consistent.patch and then 4681-docstringfix.patch, everything works on sage.math but not on my home machine -- there is no inverse_mod for the maximal order elements in question.  Can you clarify?  Do I need some other patches from other tickets?
