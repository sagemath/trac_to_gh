The main bug is that the devel/doc directory isn't copied into the bdist.  This is because of a stupid bug in local/bin/sage-bdist, which is fixed by the attached 1-line patch. 

To test this, apply the patch, do "./sage -bdist" then look in the SAGE_ROOT/dist directory and confirm that the resulting binary has a devel/doc directory.

Attachment [scripts-4516.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4516/scripts-4516.patch) by GeorgSWeber created at 2008-11-14 22:39:43

By chance, I had experimented with "sage -bdist" on Sage 3.2.alpha2, so I could verify that indeed, without this patch the "devel/doc-main" directory is missing.

With this patch applied, it is there after "sage-bdist".
