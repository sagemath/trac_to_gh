I could create a polybori-0.5rc.p5.spkg that builds on an Intel PowerBook with OS X 10.4 / Xcode 2.4.1, after noticing that the build error is related to enhance dynamic libs with version information.
But all dynamic libs are eliminated for Sage 3.1.2 anyway, so we don't have to care.

Unfortunately, I have no acquaintance with neither hg nor patch and friends.

Fortunately, all one has to do is uncomment two lines around line # 432 in the file

.../spkg/standard/polybori-0.5rc.p5/patches/SConstruct

which read originally:

#if env['PLATFORM']=="darwin":
\#    slib=env.LoadableModule


and which I patched to give the four lines:

#uncommented for OS X 10.4 / Xcode 2.4.1
if env['PLATFORM']=="darwin":
    slib=env.LoadableModule
#end of modification for OS X 10.4 / Xcode 2.4.1


(The build of the Sage core didn't finish yet, but I have to sleep now.)

Oops.
Strange formatting, I see why you need patch files and the like.
Just do a search for "slib" in that file, it is then obvious which two consecutive lines to uncomment.

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc2/polybori-0.5rc.p5.spkg

implements the fix Georg suggested and adds a bunch of explanation why we are disabling the option.

Builds fine on OSX 10.4 and 10.5.

Cheers,

Michael
