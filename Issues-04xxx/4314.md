The attached patch (based on 3.1.4) makes two changes in libs/cremona/mat*:
1. Adds getitem methods to the matric class so i,j entries may be extracted;
2. Changes the conversion to sage of matrices so that matrices over ZZ are constructed instead of ZZ.

These were done as part of a hands-on tutorial William gave to John in Bordeaux.
