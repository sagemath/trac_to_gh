It would be nice to be able to do indefinite integration of piecewise functions in Sage.

I've created a patch which does this. I have made the default behavior of the integral() function of a piecewise function be to return the indefinite integral, and the definite integral is returned only when definite=True is supplied.

```
sage: pw = Piecewise([[(0,1), x*2], [(1,2), x + 3]])
sage: pw.integral()
Piecewise defined function with 2 parts, [[(0, 1), x^2], [(1, 2), (x^2 + 6*x)/2 - 5/2]]
sage: pw.integral(definite=True)
11/2
```

I made integration the default for consistency with other functions. For example,

```
sage: f(x)=3
sage: f.integral()
x |--> 3*x
sage: (x*8).integral()
4*x^2
sage: sin(x).integral()
-cos(x)
```

When integrating a piecewise function in Maple, the result is the indefinite integral. The only difference between the Maple result and the patched Sage code is that Maple defines the integral outside the bounds of the original piecewise function, which my code does not.

Hi Paul,

design discussions like this should not be done in trac since the number of people actually getting emails from this is minuscule compared to the audience on sage-devel. So please send an email with a summary what is proposed and what has been discussed so far to sage-devel. Also mention the ticket and that there are some more details there.

Thanks and keep up the good work.

Cheers,

Michael

There was a long thread in sage-devel which I though settled some design issues. One of them was that the FTC should be true for this indefinite integral. For example, the indef int F of the function f defined on (-4,3) \n\n```\n\n sage: f1(y) = -1\n sage: f2(y) = y + 3\n sage: f3(y) = -y - 1\n sage: f4(y) = y^2 - 1\n sage: f5(y) = 3\n sage: f = Piecewise([[(-4,-3),f1],[(-3,-2),f2],[(-2,0),f3],[(0,2),f4],[(2,3),f5]])\n sage: F = f.integral(y)\n\n```\n\nshould have the property that F(3)-F(-4) is the area under the curve.\nThis *is* true, as the following shows:\n\n```\nsage: f.integral(y,(-4,3))\n19/6\nsage: F(3)-F(-4)\n19/6\n```\n\nThis is not tested. In my option, this needs to be added to the docstring.\n\n*However*, what the docstring says is \"If definite=True is given, returns the definite integral.\"\nI don't know what the output\n\n```\nsage: f.integral(definite=True)\n2*(y^2 - 1) + y + 2*(-y - 1) + 5\n```\n\nmeans. I would expect it to be 19/6. Don't you assume the function is 0 outside \n(-4,3)? In any case, the definite integral seems incorrect, and is not consistenet\nwith the old behaviour, as you said it would be in the thread referred to above.",

Sorry, I didn't see this earlier or I would've reviewed it.

This does not seem to work as advertised. There was a long thread in sage-devel which I though settled some design issues. One of them was that the FTC should be true for this indefinite integral. For example, the indef int F of the function f defined on (-4,3) 

```

 sage: f1(y) = -1
 sage: f2(y) = y + 3
 sage: f3(y) = -y - 1
 sage: f4(y) = y^2 - 1
 sage: f5(y) = 3
 sage: f = Piecewise([[(-4,-3),f1],[(-3,-2),f2],[(-2,0),f3],[(0,2),f4],[(2,3),f5]])
 sage: F = f.integral(y)

```

should have the property that F(3)-F(-4) is the area under the curve.
This *is* true, as the following shows:

```
sage: f.integral(y,(-4,3))
19/6
sage: F(3)-F(-4)
19/6
```

This is not tested. In my option, this needs to be added to the docstring.

*However*, what the docstring says is "If definite=True is given, returns the definite integral."
I don't know what the output

```
sage: f.integral(definite=True)
2*(y^2 - 1) + y + 2*(-y - 1) + 5
```

means. I would expect it to be 19/6. Don't you assume the function is 0 outside 
(-4,3)? In any case, the definite integral seems incorrect, and is not consistenet
with the old behaviour, as you said it would be in the thread referred to above.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

The last two patches together (first patch #3 then the "default" patch) apply cleanly to 3.3.alpha2. They also pass sage -t.

A few comments:

1) You have 

```
            sage: f1(y) = (x+3)^2
            sage: f2(y) = x+3
            sage: f3(y) = 3
            sage: f = Piecewise([[(-infinity, -3), f1], [(-3, 0), f2], [(0, infinity), f3]])
            sage: f.integral()
            Piecewise defined function with 3 parts, [[(-Infinity, -3), (x^3 + 9*x^2 + 27*x)/3 + 9],
            [(-3, 0), (x^2 + 6*x)/2 + 9/2], [(0, +Infinity), 3*x + 9/2]]
```
in the docstring. Is this mixing of x's and y's intended or a typo? If intended, why?

2) I would have perferred that you add yourself to the AUTHR field at the top and add 

```
AUTHOR:
  P Butler
```
in the docstring of the function itself. Not crutial, but it will help others in the future know which part is whose.

3) You have the comment:


```
            # if this piece starts at negative infinity, we won't
            # try to compute the definite integral of the piece.
```
yet you have the definite integral

```

            sage: f1(x) = e^(-abs(x))
            sage: f = Piecewise([[(-infinity, infinity), f1]])
            sage: f.integral(definite=True)
            2
```
Could you explain this please? I think maybe you meant to say 
"...try to compute the indefinite...":

```
sage: f.integral()
Piecewise defined function with 1 parts, [[(-Infinity, +Infinity), -integrate(e^(-abs(x)), x, x, +Infinity)]]
```
If so, could you add this example and comment to the docstring please?


If you agree to all this, could you just make a small patch to go on top of the previous 2 so I can just apply it in my clone, run sage -t, and give this a positive review?

Attachment: **[piecewise_all_patches.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4721/piecewise_all_patches.patch.gz)**

Ok, I've added the patches.

`piecewise_all_patches.patch` fixes the problem in `calculus/wester.py` and *replaces all previous patches* that are part of this ticket.

`const_doctest.patch` fixes the problem in `doc/const/const.tex`.

Two strange things:

(1) For some reason, I cannot apply the const patch to 3.3.alpha2. However, the diff looks good to me.

(2) I applied the "all" patch. This is what I got (intel macbook running 10.4):

```
...
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maple.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/octave.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/toy_d_basis.py"
```

*However*, I know const.tex fails (see Michael's comment above), so I ran sage -testall and waited for the doctests to finish (which is near the beginning of the process). Sure enough,

```
Testing Sage constructions guide
sage -t  "devel/doc/const/const.tex"                        
**********************************************************************
File "/Volumes/G-DRIVE-MINI/sagestuff/sage-3.3.alpha2/devel/doc/const/const.tex", line 525:
    : f.integral()
Expected:
    3
Got:
    Piecewise defined function with 2 parts, [[(0, 1), x^3/3], [(1, 2), (15*x - x^3)/3 - 13/3]]
**********************************************************************
```
So I think sage -testall is not reporting all the failures on my machine for some reason.

In any case, I would gives this a positive review if I knew it would pass sage -testall. However, it isn't clear to me if the output of sage -testall after this patch is "positive enough" to make a "positive review" appropriate. Any suggestions Michael?

```
./sage -testall

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/qqbar.py"

Please see /home/paul/sage/tmp/test.log for the complete log from this test.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 27.4 seconds

From the log:

```

So it was just a timeout, not a bad value. Is there a way to disable or extend timeouts?
