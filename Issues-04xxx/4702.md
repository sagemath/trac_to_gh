REFEREE REPORT:

All the code looks good.  I doctested the whole tree and there are several doctests failures in free_module.py, but no other doctest failures.  

Nick, could you "explain" this behavior

```
sage: a = RR(pi)
sage: a
3.14159265358979
sage: magma(a)
3.14159265358979
sage: a = RR(pi)
sage: b = magma(a)
sage: b
3.14159265358979
sage: b.Parent()
Real field of precision 15
sage: b._sage_()
3.1415926535898
sage: b._sage_().parent()
Real Field with 49 bits of precision
```
I.e., why precision is lost in going back and forth.  Technically, it's not a priori necessary to loose bits, is it? 

Another remark -- the MagmaElement objects all have a sage method, so you can do

```
sage: b.sage()
```
instead of `b._sage_()` in doctests, which likely sets a better example.

This is a superb patch.  I read carefully through the rest and I'm happy with
everything.  I just want a short discussion about precision issues (going back and forth) and strategies, and fixing of the free_module.py doctests.

By the way, Sage numbers I think don't print all their decimal digits by default.  This a feature that Carl Witty added about a year ago, and may be responsible for the precision loss going back and forth.

I wasn't testing free_module.py correctly, so that's fixed.

I have made sure we lose no precision in the rings.  I talked to Carl Witty about truncating; we shouldn't do it, but Magma seems to do it anyway:

```
sage: a = 61/3.0; a
20.3333333333333
sage: a.str(truncate=False)
'20.333333333333332'
sage: magma(a).sage()
20.3333333333333
sage: magma(a).sage().str(truncate=False)
'20.333333333333300'
sage: magma('RealField(53 : Bits := true)!20.333333333333332')
20.3333333333333
sage: magma('RealField(53 : Bits := true)!20.333333333333332').sage().str(truncate=False)
'20.333333333333300'
sage: magma('RealField(53 : Bits := true)!20.333333333333332').Sage()
RealField(53)(20.3333333333333)
```

It's coming back from Magma truncated, and I have no idea how to make Magma print it without truncation.  I say we leave it as is -- losing a bit or three at the end is not a huge concern for me.
