During SD10 in Nancy, Michael Brickenstein and Burcin Erocal worked on making Plural (the non-commutative extension of Singular) accessible from Sage. Burcin and Michael also worked at the Plural wrapper on SD 23.5 in Kaiserslautern. Oleksandr Motsak and Alexander Dreyer continued this at SD 24 in Linz.

The patches that resulted from this work are attached.

Newest functionality:

* non-commutative rings/polynomials/ideals are fully featured classes now (no deriving from commutative ones)!
* coercion from basering/Integer types (still needs tests)
* flag to check degeneracy conditions on init
* relations for non-commutative rings
* most relevant functions for rings/polynomials/ideals (mostly adopted from MPolynomialRing_libsingular/MPolynomialRing_libsingular/...) e.g. std/twostd/syzygy_module/lc/lm/lt/monomial operations
* RingWrap and TermOrder were extended
* quick and dirty conversion of RingWrap to Sage rings (needs some care as the resulting rings may not be unique and therefore may confuse coercion)
* quotient of a non-commutative ring by a two-sided Groebner basis
* shortcut to create graded commutative algebras: SCA

Possible topics that need work are:

* put the files in sage/algebra/ ???
* make sure element does not export functions it doesn't support (e.g. gcd)
* predefined structures from the library

**__Apply__**

Burcin and Michael also worked at the Plural wrapper on SD 23.5 in Kaiserslautern. Oleksandr Motsak and Alexander Dreyer continued this at SD 24 in Linz.
 
 The patches that resulted from this work are attached.

Hi!

I have some computations to do with Weyl algebras, and would love to have this cool piece of work at my fingertips! Please keep it up!

For the record: I tried to apply those patches to Sage 4.5.2, and got the following rejects:

Same problem with the example taken from the documentation:

Is it possible at this stage to define non commutative polynomial rings over QQ['q'].fraction_field()?
I got an error with what I tried:

```

q = K.gen()

I started playing with ideals. Currently, one creates an ideal I, and
then when one calls I.std() or I.twostd() to create a new left or
twosided ideal, and actually compute the Groebner basis. What about
the following variants:

(A) Take the side decision at the time the ideal is created:

```
    sage: I = W.ideal([...], side=...)
```
(to be documented in ``W.ideal?``).

With that, ``I`` would be well defined as an ideal; otherwise it is
more a ``collection of polynomials'' and the name is misleading.

(B) About computing the Grobner basis:

```
    sage: I.groebner_basis()
```

or:

```
    sage: I.std() 
```
would compute the groebner basis, store it for later calculations, and
return it as a list of polynomials rather than a new ideal.

I haven't actually played with ideals in Sage; so maybe point (B) is
just how things are with commutative ideals in Sage, and consistency
should take precedence.

Cheers,
                    Nicolas

+1 for the implementation proposal!

I also like that shorthand syntax for interactive usage. However, in
code, I prefer using something more explicit like R.ideal(L,side=...).
Besides, having an R.ideal method also provides with:

- a good place for advertising (it appears in R.<tab>), documenting,
  testing the feature and its shorthand
- an easy way for subclasses of (the class of) R to override this
  method without having to worry about overloading/coercion/...

The reason of the error was that `FreeModule` tries (among other things) the method `is_integral_domain()`. By default, it raises a `NotImplementedError`, and this is the error we get above.

Proposed solution: Catch that `NotImplementedError` and do as if `is_integral_domain()` had returned `False`.

I don't know if there will be further problems, but I'll put it back to "needs review".

It would be great to have this in Sage!

I'm seeing some problems with the patch.  First, it doesn't apply cleanly to Sage 4.7.alpha1.  I haven't tried applying to 4.6.2.  I rebased it by hand.

Second, the change

```diff
-                    block_name, block_length, _ = re.split(length_pattern,block)
+                    block_name, block_length, _ = re.split(pattern, block.strip())
```
in term_order.py is problematic, because "pattern" is not defined anywhere.  Replacing it by "length_pattern" seems to work.

Third, in multipolynomial_ideal.py, `_groebner_basis_libsingular` is being called with keywords "deg_bound" and "mult_bound", but it doesn't accept those keywords as valid arguments.  Should we add `*args, **kwds` to the argument list?    Or should those keywords be dealt with explicitly?  I tried adding generic `*args` and `**kwds`, but doctesting on that file segfaults.

When I doctest the whole Sage library after making these changes, I get the following failures:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # Killed/crashed
        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx # 1 doctests failed

        sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx # 6 doctests failed
```
On one machine, I also had this failure:

```
	sage -t -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial.pyx # Killed/crashed
```

We were just dubling the work, it seems. I had rebased my old patch and was running tests (don't know the outcome).

But is your patch relative to #11068 (and perhaps to #7797 as well)? #11068 already has a positive review, and since it adds one- and twosided ideals of non-commutative rings, it seems like a natural dependency for a plural wrapper.

I have attached my experimental rebasement (relative to #7797 on top of sage-4.7.2.alpha3), but not all is good.

There are quite a lot of doctest failures, including some very wrong arithmetical results in plural.pyx.

Less dramatic: There are some zero division errors (for example in doctests of mul
ti_polynomial_libsingular.pyx) where the expected error message was "rational division by zero", but now there is *no* error message (but there is a `ZeroDivisionError`, at least).

There is a segment fault in the tests of multi_polynomial_ideal.py. I guess it is the same segfault that also occurs in some elliptic curves tests.

I am now testing Alexander's patch. First good news: It applies without fuzz, even when #7797 is applied. Let's see how the doc tests work!

I started with "manually" testing against three of the doc test errors that I got with my patch. Two of them fail with Alexander's patch as well:

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: x/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError:
```
 --> The old error message "rational division by zero" has gone.

```
sage: (x*y).is_monomial()
True
sage: (2*y).is_monomial()
False
```
 --> That's better than my patch, where these return 1 and 0.

```
sage: (x+y^2^30)^10
x^10
```
 --> That should result in an overflow error.

I didn't analyse the segmentation faults.

> ZeroDivisionError:

Here is the explanation:

Let `P = QQ[x,y,z]`. Since coercion is now done properly, x/0 is first converting 0 into P and tries to invert it there. The result is a naked `ZeroDivisionError` in
sage.libs.singular.polynomial.singular_polynomial_div_coeff.
Before, it used to invert 0 as a rational number, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError` with some error message.

Burcin and I agree that it is ok to have the `ZeroDivisionError` without a message: What else could it state but "don't divide by zero"?

So, it is not an issue.

> ```
> sage: (x*y).is_monomial()
> True
> sage: (2*y).is_monomial()
> False
> ```

I don't know why it has occured in the first place, but now it seems alright, even with my patch.

> ```
> sage: (x+y^2^30)^10
> x^10
> ```
>  --> That should result in an overflow error.

It turns out that one gets the *same* stupid result with an unpatched sage-4.7.2.alpha2. Burcin told me that this patch is supposed to fix it. Apparently it fails, and we need to understand why it fails.

> I didn't analyse the segmentation faults.

Tests are still missing, of course, and I have still no idea about the segfault.

I can already confirm that ther *is* a segfault without the lmul patch. So, I'll try to analyse what arguments are passed to `_rmul_` / _lmul_. If I remember correctly, polynomial rings do not use the current coercion model. Hence, it is perhaps no surprise that `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` do not do what we expect.

Alexander, how did you found that a change in lmul could fix it?

I get a doctest failure in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py. There, a protocol of a Gröbner basis computation is printed where we do not expect it.

The problem: If one runs the test separately, it works fine:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: H.inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: I = H.ideal([y^2, x^2, z^2-H.one_element()],coerce=False)
sage: G = vector(I.gens()); G

(y^2, x^2, z^2 - 1)
```

But the same doctest executed as part of the doctest suite has a 

```

[4294967295:2]3ss4s6
(S:2)--

```
printed after (!!) the result.

So, apparently another test has a side effect. I tried to identify it (e.g., a test that sets verbosity and forgets to reset it), but I did not succeed.  Also I wonder why one first sees the result and only later sees the protocol.

"By default is assumed, that two variables commute." I don't understand that statement. Is it meant "If there are only two variables then they commute"?

PS: The other statements

```
        - Coercion doesn't work yet, there is some cheating about assumptions
        - The optional argument ``check`` controls checking the degeneracy conditions.
          Furthermore, the default values interfere with non-degeneracy conditions.
```
aren't clear to  me either. 

* What does "cheating about assumptions" mean (what are the assumptions)?
* What exactly does not work in coercion (perhaps I can fix it?)?
* What are "the default values" (the only default is `order="degrevlex"`)?
* How do they interfere with non-degeneracy conditions? What are these conditions?

<div id="comment:74" align="right">comment:74</div>

Here's a report on features that I implemented today (not posted yet), missing features, and I also have some questions for you:

__Sidedness of ideals__

By #11068, we can have one- and two-sided ideals. Oleksander told me that Singular can only compute left or twosided Gröbner bases. Therefore, I think non-commutative polynomial ideals should refuse to be right-sided. The default should be left ideal. If the ideal is defined as a two-sided ideal, then std should return the same as twostd. Here is an example:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: H.inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: JL = H.ideal([x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z])
sage: JL
Left Ideal (x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: JL.std()
Left Ideal (z^3 - 4*z, y*z^2 - 2*y*z, x*z^2 + 2*x*z, 2*x*y*z - z^2 - 2*z, y^3, x^3) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: JT = H.ideal([x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z], side='twosided')
sage: JT
Twosided Ideal (x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: JT.std()
Twosided Ideal (z^3 - 4*z, y*z^2 - 2*y*z, x*z^2 + 2*x*z, y^2*z - 2*y^2, 2*x*y*z - z^2 - 2*z, x^2*z + 2*x^2, y^3, x*y^2 - y*z, x^2*y - x*z - 2*x, x^3) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: JT.std() == JL.twostd()
True
```

I think that's a good solution.

__Cache__

I added a cached_method decorator to std and twostd - I guess it is obvious that the result of a GB computation should be cached.

**Question:** Should g-algebras be unique parents? If you agree that they should be, then I can try to implement it.

__Category__

A proper initialisation of non-commutative polynomial rings in the category of algebras was missing and is now added:

```
sage: H._is_category_initialized()
True
sage: H.category()
Category of algebras over Rational Field
```

__Pickling__

The test suite does not pass. Among other things, pickling of g-algebras has simply been forgotten. This certainly must be fixed:

```
sage: dumps(H)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, NoneType found
```
It could be that, by using a `UniqueFactory` or `UniqueRepresentation`, the pickling problem automatically vanishes. Otherwise, a `__reduce__` method must be implemented.

__Generator names for g-algebras__

It should be possible to choose names in the `g_algebra()` method.

__Quotients__

There is a custom `quotient()` method for g-algebras (not using #11068). The question is: Is that really a quotient? It isn't printed as such, and the quotient relations are not used in arithmetic nor in comparison:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: H.inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: I = H.ideal([y^2, x^2, z^2-H.one_element()],coerce=False)
sage: Q = H.quotient(I); Q
Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: Q.relations()
{y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: I.twostd()
Twosided Ideal (z^2 - 1, y*z - y, x*z + x, y^2, 2*x*y - z - 1, x^2) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: Q.2^2
z^2
sage: Q.2^2 == Q.one_element()
False
```
**Question:** Did I misinterprete it? Hence, is there a way to make Q show that `Q.2^2` is equal to one?

Otherwise, the custom `quotient()` should be dropped. #11068 provides the framework for nc-quotient rings; one just needs to add a `I.reduce(p)` method to our ideals (which is missing anyway).

__Doc strings__

I fixed various wrong doc string formats. Of course, after the changes mentioned above, some doc tests need to be modified.

The patch that I have just attached provides uniqueness of the parent (using a `UniqueFactory`) and pickling for nc rings and polynomials.

In short:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: H is loads(dumps(H))
True
sage: TestSuite(H).run()
```

Doc tests still need to be updated, though. I also think that normal form computation should be easy to implement.

I have updated the second patch (adding a commit message), and I added a third patch. It provides a non-commutative "Gröbner strategy", normal form computation, and thus quotient rings of g-algebras.

Note that the quotients use the general framework from #11068. They *should* simply be g-algebras as well. But I suggest that this will be done on a different ticket.

With the new patch, one can do:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H.<x,y,z> = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: I = H.ideal([y^2, x^2, z^2-H.one_element()],coerce=False, side='twosided')
sage: Q = H.quotient(I); Q
Quotient of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z
over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y,
z*x: x*z + 2*x} by the ideal (y^2, x^2, z^2 - 1)
sage: Q.2^2 == Q.one_element()   # indirect doctest
True
```
Here, we see that the relation that we just found in the quotient is actually a consequence of the given relations:

```
sage: I.twostd()
Twosided Ideal (z^2 - 1, y*z - y, x*z + x, y^2, 2*x*y - z - 1, x^2)
of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over
Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
```

Note that reduction of polynomials by a list of polynomials is, in general, not a normal form. However, reduction of a polynomial by an ideal uses a two-sided Gröbner basis and is thus a normal form.

I just thought that it would better be reduction by a left Gröbner basis, if the ideal is just a left ideal. OK, doing it soon...

The third patch is now modified, so that reduction wrt a left ideal is computed with a left (not a two-sided) Gröbner basis.

It needs work, since the documentation is not complete and since certainly several doc tests need to be modified. But feel free to test the new patches...

Sorry, I couldn't resist to add one more feature: Ideal containment, which is a direct application of normal form computation.

With the new version of the third patch, we have:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: H.<x,y,z> = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
sage: JL = H.ideal([x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z])
sage: JL.std()
Left Ideal (z^3 - 4*z, y*z^2 - 2*y*z, x*z^2 + 2*x*z, 2*x*y*z - z^2 - 2*z, y^3, x^3) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
sage: JT = H.ideal([x^3, y^3, z^3 - 4*z], side='twosided')
sage: JT.std()
Twosided Ideal (z^3 - 4*z, y*z^2 - 2*y*z, x*z^2 + 2*x*z, y^2*z - 2*y^2, 2*x*y*z - z^2 - 2*z, x^2*z + 2*x^2, y^3, x*y^2 - y*z, x^2*y - x*z - 2*x, x^3) of Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field, nc-relations: {y*x: x*y - z, z*y: y*z - 2*y, z*x: x*z + 2*x}
```
Apparently, ``x*y^2-y*z`` should be in the two-sided, but not in the left ideal. And that is indeed what we get:

```
sage: x*y^2-y*z in JL
False
sage: x*y^2-y*z in JT
True
```

Docs are still to fix. And I promise to focus on it - no new features...

The fourth patch does not provide a new feature, but only fixes of bugs, of the doc string formatting, and of the doc tests.

Since I do not have Sage locally, I'd appreciate if one of you could build the documentation and see if it looks nice.

Not a feature, but a fix concerns the hash: If one constructs a g-algebra as one is supposed to (`g_algeba` method resp. unique factory) then the g-algebra is a unique parent. Hence, `id(self)` is a good hash for it, and `__cmp__` can be removed.

Note that the hash in Sage is allowed to change from session to session, so, `id(self)` is fine - see `UniqueRepresentation.__hash__`. Of course, one can destroy the uniqueness on purpose, but that's  not our problem.

Tests in sage/libs/singular, multi_polynomial_ideal.py and plural.pyx pass. I am now running all doc tests, but I think it is OK to put it as "needs review".

Concerning review: I think we should review each other's code. So, in particular, one of you should please review my last three patches.

Please verify if I got the credits (author list) right.

Attachment: **[trac4539_fix_docs.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4539/trac4539_fix_docs.patch.gz)**

It turned out that the element constructor of ideal monoids changed a left ideal into a twosided ideal, which (together with the missing uniqueness of ideal monoids) led to errors in a `loads(dumps(...)==...` test.

I hope all tests will pass by now!

I guess the function `SCA` in the patch does not do the right thing).

I believe that there should be a sub-class of `NCPolynomialRing_plural` for general quotients of g-algebras, and then a sub-sub-class for SCA that uses the specialised implementation from Singular. But that should be on #11878.

It looks like this error already occurs #11856 - can you verify whether the error occurs on 32-bit with #11856? Then it might be better to post your patch there.

Replying to [@malb](#comment%3A105):
> `n_IsOne` was replaced by `ring.cf.nIsOne(foo)`. We didn't remove any functionality, only replaced it by calls which are more explicit about the ring. If in doubt just ask :)

Yep, I already found the replacement (by doing a grep for `n_IsOne` in my `.hg/patches`, when I wanted to find out where that function came from).

I didn't post my rebased patches yet, since I need to fix a few doctest errors.

Actually, the first error is a clear improvement. We have the following doctest:

```
            sage: A.<x,y,z> = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
            sage: H = A.g_algebra({y*x:x*y-z, z*x:x*z+2*x, z*y:y*z-2*y})
            sage: H.inject_variables()
            Defining x, y, z
            sage: I = H.ideal([y^2, x^2, z^2-H.one_element()],coerce=False)
            sage: G = vector(I.gens()); G

            done from the right side.

            (y^2, x^2, z^2 - 1)
            sage: M = I.syzygy_module()
```

With #10903 applied, one gets 9 Syzygies:

```
sage: M[0]
(-z^2 - 8*z - 15, 0, y^2)
sage: M[1]
(0, -z^2 + 8*z - 15, x^2)
sage: M[2]
(x^2*z^2 + 8*x^2*z + 15*x^2, -y^2*z^2 + 8*y^2*z - 15*y^2, -4*x*y*z + 2*z^2 + 2*z)
sage: M[3]

sage: M[4]
(x^3*z^2 + 7*x^3*z + 12*x^3, -x*y^2*z^2 + 9*x*y^2*z - 4*y*z^3 - 20*x*y^2 + 52*y*z^2 - 224*y*z + 320*y, -6*x*z^2)
sage: M[5]

sage: M[6]
(2*x^3*y*z + 8*x^3*y + 9*x^2*z + 27*x^2, -2*x*y^3*z + 8*x*y^3 - 12*y^2*z^2 + 99*y^2*z - 195*y^2, -36*x*y*z + 24*z^2 + 18*z)
sage: M[7]
(x^4*z + 4*x^4, -x^2*y^2*z + 4*x^2*y^2 - 4*x*y*z^2 + 32*x*y*z - 6*z^3 - 64*x*y + 66*z^2 - 240*z + 288, 0)

sage: M[9]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: matrix index out of range
```

However, without #10903 (and with the original patches applied), one gets what is expected in the doc tests, namely 10 Syzygies -- but two of them are identical:

```
sage: M[0]
(-z^2 - 8*z - 15, 0, y^2)
sage: M[1]
(0, -z^2 + 8*z - 15, x^2)

sage: M[5]

sage: M[6]
(2*x^3*y*z + 8*x^3*y + 9*x^2*z + 27*x^2, -2*x*y^3*z + 8*x*y^3 - 12*y^2*z^2 + 99*y^2*z - 195*y^2, -36*x*y*z + 24*z^2 + 18*z)
sage: M[7]
(2*x^3*y*z + 8*x^3*y + 9*x^2*z + 27*x^2, -2*x*y^3*z + 8*x*y^3 - 12*y^2*z^2 + 99*y^2*z - 195*y^2, -36*x*y*z + 24*z^2 + 18*z)
sage: M[8]
(x^4*z + 4*x^4, -x^2*y^2*z + 4*x^2*y^2 - 4*x*y*z^2 + 32*x*y*z - 6*z^3 - 64*x*y + 66*z^2 - 240*z + 288, 0)
sage: M[9]
(x^3*y^2*z + 4*x^3*y^2 + 18*x^2*y*z - 36*x*z^3 + 66*x^2*y - 432*x*z^2 - 1656*x*z - 2052*x, -x*y^4*z + 4*x*y^4 - 8*y^3*z^2 + 62*y^3*z - 114*y^3, 48*y*z^2 - 36*y*z)
sage: M[7]==M[6]
True
```

So, the old Singular version forgot to remove a redundant Syzygy.

Hoorray! The other doctest error was even easier to fix: It has been a new test, and I simply had a typo in it.

Because of #11339 and #10903, I had to change some lines in the code. In order to make the changes more easily visible, I attached the new patches under a new name, so that you can compare them with the old patches.

Could you please have a look whether we can return to the positive review?

<div id="comment:115" align="right">comment:115</div>

I urgently need a break. It is unbelievable how many errors I made in the past 30 minutes.

Anyway.

I have now updated the patch (after first attaching a wrong file, followed by the correct file under a wrong name, and those things).

Note that there is now a new patch at #10903 - without that patch, building the documentation would fail.

The new version of [attachment: trac4539_fix_docs_rel10903.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4539/trac4539_fix_docs_rel10903.patch.gz) fixes one wrongly formatted `.. todo::` directive.

Please test whether the documentation builds fine for you.

Hi Alexander,

Note that there is a new patch at #10903 (where the docbuild crash was introduced), and it fixes the problem in a more satisfying way. The problem was that under certain circumstances the name of a deprecated Cython method could not be determined - but with the new patch from #10903 (actually there are TWO new patches) the problem is fixed.

So, the docbuild reviewer patch is not needed.

It could be that we need some work here. The first patch does not apply when we start with sage-4.8.alpha0. Namely, in sage/libs/singular/function.pyx, it expects the line

What shall we do? In order to avoid premature work, it would be an option to wait until finally all the dependencies got a positive review.
