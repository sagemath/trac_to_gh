The sympow Configure script has a `whichexe` function to determine which `rm`, `grep`, etc to call that effectively does <code>RM=\`which rm\`</code>. If `rm` is an alias (e.g., aliased to `rm -i`), this fails.

REFEREE REPORT:

1. It does not fail is rm is an alias.  It gives the original executable with an exact path. 

```
teragon-2:sympow-1.018.1.p5 wstein$ alias rm="rm -i"
teragon-2:sympow-1.018.1.p5 wstein$ which rm
/bin/rm
teragon-2:sympow-1.018.1.p5 wstein$ RM=`which rm`
teragon-2:sympow-1.018.1.p5 wstein$ echo $RM
/bin/rm
```

So I totally don't get what the problem is.  The above patch would have the effect of making it so the scripts would annoyingly suddenly actually *be* interactive if one has aliased rm to "rm -i".

So from my point of view, it looks like this patch introduces a bug instead of fixing one.

2. This patch would replace all the absolute paths to programs to their names, thus completely removing whatever "upstream's" point was in having those variables.  That's suspicious.

So I'm dubious.

The behavior of "alias" might be shell dependent which might contribute to the problem here. This was initially reported by David Kohel, so let's CC him.

Hi,

Based on Mark's remark below, I give #4261 a positive review, since it does
in fact do just what Mark suggests below.
