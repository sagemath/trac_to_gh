The issue here is that seemingly the 32 bit userspace bits are missing.

The issue is not that bits are missing, the problem is plainly and simply that on Ubuntu multi lib in *any* upstream gcc is broken because the Ubuntu people chose to rename

```
lib64 -> lib
lib -> lib32
```
One can disable multilib support and get a 64 bit gcc on sage.math that way.

Cheers,

Michael
