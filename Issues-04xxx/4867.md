<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
The issue is not that bits are missing, the problem is plainly and simply that on Ubuntu multi lib in *any* upstream gcc is broken because the Ubuntu people chose to rename

```
lib64 -> lib
lib -> lib32
```
One can disable multilib support and get a 64 bit gcc on sage.math that way.

Cheers,

Michael
