I was considering adding doctests to sage/rings/bernoulli.py and discovered that the code has probably not been used much and is broken.  For example, bernoulli_python gives different answers starting from the 28th Bernoulli number, and returns errors for some small positive integers (such as 2 and 4).  For example:

```
q = 28
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='gap')   
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='gp')
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='pari')    
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='python')
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='bernmm')

```

It seems like it would be easiest to delete this file.

The patch removes the file bernoulli.py entirely, since it is broken and redundant, and removes the corresponding option from the bernoulli function in rings/arith.py.

I also added some long tests.  I noticed, but did not fix, a problem with the GAP version of bernoulli, that affects computations of B_{2256} and higher:

```
sage: bernoulli(2256, algorithm = 'gap')
