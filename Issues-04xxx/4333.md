I was considering adding doctests to sage/rings/bernoulli.py and discovered that the code has probably not been used much and is broken.  For example, bernoulli_python gives different answers starting from the 28th Bernoulli number, and returns errors for some small positive integers (such as 2 and 4).  For example:

```
q = 28
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='gap')   
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='gp')
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='pari')    
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='python')
print bernoulli(q, algorithm='bernmm')

The patch removes the file bernoulli.py entirely, since it is broken and redundant, and removes the corresponding option from the bernoulli function in rings/arith.py.

I also added some long tests.  I noticed, but did not fix, a problem with the GAP version of bernoulli, that affects computations of B_{2256} and higher:

```
sage: bernoulli(2256, algorithm = 'gap')
