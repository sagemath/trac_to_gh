Define a newform (up to conjugation)

```
time nf = ModularSymbols(100,2,1).cuspidal_subspace().new_subspace().decomposition()[0]
```

`nf.coefficient_field()` -- should return the field of definition of the newform.  (This appears to be accomplished with `nf.eigenvalue(1).parent()`.  It would be nice to know that this really does give the field of definition.)

`nf.degree()` -- should return the degree of the coefficient field.
