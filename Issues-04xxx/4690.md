Derivatives of piecewise functions where some piece uses multiplication causes Sage to hang. Example code:

```
Piecewise([[(0,1), x * 2]]).derivative()
```

It hangs waiting for Maxima to return a result, which is because the expression it sends to Maxima is not formatted properly.

Looks good to me.  This can go in.

But, piecewise.py needs some _MAJOR_ work for which I will open up a new ticket.

Paul,

in the future please post hg patches and not diffs, i.e. check in your changes and then export a patch. In this case I have committed the changes in your name so that the credit in the hg log is properly assigned.

Cheers,

Michael
