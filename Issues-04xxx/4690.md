Derivatives of piecewise functions where some piece uses multiplication causes Sage to hang. Example code:

```
Piecewise([[(0,1), x * 2]]).derivative()
```

It hangs waiting for Maxima to return a result, which is because the expression it sends to Maxima is not formatted properly.

Looks good to me.  This can go in.

But, piecewise.py needs some `_MAJOR_` work for which I will open up a new ticket.
