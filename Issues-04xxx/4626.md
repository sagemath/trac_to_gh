The problem is somewhere between the Pari interface and Pari itself:

```
sage: R = RealField(53)
sage: n = R(0)
sage: z = R(0)
sage: pari(n).besselj(z, precision=53)

The problem is that Pari is expecting an integer:

sage: R = RealField(53)
sage: n = Integer(0)
sage: z = R(0)
sage: pari(n).besselj(z, precision=53)

I'll post a patch once my 3.3.alpha0 builds...

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
I've reported the problem upstream to Pari.

The patch needs more work since non-integer arguments are no longer allowed:

```
sage: bessel_J(0.1,0)
...
TypeError: Attempt to coerce non-integral RealNumber to Integer
```
This used to work before the patch:

```
sage: bessel_J(0.1,0.1)
0.777264368097005
```
