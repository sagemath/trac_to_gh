There were two issues: one is the headers, the other one was the man page. Craig reviewed the header issue as well as Alexander's fix once I told him what it did.

I did a cp of the whole Sage tree after fixing this and the Singular header permission issue and for now there are no more problems, so Paul can be assured that issue is gone for now. I will keep testing that no other permission issues return since Sage should never be released with such a permission problem.
