The latex output of tableaux is a broke, which affects the latex output in CrystalOfTableaux. Patches that fix this were attached to #4355 but I should have created a new ticket for these since that ticket really proposes something different.

See #4355 for the patches.

See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/3fff0cbc6b44b483?hl=en for discussion. But in a nutshell try 

```
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3],[2,2],[3,4],[4]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,1,2,3,4],[2,2,2],[3]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1],[2],[3],[4]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3,4]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,],[5,6],[7,9]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,],[5,6],[7,9],[9]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3,4,5,],[6]])) 
latex(Tableau([[1,2,3,4,5,],[6],[7],[8],[9]])) 
```

etc or 

```
CrystalOfTableaux("A2",shape=[3,1]).latex_file("/home/bump/tmp/test.tex")
```

to see the defect.

Dan, 

I have moved the patches from #4355 over here and will delete them on the other ticket. Having patches from another ticket applied via this ticket will only make things more complicated than they need to be.

Cheers,

Michael
