This needs to be tested with a wide variety of browsers and OS combinations before this goes in. So please list what browser/OS combo worked for you.

It will likely have to wait for 3.4 anyway.

Cheers,

To test this on supported browsers, we should test it on Firefox, Opera, and Safari.  I've tested it on FF 3.0.5 on Ubuntu 8.10 and the tinyMCE spkg and this patch seem to work okay.

Here are complete instructions to apply and test the tinymce patch:

Apply the following patches from 4674, 3767, 4704, and 4705, in order:

jsmath-spkg.patch
jquery-and-friends-spkg.2.patch
jquery-javascript-cleanup.patch
tinymce-editable.patch
safari-fix.patch

Install the following packages from the above tickets.  You may have to do ./sage -f <spkg URL> to force an installation if you've already installed an spkg.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-3.6a.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/tinyMCE-3.2.0.2.spkg

Optionally, you can also install the jsmath image fonts by installing:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg

Now you should be able to shift-click on a new cell bar to create a text cell using tinyMCE.  You should also be able to double-click on an existing text cell to edit it in-place.

Yes, that sounds like the intended behavior.  Whether or not that should be what happens may be up for debate, though.  The idea is that if you create a text cell, but put nothing in it, it is impossible to edit by double-clicking.  If you make any edits to the cell, though, the filler text goes away.

Hrm, it may be intended, but I don't like it at all. When I clicked "cancel", I wanted the entire business -- text cell and all -- to go away and, well, be cancelled.

I'm also bothered by the text being "ghostly", in that you see it when viewing the notebook normally, but it doesn't show up in the usual text-based "Edit".

I have tested this and it appears to work fine with the following browser/OS combinations:

Ubuntu 8.10:

* Firefox 3.0

Win XP SP3:

* Firefox 3.1 beta
* IE 7
* Opera (whatever the current version is)
* Chrome

OS X 10.5:

* Firefox 3.0
* Safari

Just to screw around, I tried [iCab](http://www.icab.de/), which edited existing fields just fine, but the shift-click on the new cell bar didn't work. I think we can safely ignore the iCab browser market. :)

I used mabshoff's version of the tinymce spkg, seems fine.  I have not inspected it in detail.

I updated to 2.0.0.20 and the problem persists. However, I downloaded FF3.0.5 and the problem is not there, so it's definitely FF2-specific.  My guess is that a lot of people using FF only on occasion (which might be quite a few PC and Mac people, as opposed to Linux) may not even be aware that FF3 is out there (it was very dimly on my radar), so it would be worth at least some testing.

[Here is a worksheet](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~crisman/TinyMCE_Test.sws) - click on the "Here is a problem" area and then scroll up and down, assuming that area appears toward the bottom of your initial browser window.

I am not sure what the problem is - presumably something Aqua+OSX.4+PPC+FF2 related.  It would be nice for people to check out whether this problem shows up in any other less heavily used browsers - Konqueror, for example, if that's still in use.
