This needs to be tested with a wide variety of browsers and OS combinations before this goes in. So please list what browser/OS combo worked for you.

It will likely have to wait for 3.4 anyway.

Here are complete instructions to apply and test the tinymce patch:

Apply the following patches from 4674, 3767, 4704, and 4705, in order:

jsmath-spkg.patch
jquery-and-friends-spkg.2.patch
jquery-javascript-cleanup.patch
tinymce-editable.patch
safari-fix.patch

Install the following packages from the above tickets.  You may have to do ./sage -f <spkg URL> to force an installation if you've already installed an spkg.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-3.6a.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/tinyMCE-3.2.0.2.spkg

Optionally, you can also install the jsmath image fonts by installing:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg

Now you should be able to shift-click on a new cell bar to create a text cell using tinyMCE.  You should also be able to double-click on an existing text cell to edit it in-place.

* Firefox 3.1 beta

It seems a little too demanding to ask that this works on IE 6 on Windows.  Other things don't work on that platform either, or are a little strange.  Is that really officially supported?  If so there should be a lot of tickets for it.  

On Safari on OS 10.4, I had some oddness inserting a text cell at the very top of a worksheet - nothing seemed to happen but when I re-opened it things were OK, the text cell was there.  That should be a followup ticket if anyone can reproduce it, but not enough to block this ticket getting merged in my opinion.

Things seem to work fine on firefox 2.0.0.13 on my mac and windows machines.

The ghost text problem is gone, but there should be an easy way to delete an empty cell.  Currently if you open the text editor and delete all text, there is still some residual empty text cell that you can't see but which blocks cell mergers.  This can be deleted in "Edit" mode for the worksheet but a followup ticket should be made to make it easier.  Again, I don't think that should block this ticket.

I used mabshoff's version of the tinymce spkg, seems fine.  I have not inspected it in detail.

[Here is a worksheet](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~crisman/TinyMCE_Test.sws) - click on the "Here is a problem" area and then scroll up and down, assuming that area appears toward the bottom of your initial browser window.

I am not sure what the problem is - presumably something Aqua+OSX.4+PPC+FF2 related.
