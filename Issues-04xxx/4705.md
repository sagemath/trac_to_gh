This needs to be tested with a wide variety of browsers and OS combinations before this goes in. So please list what browser/OS combo worked for you.

It will likely have to wait for 3.4 anyway.

Here are complete instructions to apply and test the tinymce patch:

Apply the following patches from 4674, 3767, 4704, and 4705, in order:

jsmath-spkg.patch
jquery-and-friends-spkg.2.patch
jquery-javascript-cleanup.patch
tinymce-editable.patch
safari-fix.patch

Install the following packages from the above tickets.  You may have to do ./sage -f <spkg URL> to force an installation if you've already installed an spkg.

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-3.6a.spkg
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/tinyMCE-3.2.0.2.spkg

Optionally, you can also install the jsmath image fonts by installing:
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg

Now you should be able to shift-click on a new cell bar to create a text cell using tinyMCE.  You should also be able to double-click on an existing text cell to edit it in-place.

I followed the instructions in [comment 14](#comment%3A14) and there's at least one small problem. If I shift-click on the new cell bar, I get the TinyMCE editor thingy. If I click "cancel" without entering any text, the tooltip text ("Doubleclick to edit...") gets put into a text cell at that location.

If I choose "Edit" at the top, the text "Doubleclick to edit..." doesn't show up in the notebook, and if I click "Save changes", the extraneous text goes away.

This happens in Firefox, Opera, IE7, and Chrome. I applied all the patches and spkgs to 3.2.3.

I'm also bothered by the text being "ghostly", in that you see it when viewing the notebook normally, but it doesn't show up in the usual text-based "Edit".

I have tested this and it appears to work fine with the following browser/OS combinations:

Ubuntu 8.10:

* Firefox 3.0

Win XP SP3:

* Firefox 3.1 beta
* IE 7
* Opera (whatever the current version is)
* Chrome

OS X 10.5:

* Firefox 3.0
* Safari

Just to screw around, I tried [iCab](http://www.icab.de/), which edited existing fields just fine, but the shift-click on the new cell bar didn't work. I think we can safely ignore the iCab browser market. :)

> Note that Firefox 2.0 has apparently been EOL'ed: [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-older.html](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-older.html). How long should we continue testing on that browser? (I'm not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely curious.)


I updated to 2.0.0.20 and the problem persists. However, I downloaded FF3.0.5 and the problem is not there, so it's definitely FF2-specific.  My guess is that a lot of people using FF only on occasion (which might be quite a few PC and Mac people, as opposed to Linux) may not even be aware that FF3 is out there (it was very dimly on my radar), so it would be worth at least some testing.

[Here is a worksheet](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~crisman/TinyMCE_Test.sws) - click on the "Here is a problem" area and then scroll up and down, assuming that area appears toward the bottom of your initial browser window.

I am not sure what the problem is - presumably something Aqua+OSX.4+PPC+FF2 related.  It would be nice for people to check out whether this problem shows up in any other less heavily used browsers - Konqueror, for example, if that's still in use.  If this is the only place it happens, perhaps it's not the worst thing ever - though it IS really hard to use in this one case.

Yes, if the patch here in question does not mess up existing functionality, but has issues with the new functionality with some browsers this can be dealt with via a followup ticket. Getting this in working 99% now is much better than it bitrotting and I think Jason will be much happier, too :)
