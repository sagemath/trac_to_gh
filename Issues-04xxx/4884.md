The colormap code is currently ad hoc and copied in all GraphicsPrimitive subclasses that need it.

This patch fixes this by introducing a get_cmap() function in sage.plot.misc that the graphic primitives can call to make sense of what they are passed.

It also adds the option to specify a sequence of colors and use that as the colormap.

For the documentation I added a cmap_help() function which is imported in the global namespace that the docstrings can point to and that will explain what are the possible options, the valid names and everything since the names change rather often.

I think this patch is a great idea. (In fact, I wonder if a similar plot_help() and plot3d_help() function might be useful.)

However, after the patch is applied, using 3.2.2 on an amd64 ubuntu 8.10 machine, this test failure occurs:

I don't think you need another version of Sage since I developed it on 3.2.2.  

There is a part in the patch which removes these tests from matrix_plot.py, so I can only guess that the patch didn't apply properly.

Maybe try again with a clean tree.

At a bare minimum, the docstring should explain precisely what one needs to type to get a list of all valid colormaps.  This could be included in a docstring, so that when matplotlib changes the colormap options, the docstring will suddenly break, and we will know to fix it.

Incidentally, right now one way to get a list of valid colormaps is to just make a mistake with the cmap option, and a list of all valid options is displayed.

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: z = contour_plot(cos(x^2+y^2), (-4, 4), (-4, 4),cmap='foobar')  
sage: z.save('a.png')                                               
```

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\n> Is this what you want? If not, what do you want? \n\n\nI was suggesting not dotting out the output of `cmap_help()`.  We run the test suite before any release, and if the cmap actually does change in matplotlib, then we'll know since the relevant doctest will fail.    The Sage library and its test suite is designed to work with precisely one version of matplotlib -- the one we ship with Sage -- so you don't have to worry about making the doctest example work with numerous different versions. \n\nIn short, I was suggesting a way that the list of all valid colormaps could be safely displayed in the docstrings of the functions that use them.  This would avoid having to have a function `cmap_help()` in the global namespace, and means that people can instantly just see the list of colormaps instead of having to carefully read the docstring, figure out that there is a function cmap_help, then call it, etc., which to some would feel like an awkward workflow.",

> Is this what you want? If not, what do you want? 


I was suggesting not dotting out the output of `cmap_help()`.  We run the test suite before any release, and if the cmap actually does change in matplotlib, then we'll know since the relevant doctest will fail.    The Sage library and its test suite is designed to work with precisely one version of matplotlib -- the one we ship with Sage -- so you don't have to worry about making the doctest example work with numerous different versions. 

In short, I was suggesting a way that the list of all valid colormaps could be safely displayed in the docstrings of the functions that use them.  This would avoid having to have a function `cmap_help()` in the global namespace, and means that people can instantly just see the list of colormaps instead of having to carefully read the docstring, figure out that there is a function cmap_help, then call it, etc., which to some would feel like an awkward workflow.

Attachment [trac_4884_2.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4884/trac_4884_2.patch) by abergeron created at 2008-12-29 20:43:33

To address was' comments (I hope), I killed the cmap_help() function, put the appropriate info in all the relevant docstrings and added a mention about how to obtain the colormap names.

I know you said you would prefer to include the list directly in the docstring, but I don't think this would be productive as it would require adding a doctest somewhere to check that the list has not changed and then when that breaks, have the one responsible manually update all the colormap lists, making sure to not forget every place where this info could have been copy and pasted and to fix the doctest.

In short, it might be better, but I don't feel it is maintainable.  Now if there was some way to automatically include the current list in the docstrings, then that is another story.

That could certainly be done in Python (e.g., by playing tricks with the method that gives the docstring), but it wouldn't necessarily be a good idea.  It would be fun as a challenge though :-)

Just for clarification, I'm 100% ok with this patch going in as is if somebody else gave it a positive review.  I don't think my suggestions are at all something that should stop this getting a positive review!

Questions: 

1. abergeron's last statement makes it sound like he *wants* the cmap_help function back in, yet both patches were applied.

2. was' review implied that abergeron should let the ellipses below

```       
                <BLANKLINE> 
	        The valid colormap names are: 
	        ... 
```
be replaced by the actual output of cmap_help.

3. was' review also implies that for every function (e.g. matrix_plot) where cmap is an option, that function's docstring should have as a doctest a full call of cmap_help with its output, and that the review also said it was okay if that didn't happen for this patch to go in.  That sounds like someone should have opened another ticket for this behavior.

Are any of these correct?  Just checking; there has been a monumental amount of fantastic work in 3.3!
