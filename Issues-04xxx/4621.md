Reported by Alex Raichev
on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/wRKJ15QpmQM).

```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
sage: a^2
2
sage: a^2 in QQ
True
sage: a^2 in QQbar
False
sage: 2 in QQbar
True 
```
or more directly

```
sage: F(2) in QQbar
False
```

Perhaps related to this is

```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 2)
sage: QQ.is_subring(F)
True
sage: F.is_subring(QQbar)
False 
```

Robert Bradshow comments that `F.is_subring(QQbar)` should be `False`, because `QQbar` has a canonical embedding into `CC`, but `F` has not.

So, from that point of view, it makes sense that `a^2` is in `F` but not in `QQbar`. However, `a^2` is equal to `2` after all, and hence is in a part of `F` that *does* have a canonical embedding.

In other words, we have a field element `x` in `F_1` such that there is in fact a subfield `F_2` of `F_1` with `x` in `F_1`. Moreover, we have a field `F_3` such that `F_2` has a canonical embedding into `F_3`, but `F_1` has no canonical embedding.

Is it possible for Sage to detect that situation? 

Idea: Is there a *unique* maximal subfield `F_m` of `F_1` that has a canonical embedding into `F_3`? If there is, there could be a method `max_subfield_coercing_into(...)`. 

Then, in the original example, we probably have 

```
sage: F.max_subfield_coercing_into(QQbar)
Rational Field
```
and then `x in QQbar` would answer `True`, since

```
sage: x in F_1.max_subfield_coercing_into(QQbar)
True
```

Sorry if that idea is not realistic.

A side effect of this patch is the following because it now tries to explicitly convert its argument to QQ. Is that desirable?

```
sage: GF(7)(2) in QQbar
True
```

(Related 'in's:

```
sage: GF(7)(2) in ZZ
True
sage: GF(7)(2) in QQ
False
sage: GF(7)(2) in QQbar
True
```

The reason why this fails is

```
sage: F.<a>= NumberField(x^2-2)
sage: two = F(2)
sage: QQbar(two)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number
```
One way to fix it is to be more flexible on creation of algebraic number (in `AA._element_constructor_` or `QQbar._element_constructor_`) or to implement a method `_algebraic_` to number field elements.

the above is fixed in #14485 and #20400 but it does not solve the containment test!

The embedding is not set by writing only `QuadraticField(2)` (see also [#30518 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30518#comment:10)). You can compare with

```
sage: root2 = QuadraticField(2, embedding=AA(2).sqrt()).gen()
sage: root2 in QQbar, root2^2 in QQbar
(True, True)
```
Though the following is definitely annoying

```
sage: QuadraticField(2).one() in QQbar  # would better be true
False
```
