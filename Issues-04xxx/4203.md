[17:06] <mhansen> Yeah -- suboption should take a prefix, defaults, and then return something like an arrow_options dict.
[17:07] <mhansen> @suboption('arrow', color='red', line='+')
[17:07] <jason-> okay, yeah, even better.
[17:07] <mhansen> And that would pick up things like arrow_color='blue'.
[17:07] <jason-> then I don't have to type the dictionary explicitly
[17:09] <mhansen> I think doing something like that might be a good idea.  It'd at least be a nice consistent way to handle all of these options.
```

The idea is that we'd like to get a bunch of options to pass on to, say, an arrow_drawing routine.  It'd be really nice if we could rename the suboptions too, so the original arrow_color argument could be returned as the rgbcolor element of the arrow_options dict.

Use case:

```
@suboption('arrow', color='red', line_style='+')
@options(vertices=True, edge_labels=True)
def plot_graph():
    draw vertices
    for each edge:
        draw_arrow(**arrow_options)
    draw edge labels
```
so the plot_graph function has options arrow_color and arrow_line_style, but inside the function, it just sees an arrow_options dictionary populated from these.

Very nice.  Positive review.

Eventually, we ought to present a nice documentation interface to the user of the combined effect of the suboptions, the options and the rename_keyword decorators.  In other words, some automated way of getting exactly everything that a person can do to a function.  But that should be another trac ticket. 

All doctests in plot/*.py pass with this patch.

I got this with a quick test.

```
sage: @suboptions('test')
def f(**kwds):
....:     print kwds
....:     
sage: f(test_size=2)
{'test_options': {'ize': 2}}
```

str.lstrip removes all characters given from the front of the string:

```
sage: 'baba_baca'.lstrip('ab_')
'ca'
```
