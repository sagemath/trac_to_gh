```
Currently, we've got excellent code to run Cython in parallel as part of the Sage build process. However, once we ask distutils to begin compiling that code, everything is done in serial, because distutils works solely in serial. 

## The Code

The attached file changes that. This (somewhat brutally) hacks distutils to dispatch the calls to build C/C++ extensions in parallel, using pyprocessing. (I totally jacked William's code from #3765 for this.) Here's how to put this code in place:

* download the attached file (`build_ext.py`)
* replace `$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.5/distutils/command/build_ext.py` with the new version.
  
Now, if you want to test the new code, do the following:

* set the environment variable `SAGE_PARALLEL_DIST` to something. (The code just checks to see if the variable is defined at all.)
* set the environment variable `MAKE` to `MAKE -j2`, where `2` is replaced by the number of simultaneous build processes you want. 
* build.

## Notes

If you want to test this, don't go around touching the `.pyx` files in the Sage library, since Cython is much slower than `gcc`. Instead, simply go around touching the `.c` and `.cpp` files in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage`. One of the cool features we added with the new build system is that these files get recompiled when they change.

There is now a line that prints as part of the build process that looks like:

```
Total time spent compiling C/C++ extensions:  5.2876701355 seconds.
```
So try touching a bunch of files in the Sage library, and seeing what kind of speedups you get.

There are two caveats I want to offer with this code: 

* Michael points out that numpy does a lot with distutils. I could very well have broken their use of distutils.
* I don't do anything involving dependency tracking between extensions. In particular, if there are extensions that have to be built in a certain order, this code could break it. (This code still compiles all source files **within** an extension in the usual way.) Neither Michael nor I could think of a situation where this would break anything in Sage, but who knows ...

## The Plan

So while this code is cool, and will definitely save a ton of CPU time on `sage.math` (**cough** mabshoff **cough**), the plan is **not** to maintain it as a part of the Sage Python spkg indefinitely. Instead, if it seems to work well, then we should try to clean this code up a bit more and upstream it, since pyprocessing is standard in Python 2.6.

Just out of curiosity, did you try to get this to work without modifying build_ext.py at all, but by simply changing stuff in that module at runtime, like I illustrate in #3765?

Here's the diff of what you did:

There is a slight chicken and egg problem here since we build pyprocessing after python, so if someone sets the wrong environment variable the build of Python itself will blow up.

To fix this:

* make sure to unset SAGE_PARALLEL_DIST for the python.spkg as well as the pyprocessing.spkg
* make all the other python based spkgs depend on pyprocessing, so it is immediately build after Python

Then this should work out of the box, even though we should still test this with a couple rounds of builds of Sage with a high parallel level to make sure we do not hit any race conditions.

Cheers,

Michael

Ok, new version of the code is up. This is done differently than last time; rather than patch our python, I'm simply inserting the code in our `setup.py`, and calling distutils with the new code **only** from Sage. 

So, to test this, do the following:

* download and apply trac-4652-testing.patch
* set the env variable `SAGE_PARALLEL_DIST` to anything
* set the env variable `MAKE` to something like `make -j168` (where 168 is the number of simultaneous threads you want)
* `sage -br` or `sage -ba`

If this seems to work for people, then we can try building Sage from scratch with it. (I'm going to try setting my machine to do that overnight with `4.0.1.rc2`, I think.) If it works fine, I just want to add a little bit of documentation and then I'm happy to have this merged. If it works for a release or so, I'll start working on getting **something** like this upstream. (I have no idea how uphill that battle will be.)
