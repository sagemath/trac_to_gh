```
sage: var('y')
sage: plot3d(x^2*y,(-1,1),(-1,1))
```

This takes for ever, even when run as the first command after restarting a notebook.  On the other hand, it takes about 1 second to do

```
sage: var('y')
sage: plot3d(sin(sin(x) + y^2),(-1,1),(-1,1))

I just reproduced this problem on a freshly built 3.1.2.rc1, on OS X 10.5.4 intel macbook.  All I did was start sage in the terminal:

```
sage: version()
'SAGE Version 3.1.2.rc1, Release Date: 2008-09-08'
sage: var('y')
y
sage: plot3d(x^2*y,(-1,1),(-1,1))
```

This is still going 5 minutes later.  There is a process called lisp.run eating up about 90% of my processor power, with memory usage steady around 17 MB.  The same thing happens in the notebook.  Pressinc ctrl-c gives

```
Control-C pressed.  Interrupting Maxima. Please wait a few seconds...
```

Which also seems to persist indefinitely.  I eventually killed things by closing the terminal window.

Here's something else that takes virtually no time to run:

```
sage: plot3d(x^2*y,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1))
```

But these commands also run indefinitely

```
sage: plot3d(x + y,(-1,1),(-1,1))
sage: plot3d(y*x,(-1,1),(-1,1))
```

The problem here is likely a clisp linked against either the system or a MacPorts/Fink libpng.dylib. Various people have attempted to reproduce this problem and have failed. So I am closing it as invalid since one can no longer build with MacPorts/Fink in $PATH.

Cheers,
