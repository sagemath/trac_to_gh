This patch depends on #4432. It replaces the factorial in sage.rings.arith with the symbolic
version of #4432 in sage.calculus.calculus.

For now sage.rings.arith.factorial is just renamed to factorial_numeric, otherwise I got
circular imports at Sage startup.

The patch is against sage-3.2alpha1.

After applying this patch plus the patches at #4432 all doctests passed.

A sample session:

```
sage: gamma(x/2)(x=5)
3*sqrt(pi)/4

sage: f = factorial(x + factorial(y))
sage: maxima(f).sage()
factorial(factorial(y) + x)

sage: f(y=x)(x=3)
362880
```

I wanted to remove the factorial in rings.arith completely, because I think it is confusing
to have to different factorial functions at the toplevel. Also Sage doesn't do this for the
other symbolic functions like sin().

In the previous version rings.arith.factorial_numeric() was just there because I had not yet
solved the problem of circular imports at Sage startup.

Now second patch that I just uploaded fixes this problem. Now there is only the factorial
in calculus.all.

With both patches applied to sage-3.2alpha1 all doctests pass for me.

A couple remarks:

* the first patch removes "!" from the list of tokens which we used to ignore up to now. Now it changes meaning to be factorial, but I am not so sure it is a good idea since we use to explicitly forbid it. I don't know the reason why we did that, so see my comment below.
* the second patch removes fact() [nee factorial_numeric()] from arith.py, but policy is to deprecate removed functions, especially something as simple and long existing like fact() in that file cannot be just removed. See "def dynkin_diagram(t)" in combinat/root_system/dynkin_diagram.py for an good example on how to use deprecation in Sage. 

Especially the "!" change should be discussed on [sage-devel] since that is a rather fundamental change. I also cannot find a single occurrence of "!" in the docstring or tests, but maybe I  overlooked something. *If* the patch is merged with the "!" change it needs to be doctests.
