**Attachment:** [trac_4006.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4006/trac_4006.patch.gz)

This code is totally broken due to the imports at the top.  Plus, it's old, untested, and a bit crufty.

+1. Should anybody want this code he/she has to resubmit it. It has been broken since at least Sage 0.10.12, so good riddance. Positive review.
