We provide an implementation of Puiseux series, that is power series in `x^(1/n)` where `n` is an arbitrary integer.

When the base ring is an algebraically closed field, this is an algebraically closed field. In other words, any polynomial in `QQ[X,Y]` has a solution in `Y` as a Puiseux series in `X` over `QQbar`.

Thanks to **chapoton** for offering to plug this code into Sage!

On a side note, I also have some code for computing Puiseux series representations of places on a plane algebraic curve. The entry function is `abelfunctions.puiseux_series.puiseux_series`. I'm sure someone with better Sage skills than myself can improve the algorithm and plug that in as well.

<a id='comment:24'></a>This is a nice addition. Is it ready for review?

A few comments:

- Is it planned to extend it to the multivariate case?
- It would be nice to add a more detailed mathematical explanation about what a Puiseux series is in the docstring.

<a id='comment:33'></a>I do the following changes:

1. Adaptation to current version 8.8.beta3 in order to have the code compile again.
2. I replace the method `_cmp_` of `PuiseuxSeries` by `_richcmp_` and let it completely rely on the corresponding method of class `LaurentSeries`. The reason for this is not only modernisation, but also that the former method doesn't work correctly (for example comparison with zero returns wrong results).
3. I add a specification of the representative of the Puiseux series inside the constructor of `PuiseuxSeries` in such a way that the ramification index is minimized. This improves the methods `laurent_series` and `power_series` (the examples given there would not work else-wise).
4. I add more doctests.

There is still work to do, for example:

1. There are several workarounds on other bugs in Sage. In general I think, these workarounds should be removed and the corresponding bugs should be treated in separate tickets. Examples:
   a. In the methods `_repr_`, `exponents` and `coefficients` there is the following comment: *NOTE: `self.__l.coefficients()` is bugged when the coefficients are in QQbar but coerced into SR ...*. I have no idea how far it makes sense to consider Puiseux series (Laurent series, polynomial rings, ...) over the `SymbolicRing`. But since these constructions are possible, they should work (or should be blocked). There are simple examples where this is not the case:

```
sage: PS = PolynomialRing(SR,'x')
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: q = P((1,1,5)); q
5*x^2 + x + 1
sage: p = PS(q)
sage: p.coefficients()
[5*x^2 + x + 1]
sage: p in SR
True
``` 
    Is this a known bug? Concerning the methods in question, I think that they should rely more directly on the according methods of `LaurentSeries`.
b. In the method `add_bigoh` the following error is caught:

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: q = x^2 + x^3
sage: q.add_bigoh(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: prec (= -3) must be non-negative
```
    This should be fixed in `LaurentSeries`.

2. I think we should clarify the following behavior of the method `add_bigoh`:

```
sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: p = x**(-1/3) + 2*x**(1/5)
sage: p.add_bigoh(1/2)
x^(-1/3) + 2*x^(1/5) + O(x^(7/15))
```
   is this acceptable?

3. The method `_repr_` needs work:

```
sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(Zp(5))
sage: x**(1/2) + 5 * x^(1/3)
5 + O(5^21)*x^(1/3) + (1 + O(5^20))*x^(1/2)
```

4. Further doctests are needed.
5. Integration into documentation.

I will continue to work on this ticket according to feedback!

The multiplication of memory-size is caused by the call of the `V`-method (implemented for  Puiseux series) in the Laurent series class but it happens in the polynomial attached to the power series of the attached Laurent series.

```
sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: s = t.laurent_part().valuation_zero_part().polynomial()
sage: len(s.list())
2209
sage: len(p.laurent_part().valuation_zero_part().polynomial().list())
93
```

So the most generic option would be to implement a data-compression in the corresponding polynomial class. But this may involve external software as in the case of the example:

```
sage: type(s)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint'>
```

The same thing is true concerening the level of power series (for exmaple choosing `implementation='pari'`). So I think, the best place for implementing a smarter data structure would be the Laurent series class and could be done there by a //scale factor// as it is mentined in the article concerning the implementation in OSCAR: "Laurent series themselves are also stored with a valuation, precision and a scale factor".

My suggestion is, to open a new ticket on that task concerning such an implementation for the Laurent series. The method `V` should than just change the scale factor (instead of stretching the data volume). The implementaion of the Puiseux series could stay as it is. In opposite to `ramifications_index` to new scale factor could be named `covering_index`, for instance.

BTW: what does this `V` stand for?

Do you mean to make the Laurent series be Puiseux series with ramification index 1? I like this idea, but wouldn't this lead to larger changes in the Laurent series classes? Shall we deal with that in this ticket?

Vincent, I had a look at that problem, again. Did you declare a sparse `PuiseuxSeriesRing`? How did you measure the consumption of memory? Declaring a sparse ring at least produces a 9 times smaller dump string:

```
sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: len(p.dumps())
826
sage: len(t.dumps())
8688

sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: len(p.dumps())
903
sage: len(t.dumps())
923
```

I think, it would make sense to have the default on `sparse` to be `True` in the case of Puiseux series, since for non trivial ramification index its attached Laurent series is sparse by construction.

Btw, in the blog you have linked to the ticket William Bruce Hart seems to have worked out his 'SageMath example' using a dense representation (see for example `R.<q> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, default_prec=9001)` and this citation "Because of the dense representation in Sage, this would kill performance"). A reason for this choice is not given. I guess that Sage would have produced better scores with a sparse representation.

Yes, that is correct. It shouldn't require many changes I would think as it should be a matter of just (re)moving methods from the Laurent series and setting the Laurent series as a subclass. However, I haven't looked too closely at it.

<a id='comment:61'></a>Unfortunately I have some more comments that I think should be addressed before a positive review:

In `_coerce_map_from_`:

```diff
         EXAMPLES::
+
             sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
```

Also, some small doc tweaks:

```diff
 cdef class PuiseuxSeries(AlgebraElement):
     r"""
+    A Puiseux series.
+
     We store a Puiseux series
```
Common practice is to have the `__init__` be the first method, and all of its doc should be moved to the class-level doc (with some formatting improvements done) with a `TestSuite(foo).run()` being in the `__init__`'s docstring.

IIRC `long` is going away in Python3, and better overall I think would be a `size_t` for the `_e` attribute. Also, since `_l` is a Laurent series, shouldn't it also be a `LaurentSeries` object.

Why also is `laurent_part` a ``@`property` and not just a normal method? (I think `p.laurent_part()` is actually wrong because of this and should be `p.laurent_part`, but that is moot if that changes.)

Probably good idea to break encapsulation and not have the function call here: `return self._l.laurent_polynomial()(t)` (i.e., just access the underlying polynomial).

For the `_richcmp_`, I think it would be a good idea to not call `V` on the underlying Laurent polynomials and instead implement a proper comparison as this will be significantly faster.

I think we should change the MIT license to our standard license. I believe this is compatible.

That would avoid having a lot of duplicated code. At the moment the code attached to ticket #9289 is not far away from being copy pasted from the corresponding classes for Laurent polynomials with some name refactoring done.

But maybe it's a good idea to have the implementation of the Puiseux polynomial rely as much as possible on the Puiseux series. That would avoid having a lot of duplicated code. At the moment the code attached to ticket #9289 is not far away from being copy pasted from the corresponding classes for Laurent polynomials with some name refactoring done. So we would not loose that much if we decide to implement the Puiseux polynomials as "restricted Puiseux series".

What is standing against that?
