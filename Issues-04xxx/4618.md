We provide an implementation of Puiseux series, that is power series in `x^(1/n)` where `n` is an arbitrary integer.

When the base ring is an algebraically closed field, this is an algebraically closed field. In other words, any polynomial in `QQ[X,Y]` has a solution in `Y` as a Puiseux series in `X` over `QQbar`.

Hi ljpk,

requests like this shouls always go to [sage-devel] too since people generally do not look for things to do in trac. Sending the same request to [sage-devel] will make people aware of the problem and might get some design discussion going. Obviously if you are working on code this is different, but if you expect someone else to do the dirty work a little advertisement cannot hurt :)

Cheers,

Michael

As mentioned in an email correspondence with **chapoton** I believe my implementation of `PuiseuxSeriesRing` and `PuiseuxSeriesRingElement`to be pretty complete in regards to fitting into Sage's coercion model. Hopefully it will, at the very least, be a good starting point.

Thanks to **chapoton** for offering to plug this code into Sage!

On a side note, I also have some code for computing Puiseux series representations of places on a plane algebraic curve. The entry function is `abelfunctions.puiseux_series.puiseux_series`. I'm sure someone with better Sage skills than myself can improve the algorithm and plug that in as well.

This is a nice addition. Is it ready for review?

A few comments:

- It would be nice to add a more detailed mathematical explanation about what a Puiseux series is in the docstring.

It is probably not ready, there seems to be a bug lurking around.

No plan to implement the multivariate case.

and the coverage is not 100%

An innocent operation like the following will multiply the memory footprint by 24 with no change in information

```
sage: p = prod(1 - q^n + O(q^100) for n in range(1,100))   # fine: 100 * coeff size

I do the following changes:

1. Adaptation to current version 8.8.beta3 in order to have the code compile again.
2. I replace the method `_cmp_` of `PuiseuxSeries` by `_richcmp_` and let it completely rely on the corresponding method of class `LaurentSeries`. The reason for this is not only modernisation, but also that the former method doesn't work correctly (for example comparison with zero returns wrong results).
3. I add a specification of the representative of the Puiseux series inside the constructor of `PuiseuxSeries` in such a way that the ramification index is minimized. This improves the methods `laurent_series` and `power_series` (the examples given there would not work else-wise).
4. I add more doctests.

There is still work to do, for example:

1. There are several workarounds on other bugs in Sage. In general I think, these workarounds should be removed and the corresponding bugs should be treated in separate tickets. Examples:
   a. In the methods `_repr_`, `exponents` and `coefficients` there is the following comment: *NOTE: `self.__l.coefficients()` is bugged when the coefficients are in QQbar but coerced into SR ...*. I have no idea how far it makes sense to consider Puiseux series (Laurent series, polynomial rings, ...) over the `SymbolicRing`. But since these constructions are possible, they should work (or should be blocked). There are simple examples where this is not the case:

```
sage: PS = PolynomialRing(SR,'x')
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: q = P((1,1,5)); q
5*x^2 + x + 1
sage: p = PS(q)
sage: p.coefficients()
[5*x^2 + x + 1]
sage: p in SR
True
``` 
    Is this a known bug? Concerning the methods in question, I think that they should rely more directly on the according methods of `LaurentSeries`.
b. In the method `add_bigoh` the following error is caught:

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: q = x^2 + x^3
sage: q.add_bigoh(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: prec (= -3) must be non-negative
```
    This should be fixed in `LaurentSeries`.

2. I think we should clarify the following behavior of the method `add_bigoh`:

```
sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: p = x**(-1/3) + 2*x**(1/5)
sage: p.add_bigoh(1/2)
x^(-1/3) + 2*x^(1/5) + O(x^(7/15))
```
   is this acceptable?

3. The method `_repr_` needs work:

```
sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(Zp(5))
sage: x**(1/2) + 5 * x^(1/3)
5 + O(5^21)*x^(1/3) + (1 + O(5^20))*x^(1/2)
```

4. Further doctests are needed.
5. Integration into documentation.

I will continue to work on this ticket according to feedback!

The multiplication of memory-size is caused by the call of the `V`-method (implemented for  Puiseux series) in the Laurent series class but it happens in the polynomial attached to the power series of the attached Laurent series.

```
sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: s = t.laurent_part().valuation_zero_part().polynomial()
sage: len(s.list())
2209
sage: len(p.laurent_part().valuation_zero_part().polynomial().list())
93
```

So the most generic option would be to implement a data-compression in the corresponding polynomial class. But this may involve external software as in the case of the example:

```
sage: type(s)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint.Polynomial_rational_flint'>
```

The same thing is true concerening the level of power series (for exmaple choosing `implementation='pari'`). So I think, the best place for implementing a smarter data structure would be the Laurent series class and could be done there by a *scale factor* as it is mentined in the article concerning the implementation in OSCAR: "Laurent series themselves are also stored with a valuation, precision and a scale factor".

My suggestion is, to open a new ticket on that task concerning such an implementation for the Laurent series. The method `V` should than just change the scale factor (instead of stretching the data volume). The implementaion of the Puiseux series could stay as it is. In opposite to `ramifications_index` to new scale factor could be named `covering_index`, for instance.

BTW: what does this `V` stand for?

I almost feel like we should just extend the Laurent series class with the necessary features with `_e` to avoid duplication (that one extra little bit of information shouldn't change the speed or have a real affect on memory).

Thanks for bringing this ahead that much, Travis!

The only tasks being left from my comment #33 are 3) and 5). With respect to the former item I rewrite `_repr_` such that it just transforms the representation string of the corresponding Laurent series. Concerning the latter I include the docs. They look well formatted.

Do you mean to make the Laurent series be Puiseux series with ramification index 1? I like this idea, but wouldn't this lead to larger changes in the Laurent series classes? Shall we deal with that in this ticket?

Vincent, I had a look at that problem, again. Did you declare a sparse `PuiseuxSeriesRing`? How did you measure the consumption of memory? Declaring a sparse ring at least produces a 9 times smaller dump string:

```
sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: len(p.dumps())
826
sage: len(t.dumps())
8688

sage: P.<q> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = prod((1 - q^n).add_bigoh(100) for n in range(1,100))
sage: t = q^(1/24) * p
sage: len(p.dumps())
903
sage: len(t.dumps())
923
```

I think, it would make sense to have the default on `sparse` to be `True` in the case of Puiseux series, since for non trivial ramification index its attached Laurent series is sparse by construction.

Btw, in the blog you have linked to the ticket William Bruce Hart seems to have worked out his 'SageMath example' using a dense representation (see for example `R.<q> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ, default_prec=9001)` and this citation "Because of the dense representation in Sage, this would kill performance"). A reason for this choice is not given. I guess that Sage would have produced better scores with a sparse representation.

Please do, although that might depend on the sparsity too. However, I leave it to people who are more expert in the area to determine whether or not the default should be sparse or not.

I do the following changes:

1. I add a dependency to ticket #28239, since this bug of the Laurent series, becomes much more relevant for Puiseux series.

2. I add the keyword `prec` to the _element constructor_, to achieve compatibility with the power series (see ticket #28993, but observe that my implementation is independent of that ticket).

3. I let the Puiseux series be recognized by the global `bigoh` function `O`.

4. I add the still missing doctests and do related small fixes.

5. I insert missing copyright notes.

Concerning the introduction of a scale factor according to comment 42, I've opened ticket #28992.

Unfortunately I have some more comments that I think should be addressed before a positive review:

In `_coerce_map_from_`:

```diff
         EXAMPLES::
+
             sage: R.<x> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
```

Also, some small doc tweaks:

```diff
 cdef class PuiseuxSeries(AlgebraElement):
     r"""
+    A Puiseux series.
+
     We store a Puiseux series
```
Common practice is to have the `__init__` be the first method, and all of its doc should be moved to the class-level doc (with some formatting improvements done) with a `TestSuite(foo).run()` being in the `__init__`'s docstring.

IIRC `long` is going away in Python3, and better overall I think would be a `size_t` for the `_e` attribute. Also, since `_l` is a Laurent series, shouldn't it also be a `LaurentSeries` object.

Why also is `laurent_part` a `@property` and not just a normal method? (I think `p.laurent_part()` is actually wrong because of this and should be `p.laurent_part`, but that is moot if that changes.)

Probably good idea to break encapsulation and not have the function call here: `return self._l.laurent_polynomial()(t)` (i.e., just access the underlying polynomial).

For the `_richcmp_`, I think it would be a good idea to not call `V` on the underlying Laurent polynomials and instead implement a proper comparison as this will be significantly faster.

I think we should change the MIT license to our standard license. I believe this is compatible.
