The part 3 patch that I applied does some re-architect-ing of the sage --> magma conversion system so now one can define either `_magma_init_` in the very simple case when a pure string is enough or `_magma_coerce_` when one wants to do arbitrarily complicated stuff but doesn't want to have to worry about caching. 

 Caching turns out to be extremely important, e.g., coercing the same number field twice into magma without caching would result in two separate copies of that number field in Magma with no coercion maps, which would cause lots of problems for other things.  This re-architecting will surely be needed all over the place as the Magma / Sage interface gets steadily improved.

It's possible that the choices of names is not optimal.  Using `_magma_coerce_` was better than anything else I could think of (e.g., `_magma_not_cached_`, `_magma_impl_`, etc.).

Looks good to me. This looks like it's more magma -> sage (I can't get number fields back into Sage for example), but that doesn't look like the intent of the ticket. 

In terms of naming, perhaps `_magma_convert_` would be another alternative (coercion happens implicitly, conversion only when explicitly asked for). The caching architecture looks fine.

So the rename would turn this into a positive review?

And indeed, this was definitely not meant to be feature complete, but a first self-contained step before I do a lot more that uses the same architecture.
