This follows on from #3674, where integral points for elliptic curves over Q were implemented.

The work here was done (again) by Tobias Nagel and Michael Mardaus, with some necessary backup functionality for elliptic curve local data by me (John Cremona) which has already been merged.

Two functions are defined:  (1) `padic_elliptic_logarithm()` for points on curves over number fields, in ell_point.py; (2) `S_integral_points()` for curves over Q only (so far!), in ell_rational field.py.

The patch s_int_pts.patch applies to 3.2.1 + the patches at #4715.  Should be ready for review soon...

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**CC:**  mardaus tnagel

**Resolution:** fixed

The second patch fixes various issues with the padic_log function:

1. Bug: points of finite order have log 0 and this case should be dealt with at the beginning.  The code breaks on E(0), for example.
2. I deleted the "print_mode" parameter since it was actually changing the output type from p-adic to rational;  callers can lift if they want.
3. The test "if xde == p**(xde.valuation(p))" seems to be wrong.  I changed it to "if x.valuation(p)>=0", which is the condition that P is not in the formal group.
4. It did not multiply P by the Tamagawa exponent.
5. It did not divide the answer by the factor you multiplied the point by! 
6. The precision was artificially capped at 20, since the prec parameter to log() was not used and defaults to 20.  That is the precision of the power series in t, where we will substitute t=-x/y, so I added "prec=1+precision//v"  where v is the valuation of -x/y.  (N.B. in `E^1` one has val(x)=-2*v and val(y)=-3*v for some v>0, so v=val(-x/y).
7. I added some doctests to show that log(k*P)/log(P)==k in various examples.  That is how I discovered the precision problem.  Now it looks pretty good.

The third patch fixes a bug (missed a 2-integral points on 37a1) and makes  `S_integral_x_coords_with_abs_bounded_by()` slightly more efficient, but we are way slower than Magma and I think that the main culprits are that function and  `S_integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coeffs()`.   In the integral points case we made the latter much faster by using real points (since you can tell if a real number is approximately integral) but th analogous thing for S-integral points is more complicated.  Rather than wait, as we are getting the right points (after substantial testing against Magma, for example), I would like this to go in now and we can look into making things faster later.

Details of what is in the 3rd patch:
1. p-adic elliptic log: default precision now 20 not 100, which works fine.  Also converts points to p-adic earlier which avoids dealing with large rationals when the multiplier factor is needed.
2. Calls to p-adic log from S_integral_points() now multiply by the necessary factor after taking logs instead of before: it is a homomorphism, and again this avoinds dealing with larger rationals.
3. Correct use of proof flag (though it is rather crude that when proof==False we just omit the time-consuming call to  S_integral_x_coords_with_abs_bounded_by(abs_bound)).
4. Some speed improvements to S_integral_x_coords_with_abs_bounded_by(), and improved comments including some TODOs.

[Note to Tobias and Michael M: this patch includes the changes in the patch you sent me.]

I have a timing comparison table and will include it here once I have worked out how to do wiki tables.

I keep on thinking of more things which should be done to speed this up.  I'm putting them here so they do not get lost.

p-adic elliptic log:  we call this on several points for each prime, but a lot of the code does not depend on the point (construction of p-adic field, and the formal group, and the series), so this code should be reorganised: this probably means having a new class to store all that stuff.

Hey John,

I'm having a hard time with the latest patch. It does not apply on a fresh clone from 3.2.1 with the patches from ticket 4715 and the 2 others from this ticket.

It gives me:

How long should the long test for ell_rational_field take? I ran it 3h and nothing.

I think my problem is that I had just done a -upgrade to 3.2.2.alpha1 which -- as usual with upgrades -- toally and utterly confused me.  Upgrades leave with with a Sage version which does not match the name of the directory that it is in.

So now I'll try to make it work properly with 3.2.2.alpha2 (not alpha1) and while I am at it, combine those 3 little patches into one.

Attachment [trac-4741-rebased-fixes.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4741/trac-4741-rebased-fixes.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2008-12-14 11:59:25

I was right: last night's 3 patches were all based on the previous release.  This explains two things:  the kodaira bugs I re-fixed last night had already been fixed, as had the pari_curve precision problem.

So now we have trac-4741-rebased-fixes.patch which (1) replaces the previous 3; (2) is properly based on 3.2.2.alpha2; (3) improves on the earlier fixes by handling the p-adic precision more intelligently (it uses try/except, first trying p-adci precision 20 and doubling if that fails).

I tried the patch on a new clone of 3.2.2.alpha2.  To recap, apply these three patches in this order and ignore the others:
1. trac-4741-rebase.patch
2. trac-4741-doctest.patch
3. trac-4741-rebased-fixes.patch
and you should find that all doctests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves pass, and that for all database curves to conductor 2000 of rank>1 E.S_integral_points([2,3,5]) works fine.

Applying 

1. trac-4741-rebase.patch
2. trac-4741-doctest.patch
3. trac-4741-rebased-fixes.patch

leads to a working Sage as well as passing doctests.

William: I assume you want to give this the final positive review once you poke around a little more.

REFEREE REPORT:

```

ZeroDivisionError: cannot divide by zero

This is the loop that got it:

```

    if E.rank() == 2:
        print E.cremona_label(), E.S_integral_points([13]+[E.conductor().factor()[0][0]])

Attachment [trac-4741-padic.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4741/trac-4741-padic.patch) by @JohnCremona created at 2008-12-14 22:11:36

Various p-adic precision bandaids applied, so that William's loop now runs up to this one:

sage: EllipticCurve("7690e1").S_integral_points([13,2])

at which point there's an error raised deep in the p-adic code.  I can't deal with that now, so someone will have to make a judgement about whether this is now "good enough".

Working with p-adics is an acquired skill which I'm not sure I have enough of -- perhaps we need reinforcements?  For example, you cannot just do E.change_ring(Qp(p,precision)) for E an elliptic curve over Q, since an error will be raised if the precision is too low (only of p is a prime of bad reduction I think, so one should be able to work out the necessary precision).

Tobias and Michael, the try/except I put in around line 5077 of ell_rational_field.py was not fully thought through, perhaps that is something you should look into?

Thanks for the encouragement, Michael!

The second issue is then the S_integral points code itself, where I had one difficulty.  I'll recover the curve which caused that and send it to tnagel.

I am OK with merging the code as is now, as long as a "NOTE:" is added to the docstring for S_integral_points (etc.) that it is known to fail on some input, with a pointer to the appropriate trac ticket.  I much prefer that to the Ma* approach of "there are no bugs here" approach, where one lets the user discover bugs.

So "positive review" modulo adding such a note.
