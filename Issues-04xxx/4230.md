At the moment, Sage uses Maxima to compute the Bessel Y function.  This is slow and works only with the default 53 bits of precision.  It would be fairly easy to implement this:

* for integer values of the order nu, use the mpfr yn function
* for non-integer values of nu, use the formula $Y_nu(z) = (J_nu(z)*cos(nu*pi) - J_{-nu}(z))/sin(nu*pi)$, where J is the Bessel J function.

It would also be nice to be able to evaluate Bessel functions with complex, or at least purely imaginary, arguments.

See #3426 (and review it!) for the Bessel functions other than Y.  The code computes values at arbitrary complex coefficients.

Now that mpmath is included in Sage, why not just use mpmath's Bessel functions? http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/bessel.html

They seem to be very well-implemented, work to arbitrary precision, take complex arguments, and so on. Is this a good idea?
