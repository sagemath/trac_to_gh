At the moment, Sage uses Maxima to compute the Bessel Y function.  This is slow and works only with the default 53 bits of precision.  It would be fairly easy to implement this:

* for integer values of the order nu, use the mpfr yn function
* for non-integer values of nu, use the formula $Y_nu(z) = (J_nu(z)*cos(nu*pi) - J_{-nu}(z))/sin(nu*pi)$, where J is the Bessel J function.

Now that mpmath is included in Sage, why not just use mpmath's Bessel functions? http://mpmath.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/build/functions/bessel.html

They seem to be very well-implemented, work to arbitrary precision, take complex arguments, and so on. Is this a good idea?
