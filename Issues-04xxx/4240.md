Right now the doctest coverage of devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py is a pitiful 17%.  Increase this to 100%.   This will involving adding about 59 doctests and docstrings.  See also #4231, which adds two docstrings/doctests.

Hi,

several issues.
On the one hand, the first patch does not apply cleanly against 3.1.3 alpha series, since the hunk in gap.py does not fit (the "prompt" funtion to be removed did get a doctest, so the automatism breaks).
More severely, there are invalid absolute paths in beginning with "/home/wstein/", specific to your local install, see what I get:

```

The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/magma.py

```

The path issues should go away with some triple dots.

However, I have no idea yet what that last "Groebner" issue is (Expected: 2; Got: 0).

My Magma install says: "Magma V2.14-9", what does yours say?

Cheers,

Ah,

we try to load a package, that can't be found.
This does not go away just using triple dots in paths, instead some environment variable magic has to be used, but might explain the Groebner thing.

> not apply cleanly against 3.1.3 alpha 

It's against 3.1.2.

Regarding the Groebner output, I think you didn't apply all the patches, since you have

```
sage: magma.get_verbose("Groebner")
```
in your log above, but the input line should be

```
sage: magma.get_verbose("Groebner")        # optional
```

In particular, you are doing

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/magma.py
```
which with the third patch above should essentially do almost nothing, since
you forgot to put --optional.


Regarding
> we try to load a package, that can't be found. This does not go away 
> just using triple dots in paths, instead some environment variable magic

It is unrelated to Groebner.  This will go away by putting in some ...'s.

I fixed all the problems and a trivial reviewer patch is coming up. I did delete two hunks from the part3 patch since it contained fixes already done independently due to a previous patch. Tests pass with and without optional except two failures due to using Magma 2.13 instead of 2.14 on the test machine, but I can live with that:

```
sage -t -long -optional devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py

    sage: print M2
Expected:
    Space of modular forms on Gamma_1(5) with character $.1, weight 2, and dimension 2 over Integer Ring.
Got:
    Space of modular forms on Gamma_1(5) with character all conjugates of [$.1], weight 2, and dimension 2 over Integer Ring.
