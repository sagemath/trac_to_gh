This follows on from #4536:

1. New invertible_residues() iterator for iterating though only the invertible residues modulo an integral ideal.
2. New function like pari's add_to_1 so that A.add_to_1(B) return a in A such that 1-a is in B.  (The name of this might change before we upload a patch).

Patch to follows later today.

we will probably not merge an aweful lot of patches into 3.3 before all the ReST patches go in.

That's fine, I knew that and meant to put 3.4 on it.

I agree that the more general function David suggests is useful, and it is also very easy to write:  set D=I+J, write 1=x+y with x in I/D, y in J/D using the function here, then for any d in D we have d=(dx)+(dy) with the factors in I,J.

On the other hand implementing this directly using the method we already use would perhaps be more efficient.  So let's not hold this up for that.

On the docstring comment -- yes, and the same is true for very many patches in there now!

The patches for the ReST transition will be rebased post Sage 3.3.x, so no need to worry about that now. One of the goals of SD 12 is to get every patch that is ready into 3.3.x (where x probably is equal to 1).
