  File "/home/was/build/sage-3.2.2.alpha0/local/bin/sage-update", line 178, in do_update
    if 'Placeholder spkg file' in open(F).readline():
IOError: [Errno 21] Is a directory
Error getting new packages!
was@sage:~/build/sage-3.2.2.alpha0$ 
```

Also, later it would try to move the directory out of the way, which will fail.
