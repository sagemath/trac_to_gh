Currently, the section in the tutorial on solving equations refers only to analytical solutions, which are found using "solve()."  When solve fails, it may be worth using a numerical solution.  

For equations with a single variable, this can be done using find_root().  It will save new users time to find "find_root()" mentioned with "solve()" in the section on solving equations.

Examples:

Examples:

```
var('theta')
solve(theta^2 + 1==4)
solve(cos(theta)==sin(theta))
find_root(cos(theta)==sin(theta),0,pi/2)
pi.n()/4
```
