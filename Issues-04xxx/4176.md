Spkg looks good to me, i.e. changes to SPKG.txt and so on. The only change I did was to update 

* patches/setupext.py.diff

to reflect the fixes done by William to setupext.py. I always check the diff in between src and patches since that makes applying fixes from our end to upstream somewhat easier once we upgrade an spkg.
