Spkg looks good to me, i.e. changes to SPKG.txt and so on. The only change I did was to update 

* patches/setupext.py.diff

to reflect the fixes done by William to setupext.py. I always check the diff in between src and patches since that makes applying fixes from our end to upstream somewhat easier once we upgrade an spkg. 

Cheers,

The fix should obviously go upstream. I have a FreeBSD 7 build fix that I will submit in the not too distant future. I will also send this patch upstream then.
