This was reported by William Stein at #4106:

  I did notice this unfortunate property of the `_polynomial_` function that is used
  to implement this patch, namely it does something dumb when given x+y as input: 

  ```
  sage: var('x')
  x
  sage: var('y')
  y
  sage: S = PolynomialRing(Integers(4),1,'x')
  sage: S(x+y)
  2*x
  sage: (x+y)._polynomial_(S)
  2*x
  ```

  I think in this case it should raise a TypeError.
