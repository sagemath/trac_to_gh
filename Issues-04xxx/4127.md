The build process isn't very robust, and occasionally links to unintended libraries from e.g. /sw and /opt.  These scripts are good for detecting when and where that happens.  (OS X only)

First, construct a whitelist on a OS X-and-Sage vanilla installation.  (Run the script from SAGE_ROOT after sourcing sage-env.)

```/usr/bin/env python

# Run this script on a vanilla sage build on a clean OS X to figure out 
# what external libraries vanilla sage links to.  This forms a reference
# for figuring out build problems with non-vanilla configurations.
# dphilp 15/9/8

import os
import re

SAGE_ROOT=os.environ.get('SAGE_ROOT')

# We are building a list of known good external libraries
whitelist = []

# Find all binaries that could be pulling in external libraries
binary_list = os.popen('find . -name *.so -or -name *.dylib').readlines()

# For removing the trailing (compatiblity version .....) stuff
brace_pattern = re.compile('\(.*\)')
def trim_linked_file(x) :
  return re.sub(brace_pattern, '', x).strip()

# For identifying relative file paths, or absolute paths that refer to things
# inside SAGE_ROOT
nonlocal_file_pattern = re.compile('^(?!'+SAGE_ROOT+')/')

for file in binary_list :
  binary_name = file.strip()
  # Find what the binary links to
  linked_file_list = os.popen('otool -L ' + binary_name).readlines()
  # Strip whitespace, and ignore first result (it's the binary name)
  linked_file_list = [i.strip() for i in linked_file_list[1:]]
  for linked_file in linked_file_list :
    # Just get the file name
    linked_name = trim_linked_file(linked_file)
    # If it's not a local file, and not already known, give an error message
    if re.match(nonlocal_file_pattern, linked_name) and not(linked_name in whitelist):
      whitelist.append(linked_name)

whitelist.sort()
whitelist = [ i + '\n' for i in whitelist]
WHITELIST_FILE = open('tmp/linked_file_whitelist.txt', 'w')
WHITELIST_FILE.writelines(whitelist)
```

Second, copy the whitelist to the non-vanilla configuration.

Third, run this script from non-vanilla SAGE_ROOT:

```/usr/bin/env python

# Identify any external (non-sage) libraries that are linked by
# sage binaries, that are not on the 'known good' whitelist.
# dphilp 15/9/8

import os
import re

SAGE_ROOT=os.environ.get('SAGE_ROOT')

# List of non-local files we're allowed to link to
whitelist = open('tmp/linked_file_whitelist.txt').readlines()
whitelist = [i.strip() for i in whitelist]

# Find all binaries that could be pulling in naughty libraries
binary_list = os.popen('find . -name *.so -or -name *.dylib').readlines()

# For removing the trailing (compatiblity version .....) stuff
brace_pattern = re.compile('\(.*\)')
def trim_linked_file(x) :
  return re.sub(brace_pattern, '', x).strip()

# For identifying relative file paths, or absolute paths that refer to things
# inside SAGE_ROOT
nonlocal_file_pattern = re.compile('^(?!'+SAGE_ROOT+')/')

for file in binary_list :
  binary_name = file.strip()
  # Find what the binary links to
  linked_file_list = os.popen('otool -L ' + binary_name).readlines()
  # Strip whitespace, and ignore first result (it's the binary name)
  linked_file_list = [i.strip() for i in linked_file_list[1:]]
  for linked_file in linked_file_list :
    # Just get the file name
    linked_name = trim_linked_file(linked_file)
    # If it's not a local file, and not already known, give an error message
    if re.match(nonlocal_file_pattern, linked_name) and not(linked_name in whitelist):
      print binary_name + ' links to non-whitelisted file ' + linked_name
```
