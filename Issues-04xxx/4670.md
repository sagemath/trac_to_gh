Calling the primepi function on a large pari integer (`10^10)` causes an error.  The issue is that in sage/libs/pari/gen.pyx the function init_primes casts the input to an unsigned long.  If we don't want to allow initialization with input bigger than this, we should give a better error.

Andrew Ohana's optimized Legendre prime_pi fixes this error.  The attached patch adds prime_pi(10**10) to the doctests of Andrew's code.  It may still be desired to give a better error in the PARI implementation.
