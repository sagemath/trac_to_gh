Hi,

this is some laundry list of things and should be first discussed on sage-devel before opening clearly defined tickets. Trac is not a discussion forum :)

Invalid.

 Things are different in notebook and console:
 
 * Because of underline trick, in notebook headings in docstring consists of only underline!
-* Source display in console would look better with additional new line char and one empty line after source output and before "Constructor Docstring", the docstring in console is better, underline trick works as expected, but there could also be one empty line before "Constructor Docstring"
-  * btw - is Constructor Docstring really needed? I think the source is enough and we don't have to include same docstring for every R function, it's already available as docstring for r interpreter itself... it's not included in docstring in notebook so I guess we could live without it, if it is the case, no need to add empty line before it!
