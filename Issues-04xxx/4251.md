This was reported to by a new user:

Section 2.2 Microsoft Windows in the 
Installation Guide seems to have a dead line.
Maybe 
"http://www.sagemath.org/SAGEbin/vmware/"
should be 
"http://www.sagemath.org/download.html"?

I'm not sure what milestone to assign this nor how to
submit a patch since we are in the process of 
switching the documentation over to a new system.


```
Dear David,
  I went to your first link, went to Windows version, at page:
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/inst/node4.html

where the first link is dead: http://www.sagemath.org/SAGEbin/vmware/

But I got the vmware download through some other path (that I don't remember
right now).
        Mark

Yes.
The installation document
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/inst/inst.html

discusses installation and the tutorial
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tut/tut.html

and constructions document
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/const/const.html

have lots of examples.

Let me know if you need help.

David,

feel free to post a patch to fix the issue with the current TeX based documentation. All fixes are also applied (manually) to the ReST tree and while that is likely to come soon I would not hold off on fairly localizes fixes like the above. I would not start a major rewrite of the documentation ;)

Cheers,

Michael

The patch looks good to me, but I couldn't get it to apply, I think because the relevant lines contain "\SAGE" instead of "SAGE".  I'm attaching a slightly modified patch, which should be used instead.  With that, positive review.
