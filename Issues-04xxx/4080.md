# Issue 4080: Symbol clash between global M4RI and PolyBoRi's M4RI

PolyBoRi uses its own M4RI instance which is older than the version of M4RI which is going to be in Sage 3.1.2. Since M4RI is written in C there are no namespaces and thus the symbols clash, even though both versions are binary incompatible. A workaround for now -- until PolyBoRi is updated -- is to delay the import of `sage.rings.pbring` after the import of `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense`. Since PolyBoRi is statically linked for now anyway, this shouldn't mess up things. However **this is a dirty workaround**

btw. this patch can remain applied and does not need to be reverted once the issue at hand is fixed. This is, because it is a good idea to late import more stuff anyway.
