PolyBoRi uses its own M4RI instance which is older than the version of M4RI which is going to be in Sage 3.1.2. Since M4RI is written in C there are no namespaces and thus the symbols clash, even though both versions are binary incompatible. A workaround for now -- until PolyBoRi is updated -- is to delay the import of `sage.rings.pbring` after the import of `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense`. Since PolyBoRi is statically linked for now anyway, this shouldn't mess up things. However **this is a dirty workaround**
