This is because matplotlib doesn't like the Sage Integer 72.  If you change the 72 to int(72), then things work.  We should probably write an email to the matplotlib mailing list asking them how hard it would be to make it play nicely with Sage types.

We also encounter similar issues with numpy and scipy.

This now works, given #5448 (and possibly earlier).

```
sage: import pylab
sage: x1 = srange(0,1.1,0.01)
sage: d1 = [2*x+x^2 for x in x1]
sage: pylab.clf() # clear the figure first
sage: pylab.figure(1)
<matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x16d41d0>

Don't close this.

Something really, really weird is going on.

In a fresh Sage session (not even in the notebook, just in a Sage console session), running the following (simplified from above) code produces png that is cut off which is about 12K:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy
plt.figure()
plt.plot(numpy.arange(0,1.1,0.01))
plt.savefig('foo.png',dpi=72) # fire!
```

However, immediately saving the figure again using `plt.savefig('foo.png',dpi=72)` writes a 13K file which is not cut off.

Doing the same test with sage -python yields the correct figure the first time.  Doing the same test with the system python yields the correct figure the first time.  This is with the matplotlib 0.99.1 spkg installed.

according to the matplotlib-users discussion, the issue arises because the file is not flushed before being closed.  This patch correctly opens, writes and most importantly flush the file before closing.

The bug still appears to exist upstream.
