To release manager:
This now works, given #5448 (and possibly earlier).

```
sage: import pylab
sage: x1 = srange(0,1.1,0.01)
sage: d1 = [2*x+x^2 for x in x1]
sage: pylab.clf() # clear the figure first
sage: pylab.figure(1)
<matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x16d41d0>
sage: pylab.plot(x1,d1, label="d1")
[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x102ceb0>]
sage: pylab.ylabel("$f(x)$") # label the axes
<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x4413f0>
sage: pylab.xlabel("$x$")
<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x1038890>
sage: pylab.savefig('foo.png',dpi=72)
```
foo.png is attached.

Don't close this.

Something really, really weird is going on.

In a fresh Sage session (not even in the notebook, just in a Sage console session), running the following (simplified from above) code produces png that is cut off which is about 12K:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy
plt.figure()
plt.plot(numpy.arange(0,1.1,0.01))
plt.savefig('foo.png',dpi=72) # fire!
```

However, immediately saving the figure again using `plt.savefig('foo.png',dpi=72)` writes a 13K file which is not cut off.

Doing the same test with sage -python yields the correct figure the first time.  Doing the same test with the system python yields the correct figure the first time.  This is with the matplotlib 0.99.1 spkg installed.
