This is a patch which incorporates several changes in linear_codes.py which should speed up (and in some cases do:-) some coding theory computations considerably. It adds interfaces to Cython and C functions of Robert Miller, CJ Tjhal, and Jeffery Leon. 
Speed up of minimum_distance (for codes over GF(2) and GF(3)), the spectrum (=weight_distribution), and permutation_automorphism_group are expected and in most cases achieved. (Also a new function is_permutation_equivalent was added, which interfaces with Robert Miller's double coset partition refinement code.) 

A few points that the referee might want to look at in particular. 
(1) At least one of the functions (code2leon) opens, reads and writes, and closes files. I think I did it correctly, but I read keeping files open is a bad thing, so I hope it was done correctly.
(2) There is a ridiculously slow line which lists the codewords of a given weight. For some reason, GAP (and Guava) is much much faster. It occurs in the permutation_automorphism_group and is commented so you can find it easily. Maybe I am creating the list wrong?

In any case, it passes sage -testall and optional methods were added to the problematical methods, so one always has the option of using the fastest method.

David,

I think it's ready to merge except for one thing: When you create a file to be read by Leon's programs (or for any other reason, really), you should be creating it in a temp directory which gets automatically cleaned up.

Another thing: SAGE_ROOT can also easily be accessed and things like

```
rt = commands.getoutput("echo $SAGE_ROOT")
```
are bad. Another thing is the hard coding of the executable name since one has to append ".exe" on Cygwin for example.

Thanks for all these great comments. 
I have had the patch ready for a day or so now but am having trouble with the process. Problem: I run sage -t on linear_codes.py and code_constructions.py. They pass. sage -testall fails every time with this:

```

I cannot figure this one out.

Any ideas?

The new patch is rebased on 3.2.alpha0 and does not (I'm pretty sure) depend on the other patch.

I am not really sure we want to support this code as long as it seemingly does not work correctly, i.e. smashing the stack and heaps of memory errors do not really bode well for that code. IIRC the code has been GPLed and sooner or later the code by rlm will cover most of the functionality, so I would highly recommend that we dump wtdist as soon as possible unless someone fixes it.

Hi David,

One more thing to fix after all: code2leon creates the file "output" into the cwd:

```
sage: open("output").close()
```
I will take another look to make sure there is no other case like that and then this can go in. Doctests pass for me.
