This is a patch which incorporates several changes in linear_codes.py which should speed up (and in some cases do:-) some coding theory computations considerably. It adds interfaces to Cython and C functions of Robert Miller, CJ Tjhal, and Jeffery Leon. 
Speed up of minimum_distance (for codes over GF(2) and GF(3)), the spectrum (=weight_distribution), and permutation_automorphism_group are expected and in most cases achieved. (Also a new function is_permutation_equivalent was added, which interfaces with Robert Miller's double coset partition refinement code.) 

A few points that the referee might want to look at in particular. 
(1) At least one of the functions (code2leon) opens, reads and writes, and closes files. I think I did it correctly, but I read keeping files open is a bad thing, so I hope it was done correctly.
(2) There is a ridiculously slow line which lists the codewords of a given weight. For some reason, GAP (and Guava) is much much faster. It occurs in the permutation_automorphism_group and is commented so you can find it easily. Maybe I am creating the list wrong?

In any case, it passes sage -testall and optional methods were added to the problematical methods, so one always has the option of using the fastest method.

Another thing: SAGE_ROOT can also easily be accessed and things like

```
rt = commands.getoutput("echo $SAGE_ROOT")
```
are bad. Another thing is the hard coding of the executable name since one has to append ".exe" on Cygwin for example.

Cheers,

Michael

Thanks for all these great comments. 
I have had the patch ready for a day or so now but am having trouble with the process. Problem: I run sage -t on linear_codes.py and code_constructions.py. They pass. sage -testall fails every time with this:

```
 sage -t  devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py              **********************************************************************
File "/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-3.2.alpha0/tmp/linear_code.py", line 1950:

Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    IndexError: list assignment index out of range
**********************************************************************
```
I cannot figure this one out.

Any ideas?

The new patch is rebased on 3.2.alpha0 and does not (I'm pretty sure) depend on the other patch.

I wonder if this is somehow because of the fact that if you run the Leon code command wtdist on the command line directly you get "smash stack" and (memory errors resulting in?) traceback messages? This is a known issue (discovered by Robert Miller and Tom Boothby) and I have added a warning line to the docstring.
I don't understand when this does not arise for sage -t and does for sage -testall though, so easily could be completely wrong.

Has anyone seen this kind of behaviour before?

Replying to [wdj](#comment%3A6):
> I wonder if this is somehow because of the fact that if you run the Leon code command wtdist on the command line directly you get "smash stack" and (memory errors resulting in?) traceback messages?


I am not really sure we want to support this code as long as it seemingly does not work correctly, i.e. smashing the stack and heaps of memory errors do not really bode well for that code. IIRC the code has been GPLed and sooner or later the code by rlm will cover most of the functionality, so I would highly recommend that we dump wtdist as soon as possible unless someone fixes it.

Cheers,

Michael

Hi David,

One more thing to fix after all: code2leon creates the file "output" into the cwd:

```
sage: open("output").close()
```
I will take another look to make sure there is no other case like that and then this can go in. Doctests pass for me.

Sorry for the tardy review :(
