If one types in
`EllipticCurve(1,2)`
then one gets

`Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + 5181*x - 5965058 over Rational Field`

this seemingly unrelated curve has j-invariant 1 and the 2 is ignored. Could the EllipticCurve function test for the presence of two numerical inputs and either raise an error or cast it to
`EllipticCurve([1,2])`?

This should be an easy fix.

I think raising an error is the most consistent thing to do.

Positive review. I notice there is no doctest for EllipticCurve(j). It would be good to add one.
Also the doc is inconsistent wrt 'Returns' vs 'Return'.

This trac and the last comment is linked to the old Ticket #128.
As noted there, we should remove `EllipticCurve(j)` from the possible ways of defining an elliptic curve anyway.
