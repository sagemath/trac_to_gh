```
If one types in
`EllipticCurve(1,2)`
then one gets

`Elliptic Curve defined by y^2  = x^3 + 5181*x - 5965058 over Rational Field`

this seemingly unrelated curve has j-invariant 1 and the 2 is ignored. Could the EllipticCurve function test for the presence of two numerical inputs and either raise an error or cast it to
`EllipticCurve([1,2])`?

Positive review. I notice there is no doctest for EllipticCurve(j). It would be good to add one.
Also the doc is inconsistent wrt 'Returns' vs 'Return'.
