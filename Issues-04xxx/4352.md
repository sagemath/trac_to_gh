This should be pretty straightforward.

sage-support request from Ursula Whitcher:
I asked Anders Jensen, "I would like to compute the weight vectors
corresponding to each reduced Groebner basis in gfan's output.  Is
there a way to tell gfan to do this?"

He replied:

"There is a command "weightvector" that does exactly this. The command
is hidden (does not show up in the manual or the file system). To run
it type "gfan _weightvector" in your shell. MIND THE SPACE BEFORE '_'.
According to the --help text the correct thing to do would be to run
"gfan _weightvector -m" with the gfan output as input.

For example
gfan | gfan _weightvector -m
Q[x,y]
{x-y}

will produce a list of two vectors.
I hope this works out for you.
Best regards,
Anders"

Is there a way to access the weightvector command from the Sage
implementation of gfan?

Thanks!
Ursula

REVIEW:

patch applies and passes test.  Code raises major red flag!!

```
	        ans = eval(ans.replace('{','').replace('}','').replace('\n','')) 
```

If the output -- which you make into vectors over QQ ever actually has any rational numbers, then eval will do very bad things to them, e.g., 

```
sage: eval('2/3')
0
```
Oops!

Use sage_eval instead:

```
sage: sage_eval('2/3')
2/3
```
