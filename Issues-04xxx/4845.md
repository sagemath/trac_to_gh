I think the title says it all -- sage seems to crash on start whenever the file `~/.sage/init.sage` is present, at least on my Mac. The attached patch fixes the issue.

I'm listing this as a blocker, partially because the fix is so short. I think that this bug has been lurking quite a while -- I think it was the fix for #4792 that exposed it ...

I definitely prefer the v2 patch for the sake of readability. For the sake of it, though, should anyone look at this ticket, I want to note that the original patch seems (at a quick glance, anyway) to be faster:

```
sage: s = ""
sage: %timeit s.startswith('3')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 350 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s and s[0] == '3'
10000000 loops, best of 3: 72.2 ns per loop

sage: s = "345"
sage: %timeit s.startswith('3')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 353 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s and s[0] == '3'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 208 ns per loop

sage: s = "678"
sage: %timeit s.startswith('3')
1000000 loops, best of 3: 351 ns per loop
sage: %timeit s and s[0] == '3'
1000000 loops, best of 3: 212 ns per loop
```
