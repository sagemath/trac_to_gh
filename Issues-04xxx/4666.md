The buildbots are using a script (originally written by William and edited by me) to produce the binaries.  It automatically builds a "Mac App" on OS X and chooses a meaningful name for the binary.

Some version of this script should be added to Sage itself, I propose to call it `sage-autobdist`.  Then `sage-bdist` can handle the low-level stuff of actually building the binary.

I'm adding the script as reference, but it needs some work to integrate it in Sage.
