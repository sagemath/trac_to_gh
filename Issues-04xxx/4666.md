The buildbots are using a script (originally written by William and edited by me) to produce the binaries.  It automatically builds a "Mac App" on OS X and chooses a meaningful name for the binary.

Some version of this script should be added to Sage itself, I propose to call it `sage-autobdist`.  Then `sage-bdist` can handle the low-level stuff of actually building the binary.

I'm adding the script as reference, but it needs some work to integrate it in Sage.

 On OSX use uname to specify OSX release, CPU architecture and 32 vs. 64 bit builds.
 
+On other systems as they become officially supported we should use the best local identification tools available or also fall back to uname.
