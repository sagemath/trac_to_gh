sage: An error occurred while installing dvipng-1.8
Please email sage-devel http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel
explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /usr/local/sage/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to
/usr/local/sage/spkg/build/dvipng-1.8 and type 'make'.
Instead type "/usr/local/sage/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/usr/local/sage/spkg/build/dvipng-1.8
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)
```

I installed  libkpathsea-dev in order to get as far as the above:

```
root@sage:/usr/local/sage# apt-get install libkpathsea-dev
```
