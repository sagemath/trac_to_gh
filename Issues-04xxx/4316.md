If I type

```
%html some math: $x<y$.
```
in the notebook, then the "<y" gets swallowed. (If I "Edit" the worksheet, I see

```
<html><font color='black'>some math: <span class="math">x<y</span>.</font></html>
```
but in the worksheet view I see "some math: x.")

Putting a space between "<" and "y" fixes the problem. Also,

```
%html some math: $x<6y$.
``` 
works just fine, and the same with $x<-y$ and similar things; the problem seems to just be with "<" followed by a letter.  The greater than sign seems to present no problems.

Is this related to (or the same problem as) #4245?

Keywords: **notebook, %html**
