There were a few duplicate entries in  `module_list.py`, which didn't cause any trouble, but caused sage to build some extensions (like `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx`) multiple times during the build. The attached patch alphabetizes the module list, and removes duplicates.

**Attachment:** [trac_4661.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4661/trac_4661.patch)

I just posted Craig's patch that he gave to me off-trac. I did nuke the build directory and a sage -ba followed by a -t -long passed, so positive review.

Some commented out extensions might have to be nuked, but that ought to get taken care of via the followup ticket #4663.

Cheers,

Michael
