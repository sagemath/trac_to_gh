Okay, I updated all the docstrings; all tests pass.

My one concern is that in sage/rings/polynomial/real_roots.pyx, I tried to use the new cython buffer interface, but at compile-time, I got a maximum recursion depth exceeded error in the find_buffer_type function (I think that was the name).  Right now, real_roots uses the slow standard python `__getitem__` method.

Either the Cython buffer issue should be fixed or we should make the real_roots access the vector in a faster way (preferably using the numpy C API or exposing that with, say, a get_unsafe_python function in the vector_double_dense file).

This patch made it compile and all the doctests pass.

Can we get this patch (or an equivalent one) into Sage as soon as possible?

I updated the patch to address a doctest failure.  The updated patch now passes doctests in sage/modules/*.(py|pyx) and also passes doctests in sage/structure/sage_object.pyx.

This should be ready to be reviewed again.

The only patch you need to apply is vector-RDF-CDF-numpy-sage-3.2.1.patch to sage 3.2.1.

To review this patch, you need to delete the real_double_vector.* and complex_double_vector.* files out of sage/build/ directories.  One way to do this is:

cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build
find . | grep real_double_vector | xargs rm
find . | grep complex_double_vector | xargs rm

Then do sage -br after applying the patch.  Then you should be ready to test the patch.

Jason asked me to look in particular at the real_roots.pyx parts of this patch, so I did:

The changes to real_roots.pyx look good.  Also, I ran a couple of my standard benchmarks, and the pre- and post-patch timings are not measurably different.

Positive review for real_roots.pyx portion of the patch.

{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:38\" align=\"right\">comment:38</div>\n\nOverall the design looks good to me and the interface with numpy looks good. A few things I noticed. \n\n1. For large arrays around a million, object creation is ever so slightly slower than the old class it seems, I'm guessing thats numpy's falt, there is maybe nothing you can do about that.\n\n\n2. More seriously the fft function is quite a bit slower. \nFor example it takes about 15 seconds to do fft on a vector of lenth a million. Scipy only takes 0.72 to do the fft, and the old class also only took about a second. I'll look and see if I have any suggestions about the bottle neck, this probably should be fixed. It seemed most other operations were about the same speed but it might be good to double check this. \n\n3. One suggestion, I think it would cool if in vector_double_dense.pxd you make the _vector_numpy array public as in\n\n```\ncdef public cnumpy.ndarray _vector_numpy\n```\nthen it is possible to do something like\n\n```\nv=vector(RDF,[1,2,3])\nv._vector_numpy[0]=3\n```\nthis could be useful to pass something to scipy without having to copy.

Overall the design looks good to me and the interface with numpy looks good. A few things I noticed. 

1. For large arrays around a million, object creation is ever so slightly slower than the old class it seems, I'm guessing thats numpy's falt, there is maybe nothing you can do about that.


2. More seriously the fft function is quite a bit slower. 
For example it takes about 15 seconds to do fft on a vector of lenth a million. Scipy only takes 0.72 to do the fft, and the old class also only took about a second. I'll look and see if I have any suggestions about the bottle neck, this probably should be fixed. It seemed most other operations were about the same speed but it might be good to double check this. 

3. One suggestion, I think it would cool if in vector_double_dense.pxd you make the _vector_numpy array public as in

```
cdef public cnumpy.ndarray _vector_numpy
```
then it is possible to do something like

```
v=vector(RDF,[1,2,3])
v._vector_numpy[0]=3
```
this could be useful to pass something to scipy without having to copy. You could make it readonly instead of public if you don't want people to be able to modify through that mechanism.

Why don't we use scipy to do the fft, then?

This is a little puzzling since the code *does* use scipy to do fft.  Here is the relevant call:

```
            return v._new(scipy.fft(v._vector_numpy))
```

The thing that I see is that above this, I do:

```
        cdef Vector_double_dense v = self.complex_vector()
```

I think the wasted time is in one of those two calls.  I can look at this later.

I changed the behavior of the fft function in the vector_fft patch.  It now does a complex fft over a CDF vector, but a *real* fft over an RDF vector.  I also streamlined it, so now we get the following timings (after the patch):


```
sage: v=vector(RDF, range(1000000r))
sage: n=v.numpy()
sage: import scipy; import scipy.fftpack
sage: timeit('a=v.fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 96.8 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fftpack.rfft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 98.3 ms per loop
sage: timeit('a=v.inv_fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 106 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fftpack.irfft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 106 ms per loop
sage: v=vector(CDF, range(1000000r))
sage: n=v.numpy()
sage: timeit('a=v.fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 182 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fftpack.fft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 181 ms per loop
sage: timeit('a=v.inv_fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 207 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fftpack.ifft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 207 ms per loop
```

Since the behavior of the fft function is changed, I'm putting this as "needs review".  What I'm looking for is someone to pass off on the use of the real fft for RDF vectors.

On IRC, we decided to instead follow the convention in matlab and return a complex vector (and do a complex fft), even if we start out with a real vector.

So I'll make that change and then consider this a positive review (since then the functionality won't have changed, but the timing will still be good).

Okay, updated the vector_fft.patch. The new timing comparison is:

```
sage: v=vector(RDF, range(1000000r))
n=v.numpy()
sage: n=v.numpy()
sage: import scipy; import scipy.fftpack
sage: timeit('a=v.fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 342 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 316 ms per loop
sage: timeit('a=v.inv_fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 442 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.ifft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 416 ms per loop
sage: v=vector(CDF, range(1000000r))
sage: n=v.numpy()
sage: timeit('a=v.fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 346 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.fft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 319 ms per loop
sage: timeit('a=v.inv_fft()')
5 loops, best of 3: 470 ms per loop
sage: timeit('b=scipy.ifft(n)')
5 loops, best of 3: 419 ms per loop
```

Since the timing issue is addressed, I'm marking this as positive review as directed in jkantor's comment.
