On a system where "root" upgrades incrementally a system-wide Sage installation, and only "normal" users ever run Sage, there might be trouble.

More precisely, the rights to create the "sage-flags.txt" file --- or also the "sage-location.txt" file --- might not be owned by the normal user.

Even if this would be only a corner case, the obvious fix (run "sage-starts" once during sage -upgrade") does not hurt anybody, hence this ticket.

Hmmm,

it's better to call the "sage-location" script directly, because starting Sage as "root" will create certain files/directories (.sage/...) in root's home directory, which is avoidable.

`sage-location` is run when doing `sage --upgrade`.
