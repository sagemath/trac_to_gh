Immediately after building sage from source, the cython files from the sage library aren't in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/build/sage` where they belong. One can see them get copied when doing a `sage -b` or `sage -clone`, but why aren't they there in the first place?

Even stranger -- they get copied over during the build, as one can see in `install.log` ... where do they get deleted?

Unbelievable! But true (I checked older Sage versions, too). I read the ticket while building Sage 3.2.rc0 and had a look. While in the shell where I issued the build it was printing:

```

```
one should assume that then in the following the .pyx files were copied over.

But this was not the case!

In fact, the directory /Users/georgweber/Public/sage/sage-3.2.rc0/devel/sage/build/sage/ was empty (!!!) at that time, and thus the (linked) directory /Users/georgweber/Public/sage/sage-3.2.rc0/local//lib/python/site-packages/sage/ was empty too, i.e. had no subdirectory structure. I wasn't fast enough to create by hand some of the missung directories and see whether then, the .pyx files would be copied over there as the log output shows resp. wants to make us believe, but that might be worth another try.

I do now think the .pyx were not deleted, but were never successfully copied over.

Ahh, I didn't forget a subdirectory level, but forgot to take into account that the directory "build" under "devel/sage" does not exist at that time.

Works fine at my install, please review.

Yeah, the patch2 for the patch is coyote ugly, but does the job.

And probably we don't need anymore to "touch all Cython files" in the next lines after the added ones, but for the time being I let that stand as it is.

This ticket (both patches are needed) is for review now (again).

This will lead to a positive review in the end, I'm sure.

But from past experience, I would like to see with my own eyes the patch passing the necessary tests before I give the "go!". It will take at least several hours, maybe a day, before I can do the testing, because right now I don't have access to a Sage installation.

Maybe someone else is quicker.

Yeah, any patch to the build system gets additional scrutiny since screw ups here affect a lot of people. 

> Maybe someone else is quicker.

I will do a full cycle, i.e. force a complete rebuild after devel/sage-main with the patch applied to the spkg to see what happens, i.e. if a "sage -b" forces a rebuild on all files.

Either way: thanks to both of you of putting this issue down.

Hmm, this blows up (also with the patch from #4480 applied) when doing a virgin build:

```
Installing c_lib
scons: `install' is up to date.
Updating Cython code....
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 435, in <module>
    queue = compile_command_list(ext_modules, deps)
  File "setup.py", line 400, in compile_command_list
    dest_time = deps.timestamp(dest_file)
  File "setup.py", line 244, in timestamp
    self._timestamps[filename] = os.path.getmtime(filename)
  File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.final/local/lib/python2.5/posixpath.py", line 143, in getmtime
    return os.stat(filename).st_mtime
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.final/local//lib/python/site-packages//sage/structure/sage_object.pyx'
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```
Don't let the path names fool you - this is a 3.2.rc0 build.

Cheers,
