I was using SAGE with the small version of the CremonaDatabase, and tried the following, which does not work because the conductor is too high:

```
EllipticCurve("10001a1")
```

I think it would be useful if the error message not only said "this curve is not in the database" (which is indeed true) but also checked to see if one was using the small database of curves, and if so told the user how to access the larger version
using the incantation

```
!sage -i database_cremona_ellcurve-2005.11.03
```
or otherwise.

Component: **elliptic curves**

The patch is ok (so far only tested without the optional package). I will test it with it later today.

Maybe while we are at it I could suggest that the same change is done to `cremona_label()`.
This is without the optional package:

```
sage: E= EllipticCurve([3,10])
sage: E.cremona_label()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

   3305                 X = self.database_curve()
   3306             except RuntimeError:
-> 3307                 raise RuntimeError, "Cremona label not known for %s."%self
   3308             self.__cremona_label = X.__cremona_label
   3309             return self.cremona_label(space)

This patch also works with the optional package. I give this ticket a positive review and I agree that the command-line to install the optional package should better not be included. It is very clear what to do as it is now.

 The second [independent] patch obtains also a positive review with this.

 I propose to address the issue that I raised on `cremona_label()` in a new ticket.

 Chris.
