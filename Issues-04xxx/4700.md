This ticket moves the jsmath, jquery, jqueryui, and jsmath-image-fonts packages to their own spkgs that install in local/notebook/javascript.

Sorry, mabshoff; it was much easier to group these very related and similar tasks together.

The spkgs are at:



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-3.6a.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg

The (huge) patch that deletes things from the extcode repository is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/extcode-remove-javascript-packages.patch (apply to the extcode repository; we might reset the extcode history, as mabshoff suggested on #4267).

This ticket also takes the opportunity to update each of the javascript packages to the latest version (as of late October, 2008).  Some of the changes in the patch reflect the updating (primarily, the updating of jqueryui).

No, 

the whole point was that

1. these tasks are independent
2. this is again a composite ticket just like #4267

So: invalid.

Cheers,

Michael

To elaborate some more why these tickets need to be split up:

* verifying that the updated jsmath.spkg works is trivial
* anything touching jquery needs to be reviewed in much more detail, i.e. somebody needs to check that DSage still works, i.e. its GUI
* jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg is an optional spkg, so it should be trivial to review

Mixing and matching seemingly related tickets and then ending up piling fixes on top has proven a disaster time after time, so let's please be nice about this and get this resolved.

Cheers,

Michael

Okay; I saw all of these tasks as very similar, hence the same ticket.  It'll be a lot more work to split it up further than this, but I'll get to it eventually.
