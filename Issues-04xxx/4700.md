This ticket moves the jsmath, jquery, jqueryui, and jsmath-image-fonts packages to their own spkgs that install in local/notebook/javascript.

Sorry, mabshoff; it was much easier to group these very related and similar tasks together.

The spkgs are at:



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jquery-1.2.6.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jqueryui-1.6r807svn.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-3.6a.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg

The (huge) patch that deletes things from the extcode repository is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/extcode-remove-javascript-packages.patch (apply to the extcode repository; we might reset the extcode history, as mabshoff suggested on #4267).

No, 

the whole point was that

1. these tasks are independent
2. this is again a composite ticket just like #4267

So: invalid.

Cheers,

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

To elaborate some more why these tickets need to be split up:

* verifying that the updated jsmath.spkg works is trivial
* anything touching jquery needs to be reviewed in much more detail, i.e. somebody needs to check that DSage still works, i.e. its GUI
* jsmath-image-fonts-1.3p0.spkg is an optional spkg, so it should be trivial to review

Mixing and matching seemingly related tickets and then ending up piling fixes on top has proven a disaster time after time, so let's please be nice about this and get this resolved.

Cheers,

Michael

Okay; I saw all of these tasks as very similar, hence the same ticket.  It'll be a lot more work to split it up further than this, but I'll get to it eventually.
