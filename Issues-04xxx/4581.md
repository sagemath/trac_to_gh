```
Since PermutationGroupElement accepts Permutations:

```
sage: PermutationGroupElement(Permutation([2,1,3]))
(1,2)
```
it would be good if the other direction worked as well:

```
sage: g = PermutationGroupElement([2,1,3])
sage: g
(1,2)
sage: Permutation(g)
...
ValueError: l must be a list
```
The following works:

```
sage: Permutation(g.list())
[2, 1, 3]
```
