Some additional lines in the html-header enable proper handling of the sage notebook as a "desktop application". There, all elements from the browser UI are removed and it looks like an application with a shortcut on the desktop or start menu. This is probably more widespread used once HTML 5 ideas are used in other browsers as well.

I'll attach nice icons and a text to this ticket.

Implements a "Create Shortcut" link that is displayed in in the "list worksheets" view that is displayed if the user has installed Google Gears.

The images included need to be places in the data/extcode/notebook/images folder and provide the application shortcut image requested by gears.

Now that #3950 is in this one can go in, but we need a rebase:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < trac_4069_shortcut_sage.patch 
patching file sage/server/notebook/notebook.py
Hunk #2 FAILED at 1319.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 1324 (offset -44 lines).
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/server/notebook/notebook.py.rej
```
Once it is rebased it will go in.

Cheers,

Michael
