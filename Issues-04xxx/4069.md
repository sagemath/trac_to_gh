Some additional lines in the html-header enable proper handling of the sage notebook as a "desktop application". There, all elements from the browser UI are removed and it looks like an application with a shortcut on the desktop or start menu. This is probably more widespread used once HTML 5 ideas are used in other browsers as well.

I'll attach nice icons and a text to this ticket.
