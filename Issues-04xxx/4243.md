I updated the package at the address given in the description to correspond to the latest patch added to #4244.

Note that the package will break sage if the patches in #4244 are not applied, since libpynac will complain about missing symbols.

Spkg looks good to me. I read Burcin's changes, but having another expert looks over this wouldn't hurt. Either way: damn the torpedoes :)
