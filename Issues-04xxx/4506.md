The planarity code ignores errors when adding edges.  This patch also shortcuts the planarity checking when adding an edge returns the NONPLANAR code.

It looks good to me. 

Unless one knows how to make the C program fail (out of memory?) I don't see what doctest to add. The result is the same, so I think the existing doctests cover it.
