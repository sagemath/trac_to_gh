Again, I didn't see any errors before, so I can't put in a doctest that didn't work before, but does after the patch.  This is pro-active bugfixing, not reactive bugfixing :).

It looks good to me. 

Unless one knows how to make the C program fail (out of memory?) I don't see what doctest to add. The result is the same, so I think the existing doctests cover it.
