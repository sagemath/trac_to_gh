I don't see what to doctest.  I personally didn't come across any errors, I'm just adding the checking as good programming practice.  As for the shortcut in the nonplanar case, I'm just doing exactly what Boyer does in his C program.  The program gave the correct answers before, now it just doesn't worry about finding a kuratowski subgraph if it is not needed.

Again, I didn't see any errors before, so I can't put in a doctest that didn't work before, but does after the patch.  This is pro-active bugfixing, not reactive bugfixing :).

It looks good to me. 

Unless one knows how to make the C program fail (out of memory?) I don't see what doctest to add. The result is the same, so I think the existing doctests cover it.
