Tim Dokchitser's `gp` script `computel.gp`, which is used internally by `an_numerical`, uses global variables, which is a good reason to use a different `gp` instance for every call.

I first suspected an unnecessary line of code in `Lseries_ell.dokchitser()`, but this was not the cause:

```diff
--- a/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py
+++ b/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/lseries_ell.py
@@ -132,7 +132,6 @@
                        eps = self.__E.root_number(),
                        poles = [],
                        prec = prec)
-        gp = L.gp()
         s = 'e = ellinit(%s);'%list(self.__E.minimal_model().a_invariants())
         s += 'a(k) = ellak(e, k);'
         L.init_coeffs('a(k)', 1, pari_precode = s,
```
This line just starts the `gp` instance a bit sooner than necessary, so I don't think a patch is needed.
