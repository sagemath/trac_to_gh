It seems that this could still come in handy since we will need it for Python 2.6 support for example.

Looks like we need to wait for Scipy 0.7:

I took a look and it looks like the SciPy sparse matrix handling 
has changed quite a bit between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0.  So I'll leave 
it as is and require 0.7.0 for that (small,optional) part of networkx.
