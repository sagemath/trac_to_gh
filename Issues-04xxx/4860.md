It seems that this could still come in handy since we will need it for Python 2.6 support for example.

Proposed upgrade package found here:

http://8tb.us/home/rlmill/networkx-0.99.spkg

Passed long tests in `sage.graphs`, haven't yet tested elsewhere. Someone should check this out, because the pkg doubled in size (although this is 0.36 --> 0.99)

Looks like we need to wait for Scipy 0.7:

I took a look and it looks like the SciPy sparse matrix handling 
has changed quite a bit between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0.  So I'll leave 
it as is and require 0.7.0 for that (small,optional) part of networkx.

AFAIK nothing we do in Sage depends on that (small,optional) part of networkx that requires up-to-date scipy.

On i686 Debian 5.0 Lenny (testing) with kernel 2.6.24-1-686, and Sage 3.2.3, I downloaded the package at 



[http://8tb.us/home/rlmill/networkx-0.99.spkg](http://8tb.us/home/rlmill/networkx-0.99.spkg)



to my machine and installed it with

```
sage -i networkx-0.99.spkg
```
and ran tests with

```
sage -t -long /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs
```
All tests passed.
