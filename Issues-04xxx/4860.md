It seems that this could still come in handy since we will need it for Python 2.6 support for example.

Looks like we need to wait for Scipy 0.7:

I took a look and it looks like the SciPy sparse matrix handling 
has changed quite a bit between 0.6.0 and 0.7.0.  So I'll leave 
it as is and require 0.7.0 for that (small,optional) part of networkx.

On i686 Debian 5.0 Lenny (testing) with kernel 2.6.24-1-686, and Sage 3.2.3, I downloaded the package at 



[http://8tb.us/home/rlmill/networkx-0.99.spkg](http://8tb.us/home/rlmill/networkx-0.99.spkg)



to my machine and installed it with

```
sage -i networkx-0.99.spkg
```
and ran tests with

```
sage -t -long /path/to/SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/sage/graphs
```
All tests passed.
