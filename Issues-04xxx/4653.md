The sage-word project wants to implement a complete package for word manipulation and combinatorics under Sage. The project maintains a [Google code page](http://code.google.com/p/sage-words).

The code has already been merged into sage-combinat, and although it needs a bit of work, it is ready to be merged into Sage. (By "needs a bit of work", I mean that there are some algorithms that need to be improved, but the code greatly improves the rudimentary functionality that exists in Sage.) The code is well documented, and a worksheet highlighting the features of the code can be found here:

* [Sage worksheet](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~saliola/maths/talks/slides/SageTalk2/06_Words.sws)
* [PDF file of worksheet](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~saliola/maths/talks/slides/SageTalk2/06_Words.pdf)

Arnaud Bergeron, Amy Glen, Sébastien Labbé, and Franco Saliola all contributed to the project, so they all deserve credit for this patch.

Good move saliola! I was going to ask what were the objectives before getting the code into sage. I had one :
- Get back to the 100% documentation and coverage we had in sage-word google code. In fact, some functions had been added without doc and/or tests while merging the code in sage-combinat.
- Any other?

Done. I added the missing doctests this evening. It is now at 100% again.

Hi guys,

one issue that might be worth considering now before merging is "name space pollution", i.e. there was some discussion at SD 11 that it would be better to have most of the functionality of certain packages like quadratic forms not in the global namespace. I am not sure what the situation with words is (sorry, no time to apply the patch and play :)), but it would be nice if most of the functionality would be in

```
words.$FOO
```
Sooner or later things will start colliding in the global namespace, so the time to fix this would be pre-merge :)

The all.py file imports only a few things into the global namespace:

```
Alphabet
Word
WordMorphism
WordOptions
Words
words
```
Should we merge them all into the new "words" class? I assume then that a user should be able to do something like the following to load all the commands into the global namespace easily:

```
from words import *
```
or 

```
LoadPackage(words)
```
Is there a standard way of doing this? I.e. a standard way of naming the class that gets imported as words, a standard way of naming the file that contains this class, etc. I think it would be nice if these are decided upon soon because it would make finding them in the source code easy.

Ok, that seems acceptable. But what is the difference between words and Words? I can tell you that there are many people (including William) around in Sage that absolutely dislike case sensitivity behavior changes, i.e. think LinAlg in Maple 10 or so. 

> Should we merge them all into the new "words" class? I assume then that a user should be able to do something like the following to load all the commands into the global namespace easily


As mentioned above five symbols in global namespace is fine. There are other subsystems that are much, much worst in this regard and it will take a while to fix those.

There is no standard way AFAIK, but we might want to come up with one as more and more "libraries" are becoming part of standard Sage.

I really like the idea of putting everything under "words", so that all the functionality is available using tab completion:

```
sage: words.[tab]
words.Alphabet
words.Examples
words.Morphism
words.Word
words.Words
```
Then one can do:

```
sage: words.examples.ThueMorseWord()
``` 
See finance.[tab] for a working example.

I also propose loading Words and Word into the global name space, in which case Words would be an alias for words (so words("ab") is the combinatorial class of all words over "ab").

Since we will want to add a bunch of other objects and not necessarily load them into the global name space (for example: Paths), this might be the best way to proceed.
 
What do you think? Other suggestions? We can also wait to see what the reviewer suggests.

I am seeing two doctest failures, one which could have been caused by my dumb rebase attempt:

sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py # 1 doctests failed

In detail: This might be caused by missing pickles in the pickle jar:
