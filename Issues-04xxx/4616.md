```
This is a method of the Piecewise class (which I use almost on a daily basis in teaching):

```
sage: f1 = lambda x: x*(pi-x)
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,pi),f1]])
sage: f.cosine_series_coefficient(0,pi)
                                               
```
Requires a ctl-c.

Component: **calculus**
