This is a method of the Piecewise class (which I use almost on a daily basis in teaching):

```
sage: f1 = lambda x: x*(pi-x)
sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,pi),f1]])
sage: f.cosine_series_coefficient(0,pi)
                                               
```
Requires a ctl-c.

I can confirm this problem on a box that has no problem with the Sage <-> Maxima communication (I was dubious initially since David has reported problems with Maxima for his recent Sage installs).

I can read the docstring and check in Sage that it is correct. (I did not try to apply it though.)

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: f = Piecewise([[(0,pi),f1]])
sage: f.cosine_series_coefficient(0,pi)

Hope this is sufficient for a positive review.
