Jeffrey reported:

```
I've just downloaded and launched Sage on an Ubuntu 8.10 box.  I 
unzipped the file and ran ./sage and got this: 
  WARNING!  This Sage install was built on a machine that supports 
  instructions that are not available on this computer.  Sage will 
  likely fail with ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION errors! The following processor 
  flags were on the build machine but are not on this computer: 
  nx up 
I downloaded this image of Sage: 
  sage-3.2-ubuntu32bit-intel-i686-Linux.tar.gz 
Is there anything I can do? 
Thanks in advance 
Jeffrey 
```

The problem is that nx for example is a no execute flag and has zero impact on compatibility for binaries. We should only trac sse, sse2 and see3 flags (and potentially others, but I will do some research here.

Cheers,

Michael

Why don't we do it the other way around, i.e. only consider flags we know cause trouble: sse, sse2, sse4 and maybe three or four more. These flags are vectorization flags and are the only ones I am aware of that need consideration. All the other flags are CPU properties that aren't related to instruction sets.
