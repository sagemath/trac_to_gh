Jeffrey reported:

```
I've just downloaded and launched Sage on an Ubuntu 8.10 box.  I 
unzipped the file and ran ./sage and got this: 
  WARNING!  This Sage install was built on a machine that supports 
  instructions that are not available on this computer.  Sage will 
  likely fail with ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION errors! The following processor 
  flags were on the build machine but are not on this computer: 
  nx up 
I downloaded this image of Sage: 
  sage-3.2-ubuntu32bit-intel-i686-Linux.tar.gz 
Is there anything I can do? 
Thanks in advance 
Jeffrey 
```

The problem is that nx for example is a no execute flag and has zero impact on compatibility for binaries. We should only trac sse, sse2 and see3 flags (and potentially others, but I will do some research here.

Cheers,

Michael

Two more flags I would consider:

* pni - prescott new instructions
* cmov - an older instruction present on Pentiums or higher - that might be pushing it, but you never know :)
