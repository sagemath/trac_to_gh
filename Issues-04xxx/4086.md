In spkg-install we touch pbori.pyx to force a rebuild. But when building from a vanilla tarball that file does not exist and spkg-install exists with a non-zero status and fails. The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc2/polybori-0.5rc.p4.spkg

fixes the issue.

Build tested on x86, x86-64 and Itanium Linux as well as OSX.

Cheers,

Michael
