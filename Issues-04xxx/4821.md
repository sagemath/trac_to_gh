I made an experimental scilab-5.0.3.spkg

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/Scilab/scilab-5.0.3.spkg
]

```

Please test it by downloading it into $SAGEROOT
and type

./sage -f -m scilab-5.0.3.spkg

The -m argument keeps the package in the spkg/build directory for
further experimentation.

See spkg-install:
I did a minimal
./configure --without-javasci --without-gui --with-gfortran


There are two dependencies left: pcre and matio

I don't know how essential they are for a full functional scilab :(


```

Cheers,

Jaap


For me it worked on Fedora 9 and Fedora 10

This spkg needs at least to attempt to pick the right Fortran runtime at configure time.

Of course you are right, but I don't know how to do that.

Besides there are other dependencies to be resolved.

What I did on Fedora was cycling .configure and installing missing dependencies.

Not very suited for inclusion in spkg-install :-)!
