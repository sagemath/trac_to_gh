If you know the limitations of get_memory_usage() you can work 
around them. Case in point from 3.2.3 right after startup: 

64 bit linux, i.e. sage.math: 
sage: get_memory_usage() 
668.32421875 
---- 
32 bit OSX 10.5: 
sage: get_memory_usage() 
'131M+' 
---- 
64 bit OSX 10.5: 
sage: get_memory_usage() 
'171M+' 
--- 
32 bit Solaris/Sparc: 
sage: get_memory_usage() 
'81M' 

While there should be a difference between 32 and 64 bit, i.e 64 bit 
code is larger and consumes more memory, the result from Linux is not 
even close to the truth, i.e. I don't think 32 bit Solaris is roughly 
a magnitude more efficient than 64 bit Linux. 
Either way, the result of get_memory_usage() should be consistent 
across platforms and not return a string in some cases and something 
else on Linux. It should be a float of the memory used in MB.
