The patches attached contain various enhancements to the pynac interface:
* variables.patch - adds a .variables() method to sage.symbolic.expression.Expression
* custom_eval_func.patch - allows the user to set custom python functions to perform evaluation, numeric evaluation, derivation, series expansion etc. on the given function (sage.symbolic.function.SFunction).

Changes in custom_eval_func.patch depend on the package at #4243, which in turn depends on #3872.
