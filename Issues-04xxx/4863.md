It is impossible to use the `install_package` command to install pyopenssl-0.6.  See below:

```
sage: install_package('pyopenssl-0.6')
Possible names of non-installed packages starting with 'pyopenssl-0.6':

I verified this error in sage-3.2.2 on Linux and OS X.

No problem for me, at least in sage-3.2.1 on Linux.

So maybe I'll try to upgrade and check again.

Meanwhile I upgraded and removed `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/installed/pyopenssl-0.6` and `SAGE_ROOT/optional/pyopenssl-0.6.spkg`. Then I tried 
`install_package('pyopenssl-0.6')` again. 

There was no problem. So, I can not reproduce the bug.

Still (meanwhile sage-3.2.3 on Linux) I can not reproduce the problem. Doing `install_package('pyopen')` resulted in the installation of pyopenssl, meanwhile in version 0.8.

So, I suggest to resolve the bug as invalid.
