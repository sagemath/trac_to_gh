We have removed the Java binaries required for surf (which is part of Singular). Since there are optional doctests in sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py that depend on it and since people have complained about it not being available we should add it back via an optional spkg.

Cheers,

There is already a surf package so I think this can be closed. The surf package however doesn't build but we have #6316 for this. Putting up for review so someone else can look wether this can be closed.
