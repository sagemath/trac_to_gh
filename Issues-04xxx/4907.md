Looks good. There is one "then" which is caught in a latex math display mode. I wonder if changing

```
 	100	.. math:: 
 	101	 
 	102	     f(x)=1,\ \ \ \ g(x)=x^4+x+1,  
 	103	 
 	104	 then 
```
to

```
 	100	.. math:: 
 	101	 
 	102	     f(x)=1,\ \ \ \ g(x)=x^4+x+1,  
 	103	 
	104	 
 	105	then 
```
would fix that? Ie, add a blank line and delete a space?

Good catch.  Just deleting the space should be enough.  ReST works with indentation levels.  I'll post an updated patch.
