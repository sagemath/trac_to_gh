FLINT uses its own memory pool. In order to clean up Sage's valgrind log call  flint_stack_cleanup() right before unloading FLINT.

This patch does not apply to my tree? I am also curious why this is a git style patch considering that the history is messed up anyway with git style patches:

```
mabshoff@geom:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.3.alpha2/devel/sage$ hg import trac_4840-flint_free.patch 
applying trac_4840-flint_free.patch
unable to find 'sage/libs/flint/flint.pxi' for patching
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/libs/flint/flint.pxi.rej
sage/libs/flint/flint.pxi: No such file or directory
abort: patch failed to apply
```
What is going on here? Does this depend on something else?

Cheers,

Michael
