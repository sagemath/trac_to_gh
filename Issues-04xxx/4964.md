```
Add at first (mollerhansen's) Weil pairing implementation on EC points and in this way laying out a framework for pairings in general. 

In future: 
* this Weil pairing implementation should be replaced by a more effective implementation.
* other pairings could be implemented/wrapped using same framework.

Sorry, that's all I have time for just now.

Yes, I agree - for now the only thing implemented is for points of order n, I check that they both are of order n, which actually will take some time for large n. There is definitely room for improvement here!

Well, it is much slower for large n to do discrete log computations. Wrt. to time complexity then I do not think we can do better since the miller algorithm runs in linear time in the number of bits in the input n.

You're right the above argument should be noted in the code.

I succesfully applied the patch to 3.3.alpha3 and the doctests pass.  But the first example I tried crashed:

```
sage: F.<a>=GF(19^4)
sage: E=EllipticCurve(F,[-1,0])
sage: P,Q=E.gens()
sage: P.order(), Q.order()
(360, 360)
# Check that P and Q really are independent:
sage: linear_relation(P,Q,'+')
(0, 360)
sage: P.weil_pairing(Q,360)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PariError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PariError: impossible inverse modulo:  (36)
```
So pari (which does the underlying field arithmetic) has tried to divide by zero.

The comments in the code suggest that (1) run-time errors only happen when the points are independent, and (2) these are caught.  So here is a counterexample to both.

Is there a typo in the code perhaps?

There was definetly a zero division when computing the slope in case P=Q\neqO in the `_line_` function. Problem was that after refactoring my own code and putting it nicely into sage I forgot the subcase P=Q\neqO x1=x2. So the zero came from the vertical slope not being handled seperatly.

I then tried your test and I wondered why 

```
sage: P.weil_pairing(Q,360).multiplicative_order()
181
sage: P.order()
360
sage: 180*P
(0 : 0 : 1)
```
I will make a bug report on it. 

> Two more comments:  in _miller_(), you should perhaps initialize t to self.base_ring()(1) and not just 1.  Secondly, this code would apply just as well to points of finite order over any field, so you should move the whole block of code so that the functions are members of EllipticCurvePoint_field and not of the sub-class EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field.

I think I will do this in the next iteration together with your suggestion on saving time by precomputing the d=gcd(m1,m2) and doing the pairing of (m1/d)*P and (m2/d)*Q. I'm a bit pressured on time this month and I think that the next iteration will require some more extensive tests.

Attachment: **[trac_4964a.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4964/trac_4964a.patch.gz)**

The revised patch fixes the bug.  I have taken the liberty of adding my patch trac_4964a.patch (to be applied after trac_4964.patch) which does the following:

1. Adds a doctest to show that the bug I reported is fixed.
2.  Moves the functions to the class EllipticCurvePoint_field, as I originally suggested, since this works perfectly well!
3. Illustrate my point in 2 by adding a docest computing a 5th order Weil pairing over the 5th cyclotomic field.
4. Edited the documentation about the implementation only applying when both points have the same order n, since in fact the only condition is that n*P=n*Q=0, i.e. that they are both in E[n], so the function could be applied to any two torsion points provided that n is a common multiple of their orders.

If dmhansen is happy with these adjustments then I am happy with the (combined) patch, so I am optimistically giving it a positive review.  Ideally, a 3rd party would take a look too.
