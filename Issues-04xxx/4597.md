I have an unconfirmed theory as to the cause of the problem.  My theory is that there's a chain like this: A.pyx depends on B.pxd; B.pxd depends on C.pxi.  So setup.py records a transitive dependency of A.pyx on C.pxi.  Then a patch removes C.pxi and modifies B.pxd to not depend on C.pxi any more, but does not touch A.pyx.  Then setup.py checks all the dependencies of A.pyx to see whether to recompile it, but fails when it tries to check the no-longer-existing C.pxi.

Removing .cython_deps allows compilation to proceed.
