Looks good except for the following mostly minor changes:

plot.py, line 990: change 'suming' to 'summing'  (not your fault, an old typo)

line 1141: I think EXAMPLES is indented too far: check the page [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.Graphics.show](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.Graphics.show)

line 1827: `'-' (dashed)` should say `'--' (dashed)`

line 2559: a dash "--" in some text got turned into a hyphen "-"

line 2913: change "increase" to "increases" (the subject of the sentence is "lowering", which is singular) (not your fault)
