The title seems complicated but the problem is easy to see: if one creates a worksheet with an apostrophe in the title, like this:

```
I'm an apostrophe
```
then saves, quits, and reloads the worksheet, the title is now:

```
I&apos;m an apostrophe
```
If you quit and reload the worksheet, the title becomes:

```
I&amp;apos;m an apostrophe
```
...and so on. The ampersand is replaced by "`&amp;`", and then THAT ampersand gets replaced by...and so on. The problem seems to happen with any HTML entity. I'm seeing this with 3.2.2.
