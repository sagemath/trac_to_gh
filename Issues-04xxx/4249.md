```
This is unacceptable (in  my opinion):

```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+23)
sage: K.integral_basis()
[1, 1/2*a + 1/2]
sage: K.ring_of_integers().basis()
[1/2*a + 1/2, a]
```

I think these should be the same.  The problem is that K.integral_basis() gets the basis from pari, but when the ring_of_integers is constructed it uses that basis in the constructions but then creates its own, different, basis!

Suggested solution:  make the existing integral_basis() function an internal one used by the ring_of_integers() function only, and have K.integra_basis() return the basis of the ring of integers instead.

I applied my patch to 3.2.alpha3 on two machines, a 32-bit Suse linux and a 64-bit ubuntu.
On both machines two files failed doctests:

1.  sage -t  devel/sage-intpts/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
2.  sage -t  devel/sage-intpts/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_rel.py

In totallrel_rel.py we get this:

What about Aranes Maite?
