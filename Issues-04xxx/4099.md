Since #3853, the documentation for the *2d functions in plot/plot.py is outdated.  

It refers to things like point.options and line.reset which are gone and produce errors when you try to access them.

If I had the time I would do a patch for this, but I am currently swamped with other work.

Component: **documentation**
