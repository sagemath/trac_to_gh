One thing I notice with this patch is that sr.py now takes around 650 seconds instead of 450 or so:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
         [655.1 s]
```
I am still merging the patch, but can we get this issue fixed next?

Cheers,

Michael

Yeah, in that doctest we do some wacky coercion into some mv polynomial ring with a couple thousand variables, so this is really an interesting test case. This was first discussed at SD6 in Bristol, so it just shows how much the coercion re-re-write has been an interesting road :)
