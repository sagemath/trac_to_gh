A group of n by n matrices over a field K acts on a polynomial ring with n variables over K. However, this is not implemented yet.

The following should work:

```
sage: M = Matrix(GF(3),[[1,2],[1,1]])
sage: N = Matrix(GF(3),[[2,2],[2,1]])
sage: G = MatrixGroup([M,N])
sage: m = G.0
sage: n = G.1
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]
sage: m*x
x + y
sage: x*m
x - y
sage: (n*m)*x == n*(m*x)
True
sage: x*(n*m) == (x*n)*m
True
```

On the other hand, we still want to have the usual action on vectors or matrices:

```
sage: x = vector([1,1])
sage: x*m
(2, 0)
sage: m*x
(0, 2)
sage: (n*m)*x == n*(m*x)
True
sage: x*(n*m) == (x*n)*m
True
```

```
sage: x = matrix([[1,2],[1,1]])
sage: x*m
[0 1]
[2 0]
sage: m*x
[0 1]
[2 0]
sage: (n*m)*x == n*(m*x)
True
sage: x*(n*m) == (x*n)*m
True
```

Sorry, in the above code I forgot to copy/paste the line

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(3)[]

Moreover, for the reasons above, the ticket should belong to *commutative* algebra, not just algebra (I was clicking on the wrong button).

Opinions?

At least, the following now works:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=GF(3)[]
sage: M=Matrix(GF(3),[[1,2],[1,1]])
sage: G=MatrixGroup([M])
sage: g=G.0
sage: p=x*y^2
sage: g(p)
x^3 + x^2*y - x*y^2 - y^3
```

Some changes:

Nicolas Thiéry suggested to implement the action of matrix groups by a method for polynomials (I call the method `left_matrix_action`), and, for convenience, also provide a `__call__` method for MatrixGroupElement that refers to `left_matrix_action`.

This has several advantages:
* The `__call__` works for any class that has a `left_matrix_action` method, hence, it is not a-priori restricted to polynomials.
* I've put `left_matrix_action` into `multi_polynomial.pyx`, hence, I can use Cython.

I have two Cython concerns left:
1. The innerst loop is 

 ```
 prod([Im[k]**X[k] for k in xrange(n)])
 ```
 where `k` is c'defined as `int`. Should this better be done in a for-loop, rather then creating a list and calling `prod`?
2. The variable `X` is of type `polydict.ETuple`, so I can not directly c'define `X`. One could do

 ```
    cdef tuple X
    for i from 0<i<l:
        X = tuple(Expo[i])
 ```
 But would this be faster?

One observation: 
Reverse the outer loop

```
        for i from l>i>=0:
            X = tuple(Expo[i])
            c = Coef[i]
            for k from 0<=k<n:
                if X[k]:
                    c *= Im[k]**X[k]
            q += c
```
It results in a further improvement of computation time. Is this coincidence? Or is it since summation of polynomials should better start with the smallest summands?

Anyway, I didn't change the patch yet.

Is this coincidence? Or is it since summation of polynomials should better start with the smallest summands?\n\nI made a couple of tests, and there was a small but consistent improvement. So, in the third patch (to be applied after the other two) I did it in that way.\n\nThe `left_matrix_action` shall eventually be used for computing the Reynolds operator of a group action; moreover, the Reynolds operator should be applicable on a *list* of polynomials. Then, the function would repeatedly compute the image of the ring variables under the action of some group element.

I made a couple of tests, and there was a small but consistent improvement. So, in the third patch (to be applied after the other two) I did it in that way.

The `left_matrix_action` shall eventually be used for computing the Reynolds operator of a group action; moreover, the Reynolds operator should be applicable on a *list* of polynomials. Then, the function would repeatedly compute the image of the ring variables under the action of some group element. But then it would be better to compute that image only *once* and pass it to `left_matrix_action`. The new patch provides this functionality. Example (continuing the original example):

```
sage: L=[X.left_matrix_action(g) for X in R.gens()]
sage: p.left_matrix_action(L)
x^3 + x^2*y - x*y^2 - y^3
```

I did confirm that the patches apply cleanly,
that

```
sage: M = Matrix(GF(3),[[1,2],[1,1]])
sage: G = MatrixGroup([M])
sage: g = G.0
sage: g

[1 2]
[1 1]
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(GF(3),2)
sage: p = x*y^2
sage: g(p)
x^3 + x^2*y - x*y^2 - y^3
sage: (x+2*y)*(x+y)^2
x^3 + x^2*y - x*y^2 - y^3

```
works, and that the code seems well-documented.

However, I can't do testing on this machine 
(intrepid ubuntu) and some of the code is written in 
Cython, which I can't really 100% vouch for. 
Seems okay though and simple enough. Since speed was a
topic of the comments above, my only question is that the 
segment

```
 	396	        for i from 0<=i<l: 
 	397	            X = Expo[i] 
 	398	            c = Coef[i] 
 	399	            q += c*prod([Im[k]**X[k] for k in xrange(n)]) 
```
could probably be rewritten as a one-line sum, which might 
(or might not) be faster.

Maybe Martin Albrecht could comment on the Cython code?

If Martin (for example) passes the Cython code, and the
docstrings pass sage -testall, I would give it a positive review.

Really Oops. Sorry.

I implemented it analogous to what is done in Singular. Perhaps I am mistaken in the sense that it is supposed to be a right action (which then would deserve another notation).

```

However, I think it doesn't matter what Singular does. I will look up the literature whether one really wants a *right* or *left* action, and how the left action is supposed to be.

I mean, something like "one has a left action on a variety, which gives rise to a right action on the coordinate ring". I have to sort it out.

If this is the case, then it should be better implemented in the `__mul__` method of polynomials, isn't it? Such as

```

Substitution is a right action. Substitution of the *inverse* is a left action.

hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9205/trac_9205-discrete_log.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9205/trac_9205-doctest.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9438/trac_9438_IntegerMod_log_vs_PARI.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket9423/trac_9423_gap_for_numberfields.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8909/8909_gap2cyclotomic.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket8909/trac_8909_catch_exception.patch.gz')
hg_sage.import_patch('https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket5618/trac_5618_gap_for_cyclotomic_fields.patch.gz')
```
before creating my pacth. But this shouldn't matter, I guess the patch applies cleanly to `sage-4.4`.

Sorry to be a nag, but matrix_group_element.py doesn't pass the doctests:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
matrix_group_element.py
SCORE matrix_group_element.py: 87% (14 of 16)

Missing documentation:
	 * is_MatrixGroupElement(x):
	 * __invert__(self):

----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

This is the same doctest score that the old unpatched file gets too.

Of course there is no change. I added code to one already existing method, extending its functionality, and added tests for the new functionality. But this patch is not about inversion of matrix group elements, and I think the patch is not supposed to add documentation to methods that are not in its scope.

So, unless a doc test *fails* because of my patch, the criticism about not raising the doc test coverage is invalid.

If you would read the patch, you would find:

1. The patch adds one case to an existing method, namely `_act_on_`.

2. The patch adds several doc tests to `_act_on_`, covering the new functionality.

3. The original version of `_act_on_` already had a doc test.

In particular, it is *impossible* to detect the doc test change without reading the patch, by just using `sage -coverage`: The coverage script detects whether `_act_on_` has any test (this is the case with or without my patch), but it does not detect whether the patch extends existing documentation to cover a new case.

I've had a look at the patch, and I don't think you've addressed William's comment #14 from two years back. The following makes me *extremely* uneasy:

```
sage: G = GL(3, 7)
sage: R.<a, b> = GF(7)[]
sage: G.0 * a
[3*a   0   0]
[  0   a   0]
[  0   0   a]
sage: R.<a,b,c> = GF(7)[]
sage: G.0 * a
3*a
```
It looks like there's some pre-existing coercion mechanism which returns elements of the matrix space over R, and you're overriding it in one case with an alternative coercion that returns completely different answers; this violates a Sage coercion axiom (where there are multiple paths in the coercion diagram, all must give the same answer up to numerical precision issues). Moreover, if you look at the patchbot logs it seems to have found an example where the preexisting coercion gets picked up instead of the new one.

Sorry, that's a thumbs down from me. 

David
