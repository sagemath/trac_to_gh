This could be greatly sped up by changing
  maxima.assume('...')
to
 maxima.eval("assume(..)")
in the calculus code...

sage: timeit("maxima.eval('assume(x>0)')")
5 loops, best of 3: 53.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit("maxima.assume(x>0)")
5 loops, best of 3: 122 ms per loop

I don't have time to do this...

To release manager: This should probably be marked Invalid or Wontfix.

The Pynac switch has massively sped up assumptions, so that the timing above that was 2.91 s is now about 0.02 s, presumably on a fairly similar machine.  In addition, the fix indicated by was is no longer correct (if it ever was), because although maxima.eval is indeed faster, it needs to have a string passed in, not a string evaluated at a SymbolicExpression...

Anyway, the proof is in the pudding: with 4.1.1, both with and without the appropriate version of the proposed change, assume(x>0) requires 33 microseconds.  Since that is already 1000 times faster than the fastest time above, we probably don't need to worry about this any more.

It indeed works now:

```
sage: timeit("maxima.eval('assume(x>0)')")

5 loops, best of 3: 1.29 ms per loop
sage: 
sage: timeit("assume(x>0)")
5 loops, best of 3: 40.2 Âµs per loop
```

More to the point, the maxima.eval didn't do what you think it did, because of the preparser (Maxima doesn't understand assume(x>Integer(0))), and fixing things so it did actually assume x>0 and then yielded

```
sage: bool(x>0)
True
```
ended up making things the same speed as the regular assume. That was what I intended to convey above.
