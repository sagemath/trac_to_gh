This could be greatly sped up by changing
  maxima.assume('...')
to
 maxima.eval("assume(..)")
in the calculus code...

sage: timeit("maxima.eval('assume(x>0)')")
5 loops, best of 3: 53.2 ms per loop
sage: timeit("maxima.assume(x>0)")
5 loops, best of 3: 122 ms per loop

I don't have time to do this...

<a id='comment:2'></a>To release manager: This should probably be marked Invalid or Wontfix.

The Pynac switch has massively sped up assumptions, so that the timing above that was 2.91 s is now about 0.02 s, presumably on a fairly similar machine.  In addition, the fix indicated by was is no longer correct (if it ever was), because although maxima.eval is indeed faster, it needs to have a string passed in, not a string evaluated at a SymbolicExpression...

Anyway, the proof is in the pudding: with 4.1.1, both with and without the appropriate version of the proposed change, assume(x>0) requires 33 microseconds.  Since that is already 1000 times faster than the fastest time above, we probably don't need to worry about this any more.

ended up making things the same speed as the regular assume. That was what I intended to convey above.
