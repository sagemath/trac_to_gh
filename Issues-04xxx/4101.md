Hi Robert,

I fixed some issues in the spkg, which is now at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc2/cython-0.9.8.1.1.p0.spkg

Note that the patch level usually starts at p0 and that the name of the spkg and the directory name were not in sync.

I am testing the spkg with the patch to the Sage library applied right now, so expect a review in about 45 minutes.

Cheers,

Michael

Spkg and a following `-ba` passes doctests. Positive review. Let's hope this spkg does not bite us in the ass so late in the release cycle :)

Thanks. I realized later that I had changed the name of the spkg rather than the folder name, but I was at work by then. 

This is intentionally a p0 rather than the next release, so I'm pretty sure it won't bite us. (Famous last words...)

Cool. It would be nice if you could base future cython.spkg off this on in 3.1.2.rc2. I did some fixed to spkg-install and SPKG.txt. It would also be great if you could add to the changes in SPKG.txt once you update it.

Well, the name was p1, so that was mostly my point. I fully understand that you added only one patch on top of the latest Cython release.

> (Famous last words...)

Yeah, what could go wrong :)

I am valgrinding the startup of 3.1.2.rc2 to see if anything fishy was introduced.

Cheers,

Michael
