We should doctest every possible file and not put up with any nodoctest.py crap. This keeps certain files from getting doctested, i.e.

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/server/stats.py
         [2.3 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/server/tests/test_server.py
         [2.6 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/twisted/tests/test_pubkeyauth.py
         [2.4 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/twisted/tests/test_remote.py
         [2.5 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/twisted/pubkeyauth.py
         [2.6 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/dsage/twisted/pb.py
         [2.7 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/sage_email.py
         [2.5 s]
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/quadratic_forms/genera/genus.py
         [2.7 s]
```
The following files are removed by this patch:

```
sage/dsage/database/tests/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/database/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/errors/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/misc/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/scripts/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/server/tests/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/server/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/twisted/tests/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/twisted/nodoctest.py
sage/dsage/nodoctest.py
sage/quadratic_forms/genera/nodoctest.py
sage/server/notebook/compress/nodoctest.py
```
With my current merge tree -t -long passes.

Cheers,

Michael
