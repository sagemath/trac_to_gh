```
This works:

```
sage: text("sage", (0,0), rgbcolor=(0r,0r,0r)).save(SAGE_TMP + 'a.pdf')
```
but this doesn't (big confusing traceback):

```
sage: text("sage", (0,0), rgbcolor=(0,0,0)).save(SAGE_TMP + 'a.pdf')
```

The fix will be to make sure text (or whatever) normalizes the rgb input
params to all be of type float.

Apply only trac_4247.patch -- it is rebased against the latest plot.py.  Otherwise, it looks good to me.
