I modified the attached patch to remove the dependency on #4551. (Only apply `trac_4552-notebook_account_email.patch`)

To elaborate on the problem a little bit: the problem was that the value of the 'email' input box was never read from the form. As a result, when the verification code tries to access it, the server gets a KeyError.

For what it's worth, I give a positive review to adding 'email' to 'input_boxes', which is how Timothy's patch fixes the problem.
