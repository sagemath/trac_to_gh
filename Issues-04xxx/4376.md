salmanhb@gmail.com would like to be able to do linear algebra over `GF(p)[This is the Trac macro *X* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#X-macro)` using pari, but currently conversion of power series in `R[This is the Trac macro *X* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#X-macro)` to pari is only implemented when R=QQ or R=ZZ (via strings).

We should improve the _pari_() function for power series rings to allow R to be any ring in which pari conversion is already defined.

Depends on #7644

Currently pari conversion doesn't even work for series with integer coefficients.  This was pointed out in the docstring for `sage.modular.overconvergent.genus0.OverconvergentModularFormElement._pari_`.

The attached patch extends the range of possible base rings significantly, but is still limited by what `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial._pari_` can do; see its extensive docstring.

Applies and builds without any problems on top of 4.6.1.alpha2 on the machine that I tried it on. All tests pass, the code looks good, and the patch seems to do what it says.

I would have made it "positive review", but then there is the new "Buildbot" link at the top of this page, which says "TestsFailed ..."

What should I do with that?

> ...


What's happened is that #7644 means that many more series can be converted to Pari and reversion performed using `sereverse`.  But when the degree-one coefficient is not a unit, converting the result back to Sage has exposed the following problem:

```
sage: P.<x> = Q[]
sage: Q = P.fraction_field()
sage: Q(1/x)
1/x
sage: Q(pari(1/x))
0
```
This is caused by 

```
sage: P(pari(1/x))
0
```
whereas `P(1/x)` raises `TypeError: denominator must be a unit`.

The other group of failures is caused when conversion to a Pari series is successful but reversion raises a Pari error.

I will shortly post a patch which sorts these difficulties out. I've added a doctest for `reversion` in order to provide another example where Pari fails and the Lagrange inversion code needs to be used.

On lines 316 and 317 of sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py, you write

```
except (NotImplementedError, ValueError): 
    raise TypeError, "denominator must be a unit" 
```
I don't think a `NotImplementedError` should lead to a `TypeError`: that would give a lot of confusion.

Otherwise, this all looks very good.
