If you do

```
   graphics_array([[plot(sin)]]).show(axes=False)
```
the axes still get shown!  This horrendously sucks, e.g. ,for my talk today, and this was not a problem in Sage a few months ago. 

Fortunately, it's a trivial 1-line fix, which I've attached.

I checked the source and the patch still applies, but it seems that the doctest posted does not test that particular code path, so I would suggest that the patch should be applied anyway.

Ok, after testing it with the command line version it becomes clear that the bug remains unfixed and that William's fix is the correct one. In the end I learned something about the plotting code :)
