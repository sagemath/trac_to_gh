This gets rid of a lot of cruft and hundreds of lines of unneeded code now that we have cpdef functions (as well as hundreds of lines of ever .c function that cimports Element). 

All tests pass with sage -testall.

They should be fairly orthogonal--I tried to keep them that way.

The Dickman's function patch you just merged will need the _impl_c methods renamed though.

Good, let's hope for the best.

Can you throw a patch on top for that function then? Should doctests and build pass I will merge this patch and the Diekman fix now.
