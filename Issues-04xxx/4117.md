We leak medium to massive amount of memory in a lot of number field related code. This is caused by

```
     def type(gen self):
        return str(type_name(typ(self.g)))
```
in gen.pyx. The regular and obvious fix causes segfualts in other places (i.e. due to integer.pyx), so I am attaching a workaround fix that has some performance penalty.

Cheers,

Michael
