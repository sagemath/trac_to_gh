http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/jeditable-1.6.1.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/tinyMCE-3.2.0.2.spkg

Create a worksheet and make a text cell by editing it in the "Edit" mode and putting text between the cells.  Switch back to the worksheet view and doubleclick on that text.  A TinyMCE editor should pop up, letting you edit the text.  Save your changes and the worksheet is updated.

Jason,

please bring up the inclusion of these spkgs on [sage-devel]. I did take a look and they seem to be very cross platform and support all major browsers, so I do not see a problem there. One thing discussed should be if this editor is the "best out there" since we will likely end up supporting it for the foreseeable future. From what I have seen at the website it is actively maintained so I am in favor of merging it.

Because of the way that the spkgs at #4267 are set up, to test this patch, you need to apply the patch at #4267 on top of it.  This is because the spkgs at #4267 are installed in a new directory and the necessary setup for this new directory is contained in the patch there.  The patch there contains the patch here.

So, to test this:

1. Apply the patch here.
2. Apply the patch at #4267
3. Install all of the spkgs listed at #4267.
4. Optionally, apply the extcode patch at #4267, which deletes the packages from the extcode directory.

Then follow the instructions above to create a text cell and edit it (i.e., create it by editing the worksheet, then double-click on the text to bring up TinyMCE).
