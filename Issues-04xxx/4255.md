This provides in-place editing of text cells using tinyMCE and jEditable (spkgs provided below).  Basically, you create a text cell by inserting something between the cells (between the ending }}} and the starting {{{ of the next cell) in the "Edit" view.  Switching back to the worksheet view, you can then doubleclick on the html text and an in-place TinyMCE editor pops up letting you edit the html text.

Jason,

please bring up the inclusion of these spkgs on [sage-devel]. I did take a look and they seem to be very cross platform and support all major browsers, so I do not see a problem there. One thing discussed should be if this editor is the "best out there" since we will likely end up supporting it for the foreseeable future. From what I have seen at the website it is actively maintained so I am in favor of merging it.

Because of the way that the spkgs at #4267 are set up, to test this patch, you need to apply the patch at #4267 on top of it.  This is because the spkgs at #4267 are installed in a new directory and the necessary setup for this new directory is contained in the patch there.  The patch there contains the patch here.

So, to test this:

1. Apply the patch here.
2. Apply the patch at #4267
3. Install all of the spkgs listed at #4267.
4. Optionally, apply the extcode patch at #4267, which deletes the packages from the extcode directory.

Then follow the instructions above to create a text cell and edit it (i.e., create it by editing the worksheet, then double-click on the text to bring up TinyMCE).

Okay, *ignore* all patches here.  Instead, apply the edit-in-place-and-javascript-spkgs.patch patch at #4267 and install the spkgs there.

That patch enables easy creation of text cells--just shift-click on the "new cell" bar in the notebook.
