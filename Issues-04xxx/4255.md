This provides in-place editing of text cells using tinyMCE and jEditable (spkgs provided below).  Basically, you create a text cell by inserting something between the cells (between the ending }}} and the starting {{{ of the next cell) in the "Edit" view.  Switching back to the worksheet view, you can then doubleclick on the html text and an in-place TinyMCE editor pops up letting you edit the html text.

please bring up the inclusion of these spkgs on [sage-devel]. I did take a look and they seem to be very cross platform and support all major browsers, so I do not see a problem there. One thing discussed should be if this editor is the "best out there" since we will likely end up supporting it for the foreseeable future.

Because of the way that the spkgs at #4267 are set up, to test this patch, you need to apply the patch at #4267 on top of it.  This is because the spkgs at #4267 are installed in a new directory and the necessary setup for this new directory is contained in the patch there.  The patch there contains the patch here.

So, to test this:

1. Apply the patch here.
2. Apply the patch at #4267
3. Install all of the spkgs listed at #4267.
4. Optionally, apply the extcode patch at #4267, which deletes the packages from the extcode directory.

Then follow the instructions above to create a text cell and edit it (i.e., create it by editing the worksheet, then double-click on the text to bring up TinyMCE).
