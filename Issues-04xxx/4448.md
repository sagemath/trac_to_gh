Try this interact in the notebook:

```
@interact
def f(n=matrix([[pi^2]])):
    print n
```

Notice that the matrix input appears empty.  What is happening, I think, is that
str(...) is being called on each entry instead of repr(...) which causes uses of ASCII art.   It seems this is a problem only for matrices.
