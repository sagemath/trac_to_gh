```
just for the record: installing tcsh makes the problem go away.  This hint was 
buried in a longer mail on this list, so I repeat it here... 
```
He also reported an interface problem which could also be split off to another ticket:

```
Another hint:  qepcad does not like fractions, not even of integers, and the 
sage interface doesn't deal with this.  So you have to reduce them yourself, 
i.e., instead of 
a < b/2 
write 
2*a < b 
Otherwise qepcad will appear to do nothing. 
```

Cheers,

Michael
