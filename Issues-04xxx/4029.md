Sourcing sage-env from any directory other than SAGE_ROOT or SAGE_LOCAL/bin kills the shell.  This is considerably disconcerting behaviour.  An explanatory message would be nice (if not a proper fix).

Once #9960 is merged, this can be closed. Don't merge any of the patches here!

There is a typo in the commit message, but otherwise this is the correct fix. I initially also wanted to do the indenting, but this is a much cleaner and better solution.

Reopened because wjp pointed out a serious issue -- the rest of the script gets executed. 

Some irc discussion about this:

```
williamstein: Regarding sage-env, I redid a patch of yours at #4029.
[06:15am] williamstein:
Wow, what does "$(exit 1)" mean?
[06:15am] williamstein:
ah, you give a reference.
[06:16am] williamstein:
I still don't understand it.
[06:18am] williamstein:
Mike could you change the patch itself to include a comment about what $(exit 1) means?  Or maybe just a link to that page in
[06:18am] williamstein:
a
[06:18am] williamstein:
comment?
[06:18am] williamstein:
Because googling for "$(exit 1)" would be tricky.
[06:18am] williamstein:
$(exit 1)
[06:18am] williamstein:
actually, it is easy to google for.
[06:18am] williamstein:
No, it isn't.
[06:20am] williamstein:
well if it works, it works, I guess.
[06:21am] mhansen:
Yeah, I don't quite understand it myself.
[06:22am] williamstein:
Well, it works perfecty.
[06:22am] williamstein:
so positive review.
[06:23am] williamstein:
And the current behavior in Sage (without the patch) is indeed "disconcerting".
[06:24am] mhansen:
I'm surprised that one page was the only page that I could find something about it.
[06:24am] williamstein:
Indeed.
[06:25am] williamstein:
It's hard to google though.
[06:27am] wjp:
isn't this trick only for passing a return status? I don't think it actually stops the script that's being sourced, right?
[06:28am] williamstein:
I don't know.  But if you try it, for some reason it works.
[06:28am] wjp:
hm, strange. Did you also test the remainder of sage-env doesn't get executed?
[06:28am] williamstein:
wjp -- you seam like the type to pull open the bash source code, read it, and completely understand what $(exit 1) does :-)
[06:29am] wjp:
I thought $(...) was the same as `...`
[06:29am] wjp:
(yes, I am kind of that type :-) )
[06:29am] williamstein:
crap, in fact, the remainder does get executed.
[06:30am] williamstein:
hey mhansen -- what did my original patch do?
[06:30am] williamstein:
since I think you deleted it.
[06:30am] mhansen:
Ripped the bottom half of sage-env out and put it in a different file.
[06:30am] mhansen:
By bottom half, I meant the part below that line.
[06:31am] williamstein:
oh, now I remember doing that.
[06:31am] williamstein:
"When in doubt, refactor it out!"
```

This means that any script which sources sage-env will have to check return status and exit rather than relying on `sage-env` to exit for it.

If we want/need to keep the current behavior of exiting, we could use a hack like

```

case $- in

        die=return;;
    *)      # non-interactive shell

esac

$die 1
```
to not exit the shell unless it's interactive.  Unfortunately I'm not sure how portable it is--I checked bash and zsh.

What my previous hack does is try to return and if that fails (because it was executed instead of sourced) then it calls exit.  If it's only ever sourced (per #10469) then it would be better to change them all to return, since that's what my hack would do.
