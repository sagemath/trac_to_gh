In `setup.py`, there are several source files which appear in the `sources` list more than once. For instance, the entry for `sage.rings.rational` looks like:

```
Extension('sage.rings.rational',
           sources = ['sage/rings/rational.pyx',
                      'sage/ext/arith.pyx', \
                      'sage/rings/integer.pyx'],
           libraries=['ntl', 'gmp'])
```

The other two `.pyx` files that appear there were added in the old days, when Pyrex needed us to do this in order to compile `rational.pyx` correctly. Note that because of this, several files in the Sage library get compiled multiple times. (For instance, try changing `sage/ext/arith.pyx` and doing a `sage -br`.) We should fix this.

I've already made the changes to `setup.py`, but I really need to do a `sage -ba` to feel like I've appropriately tested this. I'll do that tomorrow. I'm going to make this ticket dependent on #4443, since I already fixed the situation for `sage/ext/arith.pyx` while working on that ticket.
