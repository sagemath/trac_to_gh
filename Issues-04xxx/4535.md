The main goals of this ticket are to split up plot.py so that it's not 4500 lines long and change the way the bounding boxes are computed.

If we are moving to be more based on matplotlib, it would be nice if we could draw stuff in matplotlib and easily convert the result to a sage Graphics object, so we could then add it to other sage graphics objects, etc.

In other words, it would be great if this worked:

sage: a=pylab.plot([1,2,3], [1,2,3], 'go-', label='line 1', linewidth=2)
sage: Graphics(a)

I really like this patch reading it.  But it doesn't apply:

```
patching file sage/calculus/desolvers.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 39 with fuzz 2 (offset 2 lines).
patching file sage/geometry/polyhedra.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 30
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/geometry/polyhedra.py.rej

Hunk #2 FAILED at 120
Hunk #6 succeeded at 253 with fuzz 2 (offset 14 lines).

Hunk #17 FAILED at 1261
Hunk #18 FAILED at 2349
2 out of 24 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/plot/plot.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```

Assuming it works, it gets copyright headers, and passes all doctests (in the whole tree), I will give this a positive review.

The rebased patch applies cleanly to my Sage 3.2.1.alpha3 merge tree. I am doing a sage -ba right now (with a nuke build directory) followed by doctesting to make 100% sure all import issues have been truly fixed.
