The main goals of this ticket are to split up plot.py so that it's not 4500 lines long and change the way the bounding boxes are computed.

If we are moving to be more based on matplotlib, it would be nice if we could draw stuff in matplotlib and easily convert the result to a sage Graphics object, so we could then add it to other sage graphics objects, etc.

In other words, it would be great if this worked:

sage: a=pylab.plot([1,2,3], [1,2,3], 'go-', label='line 1', linewidth=2)
sage: Graphics(a)

I really like this patch reading it.  But it doesn't apply:

```

Assuming it works, it gets copyright headers, and passes all doctests (in the whole tree), I will give this a positive review.

The rebased patch applies cleanly to my Sage 3.2.1.alpha3 merge tree. I am doing a sage -ba right now (with a nuke build directory) followed by doctesting to make 100% sure all import issues have been truly fixed.
