All of the following work fine in 3.2.alpha0:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: x,(x,-1,1))
sage: plot(lambda x: x,-1,1)
sage: plot(x,x,-1,1)
sage: plot(x,-1,1)
```
But this doesn't:

```
sage: plot(lambda x: x,x,-1,1)
verbose 0 (3400: plot.py, plot) there were 3 extra arguments (besides <function <lambda> at 0x11a22f70>)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnboundLocalError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

-> 3603     return G
   3604 
   3605 def _plot(funcs, xrange, parametric=False,

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'G' referenced before assignment
```
Upon further examination, it seems that the culprit is that SymbolicVariable has a plot method, but lambda functions do not.  This is easy to fix, by changing plot() in plot.py to handle this, for the n==3 args case.

This seems to install but with an odd message (see below). It also 
passed sage -testall on a intel mac os10.4 running sage 3.2.1.

Patch and docstrings look good too. Modulo the odd message below, I give this
a positive review.

Hi David,

This:

```
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1474 with fuzz 1 (offset -2100 lines)
```
is harmless in this case since you applied the patch against a version of Sage that doe not have the plotting refactoring patch applied. I would highly recommend you update to 3.2.1 or 3.2.2.alpha0 once it is out since some rather invasive patches related to coercion will be merged in 3.2.2.a0.

In general a fuzz of thousands of lines always indicates something bad going on unless you get hit by missing refactoring patches like in this case.

Cheers,

Michael
