I just downloaded sage 3.2.2 and found it to choke on utf-8 encoded source files (for comparison, sage 3.0 handles them properly). My bet is that some problem happened during integration of issue 2637. Tested using sage-3.2.2-ubuntu32bit-intel-i686-Linux binary distribution.

Take the file like:

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
Zażółć gęślą jaźń
"""

print 1
```

and try:

```
$ sage test.sage
```

Result:

```
  File "test.py", line 6
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc5' in file test.py on line 7, but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details
```

Produced file:

```
# This file was *autogenerated* from the file test.sage.
from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library
_sage_const_1 = Integer(Integer(1))# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
Zażółć gęślą jaźń
"""

print _sage_const_1
```

Nice fix. Positive review.

We might want to think about writing some tests for the various sage scripts, but this is not subject to this ticket.

I can confirm that applying this patch on 3.2.2 resolves the problem I initially reported
(cd ..../sage-3.2.2-ubuntu32bit-intel-i686-Linux/local/bin;
 patch -p1 < .../trac_4975.patch)

Still, something is wrong. The following file is handled properly:

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
Zażółć gęślą jaźń
"""

print 1
print u"Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
```

but if you comment out `print 1`:

```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

"""
Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
"""

print u"Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
```

it fails again:

```
sage test2.sage
  File "test2.py", line 3
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc5' in file test2.py on line 4, but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details
```

What is interesting, removing any of elements (either a """ string, or print) makes the problem to disappear.

Here is .py generated from the file above:

```

"""
Zażółć gęślą jaźń"
"""
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This file was *autogenerated* from the file test2.sage.
from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library

Having taken a look at the source, it seems that the problem happens here:

```
    insert = '%s%s%s.\nfrom sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library\n'%(coding, AUTOGEN_MSG, f)
    i = find_position_right_after_module_docstring(G)

as you see, if sage detects module docstring, it adds coding AFTER IT
