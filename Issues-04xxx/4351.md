Please see #4346 first and apply the patch there.

After applying this patch and doctesting all sage, there are a bunch of failures in the modular abelian varieties code:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_ambient_jacobian.py # 3 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar_newform.py # 3 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/morphism.py # 3 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py # 34 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py # 11 doctests failed
```

These are because of bugs in that code exposed by doing proper bounds checking.


Component: **modular forms**

This is a red herring.  It is fixed by #4350, and there were never any bugs suggested by this ticket.
