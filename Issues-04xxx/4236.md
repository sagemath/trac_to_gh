sage: Im = I._magma_()

This does not seem like a bug in the Sage/Magma interface.  It seems like a misunderstanding of Magma itself, which doesn't have a GroebnerBasis function that takse as input an ideal in a boolean ring.  Magma simply doesn't do that.  It only has Groebner for ideals in *polynomial* rings.  There are some functions on ideals in boolean rings, but not many.  I.e., above

We could make Magma better than Magma by 
* adding the generators of the quotient to the ideal `J = I + Q`
* computing `gb := GroebnerBasis(J)`
* coerce the result to the quotient again. 

This is equivalent to computing the GB in the quotient directly.
