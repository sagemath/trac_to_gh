1) This should work (?)

sage: B.<x,y> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: B*[x*y + 1, x + y]
sage: I = B*[x*y + 1, x + y]
sage: I._magma_()

Ideal of Affine Algebra of rank 2 over GF(2)
Lexicographical Order
Variables: x, y
Quotient relations:
[
x^2 + x,
y^2 + y
]
Generating basis:
[
x*y + 1,
x + y
]

sage: Im = I._magma_()
sage: Im.GroebnerBasis()
TypeError: Error evaluation Magma code.
IN:_sage_[21] := GroebnerBasis(_sage_[20]);
OUT:
>> _sage_[21] := GroebnerBasis(_sage_[20]);
                             ^
Runtime error in 'GroebnerBasis': Bad argument types
Argument types given: RngMPolRes
```

We could make Magma better than Magma by 
* adding the generators of the quotient to the ideal `J = I + Q`
* computing `gb := GroebnerBasis(J)`
* coerce the result to the quotient again. 

This is equivalent to computing the GB in the quotient directly.
