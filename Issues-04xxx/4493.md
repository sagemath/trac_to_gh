It would be handy in differential equations to be able to do differentiation and integration of matrices and vectors, with the exact same answer as obtained by using the apply_map method.

This depends on #4713

I guess the integral of a matrix doesn't come up that often, so I'm changing my request.  Besides, the integral can calculated using the apply_map function at #4713 for vectors or the existing apply_map function for matrices.
