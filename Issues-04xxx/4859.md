I maintain a database of covering designs (k-subsets of a v-set such that all t-sets are
in at least one of the k-sets) at http://www.ccrwest.org/cover.html.  This patch implements
covering designs in Sage using the IncidenceStructure class, and allows a user to get coverings
from the website.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

Two minor comments:

(1) I'm confused by this docstring

```
A $(v,k,t)$ covering design $C$ is an incidence structure ...
```

combined with this behaviour:


```
sage: C = best_known_covering_design_www(7, 3, 2); C
<class 'sage.combinat.designs.covering_design.CoveringDesign'>
sage: D = C.incidence_structure
sage: type(D)
<class 'sage.combinat.designs.incidence_structures.IncidenceStructure'>
```

D is an incidence structure but the way of creating D seems slightly nonstandard.
Why not

```
sage: D = C.incidence_structure()
```
instead? I'm not saying change this, just wondering why it is the way it is.

(2) For future reference, the patch naming is slightly non-standard (trac_4859-covering-designs.patch or something like that is more typical).

REFEREE REPORT:

The overall style of the code looks really good.

* This worries me:

```
        82	    bound = 1.0 
 	83	    for i in range(t-1,-1,-1): 
 	84	        bound = (bound*RDF(v-i)/RDF(k-i)).ceiling() 
 	85	 
 	86	    return bound 
```
I'm worried about overflow.  Maybe using interval arithmetic would be better, i.e., the real interval field.  You could make a comment about why precision isn't an issue, but I sort of wonder. 


*  I think it might be nice to avoid confusion if you make all the attributes private (i.e., put an underscore (or two) in the beginning of their names), then have methods to access them, e.g., 

```
This is bad:
sage:  C=CoveringDesign(7,3,2,7,range(7),[[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 4], [0, 5, 6], [1, 3, 5], [1, 4, 6], [2, 3, 6], [2, 4, 5]],0, 'Projective Plane')
sage: C.method
'Projective Plane'
sage: C.method = 'foo bar'
sage: C.method
'foo bar'

This is better:
sage: C.method()
'Projective Plane'
sage: C.method?
lots of nice documentation about what the C.__method *means* and how to use it. 
```
Do the same with all the other attributes.   This is for consistency with the rest of Sage, and because it is easier for users. 

* You defined a `show` method. This is reserved for graphical display.   Instead call that method `_repr_`, so it gets automatically picked up by the print and str(...) methods.   Also `_repr_` should return a string instead of using the print command. 

* change ` requires internet, optional ` to `optional -- requires internet`.  Doing that isn't documented anywhere, but it's the "new way" now that I wrote an optional doctesting framework that really singles out various components. 


With the above issues addressed, this code should go into sage.
