<a id='comment:3'></a>The restriction to 4 indentation levels is decidedly strange, given that the patch itself has a 6-deep indentation.  This can be written more elegantly:

```
var indenting, id, tab;
indenting = RegExp("\n( *)","g");
while(indenting.test(text[0])) {
  id   = indexing.lastIndex;
  tab  = RegExp.lastMatch.substring(1);
}
if( id == second_last_break && second_last_break != -1) {
    get_cell(id).value = text[0] + tab + text[1]; 
    set_cursor_position(cell, position + tab.length);
}
```

The above code hasn't been tested, but should be a good start.

<a id='comment:5'></a>REVIEW

This is *REALLY* nice and *almost* works.  It has one bug, which is that if you enter a blank line, the auto-indent is off by one.  E.g., I got the following when I entered a blank line after the first print statement:

```
if True:
    print "hi"
    
   print "mom"
```

I should have got either

```
if True:
    print "hi"
    
    print "mom"
```
or 

```
if True:
    print "hi"

print "mom"
```

Which is a design decision.  To be more like the Python/Ipython command line, one would get the latter.  To be more like an IDE, maybe the former.  I don't care which, just that the current behavior (which is neither) is buggy.

That said, if this bit rots forever that would be bad.  I would almost rather have the buggy patch than no patch at all, since even with the bug it's pretty nice functionality.

It would however by nice if there were a way to turn it off.  That will have to wait until Timothy Clemans user management features get in.
