This is stupid:

```
sage: gcd(3,6,2)
3
```

The problem is that there is an undocumented mysterious and not even used integer third input!

```
File:        /Users/was/s/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/rings/arith.py
Type:        <type 'function'>
Definition:  gcd(a, b, integer, **kwargs)
Docstring: 

    The greatest common divisor of a and b, or if a is a list and b is
    omitted the greatest common divisor of all elements of a.

    INPUT:
        a,b -- two elements of a ring with gcd
    or
        a -- a list or tuple of elements of a ring with gcd

    Additional keyword arguments are passed to the respectively called
    methods.

    EXAMPLES:
        sage: GCD(97,100)
        1
        sage: GCD(97*10^15, 19^20*97^2)
        97
        sage: GCD(2/3, 4/3)
        2/3
        sage: GCD([2,4,6,8])
        2
        sage: GCD(srange(0,10000,10))  # fast  !!
        10
```

This caused me a ton of confusion just now.
