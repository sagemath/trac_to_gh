Make it so that the following works:

```
sage: var('t')
t
sage: x=function('x', t)
sage: soln=desolve_laplace(diff(x,t)+x==1, x, ics=[0,2]) 
sage: soln(3) 
e^-3 + 1
```

BTW, ICs used with desolve really does not work: from the docstring, you see

```
           sage: x = var('x')
            sage: y = function('y', x)

            (e^10*y(10) + 8*e^10)*e^(-x)/2 + (y(10) +12)*e^(x - 10)/2 - x
```
so for some reason 2 is not plugged in for y(10).

Next time, just make the ticket reviewed (put it to needs_review asking somebody to confirm to close the ticket).

This way we have a peer-reviewed proposal to close and the release manager will see that the ticket has positive_review.

As Robin Williams says in 'Aladdin', \"Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space.\"\n\n> I also think it is good to review the fact that the bug is indeed invalid.\n\nOf course, one should review that a bug is invalid, but in this case it is the duplicate status that is at issue, which is more of a release issue.

> > Okay, that's different from how we've handled closing of duplicates in the past.   After all, there is nothing to review in this case.

> Well, I myself have gotten complaints about closing tickets (for whatever reason) when not being a release manager. 

Yes, as have I; I think that only having release managers (or possibly experienced non-current release managers like Mike and Minh) actually close the tickets is wise.  

But in this case, you *are* the release manager!   As Robin Williams says in 'Aladdin', "Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space."

> I also think it is good to review the fact that the bug is indeed invalid.

Of course, one should review that a bug is invalid, but in this case it is the duplicate status that is at issue, which is more of a release issue.  Anyway, I don't mind Robert getting more props!
