This would be awesome! 

BTW, ICs used with desolve really does not work: from the docstring, you see

```
           sage: x = var('x')
            sage: y = function('y', x)
            sage: de = diff(y,x,2) - y == x
            sage: desolve(de, y)
            k1*e^x + k2*e^(-x) - x
            sage: f = desolve(de, y, [10,2,1]); f
            (e^10*y(10) + 8*e^10)*e^(-x)/2 + (y(10) +12)*e^(x - 10)/2 - x
```
so for some reason 2 is not plugged in for y(10).

Next time, just make the ticket reviewed (put it to needs_review asking somebody to confirm to close the ticket).

This way we have a peer-reviewed proposal to close and the release manager will see that the ticket has positive_review.

Well, I myself have gotten complaints about closing tickets (for whatever reason) when not being a release manager.  I also think it is good to review the fact that the bug is indeed invalid.

Yes, as have I; I think that only having release managers (or possibly experienced non-current release managers like Mike and Minh) actually close the tickets is wise.  

But in this case, you *are* the release manager!   As Robin Williams says in 'Aladdin', "Phenomenal cosmic powers! Itty bitty living space."

Of course, one should review that a bug is invalid, but in this case it is the duplicate status that is at issue, which is more of a release issue.  Anyway, I don't mind Robert getting more props!
