<div id="comment:0"></div>

In Sage-3.1.4 we have this, which I consider wrong:

```
sage: n = 4
sage: type(sqrt(n))
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicComposition'>
sage: type(n.sqrt())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

I think sqrt(foo) should first check if foo has a sqrt method, and
if so call it.    I realize there is a subtle problem here, because
the integer sqrt function calls the symbolic calculus one!  So we
need some sort of architecture to fix this right.   This isn't trivial.

Component: **basic arithmetic**

This patch takes care of the problem as stated, passes tests for integer.pyx and rational.pyx; test for calculus.py times out (as it always does on my computer, not just for this patch).  

I am *fairly* certain it also does not introduce some new endless loops or other weird bugs, but that would be worth checking out by any reviewer.

I think that the .sqrt() method in Integer and Rational should call sqrt._do_sqrt instead of creating the SymbolicComposition themselves.  For example, see

```
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(4)
2
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicComposition'>
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(5)
sqrt(5)
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(5, all=True)
[sqrt(5), -sqrt(5)]

The new docstring also clarifies that the extend option to _do_sqrt is completely ignored, and why that is the right behavior. 

This seems okay; I didn't have time to merge it but the new tests behave correctly.  So this means that the following is the desired behavior for when to extend and when not to extend?

```
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(Integer(3),extend=False)
sqrt(3)
sage: a=3; type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: a.sqrt(extend=False)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError: square root of 3 not an integer
```
If so, then let's finally let the square root of 4 be 2!
