In Sage-3.1.4 we have this, which I consider wrong:

```
sage: n = 4
sage: type(sqrt(n))
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicComposition'>
sage: type(n.sqrt())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

I think sqrt(foo) should first check if foo has a sqrt method, and
if so call it.    I realize there is a subtle problem here, because
the integer sqrt function calls the symbolic calculus one!  So we
need some sort of architecture to fix this right.   This isn't trivial.

This patch takes care of the problem as stated, passes tests for integer.pyx and rational.pyx; test for calculus.py times out (as it always does on my computer, not just for this patch).  

I am *fairly* certain it also does not introduce some new endless loops or other weird bugs, but that would be worth checking out by any reviewer.

I think that the .sqrt() method in Integer and Rational should call sqrt._do_sqrt instead of creating the SymbolicComposition themselves.  For example, see

```
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(4)
2
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.calculus.calculus.SymbolicComposition'>
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(5)
sqrt(5)
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(5, all=True)
[sqrt(5), -sqrt(5)]
```

I attached a trivial followup patch to sqrt-nonsymbolic-1.patch which adds a docstring for the _do_sqrt function (which had no docstring) and some doctests to that function.  The new docstring also clarifies that the extend option to _do_sqrt is completely ignored, and why that is the right behavior. 

The original patch sqrt-nonsymbolic-1.patch and that patch plus the attached followup sqrt-nonsymblic-2.patch together pass all doctests for me in rings and calculus.

The new docstring also clarifies that the extend option to _do_sqrt is completely ignored, and why that is the right behavior. 

This seems okay; I didn't have time to merge it but the new tests behave correctly.  So this means that the following is the desired behavior for when to extend and when not to extend?

```
sage: sqrt._do_sqrt(Integer(3),extend=False)
sqrt(3)
sage: a=3; type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: a.sqrt(extend=False)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError: square root of 3 not an integer
```
If so, then let's finally let the square root of 4 be 2!
