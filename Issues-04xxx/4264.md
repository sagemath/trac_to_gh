For consistency with b_invariants, etc., and to emphasize immutability, it would be
good for E.a_invariants() to return a tuple.  Changing this could change lots of doctests, etc., so this isn't trivial.

Quick comment:  the cached `self.__ainvs` should actually *be* a tuple.  So the only code to change is in line 142 in `ell_generic.py`, from this

```
        self.__ainvs = ainvs
```
to this

```
        self.__aincs = tuple(ainvs)
```
as well as the doctests.

Could you post your first draft of a patch here ? I will try to work on it.

Sorry, but after a year I am sure that it is lost for ever.  I should have uploaded it anyway with a "needs more work" tag.  Anyway, after a year of version changes it would never have merged without a lot of work.
