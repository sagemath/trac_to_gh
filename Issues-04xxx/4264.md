For consistency with b_invariants, etc., and to emphasize immutability, it would be
good for E.a_invariants() to return a tuple.  Changing this could change lots of doctests, etc., so this isn't trivial.

Sorry, but after a year I am sure that it is lost for ever.  I should have uploaded it anyway with a "needs more work" tag.  Anyway, after a year of version changes it would never have merged without a lot of work.
