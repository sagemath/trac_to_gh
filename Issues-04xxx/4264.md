For consistency with b_invariants, etc., and to emphasize immutability, it would be
good for E.a_invariants() to return a tuple.  Changing this could change lots of doctests, etc., so this isn't trivial.

Quick comment:  the cached `self.__ainvs` should actually *be* a tuple.  So the only code to change is in line 142 in `ell_generic.py`, from this

```
        self.__ainvs = ainvs
