I guess sphinx is having trouble with the nested quotes?

Another problem with the html conversion is that the footer (in ubuntu seamonkey) in that file is
not offset as blue. (Eg, the next link at the bottom of the page does not appear as it is overwritten by the white page background, but it is there if you mose over it.) It does render correctly in epiphany however. Does anyone but me even use seamonkey?
