I mean, *here* are my new timings after the regression fix in pt3.patch:

```
AFTER PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 168 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop


BEFORE PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 134 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 138 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
```

I copied the wrong thing before.

Here's the actual generated code for `x,y = t`

```
    if (PyTuple_CheckExact(__pyx_v_t) && PyTuple_GET_SIZE(__pyx_v_t) == 2) {
    PyObject* tuple = __pyx_v_t;
    __pyx_2 = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(tuple, 0);
    Py_INCREF(__pyx_2);
    Py_DECREF(__pyx_v_x);
    __pyx_v_x = __pyx_2;
    __pyx_2 = 0;
    __pyx_2 = PyTuple_GET_ITEM(tuple, 1);
    Py_INCREF(__pyx_2);
    Py_DECREF(__pyx_v_y);
    __pyx_v_y = __pyx_2;
    __pyx_2 = 0;
  }
  else {
     [generic code]
  }
```

If `t` is declared to be a tuple, half of the first check shouldn't be needed (I don't think this optimization is in place yet). So it should be as fast as type check + length check + PyTuple_GET_ITEM. In any case, it's faster than indexing not using PyTyple_GET_ITEM.

Yes, that should be a ticket on the Cython trac.
