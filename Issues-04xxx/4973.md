`__getitem__` in matrix0.pyx uses C Python API and that code should have **never** been merged as is. The C API was used to get maximum speed. If possible rewrite this code to not use the C API, but it should not lose too much speed. This might be impossible or require adding bits to Cython.

So I've reviewed Jason's patch, and everything looks good -- except that for lots of cases, in particular the primary `M[i,j]` use case, things are noticeably slower (on the order of 25%). This is no good on such a basic operation.

This code actually does **more** than the previous version (i.e. accepts additional types, negative indices, etc), and is still the same speed. 

Cython doesn't quite do everything we want to get maximal speed out of this call. I'm going to submit another patch that uses it more judiciously, but gets yet more speed, because this is such an important piece of code.

Doctests pass. I've tried lots of the doc examples and they are faster or the same as the old code, except for the following case.  These commands are each executed in a fresh Sage session.

```

AFTER PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 168 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop


BEFORE PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 134 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 138 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
```

So, positive review if this regression is fixed.

Okay, pt3 fixes the regression.  Here are my new timings:

```
AFTER PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 168 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 166 µs per loop


BEFORE PATCH:

sage: m=[(1, -2, -1, -1,9), (1, 8, 6, 2,2), (1, 1, -1, 1,4), (-1, 2, -2, -1,4)];M= matrix(m)
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 134 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 138 µs per loop
sage: timeit('M[[1,2],[0,1,2]]')
625 loops, best of 3: 143 µs per loop
```

So we're faster than the original code again.

Great job. Positive review, with the doctest fix that I'm going to post in a second.  I presume that mabshoff will run all doctests on it to make sure that there are no errors in other code because of the additional capabilities.
