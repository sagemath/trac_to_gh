This is because the eigenvectors_left and eigenvectors_right for CDF and RDF matrices returns the data in a way that is totally incompatible with what the parent is expecting.

I can make a patch for this once I have a 3.2.2alpha1 build.  Otherwise, if Jason would like to do this, I wouldn't object :-)

Patch causes `left_eigenvectors()` and `right_eigenvectors()` for CDF and RDF to return eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the same format as for exact matrices.  Then eigenmatrices for these matrices behave as they should.  No attempt is made to identify eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than one.

Patch is failing doctests in the modular form code right now, so will need some more work.

This patch fixes the bug and generally brings double-precision eigenvectors up-to-date.

`left_eigenvectors` and `right_eigenvectors` now return their results in the same format as for exact matrices, so routines like `eigenmatrix_right` can digest the results properly.

Consequently, `eigenspaces_left` was adjusted for this new format.  There was no `eigenspaces_right`, now there is.

The changed code in `modular/modform/numerical.py` simply adjusts for the new format to allow doctests to pass and is probably sub-optimal.  There is a bug nearby, so this will be addressed on #8018.

Doctests:  I had some strange behavior for zero eigenvalues (ie very, very small eigenvalues), so the doctests avoid these.  For these eigenvalues, the tests would fail on a first run, but would pass on all subsequent runs (or vice-versa).  This was observed on my own machine and  boxen.math.washington.edu.  So I've avoided these eigenvalues by selecting certain ones in the doctests.

Documentation:  documentation was tested for these four functions via notebook introspection.  The rest of the file needs attention before it can go into the documentation, see #8046.

Great job!

I think these changes would make the code easier to read:

```
 	662	        for k in range(len(spectrum)): 
 	663	            evalue = spectrum[k][0] 
 	664	            evector = spectrum[k][1][0] 
 	665	            pairs.append((evalue, evector.parent().span_of_basis([evector],check=False))) 

changed to

for eval,evectors in spectrum:
    evec = evectors[0]
    evector = evec.parent().span_of_basis([evec],check=False)
    pairs.append((evalue, evector))

```

(similarly on lines 722-725)

Also:

```
B = matrix(CDF, [spectrum[i][1][0] for i in range(len(spectrum))]).transpose() 

changed to

B = matrix(CDF, [evecs[0] for _,evecs in spectrum]).transpose() 

```

Jason,

Thanks for helping me be more Pythonic.

The bit in the modular form module is going to be replaced in #8018 by totally different code, so I didn't change that.  First suggestion (in spirit) has been incorporated in updated patch.

Rob

Has this been checked on Solaris? 

There's general information about building on Solaris at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris

Information specifically for 't2' at

 http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2

Both the source (4.3.0.1 is the latest to build on Solaris) and a binary which will run on any SPARC can be found at http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

Hi Dave,

Not that I know of.  I develop with KUbuntu.

Maybe a reviewer with Solaris experience can put it through its paces.  Totally Python, so I'd guess numerical issues might be the only distinction.

Thanks,
Rob
