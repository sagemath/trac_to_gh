```
Two different ways to do partial fractions should have the same function name:

```
sage: x=polygen(QQ)
sage: f=(x - 3)/((x +1)*(x-1))
sage: f.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0, [-1/(x - 1), 2/(x + 1)])
sage: x=var('x')
sage: f=(x - 3)/((x +1)*(x-1))
sage: f.partial_fraction()
2/(x + 1) - 1/(x - 1)
```

An added bonus would be if they gave similar output (currently one gives a list, the other gives an expression).
