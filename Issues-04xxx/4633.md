In order to run the the comparison of integration results between FriCAS and Maxima, it is also necessary to make some simple additions to the 'axiom.py' interface:

Integration produce some additional "Fortran-style" names and a
coercion that have to be translated before the input form can be
processed by Sage.

With this change we can do:

```
  test_int = integrand.integrate(x)
  fricas_int = axiom.integrate(integrand,x).sage()
  fricas_cmp = (test_int.simplify_full()-fricas_int.simplify_full()).simplify_full()
  if (fricas_cmp == 0):
      print "FriCAS agrees with Maxima."

```

This is what I do:

0. Pretest, e.g. try: axiom(1/log(x)).sage()

```
    NotImplementedError
```
1. Click on the link to that patch: "trac_4633.patch"
2. Click on the link to "original format"
3. Save the patch file somewhere, e.g. ~/trac_4633.patch
4. cd sage*/devel/sage-main
5. apply the patch: patch -p1 < ~/trac_4633.patch
6. re-build sage: sage -br
7. test, e.g. try: axiom(1/log(x)).sage()

```
    1/log(x)
```

I guess that in a more complete patch I should have added some tests like this to the doc tests. This just seemed too simple.

<div id="comment:17" align="right">comment:17</div>

According to [#4633 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/4633#comment:4), this is no longer needed in recent versions of FriCAS. Sage is now using FriCAS 1.0.9 (#9354).

So maybe this can be closed ?
