On my Mac, I was getting this error with the animate command:

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)],
xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
sage: a.show()
dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct

```
In the discussion <http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_frm/thread/526afa1bcc4b7ad5>, it was suggested that 'sage-native-execute' should be used to run the 'convert' command, and this seems to fix the problems.

Please check this on several different platforms.
