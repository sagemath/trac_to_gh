There are problems.  My referee patch includes a few failing doctests.

```

sage: a^3 + a # optional - magma
a^47
sage: a.sage()

sage: a.sage().parent()
Finite Field in a of size 3^5
sage: a.Eltseq()
[ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 ]
sage: a.Sage()
GF(243, 'a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', ''), modulus=GF(3)['a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1 ]))(GF(3)['a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ 0, 1 ]))
