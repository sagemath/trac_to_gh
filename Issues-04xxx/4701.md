There are problems.  My referee patch includes a few failing doctests.

```
sage: R = GF(3^5, 'a') # optional - magma
sage: a = magma(R.gen()) # optional - magma
sage: a^3 # optional - magma
a^3
sage: a^3 + a # optional - magma
a^47
sage: a.sage()
a
sage: a.sage().parent()
Finite Field in a of size 3^5
sage: a.Eltseq()
[ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 ]
sage: a.Sage()
GF(243, 'a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', ''), modulus=GF(3)['a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1 ]))(GF(3)['a'.replace('$.', 'x').replace('.', '')]([ 0, 1 ]))

After some discussion on IRC, wstein and I decided to review this positive and open a new ticket for the referee comments.  Apply trac_4701.patch and trac_4701_part2.patch only.

Merged trac_4701.patch and trac_4701_part2.patch only in Sage 3.2.2.alpha1.

Nick: The issues I reported stem from the referee patch which I did apply accidentally [well, I didn't read the ticket in as much detail as I should have :(] and those are already #4730 as wstein pointed out on the last comment.

Cheers,

Michael
