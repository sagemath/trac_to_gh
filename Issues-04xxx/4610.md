There are various doctests in Sage that take a while, chief among those is

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py
 [630.4 s]
```
When running -tp with a high number of parallel threads those tests end up running at the end and making the user wait a while until that test finishes:

```
Total time for all tests: 1287.6 seconds
```
Moving this and a couple other files to the beginning of the list to doctest in local/bin/sage-ptest would likely result in a more even utilization of the cores. This also annoys me personally since I run -tp 8 -long after each patch merged in sage.math and it would shave probably 4 minutes off the total time of each run.

Cheers,

Michael
