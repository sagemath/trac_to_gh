Looks good to me.

For another ticket: the minimize_constrained arguments should have x0 before cons to parallel the argument structure of the other minimze functions.  Also, we should maybe look into using openopt at some point since the syntax is then unified.

The small doc patch I attached makes the documentation of the function arguments in the same order as the function arguments.  I don't think it needs to be reviewed.

yeahr, tell me if somebody is working on that or you need help. maybe i can look into it. probably the most difficult part is to detect/register optional solvers inside sage, or talking to installed ones...
