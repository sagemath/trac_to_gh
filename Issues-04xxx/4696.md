The coercion system expects parents to be unique. This doesn't seem to hold when pickled parents are involved.

RuntimeError: There is a bug in the coercion code in SAGE.
Both x (=Ideal (x^2 - y^2 + 1) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field) and y (=Ideal (x^2 - y^2 + 1) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field) are supposed to have identical parents but they don't.
In fact, x has parent 'Monoid of ideals of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field'

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
This works now:

```
sage: sage: x,y = QQ['x,y'].gens()
sage: sage: i = ideal(x^2 - y^2 + 1)
sage: sage: j = loads(dumps(i))
sage: sage: i == j
True
sage: j == i
True
```
