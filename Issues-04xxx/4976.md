```
This patch adds the new options "fill", "fillcolor", and "fillalpha" to the plot functions,
which allow to fill the area between two functions in a plot, or to fill the area between 
the function and the x-axis.

The syntax for fill is similar to what Mathematica uses.

I also attach a file with some examples for easier testing.

Greetings,

Wilfried

I think that someone who does heavier-duty plotting (and who has a machine new enough that plot.py doesn't time out while testing) should give a final review, but it very nicely solves a lot of problems, and didn't break any of the examples I thought it might when I tried it.  After some thought, probably putting generate_plot_points separately (and with very nice documentation) is a wise idea as well, and hopefully someone who originated that code will agree.

My only functional caveat is that you may want to put in a catch for fill=min and fill=max (as opposed to fill='min' and fill='max') because it parses these as functions, which they are, but it should probably raise an error (in both cases seems to have net effect of fill='axis'), since max and min are not really functions of one variable.

There should probably also be more explicit documentation of how the fillcolor option works, as opposed to seeing fillcolor='#ccc' in the tests - all legal input categories should be listed, perhaps there are others.

But that's all quibbles and my own ignorance; this is a beautiful addition, and someone else should review it very soon to avoid bitrot.

Just a short comment about a piece of code.  The patch uses map and max/min to calculate filling to the max or min of the function.  It would be slightly faster and probably a lot clearer to just use list comprehensions:

```

sage: data=[(x,x*x) for x in [0..10,step=0.01]]
sage: timeit('min(map(lambda t: t[1], data))')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.29 ms per loop
sage: timeit('min(i[1] for i in data)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.15 ms per loop
```

It would be orders of magnitude faster to use numpy to store the list of data.  This would be a more major change in the plotting code, but here is the equivalent numpy code:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: ndata=numpy.array(data,dtype=float)
sage: timeit('numpy.max(ndata[:,1])')
625 loops, best of 3: 30.7 Âµs per loop
```

In the new patch a warning gets printed if min or max is used as the parameter for fill.

I changed it to use generator comprehensions.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Positive review off 3.3.alpha4; as we've all noted, this will be a great addition.  I did try quite a bit to crack it, but couldn't; I can't check plot.py doctests, unfortunately, so there is still the potential, but I doubt it.

Two comments: 

1. I added the reviewer patch because it was not clear that in parametric_plot, all fill options behave the same.  This is ok behavior, I think, for the parametric case, but should be documented.  

2. With the fix for max/min versus 'max'/'min', the behavior of max and min (without quotes) has changed, in a very interesting way; in fact, it behaves somewhat similarly to the parametric filling.  I think it's a feature, not a bug, which should be documented and made easily available, but that should be on another ticket.
