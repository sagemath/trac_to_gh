I just noticed that the functional_call function in the interfaces directory (defined in various files) is a bug-ridden mess.

For example

```
sage: a = mathematica('N[BesselK[1+I, 2+ 3*I], 20]')
sage: a.Re()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/was/build/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/was/build/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.pyc in __call__(self, *args, **kwds)
   1241
   1242     def __call__(self, *args, **kwds):
-> 1243         return self._obj.parent().function_call(self._name, [self._obj] + list(args), kwds)
   1244
   1245     def help(self):

TypeError: function_call() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)
sage:
```

Also, I noticed that in expect.py the definition of function_call is:

```
def function_call(self, function, args=[], kwds={}):
```
This is the typical stupid Python newbiew mistake (of course I'm the newbie that is to blame here...), which leads to massive subtle bugs.  Things are done right in function_call in r.py, and that pattern should be used everywhere else.

Positive review, though it would be nice to remove "import random" from gap.py
and it would be good to add my example

```
sage: a = mathematica('N[BesselK[1+I, 2+ 3*I], 20]')
sage: a.Re()
```
as an optional doctest.
