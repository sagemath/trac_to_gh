I just noticed that the functional_call function in the interfaces directory (defined in various files) is a bug-ridden mess.

For example

```
sage: a = mathematica('N[BesselK[1+I, 2+ 3*I], 20]')
sage: a.Re()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/was/build/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/was/build/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/interfaces/expect.pyc in __call__(self, *args, **kwds)
   1241
   1242     def __call__(self, *args, **kwds):
-> 1243         return self._obj.parent().function_call(self._name, [self._obj] + list(args), kwds)
   1244
   1245     def help(self):

TypeError: function_call() takes at most 3 arguments (4 given)
sage:
```

Also, I noticed that in expect.py the definition of function_call is:

```
def function_call(self, function, args=[], kwds={}):
```
This is the typical stupid Python newbiew mistake (of course I'm the newbie that is to blame here...), which leads to massive subtle bugs.  Things are done right in function_call in r.py, and that pattern should be used everywhere else.

I also included a fix which makes the GAP interface way more usable.  It makes the interface work when GAP functions don't return values so that you can do

```
sage: rws.MakeConfluent()
```

instead of 

```
sage: gap.eval("MakeConfluent(%s)"%rws.name()) 
```

Positive review, though it would be nice to remove "import random" from gap.py
and it would be good to add my example

```
sage: a = mathematica('N[BesselK[1+I, 2+ 3*I], 20]')
sage: a.Re()
```
as an optional doctest.
