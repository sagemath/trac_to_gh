```
## How to reproduce the problem

* Create a file called `~/.gaprc' containing the following line

```
ColorPrompt(true);
```
* Compile sage from source
* Start sage and try the following

```
sage: gap._eval_line('1+3;')
'4\n\x1b[1m\x1b[34mgap> \x1b[0m'
```

## Solution
As William Stein suggested on sage-devel (Sat, 11 Oct 2008), changing line 169 of `gap.py' from 

```
gap_cmd = "gap"
```
to 

```
gap_cmd = "gap -r"
```
solve the problem.

Hi,

any chance you can post a proper mercurial patch? The attachment is "just" a diff, but I can commit it in your name.

Cheers,
