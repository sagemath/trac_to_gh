Implements computations of properties which form double cosets. For example, if G is isomorphic to H, and m : G -> H is an isomorphism, then the set of all isomorphisms is the double coset Aut(H) m Aut(G).

This algorithm is pretty close to the canonical label algorithm, but it is a more efficient way to implement the isomorphism question. If the objects are not isomorphic, it will tend to discover this pretty quickly, via refinement invariants and examining the partition structure. If they are isomorphic, chances are this isomorphism will be discovered quickly and the algorithm will terminate at that moment.

I guess one could argue that somehow the patch includes an "add" which was not
needed and so this error is more-or-less spurious. However, this is more serious:

```
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_matrices import NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct

This suggests that a new patch is needed? Or am I doing something stupid again?

 This algorithm is pretty close to the canonical label algorithm, but it is a more efficient way to implement the isomorphism question. If the objects are not isomorphic, it will tend to discover this pretty quickly, via refinement invariants and examining the partition structure. If they are isomorphic, chances are this isomorphism will be discovered quickly and the algorithm will terminate at that moment.

It seems to me it should always return True.

If you change the script to

```

 g = G("(11,12,13,14,15,16,17)")
 for i in range(10):
   C1 = RandomLinearCode(20,10,GF(2))

   CW2 = matrix(GF(2),C2.list())
   B = NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct(CW1)
   C = NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct(CW2)
   ans = B.is_isomorphic(C)
   L = [j+1 for j in ans]
   h = G(L)
   G1 = C1.automorphism_group_binary_code()
   print i, g, h, h^(-1)*g in G1 
```
you get 

```

Wall time: 92.92 s
```
Again funny.

It should be g,h:C1->C2, so h^(-1)*g in G1 should be true
and h*g^(-1) in G1 should be false.

I'm probably misinterpreting something in the docstrings
(and probably and still too sleepy to think straight:-) 
but something seems confusing to me here.

Can someone see the error here?

First of all, you should be using a `LinearBinaryCodeStruct` for this, since these are linear binary codes, and the code will run much faster. The `list` function of linear codes seemed pretty slow, so I posted something at #4145.

Second, after playing with this for a while, I realized that GAP permutations act on the right, which reverses the familiar multiplication:

```
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(20)
sage: g = G("(11,12,13,14,15,16,17)")
sage: h = G("(11,12)(13,14,15,16,17)")
sage: h^(-1)
(11,12)(13,17,16,15,14)
sage: (h^(-1))*g
(11,13)
sage: g*(h^(-1))
(12,17)
```

So I think the first version of your function was the correct one. With the patches here and at #4145 applied, and with `test` defined as below, I get nothing but `True`s for 100 trials. Without #4145, I frequently get `False`'s. So perhaps #4145 is actually a bug fix!

```
def test(n):
    G = SymmetricGroup(20)
    g = G("(11,12,13,14,15,16,17)")
    for i in range(n):
        C1 = RandomLinearCode(20,10,GF(2))
        C2 = C1.permuted_code(g)
        CW1 = matrix(GF(2),C1.list())
        CW2 = matrix(GF(2),C2.list())
        B = NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct(CW1)
        C = NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct(CW2)
        ans = B.is_isomorphic(C)
        L = [j+1 for j in ans]
        h = G(L)
        G1 = C1.automorphism_group_binary_code()
