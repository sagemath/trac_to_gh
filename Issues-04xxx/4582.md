Guillaume Moroz wrote on [sage-devel]:

"
it seems that the sage interface to singular is not aware that Singular handles multivariate polynomial rings with coefficients in a fraction field.

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_singular_interface import
can_convert_to_singular
sage: r=Frac(QQ['a,b'])['x,y']
sage: can_convert_to_singular(r)
False
```

However, it is possible to define it in Singular: in this case, it would be

```
ring R=(0,a,b),(x,y),dp;
```

(following the syntax 2. given at http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_30.htm#SEC40)

In particular, Gr√∂bner basis can be computed by Singular in these polynomial rings more efficiently than the toy algorithm currently used.
"


I hope this can help!

It is the first time I use mercurial and just piped the output of 'sage -hg diff' in the text file: I'll check the export mercurial function and send a normal patch in some days.

No problem, plenty of us have made that mistake :)
