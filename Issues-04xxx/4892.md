georg.grafendorfer reported this to sage-support:

```
sage: a = CC(-5).n(prec=100)
sage: b = ComplexField(100)(-5)
sage: a == b
True
sage: type(a) == type(b)
False
sage: ln(a)
NaN
sage: ln(b)
1.6094379124341003746007593332 + 3.1415926535897932384626433833*I
```
The issue is that both a and b are equal to -5 (exactly, to 100 bit precision) but a is a Real while b is a Complex.  This happens because 

```
Looking at the code for numerical_approx() in sage.misc.functional,
this happens because the attempt to coerce z into RealField(100)
succeeds.  To fix this (if it is agreed that it is a bug) that
function would need to test the type of the input and return something
of the same type (real/complex).
```
The suggested fix is that the numerical_approx function should always return a complex number to the appropriate precsion if the input has type complex, even if the coercion into a real succeeded.

Keywords: **real complex precision**

Component: **basic arithmetic**
