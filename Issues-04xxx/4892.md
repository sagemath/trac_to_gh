sage: a = CC(-5).n(prec=100)
sage: b = ComplexField(100)(-5)
sage: a == b

The issue is that both a and b are equal to -5 (exactly, to 100 bit precision) but a is a Real while b is a Complex.  This happens because 

```
Looking at the code for numerical_approx() in sage.misc.functional,
this happens because the attempt to coerce z into RealField(100)
succeeds.  To fix this (if it is agreed that it is a bug) that
function would need to test the type of the input and return something
of the same type (real/complex).
```
The suggested fix is that the numerical_approx function should always return a complex number to the appropriate precsion if the input has type complex, even if the coercion into a real succeeded.

This patch causes the following doctest failure:

Given that this is vector_double_dense.pyx it seems odd.

Oops I should have tested modules/ during the review of rlm's patch.

But the doctests were indeed wrong to start with, the vector spaces *should* be complex.  I've added a trivial patch that fixes this.
