This is in sage-3.1.2.rc1.

If I do

```
sage: L = [random_matrix(GF(2), 20, 20) for _ in xrange(10^5)]
```
then my process is here:

```
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND          
15889 rlmill    25   0  446m 131m  17m S    0  0.2   0:06.30 sage-ipython
```

Then I do the following:

```
sage: save(L, 'crap')
sage: del L
```

And my process is here:

```
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND          
15889 rlmill    16   0 1471m 1.1g  17m S    0  1.8   1:02.37 sage-ipython
```
