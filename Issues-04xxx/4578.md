In short, the decomposition function on spaces of modular symbols is mysteriously way slower than it should be.  Why?

Consider this:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(1000,2,sign=1).new_subspace().cuspidal_subspace()
sage: time d = M.decomposition(3)
CPU times: user 3.21 s, sys: 0.11 s, total: 3.33 s
Wall time: 3.37 s
sage: t3 = M.hecke_matrix(3)
sage: time d = t3.decomposition()
CPU times: user 0.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.11 s
Wall time: 0.11 s
sage: time d = t3.decomposition(algorithm='multimodular', height_guess=1)
CPU times: user 0.06 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.06 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
```

This huge timing discrepancy isn't due to caching:

```
^bsd:matrix was$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.2, Release Date: 2008-11-20                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: M = ModularSymbols(1000,2,sign=1).new_subspace().cuspidal_subspace()
sage: t3 = M.hecke_matrix(3)
sage: time d = t3.decomposition(algorithm='multimodular', height_guess=1)
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08 s
```

For comparison:

```
sage: magma.eval("M := ModularSymbols(1000,2,1);")
''
sage: magma.eval("S := NewSubspace(CuspidalSubspace(M)); time D := Decomposition(S, 3);")
'Time: 0.050'
```

So Sage is nearly the same as Magma at the decomposition part of the computation, but is getting totally killed by using the wrong algorithm or doing something really dumb that it shouldn't even bother doing.  I.e., above 3.2 seconds is spent doing something probably unnecessary, and only 0.08 is spent doing what should be the dominant step. 

There are of course numerous other similar examples.   For concreteness, I think to close this ticket one should just worry about making it so that the above example completes in < 0.2 seconds instead of 3.3 seconds.

There are two reasons why this is much slower than we expect it to be:
First, the restriction of subspaces, when decomposing them, is checked. This is not necessary and already this increases the performance.
Second, sorting the resulting Hecke modules depends on computing several Hecke matrices. This we cannot change without introducing major incompatibilities. But I added an option, that sorts the modules by their basis structure. This makes the function again much fast.

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(1000,2,sign=1).new_subspace().cuspidal_subspace()
sage: %time d  = M.decomposition(3)
CPU times: user 1.62 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.63 s
Wall time: 1.92 s
```

and

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(1000,2,sign=1).new_subspace().cuspidal_subspace()
sage: %time d  = M.decomposition(3, sort_by_basis = True)
CPU times: user 0.94 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.94 s
Wall time: 1.59 s
```

Note, that the bare decomposition given in the description is not sufficient: We need at least compute two further decompositions, since two of the resulting modules are not irreducible with respect to T(2).

Hang on. Surely this patch doesn't remotely match the ticket description? If called with the default arguments this patch is a complete no-op! 

Did you perhaps want to call `decomposition_of_subspace` with the argument `"check_restrict=False"`? Because Sage's Hecke algebras are always commutative, this check is probably redundant. That would, I imagine, result in a substantial speedup.
