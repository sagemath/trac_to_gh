For a function which is constant, but not obviously so, it would appear that some computation for laying out the axis creates a step size of 0 (tick marks on the vertical axis?).

This no longer causes an error, given #5448 being included, but has a different problem, in that matplotlib doesn't just extend the axes all the way to zero.  I don't know if there is a way to fix this, though.

There's *always* a way to fix it :).

This is odd, since `plot(1, -5, 5)` seems to give an okay axis range.  Even `plot(1+x-x,-1,1)` seems okay.

Even weirder, for a second it did work on 4.1.2.alpha1 for me.  Then I exited and started again, and it went back to this weird behavior.

Anyway, the problem is probably that we fixed something a while ago to catch constant function plotting, and 1+x-x evaluates to 1 in Sage, but the trig identity doesn't.

yes, it maybe has something to do with the fast_callable simplifying things or something.

We should probably add a special case for axes where the y-range is very small.

In fact, it shows a lot of random noise.

The noise is to be expected, since it's impossible for these to evaluate exactly to zero as a float, don't you think?   But yes, the axes seems... weird.   Did the default [-1,1]x[-1,1] disappear?
