Below we compute the eigenvalues of a 100x100 random matrix over CDF in two ways.  Notices that the second way is 117 times faster than the first.  This is bad. 

```
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF, 100)
sage: time v = a.eigenvalues()
CPU times: user 9.32 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 9.37 s
Wall time: 9.56 s
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF, 100)
sage: time w = a.left_eigenvectors()[0]
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08 s

Sorry, I didn't see that the specialized methods were moved to matrix_double_dense.pyx.

I've attached a patch to fix this which just uses scipy.linalg.eigvals.

```
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(CDF, 100)
sage: sage: time v = a.eigenvalues()
CPU times: user 0.40 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.45 s
Wall time: 0.47 s
sage: %time w = a.left_eigenvectors()
CPU times: user 0.51 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.51 s
Wall time: 0.65 s
```

Thanks.  Also, in matrix2.pyx, the eigenvalues command caches its result; we may want to add that here.  The code looks good; I can't test it right away.

Note that there was not a special method for eigenvalues in the previous matrix_complex_double_dense.pyx, so the switch to a numpy backend was not the actual culprit.

I'll be able to test this patch in the next day or two.
