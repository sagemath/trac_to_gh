I've attached a patch to fix this which just uses scipy.linalg.eigvals.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks.  Also, in matrix2.pyx, the eigenvalues command caches its result; we may want to add that here.  The code looks good; I can't test it right away.

Note that there was not a special method for eigenvalues in the previous matrix_complex_double_dense.pyx, so the switch to a numpy backend was not the actual culprit.

I'll be able to test this patch in the next day or two.
