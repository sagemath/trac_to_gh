Sorry, I didn't see that the specialized methods were moved to matrix_double_dense.pyx.

I've attached a patch to fix this which just uses scipy.linalg.eigvals.

```
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(CDF, 100)
sage: sage: time v = a.eigenvalues()
CPU times: user 0.40 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.45 s
Wall time: 0.47 s
sage: %time w = a.left_eigenvectors()
CPU times: user 0.51 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.51 s
Wall time: 0.65 s
```

Thanks.  Also, in matrix2.pyx, the eigenvalues command caches its result; we may want to add that here.  The code looks good; I can't test it right away.

Note that there was not a special method for eigenvalues in the previous matrix_complex_double_dense.pyx, so the switch to a numpy backend was not the actual culprit.

I'll be able to test this patch in the next day or two.

Positive review.  I added a few more doctests in the review patch.  Doctests pass in the file.  If caching becomes an issue, we can add it later.
