Should not be replaced by

```

```
Please use some kind of verbatim environment.

* in the augment method, the "|" should be kept

```
-        Return the augmented matrix of the form [self | other].

```
 
* in block_sum it's crucial to keep the presentation:

```
-        [self |    0  ]
-        [  0  | other ]
```
is now
