## Files `matrix1.pyx`, `matrix_integer_dense.pyx` and `matrix_mod2_dense.pyx`

* the doc of the stack method must keep the two line presentation, otherwise it's not understandable:

```
-        Return the augmented matrix self on top of other:
-           [ self  ]
-           [ other ]
-
```
Should not be replaced by

```
+        Return the augmented matrix self on top of other: [ self ] [ other
+        ]
```
Please use some kind of verbatim environment.

## File: matrix1.pyx
* in the augment method, the "|" should be kept

```
-        Return the augmented matrix of the form [self | other].
+        Return the augmented matrix of the form [self other].
```
 
* in block_sum it's crucial to keep the presentation:

```
-        [self |    0  ]
-        [  0  | other ]
```
is now

```

* function _det_by_minors: missing >
