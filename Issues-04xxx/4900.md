Point counting on elliptic curves where the j-invariant is not in the prime field has been implemented up to now via the same function that determines the group structure.  The reason was that "Mestre's trick" does not always work over non-prime fields (specifically, over F_q where q is square there are always counterexamples).  I worked out how to extend Mestre to the general case about 9 months ago but did not want to contribute the resulting code until it was written up.  That has now been done, in a 4-page note joint with Drew Sutherland.  (See http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/papers/MestreNote.pdf;  it should be on ArXiV early January 2009).

The current patch implements this in a new function cardinality_bsgs().  This will always be used in computing the cardinality of curves whose j-invariant is not in the prime field.  Over prime fields it can be used by giving algorithm='bsgs' to the cardinality() function.  [The old use of algorithm='bsgs' is renamed algorithm='pari' since that's the option to call pari, which is only over prime fields.]

This also means that the abelian_group() function is simpler since it always computes the cardinality first, which simplifies that code.

Lastly, the new code uses quadratic twists, and the quadratic_twist() funtion in ell_generic.py can now be called with no twisting parameter for curves over finite fields, with the single exception of characteristic 2 and j=0.

The patch applies to 3.2.2 and has been tested on lots of curves (including all the -long tests in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves).

OK.  Actually the 'all' option does not work at all as advertised since the cached value is used.  I had to comment out the cache retrieval lines to test.

I think a better way of managing this would be for the individual methods to have separate functions which do _not_ use the cached value (as in the new functions cardinality_bsgs()) and then the main user function cardinality() can call whichever version the user wants (but use the cached value if available; perhaps only if the user does not specify an algorithm to use).

I checked and there's nothing in Sage itself affected.  In other places algorithm=pari is used and it makes more sense to me than to second-guess what algorithm the current version of pari uses.

>  * maybe the debug printing should be handled using `verbose()`?

I have no strong feelings.  The assertions are there for debugging purposes.  I prefer this way of commenting lines out;  I could delete them, but then it will be more hassle next time there is a bug.

Testing has revealed a bug (an embarrassing one in code of mine) in _p_primary_torsion_basis() as exemplified here:

```
Here the 2-sylow subgroup has structure 2^16 * 2 but E._p_primary_torsion_basis(2) only gives 2<sup>2*2</sup>1.  I know what the problem is and am working out how to fix it.

NB This function is called in ell_torsion.py in computing torsion groups over number fields, which is rather likely to give wrong answers (though not over Q where pari is used ;)) until this is fixed.  So I will make this a separate ticket marked "major defect"!
