I think one needs to check bit 9 (Py_TPFLAGS_HEAPTYPE) of the `__class__.__flags__` attribute to see if one should do the same trick as in #2777 or something like that.

<a id='comment:1'></a>I didn't though about if for #2777, but based on [http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/metaclass.html](http://psyco.sourceforge.net/psycoguide/metaclass.html), i.e. part "... if `x` contains an instance of ... a new-style class, then `type(x)` will be `x.__class__` instead of `types.InstanceType`." - I think that test like:

`hasattr(arg, __class__) and type(arg) == arg.__class__`

could do the thing, maybe not best way but it works for example with instances of `sage.rings.rational_field.RationalField`... no code to attach yet (just in-place tests in console, it's 4:30 am here) - will try to do some small patch soon

<a id='comment:3'></a>Used other approach, above with type equal class is true for too much, for example:

```
sage: type(arg)
<type 'function'>
sage: arg.__class__
<type 'function'>
```

Check like:

`obj.__class__.__module__ not in ('__builtin__', 'exceptions')`

seems to work both old and new style classes, the problem seems to be that everything is object, so best we can do is check if something is object of non built-in class

in previous patch I trusted the "everything is object" too much... so not everything have `__class__`, that's why I added back the check for `__class__` and also `__module__`, though every class should have one... better safe than sorry
