As was requested a long time ago (in september!), I did the density_plot() function.

I've added as copyright-holders all the copyright-holders from contour_plot since over 80% of density_plot file is copy and paste from that.

Applies to 3.2.2 cleanly and passes sage -t. The docstrings look fine.

I tried

```
sage: density_plot(sin(x^2 + y^2)*cos(x)*sin(y), (-4, 4), (-4, 4), cmap='winter', plot_points=100)

sage: contour_plot(sin(x^2 + y^2)*cos(x)*sin(y), (-4, 4), (-4, 4), cmap='winter', plot_points=100, contours=40)
```
and noticed that they look very similar (modulo scaling). However, there are some plotting artifacts contour_plot leaves at the "corners" where cos(x)=0 and sin(y)=0. density_plot seems to avoid these problems. Nice patch.

BTW, where can one find the list of "legal" values of cmap? For example, _allowed_options gives this:

```
    cmap           The colormap, one of (autumn, bone, cool, copper,
                       gray, hot, hsv, jet, pink, prism, spring, summer, winter)
```

But this is incomplete, since Oranges, Blues, etc also work. For example, try

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: density_plot(sin(x^2 + y^2)*exp((x^2+y^2)/10), (-4, 4), (-4, 4), cmap='Greens')
```
I'm happy giving this a positive review but am wondering about this one small issue with the output of _allowed_options. Can the author please comment on this?

The thing about cmap options is that every time we update matplotlib new colormap names become available.  The docstrings are just a fixed list and we do not update them every time we update matplotlib.

I've just opened a ticket at #4884 to fix colormap handling that includes a fix for this issue and another patch that uses the new function to do the cmap handling.

This means that this ticket depends on #4884 now.

I've also fixed a couple of small problems with the code and docs.

At a bare minimum, the docstring should explain precisely what one needs to type to get a list of all valid colormaps.  This could be included in a docstring, so that when matplotlib changes the colormap options, the docstring will suddenly break, and we will know to fix it.

Incidentally, right now one way to get a list of valid colormaps is to just make a mistake with the cmap option, and a list of all valid options is displayed.

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: z = contour_plot(cos(x^2+y^2), (-4, 4), (-4, 4),cmap='foobar')  
sage: z.save('a.png')                                               
```
verbose 0 (63: contour_plot.py, _render_on_subplot) The possible color maps include: Spectral, summer, pink_r, Set1, Set2, Set3, Dark2, prism, PuOr_r, PuBuGn_r, RdPu, gist_ncar_r, Dark2_r, YlGnBu, RdYlBu, hot_r, gist_rainbow_r, gist_stern, cool_r, cool, gray, copper_r, Greens_r, GnBu, gist_ncar, spring_r, gist_rainbow, gist_heat_r, summer_r, OrRd_r, bone, gist_stern_r, RdYlGn, Pastel2_r, spring, Accent, YlOrRd_r, Set2_r, PuBu, RdGy_r, spectral, flag_r, jet_r, RdPu_r, gist_yarg, BuGn, Paired_r, hsv_r, YlOrRd, Greens, PRGn, gist_heat, spectral_r, Paired, hsv, Oranges_r, prism_r, Pastel2, Pastel1_r, Pastel1, gray_r, PuRd_r, Spectral_r, BuPu, YlGnBu_r, copper, gist_earth_r, Set3_r, OrRd, PuBu_r, winter_r, RdBu, jet, bone_r, gist_earth, Oranges, RdYlGn_r, PiYG, YlGn, binary_r, gist_gray_r, gist_gray, flag, RdBu_r, BrBG, Reds, GnBu_r, BrBG_r, Reds_r, RdGy, PuRd, Accent_r, Blues, Greys, autumn, PRGn_r, Greys_r, pink, binary, winter, gist_yarg_r, RdYlBu_r, hot, YlOrBr, BuPu_r, Purples_r, PiYG_r, YlGn_r, Blues_r, YlOrBr_r, Purples, autumn_r, BuGn_r, Set1_r, PuOr, PuBuGn

Hi Minh,

any reason you don't want to attach those snapshots to a wiki page directly? It doesn't matter too much, but that is what we do for all the interact examples, too and that way it would be all on one host.

Cheers,

Michael

Previously, I didn't know how to attach a file to a wiki page. But don't worry, I sort of know it now. The images I referred to are now attached to the release tour wiki.
