Computation of kernels and images of linear transformations over `GF(p)` (`p` odd) and `CC` fails when the result is zero.
The patch solves the problem by adjusting `FreeModule_submodule_with_basis_pid` so that a `tuple` of generators gets changed into a `list` (something that happens anyway if `check == True`).  New doctests have been included.

**Keywords:** kernel, image

Thumbs up!

Letting the new doctests run without the patch shows horrible behaviour indeed.

Please get this patch into 3.1.3.
