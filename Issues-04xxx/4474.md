There is a dangerous hack in preparser.py. Given input file:

```
load a.sage
load b.py
```
   
Then b.py will be loaded while the file is being *parsed*, and *before* a.sage is loaded.  That would be very confusing.  See the related #4473 and apply that patch before working on this.

Component: **misc**
