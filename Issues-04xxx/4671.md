```
On OS X the Sage startup time is horrible.  Doing sage -startuptime yields:

```
== Slowest (including children) ==
1.604 sage.all (None)
0.453 sage.server.all (sage.all)
0.449 notebook.all (sage.server.all)
0.445 notebook_object (notebook.all)
0.441 notebook (notebook_object)
0.352 worksheet (notebook)
0.345 twist (worksheet)
0.329 sage.misc.all (sage.all)
0.246 twisted.web2 (twist)
0.125 sage_timeit_class (sage.misc.all)
0.125 sage_timeit (sage_timeit_class)
```

I'm pretty suspicious, because the twisted stuff does *not* have to be imported at all for Sage to startup and in fact I put a lot of effort into making sure they don't (it's really annoying that they are suddenly being imported again!)

The tiny attached patch just moves a few imports and for me on OS X reduces the startup time of Sage from about 1.64 to 1.273.  It also includes a doctest that makes sure twisted will *never* get imported on startup by default.

This is really really weird.  The *only* thing I change is to remove two instances of "import twist" in the notebook code.  The *only* doctests in the whole Sage tree that break are those combinat pickles.  Absolutely nothing else breaks (I just tested this).  If one tries them by hand on the command line they break, but if one does

```
  sage: import sage.server.notebook.twist
```
then they suddenly work. 

And those tests are not just pickle tests that fail.

Mike -- can you think of anything that combinat code uses that might somehow have something to do with twisted or twist.py being imported?
