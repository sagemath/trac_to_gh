The following is an example of the problem (which was first noticed by "Snark" on the IRC sage-devel channel):

```
sage: pts =[(-4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (4/5, 2/5, 2/5)]
sage: show(list_plot3d(pts))

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGBUS: A bus error occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------

python(2829) malloc: *** error for object 0xed2f1f0: incorrect checksum for freed object - object was probably modified after being freed, break at szone_error to debug
python(2829) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in szone_error to debug
```

It doesn't crash if the pts are converted to numerical values, although the interpolated surface looks bad no matter which interpolation setting is used.  The example points are on a sphere.

Keywords: **list_plot3d, graphics**

Component: **graphics**

Over the summer as part of the internship I learned how to do meshless interpolation easily using a technique called Radial basis functions. I attached something I wrote from scratch that works well with those points. I'll have to work it into a patch.

It may be that in the upgrade of scipy that something changed with the the scipy packages we are using, I'll have to check that, if not I'll replace that with something from scratch.

Attachment: **[radial.py.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4752/radial.py.gz)**

The segfault problem is because scipy just doesn't like multiple points with the same x,y coordinates and different z coordinates. The attached patch fixes that.

```
sage: pts =[(-4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (4/5, 2/5, 2/5)]
sage: show(list_plot3d(pts))
```
I still intend to add the radial basis stuff, but this fixes the segfault


now raises an exception while

```
sage: pts =[(-4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (-4/5, 2/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (-2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (-2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (-2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (-2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -4/5, -2/5), (2/5, -4/5, 2/5), (2/5, -2/5, -4/5), (2/5, -2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 2/5, -4/5), (2/5, 2/5, 4/5), (2/5, 4/5, -2/5), (2/5, 4/5, 2/5), (4/5, -2/5, -2/5), (4/5, -2/5, 2/5), (4/5, 2/5, -2/5), (4/5, 2/5, 2/5)]
sage: pts=[a in pts if a[2]>0]
sage: show(list_plot3d(pts))
```
works.

2nd patch applied on top of first adds a doctest to demonstrate segfault does not occur it just catches the exception thrown.

Also I added a check that there are more than three points which is required for the interpolation. This is the issue with 4818.
