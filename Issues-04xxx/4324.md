the patch is okay.
Note, that the bug can only occur, when a system is passed, which is not a minimal GB.
However, that's possible.

In the future version PolyBoRi 0.6 pure reduction can be implemented more efficiently without handling sets.
However, you will need a different workaround there

```
r=ReductionStrategy()
if not p.lead() in r.leading_terms:
  r.add_generator(p)
```
