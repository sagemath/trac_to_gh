I believe I've fixed the Gamma1 bug; I've checked the algorithm by comparing the output with the obvious algorithm of summing over the character spaces for all characters of the given modulus, and it seems to agree (and it's a lot quicker). 

The GammaH one is more deep-rooted -- just about nothing works for spaces of GammaH forms, not even the basis() method. I've inserted a dummy routine that raises a NotImplementedError at an appropriate place, which is better than the current infinite loop. It will be easy to add computation of Hecke ops for modular forms for GammaH once we have them for the corresponding spaces of modular symbols.

Thanks for reviewing this. I'd actually never come across the python "for/else" syntax before; it's a neat trick, I'll have to remember it. I'm happy with the changes you propose.

Unfortunately, I've realised that there *is* a problem in my patch: in trying to prevent the infinite loop for GammaH, I've broken something else. The loop comes up because the default behaviour for the generic cuspidal submodule class is to get its q-expansions from its ambient space; and the generic ambient space class gets its q-expansions from its ambient modules.

Now, for *most* derived classes it's the cuspidal and eisenstein subs that have this overridden, but for the "ambient_R" class, it's the ambient space that overrides it. So my patch breaks calculation of q-expansion bases -- and consequently everything else -- for forms over a non-minimal base ring.

So here's a third patch, which fixes this and adds a doctest.

David

Looks like you weren't the only one that was sloppy: neither of us ran a full doctest cycle, so neither of us spotted the fact that this causes a doctest failure in William's Bordeaux lectures. One of those specifically states, with a doctest to prove it, that computing Hecke matrices for Gamma1(N) raises a `NotImplementedError`.
