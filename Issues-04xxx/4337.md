Thanks for reviewing this. I'd actually never come across the python "for/else" syntax before; it's a neat trick, I'll have to remember it. I'm happy with the changes you propose.

Unfortunately, I've realised that there *is* a problem in my patch: in trying to prevent the infinite loop for GammaH, I've broken something else. The loop comes up because the default behaviour for the generic cuspidal submodule class is to get its q-expansions from its ambient space; and the generic ambient space class gets its q-expansions from its ambient modules.

Now, for *most* derived classes it's the cuspidal and eisenstein subs that have this overridden, but for the "ambient_R" class, it's the ambient space that overrides it. So my patch breaks calculation of q-expansion bases -- and consequently everything else -- for forms over a non-minimal base ring.

So here's a third patch, which fixes this and adds a doctest.
