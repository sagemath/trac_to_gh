For the record, thinking about this, it does seem stupid to not just use M2 when it is available, just because we can't proper doctest this.    A natural way to fix this would be to make the output random, get rid of the verbose warning altogether, and include an extra example that is marked

```
   # optional -- macaulay2
```

I think *all* warnings about "using slow toy implementations" for any algorithm in sage should use some sort of unified framework, which is different (but related to) the verbose flag.  E.g., each slow function would at the start call a function defined in misc:

```
   slow("Groebner over ZZ -- install M2 to speed this up")
```
This would print a warning iff a certain flag is set, which would be off by default.

It would be good to add calls like that everywhere e.g., in the base classes for matrices and other places where we have "slow generic code".  Then when people run code, they can set the flag and see a list of messages indicating exactly what they need to do to eliminate generic code from that a given code path, which would tip them off about how to speed up their code. 

Obviously, this has to be done carefully.  E.g., it would be bad to put slow(...) in the matrix __getitem__ method, since that would slow the __getitem__ method itself down.

I am pretty sure that the generic framework for slow generic code should be its own ticket, but I really do like the idea.

Since we will not be fixing the fundamental problem here in 3.2.2 I am reassigning this to 3.4.
