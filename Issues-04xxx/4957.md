sage: z = 18446462603027742720
sage: hash(z)
66912258
sage: hash(int(z))
-131071
sage: hash(long(z))
-131071

This causes problems with looking up values in hashtables...

This was **ugly**. It turns out that we were shifting an `int` to the right by 45 bits on a 32 bit machine, which one might think would result in zero, but in fact shifts to the right by `(45%32) = 13` bits.

The attached patch fixes this, and adds some doctests.
