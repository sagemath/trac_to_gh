The attached patch adds a plot_slope_field function and also exposes a bit more of the quiver API to the vector field plotting routines.  I wish I had had this when I started teaching differential equations!

I just applied both #4103 and this patch to 3.1.2final and they didn't give any errors.  It's quite possible that I was working from something later than alpha4.  Can you try them against 3.1.2final?

Thanks.

This and #4103 apply to 3.1.2 and pass sage -testall. It does a great job and is a very valuable addition.

A question for possibly a future patch: it will not plot

```
plot_slope_field(x/y, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3)).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
because of the problem at y=0. However, should it? A slope of plus or minus infinity has a well-defined meaning. Should one try to trap singularities like that and just plot them as vertical direction fields in the future?

Anyway, thanks Jason for this nice addition! This will be very useful for teaching differential equations.
