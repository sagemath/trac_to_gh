The attached patch adds a plot_slope_field function and also exposes a bit more of the quiver API to the vector field plotting routines.  I wish I had had this when I started teaching differential equations!

Thanks.

This and #4103 apply to 3.1.2 and pass sage -testall. It does a great job and is a very valuable addition.

A question for possibly a future patch: it will not plot

```
plot_slope_field(x/y, (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3)).show(aspect_ratio=1)
```
because of the problem at y=0. However, should it? A slope of plus or minus infinity has a well-defined meaning. Should one try to trap singularities like that and just plot them as vertical direction fields in the future?

Anyway, thanks Jason for this nice addition! This will be very useful for teaching differential equations.
