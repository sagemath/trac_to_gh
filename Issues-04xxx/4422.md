Sympow can use additional data files, but we do not install them. So create an optional spkg that recreates those data since they might be dependent on the big size as well as the endianess of the box. To get various optional doctests to pass run 

```
sympow -new_data 2

sympow -new_data 1d2
```
from $SAGE_LOCAL. There might be other useful sets of data to create. We should ping Mark Watkins about the issue.

I think this might be obsolete. When we upgrade sympow, the new version will install some architecture-independent data files by default, and generate the others as needed (caching them in `$HOME/.sympow`). The following is what I have installed from the Gentoo package, and the new sympow SPKG will be similar:
