Sympow can use additional data files, but we do not install them. So create an optional spkg that recreates those data since they might be dependent on the big size as well as the endianess of the box. To get various optional doctests to pass run 

```
sympow -new_data 2
sympow -new_data 1d0
sympow -new_data 1d1
sympow -new_data 1d2
```
from $SAGE_LOCAL. There might be other useful sets of data to create. We should ping Mark Watkins about the issue.

Cheers,
