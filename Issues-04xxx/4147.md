The proposed spkg is here: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/pernet/linbox-1.1.6.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/pernet/linbox-1.1.6.spkg)

Already succesfully tested on sage.math and on my x86_32 Linux box.

Spkg looks good to me. I added some code to touch the extensions linked against LinBox so they are automatically rebuild when doing a "sage -b". The updated spkg is in

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.3/alpha0/linbox-1.1.6.spkg

Positive review, but I am doing some more build testing to be sure the spkg actually works.

Cheers,

Michael
