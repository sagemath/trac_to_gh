We should expand the documentation for list_plot so that questions like on the latter half of this thread don't happen:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/e523b8ade175746c

Basically, we should explain how to use zip like thus:

list_plot(zip(list of x-coords, list of y-coords))

so that people from Matlab don't get confused by the very unhelpful error message.  Maybe the error message ought to be changed too.

Good idea, IMHO. 
I wonder if it also a good idea to add plot_list as an alias to the namespace so people who hunt for plot commands (and the documentation for them) using tab completion can find this more easily?
