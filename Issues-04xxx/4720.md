This patch needs to be rebased:

```
sage-3.2.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ patch -p1 < trac_4720.patch 
patching file sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 221.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/number_field/number_field_morphisms.pyx.rej
```
I will look into it.

Cheers,

Michael

Merged trac_4720.patch in Sage 3.2.2.alpha1.

Note that trac_4276-nf-coerce-fixes3.patch renamed closest_root to matching_root which cause the merge trouble.
