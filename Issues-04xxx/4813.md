Here's the code from a preprint I just posted. I tried to follow "official" style in writing the code -- comments about the style and so on are welcome.

Is this code too specialized to go into the Sage library?

Some of it definitely is; there's a function that computes columns of the tables in the paper. OTOH, I've been meaning to add support for complete matchings to Sage, and this code includes a function to generate complete matchings.

Either way, I would like this code to get put into the tests/ directory; William above mentioned "when doctests break there, we could notify the authors before releasing the version of Sage that breaks their doctests for feedback -- then they could update their papers or Sage." The paper is on the arXiv and will remain there forever (for some value of "forever"...) and I'd like to have this mechanism in place to make sure the code accompanying the paper always works.
