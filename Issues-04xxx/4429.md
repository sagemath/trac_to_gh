It was reported in sage-support, and I just experienced it myself, that sometimes the sage notebook will give an error on login:

```
Please enable cookies and try again.
```
even though cookies are enabled.   When this just happened to me, I tried
several times to login and it would not work -- always giving that error.
Then I tried deleting all cookies in the cookie cache, and login worked fine.
Thus somehow we're getting the above error when there is a stale cookie.
This is somewhat difficult to replicate, but there is definitely a major
bug here.  Possibly reading the code in the notebook that produces
that message, would produce by pure thought what the problem is. 

This happened with the sagenb.org public http server.

The message now reads: "Please enable cookies or delete all Sage cookies and localhost cookies in your browser and try again," which I think is clear enough. This should probably be closed.

OK.  I would really like to fix the problem though, since this should never happen when cookies are enabled.  It happens a lot for me when I try safari on os x.
