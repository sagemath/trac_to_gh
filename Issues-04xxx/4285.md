The current interface takes and returns raw maxima strings, and doesn't do any error handling. This gives the desolver a much more sage-like interface.

Okay, I'll have to rebuild 3.1.3.rc0, which will take awhile.
But this:

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: x = function('x', t)
sage: de = lambda y: diff(y,t) + y - 1
sage: desolve(de(x(t)),[x,t])
e^(-t)*(e^t + c)
sage: f = desolve(diff(x,t) + x - 1, x, ics=[10,2]); f
e^(-t)*(e^t + e^10)
sage: plot(f)
```

is absolutely fantastic. So far, this is great! Thanks very much Robert. 

I'll do more testing in a few hours...

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
I made a review of this patch (tested against 3.1.2) and it is positive, here are my remarks:

One issue is that in the 2nd desolve example, one would prefer y(10) to be
substituted by the initial condition y(10)=2 in the output, but this is still
better than previously, and as Robert told me there is no point in investing
too much in this if maxima is replaced by something else.

ics   -- (optional) the initial or boundary conditions (hereafter called x)
-> shouldn't "hereafter called x" be removed?

I see a few typos:
(in)dependant -> (in)dependent?
differeintial -> differential
if there more -> if there is more (twice)
variabe -> variable

Typos fixed. 

I imagine we'll be using maxima for differential equations for a while yet, but this interface will almost certainly be affected by the move to PyNaC all the same. 

wdj: there is no need to use a lambda function, you can directly write 

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: x = function('x', t)
sage: de = diff(x,t) + x - 1
sage: desolve(de,[x,t])
e^(-t)*(e^t + c)
sage: f = desolve(diff(x,t) + x - 1, x, ics=[10,2]); f
e^(-t)*(e^t + e^10)
sage: plot(f)
```

There is one more trivial fix required for tut.tex:

```
sage -t -long devel/doc/tut/tut.tex
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.alpha0/tmp/tut.py", line 830:
    : desolve(DE(x(t)), [x,t])
Expected:
    '%e^-t*(%e^t+%c)'
Got:
    e^(-t)*(e^t + c)
**********************************************************************
```

Cheers,

Michael

as a consequence, it should be ported back to the translations of the tutorial
(in particular the french one, which is in progress, see the SD10 coding sprint page).

The translation is already based on the ReST sources. One thing I just thought about was that all the documentation in the various languages ought to be doctested. This discussion should probably move to [sage-devel] so we can start designing a protocol how to deal with the new translation projects. Either way we will make the switch to the new ReST documentation for all bug the reference manual and depending on how things go we might even switch the reference manual for 3.2.\n\nCheers,\n\nMichael",
