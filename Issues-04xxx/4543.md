With 3.2.rc1, I get this:

```
burcin@karr ~/sage/sage-3.2.rc1 $ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

basename: invalid option -- a
Try `basename --help' for more information.
Exited Sage subshell.
```

On my system `basename` does not accept a parameter `-a`.

```
burcin@karr ~/sage/sage-3.2.rc1 $ basename --version
basename (GNU coreutils) 6.10

```

This can be fixed by removing the `-a` parameter on line 375 of the `sage-sage` script.

I don't really know where I got the `-a` argument -- I think I was copying it from somewhere else. Deleting it seems to work fine on my system, too, and I don't see why we'd need it. Positive review.
