I'm changing this to needs work. This ticket and #4887 have basically the same title and both have patch. I don't understand why Timothy opened two tickets and added a patch to each to solve the same problem. Looking over the patches, it appears that the patch at #4887 is supposed to be applied on top of the patch here, which is really annoying; if you want to fix something about a patch, fix it and attach a new one, don't make an entirely new ticket and upload a new patch to fix the problems in your first patch.

Also, aside from issues related to using trac efficiently, didn't a lot of work on the autosave interval go in? I thought that some patches making the autosave a lot better got merged a while back.
