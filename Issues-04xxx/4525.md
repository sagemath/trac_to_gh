The integral_points() function for elliptic curves can be speeded up if the Mordell-Weil basis used is first LLL-reduced, since this increases the minimal eigenvalue of the height-pairing matrix.  The patch achieves this.  For example, before:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 42])
sage: E.gens()
[(-4 : 1 : 1), (-3 : 5 : 1), (-11/4 : 43/8 : 1), (-2 : 6 : 1)]
sage: time len(E.integral_points())
CPU times: user 42.67 s, sys: 0.48 s, total: 43.15 s
Wall time: 43.50 s
24
```
and after:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, 1, 1, -2, 42])
sage: E.gens()
[(-4 : 1 : 1), (-3 : 5 : 1), (-11/4 : 43/8 : 1), (-2 : 6 : 1)]
sage: time len(E.integral_points())
CPU times: user 8.18 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 8.29 s
Wall time: 8.37 s
24
```
(i.e. speedup by a factor of 5) and for a rank 5 example I had a speedup factor of 50.

I implemented the LLL-reduction via pari's lllgram function, in a separate function lll_reduce() since it will be useful elsewhere.  There is a case for applying it whenever we compute generators (since, for example, mwrank does not LLL-reduce its generators, because the mwrank code has no access to a floating point LLL routine!) but I have not done that -- many doctest would need changing as generators would change.

The doctests include a long one on a curve of rank 24, which adds 2m to the -long doctest time.  If that is too long it could be deleted.

Is there any particular reason you are not using Sage's fpLLL based LLL reduction? It is (supposed to be) much faster, but maybe the speed of the LLL is negligible for your application? Just curious.

Unless I am mistaken, fpLLL only works on *integer* matrices, where the input is a basis for the lattice.  The same is true of NTL's LLL code.  What we need here is LLL on a lattice given only the real (floating point) gram matrix;  there is no underlying integer lattice.

It's the same reason why reduced_basis() for number fields uses pari, and also why mwrank does not LLL-reduce its bases in the first place!

The second patch 10903.patch implements another speedup, in the function integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coefficients(), which I have moved outside the integral_points() function (mainly for ease of testing).  We still loop through all relevant linear combinations as real points, but instead of computing each linear combo from scratch we do so in a more incremental way, since most of the time we get the next combo by adding a single point.

Apply after the previous patch.  Timings:

rank 3 [0,0,1,-7,6] : old 0.33s, new 0.16s

rank 4 [0,0,1,-7,36]: old 15.4s, new 4.24s

rank 5 [0,0,1,-79,342]: old 273s, new 64s

with presumably even better factors for larger examples.  (I still have not completed a rank 8 example, but one day I will!).

By the way, for that rank 5 example I had to find the gens first with "proof=False" and then manually use E._set_rank() and E._set_gens().  We might want to add the proof flag to integral points, just to apply to the MW basis part of the computation.

PS Since I moved the function it is not so easy to see what has changed, sorry.  Basically the old lines 4228-4242 are replaced by the new lines 4491-4526.

New patch 10984.patch fixes a bug whereby integral points of the form P+T where P is integral and with small x, and T is torsion, were missed.  Example:  in vanilla 3.2:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-1131^2,0])
sage: [P[0] for P in E.integral_points()]
[-1131, -117, 0, 1131, 1392]
```
misses x=10933.  After the patch:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-1131^2,0])
sage: [P[0] for P in E.integral_points()]
[-1131, -117, 0, 1131, 1392, 10933]
```

The funny thing is that I only ran this curve to check a claim made in "	Solving the Diophantine equation y2=x(x2−n2)" by Konstantinos Draziotis, Dimitrios Poulakis which just appeared in Volume 129, Issue 1, Pages 102-121 (January 2009) of the Journal of Number theory;  in that paper they miss x=1392!

I guess this should have been a new ticket, but all three patches affect the same function and no-one has reviewed them yet anyway...

sage: EllipticCurve('91b1').integral_points()
[(-1 : 3 : 1), (1 : 0 : 1), (3 : 4 : 1)]
```

However, after applying these patches, I get:

```
EllipticCurve('91b1').integral_points()
Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
ValueError: No point with x-coordinate 0 on Elliptic Curve defined by
y^2 + y = x^3 + x^2 - 7*x + 5 over Rational Field
```

I found with the following handy script, which anybody who ever works on the integral points code should always consider running:

```
for e in cremona_curves([1..100]):
    t = cputime(); i = len(e.integral_points()); t = cputime(t)
    t2 = magma.cputime(); j = len(magma(e).IntegralPoints()); t2 = magma.cputime(t2)
    print e.cremona_label(), i, j, t, t2
    assert i == j
```

Also, the curve 112a2 also gives the same error.


** One weird thing I noticed using the script is that for the elliptic curve 102b5, magma takes 3.88 seconds to find all the integral points, and sage takes 0.004
102b5 0 0 0.004 3.88.

Hi guys,

no need to add anyone's email address to the CC field. In case someone has a trac id it is sufficient to add it to the CC field, i.e. the address cannot be harvested by spammers in that case. 

Cheers,

Michael
