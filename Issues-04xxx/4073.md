This is related to #4072

```
[20:42] <mhansen> malb: How do you have your ipython colors set up?
[20:43] <malb> I had: colors LightBG 
[20:43] <malb> now I have colors NoColor
[20:43] <mhansen> And it sage0 fails with them and passes without them?
[20:44] <malb> yep
[20:44] <malb> I think the child process should be started with some option not to use colors
[20:44] <mhansen> Yep
[20:44] <malb> maybe by passing in an alternative ipythonrc
[20:45] <mhansen> I think you can also do it by just evaluating something at the command line.
[20:46] <malb> %colors NoColor
[20:47] <malb> I'll open a ticket

I hate to reopen this, but...the problem has returned in 4.0.alpha0 and 4.0.rc0 (and possibly earlier; I haven't checked). I have exactly the same problem that malb did, but the `'%colors NoColor'` bit isn't working. I had Expect make a logfile, and here's what I get in the logfile when colors are enabled:

```
Loading Sage library.
sage: import cPickle
%colors NoColor
import cPickle
sage: sage0=cPickle.load(open("/home/drake/.sage//temp/klee/24661//interface//tmp24661"))
print sage0
%colors NoColor
```
Both "`sage: `" prompts are colored. Without color in my ipythonrc file, I get this logfile:

```
Loading Sage library.
sage: import cPickle
import cPickle
sage: %colors NoColor
%colors NoColor
sage: sage0=cPickle.load(open("/home/drake/.sage//temp/klee/25347//interface//tmp25347"))
<en("/home/drake/.sage//temp/klee/25347//interface//tmp25347"))              
sage: print sage0
print sage0
3
```
In both cases, I did "`s = Sage()`" and "`a = s(3)`" in my Sage session. It looks like with color, Expect isn't correctly detecting the prompt.

Please don't reopen fixed tickets if the bug has reappeared, even if it seems to be the same bug. Instead open a new ticket.
