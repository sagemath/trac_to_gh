This is from a sage-support thread:

```
Hi Michael

thanks a lot! Tkinter is now working fine for me and I can use
matplotlib with the TkAgg backend
For the record, here are the steps I followed to get it working on Mac
OS (10.4 and 10.5)
1) Download the Tcl/Tk sources
2) Compile the unix version (of Tcl and Tk) as follows
./configure --enable-framework --disable-xft, make, make install
3) Modify the setup.py file in the src directory of python-2.5.2.p8 by
putting
/System/Library  underneath /Library/Frameworks at the top the
function detect_tkinter_darwin
4) run ./spkg-install in python-2.5.2.p8
5) reinstall matplotlib: sage -f matplotlib-0.98.3.p4

As this is the way Apple recommends to do it in the developer
documentation. I suggest that
the fix in the function detect_tkinter_darwin of the python-2.5.2.p8
setup.py gets included in the official Sage release. People needing
Tkinter on mac would then just need to have Tcl/Tk without
xft installed before compiling Sage.

Best wishes and thanks for the great job you are doing with the Sage
developers and maintainers,
Eric

Replying to [@sagetrac-mabshoff](#comment%3A1):
> I will do this during the upgrade to Python 2.5.4.

I did not do this in the python-2.5.4.spkg update since we have for now disabled support of TkAgg in MPL since it caused exceptions in the plotting code on systems where no X was installed and/or not running. We can resolve this problem in two ways:

* conditionally reenable TkAgg support in MPL
* fix the issue in MPL or at least catch the exception and just ignore it

Anyway, I am attaching a patch on top of the python-2.5.4.spkg that can be used as the basis to make this happen on OSX once we sorted out the TkAgg issue.

Bumping to 3.4.1.

Cheers,

Michael
