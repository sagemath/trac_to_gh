I'm pretty sure I've got all the corner cases covered, too, but one can never be sure about these things ...

Looks good to me--I had to add a "var" argument to modform/eis_series.py though, does this depend on a patch somewhere. But after that it seems to work fine (and fast). 

Also, "F62" threw me for a bit, perhaps "F6sqare" or something like that would be better?

This extra argument to `eisenstein_series_qexp` was in #4359 ... 

Yeah, I picked `F62` because it was `F_6^2` when I was writing it on paper ... should I add a comment in the code, or actually change the name?
