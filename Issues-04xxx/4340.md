The current Victor Miller basis code in Sage is painfully slow. 

I've already written much faster code, which I'll submit shortly.

This code is a **massive** speedup over the old code, and is still not as fast as I'm planning on making it. Even in examples as small as `victor_miller_basis(300,100)`, this gives a factor of 900 speedup. It's also now faster than Magma.

I'm pretty sure I've got all the corner cases covered, too, but one can never be sure about these things ...

Looks good to me--I had to add a "var" argument to modform/eis_series.py though, does this depend on a patch somewhere. But after that it seems to work fine (and fast). 

Also, "F62" threw me for a bit, perhaps "F6sqare" or something like that would be better?

This extra argument to `eisenstein_series_qexp` was in #4359 ... 

Yeah, I picked `F62` because it was `F_6^2` when I was writing it on paper ... should I add a comment in the code, or actually change the name?
