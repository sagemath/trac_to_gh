The attached patch implements -- in a slow, lame way -- Gröbner bases over `ZZ` and `IntegerModRing` as defined in the Becker & Weispfenning. This code should be replaced by the new Singular code soon-ish, but it can't hurt to have a clean toy implementation.

While I think that the `d_basis` implementation is correct, I recommend somebody double checks. Particularly, the `MPolynomial_libsingular.reduce` implementation  for ZZ should receive some careful examination.

Quite likely the attached patch depends on #4021, I didn't check though whether it works stand alone too.

Applies cleanly on top of 3.1.3.alpha1 + patches at #686 and #4021.

I *really* like the examples.
