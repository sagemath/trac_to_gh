The failed doctest was just verifying that the "check" flag could be disabled, by using this to create a bogus group algebra element that is a formal sum of things that aren't in the right group. The string representation of such an element depends on the sort order of the elements, which is completely arbitrary and subject to changing between platforms, hence the failure here.

All that's really needed is to check that the method runs; it's inconceivable that it could run but not give the expected answer. So I've uploaded a 1-line patch that marks the doctest with "# random".

(I didn't use the "#64-bit" and "#32-bit" flags as then it would just break again next time someone changed the sort order of real numbers versus integer matrices, which is bound to happen before long.)
