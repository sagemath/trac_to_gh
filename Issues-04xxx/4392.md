For number field ideals and fractional ideals, the smallest_integer() function is broken in 2 ways:

```
sage: K.<a>=QuadraticField(-5)
sage: I=K.ideal(7)
sage: I.smallest_integer()
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (237, 0))

```
First: in line 732 of number_field_ideal.py it has `self.smallest_integer` instead of `self.__smallest_integer`, so instead of caching the computed value we overwrite the function itself!

Second:  the answer is wrong (as the example shows).

I will try to fix this and post a ptach today (Bug Day 2008-10-30).

Sorry about that.  I had tried to make it easier, by using mercurial queues to merge my three earlier patches.  But clearly I am not doing it right.  Every time I uses queues I read the entire documentation from beginning to end, and think I understand it, but clearly I don't since every time I mess it up. John
