Make it so one can do:

```
sage: e = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-40)
sage: A = K.class_group().gen(0); A
Fractional ideal class (2, -1/2*a)
sage: L = e.lseries_gross_zagier(A)  
sage: L(1)

The underlying issue was one of choice of generators: you were using `K.gen()` where you really needed `K.ring_of_integers().gen()`, because you needed to know that something generated all of `I` over `ZZ`, not just `QQ`.

So I've attached a patch, which at least fixes a few issues. This patch fixes two definite bugs:

* In `E.lseries_gross_zagier(A)`, you were caching the value -- no matter what value of `A` was getting passed in! That was an easy fix. :) Unfortunately, after fixing that, there were still issues. 

* There was a subtle issue in `I.quadratic_form()`, for `I` an ideal in a quadratic number field. For instance, with just the first two patches above, taking `K = QuadraticField(-40)` and `I` the trivial element in the class group, the code returned `x^2 + 40*y^2` for `I.quadratic_form()`. The underlying issue was one of choice of generators: you were using `K.gen()` where you really needed `K.ring_of_integers().gen()`, because you needed to know that something generated all of `I` over `ZZ`, not just `QQ`. I'm **fairly** certain that the current code is correct, but it's after 2AM, so someone should double check me. 

So, now that those are fixed, we go back to the example Robert points out in the code: 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a')
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-40)
sage: A = K.class_group().gen(0)
sage: L = E.lseries_gross_zagier(A)
sage: LL = E.lseries_gross_zagier(A**2)
sage: L(2) + LL(2)
0.506799279512368

sage: E.lseries()(2) * E.quadratic_twist(-40).lseries()(2)
0.502803417587467
```

So we're now quite close. In particular, I wonder if there isn't rounding going on:

```
sage: E.lseries().taylor_series(2,5) * E.quadratic_twist(-40).lseries().taylor_series(2,5)
0.50 + 0.38*z - 0.16*z^2 + 0.0078*z^3 + 0.070*z^4 - 0.039*z^5 + O(z^6)
```

That definitely seems to suggest small precision to me. In any event, we're getting close:

```
sage: L.taylor_series(2,5) + LL.taylor_series(2,5)
0.506799279512368 + 0.360199571567893*z - 0.122141848388581*z^2 - 0.00635398874570253*z^3 + 0.0383995215484257*z^4 + O(z^5)

sage: L.taylor_series(2,5) + LL.taylor_series(2,5) - (E.lseries().taylor_series(2,5) * E.quadratic_twist(-40).lseries().taylor_series(2,5))
-0.016*z + 0.035*z^2 - 0.014*z^3 - 0.031*z^4 + O(z^5)
```

I'll cook up a few more examples and post what I find.

It seems that the Dirichlet coefficients of

- the product of Dirichlet series for E and its twists
- the sum of Dirichlet series for (E,A) over all classes A

do not quite exactly match. I have not been able to locate the error so far. It could be either in the quadratic form code implemented here or elsewhere. Quadratic forms theta series should be checked against the generic implementation of theta series.

Hum, here is the current state of affairs:

sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-40)
sage: A = K.class_group().gen(0)
sage: L = E.lseries_gross_zagier(A)

Not so good, in fact. Now let us compare Taylor expansions:

```

0.506799279512368 + 0.360199571567893*z - 0.122141848388581*z^2 - 0.00635398874570253*z^3 + 0.0383995215484257*z^4 + O(z^5)

I see some remaining things that should be done:

- maybe use the generic theta function code if it is faster than the one provided here for binary quadratic forms (as it seems to be)

- make sure that the syntax is similar to the other L-functions we have

- test with many curves and many quadratic number fields

- have an expert say something about the conductor. I changed it using my very small understanding of Dokchister parameters and it worked. But I am not very sure if it is the right answer for all curves and all fields.

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A33):

Surely such a possible improvement can be noted for later work, and not delay this?

>

Good point.  

> 
> - test with many curves and many quadratic number fields

I tested with one curve and many fields.  This led to the one suggestion I have:

- somewhere, perhaps in the constructor for GrossZagierLseries, test that the ideal class is associated to an imaginary quadratic field.  If you construct it from an ideal in a real quadratic field there is a resulting error in the quadratic forms code, and this should be more graceful.
