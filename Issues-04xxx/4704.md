There's one benefit that I see: 

```
'newcell=0' + '&id=' + id + '&input='+escape0('%__sage_interact__\n' + input))
```

becomes

```
{newcell: 0, id: id, input: '%__sage_interact__\n' + input}
```

and this is more readable (I'm hoping that the escape0 functionality is preserved).  I'd like to see what was, bradshaw, and tclemans say about this.  I'll test after finals are over.
