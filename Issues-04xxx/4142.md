As discussed in http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/7afc9f414413906 , some limits are not evaluated correctly:

```
sage: f = sqrt(1-x^2)
sage: g = diff(f, x); g
-x/sqrt(1 - x^2)
sage: limit(g, x=1, dir='below')
+Infinity
```

The last command should give -Infinity, of course, since `f` is a semicircle. At the other endpoint, the limit is correct (+Infinity).

As it happens, this is still a problem in Sage 4.1.x - but the problem is somewhat more subtle than just some Maxima bug, or Sage incorrectly parsing Maxima output:

```
(%i1) limit(-x/sqrt(1-x^2),x,1,minus);
(%o1)                                            infinity
```
BUT Maxima's infinity is not Sage's infinity; it is the complex infinity!  If the answer is +infinity, Maxima would return 'inf'.   I've asked the Maxima list about this, so we'll see what happens.

The spkg and patch at #7745 fix this problem, and the doctest passes. Positive review; this can be merged as soon as #7745 is in.
