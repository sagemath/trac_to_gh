The following `_repr_` does not look good to me

```
sage: R.<T> = Qp(5,5)[[]]
sage: O(5^3)*T
0
sage: 1+O(5^3)*T
1 + O(5^5) + O(5^3)*T
```

But that is due to 

```
sage: s= O(5^3)*T
sage: s.is_zero()
True
sage: s == R(0)
False
```

This I consider to be a bug according to the docstring of s.is_zero? saying

```
Return True if self equals self.parent()(0).
```

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
I looked into the problem. It is not due to a bug in supersingular, but due to the following strange behaviour. This happens to me with the above second patch.

I don't think that is ok :

```
sage: R = Qp(5,10)
sage: RT.<T> = R[[]]
sage: f = O(5^3) + O(5)*T +O(T^2)
sage: f
O(5^3) + O(5)*T + O(T^2)
sage: f[1]
0
```

f is now printed correctly, but the coefficient is not. In fact the precision of the coefficient is lost (and that happens without the patch, too):

```
sage: a= f[1]
sage: a
0
sage: a.precision_absolute()
+Infinity
```


Now, this looks really bad: 

```
sage: v = matrix([[1,0],[0,1]])*vector([1,f])
sage: v
(1 + O(5^10), )
sage: v[1]

sage: type(v[1])
<type 'sage.rings.power_series_poly.PowerSeries_poly'>
```

I must admit that I do not understand what is going on and if this ticket is in fact related to other known issues with p-adic series.
