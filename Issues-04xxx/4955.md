The only idea I have to deal with this is to copy all of extcode/magma
into .sage/extcode/magma say, and then have sage only use magma code
that's in .sage/extcode/magma/.
Whenever sage is upgraded, the .sage/extcode/magma would have to get
deleted and re-copied, using a facility similar to how the Gap
workspace always gets updated when Sage has been upgraded.
