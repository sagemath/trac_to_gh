The motivation for this is

```
sage: plot(bessel_J(1, x), (x, 1, 10))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='1-1/8*x^2+1/192*x^4-1/9216*x^6+1/737280*x^8-1/88473600*x^10+1/14863564800*x^12-1/3329438515200*x^14+1/958878292377600*x^16+O(x^17)') to real number.
```

The problem is that special functions, or at least `bessel_J`, can't currently be partially evaluated--that is, called with a `SymbolicExpression` as an argument.  The model of good behavior is `polylog`, for which the above method produces a perfectly nice plot

```
sage: plot(polylog(1,x),(x,.1,.9)) #makes a fine plot
```

One could use that as the "symbolic" class one and then do the usual `foo = Foo_Class()`?

But regardless of the name, I'd love to see this get in -- it will make teaching a PDE class a bit easier. (No more `lambda` expressions in the plots...) Thanks for working on this!

<div id="comment:12" align="right">comment:12</div>

I thought I'd post some work in progress for all the Bessel function fans in the crowd. There is still work to be done, e.g.

* getting symbolic integration via Maxima to work
* adding maxima, scipy, PARI, etc. to the implemented backend systems
* more documentation and doctests

but at this point the patch applies cleanly to 5.4.1 and all the doctests in `sage/functions/special.py` pass.

If you are interested, have a look at the doctests included with the `Bessel` function for examples and let me know if you see any serious problems (other than the deficits I've listed above).

Thanks!

Thanks for the comments. I finally found some time to get back to this ticket :) 

> Nice!  A few comments of the type you solicited:

That was intentional, I was trying not to shadow the builtin name.

> * I'd like to be able to plot `f(x) = Bessel(0)` but maybe that doesn't make sense?  I guess a variable is necessary... anyway, just throwing it out there.

I think `f(x) = Bessel(0,x)` is better, I don't like `x` being implicit on the right hand side.

Good question, I haven't tested it out. I think I'm going to rewrite most of the code anyway so I'll keep this in mind.

> * Maybe Python 3 string formatting?  Though I am not sure how to mix that with LaTeX braces.

???

Good point, I'll make sure to doctest the exceptions.

> * `class_attrs['_conversions'] = {} ` --- what do we do with this in Maxima, then?  Maybe it's better to raise an error; Maxima tends to otherwise just take things as new variables, which could be dangerous.

I don't know about this. I had this in the case of the single parameter functions like `Bessel(1,'K')` that Maxima doesn't have equivalents for (it just has the two parameter functions). I think I'll scrap the idea of having all infinitely many one-parameter Bessel functions registered as their own symbolic functions (see Burcin's comments below).

> * How many of the currently-deleted doctests do you think would be worth preserving in the long run?  Any deprecation needed here?

Ideally all of them. Some will need to be modified because of the change in numerical back-end.

Oh, right. I just didn't see what in the code you were referring to. I see now.

Anyway, to one of your earlier questions, with the new code I'm about to post the following conversions to and from Maxima work great:

```
sage: mb = maxima(bessel_I(1,x))
sage: mb.sage()                 
bessel_I(1, x)
sage:  x,y = var('x,y')
sage:  f = maxima(Bessel(typ='K')(x,y))
sage: f.derivative('x')
%pi*csc(%pi*x)*('diff(bessel_i(-x,y),x,1)-'diff(bessel_i(x,y),x,1))/2-%pi*bessel_k(x,y)*cot(%pi*x)
sage: m = f.derivative('x')
sage: m.sage()
-1/2*(x*bessel_I(-x, y)/y - x*bessel_I(x, y)/y + bessel_I(-x - 1, y) + bessel_I(x - 1, y))*pi*csc(pi*x) - pi*cot(pi*x)*bessel_K(x, y)
```

* Is \operatorname{bessel\_I}(\alpha, x) standard or should we just just the I sub whatever?

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment:22):

Thanks for looking over the patch!

Fixed, it was a one space indentation problem.

I was unsure about this. I think now it makes most sense to just stick with I_\alpha when in a math block.

The way the code works you have to specify the variable on the right hand side, e.g.:

```
sage: f(x) = Bessel(0)(x)
sage: f(x) = bessel_I(0, x)
```

This is because `Bessel()` returns lambda functions under the hood. Personally, I prefer having the variable dependence made explicit, but I'm open to suggestions if there are other
ways you can think of to get that functionality.

> * Bessel Y and Bessel K need a little filling out - and one of the `:math:` directives doesn't show up at all, the other isn't parsed right for some reason again

I'll work on Bessel Y and K, I realize now that you mention it that I didn't fill in the definitions there :). Anyone with good doctest suggestions for these is welcome to chime in, I'll add the tests if you can think of interesting or relevant ones.

> * I'd personally get rid of the whitespace changes in sage/functions/special.py - unlikely to have an effect, but not really necessary.

Yep, you're right.

> * How should we deal with the removal of the `"maxima"` and `"pari"` arguments?  I'm not sure if it's really feasible to have a deprecation period for that, but we should discuss it.

This is a question that's been troubling me. I don't know how to make the deprecation happen and make progress here without renaming the new functions and then swapping them in when the deprecation period is over. The infrastructure we have for adding symbolic functions (inheriting from `BuiltinFunction`, etc) doesn't support any kind of system arguments without overriding `call()`.

At least existing code that uses the Bessel functions as they are now in Sage won't break unless they explicitly use the system argument.

Maybe @burcin has a suggestion here?

> * I suppose we don't need to keep *all* old tests, but some of them are rather different and might be worth putting in a TESTS section somewhere, just so that we don't have some unexpected regression only they catch.

Good point, I'll see what I can salvage.

> * The switch to alpha from nu - I would rather not deprecate this either, but in principle someone could have used it as a keyword argument in the past...

It doesn't make a difference to me, I used alpha because that's what's on the wikipedia page :) Abramowitz & Stegun uses n or \nu and so does the mpmath documentation. I can easily switch \alpha to \nu with some editor-fu.

Some additional notes regarding your comments, @kcrisman:

- The doctest of `desolve` that was failing was returning unconverted Maxima output, that's what the `bessel_j`, etc are. With the v5 patch we now have an honest Sage symbolic function as the return value in that case (also, see the diff eq doctest examples I wrote).

- I changes from using \alpha as the order to \nu for consistency with mpmath and Maxima.

- I changed the random expression seed to 53 (my favorite random integer) and that test no longer raises an exception.

I can:

3. other?

I don't like that some are lowercase and some uppercase.  I think that the second error is just a result of that - the derivative won't function properly.

There is something strange going on. Here is sage-5.9.beta2 with the three patches applied:

```

sage: f = desolve(diffeq, y, [1, 1, 1]); f
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_J(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_J(0, 1) + bessel_J(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```

which is exactly what the doctest expects.

Now doctesting `sage/functions/bessel.py` with sage in the exact same state:

```
[bjones@cabbage:devel/sage]% ../../sage -t sage/functions/bessel.py

```

The lower cased `bessel_j` is what Maxima returns if you don't register a conversion to `bessel_J`, the Sage symbolic version of J that these patches introduce.

What is also strange is that the above output does actually represent a different form of the correct solution (modulo replacing bessel_j by bessel_J).

So what is going on here?

FWIW, sage-5.8 with same three patches applied does not exhibit this behavior.

So the correct output is:

```

```

that is both mathematically correct and what you get when you apply the patches, run sage, and execute the commands manually.

The problem is that when you **doctest** the same exact commands in the same exact sage, the output that comes back is different in two ways (explained in the comment above).

More clues: (?)

Here are the three commands in question

```
sage: y = function('y', x)
sage: diffeq = x^2*diff(y,x,x) + x*diff(y,x) + x^2*y == 0
sage: f = desolve(diffeq, y, [1, 1, 1]); f
```

1. running the commands in an interactive sage session directly after startup, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_J(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_J(0, 1) + bessel_J(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```

2. running the same commands as included in a doctest in `sage/functions/bessel.py`, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_j(0, x)/(bessel_j(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_j(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_j(0, 1) + bessel_j(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_j(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_j(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```

3. putting the three commands in a docstring alone in a new file `foo.py` and doctesting that, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_J(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_J(0, 1) + bessel_J(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```
note: same output as in (1)

So it looks like there is some hidden state affecting the doctesting in scenario (2).

I still have not been able to track down the doctesting issue (described starting at [comment:41](#comment:41)). I've tried bisecting the doctest state (delta debugging) to no avail. The problem seems to be intimately linked to the doctesting environment. I'm unable to reproduce the doctest failure when running `__all__` the prior doctests which come before in `bessel.py`, in the right order, by hand, and then running the offending one.

The only thing I can tell for sure is that at some point as the doctests are run, one of the pynac symbol tables get's modified. This causes the `bessel_j` vs `bessel_J` problem.

My inclination is to remove the offending doctest and file a new ticket to resolve the problem. Meanwhile, the bessel function code can be reviewed and become useful. I've posted a patch `trac_symbolic_bessel_v6` which removes the offending doctest block.

+100 to lazy import for all special functions, but in a separate ticket.

It would be great if you can use lazy import for the functions defined here to silence the startup time plugin.


About the doctesting framework issue: I briefly tried to debug this and didn't get anywhere either. I agree that we should move this to a new ticket and not hold this one up longer. Instead of removing the test, can you mark it `# not tested` and mention the ticket number?

Thanks a lot for your work on this.

OK, uploaded two new patches which:
1. address the problem raised in [comment:41](#comment:41), solution is to replace construction of a new `MaximaFunction` object (which alters the symbol table) to construcing and evaluating the function directly inside Maxima using `maxima.function()`.
2. change Bessel imports in `sage/functions/all.py` to lazy imports

Doctests in all the touched files pass, I'll wait for the patchbot to see about the rest.

Hope y'all at Sage Days have a chance to review the patches.

When a symbolic function is lazily imported, its constructor isn't called until the function is referenced and the constructor is responsible for populating the symbol tables that make conversion work (e.g. maxima <-> sage). So with lazy importing here, if I start up Sage and call `desolve` with Bessel's diffeq, we don't properly convert the result from Maxima to Sage because the Bessel functions are not in the symbol table (they haven't been constructed yet).

Any thoughts on this?

One idea I had is that we can register the conversions somewhere else (not in the constructors). But that would mean maintaining each symbolic function's code and its conversions in separate places (seems like a bad idea).

Another idea: import from sage.functions.bessel strictly (i.e. not lazily), but in bessel.py use lazy imports for everything that's not needed in the constructors.
