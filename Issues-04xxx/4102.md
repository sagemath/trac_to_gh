The motivation for this is

```
sage: plot(bessel_J(1, x), (x, 1, 10))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='1-1/8*x^2+1/192*x^4-1/9216*x^6+1/737280*x^8-1/88473600*x^10+1/14863564800*x^12-1/3329438515200*x^14+1/958878292377600*x^16+O(x^17)') to real number.
```

The problem is that special functions, or at least `bessel_J`, can't currently be partially evaluated--that is, called with a `SymbolicExpression` as an argument.  The model of good behavior is `polylog`, for which the above method produces a perfectly nice plot

```
sage: plot(polylog(1,x),(x,.1,.9)) #makes a fine plot
```

Nice!  A few comments of the type you solicited:

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>Thanks for the patch. Bessel functions are symbolic with so few lines of code. Amazing. :)\n\nI like the metaclass idea. That never occured to me before as an option for functions with parameters, like the order here. I have a few questions:\n\n- what is the advantage of creating a new symbolic function for each (type, order) pair, instead of having a generic function for each type that takes the order as a parameter? The latter would be similar to the design of the `psi()` function in GiNaC/Pynac.\n\n- wouldn't this approach make life harder if in the future we want to add exact evaluation method for Bessel_J only?\n\nI am also concerned about blowing up the symbolic function registry with these instances. Note that we keep an entry in a C++ list with a pointer to all the possible custom methods, and a Python dictionary with a function -> Pynac id mapping for each subclass of `BuiltinFunction` that is instantiated.\n\nBTW, I suggest moving this code to a new file `sage/functions/bessel.py`.",

<a id='comment:14'></a>Thanks for the patch. Bessel functions are symbolic with so few lines of code. Amazing. :)

I like the metaclass idea. That never occured to me before as an option for functions with parameters, like the order here. I have a few questions:

- what is the advantage of creating a new symbolic function for each (type, order) pair, instead of having a generic function for each type that takes the order as a parameter? The latter would be similar to the design of the `psi()` function in GiNaC/Pynac.

- wouldn't this approach make life harder if in the future we want to add exact evaluation method for Bessel_J only?

I am also concerned about blowing up the symbolic function registry with these instances. Note that we keep an entry in a C++ list with a pointer to all the possible custom methods, and a Python dictionary with a function -> Pynac id mapping for each subclass of `BuiltinFunction` that is instantiated.

BTW, I suggest moving this code to a new file `sage/functions/bessel.py`.

Thanks for the comments. I finally found some time to get back to this ticket :)

That was intentional, I was trying not to shadow the builtin name.

>  * I'd like to be able to plot `f(x) = Bessel(0)` but maybe that doesn't make sense?  I guess a variable is necessary... anyway, just throwing it out there.


I think `f(x) = Bessel(0,x)` is better, I don't like `x` being implicit on the right hand side.

>  * `f = maxima(Bessel(typ='K')(x,y))` turns out great, but does it convert back?  Like `f.derivative('y')` is `-(bessel_k(x+1,y)+bessel_k(x-1,y))/2`, but does it then (when put in the `_sage_` method) go back to "our" uppercase Bessel functions?


Good question, I haven't tested it out. I think I'm going to rewrite most of the code anyway so I'll keep this in mind.

>  * Maybe Python 3 string formatting?  Though I am not sure how to mix that with LaTeX braces.


???

>  * At least some of the error messages should be in doctests, maybe the ones with the wrong type and a non-implemented system.


Good point, I'll make sure to doctest the exceptions.

>  * `class_attrs['_conversions'] = {} ` --- what do we do with this in Maxima, then?  Maybe it's better to raise an error; Maxima tends to otherwise just take things as new variables, which could be dangerous.


I don't know about this. I had this in the case of the single parameter functions like `Bessel(1,'K')` that Maxima doesn't have equivalents for (it just has the two parameter functions). I think I'll scrap the idea of having all infinitely many one-parameter Bessel functions registered as their own symbolic functions (see Burcin's comments below).

>  * How many of the currently-deleted doctests do you think would be worth preserving in the long run?  Any deprecation needed here?


Ideally all of them. Some will need to be modified because of the change in numerical back-end.

The advantage I had in mind was just code reuse. In hindsight though, this approach makes the code more complicated and less maintainable that it needs to be. I'm going to refactor it into four generic functions in `sage/functions/bessel.py` as you suggest.

Also a good point. This occurred to me, but I didn't think through the consequences very much. I can see it being a problem if a user can inadvertently create a very large number of symbolic functions at runtime by doing something innocuous like:

Oh, right. I just didn't see what in the code you were referring to. I see now.

Anyway, to one of your earlier questions, with the new code I'm about to post the following conversions to and from Maxima work great:

```
sage: mb = maxima(bessel_I(1,x))
sage: mb.sage()                 
bessel_I(1, x)
sage:  x,y = var('x,y')
sage:  f = maxima(Bessel(typ='K')(x,y))
sage: f.derivative('x')
%pi*csc(%pi*x)*('diff(bessel_i(-x,y),x,1)-'diff(bessel_i(x,y),x,1))/2-%pi*bessel_k(x,y)*cot(%pi*x)
sage: m = f.derivative('x')
sage: m.sage()
-1/2*(x*bessel_I(-x, y)/y - x*bessel_I(x, y)/y + bessel_I(-x - 1, y) + bessel_I(x - 1, y))*pi*csc(pi*x) - pi*cot(pi*x)*bessel_K(x, y)
```

Dumb comments since I don't have time for proper review - and more importantly, there are no obvious horrible things (though I haven't gone in depth with branches yet).   If all this really works and there are no typos, I think this will be a VERY nice addition.
* `unqiue` typo
* `Verfify` typo
* `increasin` typo
* I don't know why, but the math following "It follows from Bessel's..." doesn't look right in the doc (the `:math:` directive is not parsed)
* Is \operatorname{bessel\_I}(\alpha, x) standard or should we just just the I sub whatever?
* ``test_relation()`` needs to be in double back ticks or have a link to the appropriate place in the ref manual
* Trac tickets should use `:trac:` syntax
* Does `f(x) = Bessel(0): plot(f, (x, 1, 10))` work, or must one use `Bessel(0)(x)`?  The example after that makes it look like maybe not...
* Bessel Y and Bessel K need a little filling out - and one of the `:math:` directives doesn't show up at all, the other isn't parsed right for some reason again
* I'd personally get rid of the whitespace changes in sage/functions/special.py - unlikely to have an effect, but not really necessary.
* How should we deal with the removal of the `"maxima"` and `"pari"` arguments?  I'm not sure if it's really feasible to have a deprecation period for that, but we should discuss it.
* I suppose we don't need to keep *all* old tests, but some of them are rather different and might be worth putting in a TESTS section somewhere, just so that we don't have some unexpected regression only they catch.

Fixed, it was a one space indentation problem.

I was unsure about this. I think now it makes most sense to just stick with I_\alpha when in a math block.

The way the code works you have to specify the variable on the right hand side, e.g.:

```
sage: f(x) = Bessel(0)(x)
sage: f(x) = bessel_I(0, x)
```

This is because `Bessel()` returns lambda functions under the hood. Personally, I prefer having the variable dependence made explicit, but I'm open to suggestions if there are other
ways you can think of to get that functionality.

>  * Bessel Y and Bessel K need a little filling out - and one of the `:math:` directives doesn't show up at all, the other isn't parsed right for some reason again


I'll work on Bessel Y and K, I realize now that you mention it that I didn't fill in the definitions there :). Anyone with good doctest suggestions for these is welcome to chime in, I'll add the tests if you can think of interesting or relevant ones.

>  * I'd personally get rid of the whitespace changes in sage/functions/special.py - unlikely to have an effect, but not really necessary.


Yep, you're right.

>  * How should we deal with the removal of the `"maxima"` and `"pari"` arguments?  I'm not sure if it's really feasible to have a deprecation period for that, but we should discuss it.


This is a question that's been troubling me. I don't know how to make the deprecation happen and make progress here without renaming the new functions and then swapping them in when the deprecation period is over. The infrastructure we have for adding symbolic functions (inheriting from `BuiltinFunction`, etc) doesn't support any kind of system arguments without overriding `call()`.

At least existing code that uses the Bessel functions as they are now in Sage won't break unless they explicitly use the system argument.

Maybe `@`burcin has a suggestion here?

>  * I suppose we don't need to keep *all* old tests, but some of them are rather different and might be worth putting in a TESTS section somewhere, just so that we don't have some unexpected regression only they catch.


Good point, I'll see what I can salvage.

>  * The switch to alpha from nu - I would rather not deprecate this either, but in principle someone could have used it as a keyword argument in the past...


It doesn't make a difference to me, I used alpha because that's what's on the wikipedia page :) Abramowitz & Stegun uses n or \nu and so does the mpmath documentation. I can easily switch \alpha to \nu with some editor-fu.

On the other hand, I don't know how to implement deprecation for the old `bessel_?` functions. I can imagine trying to override `BuiltinFunction`'s call method, or turning the new `bessel_?` functions into wrappers which call the new ones if two arguments are used, and give a deprecation warning and call the old versions if more than 2 arguments are given.

---

I can:

1. try to implement the deprecation
2. ask on sage-devel for a waiver from the deprecation policy in this case
3. other?

What say you all?

The lower cased `bessel_j` is what Maxima returns if you don't register a conversion to `bessel_J`, the Sage symbolic version of J that these patches introduce.

What is also strange is that the above output does actually represent a different form of the correct solution (modulo replacing bessel_j by bessel_J).

So what is going on here?

FWIW, sage-5.8 with same three patches applied does not exhibit this behavior.

<a id='comment:45'></a>More clues: (?)

Here are the three commands in question

```
sage: y = function('y', x)
sage: diffeq = x^2*diff(y,x,x) + x*diff(y,x) + x^2*y == 0
sage: f = desolve(diffeq, y, [1, 1, 1]); f
```

1. running the commands in an interactive sage session directly after startup, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_J(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_J(0, 1) + bessel_J(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```

2. running the same commands as included in a doctest in `sage/functions/bessel.py`, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_j(0, x)/(bessel_j(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_j(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_j(0, 1) + bessel_j(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_j(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_j(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```

3. putting the three commands in a docstring alone in a new file `foo.py` and doctesting that, output is:

```
(bessel_Y(0, 1) + bessel_Y(1, 1))*bessel_J(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1)) - (bessel_J(0, 1) + bessel_J(1, 1))*bessel_Y(0, x)/(bessel_J(0, 1)*bessel_Y(1, 1) - bessel_J(1, 1)*bessel_Y(0, 1))
```
note: same output as in (1)

So it looks like there is some hidden state affecting the doctesting in scenario (2).

+100 to lazy import for all special functions, but in a separate ticket.

It would be great if you can use lazy import for the functions defined here to silence the startup time plugin.

OK, uploaded two new patches which:
1. address the problem raised in[comment:41](#comment%3A41), solution is to replace construction of a new `MaximaFunction` object (which alters the symbol table) to construcing and evaluating the function directly inside Maxima using `maxima.function()`.
2. change Bessel imports in `sage/functions/all.py` to lazy imports

Doctests in all the touched files pass, I'll wait for the patchbot to see about the rest.

Hope y'all at Sage Days have a chance to review the patches.
