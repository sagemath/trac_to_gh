This did better (the unpatched sage failed 5 tests in benchmark) but still failed for me on amd64, hardy heron:

    In order to use the Maple interface you need to have Maple installed

      (1) You might have to buy Maple (http://webstore.maplesoft.com/).

      (2) * LINUX: The maple script comes standard with your Maple install.

          * APPLE OS X:
              (a) create a file called maple (in your PATH), with the following contents:
                 #!/bin/sh
                 /Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/Current/bin/maple $@
              (b) Save the file.
              (c) Make the file executable.
                    chmod +x maple

          * WINDOWS:
            You must install Maple-for-Linux into the VMware machine (sorry, that's
            the only way at present).

Mike found one issue while testing the patch, so he has updated the patch with an updated version. 

David: can you try again? It seems that the new patch and you testing happened simultaneously :)

Cheers,
