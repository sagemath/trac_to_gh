    In order to use the Maple interface you need to have Maple installed
    and have a script in your PATH called "maple" that runs the
    command-line version of Maple.  Alternatively, you could use a remote
    connection to a server running Maple; for hints, type
        print maple._install_hints_ssh()

      (1) You might have to buy Maple (http://webstore.maplesoft.com/).

      (2) * LINUX: The maple script comes standard with your Maple install.

          * APPLE OS X:
              (a) create a file called maple (in your PATH), with the following contents:
                 #!/bin/sh
                 /Library/Frameworks/Maple.framework/Versions/Current/bin/maple $@
              (b) Save the file.
              (c) Make the file executable.
                    chmod +x maple

          * WINDOWS:
            You must install Maple-for-Linux into the VMware machine (sorry, that's
            the only way at present).
