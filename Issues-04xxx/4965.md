The attached patches wrap FLINT's Z/nZ[x] for word sized n. This provides a considerable speed-up (~ 20x) for univariate polynomial arithmetic over these rings and also cleans up the code using the `polynomial_template.pxi` mechanism. For that `polynomial_template.pxi` was also cleaned-up which should make it more suitable for other backend implementations.

The patch update adds a simple zn_poly interface to `Polynomial_zmod_flint`.

## Performance

```
def f(p,n):
    P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(p)),'x')
    f = P.random_element(n)
    g = P.random_element(n)

    t0 = cputime()
    r0 = f*g
    t0 = cputime(t0)

    t1 = cputime()
    r1 = f._mul_zn_poly(g)
    t1 = cputime(t1)

    assert(r0 == r1)

    return p,n,t0,t1

for i in range(21): 
   f(2**47,2**i)
```

returns

Here's what is causing the problem in the ell_number_field.py test:

If F is a field of 3 elements, b=F(0), then b.nth_root(0) gives an error:

```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-x+3)
sage: F=K.residue_field(a); F; F.order()
Residue field of Fractional ideal (a)
3
sage: b=F(0); b
0
sage: b.nth_root(3)
ValueError: factorization of 0 not defined
```
The nth_root() function being called here is at fault, but that's as far as I got.

len shouldn't have been there in the first place because it is inconsistent with the rest of the univariate polynomials.

For the record: Doctests on sage.math pass.

Robert: If humanly possible can you review this in the next couple hours? Then this patch will make it into 3.3.alpha0.

Looks like you have to go down to 2^30. 

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)))
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_mod_p'>
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^30)))
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
```

Personally, I think it's a bad idea to impose a 32-b it cutoff for 64-bit platforms.
