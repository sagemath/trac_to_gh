The attached patches wrap FLINT's Z/nZ[x] for word sized n. This provides a considerable speed-up (~ 20x) for univariate polynomial arithmetic over these rings and also cleans up the code using the `polynomial_template.pxi` mechanism. For that `polynomial_template.pxi` was also cleaned-up which should make it more suitable for other backend implementations.

The patch update adds a simple zn_poly interface to `Polynomial_zmod_flint`.

## Performance

```
def f(p,n):
    P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(p)),'x')
    f = P.random_element(n)
    g = P.random_element(n)

    t0 = cputime()
    r0 = f*g
    t0 = cputime(t0)

    t1 = cputime()
    r1 = f._mul_zn_poly(g)
    t1 = cputime(t1)

    assert(r0 == r1)

    return p,n,t0,t1

for i in range(21): 
   f(2**47,2**i)
```

returns

Here's what is causing the problem in the ell_number_field.py test:

If F is a field of 3 elements, b=F(0), then b.nth_root(0) gives an error:

```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-x+3)
sage: F=K.residue_field(a); F; F.order()
Residue field of Fractional ideal (a)
3
sage: b=F(0); b
0
sage: b.nth_root(3)
ValueError: factorization of 0 not defined
```
The nth_root() function being called here is at fault, but that's as far as I got.

Some comments: 

1) Is there any reason `__len__` was removed from GF(2)[x]? If we're going to take it out, it should at lest be deprecated, but I think it's useful to have. 
2) It is preferable to use .pxd files rather than .pxi files. 

I'm still looking into why the doctest failure above, and nothing obvious is coming to mind. Falling back to ntl polynomials gives the same wrong answer, so it must be something different in the way polynomials are interfaced/used.

Perhaps `__rshift__` and `__lshift__` should call shift, it seems redundant to have code in all three. Also, I bet ntl and flint can shift faster than a multiply and/or divide.

len shouldn't have been there in the first place because it is inconsistent with the rest of the univariate polynomials.

I cannot reproduce your failure neither could mabshoff (from the above statement). Maybe there was a problem applying the patches?

Looks like you have to go down to 2^30. 

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)))
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.Polynomial_dense_mod_p'>
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^30)))
sage: type(x)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
```

Personally, I think it's a bad idea to impose a 32-b it cutoff for 64-bit platforms.
