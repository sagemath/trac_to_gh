Before

```
sage: QQ['q,t'].coerce_map_from(int)
sage:
```

After

```
Composite map:
  From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
  To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
  Defn:   Native morphism:
          From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
          To:   Integer Ring
        then
          Call morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
```

This patch causes a segfault in

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.alpha1$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py     

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------


A mysterious error (perphaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
	 [3.9 s]
exit code: 768
```
I am not sure if a `-ba` might not fix this, but I will investigate. Does this patch depend on anything else?

Cheers,

Michael
