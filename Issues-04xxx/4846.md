Often when we do fix IPython related problems things break when init.sage is present. So make doctesting create an empty init.sage so that this is potentially caught.

There are doctests in 3.2.2 that fail with an init.sage, so all we need to do is to add the check if it is missing in sage-sage when running doctests and then create an empty one to detect this particular bug.
