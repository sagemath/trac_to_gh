This is from #4639:

```
Install cython-0.10.3.spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/ ,
which contains a fix to http://trac.cython.org/cython_trac/ticket/162 and I think is 
the underlying cause here (and probably elsewhere). 
```

Cheers,

Michael

The spkg looks good, a -ba works fine and doctests pass. This release significantly reduces the leaks from #4639, even though some leak remains to be fixed. Positive review.
