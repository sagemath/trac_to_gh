I had not noticed this on trac, or I had forgotten.

The class EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup is derived form an abstract abelian group class, but does store the associated curve and the generators as points on the curve.  That is why T.0 is an actual point.  But E(z) does not work because the call() method for elliptic curves does not have implemented a case where the argument is tested (or rather, its parent) to be an element of type EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup.  That would not be hard to do.  I would recommend this:  

1. Implement a method for the EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup class which converts an element of the abstract group to an actual point.  For example, this code does that for all elements of the abstract group:

```
[sum([zi*Ti for zi,Ti in zip(P.list(),T.gens())]) for P in T]
[(0 : 1 : 0),
 (36 : 224 : 1),
 (8 : 28 : 1),
 (4 : 0 : 1),
 (8 : -28 : 1),
 (36 : -224 : 1)]
```
This also works ok when there are 2 generators, but  not quite when there are none (for the trivial group!)  -- I just tried that and it gives an empty list, strange.

2. Add a section in the function `__call__()` in ell_generic.py to catch the case where the argument's parent is an element of the torsion subgroup class like this:

```
sage: isinstance(T[3].parent(),sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_torsion.EllipticCurveTorsionSubgroup)
True
```

We'll want something similar when we have a MordellWeilGroup class to hold the whole abelian group of a curve.

This should be an easy thing for someone to do!

Looks good. Thanks for fixing this (including that very annoying bug in trivial abelian groups). I still find it annoying that it returns a multiplicative abelian group (rather than an additive one) but as is mentioned, that's a later ticket/project. 

This is a bit odd 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: T = E.torsion_subgroup()
sage: T.gen(0) in T
False
```

but I suppose that's how it used to be, not part of this ticket.
