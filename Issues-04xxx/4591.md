```
In Magma 2.13 this works:

```
EllipticCurve('37a').three_selmer_rank()
```
but in Magma 2.14 it doesn't (tested on osx and linux):

```
sage: EllipticCurve('37a').three_selmer_rank()
```

This is implemented by a script I ship that is a modified versin of a magma script.
I thus need to fix this.
