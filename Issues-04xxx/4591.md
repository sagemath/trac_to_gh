In Magma 2.13 this works:

```
EllipticCurve('37a').three_selmer_rank()
```
but in Magma 2.14 it doesn't (tested on osx and linux):

```
sage: EllipticCurve('37a').three_selmer_rank()
```

This is implemented by a script I ship that is a modified versin of a magma script.
I thus need to fix this.

this totally fixes the problem, and is much simpler and better doctested code.  it also is much faster and works with both magma 2.13 and 2.14.
