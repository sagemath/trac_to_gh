Merged in Sage 3.1.3.alpha1. It does not get the speed down to the old value, but shaves about 40 seconds off, so I will take this improvement :)

Cheers,

Hmm... It was faster on the subset of that test that I ran. There's still improvements to be made though (like when the new Cython comes out it should shave at least that much off again).
