Attached patches move `sage.rings.fraction_field.FractionField_generic` to the new coercion model, and cythonize the `sage.rings.fraction_field_element.FractionFieldElement` class. They also allow homomorphisms of fraction fields to work, and make the `random_element()` method of fractions fields return sensible results.

I will follow these up with specialized classes for rational functions.

The patches depend on #4278.

Since one of the patches renames a file (from *.py to *.pyx) it contains a git style patch.  Here are the lines you need in the .hgrc file:

```

I took sage-3.2.1.rc0 and built it on sage.math and it doctested fine:

```
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4285.2 seconds
```

I applied the above patches (all apply cleanly), rebuilt sage, and two doctests fail:

```
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/calculus/desolvers.py # 1 doctests failed
```

I reran them individually, and both still fail.  Here is what you broke:
