Hi, i've applied the patch, it's online now.

The patch was ok but i had to edit two things. Google maps doesn't know about a university of mainz, i think it's "johannes gutenberg university" but i simply just took the postal code number, that's fine and works if you zoom in. (there is also a public transport station called "universität")

secondly, something bad happens with utf8 unicode encoding in url strings [they are used in the query[, therefore no special signs in the location.

apart from that thanks and don't mind, those things just pop up when you work with the actual scripts. now it's ok and please base your next patch against the one on the server.
