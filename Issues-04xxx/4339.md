Craig, 

any news on this front? Maybe somebody else would be willing to start the review process if the code was posted?

Can I suggest closing this ticket? I independently fixed the code for the ring of modular forms last year, and it got committed as part of #5727 (changeset 11961). I've since looked at Nils' code and it seems that he and I independently fixed the same bug in more or less the same way. Certainly find_generators.py now works, and has extensive doctests and passes them all.

I'm setting this to "needs review" (if you like, I'm asking for a review for the empty patch).

Looks good to me.  I can't see any bugs, and you didn't lower the coverage score.
