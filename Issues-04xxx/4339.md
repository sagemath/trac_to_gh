Craig, 

any news on this front? Maybe somebody else would be willing to start the review process if the code was posted?

I'm setting this to "needs review" (if you like, I'm asking for a review for the empty patch).

Looks good to me.  I can't see any bugs, and you didn't lower the coverage score.
