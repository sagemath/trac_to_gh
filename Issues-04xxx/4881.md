```
The Enthought Tool Suite [http://code.enthought.com/projects/](http://code.enthought.com/projects/)
has a lot of external dependencies,

The easiest way to install ets-3.1.1.spkg is

* download the spkgs from [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/) into
a $SAGE_ROOT of a reasonable recent sage

* See the README.txt [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/README.txt](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/README.txt) and follow the instructions

* wait a long time :)

After installation do a ./sage -sh and type mayavi2 to test the installation of
mayavi.

You can use mayavi mlab from within sage by starting with ./sage -wthread

See some screenshots: [http://picasaweb.google.com/j.spies88/ScreenshotsMlabMayavi210#](http://picasaweb.google.com/j.spies88/ScreenshotsMlabMayavi210#)

The user guide of Mayavi2 is Sphinxyfied: [http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/)

AT an absolutely bare minimum I would like to see this actually work on sage.math before it gets a positive review.  I just tried and even vtk wouldn't compile:

```
-- Looking for glXGetProcAddress - not found
-- Could not find extension loader.  Extensions disabled.
CMake Error: This project requires some variables to be set,
and cmake can not find them.
Please set the following variables:
OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR (ADVANCED)

-- Configuring done
Error configuring VTK

real    0m19.176s
user    0m13.070s
sys     0m4.960s
sage: An error occurred while installing vtk-5.2
```

I then installed the libgl1-mesa-dev deb.

I do wish there could be a short quick sample .C program or autoconf script or something, that is very very unlikely to work unless opengl dev libraries, and all other obvious non-standard dependencies for building ETS are available.  Then this could be run first before the rest. 


Buildling takes a long time, so I'll comment further on this ticket as information becomes available.   I fully expect this to all work; it's just a matter of building the right dependencies.

Using vtk and wxPython we need an OpenGL (mesa is a good candidate).

We can test the installation of OpenGL at the start of spkg-install:

```
# Test OpenGL
glxinfo
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Failed to find an OpenGL. Install mesa!"
    exit 1
fi

```

I tested this by putting away /usr/bin/glxinfo. Works for me.

I'll put up a changed vtk-5.2.skpg.

Same for wxPython.

Building is one thing. Using the package is another!

I can't imagine a mesa (OpenGL) install under linux without glxinfo, but ...

So I think glxinfo -h is a good test.

If not available, we suggest installation of all mesa.

In Fedora: sudo yum install "mesa*"

Testing the libraries is not enough!

I tried to test whether or not this is the case, since right now sage.math is the un-imaginable opengl without glxinfo.  But when I tried I get that mayavi2 doesn't work at all even installed even after successfully installing all the spkg's in your distro.  But it doesn't look like this has anything to do with glxinfo:

I'm not giving this a positive review until it works on sage.math. Do you have an account on sage.math?  If so, I think you should get it to work there, so I can give it a positive review.

Does wxPython work?


```
To test do ./sage -sh
cd to local/share/wxPython/demo
Than try python demo.py
```

If not the OpenGL install is not working.

Yes, I do have an account, but don't know how to test and run X applications through ssh.

Is mesa-utils a standard ubuntu package?

Did you test that?

Let us be realistic. How can we test and run X programs without an X-server?

This packages should be run and tested on a local PC with a good configured /etc/xorg.conf, etcetera.

Maybe the following will work:

```
The use of ssh enables a secure connection from a local X server to a remote application server.

    * Set X11Forwarding and AllowTcpForwarding entries to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config of the remote host, if you want to avoid corresponding command-line options.

    * Start the X server on the local host. (running)

    * Open an xterm in the local host. (done)

    * Run ssh to establish a connection with the remote site.

           localname @ localhost $ ssh -q -X -l loginname remotehost.domain
           Password:
           .....

    * Run X application commands on the remote site.

           loginname @ remotehost $ ./sage -wthread &

This method allows the display of the remote X client output as if it were locally connected through a local UNIX domain socket. 
```

Testing this over the net is mission impossible!

I now know what ETS means! Extra Terrestial Software.

I installed Ubuntu on an old laptop. Installed mesa, and more. It works like a charm!

sage.math is not the right platform to build, run and debug X11/OpenGL based software
based on interaction!

I hope that it would be possible to use from sage.math via X11 forwarding, but the OpenGL may be problematic.  As it is, I get:

```

Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything

I ran into some very annoying problems with this package, where it appeared to build successfully but then failed to work.  I can't recommend this spkg (even for experimental) until something is done.

There were two separate issues.  Both allowed an apparently successful build which then failed to run.  The first is that some X libraries were not installed on my machine; when I tried to run mayavi2, I got the 

```
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: EnthoughtBase>=3.0.2.dev
```
error described above.

Once that was fixed, mayavi2 still would not run; this time I got this error:

```
ImportError: cannot import name cached_property
```
This time the problem was that I had installs of previous versions of these spkgs in site-python.  Once I removed those, I was able to successfully install and run this spkg.

IMHO, the current status is not acceptable even for experimental.  At least, the package should detect at build time that it did not build successfully (that mayavi2 cannot be run successfully), and fail the build in this case; and also print out some useful text (Something along the lines of "Try installing xorg-dev and removing old versions of this package from site-python", but a bit more detailed and acknowledging the existence of systems other than Debian/Ubuntu).

spkg-install now removes mayavi_2.x.y installs.

At least, the package should detect at build time that it did not build successfully (that mayavi2 cannot be run successfully), and fail the build in this case; and also print out some useful text (Something along the lines of "Try installing xorg-dev and removing old versions of this package from site-python", but a bit more detailed and acknowledging the existence of systems other than Debian/Ubuntu).

The first installs were on Fedora 9 and 10! Ubuntu/Debian came along recently.

I put in some more tests in spkg-install. Maybe this helps. I could build this package on sage.math (there are some runtime problems).

At the end I give some advice how to check the install.

See sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/sage/sage-3.2.3/

Try ./sage -sh

mayavi2

there

See my comments on #4880.

Yes, but after updating the spkg you did not change the summary, hence if you look for things to review this ticket falls off my list since its status is "needs work".

It is only for optional spkgs, not experimental. Experimental can be broken badly, there is no guarantees. It would generally be nice if experimental spkgs worked on sage.math, but given the missing X and all that it is hard to make things like this spkg work.

I have updated the summary to reflect the updated spkg. Generally there is no point in closing this and opening another ticket if you updated the spkg in the admittedly too long review time.

Citing from a comment from wstein above: 

I'm not giving this a positive review until it works on sage.math. Do you have an account on sage.math? If so, I think you should get it to work there, so I can give it a positive review.

So, I was confused in some way! Let us have some clear criteria on experimental :).

    So... do you want us to

    [ ] drop all the spkg's in experimental, or


Drop them in experimental. I think that will give them some exposure
and who knows there are people around who can help porting to OSX
and Windows. I would like to see comments in the second column of
http://www.sagemath.org/packages/experimental/

```

Since these are experimental and our standards for that are "we know where to find you if you sneak 'rm -rf *' in", but not much else, and based on Jaap's wishes above, I give this a positive review.
