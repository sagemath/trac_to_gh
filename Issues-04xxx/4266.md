Approx should fall back to mpfr if float fails.

Attachment: **[4266-sr-round.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4266/4266-sr-round.patch.gz)**

I assume there is good reason that "always return an RDF" is enforced. SR elements should probably implement round() themselves.

REFEREE REPORT:

The attached patch fixes the reported problem.

I agree that changing round, etc., to not return RDF's makes perfect sense, but I think that should be an entirely new trac ticket. 

I doctested only the calculus tree after applying this patch, and all was good.
