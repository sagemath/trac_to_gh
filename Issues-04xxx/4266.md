I assume there is good reason that "always return an RDF" is enforced. SR elements should probably implement round() themselves.

REFEREE REPORT:

The attached patch fixes the reported problem.

I agree that changing round, etc., to not return RDF's makes perfect sense, but I think that should be an entirely new trac ticket. 

I doctested only the calculus tree after applying this patch, and all was good.
