It seems that our implementation of `elliptic_logarithm` performs much worse than Pari's `ellpointtoz`.  This is from an actual doctest in `ell_point.py`:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1, 0, 1, -85357462, 303528987048]) #18074g1
sage: P = E([4458713781401/835903744, -64466909836503771/24167649046528, 1])
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=54)
NaN
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=55)
0.2735052671206336
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm()  # 100 bits
0.27656204014107100870070982517
```

Note that, while we ask for a precision of 55 bits (about 16 decimal digits), we seem to only get 2 accurate digits!  Compare this with the following `gp` session:

```
? \p 16                                           
   realprecision = 19 significant digits (16 digits displayed)
? e = ellinit([1, 0, 1, -85357462, 303528987048]);
? ellpointtoz(e, [4458713781401/835903744, -64466909836503771/24167649046528])
%6 = 0.2765620403
? \p 32                                                                       
   realprecision = 38 significant digits (32 digits displayed)
? e = ellinit([1, 0, 1, -85357462, 303528987048]);                            
? ellpointtoz(e, [4458713781401/835903744, -64466909836503771/24167649046528])
%8 = 0.27656204014107061464076203097
```

With the smaller precision, Pari knows that the result is not accurate to its current 16 displayed decimals, and prints only 10 of them (of which only the last is wrong).  We also see that Sage's result with 100 bits of precision has only 14 accurate decimals (less than half of what we asked for).

Possible solutions:

1. add a flag `algorithm` to `elliptic_logarithm` and set it to "pari" by default; given the loss of precision that even Pari's more accurate algorithm seems to suffer, we might want to ask it to do the computations with slightly higher precision than we need

2. find where Sage's algorithm loses so much precision and fix it

I tend towards doing 1 right now and working on 2.

The attached patch (based on 3.1.3.alpha2) implements solution 1 described above, in such a way that the result is very likely (if we trust Pari) to have the precision requested by the user.

Hi Alex,
unfortunately, the patch does not work yet. This is what I get before applying the patch:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py**********************************************************************

         [35.2 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py
Total time for all tests: 35.2 seconds
```

But after applying the patch (to vanilla Sage 3.1.3alpha3 on my Intel Mac OS X 10.4), I still get:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py**********************************************************************
File "/Users/georgweber/Public/sage/sage-3.1.3.alpha3/tmp/ell_point.py", line 1120:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py
Total time for all tests: 28.4 seconds
```

Thus the patch got one failure away, but the other pertains.

Maybe just use dots for the time being (see the following line) there in the doctest,
as even these fewer digits already display what you want to show (accuracy problem
of the Sage internal algorithm)?
