lattice_polytope.py, line 2677: "codeLatticePolytope" should be something like <code>\`\`LatticePolytope\`\`</code> (not your fault: the original said code{...} instead of \code{...})

same three other places: lines 2715, 2769, 2801

line 3182: change `mn` to something like <code>\`m>n\`</code>

Otherwise, it looks good to me.
