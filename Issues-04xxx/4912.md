lattice_polytope.py, line 2677: "codeLatticePolytope" should be something like ```LatticePolytope``` (not your fault: the original said code{...} instead of \code{...})

same three other places: lines 2715, 2769, 2801

line 3182: change `mn` to something like ``m>n``

Otherwise, it looks good to me.
