REFEREE REPORT:

Positive review.  Code looks solid and the result is really pretty to look at. 

1. Line 945 contains a trivial typo:

```
935	    Print a nestet list as a html table. 
```

2. The patch isn't a mercurial patch, so... :-(

Ok, let's take this discussion to sage-devel. I might reverse this patch since Jaap oberved a doctest failure that seems impossible to happen. Another reason to reverse this is that we do not want to ship a show with this option if we are going to break it anyway.

Your idea certainly sounds cleaner.

I agree, It should also do something useful on the command-line.

> Tacking random things and keywords onto show is not a maintainable solution especially since the new functionality is completely orthogonal to what's already there.

This is probably cleaner implementation wise, but I don't think html.nested_list()
is a good userinterface. Why should the user of the notebook need to know the
implementation detail that the output is produced using HTML? And the output of the
function is not really html anyway, but html + latex.

It is also inconsistent, since

sage: html(sin(x)/x)

produces acii art, and not html + jsmath.

There are already at least five functions that produce jsmath output in the notebook,
which all behave differently:

**show():**
    Produces latex in display mode.
    And works with graphic objects of course.

**view():**
    Produces latex in inline mode (which is hard to read in the notebook).
    This has many options that only work on the commandline and with xdvi.
    For graphic objects it returns a string representation.

**typeset():**
    Same behaviour as view() but has no options.

**pretty_print():**
    produces latex in inline mode.

    If used on the graphics objects, it shows it like show().
    But it doesn't accept any options, as show() does.

**jsmath():**
    produces latex in display mode.
    For graphic objects it returns a string representation,
    but inside latex math-mode.

    The docstring says that there is a option mode
    which changes between display and inline mode.

    Unfortunately this only works in doctest mode.
    In the notebook I get:

```
    sage: jsmath(x^2, 'inline')
    Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
    ...
    TypeError: __call__() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)
```
Is there a deeper reason why Sage has all these functions? Or have
they just accumulated over the years? A few of these should probably
be deprecated.

In my opinion show() is the best of these, because also x.show() works,
so it is consistent. It's short and easy to remember.
It just needs better documentation.

Would a mode flag for show() like the one for jsmath() be okay? Then
it could be extended in the future without adding additional keywords.

Grettings,
Wilfried

I attached a new patch, which needs on #5836 to be applied. The command is now called html.table(). itertools.cycle is used, there is a option to use the first row as a heading,
strings are put into the table cells unmodified and also graphic objects are placed into
the table correctly.

It was not possible to just use show() unmodified because this results in nested notebook
cells which render the notebook unusable.

The first picture is produced by:

```
sage: functions = [sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), acos(x)]
sage: t = [[f, taylor(f, x, 0, 10)] for f in functions]
sage: html.table([["Function", "Series"]] + t, header = True)
```

It is also possible to put graphic objects into the table:

```
sage: f = 1/x*sin(x)
sage: t = [["Function", "Plot"],[f, plot(f, x, -4*pi, 4*pi)]]
sage: html.table(t, header = True)
```

I hope this helps.

Also, you can try 

```
html.table([["Graph", "Vertices", "Edges"]] + [(g.plot(), g.order(), g.size()) for g in graphs(3)], header=True)
