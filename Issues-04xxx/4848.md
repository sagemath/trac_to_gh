The file sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py is mainly some comments and a bunch of Magma code. I don't see anything useful in there, so let's get rid of it.

Long doctests pass with the file and its copies removed from build.

Cheers,

Michael

What should happen is that there should be a new *enhancement* ticket that is called "add functionality for computing Heegner points to Sage".   Then the file heegner.py should be attached to that ticket, since to do that ticket, one might want to port some of what's in there to Sage.   That said, it's not so simple, since better algorithms for computing Heegner points were found after that code was written. 

So I am OK with this ticket if and only if the above enhancement ticket is created.
