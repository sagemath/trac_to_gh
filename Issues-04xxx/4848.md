The file sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py is mainly some comments and a bunch of Magma code. I don't see anything useful in there, so let's get rid of it.

Long doctests pass with the file and its copies removed from build.

Cheers,

Michael

So I am OK with this ticket if and only if the above enhancement ticket is created.
