```
If I have a point P on an elliptic curve E and F is another curve, then F(P) should work if possible.  It doesn't.   For example:

```
E = EllipticCurve([1,-1,0,94,9]) 
R = E([0,3]) + 5*E([8,31])      # big denom's
E11 = E.change_ring(GF(11))
E11(R) 
 BOOM!
```
But it should clear denominators and coerce in the triple like so:

```
def reduce(R, p):
    x, y = R.xy()
    d = LCM(x.denominator(), y.denominator())
    return R.curve().change_ring(GF(p))([x*d,y*d,d])
```

I have to give this a negative review.  This code does not treat the case where the point is 0 (i.e. E(0)).  It fails to reduce E(0) since the E.xy() will crash.  In the example, E11(E(0)) works ok since the __call__ function must test the input via is_zero() so that works, but:

```
sage: S = E11._reduce_point(E(0), 11)

```

Secondly, I don't know why this code is in ell_generic.  It only applies to elliptic curves defined over Q.  I think it belongs in ell_point.py, as a member function of class  EllipticCurvePoint_number_field.

I noticed this patch just when I was working on something almost identical, though my code works over number fields.  So I would like to replace this patch with another, not just to correct the small glitch of E(0), but to make it work over number fields.  In fact, here is a chunk of code I wrote before I saw this patch posted in here with no changes:

```
        if K is rings.QQ:
            pi = P
        else:
            pi = K.uniformizer(P)

        # Make sure the curve is integral and locally minimal at P:
        Emin = E.local_minimal_model(P)
        urst = E.isomorphism_to(Emin)
        Q = urst(self)

        # Scale the homogeneous coordinates of the point to be primitive:
        xyz = list(Q)
        e = min([c.valuation(P) for c in xyz])
        if e !=0:            
            if K is rings.QQ:
                pi = P
            else:

            pie = pi**e
            xyz = [c/pie for c in xyz]
```
This was just to get homogeneous coordinates in which one of x,y,z is a unit mod P, but then you could directly construct a point on the reduction from it.  (I was also concerned with having a non-minimal model at P.) 

I expect that I will post an alternative patch here before long.
