<a id='comment:2'></a>Only one remark:

In the introductory text, it is said "... 71 Open Source Packages ...". The count of spkgs is beyond 90 (93 I think), but that is not a one-to-one relation, of course.

Is that number "71" to be updated? (If it should, but is not going to be updated, that would be still fine for me.)

wstein`@`sage:~/sage/spkg/standard$ ls *.spkg |wc -l
88

But I'm not convinced every spkg counts as an "open source package".  Are any of these spkg's "open source packages":

elliptic_curves-0.1.spkg
examples-3.2.3.spkg
extcode-3.2.3.spkg

Definitely 71 should increase though, e.g., since new spkg's like docutils-0.5.spkg have been added to sage since I computed that 71 number.

Open source projects IMHO. So let's use the number 83 for now.

I am attaching a final version of the release notes shortly.
