Hi,

this is fixed in 3.1.2.rc1-ish:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.2.rc1$ ./sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.1.2.rc0, Release Date: 2008-09-06                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: plot(1/cos,-1,1)

sage: 
Exiting SAGE (CPU time 0m0.63s, Wall time 0m4.01s).
Exiting spawned Maxima process.
```
Please post a patch that adds only the doctest. There are unrelated changes in the patch.

Cheers,

Michael

4804_doctest_only.patch adds only doctests.  If accepted, only that patch should be applied.  This should not be accepted until the new doctests actually pass.

Thanks for the quick catch mhansen.  "Unrelated" might be a little strong, though I was bold in modifying implementation to make this work.  In any case, sounds like problem solved.
