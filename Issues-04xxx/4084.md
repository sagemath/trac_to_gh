Hi,

this is fixed in 3.1.2.rc1-ish:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| SAGE Version 3.1.2.rc0, Release Date: 2008-09-06                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: plot(1/cos,-1,1)

sage: 
Exiting SAGE (CPU time 0m0.63s, Wall time 0m4.01s).

Please post a patch that adds only the doctest. There are unrelated changes in the patch.
