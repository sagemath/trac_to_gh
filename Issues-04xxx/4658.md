* Get rid of `_magma_` and _magma_convert_. Now there is *only* _magma_init_.  The other two are not necessary.
* Add more magma doctests throughout. 
* In some cases there were three totally different caching mechanisms being used.  Cleaned this up.
* Created a new "reference" system, (see the _ref method), that nicely solves a seemingly difficult issue with objects being freed before they are used. 
* Cache all parents no matter what, even if they don't explicit support caching.  This fixes several subtle cases. 
* Made a bunch of cython code much shorter/cleaner by using list compressions.
* Fixed some ints that should be Py_ssize_t's.

To doctest this apply the one patch to sage >= 3.2.1 and do

```
cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage
sage -tp 6 -only_optional=magma .
```

All doctests should pass on Linux.   On OS X some may fail, due to bugs in Magma (segfaults). 

Since this touches code all of the tree it is high priority to get into sage asap.

Positive review. I had various discussions with William about this patch while he was writing it. 

The patch passes doctests with a booby trapped magma to flush out doctest failures without magma, it passes standard long doctests as well as -only_optional=magma. 

Cheers,

Michael
