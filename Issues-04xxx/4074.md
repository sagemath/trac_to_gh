This is because in the previous spkg the patches were applied directly to src/ rather than going through the standard patches/ mechanism.

The new spkg can be found here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/twisted-8.1.0.p1.spkg

I fixed two small issues:

* remove old `._*` crap from OSX - they must have been in the original spkg
* added diffs for the changed files to the patches directory

Positive review. The new spkg is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc1/twisted-8.1.0.p1.spkg

Cheers,

Michael
