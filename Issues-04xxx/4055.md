Seems to be something with the generic karatsuba, perhaps it should not be used for inexact rings?

```
sage: R.<x> = RR[]
sage: (x-1e16)*(x-1e17)
 1.00000000000000*x^2 + 1.00000000000000e33

sage: R.<x> = RDF['y']['x']
sage: (x-1e123)*(x-1e100)
 1.0*x^2 + 1e+223
```

I believe this got fixed by Tom Boothby at Sage Days 12, see #3056.  I'm ccing him so he can react.  In any case, this looks fine now:
