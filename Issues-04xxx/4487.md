```
Currently to evaluate a character, you have to use
something indirect like 

```
sage: G = GL(2,7)
sage: z = G.center().an_element()
sage: reps = [x.Representative() for x in gap(G).ConjugacyClasses()]
sage: reps.index(gap(z))
8
sage: table = gap(G).CharacterTable().Irr()
sage: chi = table[2]
sage: chi[8]
1
```

Martin Mereb asked

```
is it possible to imlpement something like
chi(z) or chi.eval(z) or something like that?
```

This should be implemented.

Component: **group theory**

I'm attaching a patch that adds a GroupCharacter class that wraps GAP's Character function. The above can now be achieved by doing the following:

```
sage: G = GL(2,7)
sage: z = G.center().an_element()
sage: chi = G.irreducible_characters()[1]
sage: chi(z)
1
```


One problem: I don't know how to coerce the values of the characters into Sage. Is there a standard datatype for this?

Thank you so much for adding this patch. It is wonderful!

I probably will not have time in the next day or so to referee it but can this weekend  definitely and possibly tomorrow night. However, I see a few problems. First, you are returning GAP values, but this is easy to fix:

```

sage: from sage.interfaces.gap import gfq_gap_to_sage
sage: gfq_gap_to_sage("E(7)",GF(7))
3
sage: gfq_gap_to_sage("E(8)",GF(8,"a"))
a
```

Second, and this is a matter of taste, I would name your Python class ClassFunction instead of GroupCharacter. Of course, they are the same vector space, but you can define orbital integrals and other invariants without regard to the characters, so it is just a more general name.

Third, I wonder if it would be any more work to allow any Sage ring and the value-ring of an instance of this class? (For example, polynomial-valued class functions?)

Finally, I wonder if you could also create a much more general class of ring-valued functions on a group? I don't know what use this would be off-hand but maybe one could use it in case one if not sure if the function is a class function or not?

Anyway, just a few ideas to think about if you want, but thanks again for the very useful addition.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

First, I am running sage on ubuntu 8.10 where doctesting seems to be broken, so I have not tested this.

I like this addition so much, I am going to give it a positive review once one important change is made.

This output:

```
sage: G = GL(2,3)
sage: irrs = G.irreducible_characters()
sage: chi1 = irrs[3]; chi1
Character of General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3
sage: g = G.conjugacy_class_representatives()[6]
sage: chi1(g)
E(8)+E(8)^3
```
is unacceptable, IMHO, because it is easy to fix and (as the author himself noted) should be a Sage value.

In addition to the things I noted above which might be changed but don't have to be (yet or ever), is the following somewhat odd behaviour:

```
sage: len(G.conjugacy_class_representatives())
8
sage: chi2 = GroupCharacter(G, [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1])
sage: chi2.irreducible_constituents()
[]
sage: chi2 = GroupCharacter(G, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1, 1, 1])
sage: chi2.irreducible_constituents()
[Character of General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3]
sage: chi2 = GroupCharacter(G, [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
sage: chi2.irreducible_constituents()
[Character of General Linear Group of degree 2 over Finite Field of size 3]
```
It seems to be a coefficient is missing somewhere here. (I agree that this simply interfaces with GAP, but still!) Anyway, this can be fixed later and I want to minimize the required work so this can be included in Sage ASAP.

```
sage: G = GL(2,3)
sage: chi = G.irreducible_characters()[3]
sage: g = G.conjugacy_class_representatives()[6]
sage: chi(g)
zeta8^3 + zeta8
```

* Unfortunately, though, it seems that Cyclotomic field elements aren't converted to GAP elements correctly, so using them as values won't work.

```
sage: G = GL(2,3)
sage: z = CyclotomicField(8).an_element; z
zeta8
sage: values = [2, 1, -2, -1, 0, -z^3 - z, z^3 + z, 0]
sage: xi = gap.ClassFunction(G, values); xi
ClassFunction( CharacterTable( GL(2,3) ),
[ 2, 1, -2, -1, 0, (-1*zeta8-1*zeta8^3), (zeta8+zeta8^3), 0 ] )
sage: ClassFunction(G, values)
Traceback: ...
```
I think this might be a bug:

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(8)
sage: z = K.an_element; z
zeta8
sage: K(gap.E(8))
zeta8
sage: K(gap.E(8)) == z
True
sage: gap(z)
(zeta8)
sage: gap.E(8) == gap(z)
False
sage: gap(z)**4
!-1
```
I'm not sure what !-1 means. Any ideas?

I am not quite sure what is going on here, but I guess we need to sort the generators at some point.

Hello Michael,

The `__repr__` for this class just returns "Character of" plus the string representation of the group. So perhaps something changed in subgroup between 3.2.rc1 and 3.2?

Anyhow, I posted a patch to correct the docstring. Apply on top of class_functions_4487.patch.
