At http://sagemath.org/development-map.html we have the "US (East, West, UW)" and "Europe", but we are missing "South America", "Asia" and "Australia". Sine we are in the processing of adding quite a number of people to Australia as well as another person to Korea it would be good to add those links. 

Adding the people itself is #4682. 

I am opening these tickets so Harald gets proper credit for his work on the website :)

Cheers,

Michael
