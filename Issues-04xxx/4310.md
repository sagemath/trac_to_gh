Grammar comment: "Deprecate" is spelled with an e in the middle, not an i.

Did you know that "deprecate" used to mean "to pray against" (as an evil) and comes from the latin roots de + precari (precari="to pray").  I just learned that when I looked it up.  It certainly adds emphasis to deprecation statements if people are praying against the evil of whatever is being deprecated!  See http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deprecate

After a rebase and rebuild caused by parent.pxd, I think this is good.  It simplifies the coercion interface a fair amount.

Apply only trac_4310.patch

Minor nitpick from before still applies to trac_4310: Deprecate is spelled "Depricate" in the patch.  I wouldn't let that hold up the patch going in; just pointing it out.
