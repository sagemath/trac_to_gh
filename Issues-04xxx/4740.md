Burcin reported at #4639:

```
sage: F = GF(13)
sage: get_memory_usage()
708.02734375
sage: for _ in xrange(10000):
....:     t = F.coerce(F(234234))
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
728.15234375
sage: for _ in xrange(100000):
    t = F.coerce(F(234234))
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
932.3125
sage: for _ in xrange(100000):
    t = F.coerce(F(234234))
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
1136.35546875
```
Since the patch by RobertWB at that ticket fixes the issue Burcin reported, but not the original one I am moving it over to this ticket.

Cheers,

Robert,

the leak seems to be gone in 3.2.2:

```

Should we close this ticket as won't fix or is the patch her still relevant? In that case we should update the ticket to reflect the actual issue being fixed here.

The patch is still relevant here. What is going on is every time coerce is called, a new homset is created. Creating a new homset doesn't leak anymore, but it's still sub-optimal. 

I don't know that I'll have time to look into this anytime soon, but it's not a blocker anymore as the leak is solved elsewhere.

Hi Robert,

accidentally I found this rather old ticket.

Replying to [robertwb](#comment%3A5):
> The patch is still relevant here. What is going on is every time coerce is called, a new homset is created. Creating a new homset doesn't leak anymore, but it's still sub-optimal. 


Is this still the case? In what situation is the homset created? Is it not cached? In what files does it occur?

Cheers,
Simon

I think homesets are still created each time.  We could try the following patch which does fix the issue.  The timings also improved:

Before:

```
sage: %timeit t = F.coerce(F(234234))
10000 loops, best of 3: 197 us per loop
```

After:

```
sage: %timeit t = F.coerce(F(234234))
10000 loops, best of 3: 23.4 us per loop
```

Simon -- see any issues here?

Yes, and a quite severe issue.

The problem is, as often, unique versus non-unique parent structures. For coercion, we need that the domain and codomain of a coercion from A to B are not just equal but identical to A and B. But with `UniqueRepresentation`, the given input arguments are compared by equality, not by identity. That's why it was a conscious decision to use `TripleDict` for caching homsets.

The cache is provided by the `Hom()` function in sage.categories.homset. If homsets are really created over and over again, then there seems to be a rogue call to `Homset(...)`. The solution is not to make `Homset` a cached class, but to call the `Hom()` function instead.

Interesting. I found the following, by inserting a print statement into `Homset.__init__`:

```
sage: F = GF(13)
sage: x = F(234234)
calling Homset Integer Ring Finite Field of size 13 Category of euclidean domains
sage: x = F(234234)   # the homset is created only once, which is fine
sage: t = F.coerce(F(234234))   # there is a homset created...
calling Homset Finite Field of size 13 Finite Field of size 13 Category of rings
sage: t = F.coerce(F(234234))   # ... repeatedly
calling Homset Finite Field of size 13 Finite Field of size 13 Category of rings
sage: t = F.coerce(F(234234))
calling Homset Finite Field of size 13 Finite Field of size 13 Category of rings
sage: I = F.coerce_map_from(F)  # creating a coerce map, the homset is created again, but...
calling Homset Finite Field of size 13 Finite Field of size 13 Category of rings
sage: t = F.coerce(F(234234))   # ... now the problem is fixed!
sage: t = F.coerce(F(234234))
```

This seems to suggest that
1. `F.coerce` seems to use a cached coerce map from F to F, but if it isn't cached, it would create the coerce map repeatedly.
2. It re-creates the coercion map such that the parent of the coercion map is re-created as well.

Look at the following snippet from `Parent.coerce_map_from(self,S)`:

```python
        if S == self:
            # non-unique parents
            if unique_parent_warnings:
                print "Warning: non-unique parents %s"%(type(S))
            return self._generic_convert_map(S)
```
`self._generic_convert_map(S)` does not do caching.

Hence, the general problem is: A coercion from self to self will never be cached.

I see two potential solutions, and the "info" I am seeking is: What would you prefer?

We could

1. let `F.coerce_map_from(F)` use the cache (I think this is what I would prefer), or
2. let `F.coerce(x)` avoid creating a morphism, if the parent of x is F.

It might even make sense to do both, 2. for efficiency.
