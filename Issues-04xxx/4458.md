Perhaps even a blurb about variables being references (if it's not to complicated). However, at the very least there should be something in the calculus section(s) to the effect of "If you get a NameError, check to see if you either misspelled something or forgot to define a variable with var(...)"

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hello! 

Sorry for not being complete last time. I have one last comment, I am really sorry for doing this:

The description in the patch says: 'at the very least there should be something in the calculus section(s) to the effect of "If you get a NameError?, check to see if you either misspelled something or forgot to define a variable with var(...)"'. 

I think this could be done, by adding a note. Can you please do this, so that there is an explicit place where this is explained? I am also thinking if it might be possible to implement the first suggestion in the description. Hope you'd find an appropriate place to do so.

<a id='comment:12'></a>I feel like these are ... a little dangerous.

First, 

```
are defined to be ``var(...)``
```
Is there a noun missing here?  Or "via", or "exist using"?

```
sage: diff(sin(var('u')), var('u'))
```
I'm a little leery of suggesting people do this.  `var('u')` injects things into the global namespace as well, so this is redundant.  Better is

```
sage: var('u')
diff(...)
```

Also, I suspect you'll need an extra line before the new section

```
.. _section-systems: 
```
to avoid some documentation build error.

I didn't know this happened! That's pretty neat. Why do we have

```
u = var('u')
```
in the tutorial then? Is 

```
var('u')
```
shorthand for u = var('u'), or does it do something a little different?
