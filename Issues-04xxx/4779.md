I've posted a 100% doctest patch that creates lots of random rings, elements, and does arithmetic with them. 

Of course, there are numerous more rings that can be added.  But I think this is a good and very useful first step.


This patch has zero overlap with anything else, so is fairly safe to apply.   The only problem could be that the new random doctests in this patch could potentially expose some bugs, which of course would be good.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

Looks good to me. One tiny issue probably worth fixing: The docstring says:

```
Create a random prime finite field with cardinality at most 10^20. 
```
But you create

```
GF(ZZ.random_element(x=2, y=10**20).next_prime())
```
So it is likely, but extremely unlikely that this will happen:

```
sage: ZZ.random_element(x=10**20-1, y=10**20).next_prime()
100000000000000000039
```
There is an analog issue further down in another docstring IIRC.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

* I agree with mabshoff's comment on `next_prime` 
* there is a copy'n'paste error in the docstring of rings0
* shouldn't "RINGS" in `rings0` mention number fields and GF(p<sup>n</sup>)?
