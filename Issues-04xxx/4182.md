Here's a patch.  I was getting an index error in the last line in this code snippet:

```
                span = len(texture) / (max_z - min_z)    # max to avoid dividing by 0
            parts = P.partition(lambda x,y,z: int((z-min_z)*span))
        all = []
        for k, G in parts.iteritems():
            G.set_texture(texture[k], opacity=opacity)
```
The function g(x,y) described above is discontinuous at various places, and I think this was making the `k` in the last line of this snippet equal to 128 while `len(texture)` was also 128. Changing the definition of `span` in the first line, as this patch does, I hope should make `k` always strictly less than `len(texture)`.
