This is a triviality, but I noticed it while doing something else. All order in number fields have Krull dimension 1, but this was not implemented -- not even for the maximal order.  Now it is.

Patch based on 3.2.rc1, touches rings/ring.pyx and rings/number_field/order.py

This looks good.

As a really trivial issue, someone should add a `.` at the end of line 754 of `ring.pyx`. It didn't seem worth another patch.
