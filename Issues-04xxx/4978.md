spkg-install has the following:

```
    # Do performance tuning steps.
    if [ `uname` = "Linux" -a `uname -m` = "ppc64" ]; then
        echo "NTL auto tuning is broken on Linux ppc64.  Please report this to Victor Shoup.  Thanks."
    else
        do_tune
    fi
```
I cannot imagine the tuning code being broken and even if it is the spkg should still at least build, so fix it.

Cheers,

Michael
