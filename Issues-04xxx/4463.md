The doctests in modular/abvar/homspace.py timeout on my PPC mac, so something in there takes long enough that it should get the "# long time" comment.

Some speedups for computation of endomorphism rings of modular abelian varieties. This patch just makes one or two easy changes; much work remains. However, it gives a noticeable speedup (at least on my machine): testing `sage/modular/abvar/homspace.py` drops from ~150s to ~100s. This should at least stop the timeouts people keep running into.
