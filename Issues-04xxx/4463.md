The doctests in modular/abvar/homspace.py timeout on my PPC mac, so something in there takes long enough that it should get the "# long time" comment.

For the record, the two optimizations in the above patch:

* for computing endomorphism ring generators for a one dimensional abelian variety, simply return the answer, and 
* if we're intersecting a space of modular symbols with `ZZ^n`, simply take the appropriate submodule instead of doing any linear algebra.
