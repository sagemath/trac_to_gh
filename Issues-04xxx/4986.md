It is currently way to easy to introduce circular imports in Sage, and a mess to try and hunt time down. An order in which things are imported is found in sage.all, but due to the cascade of imports in sage.misc (and elsewhere) this is not an accurate representation of what actually happens. This could stand to be cleaned up a lot. Ideally, little/none of sage.foo.* should be used before sage.foo.all is imported. 

This patch prints out imports as they happen, and where they're initiated.

I guess the patch isn't posted yet, but this seems like "sage -startuptime" which prints out imports as they occur.

Yes, it is a lot like sage -startuptime. One difference is that it prints out where each import is coming from, and also filters based on whether or not the corresponding *.all module has been loaded.

Re: sage-devel thread: I was wondering what you were waiting for.

(Haven't tested the patch here; I think you won't be able to print PARI's variables with this method anyway, at least not easily.)

Note that you can inject code into the C files generated by Cython, e.g. with your favourite friend `sed`, especially into the functions called upon module initialization:

```sh
$ cd devel/sage/sage/rings
$ sed -i -e '/^PyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_.*(void)$/,+3s/^{$/{\n  printf("Hello!\\n");\n/' real_mpfr.c
$ ../../../../sage -br
