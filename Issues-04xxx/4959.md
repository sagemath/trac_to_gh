I had a similar failure today, trying to:

r.install_packages("adapt")

after some fussing, runing ./sage as root, and using the notebook
interface I could get through the download phase, but same sorts of
failures in just as the gcc kicks in.  Seems several of the key R
scripts have "/home/wstein/..."  hard wired in to R_HOME_XXX, which
obviously will fail.  I tried editing the R startup scripts (among
others) but couldn't get it to work.

BTW, I installed from the latest Debian tarball into a Debian/VMWARE
machine just today.  So installing R packages is still an issue.
```

Since most of the value of R is the huge list of third party packages, it's very important that this get fixed.

Here is another interesting error which might help us - is it possible that a number of R packages require non-universal libraries?
