I would like to use pari's galois computations (such as nfgaloisconj) and finer number field functions (such as nfroots).  The interface (in sage.libs.pari.gen) needs to be upgraded.

**Assignee:** @williamstein

This is a step in the right direction -- exposes nfgaloisconj and nfroots, and adds automorphisms/updates embeddings to be much faster for number fields.

Try it with a large degree number field -- you couldn't compute K.embeddings(K) for suff. large K, but now you can.

All I did was rebase Nick's patch against 3.4.1.rc2.  (ok, I also rest-ified a couple of his docstrings.)

One issue was that the original patch seems to have had a lot of things in double.  This is now fixed, hence the difference in size.

The code looks good to me and is nicely documented.  Positive review.
