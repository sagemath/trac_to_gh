I have attached a diff (not a patch) against 3.1.2.rc2 since not all fixes do apply any more due to the rewrite of the manual by John Palmieri. I left out the fix 

```
 There is one subtlety in defining complex numbers: as mentioned above, 
-the symbol \code{i} represents a square root of \minusone, but it is a 
+the symbol \code{i} represents the square root of \minusone, but it is a 
 \emph{formal} square root of \minusone; it is not in the complex numbers. 
 Calling \code{CC(i)} returns the complex square root of \minusone.
```
since there are multiple roots.

Cheers,

Michael
