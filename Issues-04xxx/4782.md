Try this carefully with your finger on kill -9:

```
sage: NumberField(x^2 + 79*x - 60, 'a').extension(x^2 - 69*x + 38,'b')
```

On sage.math top shows pretty quickly over 6.9GB memory usage!

```
15392 was       25   0 8219m 6.9g  21m R  100 10.9   0:53.76 sage-ipython                                                    
```

The discriminants aren't very big:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: disc(x^2 + 79*x-60)
6481
sage: disc(x^2 - 69*x + 38)
4609
```

Same behavior with Proof false:

```
sage: proof.all(False)
sage: NumberField(x^2 + 79*x - 60, 'a').extension(x^2 - 69*x + 38,'b')
...hell....
```

Giving both polys at once (which maybe use polcompositum) works:

```
sage: NumberField([x^2 + 79*x-60, x^2 - 69*x + 38], 'a')

  ***   Warning: insufficient precision for fundamental units, not given.
Number Field in a0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 79*x - 60 over its base field
```

Basically there is something very wrong with how we make relative fields... probably because of something very very wrong in the core of pari itself (and it's relative number fields).
