Attachment [trac_4028.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4028/trac_4028.patch) by mabshoff created at 2008-09-01 03:17:10

One spelling error: "requires Axoim" (which Mike corrected) - other than that is passes doctests with and without Axiom installed. Mike went with me over the patch and answered questions. Positive review.

Cheers,

Michael

Oops, with the original axiom running the doctest with -optional results in a fork bomb :(

Looks like somehow the following ends up getting called:

```
sage -axiom -nox -noclef
```
If I run that from the command line it also starts a fork bomb.

Thoughts?

It is all William's fault:

```
mabshoff@sage:/usr/local/bin$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
mabshoff@sage:/usr/local/bin$ cat axiom 
#!/bin/sh
sage -axiom $*
```
