One spelling error: "requires Axoim" (which Mike corrected) - other than that is passes doctests with and without Axiom installed. Mike went with me over the patch and answered questions. Positive review.

Cheers,

Oops, with the original axiom running the doctest with -optional results in a fork bomb :(

Looks like somehow the following ends up getting called:

```
sage -axiom -nox -noclef
```
If I run that from the command line it also starts a fork bomb.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

It is all William's fault:

```
mabshoff@sage:/usr/local/bin$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
mabshoff@sage:/usr/local/bin$ cat axiom 
#!/bin/sh
sage -axiom $*
```

Cheers,

Michael
