This bundle does several things:

1. Massively speed up `prime_range`. Before:

    ```
    sage: time ls = prime_range(10^8)
    CPU times: user 143.74 s, sys: 1.51 s, total: 145.26 s
    Wall time: 145.93 s
   ```

 After:
    

    ```
    sage: %time ls = prime_range(10^8)
    CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 1.08 s, total: 2.84 s
    Wall time: 2.87 s
    ```

 This was first mentioned during the `3.1.3.alpha0` testing cycle. 

2. Speed up `gcd` and `lcm`. These were rewritten to be much more robust as part of #3118. However, these were accidentally made much slower. This patch fixes that. 

 Before #3118:

    ```
    sage: n = 928374923
    sage: m = 892734
    sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
    100000 loops, best of 3: 6.13 Âµs per loop
    ```
    
 After #3118:

    ```
    sage: n = 928374923
    sage: m = 892734
    sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
    10000 loops, best of 3: 25.7 Âµs per loop
    ```   
   
 With this patch:

    ```
    sage: n = 928374923
    sage: m = 892734
    sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
    100000 loops, best of 3: 3.97 Âµs per loop
    ```

 I also tested on lots of other kinds of input (lists of `Integer`s, list of `int`s, list of `long`s, etc), and the code **seems** to be always at least as fast as both before and after the patch at #3118. If there are cases I've missed, please let me know! 
   
3. Tidy up `sage/rings/arith.py`. This was mostly small cosmetic changes; it would be a good project to go through this file, remove more cruft, and move some functions to Cython. If someone wants to make a ticket and assign it to me, I'll try to get to it at some point.

4. Clean up and reorganize all of the files with `arith` in their name. In particular, I moved `sage/ext/arith.pyx` to `sage/rings/fast_arith.pyx`, and removed all of the legacy `arith_c`, `arith_gmp`, etc. Most of these were empty files that dated back to the days when Pyrex wouldn't let us keep `.pyx` files in multiple directories. There were also two files which seemed to be a Pyrex implementation of polynomials mod n, I believe by Didier Deshommes. These aren't used anywhere in Sage, and we have new code that does that (based on David Harvey's `znpoly`), so I've removed them.

I have tested all of `sage/rings/`, but one should really do a `sage -br` and a `sage -testall` before giving this bundle a positive review. I'll try to do this soon, but I wanted to get the patch posted while I was at it.

Since several files were added and removed from the mercurial archive, I'm attaching a bundle instead of a patch. I'm adding John Cremona and Paul Zimmerman to the `cc`, because they're most qualified to look at the changes I made after #3118 and see if I accidentally un-did any of their work on some corner cases.

What am I supposed to do with those .hg files?  For the first one I get an error message when I click on it; for the second it just displays a whole lot of changelogs.  Right-clicking and asking to save just ends up with some html in a file.  Perhaps the .patch patch file contains everything?

Awaiting instructions....

Well, even though it doesn't show the changesets when you click, here's what theoretically should happen:

* click on `trac-4443.hg`
* click on "Original Format" and save the file
* in a new `3.2.alpha2` branch, type `hg unbundle trac-4443.hg`

You should then be good to go.

There only seems to be one relevant changeset in there, i.e.

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/4443/trac-4443-huge.hg?changeset=10886

Then why not post a patch and then delete the other crap from the ticket? There is also trac-4443.patch which seems to be that one changeset?

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

First things first:  patch applies cleanly to 3.2.alpha2, but -testall gives this:

```
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py

	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/cuspidal_submodule.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/element.py
```
which are probably all trivial but need to be fixed.

I find a patch like this quite hard to review, since it combines a lot of moving of chunks of code around (certainly a good idea here) with all the trivial changes which that leads to;  and some real bug-fixes.  When scanning the patch one sees lots of large blue and red hunks (which may or may not hide significant code changes), and a lot of trivial changes, and buried in there is the "real meat".

One thing I could not work out easily was exactly how my earlier changes to lcm and gcd caused the slow-down!

Anyway this is a basically positive review, and I'll be happy to look at it again.

So the `calculus.py` failure above is a numerical noise issue, which (I hope!) is independent -- it seems to be #4436. 

Everything else comes from one single error: 

```
sage: pari(0).primepi()
BOOM!
```

I've fixed this, and all the above doctests pass.

Hi John,

Actually, there were a few things that slowed it down. If you look at the case of `gcd(a,b)`, where `a` and `b` are of type `Integer`, then what we really need to do is call `a.gcd(b)` and return that result. 

In the current version, with these inputs, we:
* check that `b is not None`
* check `hasattr(a,"gcd")`
* return `a.gcd(b)`

In the previous version, we:
* do an import: `from sage.structure.sequence import Sequence`
* create `Sequence((a,b))`
* call `__GCD_sequence`
* call `g = ZZ(0)`
* call `g = g.gcd(a)`
* call `g = g.gcd(b)`

So there are definitely just more steps going on. The two most expensive are the first two, as I recall. I think that just the import and the creation of the Sequence were roughly 2/3 of the time spent in `gcd(a,b)`! You can always check this by setting `a` and `b` and doing `%timeit` from the command line.

One more note: after the patch, it would actually be **faster** to do a `try`/`except` instead of the `hasattr` in the case of two `Integer`s, by a constant factor that's roughly 10% for tiny integers. However, it costs us a factor of 2-3 in the case of Python `int` or `long` -- and since these classes don't have a `gcd` method, I think this is where the code gets used most.
