This bundle does several things:

1. Massively speed up `prime_range`. Before:

    ```
sage: time ls = prime_range(10^8)
CPU times: user 143.74 s, sys: 1.51 s, total: 145.26 s
Wall time: 145.93 s
   ```

 After:
    
    ```
sage: %time ls = prime_range(10^8)
CPU times: user 1.76 s, sys: 1.08 s, total: 2.84 s
Wall time: 2.87 s
    ```

 This was first mentioned during the `3.1.3.alpha0` testing cycle. 

2. Speed up `gcd` and `lcm`. These were rewritten to be much more robust as part of #3118. However, these were accidentally made much slower. This patch fixes that. 

 Before #3118:

    ```
sage: n = 928374923
sage: m = 892734
sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.13 Âµs per loop
    ```
    
 After #3118:

    ```
sage: n = 928374923
sage: m = 892734
sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
10000 loops, best of 3: 25.7 Âµs per loop
    ```   
   
 With this patch:

    ```
sage: n = 928374923
sage: m = 892734
sage: %timeit gcd(n,m)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.97 Âµs per loop
    ```

 I also tested on lots of other kinds of input (lists of `Integer`s, list of `int`s, list of `long`s, etc), and the code **seems** to be always at least as fast as both before and after the patch at #3118. If there are cases I've missed, please let me know! 
   
3. Tidy up `sage/rings/arith.py`. This was mostly small cosmetic changes; it would be a good project to go through this file, remove more cruft, and move some functions to Cython. If someone wants to make a ticket and assign it to me, I'll try to get to it at some point.

4. Clean up and reorganize all of the files with `arith` in their name. In particular, I moved `sage/ext/arith.pyx` to `sage/rings/fast_arith.pyx`, and removed all of the legacy `arith_c`, `arith_gmp`, etc. Most of these were empty files that dated back to the days when Pyrex wouldn't let us keep `.pyx` files in multiple directories. There were also two files which seemed to be a Pyrex implementation of polynomials mod n, I believe by Didier Deshommes. These aren't used anywhere in Sage, and we have new code that does that (based on David Harvey's `znpoly`), so I've removed them.

I have tested all of `sage/rings/`, but one should really do a `sage -br` and a `sage -testall` before giving this bundle a positive review. I'll try to do this soon, but I wanted to get the patch posted while I was at it.

Since several files were added and removed from the mercurial archive, I'm attaching a bundle instead of a patch. I'm adding John Cremona and Paul Zimmerman to the `cc`, because they're most qualified to look at the changes I made after #3118 and see if I accidentally un-did any of their work on some corner cases.

What am I supposed to do with those .hg files?  For the first one I get an error message when I click on it; for the second it just displays a whole lot of changelogs.  Right-clicking and asking to save just ends up with some html in a file.  Perhaps the .patch patch file contains everything?

Awaiting instructions....

Well, even though it doesn't show the changesets when you click, here's what theoretically should happen:

* click on `trac-4443.hg`
* click on "Original Format" and save the file
* in a new `3.2.alpha2` branch, type `hg unbundle trac-4443.hg`

You should then be good to go.

There only seems to be one relevant changeset in there, i.e.

http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/4443/trac-4443-huge.hg?changeset=10886

Then why not post a patch and then delete the other crap from the ticket? There is also trac-4443.patch which seems to be that one changeset?

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

First things first:  patch applies cleanly to 3.2.alpha2, but -testall gives this:

```
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/calculus/calculus.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_modform.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/tests/book_stein_ent.py

	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/cuspidal_submodule.py
	sage -t  devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/element.py
```
which are probably all trivial but need to be fixed.

I find a patch like this quite hard to review, since it combines a lot of moving of chunks of code around (certainly a good idea here) with all the trivial changes which that leads to;  and some real bug-fixes.  When scanning the patch one sees lots of large blue and red hunks (which may or may not hide significant code changes), and a lot of trivial changes, and buried in there is the "real meat".

One thing I could not work out easily was exactly how my earlier changes to lcm and gcd caused the slow-down!

Anyway this is a basically positive review, and I'll be happy to look at it again.

So the `calculus.py` failure above is a numerical noise issue, which (I hope!) is independent -- it seems to be #4436. 

Everything else comes from one single error: 

```
sage: pari(0).primepi()
BOOM!
```

I've fixed this, and all the above doctests pass.

With the second patch applied on top of the first all the doctests which failed before (apart from the irrelevant calculus.py one) now pass. +1!

Hi John,

Actually, there were a few things that slowed it down. If you look at the case of `gcd(a,b)`, where `a` and `b` are of type `Integer`, then what we really need to do is call `a.gcd(b)` and return that result. 

In the current version, with these inputs, we:
* check that `b is not None`
* check `hasattr(a,"gcd")`
* return `a.gcd(b)`

In the previous version, we:
* do an import: `from sage.structure.sequence import Sequence`
* create `Sequence((a,b))`
* call `__GCD_sequence`
* call `g = ZZ(0)`
* call `g = g.gcd(a)`
* call `g = g.gcd(b)`

So there are definitely just more steps going on. The two most expensive are the first two, as I recall. I think that just the import and the creation of the Sequence were roughly 2/3 of the time spent in `gcd(a,b)`! You can always check this by setting `a` and `b` and doing `%timeit` from the command line.

One more note: after the patch, it would actually be **faster** to do a `try`/`except` instead of the `hasattr` in the case of two `Integer`s, by a constant factor that's roughly 10% for tiny integers. However, it costs us a factor of 2-3 in the case of Python `int` or `long` -- and since these classes don't have a `gcd` method, I think this is where the code gets used most.

I am pretty sure this is caused by #4452 which I just merged on top of 3.2.alpha3.

This should work. Apply

```
trac-4443-rebase.patch
trac-4443-pt2.patch
trac-4443-pt3.patch
```

in that order.
