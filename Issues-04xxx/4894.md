I have recently been using save_session a bit, and I uncovered what I
believe is a bug. If the worksheet of the session that I'm trying to
save contains a cython function, then load_session chokes. For
example:

var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = srange(1,10000)
var4 = range(1,3000)
var5 = 1234.123456

%cython
def test(double x):
   return x

save_session('test_session')

and then I save and exit, and re-enter the worksheet

load_session('test_session')

and I get

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

When I ran save_session with verbose = true, I noticed that it saved
test, which according to the docstring shouldn't have happened. Does
anyone have any workarounds for this issue?

The attached patch fixes the problem by explicitly not saving builtin (or not)) functions or classes, since in fact defining classes also breaks load_session and save_session.

It just occurred to me that one can still make sessions that can't be reloaded.  E.g.,

```
class Foo:
    pass

f = Foo()
```

Then save_session followed by quit and load_session fails.  However, I doubt there is any good way to deal with this.  Fortunately, in the above case, unlike in the case that this bug is about, one can simply re-evaluate the code to define Foo, and suddenly load_session works fine. 
I've put a comment abou this in the patch.
