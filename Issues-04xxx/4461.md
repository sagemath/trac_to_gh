No package for fricas release 1.0.4 was ever completed. Meanwhile there is a new version of FriCAS available.

An experimental package for fricas release 1.0.5 is available here:

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/page/packages/fricas-1.0.5.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/page/packages/fricas-1.0.5.spkg)

So far I have only tested this package with sage-3.1.2 on sage.math using the following commands:

```
  $ wget http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/page/packages/fricas-1.0.5.spkg
  $ .../sage -f fricas-1.0.5.spkg
```

For example with this version you can compute the following integral:

```
sage: ex1=axiom(2^x/sqrt(1+4^x));ex1

       x
      2
  ---------
   +------+
   | x
  \|4  + 1
sage: ex1.integrate(x)

         +-----------------+
         |   x log(2) 2          x log(2)
    log(\|(%e        )  + 1  - %e        )
  - --------------------------------------
                    log(2)

```


Help testing on other platforms and versions of Sage would be appreciated.

Hi Bill, 

I made a patch at #5111 which separates the FriCAS and the Axiom interfaces.  Most of the functionality is still in axiom.py since it is common to both.  Also, the improvements at #4036 are in that patch.

Could you make it so that the spkg does not install an executable named 'axiom'?  Then, we can put that spkg up when that patch goes in.

Thanks,
