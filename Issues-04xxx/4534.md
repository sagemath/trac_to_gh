Good point. I know I timed it when I wrote it (though I obviously didn't look at the output carefully) -- of course, since the broken version doesn't do much work, it's faster. Correcting it slows it way down. 

Patch coming right up.

New patch, which should be much better. Unfortunately, it touches `integer.pxd`, so it takes a while to rebuild.

Applied trac-4534-v2.patch

Run ./sage -b and did a make check

All tests passed except the known issue with combinat/species/library.py

So I give this ticket a positive review.
