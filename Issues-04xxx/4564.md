So the code here looks good. I even pulled out my old G4 and tested it on a big-endian machine, and everything worked fine.

I do have one question, though: doesn't the `mpz_set_longlong` belong somewhere more generic than `integer.pyx`? I would have put it somewhere in libcsage. Of course, then it wouldn't be so easy to raise the exception ...
