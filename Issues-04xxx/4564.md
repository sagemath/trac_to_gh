So the code here looks good. I even pulled out my old G4 and tested it on a big-endian machine, and everything worked fine.

I do have one question, though: doesn't the `mpz_set_longlong` belong somewhere more generic than `integer.pyx`? I would have put it somewhere in libcsage. Of course, then it wouldn't be so easy to raise the exception ...

Yeah, probably does belong in libcsage... I'm going to be moving stuff around when I split up cdefs anyways. I was just concentrating more on divisors at that point ;).

I guess this is caused by an extra "sage: " in that line. I am editing the patch to fix this.
