The patch improves the doctest coverage of ell_point.py to 100%. However, a test is failing, with _magma_init_(), and I wasn't able to fix it, it seems the _magma_().name() implementation is buggy:

```
File "/usr/local/sage-3.1.2/sage/tmp/ell_point.py", line 1289:
    sage: P._magma_init_()
Expected:
    'EllipticCurve([GF(17)!1,GF(17)!16])![13,4]'
Got:
    '_sage_[2]![_sage_[3],_sage_[4]]'
```
Also, I believe ell_padic.py should be removed, since it is said it is deprecated, and it does
not seem to be used anywhere.

I guess Robert wanted to say that the _magma_init_ error
is now a separate ticket, namely #4288.

It was someone else ;)

Someone who looked at this one earlier might like to to try it out along with my patch to #4288 since I think the two together work fine (this one needs to be applied before that one).
