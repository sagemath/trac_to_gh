Before

```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 625 Âµs per loop
```

After

```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 530 ns per loop
```

This is at least close to 

```
sage: timeit("1 is None")
625 loops, best of 3: 330 ns per loop
```

but people who don't know about the `is` operator shouldn't be hit that bad...

I think the doctest should change, I believe the purpose is to show that things don't go boom when you compare with None, not that an ordering is enforced.
