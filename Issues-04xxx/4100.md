This is because the coercion model is invoked, and with types it actually tries to cast one direction or the other, raising errors. 

Component: **basic arithmetic**

Before

```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 625 Âµs per loop
```

After

```
sage: timeit("1 == None")
625 loops, best of 3: 530 ns per loop
```

This is at least close to 

```
sage: timeit("1 is None")
625 loops, best of 3: 330 ns per loop
```

but people who don't know about the `is` operator shouldn't be hit that bad...
