In the file sage/rings/integer.pyx, line 288 says 

```
    cdef class Integer (sage.structure.element.EuclideanDomainElement): 
```
followed by documentation and the various methods for this class.  But earlier in the file, line 137 says 

```
    cdef class Integer(sage.structure.element.EuclideanDomainElement) 
```
The attached patch removes line 137.
