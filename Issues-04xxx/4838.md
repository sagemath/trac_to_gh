It would be nice to be able to do:

```
sage: CC(3-2*I).plot()
```

which would return a plot object of the point 3-2*I.  I guess it just needs to wrap the normal plot of a point.

This works (so patch does its job as designed)

```
CC(1+I).plot() 
```

This currently doesnt work (because not part of this ticket) 

```
[CC(cos(theta)+I*sin(theta)) for theta in srange(0, 2*pi, pi/4)].plot()
```
(its a natural extension of the idea in this ticket, but will have to be a new ticket if anyone thinks its worth implementing)

BEWARE: It's not a good idea to implement this (and not even possible). To be able to do this the .plot() method have to be coded inside the list object which is a python object.

But remains the question on how do the following work ?

```
sage: z0 = CC(2,3)
sage: plot(z0)   # works with this patch
sage: z1 = 2 + 3*I
sage: plot(z1)  # does not work because z1 is in SR and not in CC
```

Most of the time users have to think about using `point` more than `plot` for complex numbers... and I'm not sure about the usefulness of this ticket...
