RuntimeError: Computation of complementary space failed (cut down to rank 18, but should have cut down to rank 1).
```

Note that the error is wrong, as 

```
sage: ModularSymbols(128, sign=1)

Modular Symbols space of dimension 18 for Gamma_0(128) of weight 2 with sign 1 over Rational Field
```

however, it should have cut the rank down to 17.

This seems to be the same error as #1127 ...

I'm curious whether my (still unfinished) patch from #2535 might help. I don't know that I ever checked ...

You're right, it is exactly #1127. I searched before making a ticket, but I guess I didn't go far enough back in time. Hopefully you've already fixed it :). 

I'm closing this as a dupe.
