Points on elliptic curves over Q which are not [0:1:0] have their last coordinate =1 but sometimes this is an int (not even an Integer) which breaks some code:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: [type(c) for c in E(0)]

[<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>]
sage: [type(c) for c in E.gen(0)]

[<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>]
sage: [type(c) for c in 2*E.gen(0)]

[<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>,
 <type 'int'>]
```
I am tracking this down and will post a patch soon.

Looks fine by me.  I checked that (0 : 1 : 0) over a non-standard ring had the correct types.
