A possible solution would be to put this file in another location, and adapt "sage -sdist" so that it is copied to the intended place.

Then we would need another "README.txt" for binary distributions explaining the empty spkg's (which puzzled my quite a bit when I was Sage newbie), also put in "another location", and copied by "sage -bdist" to the very same place.

I don't think this is a ticket to prevent 3.2 from going out, so I bump the Milestone up.

I'm not at all familiar with binary distros of Sage, since I've never got hold of a copy of a binary release. So in that sense, I'm not exactly sure how to go about writing the README.txt that you suggest. But from your comment, I guess that such a README.txt for a binary distro would include the same (or similar) text as contained in the above patch.

>But from your comment, I guess that such a README.txt for a binary distro would include the same (or similar) text as contained in the above patch. 

Not really --- in a binary distro, the files "sage_scripts-3.2.spgk" and so on all exist, but they are all empty files. The "spkg/standard" directory then looks pretty much the same as the "spkg/installed" directory, there is no real data contained in it except for the list of names of empty files. Which is confusing and deserves some kind of explanatory "README.txt", which would have to explain this.

Hi,

Right now in a fresh install of sage-3.2.2.alpha0, there is a README.txt file in spkg/standard/.  It is simply an OLD out-of-date version of the README.txt file in SAGE_ROOT.  I think it should be completely deleted.  Then a file README.txt in the spkg directory should be created with two short sections, and those sections should contain the text mvngu wrote.  That's it.

I'm not convinced about having all the extra infrastructure for two separate readme's for the source and binary versions of Sage.  Even if that is a good idea, it could be a separate ticket, since as is, this ticket would not be in "with patch; needs review" status if that extra stuff has to be done. 

So in short, I suggest doing the following:
1. (see attached patch trac_4504_scripts.patch) Add the line

```
cp -p $PKGDIR/README.txt $TMP/$PKGDIR/
```
as line 64 of local/bin/sage-sdist. The analogue of this is currently already done in sage-bdist (line 90).  

2. Delete spkg/standard/README.txt

3. Make a new spkg/README.txt file that has two sections, one for each of Minh's patches. 

By the way, it's been suggested above that the spkg/standard/*.spkg files are empty in a bdist.  They aren't empty. They contain the single sentence: "Placeholder spkg file so this binary version of Sage knows this package version used when installing Sage."


Also, I have issues with the actual wording of mvngu's patch, which is:

```
4 	If you've downloaded a binary distribution of Sage, you'd likely see
5 	a number of files with the extension ".spkg" under the directory
6 	SAGE_ROOT/spkg. In a binary distribution of Sage, such files are empty
7 	files and you don't need to do anything about them. Just ignore such
8 	files for the moment.
9 	
10 	However, note that in a source distribution of Sage, .spkg files under
11 	SAGE_ROOT/spkg are core Sage packages, which extend Sage's
12 	functionalities.
```

First, there are no spkg files in SAGE_ROOT/spkg; they are in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/.
Second, it's not "likely" -- they will always be there with probability 1.
Third, they aren't empty, as mentioned above. 
Fourth, in the case of source they don't "extend Sage's functionalities", they *are* the source code that defines Sage.    So I would replace all the above with:

```
The directories SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard and SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional contain spkg's.  
In a source install, these are all Sage spkg files (actually .tar or .tar.bz2 files), which are the source code that defines Sage.  In a binary install some of these may be small placeholder files to save space.
```

Hi Michael,

this can go as-is into 3.3. There are three things to do:

A) Delete the "README.txt" file (no repo) under $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/

B) Copy the "trac_4504-draft2.txt" as "README.txt" file under $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/
   (this is intentionally one directory "above" where the old file was)

C) Apply the patch "trac_4504_scripts_sdist.patch" from William to /local/bin

Tested with 3.3.rc0.

Cheers, gsw
