A possible solution would be to put this file in another location, and adapt "sage -sdist" so that it is copied to the intended place.

Then we would need another "README.txt" for binary distributions explaining the empty spkg's (which puzzled my quite a bit when I was Sage newbie), also put in "another location", and copied by "sage -bdist" to the very same place.

I don't think this is a ticket to prevent 3.2 from going out, so I bump the Milestone up.

I'm not at all familiar with binary distros of Sage, since I've never got hold of a copy of a binary release.

Attachment [trac_4504-spkg-bin.tex](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4504/trac_4504-spkg-bin.tex) by mvngu created at 2008-12-06 02:08:59

The files **trac_4504-spkg-src.tex** and **trac_4504-spkg-bin.tex** are readme files that briefly explain Sage's .spkg extensions. Due to some stupidity on my part, I named them with the ".tex" extension and forgot to change the ".tex" to ".txt". Sorry folks.



The file **trac_4504-spkg-src.tex** gives some brief explanation about files with the .spkg extension as part of their name. That is, **trac_4504-spkg-src.tex** is a replacement for **trac_4504.patch**, so we can ignore **trac_4504.patch**. For source distributions of Sage, **trac_4504-spkg-src.tex** should be renamed to "README.txt" and placed under the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` or somewhere under that directory tree.



The file **trac_4504-spkg-bin.tex** gives some brief explanation about the empty .spkg files found in binary distributions of Sage. For binary distributions of Sage, **trac_4504-spkg-bin.tex** should be renamed to "README.txt" and placed under the directory `SAGE_ROOT/spkg` or somewhere under that directory tree.

Hi,

Right now in a fresh install of sage-3.2.2.alpha0, there is a README.txt file in spkg/standard/.  It is simply an OLD out-of-date version of the README.txt file in SAGE_ROOT.  I think it should be completely deleted.  Then a file README.txt in the spkg directory should be created with two short sections, and those sections should contain the text mvngu wrote.  That's it.

I'm not convinced about having all the extra infrastructure for two separate readme's for the source and binary versions of Sage.  Even if that is a good idea, it could be a separate ticket, since as is, this ticket would not be in "with patch; needs review" status if that extra stuff has to be done. 

So in short, I suggest doing the following:
1. (see attached patch trac_4504_scripts.patch) Add the line

```
cp -p $PKGDIR/README.txt $TMP/$PKGDIR/
```
as line 64 of local/bin/sage-sdist. The analogue of this is currently already done in sage-bdist (line 90).  

2. Delete spkg/standard/README.txt

3. Make a new spkg/README.txt file that has two sections, one for each of Minh's patches. 

By the way, it's been suggested above that the spkg/standard/*.spkg files are empty in a bdist.  They aren't empty. They contain the single sentence: "Placeholder spkg file so this binary version of Sage knows this package version used when installing Sage."


Also, I have issues with the actual wording of mvngu's patch, which is:

```
4 	If you've downloaded a binary distribution of Sage, you'd likely see
5 	a number of files with the extension ".spkg" under the directory
6 	SAGE_ROOT/spkg. In a binary distribution of Sage, such files are empty
7 	files and you don't need to do anything about them. Just ignore such
8 	files for the moment.
9 	
10 	However, note that in a source distribution of Sage, .spkg files under
11 	SAGE_ROOT/spkg are core Sage packages, which extend Sage's
12 	functionalities.
```

First, there are no spkg files in SAGE_ROOT/spkg; they are in SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/.
Second, it's not "likely" -- they will always be there with probability 1.
Third, they aren't empty, as mentioned above. 
Fourth, in the case of source they don't "extend Sage's functionalities", they *are* the source code that defines Sage.    So I would replace all the above with:

```
The directories SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard and SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional contain spkg's.  
In a source install, these are all Sage spkg files (actually .tar or .tar.bz2 files), which are the source code that defines Sage.  In a binary install some of these may be small placeholder files to save space.
```

Hi Michael,

this can go as-is into 3.3. There are three things to do:

A) Delete the "README.txt" file (no repo) under $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/

B) Copy the "trac_4504-draft2.txt" as "README.txt" file under $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/
   (this is intentionally one directory "above" where the old file was)

C) Apply the patch "trac_4504_scripts_sdist.patch" from William to /local/bin

Tested with 3.3.rc0.

Cheers, gsw

Replying to [GeorgSWeber](#comment%3A21):
> Understandable. Given that we do not need a rebase for 3.4.1, and the "minor" priority of this ticket, a wise decision. Good luck for 3.3!


Well, there will be non-trivial work done on -sdist and -bdist in 3.4, so this time might also go in. We will see.
