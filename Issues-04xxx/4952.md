I am no longer seeing this with the system compiler in 3.3.alpha6, but will try with gcc 4.3.3.

The issue has been fixed (or at least no longer happens) with Sage 3.3.alpha6 with the system gcc as well as gcc 4.3.3:

```
mabshoff@menas:~/build-3.3.alpha6/sage-3.3.alpha6-menas-gcc433> ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.pyx
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/rings/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.pyx"
	 [5.2 s]
```
