Attachment: **[trac_4714-minimal_doc.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4714/trac_4714-minimal_doc.patch.gz)**

This [p(r)oof of concept](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4714/trac_4714-minimal_doc.patch.gz), which depends on a [patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4714/95d9ff05421900c5add23d0432b4c00a.gz) at #6614,

* Adds `doc/common/static/jsmath_sage.js`.
* Sets `jsmath_path=jsmath_sage.js` in `doc/common/conf.py`.

The new static file is jsMath's "stock" `easy/load.js` plus all Sage-related customizations I could find, including extensions, macros, and a few other bits from `notebook.py`.  I've also made changes below `DO NOT MAKE CHANGES BELOW THIS` (gasp!) to help the loader find jsMath from its new [relative] location.

I think this means we don't need to patch the spkg.  Later, we may be able to use Sphinx 0.6.2's static templates to insert an updated macro list at build time (cf. #6586).

Perhaps we can do something similar for the notebook, e.g., in `sage/server/notebook/templates`.
