We decided to temporarily disable the caching of the cython dependencies during the build, simply because it was causing so much grief. However, this should be re-enabled once someone takes the time to sit down and work out the last kinks. In particular, **removing** files from the sage tree and rebuilding tends to cause exceptions.

See `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/setup.py` for some comments, and to play with this.
