It is *always* safe to delete anything in ~/.sage/gap, since it will get autorecreated when Sage is started.   I just looked at my ~/.sage/gap on sage.math and it is HUGE:

```
wstein@sage:~/.sage/gap$ ls -1 |wc -l
90
wstein@sage:~/.sage/gap$ du -sch .
1.3G .
1.3G total
```

I have stuff in there going back to March 2008.

The code in gap.py that creates the workspace in .sage/gap should also delete all old workspaces.   I think 1 week is arbitrary, but is safe since as mentioned above any time length is safe. 

Component: **performance**

I know there are GAP users who always load GAP via a workspace. I'm worried that if the only way to use GAP in Sage was to use a "recent" workspace then these users would not be well-werved.

A possible workaround would be if there was a way to optionally use a specific workspace. In other words, .\sage -gap and gap_console() could take an optional argument with a specific workspace. Does this seem reasonable? It might be rarely used, but it could be a potentially very useful feature to allow users to use another workspace.

This criticism of my suggestion doesn't make sense, because I'm *only* suggesting deleting the old workspaces in ~/.sage/gap/.  Not all workspaces on the users computer or something.      Anyway, I think your worry about makes no sense (to me). Please correct me if I'm wrong (quite possible).  Thanks.

To test the attached patch, look $HOME/.sage/gap, and notice if you have a lot of old files there.  Maybe even fake some old workspace files like this:

```
touch -t 01010000 workspace-00
```

Then touch local/bin/gap_stamp to force a recheck

```
cd SAGE_ROOT
touch local/bin/gap_stamp
```

and note that when you start sage the files you created in $DOT_SAGE/gap are deleted.
