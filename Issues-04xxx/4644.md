We used to have:

```
[jaap@paix sage-3.1.1]$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

Sage subshell$ exit
exit
Exited Sage subshell.
[jaap@paix sage-3.1.1]$ 

```

But in sage-3.2:

```
[jaap@paix sage-3.2]$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

[jaap@paix sage-3.2]$ 

```

I've been bitten by this once more!

Jaap

Hi Jaap, 

this one should have gone to [sage-devel] since we need to find out what the bug is. Anmd having a discussion on the ticket sucks. But:

* are you using bash as default login shell?
* please post the output from sage-sage after changing "#!/usr/bin/env bash" to "#!/usr/bin/env bash -x"

Cheers,

Ok, sorry. We had a discussion long time ago. You said you were bitten by this many times!

Due to #4512 mhansen:
Could we at least have a PS1 that includes the current directory? I always hated it when I was on a machine where "sage -sh" didn't use my existing PS1.


We now have the trouble of finding out which shell we use!

```
Exited Sage subshell.

This is https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/4644
I opened 6 month ago.

We have to thank Mike Hansen and Craig Citro for this :)
