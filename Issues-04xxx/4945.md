I can confirm this bug. It is caused by the generic latex method for Expect elements: 
 

``` 
sage: latex(gp(2+2)) 
\begin{verbatim}4\end{verbatim} 
``` 
 
which apparently doesn't play well with jsMath. 
 
`search_src("begin{verbatim}")` returns 43 hits.

Most of those are in docstrings, so we don't need to worry about them.  I think the only relevant instances are interfaces/expect.py, misc/latex.py, misc/log.py.  I don't understand how verbatim is used in the last two.  The attached patch seems to fix the problem in the first one: `latex(gp(2+2))` works in the notebook now.

(The solution here is to change verbatim to verb -- search misc/all.py for 'verbatim' to see very similar code) and then to use the jsMath 'verb' extension.)

The extra \require{verb} worries me, since it is included each time an element is LaTeXified. Shouldn't it be in some header?

Cheers,

Yes, maybe it should.  I couldn't figure out where, though.

I just posted a slightly different version of the patch.  It doesn't address malb's issue, but it is a little cleaner: it only includes '\require{verb}' if in notebook mode.
