When using the SAGE notebook with typeset on, the command 

``` 
  gp(2+2) 
``` 
gives the error `'Unknown environment "verbatim"'`. 
 
Typing 

``` 
  gp(2+2) 
``` 
in the SAGE command line works fine. I think it is a latex output 
error. 
 
I can confirm this bug. It is caused by the generic latex method for Expect elements: 
 

``` 
sage: latex(gp(2+2)) 
\begin{verbatim}4\end{verbatim} 
``` 
 
which apparently doesn't play well with jsMath. 
 
`search_src("begin{verbatim}")` returns 43 hits.

The extra \require{verb} worries me, since it is included each time an element is LaTeXified. Shouldn't it be in some header?

Yes, maybe it should.  I couldn't figure out where, though.
