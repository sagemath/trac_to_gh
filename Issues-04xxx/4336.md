I attached a pyx-file:

```
sage: attach f5.pyx
Compiling /home/king/Projekte/f5/f5.pyx...
```

Then I changed the file on the disk, and pressed the `Enter` key in Sage. This should result in a recompilation of `f5.pyx`, but instead I got this traceback:

```
sage:
Compiling /home/king/Projekte/f5/f5.pyx...

    395             L = B[i]

    193                         __IPYTHON__.push(X)
    194                     else:

    341     try:
--> 342         mod, dir  = cython.cython(name, compile_message=True, use_cache=True)
    343     except (IOError, OSError, RuntimeError), msg:
    344         print "Error compiling cython file:\n%s"%msg

    311                                         for fname in additional_source_files])
    312
--> 313     pyx = '%s/%s.pyx'%(build_dir, name)
    314     open(pyx,'w').write(F)
    315     setup="""

UnboundLocalError: local variable 'name' referenced before assignment
```

Afterwards, leaving Sage was impossible using `quit` -- I got the same traceback again and had to quit with `Ctrl-D`.

I think the problem is in lines 299-311 of `cython.py`, which is

```
    if create_local_so_file:
        name = base
    else:
        global sequence_number
        if not sequence_number.has_key(base):
            sequence_number[base] = 0
            name = '%s_%s'%(base, sequence_number[base])

            # increment the sequence number so will use a different one next time.
            sequence_number[base] += 1

    additional_source_files = ",".join(["'"+os.path.abspath(os.curdir)+"/"+fname+"'" \
                                        for fname in additional_source_files])
```

If I'm not mistaken, there is a wrong indentation, and it should be

```
    if create_local_so_file:
        name = base
    else:
        global sequence_number
        if not sequence_number.has_key(base):
            sequence_number[base] = 0
        name = '%s_%s'%(base, sequence_number[base])

        # increment the sequence number so will use a different one next time.
        sequence_number[base] += 1

    additional_source_files = ",".join(["'"+os.path.abspath(os.curdir)+"/"+fname+"'" \
                                        for fname in additional_source_files])
```

Problem 1: I have no idea how I can force Sage to use the modified `cython.py`, hence I can not test my changes. 

Problem 2: `hg_sage.commit()` did not work, since it claimed that nothing was changed (although `cython.py` did change). So, no patch.

Can you give me a solution to Problems 1 and 2? And does my suggested solution works?
Cheers
      Simon

Dear Michael,

Replying to [mabshoff](#comment%3A1):

I chose local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/misc/cython.py

Which should I take instead?
