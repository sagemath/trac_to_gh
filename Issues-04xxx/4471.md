It would be better, I think, to have the worksheet named when it is created. Right now it is given the name 'untitled' and one needs to click on the title or select 'rename' from the menu. This ends up in a lot of worksheets being left named 'untitled'.

So please change so that the user is given a naming window when creating a new worksheet which can default to 'untitled' if the user doesn't enter a name.

William agrees that this would be a good idea.
