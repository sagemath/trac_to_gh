**Some remarks**

* the patch uses the old style docstring format, cf. http://wiki.sagemath.org/combinat/HelpOnTheDoc 
* you should claim copyright
* `cdef inline int _celement_canonicalise` why not `void`?
* **all** `celement_foo` functions should have doctests, which call the `QQ[x]` methods which call the `celement_` functions
* have you tried switching the default to this implementation to see how many doctests fail?

Hi Martin,

I've now implemented all methods in the prototype.  (I'll attach a new patch in a few minutes.)  All of your above comments make sense and I can go through this tomorrow.  One thing I could not get done is make SAGE use this implementation by default.  In the file polynomial_ring.py, I tried replacing the line 1185 with

    from sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint import Polynomial_rational_dense_flint
    element_class = Polynomial_rational_dense_flint

and while building still works, executing ./sage results in a whole screen full output, ending with

    b37bb0/home/suser/sage-4.1.2.alpha0/local/bin/sage-sage: line 199: 16297 Aborted                 sage-ipython "$`@`" -i

Am I making a mistake in the way I am trying to switch the default, or does this due to problems in the actual new implementation?  I've got no idea how to fix this.  Of course, I am then happy to do lots of testing.

Kind regards,

Sebastian

Thanks for the quick debugging and making the code accessible in SAGE for testing!  I'll upload a new version of the patch later.  Here are a few (unsorted) remarks:

- The printing isn't "nice" yet:  Rationals are still printed in the form r/s even if s divides r.  In fact, all coefficients are printed with the common denominator of the polynomial.  I've got an idea of how to fix that, but I am not sure it'll work;  I'll give it a try later.

- Say we set up to polynomial rings R[x] and S[y], one using the generic implementation and one using FLINT.  Then sometimes (usually?) coercion like "f_flint = S(f_generic)" or "f_generic = R(f_flint)" works, but sometimes it ends in a segfault.  For two random polynomials f and d, of two successive calls "q, s, t = xgcd(f, d)" the first one succeeded and the second one ended in a segfault.  This seems *very* strange to me!

- We achieve a performance gain except in the cases of addition and subtraction.  (See below.)

- The method xgcd doesn't give the right result yet, I'll look into that later.

- I have no idea what you mean by "Note that there is still some conversion code missing in polynomial_rational_flint.pyx."  Are there any examples of this in other files?

You wrote e.g. ` \code{foo} ` which is the old LaTeX style. It should be using the Sphinx markup now.

Actually, I am not quite sure about this.  When working with a random polynomial of degree 2000, which will have lots of non-zero entries all of type fmpz_t, it shouldn't really matter whether we manually initialise a few more for the denominators.

I've tried implementing the denominator with the convention that it is either ``NULL`` (which should be interpreted as one) or initialised to a positive integer.  But this didn't really change the performance.

Another idea, which will sometimes help to keep numbers small, is to instead represented the polynomial over the rationals as ``(num / dem) prim`` where ``num / dem`` is a rational number in reduced form and ``prim`` is a primitive integer polynomial with positive leading coefficient.  Obviously, this change vastly improved the performance of negation (which then only operates on the rational number and leaves the integer polynomial part alone).  But it didn't change much apart from that.  Anyway, given we need to compute the content of the numerator anyway to ensure that it is coprime to the denominator, we might as well store it separately.  I'll implement this throughout the patch and upload a new version later today.

This still leaves the problem:  How can we speed up addition?

At the moment, I don't have any further ideas.  In fact, I think it might perhaps be the case that we simply can't, since in this kind of implementation we have to at least do a few polynomial scalar multiplications (and perhaps polynomial scalar divisions as well as integer gcd computations to maintain the form of the representation) plus all the coefficient additions.  In contrast to this, implementing polynomials as an array of coefficients one only has to do the (rational!) coefficient additions.

So the next things I'll do are

- Change the fmpq_poly_t data type
- Change all the methods accordingly
- Write docstrings

Does anyone have any ideas about the addition?

Did you try the LCM idea? Rationale:

```python
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = P.random_element(3000)
sage: g = P.random_element(3000)
sage: fD = f.denominator()
sage: gD = g.denominator()
sage: (fD*gD).nbits()
320
sage: (fD.lcm(gD)).nbits()
228

Hi Martin,

I am sorry for that.  Last night and this morning I fixed another couple of bugs.  In a few minutes, I'll upload a new patch (or rather, again the difference from the 20090911 patch).  By the way, for debugging purposes all methods in the linkage file now begin with printing the method's name (although in all but the floordiv method, that line begins with '#').

Random (performance!, not correctness...) tests ran fine last night for polynomials of degree 2000 for the methods ==, <, +, -, neg, *, ^.  I thought the three division methods should work fine now, until I stumbled across the following segfault:

    {{{
    sage: S.<y> = QQ[]
    sage: f = -3 * y^10 - 4 * y^9
    sage: g = (1/2) * y^6 + 3 * y^5 + 160930 * y^4
    sage: f // g
    celement_floordiv
    Perform pseudo division -3*x<sup>10-4*x</sup>9 x<sup>6+6*x</sup>5+321860*x^4
    
    
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
    This probably occured because a *compiled* component
    of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
    or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
    You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
    SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    }}}

This strikes me as very odd because the segfault seems to occur in the call ``fmpz_poly_pseudo_div(q.num, &m, a.num, b.num)`` with ``a.num`` the polynomial ``-3*x<sup>10-4*x</sup>9`` and ``b.den`` the polynomial ``x<sup>6+6*x</sup>5+321860*x^4``.  Perhaps you could have a look at this one?

I haven't looked at the two gcd methods yet, but I'll do that later today or tomorrow.

As the last question about the implementation (for this method), I noticed that polynomials over QQ in SAGE have the method ``denominator``, which clearly this implementation should overwrite.  On which level/ in which file should this be done?

Finally, here are the performance timings, in each case for ten random polynomials of degree 2000, first the time for the generic implementation and then the time for this implementation with FLINT:

- ``==`` -  20µs, 1µs
- ``<`` -  20µs, 1µs
- ``+`` -  400µs, 100µs
- ``-`` -  400µs, 100µs
- ``neg`` -  20ms, 20µs
- ``*`` -  500ms, 1ms
- ``^`` (to the 4th power) -  15s, 30µs

Kind regards,

Sebastian

Hi Martin,

I just started to look at the gcd methods again and I also looked at the logic in polynomial_template.pxi.  Here's the question:

Since the gcd of two polynomials is only defined up to multiplication by rationals, what's the *right* way of dealing with this?  I think one can make a good argument for always returning the same normalisation.  This would also mean that we do *not* necessarily have gcd(a,0) == a.  This is currently the way it's handled in the file polynomial_template.pxi.  If we want to normalise the gcd, in which way should this be done?  If it's non-zero..

-  Monic rational polynomial
-  Primitive integer polynomial with positive leading coefficient

Of course, there are lots more but I think these two might be the most sensible choices.

The first one has the advantage that it generalises to all polynomial rings (over commutative rings with 1, at least).  Upon adding a method returning the monic scalar multiple of a polynomial to the template file, one can still handle the cases of gcd(a,0) and gcd(0,b) in the template file.

Personally though, I am more in favour of the second option, since this might lead to faster code when working with QQ[].  In this case, we should remove the handling of the above two cases from the template file and always pass the call on to celement_gcd.  This would mean that we leave the normalisation up to the actual implementation of the polynomial ring, rather than enforcing it across all base rings using the template file.  We would then also have to make sure that all celement_gcd methods are happy to deal with zero arguments.

What do you think?

Sebastian

You would add a method `denominator()` to `Polynomial_rational_dense_flint`.

I think we should have `gcd(a,0) = 1` because this is what `gcd(1/2,0)` returns. I would like to avoid to put this logic in the celement_gcd implementations but if we have to then ... well we have to :)

This might be worth raising on [sage-devel] where people care much more about this than I do, i.e. I guess it is a relevant corner case for number theory and thus people might have strong feelings about it?

I didn't mean the above for rational numbers ``a``, but for rational polynomials ``a``.  Your integer example above highlights that ``gcd`` doesn't necessarily guarantee ``gcd(a, 0) == a``.  The behaviour of ``gcd`` for integers suggests the method should return the monic normalisation.  However, the current logic in ``template_polynomial.pxi`` doesn't do this, for example:

    {{{
    sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(IntegerModRing(3), 't')
    sage: f = 2*t + 1
    sage: type(f)
    <type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
    sage: gcd(f, R(0))
    2*t + 1
    }}}

In the above case, the monic version would be ``t + 2``.

OK, I'll do this.

Almost all of the memory problems are now resolved.

    }}}

The test in ``qqbar.py`` that seems to break down is the following piece of code:

    {{{
    sage: x = polygen(AA)
    sage: r = QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))); r
    sage: r.real().minpoly()
    }}}

The test in ``sage_object.pyx`` that breaks has to do with unpickling, and it's triggered by the following two lines:

    {{{
    sage: std = os.environ['SAGE_DATA'] + '/extcode/pickle_jar/pickle_jar.tar.bz2'
    sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all(std)

I will try to chase down the first problem a little further than the ``minpoly()`` function, perhaps I can resolve it myself.  But any help with the second problem in particular would be very much appreciated.

    cp = AA.common_polynomial(1/2*x^4 - 1/95*x^3 - 1/2*x^2 - 4)
```

but got 

```
    cp = AA.common_polynomial(x^4 - 2/95*x^3 - x^2 - 8)
```

I think that this is okay since they only differ by a multiple of 2 and thus have the exact same roots.

Hello Mike,

Thank you for fixing the unpickling problem!

About the second problem, the one in ``qqbar.py``, are you saying that the following code

    {{{
    sage: x = polygen(AA)
    sage: r = QQbar.polynomial_root(x^5 - x - 1, CIF(RIF(0.1, 0.2), RIF(1.0, 1.1))); r
    sage: r.real().minpoly()
    }}}

now executes without problems on your setup?  On mine, it still crashes with a segmentation fault.  I've uploaded the complete traceback to http://sage.pastebin.com/m5249e09.  I still seems strange to me that the traceback doesn't seem to contain methods that this patch modifies directly.

The other difference you mention is no problem, of course.  That's because I have taken care to ensure that methods returning results that are only defined up to units return monic normalisations.

Many thanks again for taking a look at this patch,

Sebastian

This does not crash for me on 64-bit linux with both FLINT 1.3.0 and FLINT 1.5.0.  You should try the FLINT 1.5.0 spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhansen/flint-1.5.0.spkg.

Firstly, I am sorry for the bad patches I uploaded earlier --- I didn't realise that new files aren't included in a patch by default.  I have changed this now and uploaded a new complete patch ``fmpq_20090925.patch``.

There is one problem with the ``squarefree_decomposition`` method, which for some unknown reason was causing memory failures in the latest version.  For the time being, I've just changed it back to my earlier code, which still uses bad aliasing of arguments to ``fmpz_`` methods.

Mike:  Thanks for taking a look at the composition problem, too.  The failure on my setup must be rather strange, since the traceback also includes ``finance/fractal.so``.  I don't think I understand the ``__call__`` method well enough to do much about it.  In any case, I think the current code (catching polynomial composition, and otherwise passing the call on to ``Polynomial.__call__``) should be preferable.

I am not quite sure what I should do at this point.  I think it would be best to wait until the release of the next stable release of SAGE and then look at this again with the goal to have sorted out as soon as possible.  What do other people think?  If someone has a suggestion for what I should do at the moment, while I might not have too much time during the next few weeks, I should definitely be able to look at this every weekend.

Sebastian

Thanks to Mike for helping to track down the (hopefully) last remaining bug before lunchtime!

I'll go over the code again in the next week or two, adding further documentation and more doctests.  In the meantime, I would be very grateful if other people interested in reviewing it could start looking at the code and provide further comments.

Here is a simpler instance of the problem:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = 3/2*x - 1/3
sage: %time _ = f % f
CPU times: user 5.67 s, sys: 0.17 s, total: 5.84 s

```

I do *not* think that the problem is a coercion problem.  After inserting "print" statements into the Cython code at various points, I instead think the code in the block from line 881 in fmpq_poly_linkage.pxi actually takes this long, although I do not understand at all why this might be the case.

The two lines at actually seem to take time (assuming that inserting "print" statements is a valid way to determine this) are

```
    fmpz_pow_ui(t, lead, m)
    fmpz_mul(r.den, t, a.den)

but, once again, I've got not clue why this might be the case.

Tomorrow or on Tuesday, I will try to reproduce the problem in plain C.  If I manage to do this, I'll forward it to Bill Hart.  If not, I wouldn't really know what else to look into.

I've tried a couple more times and I'm still getting the memory problem followed by crash and core dump.  I'm running 32-bit archlinux on a Dell laptop, with version 4.4.2 of gcc.  It's a clean build of sage-4.3.1 with the patches here.

I also have a macbook running 64-bit archlinux.  It's busy doing other things now, but I can try to test this on it later.

I am sorry for only getting on with this today.  Just now I tried to re-produce the problem in plain C with FLINT, but needless to say, I didn't manage.  A simple-minded reproduction of the relevant code executed in no time and without any problems.  Currently, I am completely out of ideas on how to fix this problem.  That's why I'll raise the issue on sage-devel and conclude this message with a description of the behaviour that I experience on my machine (Lenovo T500 laptop, Intel Core2 Duo CPU, Ubuntu 9.10):

After applying all patches from this ticket to a 4.3.1.rc0 installation, modify the ``else`` block from line 882 in ``sage/libs/flint/fmpq_poly_linkage.pxi`` to the following:

```
            print "In case 3B"
            t = fmpz_init(limbs)
            print "den_fit_limbs"
            __fmpq_poly_den_fit_limbs(r, limbs + fmpz_size(a.den))
            print "pow_ui"
            fmpz_pow_ui(t, lead, m)
            print "mul"
            fmpz_mul(r.den, t, a.den)
            print "clear"
            fmpz_clear(t)
```
This only includes the ``print`` commands.

Then, upon executing the same sequence of commands that produce the crash in Alex' previous message, I receive the following output:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = 3/2*x - 1/3
sage: %time _ = f % f
In case 3B
den_fit_limbs
pow_ui
mul
clear
CPU times: user 19.10 s, sys: 0.54 s, total: 19.64 s
Wall time: 19.72 s
```

What I find very strange (besides the fact that this takes 20s to obtain the correct result) is that there are two very noticeable delays of a couple of seconds, one after the output ``"pow_ui"``, and another after the output of ``"mul"``.

Sebastian

I have just applied your last patch, and I confirm that it gets rid of the nasty doctest failure.

I'd like to test this on some more machines to see if all is well.  And it will most likely have to be rebased, since it touches so many files.  For now I'll keep using 4.3.1, on which it applies fine.

I think the correct fix for the first problem is a change in the docstring, but I am not sure about this.  For the second one, the docstring needs to be changed.  And, finally, for the third one (about the lazy_attribute), I have no idea.

Can someone else please comment on this?

You probably need to implement `lazy_attribute`. I don't know what it is supposed to be doing, so you should ask on [sage-devel].

I just checked that the combined patch applies fine to 4.3.5.  I got just two doctest failures, as in the above report.  Otherwise all pass (64-bit ubuntu).

For parent.pyx: this must be the same thing as in #8332?  You could just delete that doctest, since it tests something on an essentailly random class to which it used to apply but no longer does.

Let's get these last two little things fixed, then this can at last get merged!

On sage.math, qq.patch applies to sage-4.5 and passes all tests except the pickling test:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/misc/explain_pickle.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  -long devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 0 doctests failed
```

And it's damned fast, compared to what is in sage now:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = R.random_element(degree=100)
sage: timeit('f*f')
625 loops, best of 3: 29 µs per loop

Done.

Some minor quibbles:

1. You might want to clean up the commit messages in the patches. Right now they don't include the ticket number, etc. If you're using queues this is `hg qrefresh -e` when the relevant patch is at the top of the applied part of the queue.

2. I'm not sure it's necessary to have things like

```
NOTES: 

    (S Pancratz)  Extracted from polynomial_template.pxi. 
```
since the files are all under revision control, and in fact every line has a list of authors associated to it.

3. It might be useful to have the cimports and the imports in separate blocks, since the cimports happen at compile time, and the imports happen at runtime, frequently on startup.

5 loops, best of 3: 1.09 s per loop
```

Maybe I did something wrong?

I also got this doctest error (my RC built w/o any errors) when checking the rings/polynomial dir.

```
File "/scratch/scratch/schilly/sage/sage-4.5.2.rc0/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx", line 474:
    sage: f(x) is f
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

Btw, the doctest failure in the tutorial I reported earlier is fixed.

The system were I did run this is Ubuntu 8.10 32 bit, gcc version 4.3.2 (Ubuntu 4.3.2-1ubuntu12),  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU    Q9400

Hi Robert and Harald,

Thank you for looking at this.

About the first problem (the ``f(x) is f`` issue), I won't fix this on this ticket yet since I believe this doctest simply should not be merged into 4.5.2 and I don't want to play catching up with the moving target that a current release candidate is.  If this doctest does end up getting into 4.5.2, I'll adjust it on this ticket as soon as 4.5.2 is out.

The second problem Robert mentions is a 32-bit versus 64-bit issue.  I'm sorry I've missed this, in particular since in the same file there is a similar issue already which I did attend to.  Anyway, I've got an updated patch (just replacing ``31`` by ``64``) which I'll upload later.  With this, all tests pass on sage.math.

Thanks again,

Sebastian

It looks like the compiler is compiling for a different standard to what the code is. Changing to C99 mode might cure it, but that can cause problems too, as some code may not compile in C99 mode - there are some compatibility issues. 

The Solaris headers are stricter than the Linux ones, so something things that you can get away with on linux, you can't on Solaris. For example, the macro infinity is not defined until C99, but linux header seems to define it irrespective of what mode the compiler is in. For Solaris, the compiler will have to be set to C99 otherwise it wont work. 

I've no idea precisely what the problem is here, as others have suggested, it looks like the code does not agree with what the compiler is set to.

It would be a lot less confusing if people used gcc to compile C and g++ to compile C++. What next, g++ to compile Fortran? 

It would be nice to get rid of the endless warnings like:

```
cc1plus: warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid for Ada/C/ObjC but not for C++
```

Note that `gcc` is not the C compiler, but a compiler *driver* (and GCC is the GNU *Compiler Collection*, renamed years ago).

So it's in general pretty ok to use `gcc` to preprocess, assemble or link files, compile C, C++ or even Fortran files with `gcc`, but one should pass the appropriate options (and e.g. libraries that are *not* added by default in that case) depending on the source language.

Of course using `gjc` for Java, `g++` for C++ and `gfortran` for Fortran is less confusing (and perhaps less error-prone).

> It would be nice to get rid of the endless warnings like:

{{{

}}}

Again *ceterum censeo ...* (I don't recall how often I complained about that).

Also, (besides `libcsage.*`) `libstdc++.*` is linked to each and every extension module regardless of the `language`.

Note also that the XPG6 / C99 issue is not an upstream (FLINT) problem, since FLINT is C, not C++, but we compile FLINT source code as C++.

In addition, the Solaris headers are patched by GCC's `fix-includes`, so I'm not sure who's to blame for the failure. The relevant test should certainly also make a distinction on C++.

On the Solaris build error: From `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/module_list.py`:

```python
    Extension('sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_rational_flint',
              sources = ['sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx', 'sage/libs/flint/fmpq_poly.c'],
              language = 'c++',
              extra_compile_args=["-std=c99", "-D_XPG6"],
              libraries = ["csage", "flint", "ntl", "gmpxx", "gmp"],
              include_dirs = [SAGE_ROOT + '/local/include/FLINT/', SAGE_ROOT + '/devel/sage/sage/libs/flint/'],
              depends = [SAGE_ROOT + "/local/include/FLINT/flint.h"]),
```
If I understand correctly (and to recap, somewhat):

* The `language` option just tells Cython to create a C++ file `polynomial_rational_flint.cpp` from the Cython file `polynomial_rational_flint.pyx`, so that we can compile the .cpp file with NTL's C++ headers, etc.
* The `extra_compile_args` here are really only for compiling the C99 file `fmpq_poly.c`.  But distutils also uses them (and `-Wstrict-prototypes`) to compile `polynomial_rational_flint.cpp`, too.  This can give the warnings

```
cc1plus: warning: command line option "-std=c99" is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++
cc1plus: warning: command line option "-Wstrict-prototypes" is valid for Ada/C/ObjC but not for C++
```
* We need `-std=c99` to compile the C99 file `fmpq_poly.c`.  Using `-std=gnu99` instead, gives, e.g.,

```
In file included from /usr/include/time.h:22:0,
                 from /home/mpatel/build/fulvia/sage-4.6.alpha1pre-4000/local/include/FLINT/zmod_poly.h:35,
                 from /home/mpatel/build/fulvia/sage-4.6.alpha1pre-4000/local/include/FLINT/fmpz_poly.h:40,
                 from sage/libs/flint/fmpq_poly.h:22,
                 from sage/libs/flint/fmpq_poly.c:15:
/usr/include/sys/types.h:536:23: error: duplicate ‘unsigned’
```
 The other extra argument, `-D_XPG6` is technically correct, as Bill says, but causes problems with gcc on Solaris.

Are there any objections to using

```python
              extra_compile_args=["-std=c99"] + uname_specific('SunOS', [], ['-D_XPG6']),
```
instead?

I would really appreciate if this got fixed in a proper way, and not with yet another work-around.

I.e., IMHO one should
* **drop the** `language="c++"` (since it is in fact C code),
* clean up - unfortunately lots of - Cython header files (`.pxi`, `.pxd`) to not rather randomly include NTL[-related] wrappers / headers which trigger the need for C++. Some `.pyx` files then have to explicitly include these elsewhere omitted ones (but IIRC only `sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pyx`).
* Remove `"ntl"` and `"gmpxx"` from `libraries`.

I've actually given up to complete the second step, since for some reason Cython insists to put both

```C
#include "ntl_wrap.h"
```
and

```C
#include "FLINT/NTL-interface.h"
```
into the generated `polynomial_rational_flint.c` (for me, line 168 and 170).

If I manually remove these two lines, the extension module gets properly built and apparently works.

If we solve just the XPG6 issue (by getting around the bad Solaris headers), but keep the underlying cause, I'm pretty sure we'll revisit the same problem (needing to compile C code as if it was C++) soon.

Perhaps one should ask the authors why they added `language="c++"`; I guess just because they ran into the real problem.

P.S.: The `-Wstrict-prototypes` is a separate Cython / distutils problem. Perhaps fixed in Cython 0.13 (Robert B. is well aware of this), but I think it isn't yet.

#9741 has a doctest that uses vertices that are polynomials.  With module name changes here at #4000, one of the doctests needs to change.  I've added a bit of documentation (and expanded the test slightly) to make it clear why the fully-qualified name is being used - more discussion is on #9741.

I built this patch after applying everything up through the "hensel_lift" patch, but it should just depend on the renaming of the modules.  Tests now pass on `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` and the documentation for this module looks fine.

Personally, I think it would be best to fix it first. Otherwise it strikes me of this comment

**I am very concerned at this "release it now, we'll make it work later" mentality.**

If it is on the strict understanding it does not get into a release until fixed, then I'm OK with it. That is the purpose of alphas. But I thought the intension was to have a feature freeze after this alpha. Merging this could be dangerous thing to do. 

The ticket has been open two years - I would have thought those working on it would have had time to checked it!

On bsd.math, I get

```python
sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/buildbot/build/sage/bsd-1/bsd_full/build/sage-4.6.alpha3/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py", line 194:
    sage: NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'a').ideal(7).__hash__()
Expected:
    -9223372036854775779                 
Got:
    -288230376151711715
```
so it seems we can just update the example at line 194 in `number_field_ideal.py`, which is currently:

```python
            sage: NumberField(x^2 + 1, 'a').ideal(7).__hash__()
            -9223372036854775779                 # 64-bit
            -2147483619                          # 32-bit
```
Is is OK?

I made this ticket a 4.6 blocker three weeks ago.  The most recent doctest error appeared because of a recent change, probably in 4.6.alpha2.  Yes, I meant to say that I'd make the new ticket a 4.6 blocker.  4.6.alpha3 is not out yet and we are not yet in feature freeze.

I've added V2 of the combined patch, which adjusts the `number_field_ideal.py` example as I suggest above.

This ticket still needs a final review, and if it's positively reviewed by the time #10097 is merged, I'll merge it into 4.6.alpha3.

There's a bug in `fmpq_poly_xgcd()` that can lead to severe heap corruption, which in turn can cause almost any kind of failure.

See #11771 for details.

Patch is up there.

It would be nice if one of the many reviewers here could review my patch there. He/she should IMHO also take a look at the sizes used in other memory (re)allocations / for other variables, in `fmpq_poly_xgcd()` at least.
