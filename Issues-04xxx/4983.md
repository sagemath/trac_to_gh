I do not like this:

```
sage: sage: a = matrix(ZZ,4,[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 2])
sage: sage: b=a.jordan_form()
sage: b.subdivisions
([0, 1, 3, 4], [0, 1, 3, 4])
sage: b.subdivisions = 10
sage: b.subdivisions
10
```

Notice that you can make the subdivisions nonsense because it can be changed.
Also, of course,

```
sage: b.subdivisions?
...     The Integer class represents arbitrary precision
        integers.  It derives from the Element class, so
[other useless stuff]
```


I don't like that at all either.  I wish that subdivisions were a method with a proper docstring, doctests, etc., and that variable were hidden.


Then one would do:

```
   sage: b.subdivisions?
   useful stuff (and also it would be in the reference manual)
and
   sage: b.subdivisions()
   ([0, 1, 3, 4], [0, 1, 3, 4])
```

The method is 

```
sage: b.get_subdivisions()
([1, 3], [1, 3])
```

but this should probably be changed to have an attribute _subdivisions and a method subdivisions() for consistency.

Normally, I'd say "not."  But I have two or three  other rebase tasks for later this afternoon, so I can give it a quick test then.
