Try breaking any doctest and you get stuff like this:

```
was@sage:~/build/sage-3.2.2.alpha2$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx"     
**********************************************************************
File "/home/was/build/sage-3.2.2.alpha2/devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx", line 276, in __main__.example_6
Failed example:
    m###line 554:_sage_    >>> m

```

Notice the line 276 there.   In the old sage:

```
was@sage:~/d/sage/matrix$ sage -t matrix_modn_dense.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx"**********************************************************************
File "/home/was/s/devel/sage-main/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense.pyx", line 554:
    sage: m
Expected:
    [19 18 17]
    [16 15 14]
    [13 12 11]
Got:
```
