I am going to implement exactly one thing for this ticket. I will add an option

```
   sage -t --only-optional=comma,separated,list,of,tags file1.py dir ...
```

This will run every doctest block where at least one line in the block contains 

```
# optional - set of tags that must be *nonempty* subset of those above
```

The complete block will run, but with any # optional's that don't have tags a subset of the input to sage -t removed. 

Also, there is one special case:

```
sage -t only-optional
```
with no tages.  In this case, every doctest block that contains any # optional's is run.  All others are skipped. 

This design is joint work with Michael Abshoff.
