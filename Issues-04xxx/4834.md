Yes, definitely.  Then we don't have create a whole bunch of different
vector spaces for no reason too.

Attached worksheet does a better job of illustrating the problem.  I plan to attack this at Bug Days if it is still open.

Can we naturally coerce vectors from lower-dimensional subspaces into the obvious ambient vector space (the one with same degree, same ring or a common super-ring)?  That might be one other solution.

A workaround is to begin with symbolic matrices, which are now amenable to eigenvector computations (albeit slowly).  See #6934, #10346 (coming soon to an official release).  Then results (eigenvectors) are symbolic for starters, so they play nicely with a symbolic expression like the variable t.

```
sage: B=matrix(SR, [[1,2],[2,1]])
sage: spec=B.eigenvectors_left()
sage: spec
[(3, [(1, 1)], 1), (-1, [(1, -1)], 1)]
sage: v = spec[0][1][0]
sage: z = spec[1][1][0]
sage: z.parent()
Vector space of dimension 2 over Symbolic Ring
sage: var('t')
t
sage: v + t*z
(t + 1, -t + 1)
```

But I think an addition to the coercion system is still the best long-term solution, since these symbolic eigenvalue computations are not real robust.
