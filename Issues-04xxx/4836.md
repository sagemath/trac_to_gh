```
the pari interface relies on the function getattr(), e.g. as in

```
zk_basis = K.pari_nf().getattr('zk')
```
but I *really* don't like this function!  Each of these dot-attributes
in pari is a short-cut, in this case to `K.pari_nf()[6]`, as these are
easier when running gp than remembering which field is which in the
nf/bnf structures.  There are not very many of these (I started making
a list).  But what I do not like is the implementation of getattr() in
Sage:

```
   def getattr(self, attr):
       t0GEN(str(self) + '.' + str(attr))
       _sig_on
       return self.new_gen(t0)
```
So it converts the nf into a string (in my examples, that's a string
of length 59604), adds ".zk" to it, and reparses the input (using the gp parser).

More generally: using PARI through the string interface (i.e. `pari("some string")`) should be avoided when it might give a large overhead.

Patch applies fine to 4.6.alpha1 +  #9898 + #9753.

Tests all pass on a 32-bit machine.

In the patch:  

1. Is the first line of docstring of ideallist() a typo:   "Vector of vectors `L` of all idealstar of all ideals of `norm <= bound`. " ?  Or are you using "idealstar" in a PARI-technical sense of "ideal structure with extra data?
2. Can you explain the quotes in the patch to maps.py (e.g. "'x") 
3. I would not have minded if you had removed my old smallest_integer code instead of commenting it out!

Positive review!  Thanks for doing this.  (Did you deal with all occurrences of getattr()?)

It means the actual *variables* `x` and `y`, even if `x` and `y` have been assigned to something.  For example, try the following in `gp`:

```
gp> x = 10
%1 = 10
gp> x
%2 = 10
gp> 'x
%3 = x
```

Well, it doesn't hurt to leave to code for now, in case something breaks.
