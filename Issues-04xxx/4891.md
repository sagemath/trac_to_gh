This is 100% for testing use.  I've written this and will post a patch soon.

NOTE: Nauty has a stupid interactive license agreement which somewhat messes up this command, since it makes it not 100% automatic.    I hate that.  I've made trac #4890 to get rid of it.

Attachment [trac_4891.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4891/trac_4891.patch) by @williamstein created at 2008-12-30 07:54:50

For the record, when I run this on sage.math it takes a total of a half hour (pretty fast!) and finishes with the following:

```
...
Successfully installed valgrind_3.3.1
Now cleaning up tmp files.
Making Sage/Python scripts relocatable...
Making script relocatable
Finished installing valgrind_3.3.1.spkg
CPU times: user 0.03 s, sys: 1.54 s, total: 1.57 s
Wall time: 1925.36 s
['boehm_gc-7.1.p0', 'mpi4py-0.3.1']
```

So boehm and mpi4py failed to install.  But everything else in optional succeeded.  Note that there is  an inconsistency, since according to the output of optional_packages() in fact mpi4py and fricas failed but everything else succeeded:

```
 ['fricas-1.0.3.p0', 'mpi4py-0.3.1'])
```
This I think points to bugs in the package install system, not in this patch.

boehm_gc-7.1.p0 is already in standard Sage, but also in the optional repo in case someone wants to install M2 into an older version of Sage.

So the error detection (i.e., when an exception is raised) in install_packages is clearly buggy.  But I don't think that should hold this patch back, since that's a separate bug in a different function, and should be addressed in another ticket.

I propose removing it or at least moving it to experimental, since M2 is only in experimental after all.

Fine by me since we have shipped it with standard for a while. Maybe the install_package routine should be smarter about already installed spkgs, too?
