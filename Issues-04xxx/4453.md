For any elliptic curve over QQ of rank >= 2 the heegner_index command must always give +Infinity as output.   So the following 1 at the end is just wrong.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: D = E.heegner_discriminants_list(1)[0]
sage: D
-7
sage: E.heegner_index(D)
1
```

Apply trac_4453-rebased.patch and 4453-doctest-fix.patch

Positive review: looks good (apart from a docstring typo "We higher rank examples") and applies fine to 4.3.1, tests pass and docs build & look good.

I added a new patch which changes the above to "Some higher rank examples" with no further changes.

this patch still applies fine to 4.7.1, and the new examples in the patch seem to work.
However the description says that the following should give 0 and not `+Infinity`:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: E.heegner_index(-7)
+Infinity
```
Is the description wrong?
