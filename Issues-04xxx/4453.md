For any elliptic curve over QQ of rank >= 2 the heegner_index command must always give +Infinity as output.   So the following 1 at the end is just wrong.

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: D = E.heegner_discriminants_list(1)[0]
sage: D
-7
sage: E.heegner_index(D)
1
```

Apply trac_4453-rebased.patch and 4453-doctest-fix.patch

However the description says that the following should give 0 and not `+Infinity`:

```
