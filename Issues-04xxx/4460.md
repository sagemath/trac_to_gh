Adding a link to the PDF versions of the manuals from the /html/index.html page. Both, useful locally and on the website. But I don't know how this page is generated (i get errors or nothing happens) and it isn't even under revision control. Here my improvised patch:

```
add in /sage/devel/doc-main/html/index.html.in at line 88:
------------
 <ul>
	    <li> <font size=+2><a href="../paper-$(PAPER)/" class="title">PDF Versions</a></font>
	      <br>
	  </ul>
-------------
```

An enhancement would be to link to each .pdf file directly, something like "link to html (PDF)" for each link.

On the other hand, if I click on the "Help" button from the notebook, then click on "Fast static versions of the Documentation", then the I see pdf links but they don't work: I get messages like "The resource /pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf cannot be found."

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A6):
> On the other hand, if I click on the "Help" button from the notebook, then click on "Fast static versions of the Documentation", then the I see pdf links but they don't work: I get messages like "The resource /pdf/en/tutorial/SageTutorial.pdf cannot be found."

Thanks very much for catching this.  I think v2 covers both the static and offline docs.

Aside:  In the drive for internationalization, perhaps we should instead map `doc/common/output` to, e.g., `http://localhost:8000/doc/static` and serve `index.html` as `http://localhost:8000/doc/static/html/` + `LANG` + `/index.html`.

Correction:  That should be

```
convert $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/moin/htdocs/applets/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/images/icons/pdf.gif $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/website/static/pdf.png

Is there an option to turn off this linking to the PDF version of the documents from the HTML version? Currently, we distribute the standard documentation in two standalone formats: as PDF and as HTML; see

http://www.sagemath.org/help.html

The HTML version currently doesn't link to the PDF version, and I think there should be an option to stay with the current situation. If I understand the patch correctly, there is no option to turn off the linking to the PDF version (correct me if I'm wrong).
