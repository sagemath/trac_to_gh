This patch adds Kerberos authentification support for the SAGE notebook. It also adds the options krb_srv, krb_realm for the notebook() command.

This patch however depends on pykerberos which depends on kerberos which depends on a couple of other libraries all in all a little less size than SAGE itself and all not in SAGE :-). Nevertheless ...

Hi,

I like the design of this patch and how the kerberos stuff is optional.  

Unfortunately, this is hard to referee if you don't explain to me how to install pykerberos.  Also, the patch itself should contain code that says "hey, you need kerberos, and here's how to install it" when the user turns on kerberos via an option to notebook, but 

```
import kerberos
```
fails.  That could be either a paragraph of text, an optional spkg to install, or a link to a wiki page that describes what to do.  

OK?

Thanks!
