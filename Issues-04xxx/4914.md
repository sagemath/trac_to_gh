Regarding (1), those changes haven't been merged into Sage.

I'll post a patch for (2).

For (3), I think all of the linear groups stuff was there before they got moved out into their own files.

Yes, anything not in Sage will likely need to be rebased. The fast that the ReST conversion is coming has been known for *many weeks* and was mentioned numerous times on sage-devel.

It was my fault. I posted the patch following the referee's suggestions but simply forgot to relabel the ticket "needs review".
