I'll post a patch for (2).

Yes, anything not in Sage will likely need to be rebased. The fast that the ReST conversion is coming has been known for *many weeks* and was mentioned numerous times on sage-devel.

Absolutely, but given the wide publicity this received no one can reading sage-devel can claim to be surprised by this. And this shows exactly why people need to be behind their patches to get them reviewed so that they don't bitrot.
