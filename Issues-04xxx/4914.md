Regarding (1), those changes haven't been merged into Sage.

I'll post a patch for (2).

For (3), I think all of the linear groups stuff was there before they got moved out into their own files.

Yes, anything not in Sage will likely need to be rebased. The fast that the ReST conversion is coming has been known for *many weeks* and was mentioned numerous times on sage-devel.

Absolutely, but given the wide publicity this received no one can reading sage-devel can claim to be surprised by this. And this shows exactly why people need to be behind their patches to get them reviewed so that they don't bitrot.

latex-fix-4914.patch is a one-character change that's necessary to allow generation of the PDF docs.  Note that this is not in any way a review of the original patch; I haven't even looked at it.
