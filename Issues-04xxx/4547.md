This causes Apache rewriting for example to just display plain text instead of HTML.  This hasn't been an issue because browsers are relatively smart about dealing with unspecified Content-Types.

I rebased Mike's patch against 3.3.alpha6, and added a "charset: utf-8" bit; this ticket is in some sense the other half of #5211.

This ticket was originally motivated by Apache rewriting; I'm here because some users have UTF-8 text in their worksheets and browsers are not always figuring out the correct encoding. If my patch fixes the encoding/browser problems, perhaps we should merge this ticket and open another for adding Content-Type headers to CSS, Javascript, and so on.
