This causes Apache rewriting for example to just display plain text instead of HTML.  This hasn't been an issue because browsers are relatively smart about dealing with unspecified Content-Types.

I rebased Mike's patch against 3.3.alpha6, and added a "charset: utf-8" bit; this ticket is in some sense the other half of #5211.

This ticket was originally motivated by Apache rewriting; I'm here because some users have UTF-8 text in their worksheets and browsers are not always figuring out the correct encoding. If my patch fixes the encoding/browser problems, perhaps we should merge this ticket and open another for adding Content-Type headers to CSS, Javascript, and so on.

This patch requires two trivial fixes unless these are provided via some other patch as a dependency:

```
sage-3.4.1.alpha0$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py 
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py"    
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py", line 139:
    sage: response.headers
Expected:
    <Headers: Raw: {'content-type': ['text/html']} Parsed: {'content-type': <RecalcNeeded>}>
Got:
    <Headers: Raw: {'content-type': ['text/html; charset=utf-8']} Parsed: {'content-type': <RecalcNeeded>}>
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-3.4.1.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/twist.py", line 1511:
