This patch touches a lot of files in a trivial automatic way.  They main point is it changes the _magma_init_ signature from 

_magma_init_(self)

to 

_magma_init_(self, magma)

where magma is a magma interface.  Also, it introduces some caching for the magma interface itself.  This means that _magma_init_ has access to and can impact the full state of the magma interpreter.   This makes creating a string representation of an element valid for that interpreter dramatically more powerful and flexible, is conceptually very easy to understand, and works.  The caching helps mediate potential efficiency issues. 

Note, whether caching should be on or off by default is unclear, and I think can only be answered by implementing a lot more of this framework and doing some profiling.

I've decided caching is not the default, since I don't want to blatantly introduce memory leaks. The second patch implements this change (one line change), plus changes all _magma_init_()'s to appropriate _magma_init_(magma).
