matrix_modn_sparse needs some housecleaning.  One gem, in particular:

```
    cdef Py_ssize_t i, j, k
    k = 0
    for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows:
        for j from 0 <= j < self.rows[i].num_nonzero:
            k+=1
    return QQ(k)/QQ(self.nrows()*self.ncols()) 
```

also, it could use some fast nonzero_positions, getitem, etc. methods

I agree, this file needs a lot of cleanup.

I fixed the one example Tom mentioned above ... lots more needs to be done, but I thought it would be good to close this and open a new series of specific tickets (most of which will probably get handled at SD12 in San Diego).

Positive review. I change the summary to properly reflect what you fixed.

As you pointed out followup should happen via individual tickets.
