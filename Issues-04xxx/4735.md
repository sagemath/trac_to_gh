+1, this was my first though when I started reading your email. I  
don't think it makes sense for other constants, but for E it  
certainly does. Also, I'd just call exp (not _exp), making sure that  
it doesn't introduce a recursive call...

Yes. When you do exp(A) it attempts to return A.exp() before doing  
anything symbolic.

To do this, you'd have to add a check before every `__pow__` operation with elements of SR, which may or may not be too much overhead.

I'm changing the title to address the actual problem reported.

Can you think of a solution to the problem that this doesn't work, though?

```
sage: A = matrix(SR, [[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: exp(A)
[-1/22*((sqrt(33) - 11)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33) - 11)*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)              2/33*(sqrt(33)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33))*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)]
[             1/11*(sqrt(33)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33))*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)  1/22*((sqrt(33) + 11)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33) + 11)*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)]
sage: A.exp()
[-1/22*((sqrt(33) - 11)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33) - 11)*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)              2/33*(sqrt(33)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33))*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)]
[             1/11*(sqrt(33)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33))*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)  1/22*((sqrt(33) + 11)*e^sqrt(33) - sqrt(33) + 11)*e^(-1/2*sqrt(33) + 5/2)]
sage: e^A
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: mutable matrices are unhashable
```
I get the same problem with entries in `RR`, and the original post noted `RDF` is also a problem.

I wonder if this is more calculus or more linear algebra... maybe a different component?

This is a **heavily** requested feature, so I've added a number of examples, as well as added the original file in question to the reference manual (though the new doc there from the first patch doesn't show up since it's in a double-underscore method).  The complex matrices were in particular demand, so thank you so much for fixing this.

I've added enough that, though it passes tests, I'd appreciate a further review to make sure I didn't do something silly.  Positive review for Mike's patch.
