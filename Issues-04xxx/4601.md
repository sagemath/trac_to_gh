This ticket changes the signature of `_magma_` and `_magma_init_` slightly to pass in the interface -- which makes a MASSIVE amount of sense if you think about it. Also, the magma interface takes care of caching of values, which also makes sense.

There is some redundancy -- the generic infrastructure also separately caches stuff as well. This will be eliminated in a future ticket.  The key point about this patch is that it applies cleanly to 3.2.1.alpha0 *and* it works -- it fixes all problems in trac's #4482, #4401 and #4399.

this patch should be applied to sage-3.2.1.alpha0.  it should fix *all* optional doctest failures related to the magma interface!  Note that there is a problem with -only_optional=magma (#4600) so doctesting with that will still show a few false errors.

There is one slight problem here with the doctests:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py           
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.1.alpha1/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py", line 1559:
    sage: magma(S.gen_names()[1])
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

      File "<doctest __main__.example_52[3]>", line 1, in <module>
        magma(S.gen_names()[Integer(1)])###line 1559:
    sage: magma(S.gen_names()[1])
    NameError: name 'S' is not defined
**********************************************************************
```
But that is obviously easy to fix :)

I have read the patch and while it wouldn't hurt that mhansen for example would take another look everything looks peachy :)

Cheers,

Merged in Sage 3.2.1.alpha1 - I will put a reviewers patch for the doctest issue in a second for completeness sake.
