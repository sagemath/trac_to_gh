Hi guys,

I sat around and was looking at the new ReST Words documentation and
noticed the following:

[5:40pm] mabs: WTF:
[5:40pm] mabs: sage: Words(7,13).count()
[5:40pm] mabs: 96889010407L              # 32-bit
[5:40pm] mabs: 96889010407                # 64-bit
[5:40pm] mabs: So Words().count() returns a Python int?
[5:40pm] wstein: ick
[5:40pm] wstein: That stupid L at theend was suck an annoying decision by Guido.

I would expect that count() returns a Sage Integer since that seems to
be the expected result in general. If you agree please open a ticket,
but this is not a high priority issue for me.

Cheers,

Michael
