I've applied all the necessary patches to a 3.1.3alpha1 tree, but when I try to start Sage, I get:

That's just the last part of the traceback; the rest doesn't seem so interesting...but let me know if you want to see it.

I've looked through the patches from 4134, 2407, and this ticket, and I don't see where the file `admin_add_user.template` is created. I have all those patches applied (except 4134, which has already been merged); how do I get that file?

I applied mhansen's patch to a clean 3.3.alpha3 tree, deleted my .sage/sage_notebook directory to start fresh, but I still get problems: I log in, click "Manage Users", click "Add user", then put in a name and hit "Create account". The resulting page is blank and has the title "Error | Sage Notebook".

If I hit the back button to get back to the "add a user" page, then click cancel, I get to the user management page, which lists the user I tried to add.

If I click on the user's name, I go to the usual "home page", and it lists the user's name as if I am logged in as that user...but I thought I was logged in as admin? If I then click on Settings, I can go to the user management page and...well, manage users.

Right now, this patch seems to need work. Am I doing something wrong?

There is a new '__temporary_password' variable, but that doesn't seem to be used.\n\nWhen one adds a new user, you get a page saying \"The temporary password for the new user foo is 52oN5g2a\". Unfortunately, that password does not seem to be temporary; the new user can log in and out, and back in again with that password. When I read \"temporary password\", I think that the user will be able to log in once, and then be forced to change the password right away.\n\nAnother problem with the temporary password page is that the title of the page is \"Error\", even though there's no error.\n\nThat said: this patch, along with #6856 (which I just positively reviewed) does give us the basic functionality for adding users and resetting passwords from inside the notebook, which is something I'd really like.

Replying to [@wjp](#comment%3A27):
> I don't understand how (or if?) this patch implements the mentioned temporary password functionality. There is a new '__temporary_password' variable, but that doesn't seem to be used.

When one adds a new user, you get a page saying "The temporary password for the new user foo is 52oN5g2a". Unfortunately, that password does not seem to be temporary; the new user can log in and out, and back in again with that password. When I read "temporary password", I think that the user will be able to log in once, and then be forced to change the password right away.

Another problem with the temporary password page is that the title of the page is "Error", even though there's no error.

That said: this patch, along with #6856 (which I just positively reviewed) does give us the basic functionality for adding users and resetting passwords from inside the notebook, which is something I'd really like. The last patch applies cleanly to 4.1.1. What do people think of merging this and opening a new ticket to fix the temporary password bits? (Or changing this patch so that it doesn't claim that the new password is temporary?)

I'd agree with not holding up this patch because of this, because it is already a very useful feature to have.

This patch does probably have to be rebased against #6568, though.

I tried applying the patch here on top of a 4.1.1 tree that already had the patches from those three tickets applied, and I get a different hunk that won't apply. Perhaps I'll wait for the alpha0 tarball to be released and rebase the patch here based on that...or, you could `hg serve` your merge tree and let me pull from that.
