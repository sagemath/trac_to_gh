The spkg is here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/ondrej/spkg/sympy-0.6.3.spkg

and also apply the attached patch, that fixes one failing test in test_sympy.py.

The Sage tests are still running, I'll report if all pass.

Component: **calculus**

Ondrej,

in the future make sure to use the sympy.spkg from the tree, not the one you build last time since the one in tree contains various cleanups from the review. Next time you do not use the latest upstream the review on my end will be an automatic "needs work" since I am tired of forward porting fixes I have done over and over again.

Cheers,

Michael
