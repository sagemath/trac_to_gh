Hi,

I am not sure how to report bugs in Sage but I see you are involved
with their coding theory. I was playing around with BCH codes and
in particular I wanted the BCH code over F_5 of length 26 and designed
distance 5. Sage reports this code as having dimension 25 (see below)
but the dimension should be 10, which Magma computes correctly (see
below also).

Thanks 

Felipe

10
```

Incidently, Guava does this correctly. The problem is that I used the wrong element to construct the generator polynomial. 

This is fixed in the attached patch, based on 3.1.2.alpha4. It passes sage -testall and also adds a test in the docstring to include the example reported by Felipe.
