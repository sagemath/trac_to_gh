Comment:  What's wrong here is the logic in parsing mwrank's output for a curve (and there are many) where the lower and upper bounds for the rank as computed by mwrank are not equal.  Here the lower bound is 0 and the upper bound is 2.  This is the *correct* mwrank output for a curve whose rank is 0 and whose Tate-Shafarevich group has 2-rank equal to 2.

The correct behaviour for Sage in this case is:  if proof==True, raise a run-time error (since mwrank by itself is incapable of find the rank for such a curve);  if proof==False, return a rank of 0 silently, showing a warning if the appropriate misc.verbose flag is set.

I think that this is what the Sage code is trying to do, but it is not doing it correctly at present.

OK, so that's an informed diagnosis but but not yet a cure!

Review:  

Patch applies fine to 3.3.alpha0.  Tests in elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py pass (but not with -long, see below).

I think this is ok.  It handles the case where the lower and upper bounds of the rank, as output by mwrank,  are not equal. 

At first I was not sure that it handled properly the case where the bounds are equal (so the rank is known for sure) but the saturation step is incomplete, but it's ok:

```
sage: EllipticCurve( [0,0,1,-49,132]).conductor()
26171
sage: EllipticCurve( [0,0,1,-49,132]).rank(proof=True)
3
sage: EllipticCurve( [0,0,1,-49,132]).gens(proof=False)
[(-6 : 14 : 1), (4 : -1 : 1), (5 : -4 : 1)]
sage: EllipticCurve( [0,0,1,-49,132]).gens(proof=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
Generators not provably computed.
```
[If testing the above example, do so on a Sage without the large database, else the gens will be known from there.]

This is exactly right. 

Testing with -long gives one failure but I don't see why it is a failure.  The test which fails is NOT a "long" one!  So is this a bug in the doctesting framewirk (due to the verbose output perhaps?)?

```

Perhaps the "magic three dots" used in the verbose output at several places are problematic?

I agree that from first sight, this seems to be a framework problem, not one of the code to be doctested.

That sounds plausible -- but why would it only be a problem when the -long flag is set?
