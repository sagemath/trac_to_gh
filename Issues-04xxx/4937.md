Testing for #4901 has revealed a bug (an embarrassing one in code of mine) in _p_primary_torsion_basis() as exemplified here:

```
 sage: p=10^60+3201
sage: K=GF(p)
sage: a=804515977734860566494239770982282063895480484302363715494873

sage: E=EllipticCurve(K,[0,a,0,b,0])
sage: E.cardinality().factor()
2^17 * 13115567671 * 581705246972988608203110387504181554514650287
sage: E._p_primary_torsion_basis(2)

[[(656068448840236768725810484116830935925716002501543862440466 : 324360550482744921974063628110267202720852104214117741680354 : 1),

```
Here the 2-sylow subgroup has structure `2^16 * 2` but E._p_primary_torsion_basis(2) only gives `2<sup>2*2</sup>1`.  I know what the problem is and am working out how to fix it.

NB This function is called in ell_torsion.py in computing torsion groups over number fields, which is rather likely to give wrong answers (though not over Q where pari is used ;)) until this is fixed.  Hence I made this a separate ticket marked "major defect"!

Michael: I set the milestone for this as 3.3 since it's a potentially serious bug in this corner of Sage, but feel free to bump it up.  I hope I might be able to fix it tonight but if not then it will take a few days as teaching starts again tomorrow...

John,

this is fine as long as it applies after the ReST conversion. There are already a bunch of tickets lined up, so 3.3 will contain a bunch of fixes besides the ReST conversion.

Cheers,

Michael
