The code supporting binary quadratic forms, in quadratic_forms/binary_qf.py, is missing some functionality.  The patch in this ticket provides the following changes:
- better support for indefinite forms
- tests for equivalence, positive and negative definite, indefinite, primitive forms
- action of matrix on a form
- find content
- is_reduced() is rewritten
- polynomial() now uses an instance variable (poly)
- some general cleaning up

Doctests are in place for the new code, so the file remains at 100% coverage.

Justin,

the diff is inverse and you should also add an extension patch to the file.

Cheers,

This is a third patch, applied on sage-4120-2.patch.

This one extends support for indefinite forms and fixes a few bugs (both in code and in the Buchmann/Vollmer algorithms).

One change in particular deserves discussion: I have changed the normalization and reduction procedures to return both the form in question and the transformation matrix used to derive that form.  This makes things a bit more awkward in the code, so there are two questions: is this really useful, and if yes, is there a better way to do it?

Also, I assigned this to me :-}.

My patch sage-trac4120new.patch combines the three earlier ones and adds the following:
* Fixing various bugs and typos
* Sorting out a lot of formatting issues in doctests
* Adds some new functions
* Renames Mul to `__mul__` so one can say Q*M to apply matrix M to form Q

Regarding the latter I relented and removed the scale parameter;  since the det is either +1 or -1 I am happy with multiplying (or dividing) by the determinant.

Issues do remain:
* The various transform function which return a new form Q and a transform T really must satisfy self.T==Q, but they don't.  Hence the commented out assertions.
* We must decide whether we are talking about weak or strict equivalence (GL or SL(2,ZZ)).  At the moment it is hard to tell which.
* For indefinite forms there are several different notions of "reduced".  OK to to stick to one, but we should make this explicit.
* The class number function looks inefficient to me, it should be replaced by the fast code by Skoruppa to list reduced forms (in the definite case at least).

That's all I can remember, but this will need more work before it can go in.

To comment on the relationship with #4470:

```
AFAIK the binary quadratic forms are untouched by Jon's work. We
should rename the file to bring it more in line with what is coming
from Jon, i.e. all I have left to do to post a patch is to rename
various files to qf_ from quadratic_forms_, fix the imports and rebase
the extensions to module_list.py. All trivial, it just needs to be
done :p

I've reviewed the code from the last patch as submitted by John Cremona (sage-trac4120.new.patch). It applies cleanly on 3.3 and also on top of the first two patches in #4470.

Below are some comments about the code in `binary_qf.py`. I didn't make a difference between old code and code in the patch, since most of the code is in the patch, anyway.

- Constructor:
  - BinaryQF([1,2,3], 4, 5) should raise an error
  - I would like to suggest an additional constructor:

     ```
        sage: BinaryQF(2, 1, disc = -23)
        2*x^2 + x*y + 3*y^2
    ```
    this is handy when the discriminant is fixed and one knows the first two coefficients
    of a form

- `__repr__`:
   
  I don't like the fact that a quadratic form is represented by a polynomial, may lead
  to potential confusion. What about something like:
  "`Binary quadratic form over Integer Ring with coefficients [a, b, c]`"
  ?

- polynomial:
  - the variables for the polynomial are hardcoded... 'x' and 'y'... not very important (I rather not have a "polynomial" function... I'd replace it by a `__call__` function which works for elements in any ring, then one can call e.g. `Q(x,y)` where x and y are in `ZZ['x,y']`, etc.

- action by matrices:
  - Q * M is a left action --> more natural to be right action!!
    I.e. right now

     ```
        sage: Q = BinaryQF(4,-4,15)
        sage: M = matrix(ZZ, 2, [1, 1, 0, 1])
        sage: M1 = matrix(ZZ, 2, [1, 0, 1, 1])
        sage: Q * M * M1 == Q * (M * M1)
        False
        sage: Q * M * M1 == Q * (M1 * M)
        True
    ```
  - I like the notation `Q(M)` for the action of matrices -- this is consitent with the
    notation for general quadratic forms and representation by vectors or sublattices (#4470)
     

    Maybe * should be reserved for composition?

- is_normal: he doctest doesn't explain what it is

- is_equivalent
  - IMO should return True or False
  - have extra parameter to request transformation matrix
  - needs more doctests (in particular indefinite, etc)
  - sage: Q * Q.is_equivalent(Q1)[1].transpose() == Q1 /// should be True
   this is just an issue with the action of matrices being left action
  - for indefinite: should not compute the cycle for every form!!
   instead, compute `self * other^(-1)`  (in the class group), and check if it is in the
   principal cycle, which should of course be cached once for each discriminant. This is
   helpful since one will probably use many forms of the same discriminant together.
    

   Not sure about how to do memory management though: it'd be nice if every indefinite
   form of discriminant D holds a reference to the principal cycle of discriminant D, so
   the cycle is deleted when the last indefinite form of discriminant D is deleted ???
    

   ALSO: IMO the caching of the cycle should be done by the function Cycle() itself, not by
   is_equivalent.
    

   Moreover, the cycle needs to cache the transformation matrix as well, so we can
   actually figure out the correct transformation matrix.

- matrix: should be the Hessian for consistency with the rest of the code ???
  the advantage is that it makes the matrix over ZZ (with even diagonal)

- is_zero: should not need a gcd to decide if it is 0

- s and ss: internal, should be prepended with `__` ???

- class number computation should use pari

- implement conversions between pari <--> sage   for BinaryQF and Qfb
  maybe try to wrap around pari functionality as much as possible, for speed ??? (both
  runtime and development!!) E.g. composition, etc.

I guess my commits can count as reviewer patches.  However, I haven't reviewed all the new code in detail, so the branch should probably still be reviewed as a whole.

It seems that at least the patchbot "eddy" is testing this ticket without adverse effects.  Let's see what happens if I set it back to "needs_review".  (There was a failure in the last patchbot run, but it seems to be unrelated to this ticket.)

cf. the patch part:

```

Some changes I made:
- removed `@cached_method` in `polynomial` as we already cache in `_poly`
- `reduced_form(self, matrix=False, implementation=None):` `matrix` seems missleading to me. 
  changed the keywords to `transformation` and `algorithm` to stay consistent with other 
  parts of sage (for example .`hermite_form`)   
- used long names for methods like `is_indef` but keep the short alias
- ``_RhoTau(self, proper=False)``
  removed the `proper` keyword as it is not used.
- use a better bound for `a` in BinaryQF_reduced_representatives from the Buchmann/Vollmer book
- added a keyword proper for is_equivalent as for indefinite forms we only test improper 
  equivalence, we check if the form is in the cycle of the other form but that cycle is improper

Question:
- This requires a deprecation - do we really want to change it? This ticket changes so much   
  already I would vote against it:

  ```
  -def BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(D, primitive_only=False):
  +def BinaryQF_reduced_representatives(D, primitive_only=True):
  ```
