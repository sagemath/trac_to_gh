Current behavior is that `@`interact cells automatically evaluate upon opening a worksheet.  This can cause problems if (for instance) the cell depends on other cells which are not automatically evaluated, and also can take a long time if there are lots of them.  

Since other cells do not auto-evaluate, and since this functionality still is easily available by putting #auto in the cell, this ticket calls for the current behavior to be changed.

I think to solve this trac ticket, it is necessary that:

1. Output of interact cells should be completely empty when a worksheet is open.

2. `@`interact needs to work with #auto (or %auto?) because I have a project with a student that involves making a bunch of interacts that are all %hideall'd, so one sees *only* the controls.

I've posted a patch which does not enqueue interact cells at startup and deletes their output so that users don't think that they're running.

I've also made a ticket to fix the auto-evaluation at https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/5020 .  I think this is a separate issue, and I'm looking into it.
