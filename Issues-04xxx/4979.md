See http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f037b3c4cc4509eb for a discussion about the problem.

xdg-open is not available on Solaris, so we should be using a Solaris specific mechanism to open the default browser. It is unclear at least to me at the moment what this would be.

Cheers,

Michael

We should use sdtwebclient for now on Solaris since it is the default way to open a url by the default system browser on Solaris:

```
-bash-3.00$ /usr/dt/bin/sdtwebclient --help
/usr/dt/bin/sdtwebclient[117]: getopts: help bad option(s)
Usage: sdtwebclient [-b browser] [-o browser_opts] url-string
-bash-3.00$ man sdtwebclient
No manual entry for sdtwebclient. [:(]
```

Cheers,

Michael

I've just seen a bug report of this on sci.math.symbolic and comp.unix.solaris. 

I found this bug report on comp.unix.solaris and sci.math.symbolic

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.solaris/msg/ce5b85e425cdcb90?hl=en

I thought this has been fixed on a recent patch, but I must admit I can't find it. This obviously needs solving asap. I'll work on this.
