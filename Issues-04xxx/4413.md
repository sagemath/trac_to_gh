}
```
The following code, entered in the command-line interface to Sage, shows the effect:

```
sage: def foo(x):
   ....:     '''
   ....:     Eh?
Object `Eh` not found.
   ....:     '''
   ....:     return x
   ....: 
```
The parser appears to act on the '?' right away, rather than wait for the end of the thing being defined (or realizing that '?' in this case is not to be acted on).

The effect shows up with both single- and double- quotes, and with and without the "raw" qualifier (r!''').

This may be related to Trac#4405.



Depends on #12719
