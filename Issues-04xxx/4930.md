Unfortunately the spkg at #3785 contained a buglet: the patches Make.top isn't copied into the right directory, so "make install" doesn't copy over libatlas.so, libcblas.so and libf77blas.so. Due to that on some machines rpy won't load due to a missing libatlas.so.

An spkg with that fixed is coming up.

Cheers,

Michael

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/atlas-3.8.2.p0.spkg

fixes the issue. The only "real" difference is this:

The location of the ATLAS src was adjusted from src/ATLAS to src, so the improvements to Make.top were not copied correctly. This caused libatlas.so, libcblas.so and libf77blas.so not to be copied over for "make install".
