# Issue 4930: [with spkg, positive review] 3.2.3.rc0: Fix bug in ATLAS' spkg-install that breaks the install target for dynamic libs

Unfortunately the spkg at #3785 contained a buglet: the patches Make.top isn't copied into the right directory, so "make install" doesn't copy over libatlas.so, libcblas.so and libf77blas.so. Due to that on some machines rpy won't load due to a missing libatlas.so.

An spkg with that fixed is coming up.

Cheers,

Michael
