```
The attached patch switches from random lifting to the fan algorithm for triangularization which work in all cases and should work with all dimensions.

I left some safeguard code in there just in case I made assumptions that aren't always true (or have some bugs).

For the record the assumptions are:
* faces are always convex
* there won't ever be faces with no vertices

(reviewing myself)

This breaks sometimes for dimensions above 3 because vertex_adajcencies() will list adjacencies that are not on the current face, but still in the polygon.  

I was just lucky with my earlier tests.  Expect an updated patch later tonight.

Now it works in all cases, all the time.  It is faster for dimensions 2 and 3.

Dimensions higher than that can take really long (like 1 second in dimension 4) to compute, but at least they work.

I would like someone familiar with polyhedrons and their triangularization to do a sanity check on the output for dimensions 4 or 5 since my level of understanding of this topic is a bit lacking.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

First of all let me say thanks for working on this.  There are some problems with these patches though:

1) They don't pass doctesting on my machine.  This is because of some output order differences.  Did you test the final combination of all three patches?  Otherwise it might be architecture-specific but looking at your code that seems unlikely.

2) In higher dimensions, "triangulation" usually means a decomposition into simplices - so in four dimensions the elements of a triangulation of a face should be tetrahedra.  It occurs to me that it would perhaps be best to write a function in the Polyhedra class that triangulates (in this sense) the polyhedra itself, and then for .triangulated_facial_incideneces() call this function on the polyhedrons generated by each face.

3) Things seem to break for bigger examples.  For instance, an octohedron:

```
sage: p_oct = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2],[1,3],[2,3]])
sage: p_oct.triangulated_facial_incidences()

[[0, [3, 4, 3]],
 [1, [2, 3, 2]],
 [2, [0, 2, 0]],
 [3, [0, 1, 0]],
 [4, [1, 6, 1]],
 [5, [6, 7, 6]],
 [6, [5, 7, 5]],
 [7, [4, 5, 4]]]
```

Notice that the triangulation consists of the edges.

Do you have a reference for the algorithm you are using, or are you coming up with one yourself?

I think I should never post patches past midnight, because this is when I always forget something like this.

This is what I expected.  Since the polyhedron itself is in 2D the edges are in 1D so they correspond to the edges.  I asked you this question before with a square and you told me it was normal.  

If it is not supposed to do that, then facial_incidences() is broken.  Take a look at it.

> Do you have a reference for the algorithm you are using, or are you coming up with one yourself?

I am more or less coming up with it myself.  The actual triangulation of 2D surfaces is pretty standard in computer graphics (walk the points of the polygon building a triangle strip) but it obviously does not cover the cases where surfaces are in 4D.  That's where I innovate (or just do something random it seems).

First, sorry for the delay, I got swamped with other work to do.

The failure is due to me (cluelessly) assuming that every vertex is only connected to dim()-1 other vertices.  So basically almost all the other test cases worked by luck.

I think there should be a quick and easy method for 3d polygons to have fast rendering.  

But I'm still working on the general method and discovering that your example breaks almost all assumptions I had left.  It should work for real after that.
