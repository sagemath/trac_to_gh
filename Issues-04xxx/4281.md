This is for the file ell_tate_curve.py. I was unable to doctest the _height function, which is used
as a closure. Also, the missing loads(dumps(..)) test fails:

```
sage: e = EllipticCurve('130a1')
sage: eq = e.tate_curve(5)
sage: eq == loads(dumps(eq))
False
```

I agree with Chris. Probably Robert attached the wrong patch. This one (4281-tate-pickle.patch)
is already in 3.1.4 but the loads/dumps problem is still there:

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------

sage: e = EllipticCurve('130a1')
sage: eq = e.tate_curve(5)
sage: eq == loads(dumps(eq))
False

N.B. To apply the second patch properly I had to rename it to trac_4281_2.patch:  applying the patch failed when the suffix was patch2.

Apart from that, the sequence of patches applies fine and all tests in elliptic_curves pass.

I also learnt from robertwb's patch one way in which loads(dumps(*)) can fail, so will return to the other ticket...

Strictly speaking there is still something to do. It checks if E and p are equal. In a perfect implementation this should be an elliptic curve over a local field and we should check if they are isomorphic over this field, not over Q.

But I agree that the patch fixes this by now and the ticket should be closed.

When we have a type to hold elliptic curves over local fields then this can perhaps be changed.  I also did not bother to compare the (possibly) cached power series which are part of the class's data.  As I see it, this `_cmp_` function is only there for technical Pythonic reasons, and serious mathematical functionality would not be implemented via the == operator.
