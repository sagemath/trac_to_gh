This is for the file ell_tate_curve.py. I was unable to doctest the _height function, which is used
as a closure. Also, the missing loads(dumps(..)) test fails:

```
sage: e = EllipticCurve('130a1')
sage: eq = e.tate_curve(5)
sage: eq == loads(dumps(eq))
False
```

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**Resolution:** fixed

Robert's new patch is ok, thus I give a positive review for it.

N.B. To apply the second patch properly I had to rename it to trac_4281_2.patch:  applying the patch failed when the suffix was patch2.

Apart from that, the sequence of patches applies fine and all tests in elliptic_curves pass.

I also learnt from robertwb's patch one way in which loads(dumps(*)) can fail, so will return to the other ticket...

Strictly speaking there is still something to do. It checks if E and p are equal. In a perfect implementation this should be an elliptic curve over a local field and we should check if they are isomorphic over this field, not over Q.

But I agree that the patch fixes this by now and the ticket should be closed.

When we have a type to hold elliptic curves over local fields then this can perhaps be changed.  I also did not bother to compare the (possibly) cached power series which are part of the class's data.  As I see it, this _cmp_ function is only there for technical Pythonic reasons, and serious mathematical functionality would not be implemented via the == operator.


> But I agree that the patch fixes this by now and the ticket should be closed.


Good!  Thanks.
