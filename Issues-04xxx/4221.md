Build tested on 

* OSX 10.4, 10.5
* Linux x86, x86-64, Itanium 
* Solaris x86

In total I ran 10 builds including all SkyNet machines. That obviously does not mean it actually works as intended, but the spkg passes the required build tests. Positive review.

Burcin's spkg with some small SPKG.txt cleanups can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.3/alpha2/pynac-0.1.p0.spkg


Cheers,

Michael
