Hi, these failures do not seem to be related.

In the "functional.py" case, the sign of the third entry flips (!); in the "wester.py" case, the last three digits of the third entry disagree.

Yeah, I know. The point was that these are two small failures, so one ticket seem to cover it.

Yep, I have patches that will be up shortly.
