It would be nice if there were a symbolic arg function, just like the symbolic sin, cos, etc., functions.  Then the following would happen:

```
sage: f = arg(x); f
arg(x)
sage: f.subs(x=1+I)
arg(1+I)
```

Now we have

```
sage: arg(1+I)
0.785398163397
sage: type(arg(1+I))
<type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>
```

I.e., the arg in Sage is currently the numerical person's arg, not the symbolic person's.  It just casts to CDF.

Yes, this is an enhancement since it is implementing new functionality. 
It would be a bug fix if there were a bug in the existing arg function, where it produced invalid results on supported input.

I think the Maxima translation may not be correct.

```

 -- Function: carg (<z>)
     Returns the complex argument of <z>.  The complex argument is an
     angle `theta' in `(-%pi, %pi]' such that `r exp (theta %i) = <z>'
     where `r' is the magnitude of <z>.

     `carg' is a computational function, not a simplifying function.

     See also `abs' (complex magnitude), `polarform', `rectform',
     `realpart', and `imagpart'.

     Examples:

          (%i1) carg (1);
          (%o1)                           0
          (%i2) carg (1 + %i);
                                         %pi
          (%o2)                          ---

          (%i3) carg (exp (%i));
          (%o3)                           1
          (%i4) carg (exp (%pi * %i));
          (%o4)                          %pi
          (%i5) carg (exp (3/2 * %pi * %i));
                                          %pi
          (%o5)                         - ---

I uploaded a new patch with minor modifications to Karen's. In particular, it

* removes the duplicate commands that appear in the `EXAMPLES` and `TESTS` blocks for `Function_arg`.
* import `CC` directly instead of calling `ComplexField` in `_evalf_()`.

I give a positive review to Karen's patch. If someone can take a quick look at my changes to check if I didn't mess anything up, this can be merged.

All looks well.  Just a question - do you want to include any of the following as tests?

```

sage: arg(1j)

sage: arg(1J)
