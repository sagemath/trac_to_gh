a test is failing, with _magma_init_(), and I wasn't able to fix it, it seems the _magma_().name() implementation is buggy:

```
File "/usr/local/sage-3.1.2/sage/tmp/ell_point.py", line 1289:
    sage: P._magma_init_()
Expected:
    'EllipticCurve([GF(17)!1,GF(17)!16])![13,4]'
Got:
    '_sage_[2]![_sage_[3],_sage_[4]]'
```

The attached patch seems to do the trick.  It's wrong to use "magma_name" since that just gives somethin like "sage[0]", while "_magma_init_()" return a string which can be passed to a fresh magma session to create the equivalent object.

#4277 is ok now too.
