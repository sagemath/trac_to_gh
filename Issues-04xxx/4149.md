Currently in Sage:

```
sage: is_FractionField(FractionField(ZZ))
False
sage: is_FractionField(QQ)
False
```
These bother me.  Since every field is its own fraction field, this patch makes `is_FractionField` return True when the argument is a field.

I've tried to test this for incompatibilities with other parts of Sage -- I searched for `is_FractionField`, and this led to the change to jack.py. (This change is why mhansen is cc'ed on this, since he wrote jack.py.)  I also ran `sage -testall` after committing the change. Have I missed things?

I would say that none of the is_Something functions should be imported at the top level.  One reason why they're there is to make things easy to refactor / change over time.  If they aren't doing that, then they should probably be removed all together.

I consider both of those situations better than not being able to predict what an is_Something method does.

Additionally, almost every other mathematical property is queried by an .is_* method on the object itself.

My 2 cents:  I agree that is_* functions are not needed at the top level, as people can import them if needed in code, while users can use an object's own .is_*() functions.

The only problem with that is that there will surely be many places where the answer is clear but not currently implemented, such as
sage: ZZ.is_integrally_closed()
NotImplementedError  

This is bound to happen.  There is no algorithm which can be applied to arbitrary rings and determine whether they are integrally closed;  but a lot of special classes are known to be so, and these really should define the relevant functions to return True.

It is allowed for admins in trac and I attempted to grant that right to every logged in user in trac, but the permission model seems to not allow this or I did not read the documentation correctly.
