From _output_from_command_list:

```
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: from sage.interfaces.phc import *  #optional
            sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ,2)    #optional
            sage: start_sys = [(x-1)^2+(y-1)-1, x^2+y^2-1]  #optional
            sage: a = phc._output_from_command_list(['phc -m','4','n','n','n'], start_sys)#optional
            sage: os.unlink(a)#optional
```
The Sage library might not be writable for the user who is running doctests, so the above doctest needs to be fixed.

Cheers,

Michael

Actually, the only files that get used in that function are these:

```
        input_filename = sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename()
        output_filename = sage.misc.misc.tmp_filename()
```

The doctest may have been a little misleading.  The reviewer can decide if the patch should go in or the ticket should be marked as invalid.

Either way is fine with me.  Looking at the code, it seems that mhansen is right.  I'd probably go with the patch so things are less confusing.
