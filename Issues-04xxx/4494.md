This is a problem with the Integer class, not with the matrix class.  The matrix code is:

return self.new_matrix(self.nrows(), self.ncols(), [z.conjugate() for z in self.list()])

The problem is that the Integer class doesn't have a conjugate method.  Should it, or should the integer matrices override this definition?
