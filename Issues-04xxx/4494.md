This is a problem with the Integer class, not with the matrix class.  The matrix code is:

return self.new_matrix(self.nrows(), self.ncols(), [z.conjugate() for z in self.list()])

The problem is that the Integer class doesn't have a conjugate method.  Should it, or should the integer matrices override this definition?

Positive review.  The patch simply supplies the correct solution.  It applies cleanly to 3.2.2.  Tests in sage/matrix and sage/rings all pass.
