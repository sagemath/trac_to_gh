Example:

```
sage: ks3 = kSchurFunctions(QQ,3,1)  # k-Schur functions without a 't' variable
sage: s = SFASchur(base_ring())
sage: ks3(s([3]))

Exception exceptions.TypeError: 'cannot convert a (= 1) to OP' in 'sage.libs.symmetrica.symmetrica._op_schur_general_dict' ignored
function: mult(1) 
python: mult(1): Unknown error 3052408646
```

I don't know if the definition of ks3 above was ever intended to be supported.  I just tried it because I wanted k-Schur functions without a 't' and it seemed the natural thing to do.  Conversions the other way (i.e., s(ks3([3])) ) do seem to work.  And, whether it's intended to be supported or not, segfaults are bad.

Segfaults are bad, so make this a blocker.

Mike: Can you have a look?

Cheers,
