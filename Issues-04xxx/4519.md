There's a problem with the build code that was first introduced by #4377.

The attached patch fixes the trouble. Is there a way to test something like this?

Hmmm,

it seems to me that somewhere I have read that only the lowest 8 bit of "such" return values would be taken into account. I don't remember a reference however, or in what precise context --- bash? posix? ...

But that "256" suddenly becomes "0" would support this faint memory of mine.

Be it as it be, I just tested (with 3.2.rc0) that this patch does indeed fix the problem described (which is there without the patch); and the nature of the patch is local enough one can be pretty sure that nothing else does break.

Positive review from my side.

The only thing I don't agree with is the original classification as "blocker" --- nothing really bad happens, because the old "gen.so" or "gen.dylib" or whatever compiled python extension from the last successful run is still there, and accessed by the wrongly started Sage session. And the error message is displayed prominently enough.

This is definitely a blocker plain and simple since one does not check any large compilation, i.e. a `-ba` for errors. 

Cheers,
