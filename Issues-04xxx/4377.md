exporting MAKE=make -j2 leads to

```

    n = 2*number_of_cpus()
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType'
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```
on OSX 10.4.

This is caused by #3765.

ok, the issue is simple enough and an extra "\n" in the output:

```
>>> import os
>>> os.popen2("sysctl -n hw.ncpu")[1].read()
'2\n'
```
