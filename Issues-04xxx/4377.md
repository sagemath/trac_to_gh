exporting MAKE=make -j2 leads to

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 1545, in <module>
    cython(deps, ext_modules)
  File "setup.py", line 1311, in cython
    execute_list_of_commands(command_list)
  File "setup.py", line 1403, in execute_list_of_commands
    n = 2*number_of_cpus()
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'int' and 'NoneType'
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```
on OSX 10.4.

This is caused by #3765.

Cheers,

Michael
