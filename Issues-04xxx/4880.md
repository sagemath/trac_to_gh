```
Made vtk-5.2 more fashionable:

* moved VTK and VTKData to src/

* test for the installation of cmake-2.4.8 or higher

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/vtk-5.2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/vtk-5.2.spkg)

No changes IN VTK and VTKData

Somebody should look into spkg-install and make it work on OSX.

what is the status of adding spkgs to the repo? Should I wait until we switch before uploading this?

This is taking way to long!

Remember this is experimental!!!!

The spkg only change is spkg-install and SPKG.txt, no changes in src!

In the mean time I have a vtk-5.2.1.spkg

See:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/vtk-5.2.1.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jsp/SPKGS/ETS/vtk-5.2.1.spkg)

Should we close this ticket and open a new one?

Hi Jaap,

> This is taking way to long!

The problem was that due to the transition from modular to the new image spkg uploads were frozen. Now that the new server has stabilized things should be moving again and this ticket has been looking accusingly at me to get moving every time I skim the tickets with positive review :)

> Remember this is experimental!!!!

See above - it has nothing to do with experimental.

> The spkg only change is spkg-install and SPKG.txt, no changes in src!

No, I just changed the summary and will upload this once I get started merging tonight.

Sorry for the delay, it should get better soon and you should have complained more ;)
