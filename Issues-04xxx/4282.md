The current minpoly algorithm on symbolic objects is slow and often fails. This patch makes it work in many more cases, as well as implementing better conversion into QQbar.

There's a problem that comes up testing this, which may be something the improved doctests are exposing rather than causing:

I applied the patch to sage-3.2.1.alpha2. 

1. A doctest fails in calculus.py:

2. This sentence sounds like nonsense:

I think there should be one function the users sees called "minpoly" and it has an algorithm flag.  

 sage: foo.minpoly(algorithm='numerical')
 sage: foo.minpoly()
 sage: foo.minpoly(algorithm='something else clever...')

OK, I believe I've addressed all the points above, and I expanded the documentation a bit more too.

There are several mistakes in English in the new documentation that you added:

* "Note that simplification may be necessary to see the minimal polynomial is correct."  -- missing word "if"

* " If these are known, the numerical algorithm will be faster when these are give them explicitly." -- HUH?

* "use PARI's algdep to get a to get a candidate minpoly $f$." -- delete doubled "to get a".

* "Otherwise raise an error." -- say which exception is raised

* "Note that simplification may be necessary to see the minimal polynomial is correct." -- missing word "if".

**Attachment:** [4282-symbolic-minpoly-referee-fixes.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4282/4282-symbolic-minpoly-referee-fixes.patch)

I made these changes and refreshed the patch. On your first (= last) point, I prefer the word "that" as there is no question of whether or not the result is correct, it just may not be obvious without the right simplification.

I do not like that 'algebraic' and 'numerical' are not parallel constructions -- the parallel construction *WHICH APPEARS IN SOME OF THE DOCTESTS!* is 'algebraic' and 'numeric'.  I have attached a patch which fixes the doctests but doesn't change it to 'numeric'.  The patch does try to help the user -- instead of testing algorithm='numerical' it tests if algorithm starts with 'numeric'.

I like the results and the performance:

With patch:

```
sage: cos(pi/22).minpoly()
x^10 - 11/4*x^8 + 11/4*x^6 - 77/64*x^4 + 55/256*x^2 - 11/1024
sage: cos(pi/56).minpoly()
x^24 - 6*x^22 + 63/4*x^20 - 95/4*x^18 + 5813/256*x^16 - 917/64*x^14 + 3081/512*x^12 - 847/512*x^10 + 9323/32768*x^8 - 459/16384*x^6 + 175/131072*x^4 - 3/131072*x^2 + 1/16777216
```

Without patch:

```
sage: cos(pi/22).minpoly()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Could not prove minimal polynomial x^10 - 11/4*x^8 + 11/4*x^6 - 77/64*x^4 + 55/256*x^2 - 11/1024 (epsilon 3.14321532602626e-100)
sage: cos(pi/56).minpoly()

...
NotImplementedError: Could not prove minimal polynomial x^24 - 6*x^22 + 63/4*x^20 - 95/4*x^18 + 5813/256*x^16 - 917/64*x^14 + 3081/512*x^12 - 847/512*x^10 + 9323/32768*x^8 - 459/16384*x^6 + 175/131072*x^4 - 3/131072*x^2 + 1/16777216 (epsilon 2.29367823690213e-400)
```

With patch:

```
sage: %timeit sqrt(5).minpoly()
100 loops, best of 3: 14.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sqrt(sqrt(5)).minpoly()
10 loops, best of 3: 54 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sqrt(sqrt(5) + sqrt(2)).minpoly()
10 loops, best of 3: 115 ms per loop
```

Without patch:

```
sage: %timeit sqrt(5).minpoly()
10 loops, best of 3: 150 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sqrt(sqrt(5)).minpoly()
10 loops, best of 3: 174 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sqrt(sqrt(5) + sqrt(2)).minpoly()
10 loops, best of 3: 218 ms per loop
```

Note that trac_4282_part2_sqrt-fix.patch went in with quite a bit of offset, so hopefully this is cause by other changes to calculus.py and not a merge snafu:

```
sage-3.2.2.alpha1/devel/sage$ hg import trac_4282_part2_sqrt-fix.patch
applying trac_4282_part2_sqrt-fix.patch
patching file sage/calculus/calculus.py
Hunk #2 succeeded at 8359 with fuzz 1 (offset 386 lines).
```
It builds and doctests pass, so I am confident hg did the right thing.

Cheers,
