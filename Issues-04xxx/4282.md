The current minpoly algorithm on symbolic objects is slow and often fails. This patch makes it work in many more cases, as well as implementing better conversion into QQbar.

There's a problem that comes up testing this, which may be something the improved doctests are exposing rather than causing:

The following tests failed:

2. This sentence sounds like nonsense:

I think there should be one function the users sees called "minpoly" and it has an algorithm flag.  

 sage: foo.minpoly(algorithm='numerical')
 sage: foo.minpoly()
 sage: foo.minpoly(algorithm='something else clever...')

There are several mistakes in English in the new documentation that you added:

* "Note that simplification may be necessary to see the minimal polynomial is correct."  -- missing word "if"

* " If these are known, the numerical algorithm will be faster when these are give them explicitly." -- HUH?

* "Otherwise raise an error." -- say which exception is raised

I do not like that 'algebraic' and 'numerical' are not parallel constructions -- the parallel construction *WHICH APPEARS IN SOME OF THE DOCTESTS!* is 'algebraic' and 'numeric'.  I have attached a patch which fixes the doctests but doesn't change it to 'numeric'.  The patch does try to help the user -- instead of testing algorithm='numerical' it tests if algorithm starts with 'numeric'.

I like the results and the performance:

With patch:

```
sage: cos(pi/22).minpoly()
x^10 - 11/4*x^8 + 11/4*x^6 - 77/64*x^4 + 55/256*x^2 - 11/1024

x^24 - 6*x^22 + 63/4*x^20 - 95/4*x^18 + 5813/256*x^16 - 917/64*x^14 + 3081/512*x^12 - 847/512*x^10 + 9323/32768*x^8 - 459/16384*x^6 + 175/131072*x^4 - 3/131072*x^2 + 1/16777216
```

Without patch:

```

```
