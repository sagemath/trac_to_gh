Most relevant for us are the optimizations, many bugfixes and the ability to use "cimport *" for types.

Spkg and patch look good to me. The is one tiny reviewer patch for the following failure:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py             
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.rc0/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 262:
    sage: g._next_var_name()
Expected:
    '$sage5'
Got:
    '$sage3'
**********************************************************************
```

Cheers,

Michael
