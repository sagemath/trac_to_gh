I know there are still problems.  But all doctests currently pass, I don't know of remaining bugs, and I wanted to keep this manageable (rather than continuing the tradition of patch-bombs).  I'm going to keep working on adding more documentation.

I'll be honest, this is ugly beyond belief.

Why isn't this printing functionality factored out into a separate printing object which is then part of the data for the ring?  For example, we now have a boatload of printing parameters... sounds like an object to me.  We have, for example, a `name` and a `ram_name`; for something like `Zq(5^2, 'a')` `name` is 'a' and one could make 5 print as `ram_name`, often 'p'.  But what happens when we have two level extensions, rather than just one level?

Why aren't we constructing `Zp` first, setting its printing, and then constructing `Zq` on top of that `Zp`?

I am reviewing this positive because:

* it passes doctests;
* it appears to fix at least one of the bugs at hand;
* it adds valuable documentation and tests;
* and, most importantly, is a step in the direction the maintainer, David Roe, wants the code to progress.
