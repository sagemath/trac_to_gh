I'll be honest, this is ugly beyond belief.

Why isn't this printing functionality factored out into a separate printing object which is then part of the data for the ring?  For example, we now have a boatload of printing parameters... sounds like an object to me.  We have, for example, a `name` and a `ram_name`; for something like `Zq(5^2, 'a')` `name` is 'a' and one could make 5 print as `ram_name`, often 'p'.  But what happens when we have two level extensions, rather than just one level?

Why aren't we constructing `Zp` first, setting its printing, and then constructing `Zq` on top of that `Zp`?

I am reviewing this positive because:

* it passes doctests;
* it appears to fix at least one of the bugs at hand;
* it adds valuable documentation and tests;
* and, most importantly, is a step in the direction the maintainer, David Roe, wants the code to progress.

REMARK: 

This patch introduces 5 new functions with no doctests, hence fails what I consider *the most basic* review criterion:

```
	360	    def _sep(self): 
 	361	        return self.sep 
 	362	 
 	363	    def _alphabet(self):

 	365	 
 	366	    def _max_ram_terms(self): 
 	367	        return self.max_ram_terms 
 	368	 
 	369	    def _max_unram_terms(self): 
 	370	        return self.max_unram_terms
