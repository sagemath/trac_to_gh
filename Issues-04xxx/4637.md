I know there are still problems.  But all doctests currently pass, I don't know of remaining bugs, and I wanted to keep this manageable (rather than continuing the tradition of patch-bombs).  I'm going to keep working on adding more documentation.

I'll be honest, this is ugly beyond belief.

Why isn't this printing functionality factored out into a separate printing object which is then part of the data for the ring?  For example, we now have a boatload of printing parameters... sounds like an object to me.  We have, for example, a `name` and a `ram_name`; for something like `Zq(5^2, 'a')` `name` is 'a' and one could make 5 print as `ram_name`, often 'p'.  But what happens when we have two level extensions, rather than just one level?

Why aren't we constructing `Zp` first, setting its printing, and then constructing `Zq` on top of that `Zp`?

I am reviewing this positive because:

* it passes doctests;
* it appears to fix at least one of the bugs at hand;
* it adds valuable documentation and tests;
* and, most importantly, is a step in the direction the maintainer, David Roe, wants the code to progress.

Fair criticisms.  The current model of passing in parameters hasn't really stood up well as I've added features.  Now that someone else has read the code, I'd be happy to discuss better options.
