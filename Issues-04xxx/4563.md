This does not work:

```
sage: polar_plot(x, (x, 0, 1))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jason/<ipython console> in <module>()

TypeError: polar_plot() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)
```

But this does:

```
sage: polar_plot(x,0, 1)
```
