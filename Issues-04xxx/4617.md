This is related with ticket #4587

For doc-testing the installation of packages, there should be some `test-dummy.spkg`

The purpose of the package is to do *nothing*. William suggested to mark it `optional -- admin`, I am not sure what that means. [it means that it would only be tested when we do sage -t -only_optional=admin, where admin means "tested by the admin who has write privileges to the sage install]

Also, there should be an easy way to get rid of `test-dummy.spkg` after installation.

Idea:
* `sage -i test-dummy.spkg` should simply result in an entry in the list of installed packages.
* uninstalling it is done by removing the list entry and deleting the file `test-dummy.spkg`.

... which probably also requires admin privileges. So, the to-be-created doctests for #4587 will also be optional -- admin, right?
