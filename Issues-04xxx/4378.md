-sdist needs to copy the new html files in the template directory. Otherwise Sage does not start up and all the tests fail on "make check"

These html files need to be added to MANIFEST.in

dist/sage-3.2.alpha2/spkg/standard/sage-3.2.alpha2$ hg stat
dist/sage-3.2.alpha2/spkg/standard/sage-3.2.alpha2$ 
```
