Getting the change of basis matrix for Jordan forms fails if there are multiple blocks with the same eigenvalue, e.g.:

```
m = matrix(QQ,[[0,1,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]])
m.jordan_form(base_ring=QQ, transformation=True) 
```
gives 

```
ValueError: cannot compute the basis of the Jordan block of size 2 with eigenvalue 0
```
This was reported on sage-support by Rob Beezer, subject line is: "Transformation to Jordan form for tame 6x6 integer matrix".

Seems to work very well.  I tested it on some tough random cases of size 12x12 to 30x30 and it seems correct, and reasonably fast.  Nice work.
