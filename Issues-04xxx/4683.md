sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
```
memory consumption increases about 70Mb which each command (at least on my machine),
this does not happen if one writes

```
sage: v = [CDF(i^2.) for n in range(50000)]
```
, however, results are the same,

#4639 fixes the vast majority of the problem here, but:

```
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
421.88671875
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.140625
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.15234375
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.40625
```
So still some small leak to go. I will poke around post 3.2.2.

Cheers,

Michael

I don't see any growth in memory usage anymore either. I guess we can safely close it.
