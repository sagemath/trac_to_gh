Using sage 3.2 (compiled from sources) on a 32-bit Core Duo machine running Debian Etch,
when performing

```

----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 3.2, Release Date: 2008-11-20                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
```
memory consumption increases about 70Mb which each command (at least on my machine),
this does not happen if one writes

```
sage: v = [CDF(i^2.) for n in range(50000)]
```
, however, results are the same,

#4639 fixes the vast majority of the problem here, but:

```
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
421.88671875
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.140625
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.15234375
sage: v = [CDF(i)^2 for n in range(50000)]
sage: get_memory_usage()
422.40625
```
So still some small leak to go. I will poke around post 3.2.2.

Cheers,

Michael
