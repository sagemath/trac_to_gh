Attachment: **[mpolynomial_zz_reduce_doc.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4021/mpolynomial_zz_reduce_doc.patch.gz)**

The second patch addresses the review of Oliver Wienand on [sage-devel]:

```
I have just glimpsed over the code. But maybe it is worth stating in
the comments, that the reduce impl. only returns unqiue answer against
strong Gröbner basis.

Gröbner basis G of I <=> the leading ideal of G generates all leading
terms of I
strong % of I <=> for every leading term t of I there exists an
element g of G, such that the leading term of g divides t.

(leading terms meaans coef * product of variables)

Otherwise the reduce code shown in
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4021/mpolynomial_libsingular_zz.patch.gz
looks fine.
```

Attachment: **[trac4021-doctest-fix.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4021/trac4021-doctest-fix.patch.gz)**

Applies cleanly on 3.1.3.alpha1 + the patch at #686, except for a reject in rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx, which can be ignored.

There is a tiny doctest failure in rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py which is fixed by the attached patch.
