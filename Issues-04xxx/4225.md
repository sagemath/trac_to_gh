Looks good to me.

For some reason I had some trouble applying the patch to my 3.1.3.alpha2, but I think that might be something messed up on my end.  I applied the patch manually and it works.

Attachment: **[4225-complex-sqrt.2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4225/4225-complex-sqrt.2.patch.gz)**

OK, I've uploaded a version rebased against 3.1.3.alpha2.

For the record, here is some timing info:

before the patch:

```
sage: C = ComplexField()
sage: z = C(1+i)
sage: timeit("z.sqrt()")
625 loops, best of 3: 8.57 µs per loop
sage: C = ComplexField(10000)
sage: z = C(1+i)
sage: timeit("z.sqrt()")
125 loops, best of 3: 6.95 ms per loop
```

after the patch:

```
sage: C = ComplexField()
sage: z = C(1+i)
sage: timeit("z.sqrt()")
625 loops, best of 3: 2.27 µs per loop
sage: C = ComplexField(10000)
sage: z = C(1+i)
sage: timeit("z.sqrt()")
625 loops, best of 3: 509 µs per loop
```
