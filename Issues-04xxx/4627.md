Hi William,

The attached patch prevents recomputing a CRT a number of times when doing a
multi modular Hermite normal form.  I was finding that this CRT computation
was taking *much* longer than the rest of the calculation of a midsize HNF
(40 x 40).  Has this been addressed?

No.

 Should this be run by Clement and some
randomized testing?

Yes, definitely.   I've cc'd Clement and included the attachment.

So this code looks fine to me, but I can't find any cases where it makes a significant change in runtime. For instance, taking a random 40x40 matrix over ZZ, the runtimes are the same before and after the patch. 

Nick, what is a good test case to see the performance improvement?

Looks good! Nick pointed out a nice example of a test case:

BEFORE:

```
sage: y = polygen(ZZ)
sage: M.<a> = NumberField(y^20 - 2*y^19 + 10*y^17 - 15*y^16 + 40*y^14 - 64*y^13 + 46*y^12 + 8*y^11 - 32*y^10 + 8*y^9 + 46*y^8 - 64*y^7 + 40*y^6 - 15*y^4 + 10*y^3 - 2*y + 1)
sage: time M.ideal(prod(prime_range(6000,6200))).free_module()
CPU times: user 33.71 s, sys: 2.02 s, total: 35.73 s
Wall time: 36.06 s

Free module of degree 20 and rank 20 over Integer Ring
User basis matrix:
20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field
```

AFTER:

```
sage: y = polygen(ZZ)
sage: M.<a> = NumberField(y^20 - 2*y^19 + 10*y^17 - 15*y^16 + 40*y^14 - 64*y^13 + 46*y^12 + 8*y^11 - 32*y^10 + 8*y^9 + 46*y^8 - 64*y^7 + 40*y^6 - 15*y^4 + 10*y^3 - 2*y + 1)
sage: time M.ideal(prod(prime_range(6000,6200))).free_module()
CPU times: user 0.65 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 0.70 s
Wall time: 0.70 s

Free module of degree 20 and rank 20 over Integer Ring
User basis matrix:
20 x 20 dense matrix over Rational Field
```

Speedup of 50X -- not too shabby! In particular, it seems to apply when you have really large coefficients compared to the size of the matrix. (This seems reasonable, given that for small entries, the CRT simply doesn't get applied that many times, since one has a bound on the size of the output.)

I added another doctest (which really needs compared between versions with `%timeit`), and committed the patch in Nick's name.
