I am no longer seeing this with the system compiler in 3.3.alpha6, but will try with gcc 4.3.3.

This issue does no longer happen with the system gcc as well as gcc 4.3.3 with Sage 3.3.alpha6:

```
mabshoff@menas:~/build-3.3.alpha6/sage-3.3.alpha6-menas-gcc433> ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/misc/randstate.pyx
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/misc/randstate.pyx"
