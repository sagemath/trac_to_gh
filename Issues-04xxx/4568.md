```
The doc test of `save_session` does the following:

```
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: a = 5
            sage: save_session('session')
        
        ...
        Clean up the session file we just wrote to disk.
            sage: os.unlink('session.sobj')
```

Hence, if the user happens to have a file `session.sobj` in the current directory then running the doc test would destroy it.

According to a suggestion of Robert Bradshow, using the `tempfile` Python module might help.

Unfortunately I have no idea in what file `save_session` is defined - so, no patch at that point...

Hi Simon,

My concern with the current wording is that it's not entirely clear that the user should NOT save the session to a file in SAGE_TMP.  We only do that for doctesting purposes.

Hi Mike, 

Good point! I changed my patch accordingly - in the new patch I clearly say that for permanent saving SAGE_TMP would be a bad idea.
