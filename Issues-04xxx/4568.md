```
The doc test of `save_session` does the following:

```
        EXAMPLES:
            sage: a = 5
            sage: save_session('session')
        
        ...
        Clean up the session file we just wrote to disk.
            sage: os.unlink('session.sobj')
```

Hence, if the user happens to have a file `session.sobj` in the current directory then running the doc test would destroy it.

According to a suggestion of Robert Bradshow, using the `tempfile` Python module might help.

Unfortunately I have no idea in what file `save_session` is defined - so, no patch at that point...

Keywords: **save_session temporary file**

Component: **doctest coverage**

Meanwhile I found out that `save_session` is in `sage/misc/session.pyx`. Hence, I produced a patch that modifies three doc tests that had the above dangerous behaviour.

Hi Simon,

My concern with the current wording is that it's not entirely clear that the user should NOT save the session to a file in SAGE_TMP.  We only do that for doctesting purposes.

Hi Mike, 

Good point! I changed my patch accordingly - in the new patch I clearly say that for permanent saving SAGE_TMP would be a bad idea.
