This was reported by M. Yurko in an email to sage-support:

here are some examples of what I did:
#First, an example of the bug

```
Ei(20)
Output: 25615646.4145 + 6.28318530718*I 
```
it should instead be just 25615646.4145

```
Ei(19)
Output: 9950907.25105 
```
the error doesn't occur here

```
-exponential_integral_1(-20).n(digits=50)
Output: 25615652.664056588 
```
here the bug doesn't occur, although the
code for exponential_integral_1  loses a lot 
of accuracy by converting the number returned 
from PARI into a float, so it has much less
accuracy

```
-pari(-20).eint1().n(digits = 50)
Output: 2.5615652664056588773746625520288944244384765625000e7 }}}
here the full accuracy from PARI is preserved
the following shows the difference in the speed 
of the two methods 

the current implementation
{{{
%time
for i in srange (1,10^6):
   num = Ei(10)
Output: CPU time: 51.64 s,  Wall time: 51.81 s
}}}
the time of PARI's implementation
{{{
%time
for i in srange (1,10^6):
   num = pari(-i).eint1()
Output: CPU time: 20.12 s,  Wall time: 20.32 s
}}}
PARI's implementation seems to be more than twice as fast

William Stein added this:

A quick remark: The Pari Ei only works with *real* input, whereas the scipy one works with complex input.
The Sage function will have to fixed in the meantime or
at least as a bare minimum have a big comment at the top explaining that there is a bug.

Sorry for the delay: you're right, this seems to fix the problem, at
least for me. The example now gives me:

(25615628.4058-3.14159265359j)

Mike Hansen observes that one could implement Ei in *general* and with arbitrary precision by using the library "mpmath", which just happens to already be in Sage.  That library can be made fast if we included gmpy or hack it to use our integers.

```
sage: import sympy.mpmath as a
sage: a.ei(complex(2r,3r))
mpc(real='-0.3615519445996403', imag='5.2705484358136943')
sage: a.mp.prec = 1000
sage: a.ei('20.1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000')

The exponential integral implementation in mpmath was recently improved to work for large arguments too:

```
>>> mp.dps = 50
>>> ei(mpc(10**30, 10**40))
mpc(real='-2.2944454721211223524123643204705731535186663746073664e+4342944819032

+434294481903251827651128918876')
```

However, it is not optimized at all at the moment, and is probably many times slower than PARI. ei in mpmath is about 4-8 times slower than the cosine integral ci (which is almost the same function as ei, so properly optimized they should be about equally fast). [mpmath.ci(x) for x in range(10**6)] takes 132 seconds on my laptop.

If I find the time, I'll try to both optimize and assure accuracy everywhere for all the incarnations of exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic integrals in mpmath for the next version.

I posted a new patch with a few changes to the original patch.  I'm using mpmath for everything since for uniformity and because it handles the increased precision.  Also, I changed the second example to highlight the branch cut and added the failing example in the ticket as a test.

Michael, if you're okay with my changes, then you can mark the patch as positive review.  I left the patch in your name.

Your patch looks good. On second thought, it probably is better to just use mpmath since is_RealNumber doesn't really do what I had originally thought. That and mpmath only seems to be getting faster.
