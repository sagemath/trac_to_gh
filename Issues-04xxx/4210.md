#4205 depends on the new scipy-0.7svn.spkg and some other tickets which will not go into Sage 3.1.3. To still be able to update to numpy 1.2 we need to quiet some deprecation warnings in numpy itself for now. The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.3/alpha2/numpy-1.2.0.p0.spkg

introduces a couple work arounds for now that should be reverted once #3391, #3498 and #4005 go in.

Cheers,

Michael
