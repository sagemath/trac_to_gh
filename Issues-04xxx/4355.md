The latex method for tableaux was written in a rush during Sage Days 7
to get the latex output for crystals. This is a partial quick port of
the TeX method we use in MuPAD-Combinat in the general case of
"ObjectsWith2DBoxedRepresentation" which includes everything from
partitions, tableaux, skew tableaux, ribbons tableaux, to rigged
configurations, or other things that can be drawn with symbols in an
array, and some horizontal and vertical delimiters, like mazes. 

A class which inherits from ObjectsWith2DBoxedRepresentation just has
to implement a method that fills appropriately an array for the
symbols, and another for the delimiters, and it gets for free 2D ascii
art, latex, ... output.  See:

http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/doc/en/Cat_Combinat/CombinatorialClassWith2DBoxedRepresentation.html

http://sourceforge.net/p/mupad-combinat/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/MuPAD-Combinat/lib/DOMAINS/CATEGORY/CombinatorialClassWith2DBoxedRepresentation.mu

For a few samples of the produced 2d ascii art, you can have a look
at:

http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/doc/en/output_Combinat/asciiArt.html

(note: the pictures are broken unless you use a fixed font).

It as proven to be a handy tool, for the zillion of tableaux-like
classes, so a good candidate for porting.

First straightforward step: LaTeX output (partitions and cores in ticket #12314)

Second step: same as above, but making sure the produced LaTeX is compatible with jsmath/mathjax, for display in the notebook.

Third step: ascii art output. This may require a bit more thinking,
since there is not yet (?) a general framework for ascii art in Sage.
