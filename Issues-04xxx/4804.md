This could look better:

```
sage: latex(ceil(x) + floor(x) + derivative(floor(x)))
{{d}\over{d\,x}}\,\left \lfloor x \right \rfloor + \text{floor} \left( x \right) + \text{ceil} \left( x \right)
```

Notice that floor and ceil do not have special latex support except strangely inside the derivative. Also, the derivative would be better written as a partial derivative, since that's what it is in Sage in general. 

Also, this guy wrote to sage-support 3 or 4 times about this and was ignored:

```
Dear all,

I tried to reply my questions below to an existing thread (notation
for derivatives) but for some reason it didn't work. So I opened this
new one.

I use the derivative function and want to get an output in latex
style. At the moment the output looks quite good but imho it would be
nicer if it uses the "\partial" latex command. It is possible to
implement this? Further I use the floor and ceil functions. Would it
be possible to implement a latex output for these functions too?

Thanks,
Andreas

I don't agree with the positive review, since the change breaks the latex output for
maxima expressions:

```
sage: m = maxima('d/(d-2)')
sage: latex(m)
{{\partial}\over{d-2}}
```

Cheers,

Wilfried

It is still not correct:

```
sage: m = maxima('2*diff(f(x), x)')
sage: latex(m)
2\,\left({{d}\over{d\,x}}\,f\left(x\right)\right)
```

This should be changed in the maxima code, there
it should be trivial. Trying to guess what part
of the latex representation is a differential
seems very error prone to me.

Wilfried
