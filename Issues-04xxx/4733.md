(It is based on the facts that exp(A) commutes with A

I think I see what you were saying:

sage: Bprime.nrows()

[-4.26325641456060e-14  2.84217094304040e-14]
```

Everything is all right, though.  "==" returning false just means that Sage can't prove that they are equal.  Let's simplify instead:

```
sage: (B(1)*A - A*B(1)).apply_map(lambda e: e.full_simplify())

[0 0]
[0 0]
sage: (B(1)*A - Bprime(1)).apply_map(lambda e: e.full_simplify())

[0 0]
[0 0]
```

Does that ease your mind?  Can you review this patch now?
