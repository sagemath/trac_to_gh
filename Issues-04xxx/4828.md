There are two issues: 

* In sage/sage/combinat/ranker.py "Thi√©ry" is used without the proper encoding, so change it to "Thiery" since that is consistent with the other spellings
* in doc/ref/files we still include the old word.tex file which no longer exists, so delete that line. The new words documentation will be in 3.3.

Cheers,

Michael
