**Attachment:** [4537-inversemod.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4537/4537-inversemod.patch)

I've uploaded a patch. Should work under 3.2.rc1 with the patch for #4536 installed (as it uses the coordinates() method of orders). 

I've implemented quadratic fields and general absolute fields; it would be trivial to implement for relative orders too, but there is so much general brokenness for relative orders that there doesn't seem much point (we don't even have is_integral() for relative orders yet).

REFEREE REPORT:

Positive review, since this is a very nice patch.  I agree with John that it would be nice to have something more general, but that can be for another patch later. 

This is very nice.  Good to go.
