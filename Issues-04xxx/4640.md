If we are going to update the pickle jar for 3.2.2 we might as well fix this.

I am seeing two doctest failures, one which could have been caused by my dumb rebase attempt:

```

sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py # 1 doctests failed
```
In detail: This might be caused by missing pickles in the pickle jar:
