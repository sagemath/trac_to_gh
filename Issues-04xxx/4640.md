[7:17pm] ws-3621: mabshoff -- sure, we could.
[7:18pm] ws-3621: I don't see why not.
[7:18pm] ws-3621: good idea.

I am seeing two doctest failures, one which could have been caused by my dumb rebase attempt:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 1 doctests 
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py # 1 doctests failed
```
In detail: This might be caused by missing pickles in the pickle jar:
