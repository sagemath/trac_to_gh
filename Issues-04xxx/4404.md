As requested by Stan Flavia on sage-support, replace the single "Download to a file" menu option in the notebook by two options:
* Download to a file
* Download to a file w/ history

The first would download a version of the file without the revision history.  The second would do what the current "Download to a file" command does.

One should also discuss the possibility of an option to download *just* the worksheet.txt, for those accessing Sage only via their browser.

SageNB no longer exports revision data, so I think this should be closed.
