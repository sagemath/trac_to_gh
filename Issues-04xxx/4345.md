There are several places in Sage where one often has to specify variable names; it would be nice to have a uniform system in place for having defaults. For instance, these behaviors: 

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: F = NumberField(x^3-2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: You must specify the name of the generator.

sage: CuspForms(23,2).newforms()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Please specify a name to be used when generating names for generators of Hecke eigenvalue fields corresponding to the newforms.

```

can be annoying at times, especially for new users. 

A good model for the system might be the system-wide proof flags, for instance.
