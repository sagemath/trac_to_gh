Patch coming up: We need to add 

```
## We want the debug and optimization flags, since debug symbols are so useful, etc.
env.Append( CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
env.Append( CXXFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64" )
env.Append( LINKFLAGS="-m64 -single_module -flat_namespace -undefined dynamic_lookup" )
```
in case we are building in 64 bit mode on OSX.

Cheers,
