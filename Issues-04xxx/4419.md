```
The following fails 

```
sage: p = gap(Permutation('(1,2,3)'))
sage: q = gap(Permutation([()]))
sage: gap.Group([p, q])
```
because 

```
sage: gap(Permutation((1,2,3)))
[ 2 3 1 ]
```

Attachment: **[trac_4419.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4419/trac_4419.patch.gz)**

I don't see how this fixes the original problem. I get this:

```
sage: p = gap(Permutation('(1,2,3)'))                                                                                              
sage: q = gap(Permutation('()'))                                                                                       
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                            
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>


ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
```

and this:

```
sage: q = gap(Permutation(()))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<snip>

TypeError: not enough arguments for format string
```

It seems to me you want Permutation to work like
PermutationGroupElement does here:

```
sage: p = gap(PermutationGroupElement('(1,2,3)'))
sage: q = gap(PermutationGroupElement('()'))
sage: gap.Group([p, q])
Group( [ (1,2,3), () ] )
sage: gap.Group([p]) == gap.Group([p, q])
True
```
Is that correct?

Actually, the original issue was this:

```
sage: p = gap(Permutation('(1,2,3)'))
sage: q = gap(Permutation([()]))
sage: gap.Group([p, q])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
```

Those things that you encountered are "bugs" in the constructor of Permutation.  I always construct Permutations from their list notation.

This patch should get a positive review because it fixes the conversion to gap problem:

```
sage: p = Permutation('(1,2,3)')
sage: q = Permutation([()])
sage: gap.Group([p,q])
Group( [ (1,2,3), () ] )
```

The other issues noticed by wdj are problems with the Permutations constructor function, and I will open a new ticket for them.
