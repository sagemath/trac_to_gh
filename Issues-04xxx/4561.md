You're right Robert, and that definition of _fast_float_ for sin and cos
is totally the wrong approach.  E.g., observe that your _fast_float_ sin
is twice as fast as math.sin:

sage: a = sin._fast_float_()
sage: timeit('a(3.4r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 469 ns per loop
sage: a = sin(x)._fast_float_()
sage: timeit('a(3.4r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 254 ns per loop

Note that the code in calculus.py is *not* just returning math.sin,
actually, but constructing a fast_float object, which is actually
way *WORSE* than math.sin, even:

sage: a = sin._fast_float_()
sage: timeit('a(3.4r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 809 ns per loop
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.ext.fast_eval.FastDoubleFunc'>
