Hi John,

this one was a really strange doctest failure and I am glad you fixed it.

One thing I noticed while looking at the file was that you use constructs like

```
sage: B = SteenrodAlgebra(2, 'adem')
```
which seem very un-Sagish, i.e. one would use some (optional) keyword in the constructor like

```
sage: B = SteenrodAlgebra(2, foo=adem)
```
This certainly should not addressed via this ticket, but might be something that should be discussed on [sage-devel].

Cheers,

Michael

PS: I will test and review this patch shortly.

```
SteenrodAlgebra(5, 'adem')
```
could be changed to

```
SteenrodAlgebra(5, basis='adem')
```
(These both work right now; it would just be a matter of changing the documentation to reflect the preferred choice, if the second choice is better.)  I don't know how to implement something like

SteenrodAlgebra(5, basis=adem)
```
though, without importing `adem` into the global name space.

That sounds good to me. I would also prefer "foo" and not 'foo' for strings, but that is probably personal preference.
