Review (from reading the html output):

Schemes section

* base_extend(): missing newline before EXAMPLES
* projective_embedding(): bad indentation for second INPUT block
* affine_patch() has a comma at the start of a line
* projective_embedding(): bad indentation for second INPUT block (again)

Elliptic and Plane Curves section

* typo in arithmetic_genus():  "normalization"
* division_polynomial(): bad indentation in the (rather long) explanation of input parameter two_torsion_multiplicity; some math-mode missing here too.

[I noticed that the functions are sorted into alphabetical order, with upper case before lower case.  Can we make it case-insensitive?  For example, S_integral_points() comes right near the top.]

* typo in heegner_index: "currently"
* modular_degree(): in one place algorithm 'ec' is mentioned instead of 'sympow'.
* regulator_of_points: bad indentation of INPUT
* tamagawa_exponent(): bad math translation of $C_2\times C_2$.
* group_law (in formal_group):  missing subscript tage on t1, t2;  bad exponent "prec". same in mult_by_n() and possibly elsewhere.
* frobenius_expansion_by_series(): the 2nd and 3rd large displays are merged.  I think "where" should be on a separate line in between.
* "p-adic functions from ell_rational_field.py, moved here to reduce" is a sill name.  I suggest renameing to simply "p-adic functions", perhaps with "miscellaneous".

Hyperelliptic curve section:

* At bottom of section "Conductor and Reduction Types for Genus 2 Curves": the reference to the paper of Liu looks all wrong.

I forgot to say:  patch applies ok to 3.2.3.final.  I have not tried editing the source to fix the things I found, since I don't know how to check the result.
