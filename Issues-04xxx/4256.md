The ambient_dim function overwrites the content self._dim thus making dim() return a wrong answer:

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,0,1]])
sage: p.dim()
0
sage: p.ambiant_dim()
3
sage: p.dim()
3
```

In the vertex_adjacency_matrix() docstring, maybe you should use 'binary' rather than '0/1'

In render_solid(), since you now have ambient_dim(), why not use it?  It could replace the ugly test I put there.

Also for the 'special' polyhedron creation methods, it could be good to reuse the approach taken for graphs, where you have the Graph class and an instance of a special class called graphs where you have building methods for most interesting types of graphs.

The first item is a must-fix, the other three would be nice, but are not stricly essential.
