The patch `trac_4196.2.patch` is a rebase against Sage 4.0.2. It turns out that the cause of the failure was line 248 in the first patch. So the only difference between `trac_4196.patch` and `trac_4196.2.patch` is that in `trac_4196.2.patch` I left out line 248 in the original patch. Apart from the rebase, positive review.
