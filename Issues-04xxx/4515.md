**Attachment:** [makefile.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4515/makefile.gz)

This ticket includes three files.  sage-4515-sage_c_bug.patch fixes a bug in the sage-sage script where `sage -c "..."` didn't correctly run the sage_setup function in sage-sage.   The second file sage-4515-sage_starts.patch adds a sage-starts script, that verifies that ones sage actually starts up.  The third file `makefile` replaces the makefile in SAGE_ROOT by a new one that runs sage-starts before running any of the make check targets. 

To test this patch, take any sage install, edit the file SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/sage-current-location.txt and put some random crap in there.  Then do 

```
sage -c "2+2"
```
and see that the current location stuff gets updated.  Corrupt sage-current-location.txgt again, then do

```
make check  # or any other target
```
and verify that the location stuff gets updated.

Note: In the list of the options of Sage that is displayed by "sage --advanced", the explanation for "sage -tp ..." (presumably "parallel" testing) is missing.

(I found this out because this patch changes in the makefile some calls "sage -tp 8 ..." into "sage -tp 12 ..." and was curious what this means --- presumably the number of threads to be started.)

Note: "make testoptional" adds the option "-optional" and creates a logfile "testall.log".

"make ptestall" (new with this patch) also adds the option "-optional", and creates a logfile "ptest.log", possibly overwriting a file with the same name generated by a previous run of "make ptest".

All this naming is pretty inconsistent, but would not stand in the way of a possible positive review.

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
Applying the "sage_start" script patch vanilla as is, copying the new makefile over, corrupting the file "sage-current-location.txt" and doing "make testlong" does not run very long:

```
. local/bin/sage-env && sage-starts && ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage 2>&1 | tee -a testlong.log
/bin/sh: line 1: /Users/georgweber/Public/sage/sage-3.2.rc0/local/bin/sage-starts: Permission denied
make: *** [testlong] Error 126
```
Obviously a "chmod a+x sage-starts" in local/bin is needed. I do not know however if this is an issue which could be healed by a somehow "corrected" version of the patch, or if it is a mercurial nuisance.
