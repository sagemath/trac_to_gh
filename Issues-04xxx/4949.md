Should `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` default to `SAGE_TMPDIR`?

(We have btw. lots of - in some cases not very well-named - environment variables.)

Making use of e.g. a RAM disk (or some user-provided directory) for doctesting is also worth doing.

Wouldn't it be sufficient to just (keep the -- perhaps slightly modified -- documentation and the three lines honoring `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS` and) change the variable `BUILD` (bad name btw.) in `sage-env` if `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` is set?

That way this ticket would hardly collide with #11021, which fixes a lot in `sage-spkg` (and a bug in `sage-env` w.r.t. `BUILD`), also using `$BUILD` consistently there.

I also would use `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` "directly", without creating yet another subdirectory (`build`) in it; the spkgs are extracted into their own directories anyway.

- the single largest subdirectory of "build" can be up to 1165M (building eclib on the skynet machines iras and cleo, ia64 processors).  On all of the other machines, it took at most 880M.  On sage.math, cicero, and my mac, the largest took 320M.

- the total amount of disk space, if you keep all of the subdirectories can be as large as 5.3G (iras and cleo again) or as small as 2.2G (hawk).

I've put in conservative estimates for these in the documentation.

The usage of `$` is a bit inconsistent: <code>:file:\`$SAGE_ROOT/...\`</code> vs. <code>:file:\`SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/...\`</code>.

I would add a warning that `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` must not contain spaces, and should be an absolute path (starting with a slash or whatever). Note that none of this is checked in `sage-spkg`; also, a broken `test` might return `true` for an empty string, so I would also `test -n "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR"`.

Also, if `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` is set but the directory does not exist, no warning or error message is printed.




> I built Sage on various machines [...] and found that [...]
> I've put in conservative estimates for these in the documentation.

The actual space required or used does hardly depend on the platform, but the file system characteristics, i.e. the block size.

The worst case space usage is theoretically unlimited when taking into account rebuilds and (re)installations of newer packages, as old build dirs are moved to the `$BUILD/old/` directory if `-s` was specified or `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes`.

(Btw., for some reason the build dirs of the base packages never get deleted. Perhaps that's a side-effect of the "`BUILD` bug", haven't tracked this down.)

I would mention the relationship to the `-s` parameter when installing packages with `sage`; the main reason for the additional environment variable is that there's no other way to achieve what `-s` does when using `make`.

Right, but the documentation as written is accurate ("After a full build of Sage...") and I think is good enough.  Anyone who sets this variable should be paying attention to the build directory anyway.

> (Btw., for some reason the build dirs of the base packages never get deleted. Perhaps that's a side-effect of the "BUILD bug", haven't tracked this down.)

`prereq` and `bzip` are not installed by sage-spkg but by their own install scripts (`prereq-0.9-install` and `bzip2-1.0.5-install`), which create subdirectories of `build` but don't delete them when they're done.

Adding a comment about the relationship to the `-s` option is a good idea.  I'll try to add some tests for `SAGE_BUILD_TEMPDIR`, too.

There's a `$` missing in

```
:file:`$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build` or :file:`SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/build`
```

I would clarify that `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes` affects *all* spkg installations (whether with `./sage [-i|-f]` or `make`, the latter also when *re*building [parts of] Sage), and that the build directory (within the Sage tree or in `$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/`) will definitely grow over time, i.e., whenever new packages get installed or already existing / built packages reinstalled, unless one unsets `SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS` at some point (which of course doesn't delete existing subdirectories in the first place).




Your observations regarding the build tree sizes on skynet are interesting; there IMHO shouldn't be such a large difference, at least not when doing "the same thing".

There are differences in object code size between RISC and CISC architectures (on the former usually larger, but *at most* by a factor of 2 I think) and between 32-bit and 64-bit (mostly on RISC architectures, and also if there's a lot of static data involving e.g. pointers or integers of different size); other differences might be due to debug symbols and *how and what* we build (e.g. assembly implementations, static or dynamic libraries in addition) on a specific platform.

I would mention the effect of the block size of the file system though (as a note perhaps), since many packages consist of a large number of small files.

Done

I've added some explanation.  It doesn't grow quite as fast as it might, since pre-existing subdirectories are moved to SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/old/, *overwriting* copies that were already there.  So just reinstalling Sage over and over again will just use twice as much as space as doing it once.  Upgrading will then take up more space.

> Your observations regarding the build tree sizes on skynet are interesting; there IMHO shouldn't be such a large difference, at least not when doing "the same thing".

"eclib" is the usual culprit.  There are huge differences in the amount of disk space it uses, so on some systems it is by far the largest, and on others, it isn't.  On the skynet machines, "moin" uses a consistent 320 megabytes, whereas eclib ranges from something under that to over 1 gig, depending on the OS and the processor.

> I would mention the effect of the block size of the file system though (as a note perhaps), since many packages consist of a large number of small files.

Done.

Yep.

Hope you don't mind me temporarily moving this to "sage-pending"; I intend to finish #11021 and rebase the patch(es) here on that, the latter presumably much easier than the other way around.

I don't see a reason for it, it was there before.  Should I create a new patch which removes it?  I think that would fix one or two of the issues from #11021.

> Also, why introduce a new variable `$BUILD_DIR` instead of using `$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR`?

The code says, roughly

```
if $SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR is not empty and points to an existing directory:
    BUILD_DIR=$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR
else
    BUILD_DIR=$SAGE_PACKAGES
fi

build Sage in $BUILD_DIR
```

Something else: do we really want to build in

```
$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/build/atlas-3.8.4.p1/
```

I would find it more natural to build in

```
$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/atlas-3.8.4.p1/
```

And therefore, let $SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR by default be equal to

```
$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build/
```

And perhaps drop the requirement for `$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR` to be an existing directory: just create it if needed.

(This is just an idea: I don't have strong feelings about this)

If you run "sage -i blah"  and "blah" is an optional spkg which needs to be downloaded, would it make more sense to save the spkg in $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional/ or in $SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/optional?

Here's a new patch.  I've removed the variables "BUILD" and "BUILD_DIR", and I've appended "build" to the setting of "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR".

It feels cleaner to me: if I set `$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR=/tmp`, then rather than producing many subdirectories of `tmp`, everything will live in `/tmp/build`.  It's easier to clean up by hand, and `make clean` is easier to implement this way; otherwise, I suppose it would have to delete `/tmp/atlas-3.8.4.p1/`, `/tmp/blas-...`, etc.  Or `make clean` could not modify SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR at all, but the Make manual suggests that `make clean` (and `make distclean`) should "Also delete files in other directories if they are created by this makefile."

My opinion is that the user should set `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR=/tmp/build` if that's what he wants.

> Or `make clean` could not modify SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR at all, but the Make manual suggests that `make clean` (and `make distclean`) should "Also delete files in other directories if they are created by this makefile."  

I think it does make sense if `make clean` would always clean `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/build` and not `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR`.

Anyway: I don't want to fight over this.  I'm happy with whatever the outcome.  The last thing I want is that this ticket gets abandoned.

```
mkdir -p "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/build"

(and change the error message below)

And also replace

If you really want to go with the "build" subdirectory, I would prefer appending it immediately:

```
if [ -n "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR" ]; then
    SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR="$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/build"
    if [ ! -d "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR" ]; then
        echo "Creating directory \$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR (=$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR)."
        mkdir -p "$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR"
    fi
    echo "Building in $SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR."
else
    SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR="$SAGE_PACKAGES/build"
fi
```
(Actually, the whole `if [ ! -d ] ... fi` block can be removed).

John, 

how do you avoid a possible race condition if two or more instances of Sage (or some other program), want to use /tmp/build? Perhaps /tmp/$user-sage-$SageVersion.$$ might be better. Someone can then find their own Sage-related files easily (for example 

```
rm -rf /tmp/drkirkby-sage-4.5.6*
```
without risk of their being any race condition.

I don't.  If someone wants to set `$SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR`, then I'm making it their responsibility to make sure that the directory is available and in good shape.  (If someone does `export SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR=/tmp/sage` and then we mangle the file name somehow, I think that will lead to confusion much more often than it will help.  We could instead build in `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR/subdir` where we choose `subdir` to avoid race conditions.  But I'm not going to do that.)

Meanwhile, I have new versions of the patches.  I'm going to give in on the "build" subdirectory: Sage will now build in `SAGE_BUILD_TMPDIR`.  Oh, and I changed the name to `SAGE_BUILD_DIR` instead; I think that name makes more sense.  I also patched bzip2 and prereq so they build in `SAGE_BUILD_DIR` as well — easy to do now that the base repo has been merged with the root repo.  `make clean` no longer touches `SAGE_BUILD_DIR`, nor does `make distclean`.  (Also, `make clean` no longer recreates `spkg/build` or `spkg/archive` — what's that directory for, anyway?).

I updated the documentation accordingly.

Well, the old version had a second 'cd' command, justified by the comment

```
# Make triply sure that we are in the build directory before doing  
# a scary "rm -rf"
```
So I left the second one in.  You think I should change this?  In any case, you're right about the "exit 1".

> Line 227 of `sage-spkg`: replace


```

On the off-chance that there is a file (not a directory) in the build directory with the wrong name, shouldn't we move it, too?

Left over from the previous version. I can fix that.
