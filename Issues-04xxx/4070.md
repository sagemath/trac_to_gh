The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/rc1/polybori-0.5rc.p3.spkg

fixes a couple issues:

* delete dynamic libs so that the extension is linked statically
* touch the pbori.pyx extension so that it forces a rebuild

The attached patch also disables m4ri_destroy_all_codes() in pbori.pyx since it causes double frees on OSX. This is maybe related to #1611.

Cheers,

Michael

**Attachment:** [trac_4070.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4070/trac_4070.patch.gz)

Builds fine on:
* x86_64, Core2Duo, Debian GNU/Linux testing (my notebook)
* x86_64, Opteron, Ubuntu (my desktop)
* x86_64, Opteron, Debian GNU/Linux testing (my server at RHUL)
* x86_64, Opteron, Debian GNU/Linux stable (**sage.math**)
* x86_64, 2xCore2Duo, Fedora 8 (**eno**)

Strictly speaking, `libs/polybori/decl.pxi` should be touched instead of `rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx` but this isn't a show stopper for now, since only one module links against PolyBoRi anyway (i.e. `rings.polynomialpbori`)

[18:20] <mabshoff> #4070, patch will be in a second.
[18:20] <mabshoff> There are odd issues in matrix2.pyx on OSX only where there are issues with Matrix inversion.
[18:22] <mabshoff> patch is also up now.
[18:22] <mabshoff> You need that one to fix an issue once the spkg is updated.
[18:39] <mhansen> #4070 fixes the issues for me.
```

## Doctests
### x86_64, Core2Duo, Debian GNU/Linux testing (my notebook)

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/interfaces/sage0.py # 8 doctests failed
```
### x86_64, Opteron, Ubuntu (my desktop)

a lot of segmentation faults, `sage -ba`ing now, might be local problem.

### x86_64, Opteron, Debian GNU/Linux testing (my server at RHUL)

pass

### x86_64, Opteron, Debian GNU/Linux stable (sage.math)

pass

### x86_64, 2xCore2Duo, Fedora 8 (eno)

pass
