Attachment: **[4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4301/4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz)**

So this patch looks good -- I believe that the code does what it claims to. 

However, there are no doctests. 

So if you say "there are no categories that implement anything like this yet," I believe you -- but let's add one, and put it in the docstring, so that we can use this as an example.

Is this patch still current / relevant?

The combinat way of doing things was to make all elements and parents into dynamically generated classes with one half coming from their category and the other half from their implementation. Of course, this makes them Python types, which would be an unacceptable speed regression for, e.g. Integer, so we need some manual lookup in that case. 

What we haven't done is figured out how the these two different approaches would interact, and this should be worked out before applying (some variation of) the above patch.
