Attachment: **[4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4301/4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz)**

So this patch looks good -- I believe that the code does what it claims to. 

However, there are no doctests. 

So if you say "there are no categories that implement anything like this yet," I believe you -- but let's add one, and put it in the docstring, so that we can use this as an example.

I'm going to go ahead and close this as invalid since we decided on another approach for handling these generic method lookups.

Hmm... I must have been confused.  I thought we had worked that out in the categories code.

Is this patch still current / relevant?
