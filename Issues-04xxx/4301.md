Attachment [4301-cat-lookup.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4301/4301-cat-lookup.patch) by @craigcitro created at 2008-11-27 08:16:48

So this patch looks good -- I believe that the code does what it claims to. 

However, there are no doctests. 

So if you say "there are no categories that implement anything like this yet," I believe you -- but let's add one, and put it in the docstring, so that we can use this as an example.

I'm going to go ahead and close this as invalid since we decided on another approach for handling these generic method lookups.

Hmm... I must have been confused.  I thought we had worked that out in the categories code.

Is this patch still current / relevant?

The combinat way of doing things was to make all elements and parents into dynamically generated classes with one half coming from their category and the other half from their implementation. Of course, this makes them Python types, which would be an unacceptable speed regression for, e.g. Integer, so we need some manual lookup in that case. 

What we haven't done is figured out how the these two different approaches would interact, and this should be worked out before applying (some variation of) the above patch.
