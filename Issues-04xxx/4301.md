<a id='comment:1'></a>Attachment [4301-cat-lookup.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4301/4301-cat-lookup.patch) by @craigcitro created at 2008-11-27 08:16:48

So this patch looks good -- I believe that the code does what it claims to. 

However, there are no doctests. 

So if you say "there are no categories that implement anything like this yet," I believe you -- but let's add one, and put it in the docstring, so that we can use this as an example.

What we haven't done is figured out how the these two different approaches would interact, and this should be worked out before applying (some variation of) the above patch.
