Attachment: **[4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket4301/4301-cat-lookup.patch.gz)**

So this patch looks good -- I believe that the code does what it claims to. 

However, there are no doctests. 

So if you say "there are no categories that implement anything like this yet," I believe you -- but let's add one, and put it in the docstring, so that we can use this as an example.
