Since we now automatically make Sage barf when /sw is in PATH, is this ticket invalid?  I no longer have that in my PATH, so I can't test this - someone else?

Yeah, we can close this.  I put it back in my PATH (in fact, the very files listed here are available in my /sw folder!) and got

```
***************************************************
***************************************************
Found Fink in  /sw/bin//fink

*********************************************************

Found either MacPorts or Fink in your PATH, which potentially wrecks the Sage build process.
You should make sure MacPorts and Fink cannot be found.  Either:
(1) rename /opt/local and /sw, or
(2) change PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
(Once Sage is built, you can restore them.)

*********************************************************

make[1]: *** [installed/prereq-0.8] Error 1

real	0m5.581s
user	0m1.715s
sys	0m1.913s
Error building Sage.
make: *** [build] Error 1
new-host-2:sage-4.7.alpha5-Finktest 
```
So I highly doubt this is possible any more.    We haven't gotten a single report of this other than this one in 3 years.  

Also, the sage-check-libraries.py script that found this on #4140 seems to not work any more!  

Anyway, this should be closed.

In the meantime I found #4127, which talks about how to correctly use it.  Sadly, the file itself doesn't tell this (e.g., source sage-env first!).
