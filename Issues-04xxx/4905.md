I've updated the patch to fix the missing less than signs.

The double colons are ReST's way to denote a verbatim environment.  So, we don't want double colons after AUTHOR.

```
 	166	    n 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 B_n 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 7 9

That helps a lot.

Here are some more typos:

* In the section on assmus_mattson_designs:

```
s = |{ i | A_i^* \not= 0, 0<i\leq n-t}|
```
does not output the math correctly. Maybe 

```
$s = |\{ i\ |\ A_i^* \not= 0,\ 0<i\leq n-t\}|$
```
would be better?

Also,

```
 	771	        (1) If `Ai\not= 0` and 
 	772	        `d\leq i\leq n then Ci = { c in C | wt(c) = i}` holds a 
 	773	        simple t-design. 
	774	         
 	775	        (2) If `Ai*\not= 0` and 
 	776	        `d*\leq i\leq n-t then Ci* = { c in C* | wt(c) = i}` 
 	777	        holds a simple t-design. 
```
should maybe be (maybe add a "math::" somewhere?)

```
 	771	        (1) If `Ai\not= 0` and 
 	772	        `d\leq i\leq n` then `C_i = \{ c \in C\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` holds a 
 	773	        simple t-design. 
	774	         
 	775	        (2) If `Ai*\not= 0` and 
 	776	        `d*\leq i\leq n-t` then `C_i^* = \{ c \in C*\ |\ wt(c) = i\}` 
 	777	        holds a simple t-design. 
```
and

```
 	793	        `B = \{supp(c) | c in C_i\}` is the set of supports of the 
```
should be

```
 	793	        `B = \{supp(c)\ |\ c \in C_i\}` is the set of supports of the 
```

* In automorphism_group_binary_code,

```
 	701	                     \{ g in S_n\ |\ g(c) \in C, \forall c\in C\},  
```
should be

```
 	701	                     \{ g \in S_n\ |\ g(c) \in C, \forall c\in C\},  
```

What else needs to be done to review this?
