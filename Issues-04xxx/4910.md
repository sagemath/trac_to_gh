I've found some minor problem in the patch:

```
-  Each *Legendre polynomial* `P_n(x)` is an $n$-th degree polynomial. 
```
Should be

```
-  Each *Legendre polynomial* `P_n(x)` is an `n`-th degree polynomial. 
```

And a little bit lower:

```
 The *Legendre function of the second kind* $Q_n(x)$ is another 
```
Should be

```
 The *Legendre function of the second kind* `Q_n(x)` is another 
```

A whole section

```
Implemented methods: 
  9 latex outout 
  10 __call__ 
[...]
  39 extend_by_zero_to 
  40 unextend 
```
seems to have vanished.

I've manually edited the patch to fixes the two "$" vs "`" problems. The corrected patch should follow. 

The section implemented methods is removed on purpose (it is redundent with the code). Otherwise it seems Ok.

As for combinat, my rereading was a fast rereading. In particular, There are a lot of formulas that needs time to be checked carfully.
