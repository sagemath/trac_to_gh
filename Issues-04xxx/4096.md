This is a follow-up from 4064.  Alex Ghitza and I are doing a big job sorting out the interface with the pari library with respect to (real and complex) precision, where there is currently confusion leading to weird results when word-precision, bit-precision and decimal precision are being confused.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The story so far:  these apply in succession to 3.1.2.rc2:

* Patch 1 (John) [originally called 4064-ell_pari_precision-2.patch]
* Patch 2 (Alex) [..........................................3......]
* Patch 3 (John) Adjusted previous for 64-bit
* Patch 4 (John) ... and readjusted for 32-bit

The number of places where we need separate doctest results for 32- and 64-bit is very reduced but not entirely.  The main work remaining is to sort out the constructor pari(K) where K is a number field.  I thought I had sorted out pari(E) to be identical for 32 and 64 but it is not quite there yet (for E an elliptic curve).

There is no reason for the patch names to ahve ell_ in them, this is absolutely not just about elliptic curves!

John and I agree that it is time for this to be reviewed.

To make this easier, I have put everything into one patch 4096-pari_real_precision_all.patch, which applies to 3.1.2.  There is also a small doc patch 4096-doc_const.patch which fixes a related issue in const.tex, and also applies to 3.1.2.

Note to the reviewer: it would be best to start by scrolling down in the main patch until you hit the top of gen.pyx; there we have inserted a doc section called "Guide to real precision and the Pari library", which documents the correct behavior which is implemented by the patch.
