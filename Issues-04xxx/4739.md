See also #1849 and #3999.

The patch adds code to the AbelianGroups_class so that additive groups can be created, and are output with additive notation.

Further doctests are required to show examples of both additive and multiplicative type in every case.  Subgroup creation (which interfaces with GAP) does not yet work.

As an example (more to come), torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields are now additive.

robertwb asked to have a look at this even though it is not yet finished, so here it is!

NB I still think that the whole abelian group code needs rewriting (as was started in #1849)!

Hi John,

I haven't look at the code too seriously, but what would be your thoughts on having two subclasses (additive and multiplicative) of a common class for the abelian group elements so that one doesn't need to always do a check for the parent's op_symbol?

That would be a very good idea indeed.  The way I see it, there is a base abstract class (in which elements are represented as integer vectors, operation is addition with a modulus for each coordinate corresponding to a generator of finite order);  and then there are two possible interfaces to that base class via user classes which are either additive or multiplicative.

We are surely in a position to provide this structure right now, using the exiting implementations for the base class.  Then the "major rewrite" which we keep on mentioning need only apply to the base class.

I'll continue to think about this;  it does not sound any harder, and is probably easier, than what I have been doing so far.

I agree with mhansen, always checking parent's op_symbol is probably slow, but I think this can be avoided. 

Note that we already have two classes, AdditiveGroupElement and MultiplicativeGroupElement. I think the code here is trying to unify them. both under MultiplicativeGroupElement. Also, note that no typechecking (or coercion) is done for the `__add__` and `__sub__` commands, so if the left and right operand are not the correct type (or, if both are abelian group elements, but in different groups) then either an error or nonsense will be returned. 

For multiplication, do we really want `a * (1+5+O(5^2))` and `a * "50"` to work for a group element a?

That sounds reasonable to me.  There's no chance that this ancient patch would apply now anyway.
