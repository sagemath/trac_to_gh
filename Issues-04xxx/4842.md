Ah. I bet the time was spent resolving the roots of CyclotomicField 
(132) to high enough precision to distinguish them. If you don't come   
up with a patch for this, I'll (probably) do it later tonight.

This took longer than I expected due to build issues I ran into, but here's the patch. It should cover all cases, and use your fast code when the orders divide each other.

For the record: Patch applies, builds fine and all doctests with -long pass. The performance regression seems to have been fixed, i.e. before:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/eisenstein_submodule.py"
	 [73.3 s]
```
After the patch:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/modular/modform/eisenstein_submodule.py"
	 [3.4 s]
```

Cheers,

Michael

This looks very good to me.  The maths is sound, the examples I tried worked, doctests passed and Michael is happy -- what more could we want?  I give this a positive review.
