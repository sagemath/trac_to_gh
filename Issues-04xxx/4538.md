Create a script `sage-walltimekill` SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ that would run
a subprocess, wait a certain amount of time, then killing it.  

```
sage-walltimekill 3600 sage
```
would kill the process it starts after 3600 wall seconds.

This will be useful both for doctesting and the notebook.  It's the sort of
thing ulimit "should" do, but doesn't.

With #717 can we close this as invalid?  Or do you want me to encapsulate the #717 code for some other purpose?

This could still come in useful for example for the notebook, so I would leave it open.

William: any thoughts here?
