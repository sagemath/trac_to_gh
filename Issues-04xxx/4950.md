Michael: Only one has failed to build so far -- mandriva 32-bit.   It
fails thus, and as you can see below, the numpy install fails maybe
due to an ATLAS issue.  This is actually a pretty serious build issue,
and should go in trac, if you agree:

I made this a blocker since Mandriva is in our "officially supported" list according to README.txt
