Do the following: 

* build Sage 3.2
* install the updates scripts.spkg: sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.2.1/sage-3.2.1.alpha2/spkg/standard/sage_scripts-3.2.1.alpha2
* upgrade to Sage 3.2.a2: ./sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.2.1/sage-3.2.1.alpha2/

Things go boom (due to a dependency bug in setup.py - it has been fixed in 3.2.1.alpha1, but somehow that setup.py is not used):

```
Building sage/matrix/action.pyx because it depends on sage/structure/parent.pxd.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 486, in <module>
    queue = compile_command_list(ext_modules, deps)
  File "setup.py", line 456, in compile_command_list
    dep_file, dep_time = deps.newest_dep(f)
  File "setup.py", line 371, in newest_dep
    for f in self.all_deps(filename):
  File "setup.py", line 354, in all_deps
    deps.update(self.all_deps(f, path))
  File "setup.py", line 352, in all_deps
    for f in self.immediate_deps(filename):
  File "setup.py", line 334, in immediate_deps
    self._deps[filename] = self.parse_deps(filename)
  File "setup.py", line 290, in parse_deps
    f = open(filename)
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'sage/rings/mpfr.pxi'
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```


Then sage-3.2.1.alpha0.spkg as well as the doc.spkg are missing. Deleting the Cython cache and a sage -ba gets you a working Sage again.

But make is unhappy:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.2.final$ make
cd spkg && ./install all 2>&1 | tee -a ../install.log
/bin/ls: doc-*.spkg: No such file or directory

To install gap, gp, singular, etc., scripts
in a standard bin directory, start sage and
type something like
   sage: install_scripts('/usr/local/bin')
at the SAGE command prompt.
```
Doing another

* ./sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.2.1/sage-3.2.1.alpha2/

replaces the missing spkgs and everything is fine.

Cheers,

Michael
