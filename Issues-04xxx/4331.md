Change the sage vmware image so there is another login option:

```
login: keyboard
```

This would run `dpkg-reconfigure console-setup`
as suggested by Martin Rubey in email:

```

Nearly: you will then be asked some simple questions which are obvious to
answer if you do not have an english keyboard.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
There seems to be no plan to resume producing
the vmware image at each Sage release.

Its main use was arguably to work around
the lack of a version of Sage for Windows.

That use case largely fell with Erik Bray's
Cygwin-based Sage installer for 64-bit Windows.

The Sage Debian Live distribution also
provides a versatile portable solution.

In view of that, ok to close this.
