Change the sage vmware image so there is another login option:

```
login: keyboard
```

This would run `dpkg-reconfigure console-setup`
as suggested by Martin Rubey in email:

```

Nearly: you will then be asked some simple questions which are obvious to
answer if you do not have an english keyboard.

There seems to be no plan to resume producing
the vmware image at each Sage release.

Its main use was arguably to work around
the lack of a version of Sage for Windows.

That use case largely fell with Erik Bray's
Cygwin-based Sage installer for 64-bit Windows.

The Sage Debian Live distribution also
provides a versatile portable solution.

In view of that, ok to close this.
