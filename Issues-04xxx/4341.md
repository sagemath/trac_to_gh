This applies cleanly to 3.2 and passes sage -testall. However, I have several (possibly very stupid) questions about the docstrings, which I've passed on to the author off-list (to save myself the embarrassment of asking dumb questions:-). I prefer to wait until I hear back to give an appraisal.

Attachment [ch-latin.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket4341/ch-latin.patch) by @wdjoyner created at 2008-11-23 12:51:21

Regarding the "to do" using nauty: please don't. Robert Miller's code NICE does this fine:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.matrices.latin import *
sage: M = matrix([(0, 1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 0, 1), (3, 2, 1, 0), (1, 0, 3, 2)])
sage: L = LatinSquare(M)
sage: L.is_latin_square()
True
sage: from sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_matrices import MatrixStruct
sage: A = MatrixStruct(M)
sage: autgp = A.automorphism_group()
sage: gens = [[j+1 for j in autgp[0][i]] for i in range(len(autgp[0]))]
sage: S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: G = PermutationGroup([S4(x) for x in gens]); G
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2)(3,4)]
```
An easy "to do": take the very short MOLS codes in Guava (included in Sage), at
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/guava/lib/matrices.gi,
and translate it into Python/Sage/latin.py code. (MOLS are used to construct optimal non-linear codes, but non-linear codes have not yet been implemented in Sage.)

I'm currently running tests on this (second) patch and will post again soon.
