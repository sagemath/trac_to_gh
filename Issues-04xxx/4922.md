Looks good.  One tiny change: 

sage/monoids/free_monoid.py, line 156: change ``i`th` to ``i`-th`.

(This is in a function whose name starts with double underscores, so it isn't even in the reference manual.  Just in case we add such things to the reference manual eventually, though...)

After this change, positive review.
