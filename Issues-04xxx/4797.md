-When upgrading Cython like at #4639 we should really run a -ba on upgrade and not just a -b since the new Cython version in this case does fix some fundamental issues the way exceptions are handled. In general I would sleep much better if we do this in general since many potentially odd Heisenbugs that disappear after either a partial -b or a -ba would be avoided that way if a new Cython version is involved.
+We should really run `sage -ba` on upgrade and not just `sage -b`.  This is for example needed after the numpy upgrade in sage-4.6.1.alpha0, see #9808.
 
-Cheers,

+(note: earlier versions of this ticket mentioned `sage -ba` only in the case of a *cython* upgrade, but it's probably better to do `sage -ba` always after upgrading -- Jeroen Demeyer).

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
Running `sage -ba` *explicitly* is not even necessary upon (true) Cython upgrades, though we could implement this in `spkg/install`.

We just have to make any Cython file / extension module depend on a single, distinct file of the Cython distribution (e.g. header) and preferably make sure this is *only* touched when really necessary.

Therefore it would make sense to use a Sage-specific file for such, which is created and managed by our `spkg-install` for Cython.

People upgrading the Cython package will best know if a complete rebuild will be necessary, depending on the Cython version found in the current installation subject to upgrade.
