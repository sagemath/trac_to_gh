I created ticket #10124 to implement this.

Running `sage -ba` *explicitly* is not even necessary upon (true) Cython upgrades, though we could implement this in `spkg/install`.

We just have to make any Cython file / extension module depend on a single, distinct file of the Cython distribution (e.g. header) and preferably make sure this is *only* touched when really necessary.

Therefore it would make sense to use a Sage-specific file for such, which is created and managed by our `spkg-install` for Cython.

People upgrading the Cython package will best know if a complete rebuild will be necessary, depending on the Cython version found in the current installation subject to upgrade.
