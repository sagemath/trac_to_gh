The code looks fine.  However, I'm getting a doctest failure in finite_field_ntl_gf2e.pyx:

```
File "/opt/sage/tmp/finite_field_ntl_gf2e.py", line 1018:

I can't tell where this is coming from.

Robert, Alex,

applying this patch only to my merge tree does not result in any doctest failure, so I am giving this a positive review. Hopefully this will not bit us in the ass down the road ;)
