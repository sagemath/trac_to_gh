In SAGE 3.2.1 , the docstring of divisors says:

Definition: divisors(n)
Docstring:

        Returns a list of all positive integer divisors
        of the nonzero integer n.

        A second parameter may be passed to surpress sorting
        of the list (as ordering the list can be more time
        consuming then creating it).

        INPUT:
            n -- the element
            sorted -- whether or not to sort the output (default True)

My question is how to get an unsorted output?

I tried divisors(300, sorted=False) but SAGE complaints that divisors
only takes 1 argument. In fact, the source codes seem to suggest that
it will always return a sorted list.
```

Now the divisors are always returned sorted (as we have resolved the issue of sorting taking the majority of the time). The documentation needs to be fixed.
