On OSX we delete libpng.dylib due to missing symbols when building R and python. But this is causing trouble for code at #3324 for example. The spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.1.2/alpha3/libpng-1.2.22.p8.spkg

does no longer delete the old dynamic lib. But this ticket needs to be merged with the following two tickets updating R and python.
