I think this is a reasonable bug report.  The fix is for Sage to
include the cached precompiled versions of the Magma files.
It used to be with Magma that one had to start it up as root
once because they didn't include precompiled files.  I think
this has changed, i.e., I think they now ship the precompiled
cached files in addition to the source files.

I attched each m file from the extcode repo and then added each .sig file to the repo. Pointless, but what the hell :)

Cheers,

Unfortunately, this doesn't work.  Probably the .sig files depend on the version of Magma.  I tried applying your patch and got then using it as a different user and got:

```
Runtime error in 'AttachSpec': Could not remove the invalid signature file /Users/wstein/sage/data/extcode//magma/latex/latex.sig
```

Since there are dozens of Magma versions out there, and we can't know which one people are using, there is literally *no possible way* to solve this problem without the user running a command such as 

```
sage: magma('2') 
```
as a user with write permissions to the extcode/magma directory. 

Since the error message clearly states that this is a permissions problem, there is nothing further to do really (i.e., nothing on the sage side).  This is just the way Magma works.
