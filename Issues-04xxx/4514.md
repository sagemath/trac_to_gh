The element below is constructed as an element of GL(2,7), but when converted into an element in GL(2,7) it is not equal to itself.

```
sage: G = GL(2,7)
sage: z = G.center().an_element()
sage: z
[3 0]
[0 3]
sage: z in G
True
sage: G(z)
[3 0]
[0 3]
sage: G(z) == z
False
sage: G(G(z)) == G(z)
True
```

Hmm. Maybe this isn't a bug afterall: the element z isn't really from G, but from G.center().
