<a id='comment:21'></a>There seems to be a problem inserting new cells in Safari after focus has shifted to and from another application.  Reloading the page fixes this but its a bug.

Okay, now for bad news. :)

* If I start typing "`plot(bess`" into a cell and hit tab to complete, I get "`plot%28bess`"
* If I type "`plot(`" and hit tab, I get "`plot%3F`".
* I also sometimes see the problems that [comment:21 mhampton reports] with inserting new cells.
* I haven't figured out what does this, but frequently it gets stuck: there's the light green bar below a cell for something that's being evaluated, but there's no \/\/\/ blinky in the title. I can't do anything at that point other than quit -- interrupting, restarting, etc don't have any effect.

I tried with IE7 (in an XP virtual machine) and got the same tab-completion problems, but not the other problems.
