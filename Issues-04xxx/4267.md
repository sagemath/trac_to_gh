Jason,

the patch is now at

Either way, we should seriously consider resetting the extcode repo since the history is huge and there is relatively little benefit to keep it around considering the size.

I have a brand-new 3.1.4 install as well.  The extcode patch applies perfectly for me when I do the following, so something seems odd.  The patch just deletes a bunch of directories for cleanup purposes; applying the extcode patch should not change any functionality.

```
cd sage/data/extcode
wget http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/extcode-remove-javascript-packages.patch
hg qinit
hg qimport extcode-remove-javascript-packages.patch
hg qpush
```

I then also applied the edit-in-place-and-javascript-spkgs.patch patch from above to the main sage repository.

I then installed all the packages (except the jsmath-image-fonts one) from http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/notebook/.  I used "sage -f <package>.spkg" to install these to make sure to overwrite the current package.

I then did sage -br

Then I started the notebook and everything seemed to work great (including the shift-click).  What browser are you using?  I'm using FF 3.0.1 on Ubuntu 8.04.

The upgrade to the newest version of jqueryui changed the default theme.  It would be very easy to change back, or to design a new theme (with different colors, etc.).

If there is enough people wanting it, I will include the old theme as the default theme.  I don't really have a preference, though I think I do like the old sliders better.  It was easier to feel like you were moving them to a precise value since they weren't so big.

Would it be enough to just change the slider image back to the old image?

Okay, now for bad news. :)

* If I start typing "`plot(bess`" into a cell and hit tab to complete, I get "`plot%28bess`"
* If I type "`plot(`" and hit tab, I get "`plot%3F`".
* I also sometimes see the problems that [mhampton reports](#comment%3A21) with inserting new cells.
* I haven't figured out what does this, but frequently it gets stuck: there's the light green bar below a cell for something that's being evaluated, but there's no \/\/\/ blinky in the title. I can't do anything at that point other than quit -- interrupting, restarting, etc don't have any effect.

1. Make all the existing javascript code spkgs
2. Various jquery-related cleanups of the javascript code
3. Add TinyMCE as an (optional?) spkg
4. Make the shift-click work (in-place wysiwyg editing).
