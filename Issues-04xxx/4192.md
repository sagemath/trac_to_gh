```
Functions like `is_FractionField` should not be imported at the top level, since they don't necessarily make sense mathematically, only programmatically. Thus, situations like

```
sage: is_FractionField(FractionField(ZZ))
False
```
might confuse people.  

See the discussion in #4149. I think the best solution, as propounded there by cremona and robertwb, is to have `is_Blah` *methods* which are, as much as possible, mathematically correct.  In contrast, `is_Blah` *functions* should be data-checks, existing primarily for use in the code.

mhansen has volunteered to do at least some of this work.
