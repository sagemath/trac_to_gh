The problem has been diagnosed by me and Alex and I'll post a patch shortly.

The infinite loop was fixed by Alex, who then said

```
We seem to have run into a different problem, though:

sage: E = EllipticCurve("4390c2")
sage: P = E.gens()[0]
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=64)
0.000256387258865202254
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=65)
0.0002563872588652022535 + 0.004614954316673684681*I
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=128)
0.00025638725886520225353198932528666427412 + 0.0046149543166736846806755335569568366865*I
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=129)
0.00025638725886520225353198932528666427412
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=256)
0.0002563872588652022535319893252866642741168388008346370015005142128009610936373
sage: P.elliptic_logarithm(precision=257)
0.00025638725886520225353198932528666427411683880083463700150051421280096109363730 + 0.0046149543166736846806755335569568366865361459796795879146958143680521472570409*I

This is quite upsetting.
```
to which John replied

```
The explanation is that  0.004614954316673684681*I is the imaginary
period.  the point P is on the identity component so its e-log should
be a real multiple of the real period, but is obviously only
determined up to addition of any period.  Clearly the pari code does
not bother about that.

Here's one fix:  if P.is_on_identity_component(emb) is True then we
know that the result should be real, so we can kill the imaginary
part, and also normalise by making sure that the real part divided by
the real period is in [0,1).  That's not hard.  And if P is not on the
id. component, do the same but set the imaginary part to equal exactly
half the imaginary period.
```

The attached patch does both.  Based on 3.2.2, tested on 32-bit and 64-bit.
