Do we have any sage interface code to go with this yet? I know some was produced at Sage days 10. 

Then these extensions should be added based in whether or not this package is installed `sage.misc.package.is_package_installed()`.

Bindings are being written. The spkg should become optional so it is easily buildable from any Sage install. Once/If mpc is standard the mpc.spkg would also become standard.

Hi Philippe,

I have reviewed your updated spkg. A couple comments:

* Everything looks good, but some minor details I fixed
* Checked in the changes you added to the repo in your name
* added a .hgignore and added some small cleanups to spkg-install

I also deleted the attached spkg since large files should not be attached to trac, but linked from some webspace. 

The updated spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/release-cycles-3.2.1/rc1/mpc-0.5.p0.spkg

In case you improve/update the mpc.spkg please use that one as a base.

Summary: positive review.

Cheers,

Michael
