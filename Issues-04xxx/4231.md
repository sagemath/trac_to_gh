When evaluating this in the notebook:

%magma
polt<t> := RationalFunctionField(Rationals());
R<w,x,y,z> := PolynomialRing(polt, 4);
Q0 := w^3 + x^3 + y^3 + z^3;
Q := (w+x)*(w+2*y)*(w+3*z) + 3*x*y*(w+x+z);
Qt := Q0 + t*Q;
Qt_gradient := [Derivative(Qt, w), Derivative(Qt, x), Derivative(Qt, y), Derivative(Qt, z)];
Qt_jac := IdealWithFixedBasis(Qt_gradient);

I believe that Sage uses temp files for inputs larger than a certain
size.  It seems this long input passed that size and you're seeing a
"verbose loading" message.  Not really an error message, but I'm sure
William can add it to his list of Magma interface things to do.

The first half of the patch does indeed fix the issue reported.

The second half of this patch adds a doctest showing that the patch really works,
more precisely this doctest fails without the patch.

However the new doctest fails also (earlier) if no local magma install may be found.

I'd vote nevertheless to take this patch in right now; and then apply #4240 as soon as possible. Other solution would imply having to change the patch(es) in #4240 accordingly, which seems to be superfluous work.

Better luck next time since I don't want to break the followup patch - which is not ready for review and either way itself needs to add a couple #optional tags anyway.
