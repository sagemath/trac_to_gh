From [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/TpG75SlXTRE/wo8rGfE76W8J):


```
sage: u = cot(pi*x)
sage: u.is_zero()  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    378             return 1/math.tan(x)

```


There are many objects which end up as `x` in `Function_cot._evalf_()` that do not support `.cot()`.

We should check if the other functions in `sage/functions/trig.py` handle more input types properly.

worksforme:

```
sage: sage: u = cot(pi*x)
sage: sage: u.is_zero()  
False
```
