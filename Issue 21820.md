# Issue 21820: Resultant of symbolic polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22057

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2016-12-14 16:03:10

GiNaC/Pynac contains an internal multivariate resultant function which uses the internal matrix implementation. This ticket exposes the function to the user. The restriction to symbolic polynomials could be removed in a later step.

If you could break the one long line of output to less than 80 chars, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
