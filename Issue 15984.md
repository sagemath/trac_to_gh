# Issue 15984: Add (symbolic) Struve functions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-04-23 14:23:30

Apparently Maxima has this.

```
struve_h (v,z)                 Struve H function
struve_l (v,z)                 Struve L function
```

See #15024 and the [symbolic wiki on Trac](http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics/functions) for more detail.

Comments, putting 'needs info' just so the status is clear.
* Think we should implement A&S 12.1.15 or 12.2.10?
* This

```
sage: struve_L(i.n(),100)
1.07916123209824e42 + 4.90584803419713e22*I
```

  doesn't seem to agree with [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=struve+L+%28i%2C100%29), though I don't know whether it should even be implemented.
* [W functions](http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/StruveH/introductions/Struves/05/) claims something that isn't in A&S but that certainly works with mpmath:

```
sage: struve_H(-2,0)
struve_H(-2, 0)
sage: struve_H(-3,0)
struve_H(-3, 0)
sage: struve_H(-3,0).n()
0.000000000000000
sage: struve_H(-2,0).n()
0.000000000000000
sage: struve_H(-7/2,0)
struve_H(-7/2, 0)
sage: struve_H(-7/2,0).n()
0.000000000000000
```

* Maybe doctest at least a couple of the interfaces, at least with mpmath and Maxima?  (I don't know if Maxima returns any of these when you plug in this particular DE, but if it did that would be perfect.)

Otherwise I think this is definitely ready to get in, and a useful addition!

One more thing - just like in #15024, probably there should be a little top-matter added, just for completeness.


---

(Interestingly, #18257 doesn't seem to afflict this one - maybe it didn't add as many functions as #15024.)

That should do it. Could you please have a final glance?

According to the [developer guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings), `.. math::` would better be `.. MATH::`.

There is a strange carret here (appears twice)

```
+        r"""
+    ^    EXAMPLES::
+
```

doc of `_print_latex_` is not formatted correctly (twice)

REFERENCE blocks are not formatted correctly either.

The references in `functions/` need some love in general.
