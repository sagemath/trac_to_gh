Apparently Maxima has this.

```
struve_h (v,z)                 Struve H function
struve_l (v,z)                 Struve L function
```

Comments, putting 'needs info' just so the status is clear.
* Think we should implement A&S 12.1.15 or 12.2.10?
* This

```
sage: struve_L(i.n(),100)
1.07916123209824e42 + 4.90584803419713e22*I
```

  doesn't seem to agree with [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=struve+L+%28i%2C100%29), though I don't know whether it should even be implemented.
* [W functions](http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/StruveH/introductions/Struves/05/) claims something that isn't in A&S but that certainly works with mpmath:

```
sage: struve_H(-2,0)
struve_H(-2, 0)
sage: struve_H(-3,0)
struve_H(-3, 0)
sage: struve_H(-3,0).n()
0.000000000000000
sage: struve_H(-2,0).n()
0.000000000000000
sage: struve_H(-7/2,0)
struve_H(-7/2, 0)
sage: struve_H(-7/2,0).n()
0.000000000000000
```

* Maybe doctest at least a couple of the interfaces, at least with mpmath and Maxima?  (I don't know if Maxima returns any of these when you plug in this particular DE, but if it did that would be perfect.)

Otherwise I think this is definitely ready to get in, and a useful addition!
