* please cross-review reviewer patch.
* documentation of the parameter `write_in_every_step` is unclear in all occurrences: what does "the output is stored" mean? It seems that it means that instead of processing the input word, all prefixes of the input word are processed.
* parameter `process_iterator_class`: the consequences of setting this parameter are not explained.
* `_FSMProcessIteratorAll_`: "but only accepts": remove "only"?
