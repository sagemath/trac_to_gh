Keywords: gap libgap gappy

[gappy](https://github.com/embray/gappy) is a new Python/Cython package providing a Python interface to GAP using its public "libgap" API (to the extent possible).

It is the result of extracting Sage's `sage.libs.gap` package into a standalone package without a dependency on Sage, so it still bears some of the legacy of that package (which will continue to be cleaned up and improved on).  It may also introduce some minor performance improvements in some areas, but it will be interesting to test this with some non-trivial examples.

This ticket is to attempt to convert `sage.libs.gap` to a wrapper around gappy (rather than replace it entirely).  The main reason a wrapper is still needed, is in order to participate in Sage's coercion model.

The GAP interpreter wrapper class `sage.libs.gap.libgap.Gap` is a `Parent`, and its elements are instances of `GapElement` and subclasses thereof which are subclasses of `Element`.

This presents a challenge which makes wrapping gappy less straightforward than one would hope: Because the classes `gappy.Gap` and `gappy.GapObj` (its equivalent of `GapElement`) are cdef classes, as well as `Parent` and `Element`, it is not possible to use multiple inheritance like


```
class GapElement(GapObj, Element):
    ...
```


because their base structs are incompatible.  The current workaround to this is that `GapElement` is a wrapper for a `GapObj` (which in turn wraps C-level GAP `Obj` pointers).  This creates a bit of unfortunate overhead, albeit not much; by using `cdef` and `cpdef` methods, Cython can make the call to wrapped objects reasonably fast in many cases.


### Food for thought...

There are some other possible workarounds to this issue I would like to explore in the future.

The first is to change how gappy works: Rather than `Gap` and `GapObj` being `cdef` classes, they could be pure-Python wrappers around some `cdef` classes.  This would again create some overhead, but hopefully not too much.  Then they can participate in multiple inheritance with Sage's `Parent` and `Element` classes.

The other two, which would be much more disruptive, but also possibly useful for other packages that would like to integrate with Sage without explicitly depending on it, and have been discussed before:

1) Create a relatively Sage "base" package with little to no mathematical functionality but that provides base classes for some of Sage's structural classes such as `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` (maybe also `CategoryObject`?).  These base classes need not replicate the full functionality found in Sage, but just enough to provide some bootstrapping.  If the package is relatively small and easily pip-installable, packages like gappy can use it as a dependency without requiring all of Sage.

2) A similar but subtly different option is to make classes like `SageObject`, `Parent`, and `Element` into Abstract Base Classes.  Classes in other packages can then be registered as psuedo-subclasses of these ABCs without directly subclassing them, so long as they implement the necessary interfaces.  This option is appealing to me since it means classes from other packages can more easily interface with Sage without requiring any additional dependencies.  However, it is potentially more disruptive: There isn't a way to ensure that classes which register to an ABC to provide the same C-level interface (C methods and attributes).  So Cython-level code that types variables as `Parent` or `Element` won't work here, and would have to provide a separate (typically slower) code path for handle ABC pseudo-subclasses.  Fortunately there is not a ton of code like this in Sage, but there is some, especially in code related to the coercion model, unsurprisingly.

Thanks for pointing it out.  I thought I remembered there being a ticket for that.  I didn't realize you already had a prototype in the works.

Travis, I'm curious about your take on this, especially on the impact to permutation groups, since this partly reverts #25609, which I see you worked on.  AFAICT this makes some minor performance improvements in construction of permutation groups from Sage -> GAP, but might be a little slower for going from GAP -> Sage.

Big +1 on this work (but I know too little about GAP to review)

A quick remark on `install-requires`: For prerelease versions, it's best to use the exact version; version ranges may not work (see
https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30913#comment:81), 
so it should be `gappy ==0.1.0a0`

`gappy` is an excellent news!

I would like to bring the attention to cypari2 that played the role of gappy at the time the PARI/GP interface in Sage became an independent Cython module. In particular, if any design decision has to be made, it would be weird if they would be different for both interfaces.

First of all, two things that seem different from the rough description of the ticket
- there is no extra layer between cypari2 and Sage. Sage deals with `cypari2.gen.Gen` objects directly.
- cypari2 is completely agnostic to Sage and its coercion system

There was no need for coercion because the most basic possible happen : in any mixture, everything is converted to a cypari2 Gen object. Here with integers

```
sage: type(1 + pari(1))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
sage: type(pari(1) + 1)
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
```

Here with matrices

```
sage: type(pari("[1, 2; 3, 4]") + matrix(2, [1,1,1,1]))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
sage: type(matrix(2, [1,1,1,1]) + pari("[1, 2; 3, 4]"))
<class 'cypari2.gen.Gen'>
```

I do not see the difference here with the GAP interface. In what sort of construction the interaction with categories/coercion has to be handled? I would like a more concrete description if possible.

On a related note, cypari2 introduced the standardized name `__pari__` for the method that would provide a conversion of any object to its cypari2 equivalent. That way, any Python library could make interaction with cypari2.

For the cypari2 -> Sage conversion, there is `sage.libs.pari.convert_sage.gen_to_sage` which is a partial but efficient converter. It introduced a slowdown in conversions PARI/GP -> Sage because the `sage` method on `cypari2.gen.Gen` (which was kept) became

```python
cdef class Gen:
    def sage(self, locals=None):
        r"""
        Return the closest SageMath equivalent of the given PARI object.

        INPUT:

        - ``locals`` -- optional dictionary used in fallback cases that
          involve ``sage_eval``

        See :func:`~sage.libs.pari.convert_sage.gen_to_sage` for more information.
        """
        from sage.libs.pari.convert_sage import gen_to_sage
        return gen_to_sage(self, locals)
```

AFAICT this makes some minor performance improvements in construction of permutation groups from Sage -> GAP, but might be a little slower for going from GAP -> Sage.

A good stress test would be iterating through the E<sub>7</sub> Weyl group:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('E7', implementation='permutation')
sage: W.cardinality()                                                                                                     
2903040
sage: %time for w in W.iteration('depth', False): pass                                                                    
CPU times: user 1.05 s, sys: 391 µs, total: 1.05 s
Wall time: 1.05 s
```

If you are more brave, do E<sub>8</sub> (which has 696729600 elements), but that will take many minutes to complete. D<sub>9</sub> is perhaps a better intermediate example:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup('D9', implementation='permutation')                                                                
sage: W.cardinality()                                                                                                     
92897280
sage: %time for w in W.iteration('depth', False): pass                                                                    
CPU times: user 34.4 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 34.4 s
Wall time: 34.4 s
```


As long as the slowdown is relatively small, then I think this is a good way forward as it makes maintenance easier. Plus it will benefit the broader community.

so at least for this case no better but no worse.

Thanks for your comments Vincent.  Yes, this is definitely intended in the same vein as cypari2.

I think this is what I would prefer as well.

Here's the same examples using gappy directly.  The integers work:


```
sage: from gappy import gap                                                                                                                                                                      
sage: type(1 + gap(1))                                                                                                                                                                           
<class 'gappy.gapobj.GapInteger'>
sage: type(gap(1) + 1)                                                                                                                                                                           
<class 'gappy.gapobj.GapInteger'>
```


but the matrices do not for some reason; I think because gappy uses a `_gap_` magic method (similarly to `__pari__`, but this conflicts with Sage's existing `_gap_` magic method for using the GAP pexpect interface).  I get:


```
sage: type(gap([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) + matrix(2, [1, 1, 1, 1]))

However, if I do this:

It has the necessary converters registered to handle `SageObject`s correctly.

So it looks like gappy and cypari2 are indeed mostly similar in this case.

Honestly, I do not know.  I don't even understand the coercion system well-enough to say.  It's just because the old `sage.libs.gap` did use it, so I tried, for now, to keep the same interface for a couple reasons:

* Backwards compatibility--I didn't want to break the existing API too much, especially if someone is writing code that explicitly checks for Sage `GapElement`s.  I do not know if anyone is actually doing this.

* Consistency--the other Sage interfaces to other languages use the Parent/Element model so I just tried to keep that consistent.  Maybe it is not really necessary or useful though.  If someone can confirm for me that it isn't then we can use gappy more-or-less directly and do a way with a lot of extra complexity.

This is one area where I think it's still useful to have wrapper classes in Sage; which is just to add a `.sage()` methods to gappy `GapObj`s.  But if they don't have to be `Element` subclasses, then they can simply subclass `GapObj` rather than wrap them.

Another possibility is that just as user classes can have a `_gap_` method to convert to GAP-compatible representations, gappy could add a system for registering "GAP -> <whatever>" converters.  They could have `.sage()` methods tacked on to them without having to make subclasses.

Could we try to make the direct interface work as well? I mean as far as binary operators are concerned, it should be fine to mix gappy elements with SageMath elements. If an intermediate layer is needed it could also be introduced. I think gappy is a good occasion to clean the design of the gap interface.

hmm. PARI/GP is a counterexemple to that.

One construction I can imagine where the layer could be relevant is if you want to use some gap objects as coefficients of a matrix. To do that, you would use

```
sage: MatrixSpace(GapBaseRing(), 3, 3)
```

where `GapBaseRing()` would be a GapObj modelling a ring of numbers. Then if `GapBaseRing()` is not recognized as a proper ring from SageMath such construction would be impossible. I am not sure it is currently used anywhere.

> > On a related note, cypari2 introduced the standardized name `__pari__` for the method that would provide a conversion of any object to its cypari2 equivalent. That way, any Python library could make interaction with cypari2.

Actually one could use `__gap__` (double underscore) for the gappy objects and keep the single underscore `_gap_/_libgap_` for the one with coercion layer. The double score convention is more Pythonic and, I think, prefered outside of [SageMath](SageMath). Moreover, I believe the simple underscore could be as generic as

```
file: src/sage/structure/element.pyx

cdef class Element(SageObject):
    def _gap_(self):
        from sage.libs.gap.wrapper import GappyWrapperWithCoercion
        return GappyWrapperWithCoercion(self.__gap__())
```

Having something flexible (ie runtime registration) looks like a better deal. Still what would be the main converter call? Whatever system could argue for having `GapObj.my_super_system_conversion()` in gappy. Or you wanted the `GapObj.my_super_system_conversion()` to be created at runtime?

I was explicitly avoiding this for gappy since the Python documentation [discourages](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers) use of custom dunder methods.  I believe we had some bikeshedding about this with `__pari__` as well, though I don't actually recall what side I fell on at that time.

On the other hand, it would be nice and consistent with `__pari__`, and it seems pretty unlikely that Python will use the name `__gap__` for anything any time soon (though stranger things have happened).  Numpy also has a long history of using custom dunder methods, though it prefixes most of them with `__numpy_`.

Will respond to the rest of the comment later.

The new version I just pushed shows some examples of how it works: https://gappy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#gappy.gapobj.GapObj.convert_to

See in particular the example of


```
@GapList.convert_to('numpy')
```


which registers a converter from `GapList` to Numpy arrays.  Same could be done for `GapFoo.convert_to('sage')`.

Integer constructor has a special case for cypari2

```
file: src/sage/rings/integer.pyx
cdef class Integer(Element):
    def __init__(self, x):
        ...
        elif isinstance(x, pari_gen):
            set_from_pari_gen(self, x)
```

This is the general approach taken by cypari2. Though, maybe it is not desirable to clutter the sage element constructors.

Comment by embray created at 2021-02-05 11:35:48

Maybe just as there is `__pari__` and `__gap__` we should develop a standard for a `__sage__` magic method that Sage can call on objects from other libraries in order to get their equivalent representation as a Sage type.

For now I could add a special case in the Integer constructor but I agree it's not ideal.  I noticed it's also the case in the permutation element 


```
cdef class PermutationGroupElement(MultiplicativeGroupElement):

    def __init__(self, g, parent, check=True):
        ...
        elif isinstance(g, GapElement):
            if isinstance(g, GapElement_Permutation):
                self._set_libgap(g.obj)
            elif isinstance(g, GapElement_String):
                self._set_string(g.sage())
            elif isinstance(g, GapElement_List):
                self._set_list_images(g.sage(), convert)
            else:
                raise ValueError("invalid data to initialize a permutation")
        ...
```


So, nothing very "magic" going on...

Just for the record, another idea I considered is providing an interface to gappy to allow it to replace the base class for objects returned by it, sort of like how Sage Parents have an Element attribute, it would be possible to subclass `gappy.Gap` and provide a different base class.  This would also have a mechanism for instantiating the correct subclass of the base class (e.g. `GapPermutation` or `GapElement_Permutation`).

However, I don't know that this has much of a use case outside of Sage.  For now I'm working on a more disruptive approach inspired by the cypari2 conversion to just use gappy more directly and do away with `GapElement`.

Just a quick note that the compile-time dependency of `sage.rings.integer` on various libraries will be a major obstacle to modularization (#29705), see #30022.  This will become relevant later (perhaps in the Sage 9.5 cycle according to current plans), but it won't block immediate development, so I have no objections.

Good point. The remark applies equally to gappy and cypari2 (and possibly other libraries).

In the same vein that Erik proposed in [comment:26] we could introduce a way to register conversions to Sage so that `ZZ(my_cypari2_object)` (construction from the parent) works. One would then drop the support for `Integer(my_cypari2_object)` (construction from the element class). There will be some time penalty in doing this. But fast conversion functions would remain available in `sage.libs.pari`.

On the other hand, `Integer` does implement a `__pari__` method for conversion to cypari2. That should be changed at the same time.

Beyond conversions, many methods of `Integer` depend exlicitely on `__pari__`
- `perfect_power`
- `is_prime_power`
- `is_prime`
- `next_probable_prime`
- `next_prime`
- `previous_prime`
- etc
Given that, I don't see how we could make `Integer` independent of cypari2 without removing most of it functionalities.

These are just Python methods, not `cdef`'s, right?
I think they can just be patched into the class in the same way that https://pypi.org/project/recursive-monkey-patch/ does

Crucial for the modularization is really just that the compiled Cython module no longer has such compile-time dependencies.

Not really. `Integer` is an extension class, hence not extensible by any mean.

On the other hand `Element.__getattribute__` already dispatches fairly dynamically via `getattr_from_category`, so...

The problem with that is it is relatively slow IIRC. It might be better to have a Python subclass of `Integer` that can be monkey patched.

I wonder if a minimal Integer base type wouldn't also be helpful here.  Again all we need are base classes that have the same struct layout, and maybe a minimum of methods defined.

No, but a plain Python subclass of it is.

Another important example that doesn't work without coercion support which did before is evaluation of polynomials on GAP objects:


```
sage: from gappy import gap
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)

This doesn't work with PARI gens either unless you convert the polynomial to PARI explicitly first.

TIL: The coercion model does in fact already support a `_sage_` magic method, though it wasn't so easy for me to find: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/coercion/sage/structure/coerce.html?highlight=_sage_#sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel.canonical_coercion

Adding this to `GapObj` makes it work:


```
sage: one = libgap(1)

I wonder why pari_gen doesn't support this too.

Hrm, the problem with the above example though is that with `GapElement` the result of evaluating a polynomial on a `GapElement` is another `GapElement`, whereas here it just converts it to the appropriate Sage type and evaluates the polynomial on that.
