The bug will probably be easy to fix if its location in the source code can be found. Presumably, the latex string for a power series is constructed by concatenating the latex strings of its parts. To kill the bug, add a space in between: change `latex(a) + latex(b)` to `latex(a) + ' ' + latex(b)`. This is safe, because latex ignores extraneous spaces in math formulas.

(For anyone who does not know latex: `\betax` should be `\beta x`.)
