Keywords: coercion, element, power, zero

In the generic structure of element, a coercion is called to compute an element z to the power of 0 : z^0

The goal of this ticket is trying to replace all call of Parent(1) by Parent.one() to avoid the coercion. (and hope Sage is ready for a such change...)

I looked at the three parents for which elements didn't pass the tests. Every times, it seems clear to me that they deserve to have a method one. I had some. I also fixed some typos on the way and ran a 'delete-trailing-whitespace' which make the patch a little bit more long...

I hope all will be fix now with this one.

Bonjour Nicolas!

Thanks for your work on that. Please investigate the test failure reported by the patchbot, and double check that TestSuite is run on every parent that you modified. While we are at it, we probably want to implement ``.one()`` as a cached_method. I am not sure about the deletion of trailing whitespaces outside of the lines you change anyway, as this is subject to making conflicts.

Ah, and do we want to do the same for .zero()?

Amitiés,
                         Nicolas

I suspect that question is partially addressed to me, as it may relate with #11115?

I didn't look at the patch. But if you mean to make .zero() and .one() a cached method of the parent class of a category, then in fact #11115 is needed in order to make the cache work on those parent structures that do not allow attribute assignment.

Oops, this is going far beyond what I expected! I just meant to add
TestSuite, and skip tests not related to zero / one. Now, this is not
wasted time, so thanks! One should just be careful that this does not
overlap with changes by Simon.

Cheers,

I don't have the time to verify whether there is an overlap. But: *If* there is an overlap then it is with #9944 or #9138. These two tickets try to make all rings use the category framework properly, and in some cases it also provides them with the new coercion model.

If what you do is about something else but rings, then it is very likely that there is no overlap.

Best regards,

Simon
