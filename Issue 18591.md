I feel rather guilty, as all that this branch does is steal networkx functions. With it we can export graphs to several file formats, using the `networkx.write_*` functions.

Hello,

The patchbot reports compilation errors associated with ticket #18746. I don't know why...
Actually I have the same issue when I try to compile my develop branch, and so I'm currently unable to test this patch.

Concerning this ticket. Don't feel guilty to steal networkx. It is very useful and we will certainly also have to do the same for reading graphs from file.

I suggest to change the way you guess the file format with something like:

```
for ext in formats:
    if filename.endswith('.'+ext):
        break
finally:
    raise ...
```

With networkx it is possible to give extension like `.edgelist.gz` in which case the file should be compressed (at least with version 1.9.1, but we only have 1.8.1). See https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.readwrite.edgelist.write_edgelist.html

David.

Hellooooo!

I have a little trouble understanding the goal of this ticket: would you like to have only one standard function to save graphs, instead of calling different NetworkX functions, right? Because, for instance, if I want to save a file in adjlist format I can simply type:


```
import networkx
networkx.write_adjlist(G, path)

```

instead of using this new function.

In any case, I have tried to compile this code, both with `make` and with `make distclean && make`, and it works! Some small suggestions:

* could you make a test that checks if the output is correct?

* "the format is ‘guessed’ from the extension ..." maybe it is better to say "the format is the extension", because you do not guess, you simply use the extension.

* I would add a link to the NetworkX manual (!http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/readwrite.html), where the different file formats are detailed.

Hello,

> Actually I have the same issue when I try to compile my develop branch, and so I'm currently unable to test this patch.

I had the same problem. Can be solved by removing all the cython cached files that you can find:


```
./src/build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions
./src/build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/home/ncohen/.Sage/src/build/cythonized/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions
./src/build/cythonized/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions
./src/build/cython_debug/cython_debug_info_sage.graphs.graph_decompositions*
./src/build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions
./local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions
```


And then it works. That's trouble for the patchbots, though.

> Concerning this ticket. Don't feel guilty to steal networkx. It is very useful and we will certainly also have to do the same for reading graphs from file.

Yep.

Why? It is longer, and does the same. None of the extensions contains a point.

> With networkx it is possible to give extension like `.edgelist.gz` in which case the file should be compressed (at least with version 1.9.1, but we only have 1.8.1). See https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.readwrite.edgelist.write_edgelist.html

So you want to add all combinations of `.edgelist.gz, edgelist.tgz,..` for all possible combinations to the dictionary of extensions? `O_o`

That's what the branch does, too. Only you may not know that those functions can be found in networkx.

I added one check, but it is unpleasant in many ways. First, the (integer) vertices become strings, and then each edge gets a label encoding a weight. Well, that's networkx...

>  * "the format is ‘guessed’ from the extension ..." maybe it is better to say "the format is the extension", because you do not guess, you simply use the extension.

How is that not a guess? Anyway, udpated.

>  * I would add a link to the NetworkX manual (!http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/readwrite.html), where the different file formats are detailed.

Done.

This method is clearly useful. It is too boring to import networkx each time you want to read/write a graph from/to a file.

By default method `networx.write_edgelist` sets parameter `data=True`. So your method produce a weighted edgelist instead of an edgelist

```
0 1 {}
```

instead of

```
0 1
```

I understand that you prefer short and fast code, but since writing to a file is slow anyway, we could spend some computation time to refine the behavior of the method.

I propose to add extend the tests in the following way. Let me know if you agree before I push a commit.

```
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: filename = tmp_filename(ext=".pajek")
sage: g.export_to_file(filename)
sage: import networkx
sage: h = Graph( networkx.read_pajek(filename)
sage: g.is_isomorphic(h)
True
sage: filename = tmp_filename(ext=".edgelist")
sage: g.export_to_file(filename, data=False)
sage: h = Graph( networkx.read_edgelist(filename)
sage: g.is_isomorphic(h)
True
```

Relying on vertex names is unfortunately not possible yet since the read method turns vertex id like `13` to `u'13'`.

I have pushed a small edit on the example. Hope it helps.

For the unicode problem, I have once used the following trick. Certainly not the best way to do it.

```
import string

if all(isinstance(u, unicode) for u in G):
    myaction = string.atoi
elif all(isinstance(u, str) for u in G):
    myaction = ZZ
else:
    myaction = lambda x:x

try:

G.relabel(perm=L, inplace=True)
