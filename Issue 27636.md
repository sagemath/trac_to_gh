We add integral curves over finite fields, tightly coupled with global function field machinery of Sage. The curves are space curves, including plane curves, in projective or affine spaces.

The main new functionalities are

- finding all closed points of a curve,

- finding all singular closed points of a curve,

- computing the delta invariant of closed points via Hamburger-Noether expansions.

Along the way, some old code in curves section of Sage is cleaned.
