# Issue 27636: Add integral curves over finite fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27873

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2019-05-26 09:16:16

We add integral curves over finite fields, tightly coupled with global function field machinery of Sage. The curves are space curves, including plane curves, in projective or affine spaces.

The main new functionalities are

- finding all closed points of a curve,

- finding all singular closed points of a curve,

- computing the delta invariant of closed points via Hamburger-Noether expansions.

Along the way, some old code in curves section of Sage is cleaned.

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Nitpick about terminology: the set of closed points of a curve over a finite field is infinite. The closed points *of degree bounded by N* form finite sets, for each N.
(ah, OK. the relevant code knows this. It's just the ticket description that's not reflecting it)

Right. Thanks for attention. I welcome more nitpicks.
