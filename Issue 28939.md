The following should give two non-empty regions:


```
sage: P = [[-2687.19, -2088.53], [-2686.81, -2084.19]]
....: V = VoronoiDiagram(P)
....: R = V.regions()
....: 
sage: R
{P(-2687.19000000000, -2088.53000000000): The empty polyhedron in RDF^0,
 P(-2686.81000000000, -2084.19000000000): A 1-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
```

This can and should be solved by fetching the incidences from cdd.

I will try to do so. This might get rid of a lot of numerical inconsistencies.
