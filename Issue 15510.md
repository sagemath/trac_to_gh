Keywords: integral, symbolic

From [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3464/integral-failing-with-segmentation-fault):


```
sage: ys=0.06+2*(x-0.0275)
sage: xs=ys/1.516
sage: i=1/(xs/(1+xs)-x/(1+x))
sage: integral(i,x)
250/121*x^2 + 423541/58564*x + 86958139/28344976*log(484*x + 5)
```


But, the same integral with boundaries:


```
sage: integral(i,x,0,0.275)
```


leads to a series of lines of the form:


```
;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also kwown as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;
```

I can confirm that this problem also occurs with the integral to 11/40.

That said, 


```
sage: i
1/((1.31926121372032*x + 0.00329815303430079)/(1.31926121372032*x + 1.00329815303430) - x/(x + 1))
```

and usually Maxima does not particularly like integrating floating point things exactly, because it sort of doesn't make sense.

```
sage: numerical_integral(i,0,0.275)
(12.325862793647284, 4.191806193893343e-11)
```
