Sage's Jupyter Kernel doesn't work with EIN: 

https://github.com/millejoh/emacs-ipython-notebook/issues/466

It seems this is mainly down to the Sage kernel not declaring its language in the kernel spec. For example, this seems to do the trick:


```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py b/src/sage/repl/ipython_kernel/install.py
index dc3dd6ed4a..1e03a1cf85 100644

However, I have actually no idea how the whole architecture works. Thus, is thee above "fix" or workaround acceptable?

In effect the language is normally stated in the "kernel.json" specification file. For python3 for example:

./local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3/kernel.json

--%<

"display_name": "Python 3",

"language": "python"

--%<

and yes, apparently, the Sagemath kernel fails to do that

According to [the docs on Kernel Specs](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kernels.html#kernel-specs):

> **language**: The name of the language of the kernel. When loading notebooks, if no matching kernelspec key (may differ across machines) is found, a kernel with a matching *language* will be used. This allows a notebook written on any Python or Julia kernel to be properly associated with the user’s Python or Julia kernel, even if they aren’t listed under the same name as the author’s.

Therefore this should probably be `language="sage"` or something like that.  `language="python"` would not be appropriate as a Sage kernel notebook does not have a good chance of working on a generic Python kernel.
