# Issue 28126: Add a python to list of packages to source install documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28363

Original creator: embray

[This page](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html) gives lists of system packages to install on common Linux distros as prerequisites for installing Sage.  E.g.,


```
# debian (Stretch or newer) / ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install binutils pixz gcc g++ gfortran make m4 perl tar \
  git patch openssl libssl-dev libz-dev bc libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libgmp-dev \
  libffi-dev libgf2x-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev curl yasm
```


Although it is mentioned in the docs that some Python is a prerequisite, it shouldn't be assumed (especially when setting up fresh VMs/containers for building Sage) that a Python is actually already installed.  So it would be convenient to add to the list.

python has already been added to `build/pkgs/{debian,arch,conda,fedora}.txt` in #29053.

#26964 will generate the command lines in the manual.
