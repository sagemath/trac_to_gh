# Issue 26710: UnionOfIntervals.__contains__ doctest tests str

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26947

It is documented that the input of `__contains__` should be a real number, yet there is this doctest:

```
            sage: 'a' in A
            False
```

This will break after #22029.

Since this test is meaningless, it should just be removed.
