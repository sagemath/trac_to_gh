# Issue 19715: Missing docstring in inject_off()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2016-01-24 18:22:38

`inject_off()` at `src/sage/ext/interactive_constructors_c.pyx` has no docstring.

This caused (now corrected) problem with docbuild, see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/4FU9LEilw5Q.

#20442 will take care of this. I left this open to wait for it.
