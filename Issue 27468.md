When building Python 2/3 the Python build system attempts to build several extension modules that are part of the stdlib, but does not fail the build if building some of those modules fails, as many of them are optional.

There are some such modules that are mandatory for Sage, so we check after the Python build that they can be imported, and force the build to fail if not:


```
echo "Testing importing of various modules..."
import_errors=false
test_modules="ctypes math hashlib crypt readline socket"
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    test_modules="$test_modules _scproxy"
fi

for module in $test_modules; do
    if $PYTHON -c "import $module"; then
        echo "$module module imported OK"
    else
        echo >&2 "$module module failed to import"
        import_errors=true
    fi
done

if $import_errors; then
    echo >&2 "Error: One or more modules failed to import."
    exit 1
fi
```


This came up recently in light of #26899, where the `zlib` module was silently failing to build on some macOS versions.  Hence, we should have also added `zlib` to this list.

It turns out also that pillow, for some reason, has a build-time dependency on the `_sqlite3` module being built properly, so we should add it as well.

Correction: It's elliptic_curves that has the sqlite3 dependency.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

I think we should also add `ssl` to this list, unless a flag is passed to Sage's `configure` explicitly requesting an SSL-less build.

That's a good idea, I think, because it avoids nasty surprises later when people try to use pip.

Actually, is `crypt` used anywhere in sage? I'm having trouble building it in #29012.

I expect some noise about ssl, but well...

hmm, isn't this buildbot broken?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-01-24 23:40:22

I get this same error on OS X.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-01-25 12:55:58

Does moving these tests to spkg-install from spkg-build fixes this?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-01-26 19:59:21

No. From earlier in the log file:

```
Could not build the ssl module!
Python requires an OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1 compatible libssl with X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host().
LibreSSL 2.6.4 and earlier do not provide the necessary APIs, https://github.com/libressl-portable/portable/issues/381
```

It works if I first install `openssl` via homebrew.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-01-26 20:12:57

that is, is actually works as it should, i.e. you cannot build a broken (ssh-less) Python any more?


---

Comment by jhpalmieri created at 2020-01-26 20:56:57

If you want to force that change, then at the very least, you have to change the documentation from saying that `openssl` is recommended to saying that it is required. You will also be adding another obstacle to installing Sage on OS X.

Sage without a functioning openssl (and thus not fully functioning pip, probably broken jupyter too) is pretty much broken, that is, it's probably more about saving potential users time.

I ventured into this mess on MacOS last year https://bugs.python.org/issue36344
and the "logic" of what's going on with openssl support made me question my own sanity :-)

But perhaps Python 3.8 is an improvement.

IMHO we'd ease the suffering of everyone wanting to build/run Sage on MacOS by telling them to use Conda or Homebrew.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-01-26 23:14:57

For this ticket, I'll change the error for a missing `_ssl` module into a warning.

On the same machine, vanilla Sage 9.1.beta1 runs the Jupyter notebook just fine, despite Python's failure to build the `ssl` module. `pip` is indeed broken, but it apparently hasn't bothered me before, so I am at least one user who can survive without a functioning `ssl` Python module.
