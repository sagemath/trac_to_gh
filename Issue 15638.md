You don't have to say `Poset(DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4]}))`, just `Poset({1:[2,3],2:[4],3:[4]})`.

See also #16892, it relates to this one. I think that you can look the code of it for you.

This was an answer to different question... (on sage-devel). To clarify, here is another example of `is_sub*`-function:

```
r1=2.0-1.0
r2=3.0-1.0
i1=1
i2=2
{i1, i2}.issubset({r1, r2})
```

This also outputs `True`. Hence it seems that `Poset({r1:[r2]}).is_subposet(Poset({i1:[i2]}))` should also return `True`. But I would like someone to confirm this.

"depends". It means a copy of Q's graph even if `P` is only one vertex. In other cases it will be optimal.

I don't like the fact that `is_subposet`, which is likely to be the first encountered method for this type of behavior, is caring about the element labels. Even more so that there is not any part of the documentation which suggests that it looks at labels. So you need to rework the documentation.

I cannot say that I agree with you, though there is a mistake in the note. The first sentence should be changed to: "This method does not check whether the poset is *isomorphic* to a subposet of ``other``, but only if [...]".

> (and the `is_subgraph` and "induced" in graph theory might carry a slightly different meaning than I'm used to when looking at posets)


The meaning is the same. Though this function should *not* check by default that it is an *induced* subposet. It should check whether it is a subposet, e.g.: the antichain is a subposet of any poset with the same elements.

Futhermore:

```
sage: A = posets.ChainPoset(5)
sage: A.is_subposet(A)
False
```

Hey nonononnoo why would you convert everything to facade? These non-facade posets are not something I would ever want to work with, but the reason for them is that these people want the elements to BELONG to this specific poset, and to be different from anything that does not belong to the same poset.

This may be a stupid idea but you should not go against it in this specific function. Either they are removed or they stay, but their specifications should be respected.

```
sage: P1 = Poset({1:[2]},facade=False)
sage: P2 = Poset({1:[]},facade=False)
sage: [x in P1 for x in P2]
[False]

So P2 should not be a subposet of P1.

This is one possibility. I am just wondering about existing `is_subgraph()` and planned `is_sublattice()`; naming convention should be unified. Also this definition is logical in a sense that from `Q=P.subposet(...whatever...)` you will always get `Q.is_subset(P)` returning `True`.

The link ​http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/download/v16i1r142/pdf seems to talk about isomorphic subposets.

Maybe we should write `.extensions()` and have `.is_weak_subposet()` be a poset that is induced subposet of some extension? That is the terminology used by *Enumerative Combinatorics*.

Travis, comments? At least I must think over a night about this.

Resolved a conflict, made to work with lattices also. Should be OK now.

Hello Jori,

I do not understand the point of the line `if not hasattr(other, 'hasse_diagram'):`. Given that you call `subposet` and `.hasse_diagram` on `other` anyway your code will raise an exception whenever those methods are not available.

As you wish, changed that.

Now `P.is_induced_subposet('junk')` will say `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '_is_facade'`. A slightly confusing to a user, but should not be that hard to track the error.

(Quite many Sage functions give strange errors from wrong input... At least this won't be first one.)

Hello Jori,

As you seem to care about this message, I pused a commit at public/15875 that will raise a slightly more meaningful error message when the input is bad. Add it if you like it, ignore it if you do not.

The probability of users giving this function bad input would be much lower if the function you add had an 'INPUT' section explaining what exactly it expects.

Thanks. Added that.

Hmm... Maybe I should go through functions and add `INPUT` sections.

This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?

Yo,

> Hmm... Maybe I should go through functions and add `INPUT` sections.


Could you add one at least in this function that you add here?

> This patch contains a non-relating line that corrects an indentation bug in `dilworth_decomposition()`. OK to add here?


No prob.

About the commit: [please do not change anything as it is not important], but notice that instead of adding my commit on your branch (with cherry-pick, for instance) you apparently applied the changes manually (or did something else that I cannot guess), which has as a side-effect that you became the committer+author of my changes.

Please don't change anything as it is not important, I am just giving you a side-effect of the procedure you followed to use my commit.
