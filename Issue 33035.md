Much more work to do from the output I get. Constructs like

```
`some text <https://someadress>`_
```

work fine but

```
`this text <:trac:`12345`>`_
```

doesn't at all. It displays `thistext <:trac:>`_` in italics. The lack of space between `this` and `text` is not a mistake, it is really not present in the output. The final underscore may not be in italics but that's hard to establish and it shouldn't be visible in the first place.

`:trac:` is just an example, `:wikipedia:` behaves the same way and I expect all handles will be the same. Whatever the correct thing to do is, we will have to comb the whole thing to update the syntax.
