The changes in `build/` and `pkgs/` are not good because they are intended to be readable also by themselves, without running them through our Sphinx docbuild. For example, the `pkgs/*/README.rst` appear on PyPI.

Perhaps these substitutions can be made in the `src/doc/bootstrap` script

Upgrade to sphinx 4.3.1 (#32968) is currently being merged by Volker and will be in the next beta. So this ticket will need rebasing on top of it. And I am surprised you don't seem to need https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=fc84f82f52b6f05f512cb359ec7c100f93cf8841 - but looking more closely, all your work with changing external references around may be helping with that. We may need careful navigating around that line.

Yes, I'm aware. This was tested and needs to be merged on top of that. I will rebase after the next beta.

Note that these warnings will probably be disabled by default in Sphinx 4.4.1: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/10126

OK, it looks like stuff like `#ticket_number` has to go. In fact from the output I saw earlier today, we need to move from `:trac:`ticket/29023`` to `:trac:`29023``.

I am not saying it should be the definitive form, especially in the stuff I changed in the thematic_tutorials, but it now builds both the html and the pdf without a hitch. 

Pitty I am doing all that remotely, I will have to wait tomorrow to see what it looks like.

`@`klee copying you because you care about the doc so you can give us your opinion about how it looks like after the upgrade and whether we need to improve our output.

I get this error when `make`: 

  `sed: -I or -i may not be used with stdin`

My system is macOS Monterey.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-02-21 05:47:44

Yes, `sed -i` is not portable; so `sed` should instead be used in a pipe


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-02-21 05:48:43

Also comment:3 is not fully addressed yet - the changes to `pkgs/*/README.rst` are not good


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-02-21 06:32:05

Yes, I should have known `sed -i` would cause trouble. On the other hand I should be able to revert those `build/*/*.rst` and `pkgs/*/*.rst` changes by using the same formula. Although it gets a bit annoying when it involves other stuff than trac.

OK, this builds here. I piped `sed` as suggested so it should be more portable and I addressed comment:3 by reverting the changes in question completely. The changes to `README.rst` were not useful as they are not used when building the documentation. The changes to `SPKG.rst` files can be applied on the fly when bootstrapping `src/doc/en/reference/spkg/` like I do with all other such files.

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-02-21 08:59:25

I don't think the changes to `sage-spkg-info` made sense either. Like for `README.rst` they are meant to be readable, they are normally issued as part of the configure process. Any such statement should be converted during bootstrap as well.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-02-21 20:11:35

Much more work to do from the output I get. Constructs like

```
`some text <https://someadress>`_
```

work fine but

```
`this text <:trac:`12345`>`_
```

doesn't at all. It displays `thistext <:trac:>`_` in italics. The lack of space between `this` and `text` is not a mistake, it is really not present in the output. The final underscore may not be in italics but that's hard to establish and it shouldn't be visible in the first place.

`:trac:` is just an example, `:wikipedia:` behaves the same way and I expect all handles will be the same. Whatever the correct thing to do is, we will have to comb the whole thing to update the syntax.

I am not sure who tried to mix extlinks and rst caption links first. But it could hardly work, extlinks are already providing a, pre-formatted, captioned link. If you want a different caption, you shouldn't use extlinks - which of course currently gives us an error.

Following sphinx documentation, structure like 

```
`this text <:trac:`12345`>`_
```

need to be replaced by 

```
:trac:`this text <12345>`
```

The html output is good, and I put some samples on the branch. I am checking that pdf builds with this as well before going any further.

HTMLs and PDFs build fine on macOS. 

But updated links need to be checked. I found one error:

It is still a work in progress, I'll get to that one shortly. If you spot some other weird stuff that is not coming from a file touched by this branch, I'd be glad for the report.

If I'm not mistaken this has been fixed:

Done a build (html and pdf), but I won't be able to see the resulting documents before about 9am NZ time which is in a bit less than 13 hours.

Of particular interest are
* `src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py` where the original was missing an ending `"` and I am not sure if it will parse properly or need to be replaced by codes.
* `src/sage/sat/solvers/satsolver.pyx` where I changed slightly the caption.

Also I saw `:meth:` in `src/sage/knots/knotinfo.py` and several other files but I cannot find where it is defined. Can someone tell me more about it?

It is a role defined in the Python domain. Hence it is defined in Sphinx. See here:

It looks fine.

It looks better.

Overall, I am positive on the ticket. We just need to wait for the next beta to resolve merge conflicts.

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-02-23 06:12:19

There shouldn't be any conflict. I am testing this as is in sage-on-gentoo on Volker's merging branch (which includes #33309) and there are no conflicts. If you think a ticket will conflict with this one, I'd like to know about it.
