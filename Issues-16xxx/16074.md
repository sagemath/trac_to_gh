@tscrim: I have not been able to fix the use of metaclass in 

```
* src/sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py
* src/sage/algebras/commutative_dga.py
* src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/graded_ring_element.py
```
The expected python3 replacement is

```
from six import add_metaclass

@add_metaclass(name_of_metaclass)
class something
```
But this does not work for the three mentioned files.

The problem is the decorator, because it works in 2 steps:

1. The class is created the usual way.

2. The decorator modifies the class to have a new metaclass.

The problem is that step 1. already fails, so the decorator cannot do anything.

There are some other files with `__metaclass__`, such as `src/sage/structure/unique_representation.py`. Should I try to fix these on this ticket too or is there a different ticket?

Done. The main effort here is fixing `sage.misc.six.with_metaclass` (the first of 3 commits).

After this ticket, there is no remaining Sage code using `__metaclass__`. Some doctests still use `__metaclass__`, but I suggest to fix that later.

I wanted to submit these fixes to `with_metaclass` upstream to `six`. However, when looking at the original `six` code, I understood what was going wrong and it is really simple.

I also realized that it was #18503 which is the cause for the metaclass breakage. In other words, #18503 did the wrong thing and actually made everything more complicated.

It turns out that #18503 can be fixed in a much simpler way, see https://github.com/benjaminp/six/pull/191 and then this issue (#16074) simply does not occur.
