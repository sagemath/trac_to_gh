A few minor/trivial comments/questions:
- I don't think the change from `Sets` to `Monoids` in the doctest for `SetMorphism.__init__()` is correct.  The numerator function is neither a morphism of additive monoids (`numerator(1/2) + numerator(2) != numerator(1/2 + 2)`) nor of multiplicative monoids (`numerator(1/2) * numerator(2) != numerator(1/2 * 2)`).
- What is the reason for changing some docstrings to start with `r"""` instead of `"""`?  If I'm not mistaken, this is only needed if the string contains backslashes.  There don't seem to be any backslashes in the ones where you added the `r`; on the other hand, the docstring of `register_as_conversion()` does have one (so either it should start with `r"""` or the backslash in `\ZZ` should be doubled).
- I am not a native English speaker, but I think "can not" should be "cannot" in this context, and "should not it be" should be "shouldn't it be" or "should it not be".  Also, not using the shortened forms in these cases sounds a bit artificial in my opinion.  Anyway, this is really starting to descend into trivialities...

I have tried to answer your comments.

* put back sets instead of monoids
* put `r"""` exactly when needed
* wrote "cannot"

Done some more little things

* added one more doc to another function
* turn raise statements into py3 syntax

As my sage seems to be broken right now, I was not able to test.
