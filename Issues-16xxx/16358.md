I would say that this was broken when #16237 was fixed. The cool news is that it did not make it inside of the stable release `:-P`

....

On the other hand all the doctests of `automorphism_group` were not changed, so it cannot be #16237. So it may have been wrong since the beginning ? `O_o`

Before this branch is applied :

```
sage: BlockDesign(4,[[0,1,2,3],[1,2,3]],test=False).automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [()]
```

After:

```
sage: BlockDesign(4,[[0,1,2,3],[1,2,3]],test=False).automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(3,4), (2,3)]
```

Aaaaaaaand it turns out that writing this patch did not even force me to change any doctest.. So it was just bad luck that the automorphism groups used in the docstrings were EXACTLY the automorphism groups of the duals (like the Fano plane... `:-P`) `:-P`

Nathann

P.S. : this also adds some potentially useful keyword in is_block_design. That's how I found this bug.

Hey guys... Sorry to bug you but this is a one-line bugfix, and in the meantime Sage really returns wrong results... `:-/`

Aaaaaaand #16367 is also a very simple improvement that does help a lot when playing with designs...
