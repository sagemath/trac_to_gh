Currently `UniqueFactory`'s unpickling protocol is to call `generic_factory_unpickle()`, whose first argument *must* be an instance of `UniqueFactory`. However we might want to change the object in the global namespace, let's say to a function, and then we will not be able to unpickle any  thing beforehand (`register_unpickle_override` can not help here because the pickle info is `(UniqueFactory`, `generic_factory_unpickle)`). Came up in #15289.

Travis, you have been inserted as "Author", but I think you did not provide code. So, I took the liberty to replace your name by mine, and attach a branch. The new doctest demonstrates how to replace a unique factory by unique representation and correctly unpickle.
