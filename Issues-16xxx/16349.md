Currently `UniqueFactory`'s unpickling protocol is to call `generic_factory_unpickle()`, whose first argument *must* be an instance of `UniqueFactory`. However we might want to change the object in the global namespace, let's say to a function, and then we will not be able to unpickle any  thing beforehand (`register_unpickle_override` can not help here because the pickle info is `(UniqueFactory`, `generic_factory_unpickle)`). Came up in #15289.
