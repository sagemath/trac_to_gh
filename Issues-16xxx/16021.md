Okay, after two days trying to get the patchbot to run on my machine to test this ticket I gave up (you can see the failed attempts by clicking on the red circle at the top of this ticket).

I tested all files on my computer, it resulted in two failures which are not related to this ticket. Thus, pass ! And sorry for the delay.
