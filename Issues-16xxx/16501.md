Instead of grepping the output of `tar tf -`, I would prefer a simple shell script along the lines of

```sh
# Find the unique subdirectory name
PKG_SUBDIR=""
for d in *; do
    if [ -d "$d" ]; then
        if [ -z "$PKG_SUBDIR" ]; then
            PKG_SUBDIR="$d"
        else
            echo >&2 "Multiple directories in package, no idea what to do..."
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
done
if [ -z "$PKG_SUBDIR" ]; then
    echo >&2 "No directory found in package, no idea what to do..."
    exit 1
fi
cd "$PKG_SUBDIR" || exit $?
```

This also deals with the case that there are multiple directories, and there are less worries about portability of `tar tf -`.
