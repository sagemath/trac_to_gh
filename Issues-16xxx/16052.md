For progress on making all doctests pass, see #26212

This meta-ticket tracks those tickets for changing the Sage library that did not go into stage 1 (ticket:15980).

Some reasons for assigning tasks to stage 2:
* The code can run on Python 2 only with the support of imported "compatibility" libraries. [copied from description] 
  Maybe we have to check the licenses of the used compatibility libraries.
* The tasks are usually more complicated. The approach may not be obvious or uncontroversial.
* To make progress we need a Python 3.3 test environment for them.
