Build oval from conics in Desarguesian projective plane and use MILP to look for ovals in non-Desarguesian ones.

We use it to speed up some of the Wilson construction which requires an oval.

To be rewritten over #16553

Depends on #16500
Depends on #16553

Ahem. Vincent, I thank  you for the feature but the code really needs some reorganization `:-P`

First, why wouldn't the system of coordinates be provided by `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` when you create one ? Clearly getting the "coordinates" of the points can be useful, and the only reason why it is not already the case is that `BlockDesign` only supports integers as a ground set. But you could return the dictionary along with the projective plane, couldn't you ?

additional question : is the `_desarguesian_projective_plane_coordinates` properly defined anyway ? Or is that why it is just an internal function ?

Similarly, the oval functions have no reason to return integers. They can just return the triples of coordinates.

Besides, we can't just dump "Oval functions" like that in `block_designs.py`. And... Well, though you were not the worst in the crowd, I think I can easily gather 50+ emails that were exchanged just because I created a `ProjectivePlane` function which returned a desarguesian projective plane. How can you now create a function as well defined as `OvalInDesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign` ?.. `:-P`

doable... You would like the answer of `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` to be a pair `(projective plane, coordinates)`. But not very standardized with comparison to BIBD, OA, MOLS, etc.

I would rather create a class

```
class DesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign(IncidenceStructure):
    def label(self, x, y, z):
        r"""
        Return the label of the class `[x:y:z]`
        """
```
but it is too much work for this ticket.

> additional question : is the `_desarguesian_projective_plane_coordinates` properly defined anyway ? Or is that why it is just an internal function ?

No. What is well defined are the classes `[x:y:z]` which are elements of `K^3 \ {0}` up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar (i.e. lines in `K^3`). The labeling choice mapping it to integers is not canonical.

> Similarly, the oval functions have no reason to return integers. They can just return the triples of coordinates.

Right, but in that case there is no need for a function:

```
sage: K = GF(17)
sage: oval = [(t,t^2,K.one()) for t in K] + [(K.zero(),K.one(),K.zero())]
```

> Besides, we can't just dump "Oval functions" like that in `block_designs.py`. And... Well, though you were not the worst in the crowd, I think I can easily gather 50+ emails that were exchanged just because I created a `ProjectivePlane` function which returned a desarguesian projective plane. How can you now create a function as well defined as `OvalInDesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign` ?.. `:-P`

The name is not quite appropriate for sure. I can call them `PointOfTheConic_t_t2_1` if you prefer but if we would return triple of elements of `GF(q)` then there is no need for these functions.

I will create a decorator `@output_type_depends_on_input` especially for you!

If I do this I would rewrite partly the `IncidenceStructure` class (especially hide the attributes). For a class `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` there is no need to store the points or the blocks. It will be as fast as you whish to do it on the fly...

But then comes from the problem with labels... should we steal the implementation that is in graph?

I was dump and wikipedia was my friend in that particular case.

For example:

```
sage: K = GF(3)
sage: P = designs.ProjectivePlane(K)
sage: R.<t> = K[t]
sage: oval = P.points_of_parametrized_curve((t,t^2))
```

We need a category of functions whose output depends on the input and combinatorial maps from there to everywhere else.

> If I do this I would rewrite partly the `IncidenceStructure` class (especially hide the attributes).

Honestly, if you feel like working on `IncidenceStructure` we can rewrite it together. Up to now I have been alternatively 1) scared to use it because of the bugs I already found there 2) not sufficienty stuck to need to rewrite it.

> For a class `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` there is no need to store the points or the blocks. It will be as fast as you whish to do it on the fly...

Ahahahah. Well, if you want to get better performances on this kind of stuff ...

`T_T`

Well. If we .... sigh .... let block designs have a different ground set, we should do it in such a way that we can work with integers when we want to without being in trouble. Perhaps it just means that we need to have "integer" counterparts to every "labelled" function.

HMmmmm... I have no idea if it is the  right place `O_o`
