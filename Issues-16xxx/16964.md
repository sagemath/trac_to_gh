When computing the variety of some ideal, then excessive amounts of time are apparently spent sorting the solutions. (In one example, the variety was essentially computed in 7½ hours but the sorting wasn't finished even 1½ hours after that.) This is due to the fact that comparison between complex algebraic numbers is done lexicographically, which means that quite often the real parts of complex conjugate numbers will have to be compared for equality, which can be a very costly operation.

Originally the computation even resulted in a Pari exception (“not enough precomputed primes”). This no longer occurs (since the pari upgrade from #15767). So the focus of this ticket is now the excessive amount of time required for comparisons, even without an exception.

This was sage 6.3 on Gentoo. With current develop (6.4.beta2) at least it doesn't fail as “quickly”: where the previous computation was 8 hours all in all up to the exception, my patched version without sorting took 7½ hours to compute the list, and after that sage has now been busy sorting that list for 1½ hours and still isn't done. I'll report back when it is, or when it gave up, but I'd say some need for action remains, even if the exception no longer occurs in this form.

Here is a reproducing example which at least demonstrates that comparisons take *way* longer than they should:

```
sage: r = QQ[x](69721504*x^8 + 251777664*x^6 + 329532012*x^4 + 184429548*x^2 + 37344321).roots(QQbar, False)
sage: r
[-0.0221204634374360? - 1.090991904211621?*I,
 -0.0221204634374360? + 1.090991904211621?*I,
 -0.8088604911480535?*I,
 -0.7598602580415435?*I,
 0.7598602580415435?*I,
 0.8088604911480535?*I,
 0.0221204634374360? - 1.090991904211621?*I,
 0.0221204634374360? + 1.090991904211621?*I]
sage: [r[0], r[1]].sort()
```

This is because the comparison of the real parts takes like forever. Which in turn is because the computation of its minimal polynomial takes forever.

Looking at the set of all zeros, I can see that there are 4 clearly distinct real parts, and each comes with a pair of conjugate solutions since the polynomial has real coefficients. This is enough to conclude that if the intervals for two real parts overlap, then they must be equal and I don't have to do an exact computation for this. Should we try to implement some of this reasoning as a special case for `AlgebraicNumber.__cmp__`, for the case where the descriptor is exact and the minpoly is the same?

Looking for ways to address this, I noticed that the a lot of time apparently is spent inside

```
class ANBinaryExpr(ANDescr):
    ⋮
    def exactify(self):
        ⋮
            gen = left._exact_field().union(right._exact_field())
        ⋮
```

I wonder whether we can avoid that union for the case where both fields have the same defining polynomial. I wonder whether we can assume that the root of the field will form a [power basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_number_field#Power_basis), and if so, whether there is any reasonably cheap way to find the conversion between different power bases, so we could express one root in terms of another.

Since I don't have any good ideas how to achieve this, my best idea still is tacking this at the `__cmp__` level, but if anyone has an idea for solving this more generic issue, that would be really great since it would help other computations as well. So I'm sharing my thoughts.

Here is what I've tried and discarded, so you can avoid that same cul de sac. I started by writing down a generic linear combination w = a₀ + a₁z + a₂z² + … and then computed p(w) reduced by p(z), where p is the polynomial of the field. This gives a polynomial in z, and if enough powers of z are irrational then all the coefficients have to be zero if w is a root and the a_i are to be rational. So this gave me d conditions on these a₀ through a_{d-1}, which I could combine into an ideal and try to compute a variety. But that variety computation takes like forever in the above example, so this generic approach of finding other roots is not feasible in this fashion. Been there, tried that and discarded it.

Here is my first stab at the approach outlined in [comment:3](#comment:3). If you have a nicer way to handle things, feel free to suggest an alternative.

As it is, I consider my code not particularly beautiful, and perhaps not the best solution either, but it is *way* better than the current state of affairs, and since we have other things depending on this, e.g. #14239, I'd like to see this merged pretty soon and possible improvements dealt with in a later ticket.

Have you found time for a closer look? Since this is currently the only ticket in the review queue with priority critical, perhaps we should try to get this into Sage 6.5?

Hello,

This improvement is really cool!

EDIT: the thing below is basically one part of [comment:9](#comment:9)...

Couldn't we do a little bit better? In some cases we might identify numerically pairs of conjugated roots (and possibly one real root) and still be able to decide which one is which. There exists polynomials whose roots have the same real part:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: P = x^4 - 4*x^3 + 9*x^2 - 10*x + 5
sage: P.roots(CC,False)
[1.00000000000000 - 1.61803398874989*I,
 1.00000000000000 - 0.618033988749895*I,
 1.00000000000000 + 0.618033988749895*I,
 1.00000000000000 + 1.61803398874989*I]
```
With the implementation proposed in this ticket, the comparison of the roots of the above polynomial falls back to the generic implementation. We could at least compare the conjugated ones without exactification of the real part. But we can leave that for a further ticket.

Vincent

sorry for that... Your version is much simpler by the way!

I choose a more meaningful test. Could you have a look?

As a consequence of your changes, we get great improvements on comparing rationals!!

new timings

```
sage: a = QQbar(1/3)
sage: b = QQbar(1/2)
sage: %timeit cmp(a,b)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 881 ns per loop
```

old timings

```
sage: a = QQbar(1/3)
sage: b = QQbar(1/2)
sage: %timeit cmp(a,b)
10000 loops, best of 3: 34.4 µs per loop
```
This is completely crazy.

If you are happy with my changes you can set to positive review.

I like it. Thanks for the review!

The speed gain for the rational numbers appear to be due to the fact that we no longer have to construct an algebraic number representation for the real part. `a._value.real()` is a lot faster than `a.real()`:

```
sage: %timeit a._value.real()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 201 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a.real()
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.7 µs per loop
```

(I still hope that someone, some day, will make all this work here obsolete by coming up with a better way to compare QQbar elements even if they don't share a minpoly. No idea how, though.)

Up to now I had assumed that most arithmetic in QQbar would eventually be performed using resultants. But it seems I was mistaken.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p1 = x^5 + 6*x^4 - 42*x^3 - 142*x^2 + 467*x + 422
sage: p2 = p1((x-1)^2)
sage: r1 = QQbar.polynomial_root(p2, CIF(1, (2.1, 2.2)))
sage: r2 = QQbar.polynomial_root(p2, CIF(1, (2.8, 2.9)))
sage: a,b = polygens(QQ, 'a,b')
sage: %time p3 = r1.minpoly()(a + b).resultant(r2.minpoly()(b), b)
CPU times: user 62 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 62 ms
Wall time: 68 ms
sage: [r for f in p3.factor()
....:  for r in f[0].univariate_polynomial().roots(QQbar, False)
....:  if r._value.overlaps(r1._value - r2._value)]
[-0.7266314748516305?*I]
sage: %time p4 = (r1 - r2).minpoly()
```

One possible root of `p3` is `b=r2` and `a+b=r1` which means `a=r1-r2`. So eliminating `b` we get a (reducible, not minimal) polynomial in `a` which has that difference as one of its roots, just as you indicated. I try to identify that by looking at the roots `r` of the factors `f`, checking whether they overlap the numeric interval. The single result I obtain has zero real part, thus indicating that we should sort by imaginary part.

I lost patience waiting for that final result of `p4`, which should do pretty much the same thing in my opinion. My question is, why is it computed the way it is? Why do arithmetic operators for algebraic numbers compute some costly unions of number fields (which I believe is what they are doing), instead of using resultants to describe their results? And should we start some major rewrite effort to change that, i.e. to base most if not all arithmetic operations on resultants?

If that were the case, numeric refinement wouldn't be able to help choosing the right factor. Should we perhaps not factor the resultant polynomial, but instead compute roots for the fully expanded form?

I get the impression that this might trigger some major work. I hope that the reviewed changes can land as they are, while we investigate (in some other branch) how to tackle this more generic approach.
