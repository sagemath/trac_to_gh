(we are talking about stuff migrating from https://github.com/ingolfured/sageproject)

I am skeptical about the change to `src/sage/numerical/backends/ppl_backend.pyx`.
Why do you need this?! PPL does not work with floats, it works with arbitrary precision integers!

A couple of things:

`# optional - CVXOPT` tags should not be there, as CVXOPT is a standard part of Sage.

check the copyright notices on your .pxd and .pyx files - some of them list Nathann as the author :-)

Yo !

You put cvxopt before gurobi in the ordering of LP solvers: this list is meant to be "use the fastest solver available installed on this computer". Is CVXOPT faster than Gurobi ?

Besides:

1) It is useless to put anything after a solver which is installed by default

2) PPL cannot really be a "default solver" as it misses the important feature of being able to solve integer linear programs.

huh?

We have discussed this in April:
let me quote your email dated 22.04.14:

Just read the code :\n\n```\n    if solver is None:\n\n        if default_solver is not None:\n            return default_solver\n\n        else:\n            for s in [\"Cplex\", \"Cvxopt\", \"Gurobi\", \"Coin\", \"Glpk\", \"Ppl\"]:\n                try:\n                    default_mip_solver(s)\n                    return s\n                except ValueError:\n                    pass\n```\n\nIf CPLEX is available, Cplex will be used. If CVXOPT is available, it will be used.

No, this list is a linear ordering that makes Sage's default the first solver that can be called and that appears in the list. If CVXOPT is the second, and as it is available by default, then none of the others will ever become the default. And unless you tell me that CVXOPT is faster than gurobi it should appear afterwards.

I don't see what you intend by quoting me against myself. Just read the code :

```
    if solver is None:

        if default_solver is not None:
            return default_solver

        else:
            for s in ["Cplex", "Cvxopt", "Gurobi", "Coin", "Glpk", "Ppl"]:
                try:
                    default_mip_solver(s)
                    return s
                except ValueError:
                    pass
```

If CPLEX is available, Cplex will be used. If CVXOPT is available, it will be used. And CVXOPT is always available, so none of the others LP will ever be used.

If you want to be able to make CVXOPT the default solver all you need is this part of your branch

```
    elif solver == "Cvxopt":
        try:
            from sage.numerical.backends.cvxopt_backend import CVXOPTBackend
            default_solver = solver
        except ImportError:
            raise ValueError("CVXOPT is not available. Please refer to the documentation to install it.")
```

Touching the list changes the "automatically defined" default solver of Sage. And as the code shows, by puting cvxopt second you may as well remove anything that appears after it. Similarly, it's useless to put anything after Glpk. In the current state the function will only test Cplex and CVXOPT.

and another easy to fix thing:

```
sage -t src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx", line 913, in sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.default_mip_solver
Failed example:
    default_mip_solver("Yeahhhhhhhhhhh")
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: 'solver' should be set to 'GLPK', 'Coin', 'CPLEX', 'CVXOPT', 'Gurobi', 'PPL' or None.
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/scratch/dimpase/sage/sage-6.3.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 480, in _run
        self.execute(example, compiled, test.globs)
      File "/home/scratch/dimpase/sage/sage-6.3.beta2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 839, in execute
        exec compiled in globs
      File "<doctest sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.default_mip_solver[3]>", line 1, in <module>
        default_mip_solver("Yeahhhhhhhhhhh")
      File "generic_backend.pyx", line 975, in sage.numerical.backends.generic_backend.default_mip_solver (build/cythonized/sage/numerical/backends/generic_backend.c:7373)
    ValueError: 'solver' should be set to 'GLPK', 'Coin', 'CPLEX', 'Gurobi', 'CVXOPT', 'PPL' or None.
```
here the problem is that the output does not match the doctest, as in the doctest the order of solvers is different : CVXOPT and Gurobi are swapped.

The best way to create a proper docstring is to run the command, in this case `default_mip_solver("Yeahhhhhhhhhhh")`, at the Sage prompt and then paste the output into the source.

The latest commit (​fb45d8b	in generic_backend, ppl fixed, test added and another test fixed
) fixes all the problems, except this one (indeed, it doesn't even touch the cvxopt backend). Please look into it.

set_variable_type is cont. by default and cannot be changed. I fixed the doc for that.

yeah, this line in the doctest

```

```
should be removed, as it is just output of the log of the convergence towards a solution, nothing important.
