The way caching is implemented in `EllipticCurve_generic` causes some trouble
at #11895. Several methods, such as `_multiple_x_numerator`,
`_multiple_x_denominator`, `division_polynomial_0` should be rewritten such that they do not use a `cache` parameter anymore.

Looks good to me; now running doctests.

I'm just slightly worried that some of the methods may cache too much, because the caching key depends on `x`, which can just be a concrete *x*-value rather than a polynomial variable.  However, this already seems to have been the case before this ticket, so maybe we can keep it like that for now.
