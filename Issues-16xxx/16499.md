There is a lot to save by not trying to build an Orthogonal Array when ... we already know that we are going to fail.

This is the case when `orthogonal_arrays(k-1,n)` was called and returned "Unknown" : there is no point in trying to build an `orthogonal_array(k,n)` later.

This can be cheaply fixed by querying the cache before trying to build the design.

The "clean" fix would be to introduce a `is_available` along with the `existence` parameter, but this interface will probably change very soon so it is not the right time to touch all functions and deal with all combinations of existence/available/etc because of that. Besides, the current fix already does the job quite well.

This will all become an Object Oriented Hell quite soon anyway .... `:-P`

Oh. And this patch also renames some private methods in a more "object oriented" way. Maybe it will become a real object, someday. Or be rewritten in Cython. 

Life.

Hi Nathann,

I propose to
- move this over #16423
- remove the `# long time` for the `MOLS_table` test
- change 15 to 20 or 30 in the `MOLS_table`
Timings are now

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import MOLS_table
sage: from time import time
sage: t0 = time(); MOLS_table(30); t1 = time()
...
sage: print t1 - t0
3.6996819973
```
Impressive!

Vincent

Yo !

> - move this over #16423

I will do this as soon as #16423 is reviewed.

> - remove the `# long time` for the `MOLS_table` test
> - change 15 to 20 or 30 in the `MOLS_table`

No need. We will have to set it back the way it is now as soon as #16500 is reviewed, unless there is a way to save time there.

Too bad it will not last `:-/`
