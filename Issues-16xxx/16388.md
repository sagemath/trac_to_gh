Oh, my mistake. Those modifications cannot hurt more than the patch did before you wrote this commit. Sorry for that.

I hope I had conflicts in mind when I first wrote it. Otherwise I will pay it.

The terminology is not understandable:

- MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
- (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)

good luck for your future merges... (now you are used to it ;-P)

Yo !

> The terminology is not understandable:

I just sent you "Combinatorial Designs: Construction and Analysis" from Douglas Stinson which uses `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD`, `TD(k,n)` and `OA(k,n)`. I believed that the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs did the same but they actually write `BIBD(v,k,lambda)`. Their purpose was probably to unify notations, given that `(v,k,lambda)-BIBD` is a pretty common :

http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/repeated11.pdf
http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

You will also find other occurrences of this naming in the references of the Handbook.

Othey guys say 2-(v,k,lambda) design.

> - MOLS(n,k) but TD(k,n)
> - (v,k,lambda)-BIBD but TD(v,k,lambda)

Two remarks :
- `MOLS(n,k)` does not appear in Sage's code
- It is true that the constructor of MOLS takes first a n then an k as input. It is true that it can lead to mistakes, and perhaps we should change it.
- If you insist on using BIBD(v,k,lambda) it can be done but it has to be a global change as some pages, eg http://sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/bibd.html already use this terminology. Same for PBD.
