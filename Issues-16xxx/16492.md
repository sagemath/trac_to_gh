In #16055, I was trying to create a unital "magmatic" algebra `A` and pass a base ring to `Parent`. This then tries to setup the default coercion from the base ring to `A`, which fails because `A` is not in `Rings()`.

```
sage: from sage.categories.magmatic_algebras import MagmaticAlgebras
sage: class A(Parent):
....:     def __init__(self, R):
....:         Parent.__init__(self, base=R, category=MagmaticAlgebras(R).Unital())
....:         
sage: A(QQ)

Why is it a problem?  The change in #19225 that fixes this particular error is replacing `Rings()` by `Sets()`; this doesn't break anything as far as I can see.  

Of course, if you really want you can use something like `MagmasAndAdditiveMagmas().Distributive().AdditiveAssociative().AdditiveCommutative().AdditiveUnital().AdditiveInverse().Unital()` for the `Hom` set, but then perhaps the next type of object someone wants to create may not have additive inverses, for example.
