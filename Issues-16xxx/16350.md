The Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS, http://www.pathname.com/fhs/) advises `*/lib` as a place for libraries but in version 2.3 allows other `*/lib*` paths. The package install script `configure` loads the `site-config` script which on SuSE and other systems assumes that, if no `execdir` is given, `*/lib` should be used. This leads to doctest fails in `dev/sagedev.py` caused by mismatch between `GIT_EXEC_PATH` in `bin/sage-env` (which hardcodes `local/libexec`) and the actual `execdir` used in the git install (which is `local/lib` if it's not preset with the configure command), introduced with #15901.

Solutions are checking for `lib/git-core` or explicitly specifying `configure --libexecdir="$SAGE_LOCAL"/libexec` in git's `spkg-install`.

We do the latter here.

<a id='comment:4'></a>It probably happens when `autoconf` is run, because the path is hardcoded in the `Makefile`. I can reproduce it with a git-2.0.0 version outside of Sage. This looks like the relevant log, i.e., not a wrong setting, but the failure of an env var being set:

```
config.log:| # If user did not specify libexecdir, set the correct target:
config.log:| # Nor FHS nor openSUSE allow prefix/libexec. Let's default to prefix/lib.
config.log:|
config.log:| if test "$libexecdir" = '${exec_prefix}/libexec' ; then
config.log:|    libexecdir='${exec_prefix}/lib'
```
But since this is official behaviour, Sage should be aware of it.

Interestingly for example, the ECL package among others installs excutables outside `bin/` too but specifies `lib` as path instead of `libexec`. So it seems both the distributions and the packages have their say in the matter, and git is unfortunate to not commit to `lib`, as it is suggested by the standard.
