Instead of using the home made `sage-spkg` for unpatched Python packages it would be simpler/better to use pip (no worries about upgrades, etc). As examples, we have the following optional packages that can be used to test the switch
- beautiful soup 
- pyopenssl
- pyqtx
- pyzmq

I guess the simplest would be to make `pip` a standard package and create the command `sage -pip`.

Then for each of the listed package in the description, the `sage-spkg` script will just raises an error explaining the new procedure

```
The packages XYZ is now handled with pip (a package manager for Python).
To install it, just do
   $ sage -pip install XYZ [extra_options]
For further informations, refer to the documentation at
http://pip.readthedocs.org
```

Another option is to redirect `sage-spkg` input to `pip` if everything else failed but I do not like that so much.

#20218 offers a middle ground--it keeps `spkg-install` (in particular since at least some packages need a little more work before it can run `pip`).  But for most Python packages the sole function of `spkg-install` is to cd into its source and run `pip`.

I think having a proper `spkg-install` script for each package, even if it's trivial, is ultimately simpler and less confusing than having different build/install paths for different kinds of packages that meet a very specific set up conditions.  Better that all packages have an `spkg-install` documenting "this is how you install this package", and not require a priori knowledge that some arbitrary package happens to be a Python module distribution.
