Instead of using the home made `sage-spkg` for unpatched Python packages it would be simpler/better to use pip (no worries about upgrades, etc). As examples, we have the following optional packages that can be used to test the switch
- beautiful soup 
- pyopenssl
- pyqtx
- pyzmq

I guess the simplest would be to make `pip` a standard package and create the command `sage -pip`.

Then for each of the listed package in the description, the `sage-spkg` script will just raises an error explaining the new procedure

```
The packages XYZ is now handled with pip (a package manager for Python).
To install it, just do
   $ sage -pip install XYZ [extra_options]
For further informations, refer to the documentation at
http://pip.readthedocs.org
```

Another option is to redirect `sage-spkg` input to `pip` if everything else failed but I do not like that so much.
