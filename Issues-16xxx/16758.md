The output of an automaton should not be feedable into a transducer (because there is none); when composing an automaton with a transducer, the result should be an automaton.

The aim would be:

```         
sage: from sage.combinat.finite_state_machine import (
....:     is_Automaton, is_Transducer)
sage: T = Transducer([(0, 0, 0, 0)], initial_states=[0])
sage: A = Automaton([(0, 0, 0)], initial_states=[0])
sage: T.composition(A, algorithm='direct')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Composition with automaton is not possible.
sage: T.composition(A, algorithm='explorative')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Composition with automaton is not possible.
sage: A.composition(A, algorithm='direct')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Composition with automaton is not possible.
sage: A.composition(A, algorithm='explorative')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Composition with automaton is not possible.
sage: is_Automaton(A.composition(T, algorithm='direct'))
True
sage: is_Automaton(A.composition(T, algorithm='explorative'))
True
```

This is now achieved by this patch.
