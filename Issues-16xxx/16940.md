We implement an an_element method for Hom spaces of vector spaces which returns a somewhat typical element in the space (instead of the boring 0 matrix!)

Hello,

Actually I think that this is a bug

```
sage: V1 = GF(2)**3
sage: V2 = GF(7)**5
sage: Hom(V1,V2)
Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations)
from 
  Vector space of dimension 3 over Finite Field of size 2
to
  Vector space of dimension 5 over Finite Field of size 7
sage: _.category()
Category of homsets of modules with basis over (finite fields
and subquotients of monoids and quotients of semigroups)
```
Don't you?

I would either open another ticket or solve it here (at the level of `FreeModuleHomspace`). In your `_an_element_` you should not worry about the `EmptySetError` being raised. The homset between free modules (over the same base ring) always contain zero and so is **never** empty!

Vincent

See #18309 for the issue about Hom.
