TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints; using the 'assume' command before evaluation *may* help (example of legal syntax is 'assume(x^2+(-4*n-2)*x+1>0)', see `assume?` for more details)
Is x^2+(-4*n-2)*x+1 positive or negative?
```
(the ODE of the Laguerre polynomials)

Keywords: **assume, maxima**

Component: **calculus**
