This worked in 6.1.1. Maybe triggered in #15306.
Note the sign of the denominator:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: p=(6*x^2 - 9*x + 5)/(-x^3 + 3*x^2 - 3*x + 1)
sage: p.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0, [6/(x - 1), 3/(x^2 - 2*x + 1), 2/(x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x - 1)])
sage: 6/(x - 1) + 3/(x^2 - 2*x + 1) + 2/(x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x - 1)
(6*x^2 - 9*x + 5)/(x^3 - 3*x^2 + 3*x - 1)
```
while in SR:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: p=(6*x^2 - 9*x + 5)/(-x^3 + 3*x^2 - 3*x + 1)
sage: p.partial_fraction()
-6/(x - 1) - 3/(x - 1)^2 - 2/(x - 1)^3
```
The minimal case, showing with odd exponents:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ['x']
sage: p=1/(-x + 1)
sage: p.partial_fraction_decomposition()
(0, [1/(x - 1)])
```

OK, I convinced myself that if the algorithm is correct in the case where the unit in the factorisation of the denominator is 1 (in which case this patch does not make a difference), then the algorithm is correct for arbitrary units if and only if the patch is applied.

As Knuth said, "I have only proved it correct, not tried it", so now running doctests.
