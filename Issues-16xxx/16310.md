branch for this ticket: u/egunawan/16310snake (currently at Sage 8.9beta3)

Enhancement to the cluster_algebra_quiver package: User can define a cluster algebra seed by entering a cluster triangulation class T of a surface. User can then compute the T-expansion of an arc or loop gamma by entering the arcs of T  that gamma crosses. 

The algorithm used is the perfect matching formula from the following papers:
"Positivity for cluster algebras from surfaces" http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0748 (section 4).
"Bases for cluster algebras from surfaces" http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4364 (section 3).

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

I just had a quick look. Some remarks:

* every line with `EXAMPLES::` (or ending with `::`) must be followed by an empty line

* try no to use comments (with #) in the doc. You can just make sentences.

* do not put space after the name of a function:
`def mything(myarg):`
and not
`def mything (myarg):`

<a id='comment:14'></a>Ok, I am currently cleaning the doc so that it will build.

The main point is that you did something like that (many times)

```
EXAMPLES::

    Here is my favorite example::

        sage: 1 + 1 == 3
```
where it should be instead

```
EXAMPLES:

Here is my favorite example::

    sage: 1 + 1 == 3
```

One other important point is that reference should be only given ***once*** in all the sage library. You should not duplicate the same reference in distinct files. Sage is able to find them in any place, so you can use citations from references in any other file.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hello,

I have made a branch `public/ticket/16310` based on `u/egunawan/ticket/16310` on top of sage 6.5.rc3

If you were working with sage 6.4.1, you should before go to 6.5.rc3 or later. You can then pull this branch using `git pull public/ticket/16310`

Doc now builds. I have tried not to touch the code, but could not completely stop myself to do that. I should not have broken anything, but please check that it still works.

<a id='comment:17'></a>Thank you for fixing my code!

Question 1:
The two failing doctests above happen in Version 6.5.rc2 but all tests (in cluster_algebra_quiver folder) pass in Version 6.5.rc3.

list.sort() method behaves differently in Version 6.5.rc2 and Version 6.5.rc3. Should I change my doctests so that my doctests do not depend on the behavior of list.sort()?

Sage Version 6.5.rc3 and Version 6.4:
sage: li = [1,2,3,'r','ell']
sage: li.sort()
sage: li
['ell', 'r', 1, 2, 3]

=============

Sage Version 6.5.rc2:
sage: li = [1,2,3,'r','ell']
sage: li.sort()
sage: li
[1, 2, 3, 'ell', 'r']


Question 2:
In the future, when I need to push new commits to the public branch "public/ticket/16310", do I type
"git push --set-upstream trac HEAD:public/ticket/16310" or do I need to do something different?

In several months, we would like to enhance this code so that user can work with a surface cluster algebra *with principal coefficients*. Do we create a new ticket and branch or continue with this ticket?

Well, all tests must pass in the most recent version.

It seems very strange to use lists that mix integers and letters. Is this really what you use in the code ? Could you try to avoid that ?

The set-upstream is a convenience, not a necessity. You can just use

"git push trac HEAD:public/ticket/16310"

But in fact, it is not necessary that you work with the `public/ticket/16310` branch

Instead I think that you can do that:

1) git checkout "your local name for the branch u/egunawan/ticket/16310"
So you are "sitting on your branch"
2) git pull trac public/ticket/16310
So you have included "public/ticket/16310" in your branch
3) then you can just use "git push trac HEAD:u/egunawan/ticket/16310" as before to push into trac under that name
4) you can put back "u/egunawan/ticket/16310" in the branch field of trac

But I am not a git wizard, so be careful..

I suggest you click on the "commits" links at right of the Branch field (above here) to see what happens to the various branches : they coexist. Currently yours is behind public, but it can very well go back to leading position, if you do what I suggest.

> In several months, we would like to enhance this code so that user can work with a surface cluster algebra *with principal coefficients*. Do we create a new ticket and branch or continue with this ticket?


Well, it depends on your priorities. In my opinion, there is still some work to be done here before this can enter [SageMath](SageMath). Adding another layer of complexity can only make things take longer. So I would suggest to make another ticket, depending on this one.
