In `categories.Monoids._test_one()` the hash value of a monoid's one is tested.

```
tester.assertEqual(type(one.__hash__()), int) 
tester.assertEqual(one.__hash__(), one.__hash__())
```
For unhashable objects, such as a p-adic one this should not be tested. It currently works, because `__hash__()` is inherited and therefore defined. Eventually, `__hash__` will be dropped #11895. In this ticket, the behaviour is changed, so that `_test_one()` does not check the hash if the element does not inherit from `collections.Hashable`. However, this does not work for Cython extension classes: ​http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.cython.user/11569. For those, this check has to be skipped explicitly.

The same problem exists for `CommutativeAdditiveMonoids._test_zero()`.

Hi!

Thanks for shaking the generic tests with one more use case :-)

I agree that it makes sense to disable the test if the object is not
hashable. On the other hand, I would much prefer to have an explicit
test like:

```
    isinstance(..., collections.Hashable)
```

This better expresses the intention and also avoids the risk of false
positives in case a TypeError failure would be raised for some other
reasons and be silently caught.

Of course the above isinstance test fails if there is a `__hash__`
method defined. But this can be conveniently fixed by setting
`__hash__` to `None` in the element class. In fact this sounds like a
natural thing to do anyway: having `__hash__` defined and return
something, and worst something that could change over time, is nothing
but a potential source of issues, isn't it?

With `__hash__` set to `None`, we have as desired:

```
    sage: import collections
    sage: K.<a> = Qq(9)
    sage: K.zero
    sage: isinstance(K.zero(), collections.Hashable)
    False
```

Agreed, the right fix (tm) would probably be to remove the infamous
`SageObject.__hash__` method in the first place. Not all SageObjects
are hashable, and anyway computing the hash in term of `_repr_` is
just a continuous source of bugs. But this fix could take some work
since one would need to implement `__hash__` properly in a bunch of
places; so let's say that this is for a separate ticket.

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

I thought about this too. I agree that this would be better in theory. The problem with this approach are things like matrices. They define a hash which raises a `TypeError` if the matrix is mutable.

I agree. At first it seems that basing this on `_repr_` is exactly what one wants. But the little work you save is just not worth all the trouble it causes.

- The methods one and zero should return immutable objects whenever
  possible, because more often than not the result is cached.  If the
  result is a matrix this is no issue: it's enough to make it
  immutable. And then it becomes hashable. Part of the rationale of
  this test is precisely to check for this!

- Having a method `__hash__` that raises an error is bad advertising in

  (e.g. for objects that can be immutable or not). But I would not
  want to particularly support this.

Right. But what about any type for which equality depends on a p-adic number? (Say, a polynomial with p-adic coefficients.) If we don't want to have special classes for all these, then `__hash__` will have to raise a `TypeError` when computing the hash of its coefficients (see #11895).

Hi Julian,

Interesting example. Well, we are in the situation of class that
declares itself as hashable by providing a hash function, and then
later refutes this contract by throwing errors. I see this as a bug.

Alright, a minor enough bug that we may well not want to introduce
complicated infrastructure to fix it.

However changing test_one and test_zero for this is just hiding this
bug, and might hide other more important bugs in the future. I find
preferable to explicitly skip `_test_one()` in the doctests: this will
do what we mean: there is a known bug, and it's deemed minor enough to
ignore it.

Now, if we would want a real fix we could have polynomial rings check
whether there base ring elements can be hashed, and insert `__hash__ = None`
in their custom element class. This could get tricky for a
Cython class though. But this states quite explicitly: I am hashable if my
base ring elements are.

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

Do you know if a Cython class can be marked as being unhashable? `__hash__=None` does not work in Cython. (Maybe that's what you meant by "This could get tricky for a Cython class though."?)

Btw., setting `tp_hash` does not work either:

```
sage: cython('''
cdef extern from "Python.h":
    long PyObject_HashNotImplemented(object)
    ctypedef struct PyTypeObject:
        long tp_hash(object)

cdef class A(object):
   pass

(<PyTypeObject *> A).tp_hash = PyObject_HashNotImplemented

''')
sage: hash(A())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-83-c87e237c4d02> in <module>()
----> 1 hash(A())

TypeError: unhashable type: '_dev_shm_dot_sage_temp_cslogin02_10081_tmp_o8x_Zq_spyx_0.A'
sage: isinstance(A(),collections.Hashable)

```

I don't know. That's indeed typically the kind of difficulties I
meant. Also that a parent can't have is own "copy" of the class to
mark it as unhashable when other parent sharing the same class will
want to have its elements hashable.

Thanks for investigating!
