nope, it is in the commit ​29c48c3... I don't understand the error!!

EDIT: and the doctest pass on my computer!

REDIT: actually depending from where you run the computation the test fails or not

from SAGE_ROOT running

```
sage -t src/sage/combinat/designs/latin_squares.py

**does** fail!!

<a id='comment:11'>**Comment 11:**</a>
Easy solution:

move the file handbook_data.txt into local/share (where most of the raw data belong) and then use

```
import os.path
from sage.misc.misc import SAGE_SHARE
handbook_file = open(os.path.join(SAGE_SHARE, "handbook_data.txt"),'r')
...
```

What do you think Nathann?

You mean that whoever copies/paste Sage's table of MOLS in a paper has to publish it in open access, or that whoever uses our table in a software has to license it with the GPL ? `:-P`

I take it as a mathematical result. Or 10 000 mathematical results. Of which a good part has been obtained with Sage's functions `;-)`

> You are probably right with the spkg. In order to work, the spkg needs to be in standard but the policy is that new spkg goes into optional.

I don't think that anybody is stupid enough to tell me that I need to wait one year to add a text file into Sage.

I will write to Sage, if that's a problem.

I'm ok with making it a standard spkg. Note that, by definition, this means that it is installed by default. You need a corresponding entry in `build/deps` for that.

A more specific name than "designs" would be nice, maybe "combinatorial_designs". But design alone isn't even unique in math, e.g. dessins d'enfants.

A saner way to install the file would be to mkdir -p the target directory and then just copy the file. Blowing the whole directory away is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive in the future, maybe you'll add an optional huge database later on. Not to mention umasks.
