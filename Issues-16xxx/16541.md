You mean that whoever copies/paste Sage's table of MOLS in a paper has to publish it in open access, or that whoever uses our table in a software has to license it with the GPL ? `:-P`

I take it as a mathematical result. Or 10 000 mathematical results. Of which a good part has been obtained with Sage's functions `;-)`

I don't think that anybody is stupid enough to tell me that I need to wait one year to add a text file into Sage.

I will write to Sage, if that's a problem.
