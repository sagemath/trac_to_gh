It took me a bit to figure out what was wrong after getting

```
***************************************************************
Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build:

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.
```
And what was wrong was that "package sage-6.3.beta4" failed to build (due to wrong $HOME where Cython cache was supposed to live) - is it actually considered a package? On the one hand there is no sage in upstream or build/pkgs, on the other - there is log/pkgs/sage-*

In any case it would be nice to have a more clear error message - usually it gives paths to the log files that contain the error message in the end, as looking for errors on the console or install.log is inconvenient for parallel builds. Looks like #14263 just missed this particular case.
