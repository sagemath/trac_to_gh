<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi Nathann,

1) One lines 656-659 you have an import followed by a commented check!!

```
from sage.combinat.designs.bibd import _check_pbd
PBD = [[relabel[xx] for xx in B if not xx in points_to_delete] for B in TD]

# _check_pbd(PBD,n,[q,q-x-1,q-x+1,x+2])
```
why is that?

2) This is wrong (lines 730-731)

```
# The next is always True, because q is a prime power
# orthogonal_array(k+1,q,existence=True) and
```
if k+1 > q... instead we can start the loop at k+1 instead of 3.

3) I bounced into something bad: I wanted to change in `find_recursive_construction` the

```
assert k >= 3
```
into a

```
assert k > 3, "you do not need recursion for k<4"
```
since it is trivial to build one latin square. But it appears that the recursive constructions is called with k=3 many times! so bad! This has to be corrected... but hopefully, not here. I guess that #16535 would be the good place.

It is something I used while implementing the construction and as it said something about the PBD I left it. I updated that comment as that troubled you.

The line before that one is 

```
            orthogonal_array(k+1,q-x+1,existence=True) and
```

Why in #16535 ? What we need to do is add a case for k=3 in the `orthogonal_array` constructor.

I fixed the things above, plus an apparently incorrect `1<x`.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi Nathann,

You can actually cut the loop if `x >= q` as `x` is increasing along the loop. It is done at `public/16503` (it does not matter too much right now, but it will if you want to compute a big MOLS table).

Beyond that, you can set to positive review.
