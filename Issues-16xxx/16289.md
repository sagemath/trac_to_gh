This fails due to an inadvertent change introduced by #12959:

```
sage: ZZ.cartesian_product(GF(2), NN)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: type object 'sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class' has no attribute 'CartesianProduct'
```
This ticket reverts this change and adds a doctest.
