Wow. Coool to see something happend there ! Thanks for the work ! `:-)`

Here is a first-pass-review. 

- The new file should be added to the doc

- "Associates to n is a dictionnary"

- Could you add references for the DF ? (even if it is always "from the handbook")

- Unless you add a definition of what a DF is at the head of `difference_family.py` I would say that your "todo" belongs to the constructor, after the def.

- All functions need a docstring.

- `zmod_or_finite_field` : why not always use a GF ? By the way the name of this function is not sufficiently descriptive. Same for `group_law`

- About `group_law` : I was telling Nicolas the other day how it would be more proper to have a category `Groups()` which would be "any kind of group" and also have a "MultiplicativeGroups()` category for ... well, multiplicative groups.

- `quadratic_residues`, `quartic_residues` and `cyclotomic_cosets` belong to the Fields code (and probably to another patch, so that the Fields guys see that it is being added)

- Could you add a SEEALSO link from is_difference_family to difference_family, as the latter contains the actual definition of a DF ?

- I expect that _have_distinct_images would be faster if you added all elements to the set directly (i.e. `set(map(f,elts))` then checked that it has the right size. This way you do not 1) check that the element is in the set 2) add it, i.e. two `log(n)` computations.

- `difference_family` needs an INPUT section (and could be linked toward `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_set`).

- `have_distinct_images` too

- Shouldn't  `Return a `(k,l)`-difference family` use "lambda" instead ? You use both `l` and `lambda` in the docstring. I think I saw `lambd` or `lam` used once.

- You don't need to check that the value of 'l' is correct when you computed it yourself. It belongs to the "else" group above.

- `such that the set of differences seen as a multi-set contains` : it does not say what the "set of differences" actually is, i.e. the union of the sets of differences corresponding to every set of the family... This sentence isn't very clear either, it may deserve another sentence.

- `is_difference_family` -- looks like the case when one of the "sets" of the DF contains the same element twice is handled correctly, but maybe it should deserves an explicit error ? Especially for things like the set `[0,5,10,15]` over `GF(5**4)` which may not be obvious.

- Languages should have built-in functions so that "{} times" becomes "{} time" when `{} == 1` `:-P`

- why `DF_constructions[v][k,l]` instead of `DF_constructions[v,k,l]` ?

- I still have not read/checked the main function, i.e. `difference_family`.

Thanks. I just answer to the remarks for which it is not clear to me what to do.

> - About `group_law` : I was telling Nicolas the other day how it would be more proper to have a category `Groups()` which would be "any kind of group" and also have a "MultiplicativeGroups()` category for ... well, multiplicative groups.


But then how do you get the group law? I would be happy to see my `group_law` method as a method of any group. Tell Nicolas, that the power set of a set with the operation of symmetric difference is also a group... which is neither additive nor multiplicative ;-)

> - `quadratic_residues`, `quartic_residues` and `cyclotomic_cosets` belong to the Fields code (and probably to another patch, so that the Fields guys see that it is being added)


Problem1: `quadratic_residues` is already a function that takes an integer `n` as input and return the squares modulo `n`. The ouptut are sage `Integer`. So it does not fit very well as I need finite field which are not necessarily primes. Idem for `cyclotomic_cosets`.

> - I expect that _have_distinct_images would be faster if you added all elements to the set directly (i.e. `set(map(f,elts))` then checked that it has the right size. This way you do not 1) check that the element is in the set 2) add it, i.e. two `log(n)` computations.


As my set are rather small, you are probably right.

> - `is_difference_family` -- looks like the case when one of the "sets" of the DF contains the same element twice is handled correctly, but maybe it should deserves an explicit error ? Especially for things like the set `[0,5,10,15]` over `GF(5**4)` which may not be obvious.


Such blocks might be valid for lambda > 1. (but note that `0=5=10=15` in your `GF(5**4)`).

> - I still have not read/checked the main function, i.e. `difference_family`.


No hurry. I have to do the changes.

It is already (partly) tested in the `bibd.py` file. But I will add something more explicit.

Yooooooooo !

> But then how do you get the group law? 


It's unrelated. My remark was just that this is wrong :

```
sage: groups.misc.AdditiveCyclic(4) in Groups()
False
```

What we have now is that `MultiplicativeGroups` is improperly called "groups". That's just about the thing's name.

> I would be happy to see my `group_law` method as a method of any group.


We, it could definitely be the first method of a `Groups()` category !

> Tell Nicolas, that the power set of a set with the operation of symmetric difference is also a group... which is neither additive nor multiplicative ;-)


Well, you got the email so tell him. That's actually dead right !

> Problem1: `quadratic_residues` is already a function that takes an integer `n` as input and return the squares modulo `n`. The ouptut are sage `Integer`. So it does not fit very well as I need finite field which are not necessarily primes. Idem for `cyclotomic_cosets`.


quadratic_residues is a function from the global namespace. What you are implementing is a method of Fields, isn't it ?

> Such blocks might be valid for lambda > 1. (but note that `0=5=10=15` in your `GF(5**4)`).


That's exactly why I picked those values. Are you allowed to have the same element twice in a set of a difference family ?

> It is already (partly) tested in the `bibd.py` file. But I will add something more explicit.


Yes yes, I just worried that it could only be triggered when you try to compute exhaustively all BIBD for n<500 or something.

I refactored `quadratic_residues`, `quartic_residues` and `cyclotomic_cosets` into a unique function named `cyclotomic_cosets` and that takes a `cosets` argument. It definitely belong to finite fields, but I am not sure this is standard terminology in algebra... I believe not... The multiplicative group of invertible elements of a finite field is always cyclic, so any coset is actually "cyclotomic". It might be `multiplicative_cosets`. Nevertheless, I am not sure it would be of much use as a method of finite field and I would rather let it where it is.

Nope: the difference must belong to `G \ {0}` so you can not repeat an element.

It is now completely tested.

Hello !!

Is `if l == (k-1):` equivalent to `if (v-1)%k == 0` ?

No. None of the one implies the other.

Assume `l(v-1) % (k(k-1)) == 0`. Then:
- if `l = k-1` then `v-1` is can be any multiple of `k`
- if `v-1 = k(k-1)` then `l` is arbitrary

Yesyesyes. I needed some time to find out why those cyclotomic cosets were cool difference families and I finally understood it to some extent `:-)`

As your function handles a lot of `l>1` already, what would you mean of changing the "if" into "`(v-1)%k == 0 and l%(k-1) == 0`" ? In which case we could return "several times the same difference family" if `l` is equal to `2(k-1)` ?

For this ticket, I see two solutions:
- make a more specialized function which take as input a fixed Abelian group (given by its invariants) and not only `v`. The case of cyclic families would just be the invariant being `(v,)` itself and power of cyclic would be `(v,v,...,v)`.
- write a TODO

The first solution is not that complicated. But then, it would make more sense to have:
- `designs.difference_family(v,k,lambda)`: do not care about the group
- `designs.abelian_difference_family(invariants, k, lambda)`: we care

I don't see the relationship that you make between the group and the lambda. For me the problem is only that we need a way to detect that we can build a `(v,k,l1+l2)-DF` if we can build a `(v,k,l1)-DF` and a `(v,k,l2)-DF`. What does the group have to do with that ?

If your two DF are on the same group you can take the union. Otherwise it just makes no sense!!

Ahahahah. True, true. I was thinking of BIBD, sorry `:-D`

Soooooooooooooooo we only need to implement this l1+l2 mechanism for BIBD.. And designs in general. Hmmmmmm `:-P`

It can be worth it to have it at the level of the difference families to build designs with transitive symmetric groups.

All right, it can be replaced by:

```
   len(set(to_coset[elt] for elt in XXX)) == len(XXX)
