There is a todo block in `category_with_axiom.py` starting at line 1249; this does the first one:

```
    - A functorial construction category (Graded, CartesianProducts,
      ...) having a :class:`Category_singleton` as base category
      should be a :class:`CategoryWithAxiom_singleton`.

      Nothing difficult to implement, but this will need to rework the
      current "no subclass of a concrete class" assertion test of
      :meth:`Category_singleton.__classcall__`.
```

This is needed in #16513 to have the differential semirings as a construction.

What I'm currently doing in #16513 is making the check for an ABC of `Category_singleton` in `Category_singleton.__classcall__()` much weaker (and potentially more time consuming) by looking through the entire MRO. I've separated this off here.

So here's what I'm currently doing. Is this the right way to do things? Do you think this could/will cause a speed regression (do we even because things don't work currently)?

I'm also not quite sure how to construct a simple doctest/example. I have my current working version of #16513 at `u/tscrim/16513-WIP` and have it so you can just type:

```
sage: Semirings().Differential()
Category of differential semirings
```
so it seems to work...

Well, maybe this isn't a (complete) solution (although it could be my current implementation):

```
sage: Rings().Differential()
Category of additive inverse differential semirings
sage: Rings().Division().Differential()
Category of division no zero divisors additive inverse differential semirings
```
