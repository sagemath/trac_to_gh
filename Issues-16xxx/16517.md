There is a todo block in `category_with_axiom.py` starting at line 1249; this does the first one:

```
    - A functorial construction category (Graded, CartesianProducts,
      ...) having a :class:`Category_singleton` as base category
      should be a :class:`CategoryWithAxiom_singleton`.

      Nothing difficult to implement, but this will need to rework the
      current "no subclass of a concrete class" assertion test of
      :meth:`Category_singleton.__classcall__`.
```

This is needed in #16513 to have the differential semirings as a construction.

What I'm currently doing in #16513 is making the check for an ABC of `Category_singleton` in `Category_singleton.__classcall__()` much weaker (and potentially more time consuming) by looking through the entire MRO. I've separated this off here.

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
So here's what I'm currently doing. Is this the right way to do things? Do you think this could/will cause a speed regression (do we even because things don't work currently)?

I'm also not quite sure how to construct a simple doctest/example. I have my current working version of #16513 at `u/tscrim/16513-WIP` and have it so you can just type:

```
sage: Semirings().Differential()
Category of differential semirings
```
so it seems to work...

Well, maybe this isn't a (complete) solution (although it could be my current implementation):

```
sage: Rings().Differential()
Category of additive inverse differential semirings
sage: Rings().Division().Differential()
Category of division no zero divisors additive inverse differential semirings
```
