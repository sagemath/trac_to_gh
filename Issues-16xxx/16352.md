`TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` are used in the code of `sage/combinat`, `sage/categories` and `sage/groups` at least. These should be replaced by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` for speed improvements and also to avoid issues explained in #6637.

This is a follow up of #6637 where `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` have been deprecated.

More precisely, occurences of

   `TransitiveIdeal(succ, seeds)`
   `TransitiveIdealGraded(succ, seeds, max_depth)`

are replaced (respectively) by:

   `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='naive')`
   `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='breadth', max_depth=max_depth)`

Indeed, deprecated `TransitiveIdealGraded` class was not using the hypothesis of being graded in its code. This is why the structure is set to `None` for now. Of course, if people have *really* a graded structure, then the structure argument should be set to `'graded'`... For now, I am keeping the behavior like it was before and I am assuming the structure is not graded.

Salut Sébastien,

Your branch is based on sage-6.5!! Would you mind rebasing on sage-6.6.rc2?

Your iterator for infinite conjugacy classes is wrong

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,1,0,1])
sage: b = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,0,1,1])
sage: G = MatrixGroup([a,b])
sage: a = G(a)
sage: b = G(b)
sage: C = ConjugacyClass(G, a)
sage: m1 = b * a * ~b
sage: m2 = ~b * a * b
sage: any(x == m1 for x in C)
True
sage: any(x == m2 for x in C)
... can wait forever ...
```
I think that adding also inverses of generators would work. I.e. just replace `self._parent.gens()` with `self._parent.semigroup_generators()`. And please add the above test in the documentation.

Best,
Vincent

I think that it is necessary to keep the "graded" keyword whenever `TransitiveIdealGraded` was used.
Otherwise, you are losing information, that may never come back.

So I propose to try putting "graded" wherever it already was, and see what happens.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:21'></a>\nOk, I agree, let's have this discussion. I first tried to replace every occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(..., structure='graded')`, but then I got infinite loops.\n\nThe reason is that if a structure is graded, the enumeration currently done in `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` saves in memory only two grades (the current one and the precedent one). If the structure is not graded and we use the graded argument for `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, then we may get infinite loops and elements that are genereated twice or infinitely often.\n\nI won't have access to my machine until Tuesday for redoing those tests and tell you exactly where were the infinite loops happening...\n\nMeanwhile, I would like to know for each occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` in the sage library weather the structure was really graded.

Ok, I agree, let's have this discussion. I first tried to replace every occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(..., structure='graded')`, but then I got infinite loops.

The reason is that if a structure is graded, the enumeration currently done in `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` saves in memory only two grades (the current one and the precedent one). If the structure is not graded and we use the graded argument for `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, then we may get infinite loops and elements that are genereated twice or infinitely often.

I won't have access to my machine until Tuesday for redoing those tests and tell you exactly where were the infinite loops happening...

Meanwhile, I would like to know for each occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` in the sage library weather the structure was really graded. I recall that `TransitiveIdealGraded` was not using the graded hypothesis at all since it was saving *all* of the generated elements.

A) There were three files where `TransitiveIdealGraded` was used:

File `src/sage/categories/crystals.py`

```python
class Crystals(Category_singleton):
    class ParentMethods:
        def __iter__(self, index_set=None, max_depth=float('inf')):
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
            # was using both ???

        def subcrystal(self, index_set=None, generators=None, max_depth=float("inf"),
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
```

File `src/sage/categories/highest_weight_crystals.py`

```python
class HighestWeightCrystals(Category_singleton):
    class ParentMethods:
        def __iter__(self, index_set=None, max_depth = float("inf")):
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
```


File `src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py`

```python
from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal, TransitiveIdealGraded
class RootLatticeRealizations(Category_over_base_ring):
    class ParentMethods:
        @cached_method
        def positive_roots(self, index_set=None):
            return TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('pred', index_set=index_set),
                                         [self.simple_root(i) for i in index_set])
        def positive_real_roots(self):
            if self.cartan_type().is_finite():
                return tuple(TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('pred'), self.simple_roots()))

        @cached_method
        def positive_roots_parabolic(self, index_set = None):
            return TransitiveIdealGraded(parabolic_covers, generators)

    class ElementMethods:
        def orbit(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('simple_reflections'), [self])]

        def greater(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('succ'), [self])]

        def smaller(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('pred'), [self])]
```

B) For reference, below are the files where only `TransitiveIdeal` was used.

File `src/sage/groups/conjugacy_classes.py`

```python
class ConjugacyClass(Parent):
    @cached_method
    def set(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/kr_tableaux.py`

```python
class KirillovReshetikhinTableaux(CrystalOfWords):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/rigged_configurations.py`

```python
class RiggedConfigurations(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/tensor_product_kr_tableaux.py`

```python
class TensorProductOfKirillovReshetikhinTableaux(FullTensorProductOfRegularCrystals):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py`

```python
from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
class PieriFactors(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
    @cached_method
    def elements(self):
        return TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('bruhat_lower_covers'), self.maximal_elements())
```

I have tried putting 'graded' in src/sage/categories/highest_weight_crystals.py
and it worked fine. I tested the file itself and the combinat/crystals folder.

I have tried putting 'graded' in src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py and it worked fine. I tested the src/sage/combinat/root_system folder. Seems to be quicker by the way.

Let us see if the bot founds a problem with these two changes.

Running `sage -t src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py` three times on 6.7.beta3, I get:

```
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.70 s]
```

Running the same command three times on the same file with this branch, I get:

```
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.59 s]
[575 tests, 10.59 s]
```

So I can't confirm that tests take any longer with this ticket. Needs review!
