`TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` are used in the code of `sage/combinat`, `sage/categories` and `sage/groups` at least. These should be replaced by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` for speed improvements and also to avoid issues explained in #6637.

This is a follow up of #6637 where `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` have been deprecated.

More precisely, occurences of

   `TransitiveIdeal(succ, seeds)`
   `TransitiveIdealGraded(succ, seeds, max_depth)`

are replaced (respectively) by:

   `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='naive')`
   `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='breadth', max_depth=max_depth)`

Indeed, deprecated `TransitiveIdealGraded` class was not using the hypothesis of being graded in its code. This is why the structure is set to `None` for now. Of course, if people have *really* a graded structure, then the structure argument should be set to `'graded'`... For now, I am keeping the behavior like it was before and I am assuming the structure is not graded.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Salut Sébastien,

Your branch is based on sage-6.5!! Would you mind rebasing on sage-6.6.rc2?

Your iterator for infinite conjugacy classes is wrong

```
sage: a = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,1,0,1])
sage: b = matrix(ZZ,2,[1,0,1,1])
sage: G = MatrixGroup([a,b])
sage: a = G(a)
sage: b = G(b)
sage: C = ConjugacyClass(G, a)
sage: m1 = b * a * ~b
sage: m2 = ~b * a * b
sage: any(x == m1 for x in C)
True
sage: any(x == m2 for x in C)
... can wait forever ...
```
I think that adding also inverses of generators would work. I.e. just replace `self._parent.gens()` with `self._parent.semigroup_generators()`. And please add the above test in the documentation.

Best,
Vincent

<a id='comment:20'></a>I think that it is necessary to keep the "graded" keyword whenever `TransitiveIdealGraded` was used.
Otherwise, you are losing information, that may never come back.

So I propose to try putting "graded" wherever it already was, and see what happens.

<a id='comment:21'></a>Ok, I agree, let's have this discussion. I first tried to replace every occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` by `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(..., structure='graded')`, but then I got infinite loops.

The reason is that if a structure is graded, the enumeration currently done in `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` saves in memory only two grades (the current one and the precedent one). If the structure is not graded and we use the graded argument for `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet`, then we may get infinite loops and elements that are genereated twice or infinitely often.

I won't have access to my machine until Tuesday for redoing those tests and tell you exactly where were the infinite loops happening...

Meanwhile, I would like to know for each occurences of `TransitiveIdealGraded` in the sage library weather the structure was really graded. I recall that `TransitiveIdealGraded` was not using the graded hypothesis at all since it was saving *all* of the generated elements.

A) There were three files where `TransitiveIdealGraded` was used:

File `src/sage/categories/crystals.py`

```python
class Crystals(Category_singleton):
    class ParentMethods:
        def __iter__(self, index_set=None, max_depth=float('inf')):
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
            # was using both ???

        def subcrystal(self, index_set=None, generators=None, max_depth=float("inf"),
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
```

File `src/sage/categories/highest_weight_crystals.py`

```python
class HighestWeightCrystals(Category_singleton):
    class ParentMethods:
        def __iter__(self, index_set=None, max_depth = float("inf")):
            from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdealGraded
```


File `src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py`

```python
from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal, TransitiveIdealGraded
class RootLatticeRealizations(Category_over_base_ring):
    class ParentMethods:
        @cached_method
        def positive_roots(self, index_set=None):
            return TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('pred', index_set=index_set),
                                         [self.simple_root(i) for i in index_set])
        def positive_real_roots(self):
            if self.cartan_type().is_finite():
                return tuple(TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('pred'), self.simple_roots()))

        @cached_method
        def positive_roots_parabolic(self, index_set = None):
            return TransitiveIdealGraded(parabolic_covers, generators)

    class ElementMethods:
        def orbit(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdealGraded(attrcall('simple_reflections'), [self])]

        def greater(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('succ'), [self])]

        def smaller(self):
            return [x for x in TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('pred'), [self])]
```

B) For reference, below are the files where only `TransitiveIdeal` was used.

File `src/sage/groups/conjugacy_classes.py`

```python
class ConjugacyClass(Parent):
    @cached_method
    def set(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/kr_tableaux.py`

```python
class KirillovReshetikhinTableaux(CrystalOfWords):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/rigged_configurations.py`

```python
class RiggedConfigurations(Parent, UniqueRepresentation):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations/tensor_product_kr_tableaux.py`

```python
class TensorProductOfKirillovReshetikhinTableaux(FullTensorProductOfRegularCrystals):
    def __iter__(self):
        from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
```

File `src/sage/combinat/root_system/pieri_factors.py`

```python
from sage.combinat.backtrack import TransitiveIdeal
class PieriFactors(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
    @cached_method
    def elements(self):
        return TransitiveIdeal(attrcall('bruhat_lower_covers'), self.maximal_elements())
```

<a id='comment:23'></a>I have tried putting 'graded' in src/sage/categories/highest_weight_crystals.py
and it worked fine. I tested the file itself and the combinat/crystals folder.

I have tried putting 'graded' in src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py and it worked fine. I tested the src/sage/combinat/root_system folder. Seems to be quicker by the way.

Let us see if the bot founds a problem with these two changes.

Running `sage -t src/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realizations.py` three times on 6.7.beta3, I get:

```
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.70 s]
```

Running the same command three times on the same file with this branch, I get:

```
[575 tests, 10.62 s]
[575 tests, 10.59 s]
[575 tests, 10.59 s]
```

So I can't confirm that tests take any longer with this ticket. Needs review!
