I didn't realize until now that the ticket was still set to "new". In the future, you should set the ticket to "needs review" so that someone can come by and have a look. If it stays at "new", then the usual assumption is that there are no patches waiting for review.

Thanks a lot.

Yes, I know that git commits should not be modified once they are distributed publically. I was thinking more about creating a new "final" git branch with a different name. Suppose it's not really something to worry about.

Following your hint, I've just set #15006 to "needs review" as well (this is a completely unrelated report, but I realized it should be easy to fix and posted a git branch there as well).

Wait for the next beta release. Once the release happens, you can upgrade Sage and check that the fix is in. To upgrade Sage, just do the following

```
$ git checkout --track origin/develop -b develop
$ ./sage -upgrade develop
```
You can check for beta releases at [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-release).

In other words: I can't right now and the fix is in limbo (aka "no man's land").

I don't like this. In Debian we close bugs when a new upload is available in unstable.
I wish every open source / free software project would do the same.

You can always check out your own branch, so it is not really in "no man's land".

```
$ git checkout origin/develop -b develop # if you don't already have it
$ git trac checkout 16445 # if you have git-trac-command installed
```

That said, the beta releases of Sage come out roughly every two weeks. The last one came out on June 4, so we are in the middle of the period between two releases.
