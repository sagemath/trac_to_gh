```
(see ticket:19993#comment:10).

Fix this by conversion to arb, computation of zeta there, and conversion back.
(`mpfi` does not seem to have a zeta function).

I do have a TeX file containing additional (boring) computations documenting parts of the code, but I am not sure where to put it, see my post on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/n1YtulIuaF8/a16pTD6XuRAJ).

Thank you for pointing that out; once #16747 is included and there are conversions between CIF and arb, that would certainly be the better option.
