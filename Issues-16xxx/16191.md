Implement `FSMState.final_word_out` in order to accomodate subsequential transducers in this package. A transducer is said to be subsequential if it is deterministic, every state
is final and it has a final output word for each final state, i.e., when reading an input and reaching some final state along some path, then the final output word of this state is appended to the output labels collected along the path.

This will facilitate various transducers, e.g., when we currently have to read a sufficiently large number of zeros in order to flush some more output.

final_word_out is introduced in #16253. Now final_word_out is implemented everywhere (or there is a `NotImplementedError`, see #16548).

I reviewed the patch. Builds, doctests pass. I added one commit with rather minor changes (punctuation, indentation, `.. TODO::` tag) and moved the new example from the private method `_composition_explorative_` to the public method `composition`.

Please cross-review these changes and feel free to set the status to positive_review.
