Previously, a (more or less) random path was chosen in case of ambiguity
in `FiniteStateMachine.process`. Instead, we now raise a `NotImplementedError`.

Ideally, process would follow all possible paths. This is #16538, but will need some more time.

As a stop-gap measure, we at least raise a `NotImplementedError` if the situation occurs.
