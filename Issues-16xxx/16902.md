1) `sig_on/sig_off` is Sage specific or is it included within Cython? It would be worth mentioning it. If it is Sage specific, why is that? and how do people coding in Cython do? (seems to be `with nogil`). If it is shipped with Cython, there should a pointer toward its documentation.

2) I am not sure that the following example is relevant.

```
def stack_sig_on():
    sig_on()
    sig_on()
    sig_on()
    # (some code)
    sig_off()
    sig_off()
    sig_off()
```
I mean, what would be the purpose of such code? If it is none, it is still interesting to mention it within a stack of calls like

```
def f1():
    sig_on()
    x = f2()
    sig_off()
    # ...

def f2():
    sig_on()
    # ...
    sig_off()
    return ans
```

3) The section `Releasing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)` was a bit obscure to me. It would be nice to have one sentence to say what it is. I guess it is related to my remark 1.

4) After reading the implementation of `alarm` I wonder why using `alarm` in doctests rather than directly the `setitimer` from the `signal` library? It is basically in `TESTS` blocks that such test
would appear, and involving there the `signal` library is not ugly (and people reading it will learn about it instead of learning Sage wrapper!)

I learned many things reading it!
Thanks!
Vincent

It is completely Sage-specific, I guess other people writing Cython code do not care about interrupts. There has been talking about putting these in Cython, but that has not happened yet.

Good suggestion!

> 3) The section `Releasing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)` was a bit obscure to me. It would be nice to have one sentence to say what it is. I guess it is related to my remark 1.

It is one of those things where, if you don't know it, you don't need to care. But I can put a link to the Cython documentation.

> 4) After reading the implementation of `alarm` I wonder why using `alarm` in doctests rather than directly the `setitimer` from the `signal` library?

Because `alarm()` is much cleaner.

Why is it not ugly?

> and people reading it will learn about it instead of learning Sage wrapper!

If people care about Sage's wrapper, they can still figure out the implementation and can find out about `setitimer` that way.

my complaint about the change is about the line

```
or possibly the next Python code.
```
this is too vague (and grammatically weird - it should better be `Python statement`). 

Does it mean that one need reach a Python exception? Or any Python statement?
And what is the role of the word `possible` there? I don't get it.

I mean that Python code can sometimes raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`, but I also don't know exactly when this happens. For example, the following can be interrupted:

```
cython('while True: print "foo"')
```
But the following cannot be interrupted:

```
cython('while True: x = ["foo"] * 100')
```

Do you mean to say that Python won't be able to catch the interrupt in the former case, but not in the latter case (i.e. the latter loop will keep running)?

I mean that the loop in the last case will keep running because Python doesn't check for interrupts when executing `x = ["foo"] * 100`.

Whereas if the next statement after the latter was also cython, it would be terminated?
Is this what you mean by `possibly`?
