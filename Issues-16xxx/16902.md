Good suggestion!

It is one of those things where, if you don't know it, you don't need to care. But I can put a link to the Cython documentation.

Because `alarm()` is much cleaner.

Why is it not ugly?

> and people reading it will learn about it instead of learning Sage wrapper!

If people care about Sage's wrapper, they can still figure out the implementation and can find out about `setitimer` that way.

this is too vague (and grammatically weird - it should better be `Python statement`). 

Does it mean that one need reach a Python exception? Or any Python statement?
And what is the role of the word `possible` there? I don't get it.

I mean that Python code can sometimes raise a `KeyboardInterrupt`, but I also don't know exactly when this happens. For example, the following can be interrupted:

```
cython('while True: print "foo"')
```
But the following cannot be interrupted:

```
cython('while True: x = ["foo"] * 100')
```

Do you mean to say that Python won't be able to catch the interrupt in the former case, but not in the latter case (i.e. the latter loop will keep running)?

I mean that the loop in the last case will keep running because Python doesn't check for interrupts when executing `x = ["foo"] * 100`.

Whereas if the next statement after the latter was also cython, it would be terminated?
