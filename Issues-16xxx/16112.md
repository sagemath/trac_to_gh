On cygwin64, atlas compiles if and only if the patch is applied.

However, it is not clear to me why the patch is necessary, since Win64 is a valid target for atlas. Could you explain if this is the right thing, or if this is a hack until some bugs are fixed upstream?

I'm not sure why this is needed.
According to my tests:
* it does not work with Win64 (in fact ATLAS fails to pick a working compiler IIRC...),
* it does with WinNT.
I'm not sure what is involved in ATLAS build system which makes these differences.
I don't really remember if I actually managed to build ATLAS with Win64 used.
I fear I changed that after my successful builds because I just discovered that value and thought "oj this looks nice, let's put this in".
