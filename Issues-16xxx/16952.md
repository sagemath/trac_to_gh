Buckygen has been an optional package since May 2013. It has a minimal footprint: just installs one executable that is quite small and compiles quickly. It is the fastest generator for fullerenes and it is GPLv3.

Depends on #16945

Nico, making a package standard should be discussed on `sage-devel`. And to be honest, I think your package is much too specialized to be standard.

On a legal note, standard packages must be at GPLv3+ compatible (including the *or later*). Just GPLv3 is not OK. Its fine for optional packages, though.

Yes, William once said that package was included for historical reasons. Today it probably wouldn't be added as standard package.

Really? `zn_poly` has:

OK, no problem. The package works fine as an optional package. I just thought that this was the 'natural' evulotion. If specialised packages stay optional, then I'm not going to argue with that.

I wanted to close the ticket, but apparently I can't. I have removed the needs_review status in any case.
