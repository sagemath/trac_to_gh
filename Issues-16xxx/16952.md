Buckygen has been an optional package since May 2013. It has a minimal footprint: just installs one executable that is quite small and compiles quickly. It is the fastest generator for fullerenes and it is GPLv3.

Depends on #16945

Nico, making a package standard should be discussed on `sage-devel`. And to be honest, I think your package is much too specialized to be standard.

Yes, William once said that package was included for historical reasons. Today it probably wouldn't be added as standard package.

Really? `zn_poly` has:
