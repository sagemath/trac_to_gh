Nico, making a package standard should be discussed on `sage-devel`. And to be honest, I think your package is much too specialized to be standard.

Really? `zn_poly` has:

OK, no problem. The package works fine as an optional package. I just thought that this was the 'natural' evulotion. If specialised packages stay optional, then I'm not going to argue with that.

I wanted to close the ticket, but apparently I can't. I have removed the needs_review status in any case.
