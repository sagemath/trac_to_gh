At the moment in sage-6.2.beta7, in designs.HadamardDesign, we have implemented the Hadamard 2-design with paramters 2-(4n-1, 2n-1, n-1) one gets from a Hadamard matrix of order 4n. 

But, of course, this design extends uniquely to a (necessarily) 2-(4n, 2n, n-1) design: the blocks of this design are blocks of the old design union a new point infinity and complements (in the old point set) of the blocks of old design. And, any contraction is isomorphic to a Hadamard 2-design we started off with. So, unsurprisingly, this family is called Hadamard 3-designs.

We could very easily implement these too.

Hello !

Thank you for this ticket. Nothing wrong in the maths now that `4` is excluded, so only administrative remarks

1) Better to keep the first line of the docstring short and informative. And at most one line

2) There should be an INPUT section, even though most of the functions of this file are a bit old and don't respect that

3) You can link toward the doc of other functions, so unless you wanted to advertise the `designs.<tab>` thing it is better to use `:meth:` or `:func:` instead of just giving the function's name. This appears as a link in the final html doc 
` sage -docbuild reference/combinat html`

4) Link toward a reference entry : you needs a _ after the [ref].

5) The reference entry was badly formatted

6) I did not understand the use of `.parent()` in this context. I removed it, and no problem. Integers are not so tricky that you need parents to handle them

All this has been implemented in a public/16211. As usual, positive review to your branch. If you agree with my changes (and change the branch's name or add my commits to your branch) then you can set the ticket to `positive_review`.

Nathann

Will do from the next time! 
 
> 2) There should be an INPUT section, even though most of the functions of this file are a bit old and don't respect that


I am planning on touching this file again, with more designs, so I will take this up that time... For example, circle geometries, inversive planes, translation planes are coming up next! 


> 3) You can link toward the doc of other functions, so unless you wanted to advertise the `designs.<tab>` thing it is better to use `:meth:` or `:func:` instead of just giving the function's name. This appears as a link in the final html doc

Thank you for fixing these!

OK! I was just emulating the construction of Hadamard 2-design code!
