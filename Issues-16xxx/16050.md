This is just a bit of cleanup+bugfixes that I've done over the past couple weeks. Notable changes:

- remove deprecations from #12719
- fix iload to actually be able to edit the loaded lines (could still be better, but would require more hacking on ipython internals; probably should just be added to upstream ipython instead)
- fix weird random bugs encountered with `InterfaceShellTransformer` (e.g. in gap, creating an error will cause future valid lines to error out) -- as far as I can tell, the code was just overthought (and had interface specific things that should belong as part of the appropriate interface)
- use the IPython shutdown hook rather than customizing `ask_exit`
- remove some dead and unused code
- start migrating files out of `sage.misc` and into `sage.repl`

I would also like to move most of this code out of `sage.misc` to something like `sage.app`, but I'm not really happy with that package name. Maybe something like `sage.terminal`? Suggestions would be welcome.

Also, this is just a first step towards cleanup. Certainly more could be done (e.g. stuff surrounding the preparser), but I figured may as well do this gradually rather than as a patchbomb.

`sage.shell`? `sage.toplevel`? `sage.repl`?

Conflicts with the already-merged (but not released) #15990.

From looking at the source it seems that this still suffers from the same problem as #16154, the sage prompt transformer ought to run first and not last. Can you fix it here, then I'll close my ticket.
