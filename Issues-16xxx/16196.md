Sage prompts with leading whitespace are not removed correctly:

```
sage:    1+1     # works

sage: sage: 1+1     # works

sage:    sage: 1+1     # indent + prompt = fail

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Possibly due to #16050

This should work for now, although I looked a bit into the upstream code, and that should probably be changed to be more configurable (since after all the prompt is configurable).

Is there sage code that is being written with sage (duplicate) prompts? Really duplicate prompts should only come about by copying something into a terminal session, and then copying that pasted content again -- this seems like a complete edge case that wouldn't (and certainly shouldn't) show up in some code that is meant to be used for a long period of time.

IPython already has a dedenter, and it is smart (it strips an equal amount from each line), so all we need to do is strip our prompts after ipython dedents, and for the moment, that means insert after position 0 (and before position 1, so as to not re-break #16154).
