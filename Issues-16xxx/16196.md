Sage prompts with leading whitespace are not removed correctly:

```
sage:    1+1     # works

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
Possibly due to #16050

It looks like the change from #16154 broke this (ipython's leading indent stripper is now being run after our prompt stripper). I can look into this sometime later this week.

This should work for now, although I looked a bit into the upstream code, and that should probably be changed to be more configurable (since after all the prompt is configurable).

Is there sage code that is being written with sage (duplicate) prompts? Really duplicate prompts should only come about by copying something into a terminal session, and then copying that pasted content again -- this seems like a complete edge case that wouldn't (and certainly shouldn't) show up in some code that is meant to be used for a long period of time.

IPython already has a dedenter, and it is smart (it strips an equal amount from each line), so all we need to do is strip our prompts after ipython dedents, and for the moment, that means insert after position 0 (and before position 1, so as to not re-break #16154).
