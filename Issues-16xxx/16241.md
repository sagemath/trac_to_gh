<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Nathann,

1) You forgot to add your functions in the head docstring.

2) Could you do appropriate doctests as in #16227? Especially check that the constructor work for these values.

3) There is a typo or an error in `_MOLS_from_string`. The characters belong to `a-z` and not `0-z`... but, in prevision of bigger constructions it would be better to really start from `0` (which is `chr(48)`) and go up to `z` (which is `chr(122)`).

<a id='comment:9'></a>Yo !

> 1) You forgot to add your functions in the head docstring.


Right ! Fixed it.

> 2) Could you do appropriate doctests as in #16227? Especially check that the constructor work for these values.


I just did. I also did the same for the constructor included in #16235, but as I guess the two tickets will be merged at the same time...

> 3) There is a typo or an error in `_MOLS_from_string`. The characters belong to `a-z` and not `0-z`... but, in prevision of bigger constructions it would be better to really start from `0` (which is `chr(48)`) and go up to `z` (which is `chr(122)`).


If someday it becomes useful, we will do that. This function is hidden, we can change it whenever we want.

In `latin_squares.py`, there was a useless
