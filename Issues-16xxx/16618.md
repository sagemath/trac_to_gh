```
           sage: from sage.categories.category_types import Category_over_base
           sage: D = Modules(Rings())
           sage: class Cs(Category_over_base):
           ....:    def super_categories(self):
           ....:        return [D]
           sage: C = Cs(SymmetricGroup(3))
           sage: C.is_subcategory(D)         # OOPS
           False
```

This is due to:

```
           sage: D._subcategory_hook_(C)
           False
```

My analysis is that the optimization implemented in
`Category_over_base._subcategory_hook_` (if the base is not the same,
then they can't be comparable) is only actually valid for
`Category_over_base_ring`s. So I moved `_subcategory_hook_` down
there. This allows for improving the answer in one corner case that
was pinpointed in the doctests.

Does this sound reasonable? Are there `Category_over_base` for which
we care about such an optimization that are not
`Category_over_base_ring`?

For the record: this issue was detected while trying with Darij to use
categories over a base ring category in symmetric functions, while the
homset ticket #10668 was applied; this triggered a recursion loop in:

```
            sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['q','t']))
            sage: P = Sym.macdonald().P()
            sage: m = Sym.monomial()
            sage: P.transition_matrix(m,2)
```

Sorry for not reacting 11 months ago.

Some comments:
- Some methods (`construction(self)`, `_homset(self, X, Y)`, `is_abelian(self)`) need documentation/tests.
- There is :trac:`???`. Should be :trac:`16618`.

According to the patchbots, it does pass all tests on 8.2.beta6, but fails to build with 8.2.beta7. However, it seems from the patchbot's log that the errors are unrelated with the sage library (the errors occur before building the sage library).

I am thus believe it can be given a positive review.
