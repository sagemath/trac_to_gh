Hi Nathann, 

I would like to review this patch and I have the following remarks about your patch: 

- The doc does not build and I have no idea how to fix these errors! 
- **Linguistic:** A BIBD is a pair (X, B) where X is the set of points and B is the set of blocks. But, the description of the new BIBD as well as how the given BIBD is used in the construction does not make things clear: you say replace sth by a BIBD: what does this mean?  

In view of these remarks, I am setting this to `needs_work` ;-).  

[If not for the fact that does not build, I would have went ahead and made the other changes...]

That was because ``(v,k,1)`-BIBD` is okay for Sphinx, but ``(v,k,1)-`BIBD` is not. Which he clearly reported by saying "Something is wrong". I hate this thing.

Anyway, fixed.

I also avoided the word "replaced" using the same phrasing as in the two other constructions. I also replaced two occurrences of BIBD by BIBDs to make it clearer that we were talking of several BIBD.

I also merged #16091 in, as it is a dependency of this patch.

Hi! 

- My doc building stops at: 

```
[tensor   ] build succeeded.
```

I have seen that there is a discussion on sage-devel. So, I will see what I can do to fix it. I will have this patch reviewed by evening tommorrow (for me!). Sorry for the delay, Nathann.

Helloooooooo !!!

Hmmmm... Well, admittedly I do not like to wrap a list in a class if I don't need to (because doing so may cost non-trivial computations), but in this case the function is really only made to be called by the "main" method, i.e. the constructor of BIBD. It can be called recursively, and it would be nice if we don't convert all the stuff into a Block Design during those calls as we have no reason to `^^;`

Thank you very much !
