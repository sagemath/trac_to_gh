This branch implements three constructions of BIBD from transversal designs. Short, efficient, AND useful for the general construction of BIBD with k=5.

As found in http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

The constructions are explained in the documentation, too.

Depends on #16272

Depends on #16091

Hi Nathann, 

I would like to review this patch and I have the following remarks about your patch: 

- The doc does not build and I have no idea how to fix these errors! 
- **Linguistic:** A BIBD is a pair (X, B) where X is the set of points and B is the set of blocks. But, the description of the new BIBD as well as how the given BIBD is used in the construction does not make things clear: you say replace sth by a BIBD: what does this mean?  

In view of these remarks, I am setting this to `needs_work` ;-).  

[If not for the fact that does not build, I would have went ahead and made the other changes...]

That was because <code>\`(v,k,1)\`-BIBD</code> is okay for Sphinx, but <code>\`(v,k,1)-\`BIBD</code> is not. Which he clearly reported by saying "Something is wrong". I hate this thing.

Anyway, fixed.

I also avoided the word "replaced" using the same phrasing as in the two other constructions. I also replaced two occurrences of BIBD by BIBDs to make it clearer that we were talking of several BIBD.

I also merged #16091 in, as it is a dependency of this patch.

Hi! 

- My doc building stops at: 

```
[tensor   ] build succeeded.
```

I have seen that there is a discussion on sage-devel. So, I will see what I can do to fix it. I will have this patch reviewed by evening tommorrow (for me!). Sorry for the delay, Nathann.

Hi Nathann, 

I just have one query: given that the method is called BIBD_From_TD, I was expecting the function to return a block design, but it returns  a list instead. I also noted that this method is used in the `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` to construct a block design when `existence = True`. So, this is probably the desiderata, but I thought that this is worth pointing out... 

You may set this to `positive review` if you would like to return a list instead of a `BlockDesign`... 

This ticket reviewed using SMC!! :-)
