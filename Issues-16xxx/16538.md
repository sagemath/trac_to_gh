Prior to #16539, a (more or less) random path was chosen in case of ambiguity
in `FiniteStateMachine.process`. In #16539, this undesired behaviour is replaced by a `NonImplementedError`.

However, ideally, in the case of non-deterministic machines, all possible paths should be considered. This shall be implemented in this ticket.

I reviewed your changes and pushed a few minor changes.
