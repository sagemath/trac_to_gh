`AlgebraicClosureFiniteField.as_finite_field_element(minimal=True)` fails when it needs to convert between two non-trivial finite subfields:

```
sage: K = GF(5).algebraic_closure()
sage: z=K.gen(5) - K.gen(5) + K.gen(2)
sage: z.as_finite_field_element(minimal=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce
```
Note that it works fine when `minimal=False` (which is the default).

The finite subfields should not even have to talk to each other; it is `as_finite_field_element()` that should take care of the conversion, in a similar way as `change_level()`.  I made a small patch which I am now testing.

Hi Peter,

And, one more remark, with QQbar when such method is called the internal representation is changed:

```
sage: a = QQbar(2^(1/4))
sage: b = a**2
sage: b.as_number_field_element()
(Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 - 2, a^2, Ring morphism:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^4 - 2
   To:   Algebraic Real Field
   Defn: a |--> 1.189207115002722?)
sage: b.as_number_field_element(minimal=True)
(Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2, a, Ring morphism:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2
   To:   Algebraic Real Field
   Defn: a |--> 1.414213562373095?)
sage: b.as_number_field_element(minimal=False)
(Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2, a, Ring morphism:
   From: Number Field in a with defining polynomial y^2 - 2
   To:   Algebraic Real Field
   Defn: a |--> 1.414213562373095?)
```
Do we want the same here?

Why not, please go ahead.

I don't think we should change the internal representation when the user calls `as_number_field_element()`.  Currently, two elements that compare equal can have a different hash (which is a bad thing); changing the internal representation of an element would therefore mean that its hash can change, which is even worse.

QQbar is careful enough to ensure that equal elements with different representations have the same hash; it would be nice if we could somehow do that too.

right

I know but they "cheat" using the fact that you have a natural embedding to the complex field. Do you have an idea to get a (fast) coherent hash for algebraic closure elements?

The only thing I can think of is to take the hash of the minimal polynomial, which unfortunately (1) is not very fast and (2) gives the same result for all conjugates of an element.

[Edit: or take the hash after coercing to the minimal subfield containing the element, which solves (2) but not (1).]

I think that, the same way that there are "number fields with fixed embeddings on QQbar", there should be "finite filed with fixed embeddings on the algebraic closure". That way 

```
sage: K = GF(5).algebraic_closure()
sage: K3 = K.subfield(3)[0]
sage: K6 = K.subfield(6)[0]  # not used
sage: K3.gen()
z3
sage: K6(K3.gen())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce from a finite field other than the prime subfield
```

Could be made to work and also make mathematical sense.
