That happens if `CFLAGS` are empty (or not exported at all, which presumably is the most frequent case) and `CXXFLAGS` aren't either:

```sh
if [ "$CXXFLAGS" = "" ]; then
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
```

Unintentionally having exported but empty `CXXFLAGS` breaks **at least** MPIR, because it assumes the user had intentionally set them, so leaves them as they are (empty that is), not passing potentially important architecture and ABI flags to the C++ compiler (e.g. `-m...` flags to `g++`).

The solution is of course simple:  Don't (set and) export `CXXFLAGS` if `CFLAGS` aren't exported either.  Not sure if setting `CXXFLAGS` to `CFLAGS` in case the latter are non-empty (or empty but exported) is desirable at all.

I'd suggest to replace the above with at least

```sh
if [ "${CFLAGS+set}" = set ] && [ -z "$CXXFLAGS" ]; then
    export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
fi
```
which only sets (and exports) `CXXFLAGS` in case `CFLAGS` are set (but probably to `""`) and `CXXFLAGS` are empty.

Or only use `CFLAGS` if they're really non-empty by adding `&& [ -n "$CFLAGS" ]` or replacing `[ "${CFLAGS+set}" = set ]` by the former.
