Between the time when #15963 was merged in develop and #15963 was actually closed, I found and fixed a bug and pushed it to #15963, see [#15963 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/15963#comment:4). However, due to the race condition outlined above, this fix has never been merged.

Thus, this is a new ticket with the same fix.

For convenience, I repeat [#15963 comment:4](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/15963#comment:4):

The following behaviour is undesired (docstrings says that colors are tuples of the colors of the constituent states, but this is not the case and leads to problems in Automaton.determinisation):

```
sage: A = Automaton([[0, 0, 0]], initial_states=[0])
sage: B = A.product_FiniteStateMachine(A,
....:                                  lambda t1, t2: (0, None))
sage: B.states()[0].color
[None, None]
sage: B.determinisation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
sage: A = Automaton([[0, 0, 0]], initial_states=[0])
sage: B = A.composition(A, algorithm='explorative')
sage: B.states()[0].color
[None, None]
sage: B.determinisation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
```

I pushed commits correcting this and adding two more docstrings to emphasize that colors have to be hashable in order to be able to use Automaton.determinisation.
