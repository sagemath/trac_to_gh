Hi, i did not try to install the package, but here are a few suggestions for SPKG.txt : 

- title : gambit (lower case)
- license : GPL v2+ (easier to read)
- SPKG Maintainers : James Campbell (you are the maintainer, Theodore Turocy is the upstream author but does not maintain the sage package in the long term. By the way you should add your login on the trac homepage http://trac.sagemath.org/)
- Upstream contact : http://www.gambit-project.org/ seems more appropriate since it contains a contact link.

I installed it without problem, and could try some python examples, so it looks good to go. As minor cosmetic changes, could you just: 

- remove the line "Put a bulleted list of dependencies here:" in SPKG.txt
- chmod +x spkg-install
- In the "Upstream Contact" section, write someting like

```
 * Website: http://www.gambit-project.org/
 * Mailing list: http://sourceforge.net/p/gambit/mailman/gambit-devel/
```
(those mailing-lists are not easy to find from the website, and may be useful if one need to report some issues upstream)

At the moment there exists a Gambit branch that is exclusively for optimising gambit for sage. Any changes that are made there will hopefully be merged into Gambit's next release (due at the end of August I believe). 

The changes that have been made so far are requited for ticket #16333 and so we thought it best to switch to temporarily hosting our own version of the Gambit tarball so that when people come to review that ticket, they will be using the correct version of Gambit.

Once the next release is sorted this should not be a problem and the tarball can revert back to the one at sourceforge.net

> So... what's the status on this?  I *finally* have time to look at these tickets seriously again and would really like to do so over the next couple days - especially since the knot theory and Android app summer projects were successful :)

That would be really great Karl!

Things have been pretty busy recently and I'm only just getting back to trying to find reviewers for the two main tickets (I'm not counting this one).

I've actually had to change the url for this one to: http://vincent-knight.com/other/gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz

I'm not entirely sure I've done that right though... James took care all this and I can't say I looked in to the package stuff... He's currently away from a machine but should be able to sort this particular ticket (relevant to #16333) when he's back or if anyone is eager to review I'll figure out asap! :)

Hi both, very strange that you're getting the weird behaviour.

Completely agree that it would be idea for this to just be 'a normal' upstream binary of gambit but the reason it's this personalised version is after conversation with the main gambit dev. There needed to be a slight tweak to how the Python api worked, with a view to including this change to future versions of gambit.

When it came to hosting it the gambit maintainer said it was best (I forget if there was an actual reason) to just have it on my site. As a point of action, I'll check some things with James and get in touch with the gambit maintainer to see if we can fix this.

I'm beginning to wonder if since the main purpose of this is for #16333, but that most of #16333 works without gambit, it would be possible to modify/open new tickets so that #16333 can be review 'sans gambit' and a new ticket is opened to take care of getting gambit as an optional package in Sage and to check that the one implementation of the algorithm also works.


>

Agree that this is not high priority based on above, I've left you a message on #16331 re confusion of branches: not too sure what to do there/here... I think we were quite eager to avoid a branch mess but might have managed to create one anyway :) Sorry...

Thank you both very much for looking through this.

You can start a new branch and merge in up to some commit by using the sha1 (or cherry-pick a single commit). Although I wouldn't worry so much about having the perfect "clean" history and instead use `git diff` and

```
git log --no-merges ^develop
```
to see all commits not in develop.

> I'm going camping for 4 days tomorrow so unless I get to speak to tscrim (thank you very much for the offer) I'll leave making the change till next week just in case I make a mess that I'm not around to fix.

Nice!  Yes, next week is better for me as well.

<div id="comment:37" align="right">comment:37</div>

Getting back to this (apologies for the delay).

We're now pointing towards a 'standard' release of gambit which should work fine in the modifications to the `NormalFormGame` class that we'll start working on (shouldn't take long as code is pretty much ready).

Assuming this version of gambit installs fine and is ok (this branch is merge with latest branch of `develop` and gambit has built on two separate OSs), what would be the best way to proceed to getting gambit in to the `NormalFormGame` class.

I think there are two approaches:

1. Work on this ticket to modify `NormalFormGame` so that it has an interface to gambit. I think that this was the plan at some point but looking at some dev guidance it seems that adding a package should be a single self contained ticket.
2. Wait for this ticket to be merged in to `develop` and work on a new branch of that on a different ticket (this is my preferred option as I think it's least likely to break stuff...)

Thanks :)

You already have #16333 for the purposes of actually writing the gambit interface, as long as a few examples we test here work out properly this time I think this ticket should be *just* for adding gambit.  Maybe you could put in a couple absolutely minimal gambit-optional doctests to verify that it imports and creates a game, I guess.  This could be in a file gambit.py that just serves as a way for people to test and use it independently of Sage (though see below because of the preparser):

For instance, I still get the following (it does compile now):

```
sage: sage: import gambit
sage: sage: gambit.Game.new_tree()
EFG 2 R "" { }
""

t "" 0
sage: g.players[0].label="A"  # turns out not to work in Sage because of preparer, that's okay
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: collection indexes must be int or str, not Integer
sage: g.players[int(0)].label="A"
```
I can't find the previously non-working version in the documentation now, maybe that was changed.  For posterity, it doesn't work now.

```
sage: sage: gambit.new_tree()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-46627785e350> in <module>()
----> 1 gambit.new_tree()

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'new_tree'
```

Travis, did you try any actual gambit examples?  If these work I guess that would be enough.

Vincent, I think that the gambit documentation still leaves something to be desired.  For instance,

```
In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")
```
doesn't work right, because the file is not there (I guess).  In R and similar things there is a standard way to access such built-in examples.  Not necessary per se, but it would be nice if examples worked right.

> You already have #16333 for the purposes of actually writing the gambit interface, as long as a few examples we test here work out properly this time I think this ticket should be *just* for adding gambit.  Maybe you could put in a couple absolutely minimal gambit-optional doctests to verify that it imports and creates a game, I guess.  This could be in a file gambit.py that just serves as a way for people to test and use it independently of Sage (though see below because of the preparser):

Not too sure where the gambit.py would go but like the idea of writing tests for it: would I put it in the game_theory folder and just make sure it doesn't come up in the docs etc...?

For simplicity here is some code you can just paste in to a Sage session to test gambit:

A prisoner's dilemma:

```
sage: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(0)] = int(5)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(1)] = int(5)
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

A battle of the sexes:

```
e: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(1)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(0)] = int(1)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(1)] = int(2)
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.6666666667, 0.3333333333, 0.3333333333, 0.6666666667]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

I assume this is the sort of stuff (with more documentation) that would go in to the gambit.py file.

For info, these are examples we had checked ourselves and is what is required for us to get the LCP solver working in `NormalFormGame`.

I think that if you just added a file `game_theory/gambit.py` that explained how to use it independently of Sage, that would be fine.

In fact, you could have untested examples that show it in the Ipython setting - notebook or command line - since presumably it will work there.  In fact, I just tried it, and it does!  So if someone wanted to "just use" Gambit they could do it that way.

But if that is a lot of work, you can definitely think of that as a followup ticket, though one that would be very useful to get in before the new year (at which point I will have much less time to review such things).

I think that copy/paste some of the documentation from the Gambit site, and/or actual examples (there should be a way to mark these as not tested or not Sage tests, especially since it won't have `sage:` in front) would be best instead of this remark.

In fact, you could put that *first* and then say "if you really want to use Gambit in Sage without using the (soon-to-come) interface, do this stuff with int".

I've gone with your suggestion: moving most of the packages to Ipython as well as a discussion of how to run the Sage Ipython cli tool.

Also note that I've made the tests for `gambit.py` have the optional tag so now to run them you need:

```
./sage -t --optional=gambit src/sage/game_theory/gambit.py 
```

I thought it was worth doing this in case an overall global test of Sage would try to test this gambit file.

Not too sure what is best: I'm happy enough with letting this merge in to develop now? I don't think it's likely that many people would have a problem with it being merged as is, happy to follow your guidance. Either way work on #16333 will come from a branch of this once it's been positively reviewed.

I tried doing this but conscious to not actually want to import `gambit.py` as a Sage module, I only wanted to add it to the relevant `index.rst`. When trying to build the docs though I got an error:

Yes, I agree this is not important enough to worry on the doc for this ticket.

However, I think that there should be another way to solve it - namely, by adding a file gambit.rst to src/doc/en/reference/game_theory/ where one wouldn't have to import the module to get the doc built.  This happens in some other modules in the reference manual.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do for this one :)

I get slightly different output than what's in the prisoner's dilemma test (well, beyond my player's names):

```
NFG 1 R "Prisoners dilemma game" { "Alice" "Bob" }

{ { "1" "2" }
{ "1" "2" }
}
""

{
{ "" 0, 0 }
{ "" 0, 0 }
{ "" 0, 0 }
{ "" 0, 0 }
}
1 2 3 4 

```
I think it's equivalent, but I'm not completely sure. I'll let the final okay to Vince or Karl-Dieter.
