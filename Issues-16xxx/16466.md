Hi, i did not try to install the package, but here are a few suggestions for SPKG.txt : 

- title : gambit (lower case)
- license : GPL v2+ (easier to read)
- SPKG Maintainers : James Campbell (you are the maintainer, Theodore Turocy is the upstream author but does not maintain the sage package in the long term. By the way you should add your login on the trac homepage http://trac.sagemath.org/)
- Upstream contact : http://www.gambit-project.org/ seems more appropriate since it contains a contact link.

I installed it without problem, and could try some python examples, so it looks good to go. As minor cosmetic changes, could you just: 

- remove the line "Put a bulleted list of dependencies here:" in SPKG.txt
- chmod +x spkg-install
- In the "Upstream Contact" section, write someting like

```

At the moment there exists a Gambit branch that is exclusively for optimising gambit for sage. Any changes that are made there will hopefully be merged into Gambit's next release (due at the end of August I believe). 

The changes that have been made so far are requited for ticket #16333 and so we thought it best to switch to temporarily hosting our own version of the Gambit tarball so that when people come to review that ticket, they will be using the correct version of Gambit.

Once the next release is sorted this should not be a problem and the tarball can revert back to the one at sourceforge.net

That would be really great Karl!

Things have been pretty busy recently and I'm only just getting back to trying to find reviewers for the two main tickets (I'm not counting this one).

I've actually had to change the url for this one to: http://vincent-knight.com/other/gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz

I'm not entirely sure I've done that right though... James took care all this and I can't say I looked in to the package stuff...

I would really prefer that Sage ships an official binary offered by upstream, not a customized temporary one. What is the current status of your Sage's specific branch being merged ? If it is for not too long, i think it is worth waiting this merge.

Hi both, very strange that you're getting the weird behaviour.

Completely agree that it would be idea for this to just be 'a normal' upstream binary of gambit but the reason it's this personalised version is after conversation with the main gambit dev. There needed to be a slight tweak to how the Python api worked, with a view to including this change to future versions of gambit.

When it came to hosting it the gambit maintainer said it was best (I forget if there was an actual reason) to just have it on my site. As a point of action, I'll check some things with James and get in touch with the gambit maintainer to see if we can fix this.

I'm beginning to wonder if since the main purpose of this is for #16333, but that most of #16333 works without gambit, it would be possible to modify/open new tickets so that #16333 can be review 'sans gambit' and a new ticket is opened to take care of getting gambit as an optional package in Sage and to check that the one implementation of the algorithm also works.

Agree that this is not high priority based on above, I've left you a message on #16331 re confusion of branches: not too sure what to do there/here... I think we were quite eager to avoid a branch mess but might have managed to create one anyway :) Sorry...

Thank you both very much for looking through this.

The standard approach is to create a patch (or if there are more logical grouping, multiple patches) which apply to a clean version of gambit. As these changes get released into gambit, we remove (a part of) the patch.

You can start a new branch and merge in up to some commit by using the sha1 (or cherry-pick a single commit). Although I wouldn't worry so much about having the perfect "clean" history and instead use `git diff` and

```
git log --no-merges ^develop
```
to see all commits not in develop.

For instance, often a ticket will start off as "fix trivial error in foo - easy" and by the end become "rewrite entire functionality of bar" which then happens to have fixing the trivial error as a corollary - because that was the only way to fix the supposedly trivial error!

1. Create a new ticket that will branch directly from develop and be to implement methods that only require lrs. Ticket is here: #16954
2. Reword #16333 so that it becomes dependent on above ticket and this ticket: and implements the use of gambit. This has been done.

All these tickets have been set to 'needs work'. Fixing #16954 should not take too long (it's just cleaning and removing code).

Getting back to this (apologies for the delay).

We're now pointing towards a 'standard' release of gambit which should work fine in the modifications to the `NormalFormGame` class that we'll start working on (shouldn't take long as code is pretty much ready).

Assuming this version of gambit installs fine and is ok (this branch is merge with latest branch of `develop` and gambit has built on two separate OSs), what would be the best way to proceed to getting gambit in to the `NormalFormGame` class.

I think there are two approaches:

1. Work on this ticket to modify `NormalFormGame` so that it has an interface to gambit. I think that this was the plan at some point but looking at some dev guidance it seems that adding a package should be a single self contained ticket.
2. Wait for this ticket to be merged in to `develop` and work on a new branch of that on a different ticket (this is my preferred option as I think it's least likely to break stuff...)

Thanks :)

You already have #16333 for the purposes of actually writing the gambit interface, as long as a few examples we test here work out properly this time I think this ticket should be *just* for adding gambit.  Maybe you could put in a couple absolutely minimal gambit-optional doctests to verify that it imports and creates a game, I guess.  This could be in a file gambit.py that just serves as a way for people to test and use it independently of Sage (though see below because of the preparser):

For instance, I still get the following (it does compile now):

```
sage: sage: import gambit
sage: sage: gambit.Game.new_tree()
EFG 2 R "" { }
""

t "" 0
sage: g.players[0].label="A"  # turns out not to work in Sage because of preparer, that's okay
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: collection indexes must be int or str, not Integer
sage: g.players[int(0)].label="A"
```
I can't find the previously non-working version in the documentation now, maybe that was changed.  For posterity, it doesn't work now.

```

```

Travis, did you try any actual gambit examples?  If these work I guess that would be enough.

Vincent, I think that the gambit documentation still leaves something to be desired.  For instance,

```
In [1]: g = gambit.Game.read_game("e02.nfg")
```
doesn't work right, because the file is not there (I guess).  In R and similar things there is a standard way to access such built-in examples.  Not necessary per se, but it would be nice if examples worked right.

Not too sure where the gambit.py would go but like the idea of writing tests for it: would I put it in the game_theory folder and just make sure it doesn't come up in the docs etc...?

For simplicity here is some code you can just paste in to a Sage session to test gambit:

A prisoner's dilemma:

```
sage: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(0)] = int(5)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(1)] = int(5)
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

A battle of the sexes:

```
e: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(1)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(0)

sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.6666666667, 0.3333333333, 0.3333333333, 0.6666666667]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

I assume this is the sort of stuff (with more documentation) that would go in to the gambit.py file.

For info, these are examples we had checked ourselves and is what is required for us to get the LCP solver working in `NormalFormGame`.

I think that copy/paste some of the documentation from the Gambit site, and/or actual examples (there should be a way to mark these as not tested or not Sage tests, especially since it won't have `sage:` in front) would be best instead of this remark.

I've gone with your suggestion: moving most of the packages to Ipython as well as a discussion of how to run the Sage Ipython cli tool.

Also note that I've made the tests for `gambit.py` have the optional tag so now to run them you need:

```
./sage -t --optional=gambit src/sage/game_theory/gambit.py 
```

I thought it was worth doing this in case an overall global test of Sage would try to test this gambit file.

Not too sure what is best: I'm happy enough with letting this merge in to develop now? I don't think it's likely that many people would have a problem with it being merged as is, happy to follow your guidance. Either way work on #16333 will come from a branch of this once it's been positively reviewed.

Okay, I think this is fine, except for a few minor issues.
* Add to reference manual?
* Please recheck for duplication like

```

+    In [2]: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
```
* I have a feeling that if this is added to reference, there will be a hiccup here.

```
+Here is a list of various other solvers that can be used:
+
+- ExternalEnumPureSolver
+- ExternalEnumMixedSolver
+- ExternalLPSolver
+- ExternalLCPSolver
+- ExternalSimpdivSolver
+- ExternalGlobalNewtonSolver
+- ExternalEnumPolySolver
+- ExternalLyapunovSolver
+- ExternalIteratedPolymatrixSolver
+- ExternalLogitSolver
+
+    In [22]: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalEnumPureSolver()
+    In [23]: solver.solve(g)
+    Out[23]: [<NashProfile for '': [Fraction(0, 1), Fraction(1, 1), Fraction(0, 1), Fraction(1, 1)]>]
+
```
   Because there is what is intended to be a literal block after a list.  You should have another sentence explaining it and then the usual double colon.
* You will need to add `import gambit` before each of your Ipython examples, otherwise they don't work.

I tried doing this but conscious to not actually want to import `gambit.py` as a Sage module, I only wanted to add it to the relevant `index.rst`. When trying to build the docs though I got an error:

```

```

This makes me think that I also need to link gambit.py as a library _which I don't want to do_ (especially named as it is). Am I missing something: is there a best way to do this or should we just leave it as it is? So that it is in essence 'for developers'?
