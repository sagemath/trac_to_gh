That would be really great Karl!

Things have been pretty busy recently and I'm only just getting back to trying to find reviewers for the two main tickets (I'm not counting this one).

I've actually had to change the url for this one to: http://vincent-knight.com/other/gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz

I'm not entirely sure I've done that right though... James took care all this and I can't say I looked in to the package stuff... He's currently away from a machine but should be able to sort this particular ticket (relevant to #16333) when he's back or if anyone is eager to review I'll figure out asap! :)

Hi both, very strange that you're getting the weird behaviour.

Completely agree that it would be idea for this to just be 'a normal' upstream binary of gambit but the reason it's this personalised version is after conversation with the main gambit dev. There needed to be a slight tweak to how the Python api worked, with a view to including this change to future versions of gambit.

When it came to hosting it the gambit maintainer said it was best (I forget if there was an actual reason) to just have it on my site. As a point of action, I'll check some things with James and get in touch with the gambit maintainer to see if we can fix this.

I'm beginning to wonder if since the main purpose of this is for #16333, but that most of #16333 works without gambit, it would be possible to modify/open new tickets so that #16333 can be review 'sans gambit' and a new ticket is opened to take care of getting gambit as an optional package in Sage and to check that the one implementation of the algorithm also works.


>

Agree that this is not high priority based on above, I've left you a message on #16331 re confusion of branches: not too sure what to do there/here... I think we were quite eager to avoid a branch mess but might have managed to create one anyway :) Sorry...

Thank you both very much for looking through this.

The standard approach is to create a patch (or if there are more logical grouping, multiple patches) which apply to a clean version of gambit. As these changes get released into gambit, we remove (a part of) the patch.

I'm also for separating things out here considering the spkg doesn't seem like it will be ready soon.

This sounds sensible to me but my understanding is that we can't change the name of a trac ticket (or at least we shouldn't). If that's the case is it enough to explain in the comments what the change is to be? 

If I'm wrong and it's fine to change the name of a ticket should I just go ahead and do that?

I concur.

You can start a new branch and merge in up to some commit by using the sha1 (or cherry-pick a single commit). Although I wouldn't worry so much about having the perfect "clean" history and instead use `git diff` and

```
git log --no-merges ^develop
```
to see all commits not in develop.

Yes, absolutely one can do that, as long as it's clear why and related to the original thing.  For instance, often a ticket will start off as "fix trivial error in foo - easy" and by the end become "rewrite entire functionality of bar" which then happens to have fixing the trivial error as a corollary - because that was the only way to fix the supposedly trivial error!

<a id='comment:37'></a>Getting back to this (apologies for the delay).

We're now pointing towards a 'standard' release of gambit which should work fine in the modifications to the `NormalFormGame` class that we'll start working on (shouldn't take long as code is pretty much ready).

Assuming this version of gambit installs fine and is ok (this branch is merge with latest branch of `develop` and gambit has built on two separate OSs), what would be the best way to proceed to getting gambit in to the `NormalFormGame` class.

I think there are two approaches:

1. Work on this ticket to modify `NormalFormGame` so that it has an interface to gambit. I think that this was the plan at some point but looking at some dev guidance it seems that adding a package should be a single self contained ticket.
2. Wait for this ticket to be merged in to `develop` and work on a new branch of that on a different ticket (this is my preferred option as I think it's least likely to break stuff...)

Thanks :)

Travis, did you try any actual gambit examples?  If these work I guess that would be enough.

Vincent, I think that the gambit documentation still leaves something to be desired.  For instance,

```

Not too sure where the gambit.py would go but like the idea of writing tests for it: would I put it in the game_theory folder and just make sure it doesn't come up in the docs etc...?

For simplicity here is some code you can just paste in to a Sage session to test gambit:

A prisoner's dilemma:

```
sage: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(8)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(10)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(0)] = int(5)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(1)] = int(5)
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

A battle of the sexes:

```
e: import gambit
sage: g = gambit.Game.new_table([2,2])
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(0)] = int(2)
sage: g[int(0), int(0)][int(1)] = int(1)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(0), int(1)][int(1)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(0)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(0)][int(1)] = int(0)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(0)] = int(1)
sage: g[int(1), int(1)][int(1)] = int(2)
sage: solver = gambit.nash.ExternalLCPSolver()
sage: solver.solve(g)
[<NashProfile for '': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.6666666667, 0.3333333333, 0.3333333333, 0.6666666667]>,
 <NashProfile for '': [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]>]
```

I assume this is the sort of stuff (with more documentation) that would go in to the gambit.py file.

For info, these are examples we had checked ourselves and is what is required for us to get the LCP solver working in `NormalFormGame`.

Cool, I'll go ahead and do that: it's not a substantial amount of work so I'm happy to do it as part of this ticket or should I keep this ticket solely for the purpose of packaging the third party code?

I've gone with your suggestion: moving most of the packages to Ipython as well as a discussion of how to run the Sage Ipython cli tool.

Also note that I've made the tests for `gambit.py` have the optional tag so now to run them you need:

```
./sage -t --optional=gambit src/sage/game_theory/gambit.py 
```

I thought it was worth doing this in case an overall global test of Sage would try to test this gambit file.

> By the way, we can positively review this ticket and then put its goal to "sage-pending" waiting on #16333; this is already a prereq for that, so one can make it that dependency without having to merge this in the main develop branch right away.  Then you can preface all this with a remark (on that ticket or here) linking to `normal_form_game.py` or some of the functions there (see the developer guide for how to do this) so that curious folks mostly just go right back to where they belong, and this remains a "fyi" document only.


Not too sure what is best: I'm happy enough with letting this merge in to develop now? I don't think it's likely that many people would have a problem with it being merged as is, happy to follow your guidance. Either way work on #16333 will come from a branch of this once it's been positively reviewed.

I tried doing this but conscious to not actually want to import `gambit.py` as a Sage module, I only wanted to add it to the relevant `index.rst`. When trying to build the docs though I got an error:

```
[game_theo] /Users/vince/sage/src/doc/en/reference/game_theory/sage/game_theory/gambit.rst:11: WARNING: autodoc can't import/find module 'sage.game_theory.gambit', it reported error: "No module named gambit", please check your spelling and sys.path
```

This makes me think that I also need to link gambit.py as a library _which I don't want to do_ (especially named as it is). Am I missing something: is there a best way to do this or should we just leave it as it is? So that it is in essence 'for developers'?
