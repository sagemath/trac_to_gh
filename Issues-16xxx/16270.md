The ipython notebook is a very pleasant tool. 
I would like to use sage notebook methods to produce image in the ipython notebook?

In particular, I would like to know how the sage notebook do that.

At the end, I would like to use the ipython tools which try to find a *_repr_foo_* method.

```
from IPython.display import Image

class myObject(SageObject):

    def _repr_png_(self):
        f = produce_a_file_with_the_sage_notebook_tools(self, ...)
        return Image(f).data
```

I made some tests:

```
from IPython.display import Image
file = "/Users/elix/img.png"
def _repr_png_(self):
    latex.eval(latex(self), locals(), filename=file)
    return Image(filename=file, format='png').data

BinaryTree._repr_png_ = _repr_png_

BinaryTree([[],[[],[]]])
```
that produces 

![](http://kerios.fr/downloads/trac/imgbt.png)

but

```
e = (1 - sqrt(1 - 4*x)) / (2*x)
latex.eval(latex(e), locals(), filename=file)
```
will produce an error... so that is not the good way...
