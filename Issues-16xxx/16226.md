`Tachyon.plot` does not produce valid syntax for `tachyon_rt`.  The basic problem is that triangles are not printed correctly: they show as tuples instead.  This means that the [examples in the reference manual](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.html#sage.plot.plot3d.tachyon.Tachyon.plot) are broken.

Here is a minimal example:

```
sage: m = lambda u,v: u^2 - v^3
sage: Q = Tachyon(camera_center=(5,0,4))
sage: Q.texture('t')
sage: Q.light((-20,-20,40), 0.2, (1,1,1))
sage: Q.plot(m,(0,1),(0,1),'t',max_depth=1,initial_depth=1)
```

The string tachyon tries to render is this:

```
sage: print(Q.str())

        begin_scene
...
        light center  -20.0 -20.0 40.0 
              rad 0.2
              color  1.0 1.0 1.0 
        
(1/2, 0, 1/4) (1/2, 1/2, 1/8) (1/4, 1/4, 3/64) t(1/2, 0, 1/4) (1/2, 1/2, 1/8) (3/4, 1/4, 35/64) t
...
        end_scene

```

Instead of 3-tuples, we should see something like this:

```
...
        TRI V0  0.5 0.0 0.25   V1  0.5 0.5 0.125    V2  0.25 0.25 0.046875 
            t
        
        TRI V0  0.5 0.0 0.25   V1  0.5 0.5 0.125    V2  0.75 0.25 0.546875 
            t
...
```

Tachyon plots use `sage.plot.plot3d.tri_plot.TrianglePlot`, which prints objects with `str(o)` ([see tri_plot.py line 233](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/plot/plot3d/tri_plot.py#L233)).  

One quick fix is to add `__str__` or `__repr__` methods to `TachyonTriangle` and `TachyonSmoothTriangle` which print appropriately.  There may be a more robust fix though.

A quick and dirty fix which solves the problem at hand but ignores the larger problems of duplicated code and low coordination between `Tachyon.plot` and other surface plots in Sage.

Here's a different branch which entirely throws out `__str__` and `__repr__` for Tachyon objects.  All methods are doctested, and all tests pass in sage/plot.  I'm running (long) tests on the whole sage library now.

The plotting examples in tachyon.py are working as expected.

... aaaaand all tests pass!

Unless someone has a better idea, I can write something that prints the md5 digest of tachyon strings, and add some TEST docstrings that use it.

There seems to be a problem in one of str methods:

Doc claims to give 


`a b c da db dc color`


but the result is `[1, 2, 3] [2, 3, 4] [0, 0, 0] 0 [0, 0, 1] [0, 1, 0] [1, 0, 0]`

which looks more like `a b c color da db dc`
