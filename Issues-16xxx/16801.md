`gamma` is now converted from Sympy, the original case however takes very long to doctest. Is there a faster case that returns something with `gamma` in Sympy?

Also, additionally now, `polygamma` does not convert, as in `integrate(psi(x), x, algorithm='sympy')`.

LGTM.



all the following more direct tests work. i can add one, but don't know where exactly.

```
sage: f = 25/12 + psi(5, hold=true); f
psi(5) + 25/12
sage: f._sympy_()
-EulerGamma + 25/6
sage: f.unhold()
-euler_gamma + 25/6
sage: from sympy import Symbol, polygamma as pg
sage: bool(pg(1, x)._sage_().subs(x=1) + 1/6*pi^2 == 0)
True
