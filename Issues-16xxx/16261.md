```
sage: H = AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,2])
sage: H((2,0))
(0, 0)
sage: H(vector((2,0)))
(2, 0)

sage: H((1,0)).order()
2
sage: H(vector((1,0))).order()
+Infinity
```

With this branch there is no need to wrap a tuple into a vector to avoid the "if isinstance(x,(tuple,list))" and what should be the default behaviour IS the default behaviour. And it barely breaks doctests once one replaced the old `[G([1,2])` by `G.linear_combination_of_smith_form_gens([1,2])`

Do I misunderstand your question or are you saying that you would like to use any base you like instead of (1,0),(0,1), or the smith form ?

I just need this new form for a couple of things I am implementing... But I am afraid of having to touch these files myself, because I have a good idea of what I forgot about groups since I began a PhD in graph theory... and it scares me `:-D`

Basically, yes. The problem is that presently, AdditiveAbelianGroup is a little too lax in what it accepts as "invariants". In the classification of (finite) abelian groups, the "invariants" `[a1,a2,...,ar]` are subject to the additional condition that `ai` divides `a(i+1)`. Otherwise they aren't really invariants.

Ahahaah. Very simple : I have no idea how. I already said that I didn't feel at ease editing group code, so if you want anything more general than what is in the branch, I'm sorry to say that you will have to write the code yourself `:-)`

And I agree with you that more bases should be allowed indeed.

Oh, and if you have any idea of how to make Sage see `G = GF(8,'x').cartesian_product(GF(5))` as a group, it would be cool by the way.

```
sage: G([1,1])+G([1,1])
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'CartesianProduct_with_category.element_class' and 'CartesianProduct_with_category.element_class'
```

God.. These things are SO broken :

```
sage: list(G)          
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'list'
```

Perhaps this is the problem :

```
sage: g=GF(8,'x')              
sage: g.category()             
Category of finite fields
sage: gg=g.cartesian_product(g)
sage: gg.category()            
Category of Cartesian products of monoids
```

This `gg` should be a product of groups I guess...

Btw, do you plan on reviewing all the tickets you set to `needs_work` ?

Hey Nathann,

I gave the `short_repr` more functional-type and cleaner (IMO) implementation. I've also made some lines shorter and made line breaks at more logical positions.

As for finding the orders of the original cyclic groups in `short_repr`, I think the current implementation is okay for now. You could make this data into a (cached) method, but IDK if this is worthwhile or useful for anyone. A "better" fix would be to pass this data from the factory function to the class, but you should deal with handling old pickles which don't (a priori) contain this part of the class's input.

So in the end, if you're okay with my changes, then positive review.

A question: with the old behavior, I could do

```
G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([0,0])
G(a)
```
and have it return something sensible (and the *same* thing) whether `a` was a vector, a list, a tuple, or an element of `G`. This now gives a deprecation warning if `a` is a list or tuple. On the other hand

```
G.linear_combination_of_smith_form_gens(a)
```
gives an outright error if `a` is an element of `G`. Should I do

```
G(vector(a))
```
to recover this behavior?

I think you only got the *same* thing by coincidence, the Smith form generators happened to be chosen equal to the given basis. But we didn't make any guarantees that this was so, and for more complicated groups you'd be in for a surprise.

So if I'm working with free abelian groups, there is no way to guarantee that `G(a)` will return the same thing if `a` is the tuple (1,2), the list [1,2], the vector (1,2), or the group element (1,2)?

I bumped into this doctesting Judson's Abstract Algebra book.

```
G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([14])
b = G([2])
```

was fine for the novices, but `b = G(vector([2]))` looks more complicated than necessary.

Anybody on this ticket have a better idea?  I mean besides me ever getting my act together on #9773.

What do you mean? `G([2])` works in the latest release, and it will stay this way: we will only remove the *warning* in several months.

The meaning of the command changed, but the command itsels will remain available.
