The original environment unclobbered by Sage might be needed by subprocesses (e.g. patchbot) so just save it somewhere at the very start.

For the motivation see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/1dpr0__-ssw

Keywords: **shell, start, sandbox**

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
There are several issues:
1. Re-entrancy: when running different Sage processes, the environment of only 1 will be kept.
2. Quoting: The textual output of `env` is not suitable, since `\n` characters in environment variables cannot be reconstructed correctly. Assuming you need this for Python, why not use Python to store the environment in a Python pickle for example?
3. Why did you copy the `DOT_SAGE` stuff to `src/bin/sage`? Why not simply store the environment inside `sage-env`?
4. Your code does not support `--nodotsage`.

And could you please state more precisely which problem this solves?

I can't say I understand completely what [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/1dpr0__-ssw](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/1dpr0__-ssw) talks about, but this ticket looks like the wrong solution for that problem.

The patchbot simply should not run/compile Sage in a different source tree from what the `SAGE_*` environment variables point to.

I don't want to say that this ticket is pointless, but it should not be used to fix the patchbot issue you're having.
