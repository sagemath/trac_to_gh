On pages 159-160 of Craig Finch's [Sage beginner's book](http://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/sage-beginners-guide), he points out that matplotlib has the [usual polar plot setup](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/polar_demo.html); some of us might even remember plotting on [such graph paper](http://www.printablepaper.net/category/polar_graph) by hand...

Anyway, this should be made available in Sage as well.

Component: **graphics**
