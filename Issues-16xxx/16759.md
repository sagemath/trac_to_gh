Packages should be installed using `sage -i` from a shell, not with the `install_package()` Sage command.

For consistency in error messages, we introduce the exception `PackageNotFoundError` which should be used to signal that a package is not installed. This idea was taken from an existing but unused exception `OptionalPackageNotFoundError` (which is removed).

I would say that `sage --standard` is doing the right thing, but somehow `http://www.sagemath.org/packages/standard/` is no longer updated. The right solution is updating the website script to take into account the new git-style packages (which is certainly a different issue than the one this ticket is about).

This might be related to the case of the tarball : you use `Pillow-2.2.2.tar.gz`. it turns out that `sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums`, that computes the checksumes, will treat only lower-case-named tarballs ... except on Macs, whose filesystems will find `Pillow-2.2.2.tar.gz` when asked for `pillow-2.2.2.tar.gz`. See #18229 for discussion.

This is documented in the [Developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html), paragraph "Directory structure", that states :

> "The build scripts and associated files are in a subdirectory SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/package, where you replace package with a lower-case version of the upstream project name."

I suppose that the original Pillow porter might have been a Mac user, and that nobody caught the problem.

HTH,

Since we want to support OS X, we cannot allow different files whose names are the same except for case differences, so we cannot allow different directories `build/Pillow` and `build/PiLlOW`. So I hope it doesn't open any holes. As I suggested, maybe the script should print a warning if there are case differences between the tarball and the directory: \"Note: case mismatch between upstream/Pillow-2.2.2.tar.gz and build/pkgs/pillow.\"",

I'd keep all (Sage-internal) "package names" (i.e., folders) in `build/pkgs/` lowercase.

We should IMHO simply be more flexible w.r.t. upstream tarballs (their names and also their top-level folders).

The easiest way to achieve this is to record the upstream tarball's name as well; currently we only have `package-version.txt`, which doesn't contain anything but what we consider the version of the package.

In the long run, we wouldn't have to rename or modify upstream tarballs (which was the goal anyway), and could even provide the original URL(s) to obtain them, at least as an alternative, and also for documentation purposes.

(There's more data we could move/replicate from `SPKG.txt` into more machine-readable form, finally creating `SPKG.txt` from, or augmenting it with data from other meta-data files, such as authors, copyright, upstream contact/address for bug reports, etc.)

Unfortunately setting SAGE_SERVER is borked as well (because the mirrors still
have 'spkg/', not 'packages/', which the scripts simply ignore), but you could
use a mirror "manually":


  wget http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/sagemath/spkg/optional/pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg

  ./sage -i pyopenssl-0.13.p0.spkg   # Note the extension

```

Setting `SAGE_SERVER` leads into an endless loop: ;-)

```sh
SAGE_SERVER="http://sage.scipy.org/sage/" ./sage --optional
Using Sage Server http://sage.scipy.org/sage/packages
HTTP Error 404: Not Found



********************************************************************************



Error contacting http://sage.scipy.org/sage/packages/optional/list. Try using an alternative server.
For example, from the bash prompt try typing

   export SAGE_SERVER=http://sage.scipy.org/sage/

then try again.



********************************************************************************
```

The above [fails for a different reason](http://sage.scipy.org/), but try yourself with some other mirror...

I vote for removing the `install_package()` command. Installing packages from within Sage can never work properly anyway:
1. for some packages, you need to rebuild the Sage library, which cannot be done in Sage.
2. some packages might need a change in environment variables (e.g. `ccache`) and that can only be done if `sage-env` is re-run after installing the package.
