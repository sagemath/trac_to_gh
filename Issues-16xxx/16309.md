Fix this:

```
sage: cython("""
....: class Bla:
....:     @staticmethod
....:     def join(categories, bint as_list = False, tuple ignore_axioms=(), tuple axioms=()):
....:         pass
....: """)
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(Bla.join)
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: Unexpected EOF while parsing argument list

```
This does not happen if `join` is a bound or unbound (not static) method.

Since this will affect building the docs (see #16296), I'd say the component is "documentation".

We wouldn't need to hack that badly. We can just go with ducktyping: if `hasattr(obj,'func_code')` we're probably looking at a function (line 1292 of sageinspect.py).

It's been noted that testing for `<type 'cython_function_or_method'>` cannot be done via `isinstance`, since every cython module makes a separate version of that type (which is considered a bug but unlikely to be fixed (soon)). By the time you're checking for the name of a type you're probably better off looking for a telltale attribute.

Indeed it is a bit odd that the inspect module does type checks rather than duck typing.

That's an important information, that I will use in #16296 for the `@`abstract_method decorator.

Anyway, I suppose we need to somehow copy what is done in the inspect module, replacing the type check by duck typing.

However, the source of `Bla.join` is almost correctly determined:

```
sage: print sage_getsource(Bla.join)
    def join(categories, bint as_list = False, tuple ignore_axioms=(), tuple axioms=()):
        pass
```
This should include the decorator!

Are you sure? Getsource does exactly what `__doc__` indicates. It would be `@staticmethod`'s responsibility to modify that. However, I think cython processes `@staticmethod` specially, so you'd need to file a bug to cython for that. I do agree it would be nice to see that a method is static, but presently you'd need to write that in the docstring yourself.

You are correct in noting that `sage_getsource` for `@staticmethod` in a `.py` file does include the decorator.

Inserting the following

```python
    if hasattr(obj, 'func_code'):
        try:
            args, varargs, varkw = inspect.getargs(obj.func_code)
            return inspect.ArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, obj.func_defaults)
        except (TypeError, AttributeError):
            pass
```
then the problem is solved for static methods of Python classes defined in Cython code, however it is not solved for static methods of cdef classes and cpdef methods of cdef classes.

Problem, that is probably the reason why sage_getargspecs has problems:

```
sage: source = '    def join(categories, bint as_list = False, tuple ignore_axioms=(), tuple axioms=()): pass\n\n'
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getargspec_cython
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython(source)
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: Unexpected EOF while parsing argument list
```
and this (as I just found) boils down to this:

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _split_syntactical_unit
sage: _split_syntactical_unit('()): pass')
('())', ': pass')
```
The expected result is

```
('()', '): pass')
```

With the new branch, most problems mentioned here are fixed (and tested against), but the following remains a problem

```
sage: cython('''

....: ''')

sage: sage_getsource(Bla)

Hmm. At the moment, I tend to say that this already needs review. The problem described in the previous comment only occurs of `Bla` has no docstring, since otherwise Cython adds embedding information to the docstring.

Hence, as long as all classes in Sage get a docstring, we will have no problem. And the fix should be enough for #16296.

So, it detects `B.A` in the wrong location (reason: It tries to find the embedding information from what Cython inserted into the docstring of the class, and if this has none, then it considers the docstring of `__init__`---even if this is not defined in the class but in a super-class!).

Moreover, it cannot get the source lines of `B`, which I think is because we catch an `IOError` but not a `TypeError` raised by `inspect.getsourcelines`.

Catching the `TypeError` does not solve the example above, but it does solve a modified example: If `B` is provided with a docstring, then its source can be detected from the embedding information.

So, what we should learn: Always provide a docstring!

Hey Simon,

Once you remove line 1643:

```
....: from sage.misc.nested_class import NestedClassMetaclass
```
as it is unused in the doctest, LGTM and you can set a positive review.
