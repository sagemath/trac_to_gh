That doesn't surprise me. We tried to properly interface with libsingular's reference counting before and, while we came close, it ended up being a rather nightmarish experience. See #13447.

I am still quite hopeful that this can be fixed *if the right experts get in the same room* for a couple of days (either that or people will find out if libsingular's reference counting is fundamentally broken).

(note that #13447 is about garbage collecting rings, which are probably a little more complicated data structures. Nonetheless, there may well be components in common).
