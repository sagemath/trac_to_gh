sage: symbolic_expression(vector([1,2]))
<boom>
TypeError:
```
This is pretty uninformative, esp. when it is in [the midst of a larger computation](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23690/how-to-fit-data-to-an-arrhenius-equation/).

Instead of working on the error message, we add some code to handle vector and matrix inputs.


Depends on #14270

It's always so great to wake up to someone working on a ticket from seven years ago :-)

I agree that this is the preferred way to handle it, and on a first pass the code looks good for it.  I do have two usage questions.

```
sage: f = symbolic_expression(lambda z: z^2 + 1); f
```
Am I correct that this does *not* inject `z` into the global namespace?  This seems to be how you constructed it with `SR.var`.

Also, I'm not familiar with `SR.subring(no_variables=True)`, which is presumably what generates the "Symbolic Constants Subring".  If someone later wanted to take something like `symbolic_expression(vector(QQ, 0))` and then add it to another (zero-dimensional) vector, how would that behave?  Would it complain because it has a different base ring?  Or would it do the "obvious" thing in any of these degenerate cases?  I don't know if there is a "right" answer here (for degenerate cases), but I wanted to ask.

Finally, it could be fun to exemplify the recursive nature of the code by having a vector composed of vector functions or something.  Though I doubt that would be a real use case; this ticket is more to make sure that if people insist on making everything "symbolic" that nothing goes boom.

The coercion system takes care of it:

```
sage: vector(SR.subring(no_variables=True), 0) + vector(SR, 0) + vector(ZZ, 0)
()
sage: _.parent()
Vector space of dimension 0 over Symbolic Ring

I think I'd rather not advertise more complicated possible uses of this function at this point. I only became aware of its existence when I was looking for a preparser-less idiom for creating callable symbolic expressions (#32103).
