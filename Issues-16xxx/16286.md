Hi Nathann,

I run through the code and mainly changed some documentation. It is available at u/vdelecroix/16286 if you want to have a look it and possibly adopt it.

It becomes crazy: the functions return either a design , a troolean or an integer depending on the input... I added an OUTPUT section to make it clearer (only in OA/TD). Moreover I am not sure I like the NOTE inside the INPUT. On the one hand, it is unreadable in the console. On the other hand, in the html output the NOTE has a gray background and makes your eyes focus on it... but it is by far not the most important thing.

We forgot two `ValueError` that should be `EmptySetError` inside the MOLS constructor. I changed it.

Inside the TESTS of transversal design, you modified the loop to not test the case where the function should return `True`. As the loop is designed to **test** if it the case I did the change backward. Nevertheless, I added a line that checks that we got the correct value when `k=None`.

I added more examples and hope that what does the function looks clearer when somebody reads the documentation. In particular, most of the TESTS section are now useless and I just removed them.

Vincent

Yo !

> I run through the code and mainly changed some documentation. It is available at u/vdelecroix/16286 if you want to have a look it and possibly adopt it.

Yep, no problem.

> It becomes crazy: the functions return either a design , a troolean or an integer depending on the input... 

True, but I think that without reading the doc you can guess what you will find, or at least correctly interpret the output. So well, doesn't matter ;-)

Besides, with the doctest you quickly see what it means.

> I added an OUTPUT section to make it clearer (only in OA/TD). Moreover I am not sure I like the NOTE inside the INPUT. On the one hand, it is unreadable in the console. On the other hand, in the html output the NOTE has a gray background and makes your eyes focus on it... but it is by far not the most important thing.

Ahahaahah. Well, to be honest I just want all these patches to be merged, then we will clean stuff. Each time you add a doctest I have to rewrite it one thousand times because the new constructions break it. It's over-documented and over-tested at the moment I believe, but it is not a problem. We have time.

> We forgot two `ValueError` that should be `EmptySetError` inside the MOLS constructor. I changed it.

Thanks ! I am still not used to those `EmptySetError`

> Inside the TESTS of transversal design, you modified the loop to not test the case where the function should return `True`. As the loop is designed to **test** if it the case I did the change backward. Nevertheless, I added a line that checks that we got the correct value when `k=None`.

You are testing a loop ? Yes of course, everything can fail.

> I added more examples and hope that what does the function looks clearer when somebody reads the documentation. In particular, most of the TESTS section are now useless and I just removed them.

OKayyyyyyyy. Well for me it is good to go, too. I am eager to see it stabilize, right now I have so many versions of this code in my head that I barely know what is already there and what is left to implement.

Thanks !
