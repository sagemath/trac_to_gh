This commit creates a `difference_matrices` module which does not do much at the moment: it can creates DM for prime powers, and return DM from the database.

In the database, however, a lot changes as many OA were actually difference matrices. The constructors are turned into difference matrices constructors, and `orthogonal_array` now calls `difference_matrix` to get them.

All in all what this patch does is mostly code administration, but well, that's the way to go ...

Quasi-difference matrices will be handled later as there are some problems with them, in particular in the way `orthogonal_array` will query the future `quasi_difference_matrix` constructor.

Hi Nathann,

Very nice that you did that!

I guess that difference matrices are interesting only over Abelian groups. Is that true? It would be nice to coordinate with difference families for input/output. For example, in #16802, in the database, you can ask a difference family with a given group and not only a fixed cardinality. It is not perfect, but I tried to start involving the group...

Yo !

I have no idea about that, but all examples I saw were on abelian groups indeed.

Hmmmmm... So a structure like that ?

```
DM_constructions = {
   order_of_the_group : {
     signature_of_the_abelian_group: [
         (k1,matrix_constructor1),
         (k2,matrix_constructor2)
         ]
     }
}
```

Having several difference families/matrices or OA and stuff is a hobby of yours, you know ? To me it's just not the interesting direction `:-P`

It can be done anyway but we have to do that later, this heap of patches is really getting dangerous. Plus Travis wrote a patch that is totally incompatible with this one, and there are like 10 tickets in linear order an `needs_review` at the moment `:-P`

Might be better than what I did... I used ` {signature: DF} `

Sometimes it is very important that your group is cyclic (for difference families or difference matrix)... so you want to be able to ask a given difference X over a cyclic group only.

I did
- removed `TD_6_12`

As a consequence, doc builds... and test still pass.

If you like it, set to positive review.
