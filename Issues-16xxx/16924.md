Hello,

seems to be done in `sympy` (which is shipped with Sage)

```
sage: from sympy.logic.utilities.dimacs import load
sage: load('1 2 \n 3')
And(Or(cnf_1, cnf_2), cnf_3)
```
But I do not know how `sympy` fits with the current SAT stuff in Sage.

I think file objects are a rare thing in the Sage "API", i.e. as far as I know we don't usually use them. I'm not sure there should be two methods, just one with a filename. Also, aren't "read" and "load" a bit too generic as names given that these are methods on solver instances?

Thanks for the comment.

I wasn't sure about the kind of use case this class gets. You mentioned in a comment that you sometimes use files on the order of gigabytes. I thought it might be useful to have easy access to a method which you only need a stream in case you don't have a disk file (for example a memory mapped file object, a StringIO file object, or some kind of stream from stdin). I don't know if you can open those with `fopen`.

However, if you think that most people just read from a file on the disk, then I could easily remove the `load` function.

As for the `read` name, I used `read` because there was already a `write` method and it seemed complementary. Do you think `parse` is a better name?

Hello,

The docstring of the function should follow the scheme

```
def my_function(x,y,z):
    r"""
    one line description

    longer description if needed

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: my_function(1,2,3)
```

The following is not helpful in the documentation

```
See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16924
```
It would make sense in an `AUTHOR` section. Or within the `TESTS` section if it would correspond to some bug fix. Moreover, the syntax is now <code>trac:\`16924\`</code>.

In your example, I do not understand what you want to show.

```
sage: solver.read(file_object)
sage: solver
DIMACS Solver: ''
```
It seems that nothing happened... Would it be possible to print the clauses?

Vincent

I hardly found specification for DIMACS files. In http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html they say several things that you are not taking care of:
- the comments should only be at the begining
- there is one line starting with `p cnf NUM_VAR NUM_CLAUSES` (the same format is used for other constraint satisfcation problems)
- a clause might extend on more than one line and a clause might start on the same line as another one

In other words, as far as I understand, this would be valid

```
c hey
c ho
p cnf 3 2
1 -2 0 3
1   0
```

Moreover, it is written *In some examples of CNF files, the rule that the variables are numbered from 1 to N is not followed. The file might declare that there are 10 variables, for instance, but allow them to be numbered 2 through 11.*

It would be nice if you know some link with the exact specification of the format.

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A23):
> - the comments should only be at the begining


Why enforce that restriction when there is no harm (as far as I can see) in being more liberal?

> - there is one line starting with `p cnf NUM_VAR NUM_CLAUSES` (the same format is used for other constraint satisfcation problems)


As far as I know, many parsers these days ignore this (source: I chatted to Máté Soos ages ago, I might be misremembering, though)

> - a clause might extend on more than one line and a clause might start on the same line as another one


I did not know about that one.

I very naively read the web page I mentioned. I am fine with the current state, but I just wanted to be sure that anybody (that uses this format) agrees with this parser. And of course, I an not the required person to judge that.

One option would be to write down in the docstring that the DIMACS format is not well specified.

Sorry it took me a while, I'm at a Sage days working on other things. But I asked people here and got directed to a SAT solver competition website [http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html).

I copied their rules here

- The file can start with comments, that is lines begining with the character c.
- Right after the comments, there is the line p cnf nbvar nbclauses indicating that the instance is in CNF format; nbvar is the exact number of variables appearing in the file; nbclauses is the exact number of clauses contained in the file.
- Then the clauses follow. Each clause is a sequence of distinct non-null numbers between -nbvar and nbvar ending with 0 on the same line; it cannot contain the opposite literals i and -i simultaneously. Positive numbers denote the corresponding variables. Negative numbers denote the negations of the corresponding variables.

The clause about "ending with 0 on the same line" means they don't allow the multi-line clauses. So it sounds like the definition of "DIMACS standards" depends on who you ask.

I will modify the docstring to clearly describe the variation it assumes the file is in. 

Should I post links to these pages describing different rules for DIMACS files in the docstring as well?

EDIT: Sorry I realized I copied the wrong link. Here is the corect one: [http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html)

I added some lines to the documentation for the read method which explains the differences in DIMACS files with links to various "standards". I rebuilt the docs and everything seemed to be formatted alright.

I thought the method Martin wrote is flexible and simple enough that it wasn't worth it to call (and sweat over) GLPK's definition of DIMAC files. Thank you for pointing out another source though Nathann!
