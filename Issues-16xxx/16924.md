Sage writes dimacs files (for SAT solvers) but doesn't seem to read them.

Hello,

seems to be done in `sympy` (which is shipped with Sage)

```
sage: from sympy.logic.utilities.dimacs import load
sage: load('1 2 \n 3')
And(Or(cnf_1, cnf_2), cnf_3)
```
But I do not know how `sympy` fits with the current SAT stuff in Sage.

I think file objects are a rare thing in the Sage "API", i.e. as far as I know we don't usually use them. I'm not sure there should be two methods, just one with a filename. Also, aren't "read" and "load" a bit too generic as names given that these are methods on solver instances?

Thanks for the comment.

I wasn't sure about the kind of use case this class gets. You mentioned in a comment that you sometimes use files on the order of gigabytes. I thought it might be useful to have easy access to a method which you only need a stream in case you don't have a disk file (for example a memory mapped file object, a StringIO file object, or some kind of stream from stdin). I don't know if you can open those with `fopen`.

However, if you think that most people just read from a file on the disk, then I could easily remove the `load` function.

As for the `read` name, I used `read` because there was already a `write` method and it seemed complementary. Do you think `parse` is a better name?

Hello,

The docstring of the function should follow the scheme

```
def my_function(x,y,z):
    r"""
    one line description

    longer description if needed

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: my_function(1,2,3)
```

The following is not helpful in the documentation

```
See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16924
```
It would make sense in an `AUTHOR` section. Or within the `TESTS` section if it would correspond to some bug fix. Moreover, the syntax is now <code>trac:\`16924\`</code>.

In your example, I do not understand what you want to show.

```
sage: solver.read(file_object)
sage: solver
DIMACS Solver: ''
```
It seems that nothing happened... Would it be possible to print the clauses?

Vincent

I hardly found specification for DIMACS files. In http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html they say several things that you are not taking care of:
- the comments should only be at the begining
- there is one line starting with `p cnf NUM_VAR NUM_CLAUSES` (the same format is used for other constraint satisfcation problems)
- a clause might extend on more than one line and a clause might start on the same line as another one

In other words, as far as I understand, this would be valid

```
c hey
c ho
p cnf 3 2
1 -2 0 3
1   0
```

Moreover, it is written *In some examples of CNF files, the rule that the variables are numbered from 1 to N is not followed. The file might declare that there are 10 variables, for instance, but allow them to be numbered 2 through 11.*

It would be nice if you know some link with the exact specification of the format.

Why enforce that restriction when there is no harm (as far as I can see) in being more liberal?

> - there is one line starting with `p cnf NUM_VAR NUM_CLAUSES` (the same format is used for other constraint satisfcation problems)

As far as I know, many parsers these days ignore this (source: I chatted to Máté Soos ages ago, I might be misremembering, though)

I did not know about that one.

I very naively read the web page I mentioned. I am fine with the current state, but I just wanted to be sure that anybody (that uses this format) agrees with this parser. And of course, I an not the required person to judge that.

One option would be to write down in the docstring that the DIMACS format is not well specified.

Sorry it took me a while, I'm at a Sage days working on other things. But I asked people here and got directed to a SAT solver competition website [http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html).

I copied their rules here

- The file can start with comments, that is lines begining with the character c.
- Right after the comments, there is the line p cnf nbvar nbclauses indicating that the instance is in CNF format; nbvar is the exact number of variables appearing in the file; nbclauses is the exact number of clauses contained in the file.
- Then the clauses follow. Each clause is a sequence of distinct non-null numbers between -nbvar and nbvar ending with 0 on the same line; it cannot contain the opposite literals i and -i simultaneously. Positive numbers denote the corresponding variables. Negative numbers denote the negations of the corresponding variables.

The clause about "ending with 0 on the same line" means they don't allow the multi-line clauses. So it sounds like the definition of "DIMACS standards" depends on who you ask.

I will modify the docstring to clearly describe the variation it assumes the file is in. 

Should I post links to these pages describing different rules for DIMACS files in the docstring as well?

EDIT: Sorry I realized I copied the wrong link. Here is the corect one: [http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html)
