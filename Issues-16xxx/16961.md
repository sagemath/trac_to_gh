```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC, 1)
H = Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2+(1+CC.0)*y^2,y^2])
f.dynatomic_polynomial(2)
``` 
returns the wrong answer

Two things for now. This does not pass its doc tests, so run them and fix them.

2nd, you went overboard on the spaces. If you want to look at the actual conventions see:

The 2nd todo block is not needed (the one in the examples) because that is already said in the main todo block.

Also, the affine ones are still not working for complex values, although the issue appears to stem from homogenize and should be fixed with trac #16838. Is this ticket merged with the latest develop so that you have the fixes from 16838?

```
A.<x>=AffineSpace(CC,1)
H=Hom(A,A)
f=H([x^2+CC.0])
f.dynatomic_polynomial(2)
```

btw, the affine examples are lacking ' = ' in the examples, so you could address that at the same time.

I hate to say it, but there is something wrong with the spacing of the dynatomic polynomial examples in affine_morphism. They are not type setting correctly. Probably the '::' need to be back farther.

Otherwise the functionality checks out. The merge with the latest beta fixed the affine issues.
