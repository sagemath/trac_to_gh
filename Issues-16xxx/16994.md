As discussed in https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/os1LzBjsYnQ/discussion, here is a ticket to implement a function that returns, given a boolean monotone function `f` on the subsets of a set `X`, all subsets `S` of `X` such that `f(S)` is True.

The implementation assumes that `f` is very costly to evaluate, and so caches as much as possible. It can also compute in parallel.

Here it is, at long last. I also removed the `**kwds` from `SimplicialComplex`, because I hate to see things like that work:

```
sage: SimplicialComplex(aergahgae="erharh")
Simplicial complex with vertex set () and facets {()}
```

It is the kind of things that makes you waste 30minutes over a typo in the function's input.

These days I try to keep the amount of wars I start to a minimum.

I also want to stop fighting other people on their own grounds. I noticed that it decreased my chances of actually achieving anything, even when I am right.

I was wondering what was the difference between "any" and "exists" and I found that in the docstring of "exists":

```
   Note that this function is NOT suitable to be used in an if-
   statement or in any place where a boolean expression is expected.
   For those situations, use the Python built-in
```

I don't understand why, however `O_o`

Hmmm... Funny. Your simplicial complex is a `(21,6,12)`-BIBD. And not one that we already have in the database.

```
sage: l=map(Set, designs.ProjectiveGeometryDesign(2,1,GF(4,name='a')))         
sage: S=SimplicialComplex(from_characteristic_function=(lambda S: not any(Set(S).intersection(x).cardinality()>2 for x in l), range(21))) # long time
sage: IS=IncidenceStructure([list(x) for x in s.maximal_faces()])
sage: IS.is_t_design(return_parameters=True)
(True, (2, 21, 6, 12))
sage: (21,6,12) in sage.combinat.designs.database.DF
False
```

I mean: currently the BIBD constructor does not even accept a `lambda` parameter, but we could have had a difference family for it.

```
sage: (0,9,10,12,16,13,18,11,7,8,1,4,5,3,2,15,19,6,14,20,17) in IS.automorphism_group()
True
```

And it turns out that there is a cyclic automorphism acting on the hypergraph, so there IS such a difference family.

Hmmmm....

this is not too surprising: these are the 168 octads containing a pair from a 
given triple of points in the famous Steiner system S(5,8,24) on 24 points.

> And it turns out that there is a cyclic automorphism acting on the hypergraph, so there IS such a difference family.


yep, there got to be lots of such automorphisms (the full group of automorphisms is quite big).
