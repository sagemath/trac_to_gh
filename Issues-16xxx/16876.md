Currently, cocharge is not calculated correctly for type A<sub>2n</sub><sup>(2)\dagger</sup>. The cocharge should be half of the virtual.

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(CartanType(['A',4,2]).dual(), [[1,1],[2,2]])
sage: for mg in RC.module_generators:
....:     mg.cocharge()
....:     mg.to_virtual_configuration().cocharge()
....:     print ""

```
Also rigged configurations for type D<sub>4</sub><sup>(3)</sup> and other relabelled types aren't well supported, but is solved with better handling of the index set.

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['D',4,3], [[1,1]])
sage: RC.module_generators
(
   
(/)
   
(/)
   
)
```
There should be another generator.

This also makes `use_half_width_boxes_type_B` into a global option (as it should've been done in #16324, but I forgot). It also makes the latex of a rigged configuration respect the French convention.
