CC:  @vbraun @dimpase @ingolfured @novoselt

Some users reported two problems with Sage's interface with LP solvers.

1) It is slow to add constraints one by one to the solver's data structure

2) It should be possible to add a matrix of constraints all at once

With a new syntax like that (thanks Dima), both problems can be circumvented:

```
p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
x = p.new_variable()
p.add_constraint(A_matrix*x <= a_vector)
```

This would consider `x` as the vector `x[0],x[1],...,x[size_of_the_matrix - 1]`.

In the `add_constraint` function, we can then call the backend's function to add 10 000 constraints at the same time (probably better for the data structure), and then fill the entries.

I don't understand `O_o`

We do not mind if two matrices are multiplied, we mind when two LP variables are multiplied together. We just have to scream when two variables are multiplied, don't we ? So if a guy multiplies two matrices containing variables it will try to multiply the variables at some point so we are safe, aren't we ?

I've started with tensors (over the base ring) of linear functions and free modules. This implements:

```
sage: m = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]);  m
[1 2]
[3 4]
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: v = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: m.row(0) * v[0]              # vector * linear function
(1.0, 2.0)*x_0
sage: m * v[0]                     # matrix * linear function
[x_0   2*x_0]
[3*x_0 4*x_0]
sage: v * m                        # MIPVariable * matrix
(3.0, 4.0)*x_1 + (1.0, 2.0)*x_0
```
The last multiplication including MIPvariables is incomplete: You can't write `m * v` since MIPvariables do not fit into the parent/element framework, so they don't really participate in coercion. This needs to be fixed, probably best by making MIPvariables the elements of the parent MixedIntegerLinearProgram. Once that is done it'll be easy to add (in)equalities of the new tensor elements.

Can it result in any slowdown for the usual usage of those variables ?

I'd be surprised.
The real bottleneck is in interacting with the solver and solving itself, anyway.

Besides, the current prevalent use of MIP frontend is very inefficient, as you collect the linear system into a matrix, internally, and the backend is called each time a new constraint is added, right? It's certainly quicker to pass the matrix directly and call the backend once.

Well, I need to compute a max matching on a large bipartite graph for some designs I build these days, and ...

```
sage: g=graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(100,200)
sage: %time _=g.matching(algorithm="LP", verbose=2)
...

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.17 sec. (104.83 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.17 sec. (104.83 ticks)
CPU times: user 1.25 s, sys: 24 ms, total: 1.28 s
Wall time: 1.06 s
```

Sage reports more than 1second and the solver report 0.17. I don't really know where the computations go to be honest at %prun does not say much. And I suspect that it does not say much because the code that takes time is written in Cython, i.e. the LP variables. But I haven't found a proof yet.

It may be faster, but the two must be possible. You don't want to have to build a matrix for any of these problems, the code would be ugly as hell. Being able to index variables with "anything" certainly adds something, and not only for readability.

Come on, it is implemented e.g. here: [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.matching.maximal_matching.html#networkx.algorithms.matching.maximal_matching)

Convert your graph into networkx one and call it...
Although indeed this might not be the fastest implementation around, sure.

No, that is Edmond's algorith for general graphs (it is not bipartite-specific) and it is also the default algorithm called by `Graph.matching` in case. Plus it's pure Python.

Although Hungarian isn't the fastest guy in town.

Volker you make mistakes too, and if there is something I don't stand for long it is people giving me orders. If there is a misunderstanding, we will clear it.

What I said is that people (some I met, or myself in the past) noticed that it took time to add constraints to a LP. I am not talking of solving the LP itself. Just imagine that the matrix is stored as a dense contiguous matrix, and that adding a row means having to copy everything.

I don't know if this is how it is implemented, but on some occasions adding constraints one by one (each with the same number of nonzero coefficients and looking the same) takes a time which is not constant per call, i.e. calling `add_constraint` on a matrix that is already big is longer than on an empty matrix.

Which means that calling add_linear_constraints may make a difference. Which would also explain why the solvers contain this in their API, even though it seems useless at first.

I just tried it again by adding the same constraint "b[3]<=8" many many times but in this case the time seems to be constant. Perhaps there is something else missing.

GLPK: takes only a number of rows as an argument. Nothing else

```
glp_add_rows(self.lp, number)

Cplex: takes a number of rows and the corresponding upper/lower bound. Plus names

```
CPXnewrows(self.env, self.lp, number, bound, sense, rng, c_names if names else NULL) #

GUROBI does have [`GRBaddconstrs`](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/5.6/reference-manual/c_grbaddconstrs) which a full thing, in the sense you can specify a bunch of constraints, specified by a sparse matrix, at once.

there is [`CPXaddrows`](http://web.njit.edu/all_topics/Prog_Lang_Docs/cplex80/doc/refman/html/addrows.html) in CPLEX, similar to the one in GUROBI.

Great! 

How does one recover the original matrices x[i]'s are multiplied with? I see that now each constraint gets .rhs which is a matrix of linear forms. For SDP backends one would typically want the original matrices. (Of course they can still be found...)

For matrix-valued linear functions you get the coefficient matrices in the usual way:

```
sage: m = x[0] * matrix([[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,0]])
sage: m.dict()[0]
[0.0 0.0 1.0]

Yo Dima ! If you happen to write a LP-related ticket, could you do that ?

```diff
+++ b/src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx
@@ -1183,7 +1183,7 @@ cdef class MixedIntegerLinearProgram(SageObject):
             if b.is_variable_integer(i):
                 var_type = 'an integer'
             elif b.is_variable_binary(i):
-                var_type = 'a boolean variable'
+                var_type = 'a boolean'
             else:
                 var_type = 'a continuous'
             if varid_name[i] == str(self.gen(i)):
```

Otherwise we get stuff like that :

```
sage: p.show()
Maximization:
 
Constraints:
  x_0 <= 1.0
Variables:
  x_0 is a boolean variable variable (min=0.0, max=1.0)
```

And it does not seem worth a ticket of its own...
