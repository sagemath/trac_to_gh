I will trust you that there are cases where this is all that the users needs.

Can we add to the documentation more from the documentation of pari's ellgroup() function?  As I understand that, if ellgroup()[2] has length 1 then the group is cyclic and this point does generate it;  while if it has length 2 then the first point has order d1 = exponent, the structure is [d1,d2] with d2>1 and d1|d1, and the Weil pairing between the points has order exactly d2 even though the second "generator" may have order not d2 (its order must then be a multiple of d2 and a divisor of d1).

As the pari doc says, this avoids the possibly expensive Weil pairing step.

I will be testing this shortly.

Perhaps this ticket should be dependent on #16931, which is referred to in comments in the code?

I would like to see and Example where the product of the orders of the two generators is greater than the cardinality.  But maybe since the gens returned are random, this cannot be tested deterministically.  That is a pity, but we could have something like

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(41),[2,5])
sage: P,Q = E.gens()
sage: P.order()
22
sage: Q.order()
22
sage: P.order()*Q.order(), E.cardinality()
(484, 44)
```

More importantly: suppose that I had done this before calling E.gens():

```
sage: E.abelian_group()
Additive abelian group isomorphic to Z/22 + Z/2 embedded in Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 5 over Finite Field of size 41
sage: E.abelian_group().gens()
((35 : 33 : 1), (10 : 0 : 1))
sage: P,Q = E.abelian_group().gens()
sage: P.order(),Q.order()
(22, 2)
```

i.e. I had done the hard work, but it was ignored.  Surely the new faster E.gens() would be even faster in this case if it checked whether generators were already known?

I convert `_pari_` to `__pari__` which fixed some of the failing doctests.

The doctests for `E.gens()` sometimes fails but I've verified that in those case, the outputs are still generators of the elliptic curve. I think it was mentioned earlier that the outputs are expected to be random. Is there a better way to do the doctest in L1248 and L1251 of ell_finite_field.py?
