Currently the creation of animations depends on external tools: either [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) or [FFmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) must be available. Either of these can be used to assemble a sequence of PNG frames into a GIF animation. However, GIF is a very limited format, and the conversion (I guess mostly the color reduction) takes time and costs quality.

A more modern alternative would be [APNG](https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification). It's an extension of the PNG standard. One drawback is that only [some browsers support it](http://caniuse.com/#feat=apng). The others would show the first frame of the animation as still image instead. (We could later extend the code so one can specify any image of equal size to be used as fallback.)

Assembling multiple PNG files into a single animation is fairly simple. In fact so simple that it can be accomplished without using any external libraries at all. I wrote such an implementation while working on #16533 and would like to offer it here for inclusion.

The branch I'm going to append uses commits from #16570 and #16645, so if those get merged before, you will have less to review here.

Rebased onto #16645. There are a lot of commits from the dependencies listed above. Only three commits are excludive to this ticket here, so [these are the changes](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/?h=a60fe0b14aa4094c86c5efb387f9fd5a9706a218&id2=bb7307f0649cfa90916f74c102d1d09a424b759a) that need to be reviewed in this ticket here.

At the moment, the APNG support isn't integrated with the `save` and `show` methods. I'd do so based on #7298, but in order to avoid dependency hell, I'll deal with this in a separate ticket so you can review the changes here independently.

I'm less worried about stability and more worried about market share. If one day MNG gets widely adopted, it might make APNG superfluous. But I don't see that coming soon.

Fine with me. I will include it in my next commit. I guess that in the long run, I might also add a method which I'd have called `fallback` or `still`, which can be used to set the fallback image to something other than the first frame. Would you prefer `set_still` or `add_fallback` or something like this?

Oh, I hadn't realized that. Sure, will move that.

Mentioned that problem in [comment:3](#comment%3A3). I can try to come up with some doctests if you insist, but they'd be pretty ugly to read.

By the way, should I prepend a `_` to all my internal methods?

> * Not sure if it's part of this ticket, but I really think [converting a generator to a list when rendering frames](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a60fe0b14aa4094c86c5efb387f9fd5a9706a218) is a bad idea.

Quoting from the commit message of that commit: “The APNG pipeline requires the number of frames up front”. I guess I could also save the *number* of frames, instead of the frames themselves. Would you prefer that? It would even be consistent with the doctest.

An inferior alternative would be copying what `graphics_array()` does:

```
        frame_list = list(self._frames)
        n = len(frame_list)
```

There you also have to maintain the list of all frames in memory, although arguably only for the duration of the method call. What I consider even more harmful, however, is the fact that the frames will be generated multiple times. In my opinion, a generator should only be traversed once for the workflow from construction to APNG output, and that one occurrence should be when building the PNGs.

well, we have to have doctests . . . even if humans don't read them, they're very useful in making sure that new code doesn't break old code.  When writing them, think "What is a machine-checkable way to ensure that this method is producing what it claims to produce?"  The current doctest for `APngAssembler` is probably overkill.

It's sort of a grey area . . . the key difference is that underscore methods won't show up in the reference manual, for better or worse.

If you can do that without loading them all into memory, that would be great

right

I fully agree.  Ideally, this is done one item at a time, rather than loading all frames into memory simultaneously.

Mozilla terminology is talking about a “default image” which either is the first frame or “not part of the animation”. So I'm looking for a name to set a default image which is not part of the animation. `set_default_image`? My main concern here is the verb, since this sounds like a simple setter with no heavy lifting.

I've started to write a doctest for each of my methods, see [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/animate.py?id=5786dcf2a441ebf81578b7c54ec02031c60e7f37#n961) for the current state of affairs.

But this fixes the internal mechanics of the whole class into the doctest, i.e. I'm testing *how* things get done, not only that they get done. This feels wrong.

Should I somehow indicate that the test for these is somewhere else?

I've just [posted to sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/TtMkK6MTrOM) to obtain some broader input on this question of doctest granularity.

There is one other problem with the doctests as they currently are: Sphinx is choking on them.

```
[plotting ] Sphinx error:
[plotting ] 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0x89 in position 683: ordinal not in range(128)
Error building the documentation.
```

I have no idea why Sphinx is trying to decode a string literal here, but this might make doctests using binary data almost impossible. Which means that I'll likely have to build the data in question from some `struct` calls, or write a helper function to convert largish chunks of hex to binary, or whatever.

I rebased this branch and reordered my commits. Now I can more easily amend the latest commit. And I can also provide a stable link to [the changes which need reviewing here](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/?h=u/gagern/ticket/16571&id2=bc9f6817c788390bec1a4388b73a191819ab67bb), based on the merge which is now the first commit not shared with some other ticket.

The core currently has two major tests for the `APngAssembler` class, one for each public method. These will test all the internal methods as well. I realized that my Sphinx problems were due to the fact that I started my docstring with `"""` not `r"""`. But by that time I had my tests converted to make use of the `h2b` utility function, and I found that the file content looked far more readable in that format, so I kept it.

Specific input: Write a doctest for every method.  The feedback from [this sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/TtMkK6MTrOM) was uniform on this point, and I think it would be unwise to ignore it.

Can you write a function which sets up a test state, or load a pickled test state?  I believe this is what Volker was indicating when he mentioned [fixtures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture).

And if one of them breaks, and you're not around to fix it, how will someone figure out what's broken?

The same way the internal workings behind any other public interface are fixed: by reading the docstring of the public interface, by examining the failing doctest of the public interface if there is any, by reading the comments (and in case of internal methods even docstrings) of the internal code, and by understanding the portion of internal code relevant to the problem.

Sorry, but users using code which is clearly designated internal are on their own. You can't take an arbitrary Sage object, mess directly with its internal state and hope for the result to behave in any reasonable way. Why would internal methods be any different?

If a sage developer at some point realizes that code could be reused by making a private method public, then that method should get doctested as well. But the same again holds for any piece of code: if some developer finds that a certain portion of an existing method could be reused, he's welcome to factor that out into a new public method and add doctests for it. Again I see no difference here, except that by adding doctests to internal methods I suggest that I might be willing to guarantee certain internal behavior in the future. Which I'm not, as long as the public interface remains.

Sorry for the rant. I'm still far from happy with this strict requirement. But since you are right and the mailing list feedback confirmed that requirement, I'm trying to make the best of it, and here it is. Now every method has a doctest, and every doctest shows the tested method in action. Can you give this a positive review?

This is looking good to me: tests are good, functionality is good, code is clean and straightforward.  HTML documentation looks fine too.  I'm running automated doctests now, but don't expect any problems.

The only thing preventing me from positive review is that the tracer stuff really belongs on a separate ticket.  When that's split into a separate ticket, I'll give them both positive reviews (modulo issues with the tracer stuff, below).  As a very minor point, I think it would be useful if you put the date and a short description of your contribution in the AUTHORS block.  Obviously this isn't always done, and isn't necessary, but I saw it recommended at some point and I think it's helpful.  If you don't want to do it, that's fine.

Comments on `fixtures.py`:

* The function `traceMethod` should be `trace_method` to fit the standard naming convention.  Was there a strong reason for the name you gave it?  If not, please change.

* `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.__init__` and `PropertyAccessTracerProxy.fmt` need docstrings

* An author block and a copyright block are necessary at the top of the file.  See [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files).

* While you're at it, why not expand the documentation?  This could be useful much more generally, and a very short description at the top of the document would help explain what it does.

* It doesn't make sense to leave `fixtures.py` out of the reference manual.  I think you add it by adding a line in `src/doc/en/reference/doctest/index.rst`, but I may be misremembering.

> It's in fact a bug in code from #17571 where I hadn't covered all aspects in the doctests. Do I need a new review just for that last rename, or can you merge it as is?


The error is just caused by a function renaming on #17571 (which was not caught because doctesting was insufficient.)  The latest commit fixes the error (use correct function name) and improves an existing doctest to check it.  

To summarize: a trivial bug in `fixtures.py` (code from #17571) was caught and fixed in the course of addressing this ticket.

I'm happy to give it positive review.
