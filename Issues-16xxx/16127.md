Comparison of PARI rationals is seriously broken:

```
sage: pari(1/2) < pari(1/3)
True
sage: pari(1) < pari(1/2)
True
```
Furthermore,the following PARI series and *p*-adics are incorrectly considered to be non-zero by `==` and `!=`:

```
sage: a = pari('O(x)'); a, a.type()
(O(x), 't_SER')
sage: b = pari('O(2)'); b, b.type()
(O(2), 't_PADIC')
sage: a.gequal(0)
True
sage: b.gequal(0)
True
sage: a == 0
False  # should be True
sage: b == 0
False  # should be True
```
These bugs are caused by `__cmp__()` calling the function `gcmp_sage()` in `sage/libs/pari/misc.h` (custom replacement for PARI's `gcmp()`), which uses string comparison for all types other than `t_INT` and `t_REAL`.

A possible solution is to implement `gen._richcmp_c_impl()` and to fix `gen._cmp_c_impl()` to use the standard PARI `gcmp()` instead of `gcmp_sage()`.  This requires catching PARI "forbidden comparison" errors.  There is actually a non-negligible speed-up if no such error occurs, but a substantial penalty if an error does occur.

There is a nice speedup in most cases that do not involve a `PariError`, including practically all equality testings.  However, the slowdown in the cases where it does occur is probably not acceptable.  Maybe it is better to write a variant of `gcmp_sage()` that calls `gcmp()` and catches errors using PARI's `pari_CATCH` and `pari_TRY` macros so that we don't have to raise Python exceptions.

Is it really *raising* the exception or it is *handling* the exception which takes a long time? If it's the second case, we might try some Cython machinery to speed up handling the exception.

I ended up practically copying the existing (static) `gen2.c:gequal_try()` and calling it `gcmp_try()`.  PARI already has another (somewhat different) universal comparison function `cmp_universal()`; I don't think the PARI library currently has a use for this `gcmp_try()`.

New branch coming soon, but here are the new timings (same notation as in[comment:5](#comment%3A5)), which leave nothing more to wish for in my opinion:

It seemed to be best to add the new functions `gcmp_try()` and `gcmp_string()` as inline functions to `sage/libs/pari/misc.h`, replacing `gcmp_sage()`.  There should be no problem with newer PARI versions, since I adapted `gcmp_try()` from `gequal_try()` in a recent development version.

Why do you make `<=` and `>=` return `True` for equal objects?  To me it doesn't make a lot of sense.  I can see that you might want that `a == b` implies `a <= b`, but in my opinion asking whether `a <= b` only makes sense if `a` and `b` are in some partially ordered set (like the real numbers with plus and minus infinity).

Neither PARI nor Sage returns true for `[0] <= 0` (while they disagree on `[0] == 0`):

```
gp > [0] <= 0
  ***   at top-level: [0]<=0
  ***                    ^---
  *** _<=_: forbidden comparison t_VEC (1 elts) , t_INT.
gp > [0] == 0
%1 = 1
```

```
sage: [0] <= 0
False
sage: [0] == 0
False
```
Note also the following from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names): "There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of `x==y` does not imply that `x!=y` is false."  Likewise, I don't think we should insist that the truth of `x==y` implies that of `x<=y`.

In that case, we should give an exception when asking for `a <= b`. I think returning False is more wrong than returning True when the objects are equal.

Sure, there is no implication, but I find it strange to have 2 objects such that `x == y` is True but `x <= y` is False.

OK, I think raising an error is conceptually and technically the right solution.  Earlier I wrongly convinced myself that comparison operators should never fail, but since they can, it makes sense to keep the behaviour of `gen` objects under comparison as close as possible to what PARI does, if only for efficiency reasons.

It turns out that there are only a few places where Sage tries to sort unordered PARI objects (polynomials, in fact).  We can basically use `list.sort(cmp=cmp)` to force the use of `__cmp__()` instead of the rich comparison operators.  In two cases (`enumerate_totallyreal_fields_*`) it is a bit more tricky, but after the necessary modifications the code actually becomes cleaner in my opinion (and not measurably slower).

Now testing if this approach works, and if it keeps working after experimentally replacing string comparison by PARI's `cmp_universal()`.

I find this a strange choice, but I guess we'll have to live with it...
> It seems the Python 3 way is to define either a sorting key (which isn't applicable here) or just use the rich comparison operators.

There are various solutions:
1. Python (3, at least) has a function `cmp_to_key` that converts a `cmp` function into a `key` function, so instead of `cmp=cmpfunc` you can specify `key=cmp_to_key(cmpfunc)`.  (The key returned by `cmp_to_key(cmpfunc)` for a given object `obj` is a new object wrapping `obj` with comparison operators implemented using `cmpfunc`.)  This looks artificial and inefficient.
2. When sorting polynomials (which are the only kind of non-ordered PARI objects that is currently sorted somewhere in the Sage library), one can specify `key=lambda f: f.list()`.
3. Any list of PARI objects can be sorted by converting it into a `t_VEC` and using one of several built-in PARI sorting functions.
I don't think the disappearance of the `cmp` keyword for sorting is serious enough that it forces us to keep `__cmp__()` and `__richcmp__()` consistent.  (In principle, if we adopt 2. or 3. above, we could even think about removing `gen._cmp_c_impl()`, so the generic `Element` code automatically falls back to using rich comparison to implement `__cmp__()`.

Agreed with your last comment.

In the code for totally real fields, I wonder whether it is really needed to sort on "polynomials". Sorting by discriminant seems sensible (and that's also what is documented), but since there is no meaningful comparison for polynomials, why bother in the first place? So my proposal would be to replace

```
S.sort(cmp=lambda x, y: cmp(x[0], y[0]) or cmp(x[1], y[1]))
```
by

```
S.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
```

Well, I just tried to change the existing code (which does the sorting in this way) as little as possible.  Also, after #17026 (and to a certain extent already when using string comparison), comparison of polynomials isn't totally meaningless either: they are first sorted by degree and then lexicographically.
