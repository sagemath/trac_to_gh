```
Comparison of PARI rationals is seriously broken:

```
sage: pari(1/2) < pari(1/3)
True
sage: pari(1) < pari(1/2)
True
```
Furthermore,the following PARI series and *p*-adics are incorrectly considered to be non-zero by `==` and `!=`:

```
sage: a = pari('O(x)'); a, a.type()
(O(x), 't_SER')
sage: b = pari('O(2)'); b, b.type()
(O(2), 't_PADIC')
sage: a.gequal(0)
True
sage: b.gequal(0)
True
sage: a == 0
False  # should be True
sage: b == 0
False  # should be True
```
These bugs are caused by `__cmp__()` calling the function `gcmp_sage()` in `sage/libs/pari/misc.h` (custom replacement for PARI's `gcmp()`), which uses string comparison for all types other than `t_INT` and `t_REAL`.

A possible solution is to implement `gen._richcmp_c_impl()` and to fix `gen._cmp_c_impl()` to use the standard PARI `gcmp()` instead of `gcmp_sage()`.  This requires catching PARI "forbidden comparison" errors.  There is actually a non-negligible speed-up if no such error occurs, but a substantial penalty if an error does occur.

Is it really *raising* the exception or it is *handling* the exception which takes a long time? If it's the second case, we might try some Cython machinery to speed up handling the exception.

I ended up practically copying the existing (static) `gen2.c:gequal_try()` and calling it `gcmp_try()`.  PARI already has another (somewhat different) universal comparison function `cmp_universal()`; I don't think the PARI library currently has a use for this `gcmp_try()`.

New branch coming soon, but here are the new timings (same notation as in [comment:5](#comment%3A5)), which leave nothing more to wish for in my opinion:

Why do you make `<=` and `>=` return `True` for equal objects?  To me it doesn't make a lot of sense.  I can see that you might want that `a == b` implies `a <= b`, but in my opinion asking whether `a <= b` only makes sense if `a` and `b` are in some partially ordered set (like the real numbers with plus and minus infinity).

Neither PARI nor Sage returns true for `[0] <= 0` (while they disagree on `[0] == 0`):

```
gp > [0] <= 0
  ***   at top-level: [0]<=0
  ***                    ^---
  *** _<=_: forbidden comparison t_VEC (1 elts) , t_INT.
gp > [0] == 0
%1 = 1
```

```
sage: [0] <= 0
False
sage: [0] == 0
False
```
Note also the following from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names): "There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of `x==y` does not imply that `x!=y` is false."  Likewise, I don't think we should insist that the truth of `x==y` implies that of `x<=y`.

In that case, we should give an exception when asking for `a <= b`. I think returning False is more wrong than returning True when the objects are equal.

> Note also the following from the ​Python documentation: "There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false." Likewise, I don't think we should insist that the truth of x==y implies that of x<=y.

Sure, there is no implication, but I find it strange to have 2 objects such that `x == y` is True but `x <= y` is False.

It turns out that there are only a few places where Sage tries to sort unordered PARI objects (polynomials, in fact).  We can basically use `list.sort(cmp=cmp)` to force the use of `__cmp__()` instead of the rich comparison operators.  In two cases (`enumerate_totallyreal_fields_*`) it is a bit more tricky, but after the necessary modifications the code actually becomes cleaner in my opinion (and not measurably slower).

Now testing if this approach works, and if it keeps working after experimentally replacing string comparison by PARI's `cmp_universal()`.
