<a id='comment:14'></a>It looks good about the `_call_` problem but there is some others...

```
sage: PF4 = ParkingFunctions(4)
sage: sage: a = PF4.list()[36]
sage: sage: b = PF4([1,3,2,1])
sage: a.parent()
Traceback (most recent call last):

sage: a

sage: b.parent()

It seems (to me) to be easily "rewritable" with that ticket #16465. (It could be a test of that design...).

<a id='comment:16'></a>If you want. That is true that if this ticket depends of #16465 it will be accepted only in few months (or y.. except if someone better than me in english accept to improve(/do) the documentation and check the code).

Before close the ticket, I want try to append a `Parent`class to ParkingFunctions... (an ugly patch will be proposed this evening).
