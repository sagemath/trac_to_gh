sage: PF4 = ParkingFunctions(4)
sage: a = PF4.list()[36]
sage: b = PF4([1,3,2,1])
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.combinat.parking_functions.ParkingFunction_class'>
sage: type(b)
<class 'sage.combinat.combinat.CombinatorialObject'>
```

Add a `__call__` method to create ParkingFunction_class objects.

Add lexigographic comparaison tests for ParkingFunction_class.

It looks good about the `_call_` problem but there is some others...

```
sage: PF4 = ParkingFunctions(4)
sage: sage: a = PF4.list()[36]
sage: sage: b = PF4([1,3,2,1])
sage: a.parent()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'ParkingFunction_class' object has no attribute 'parent'
sage: a
[1, 4, 2, 1]
sage: b.parent()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'ParkingFunction_class' object has no attribute 'parent'
```

It seems (to me) to be easily "rewritable" with that ticket #16465. (It could be a test of that design...).

I added the Element framework to the ParkingFunctions_n class.

I also corrected some lines with >79 charaters in the documention.

I am still not convinced that it is the right place to do so. Indeed, even if this is a painless improvement, the entire code need to be redo at some point. For example, it would be a good idea to give a structure of monoid, and to integrate the ParkingFunction_class inside the ElementMethods of ParkingFunctions_all. We coule also see the ParkingFunctions_all as a graded set on ParkingFunctions_n and I am not sure about what to do for getting all of this.

Anyway, I still think that it deserves a new ticket.
