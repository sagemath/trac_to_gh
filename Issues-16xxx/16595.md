<a id='comment:21'></a>I added the Element framework to the ParkingFunctions_n class.

I also corrected some lines with >79 charaters in the documention.

I am still not convinced that it is the right place to do so. Indeed, even if this is a painless improvement, the entire code need to be redo at some point. For example, it would be a good idea to give a structure of monoid, and to integrate the ParkingFunction_class inside the ElementMethods of ParkingFunctions_all. We coule also see the ParkingFunctions_all as a graded set on ParkingFunctions_n and I am not sure about what to do for getting all of this.

Anyway, I still think that it deserves a new ticket.
