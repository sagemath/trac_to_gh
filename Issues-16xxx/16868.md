Change Sage's standard to be coherent with OA which have k columns. This is much easier to work with on a computer, for it is much easier to add a row to a matrix than to add a column. And this is what we have to do most of the time.

Well, first if you only have one "zip*" in the whole library then the point is reached. I looked at that part of the code and I felt that the best way to implement it required two calls to zip, but for all others applications (functions in `database.py`) it is easier to work on this version of the matrix, for one constantly add rows, not columns.

So even if there is a "zip*" somewhere, the rest of the code is easier to write/read.
