And wrong ones, of course.  See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/TRM4f-LJ6vE).

```
sage: disc1= region_plot(lambda x, y : x^2+y^2 < 1, (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1))
sage: disc2= region_plot(lambda x, y : (x-0.7)^2+(y-0.7)^2 < 0.5, (x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2) )
```
then do `disc1+disc2` and `disc2+disc1` for some surprises.  Most likely we are abusing `contourf` in matplotlib a little by allowing the adding of these plots.

> Interesting fix!  Do you think the change in the "endpoints" for the contours will make a big difference?  Thanks for the contribution, I'll put this on my list for things to review once the semester is over.

Do you mean the change of `contours` from `[-1e307, 0, 1e307]` to `[-1e-20, 0, 1e-20]`?
 
Yes, I think setting `contours=[-1e307, 0, 1e307]` was not a good idea. I tried 

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: region_plot(x^2+y^2 < 1, (x, -1, 1), (y, -1, 1), incol='blue', outcol='red',alpha=0.5)
``` 
with setting `contours=[-0.2, 0, 0.2]`, and figured out that the meaning of the "endpoints" was quite different from what I had imagined.
