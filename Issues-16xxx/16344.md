One can currently not compute the virtual rays of fans in non-saturated lattices:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(1) 
sage: B = N.submodule([(2,)]).basis()
sage: f = Fan([Cone([B[0]])])
sage: f.virtual_rays()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ArithmeticError: cannot interpret [(1)] as a sublattice of Sublattice <N(2)>!
```

Lastly, why should one even worry about this? Since `ToricDivisorGroup` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation`, it compares fans of newly created toric varieties with all fans in the cache. If one therefore has one malfunctioning fans, creating divisors in 'good' toric varieties will fail, too:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(2) 
sage: B = N.submodule([(2,1), (1,2)]).basis()
sage: f = Fan([Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])])
sage: X = ToricVariety(f)
sage: aK = -X.K()

sage: B = N.submodule([(1,0), (1,1)]).basis()
sage: B[0].parent() is B[0].parent().saturation()
True
sage: f2 = Fan([Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])])
sage: X2 = ToricVariety(f2)
sage: from sage.schemes.toric.divisor import ToricDivisorGroup
sage: aK2 = -X2.K()
ArithmeticError: cannot interpret [(1, 2), (-1, -3)] as a sublattice of Sublattice <N(1, 2), N(0, 3)>!
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi Andrey,

thanks again for taking a look. Well, fixing virtual rays would of course be better.  The line throwing an exception is

```
quotient = N.quotient(self.rays().matrix().saturation().rows())
```
since there may be rows that aren't elements of N. A (dirty) possible solution that comes to mind is to instead take to quotient of the ambient module of N wrt to these elements and then take the submodule of that quotient lattice, i.e. something like this:

```
qp = N.ambient_module().quotient(self.rays().matrix().saturation().rows())
quotient = qp.submodule(N.gens())
```
I'm afraid that that's probably something too naive/stupid and I'd be happy to hear why. :)

Best,
Jan
