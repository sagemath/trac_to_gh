Forget the last part of my previous comment:  I had already done the merge, as you can see from the list of new commits (first the merge, then my reviewer's patch).  So this is ready for re-review by the original author!

I have now made #16743 dependent on this (isogeny classes of elliptic curves over number fields), which means that I am keener than ever to get this merged.

A few comments:
* The docstring of the main function reads ""Returns a list of primes `p` including all primes for which the mod-`p` representation might not be contained in a Borel."" Isn't it the complement, i.e., all those that "may be contained in a Borel" ?

* I thought  "try: ...  except `ValueError`: return [0]"  is not what we should do. If the long and convoluted line in try produces a `ValueError`, that could have many reasons, and we should not just ignore this and send back [0] but pass the error on.

* It is a shame that this function will not be available for curves over Q. But I guess it should be a separate ticket to merge the two classes dealing with Galois Reps together at some point.

You are right.

> * I thought  "try: ...  except `ValueError`: return [0]"  is not what we should do. If the long and convoluted line in try produces a `ValueError`, that could have many reasons, and we should not just ignore this and send back [0] but pass the error on.

Agreed.  I said so myself somewhere.

I will revise the branch to take into account your first two points...
