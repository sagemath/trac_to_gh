```
sage: X=CombinatorialFreeModule(RDF,ZZ,category=ModulesWithBasis(RDF))
sage: Y=cartesian_product((X,X))
sage: X in ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
True
sage: Y in ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
False
sage: Y.categories()[1]
Category of modules with basis over Real Double Field
sage: Y.categories()[1] is ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
False
```

This weirdness relates to the fact that `ModulesWithBasis(RDF)` prints as the `Category of vector spaces with basis over Real Double Field`. The `Category of modules with basis over Real Double Field` is one of its super categories.

In the case at hand I cannot construct a morphism from `Y` to `X` because of the category mismatch:

```
sage: Y.module_morphism(codomain=X,on_basis=lambda (i,j):X.monomial(i))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
..
ValueError: Free module generated by Integer Ring over Real Double Field (+) Free module generated by Integer Ring over Real Double Field is not in Category of vector spaces with basis over Real Double Field
```

I've also had to change half a dozen unrelated files that had doctests to make sure that vector spaces had neither tensor product nor cartesian products. 

The idea to document a snapshot of the current category graph in doctests that are spread out all over the place is not very good: it makes fixing things painful, and it doesn't prevent serious bugs [as this and other category related tickets show].

LGTM. Although I've made a few trivial line break changes.

BTW, we all want our bugs (and tickets) addressed/reviewed quickly. As a courtesy, please don't set things to blocker trying to get yours looked at. Instead you can cc me (or other who might be good for reviewing it) and I'll look at it as soon as I can.
