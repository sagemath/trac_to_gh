```
sage: X=CombinatorialFreeModule(RDF,ZZ,category=ModulesWithBasis(RDF))
sage: Y=cartesian_product((X,X))
sage: X in ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
True
sage: Y in ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
False
sage: Y.categories()[1]
Category of modules with basis over Real Double Field
sage: Y.categories()[1] is ModulesWithBasis(RDF)
False
```

This weirdness relates to the fact that `ModulesWithBasis(RDF)` prints as the `Category of vector spaces with basis over Real Double Field`. The `Category of modules with basis over Real Double Field` is one of its super categories.

In the case at hand I cannot construct a morphism from `Y` to `X` because of the category mismatch:

```
sage: Y.module_morphism(codomain=X,on_basis=lambda (i,j):X.monomial(i))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
..
ValueError: Free module generated by Integer Ring over Real Double Field (+) Free module generated by Integer Ring over Real Double Field is not in Category of vector spaces with basis over Real Double Field
```

I've also had to change half a dozen unrelated files that had doctests to make sure that vector spaces had neither tensor product nor cartesian products. 

The idea to document a snapshot of the current category graph in doctests that are spread out all over the place is not very good: it makes fixing things painful, and it doesn't prevent serious bugs [as this and other category related tickets show].
