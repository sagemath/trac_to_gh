It is not. If you fetch public/16356 the last commit is 7475474b531df3ef96d218e93045d24d254cff3c being different from the one here. So the rebase just worked.

....

If you rebase this commit, then all patches above have to be updated.

And basically all design branches in `needs_review` are above this one at the moment.

Anyway there is no need to merge this branch with the updated #16295, because there are no merge conflicts. And the tests pass.
