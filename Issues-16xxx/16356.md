Why on earth would you rebase the whole branch ? It will make all commits incompatible !

....

If you rebase this commit, then all patches above have to be updated.

And basically all design branches in `needs_review` are above this one at the moment.

Anyway there is no need to merge this branch with the updated #16295, because there are no merge conflicts. And the tests pass.
