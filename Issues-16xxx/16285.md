Just noticed this on [6.2.rc1](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/releases/tag/6.2.rc1):

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/partitions.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/partitions.pyx", line 71, in sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions
Failed example:
    number_of_partitions( n - (n % 385) + 369) % 385 == 0  # long time (4s on sage.math, 2011)
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  26 in sage.combinat.partitions.number_of_partitions
    [35 tests, 1 failure, 5.88 s]
```

Not sure when this got introduced. Will dig deeper if you have trouble reproducing this.
