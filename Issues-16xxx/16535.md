1) Moving the three Wilson constructions (product, one truncated group and two truncated groups) from `orthogonal_arrays.py` to `orthogonal_arrays_recursive.py` will improve readability.

2) There is no need of the `who_asked` parameter in the functions `orthogonal_array`, `mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares` and `transversal_design` since all recursive functions belong to the `orthogonal_array`.

3) As remarked in #16503, avoid calling recursive construction for `OA(3,n)`.

Depends on #16528

What if you learnt that that patch was written before the one which deprecated this function ?

> The chronological order doesn't really matter.

Your previous comment was the following

> If you deprecate something then you should have the foresight to not use it in your current development.

I explained to you why it was groundless.

We just try to add code to Sage, and we try to ensure it passes tests at all times, and the doc, but there is a lot of commits involved and building the pdf doc, for instance, is not instantaneous. I also wanted to tell you how closing tickets without making a release after can complicate our work, and so I did.

Understand what you will.
