The target of this ticket is to provide/add a function is_weak_popov to the matrix interface. The function should return true if the matrix it is called on is in weak popov form. This ticket is independent from but connected to #16742.

Short description of weak popov form: Let R be an ordered Ring and A<sup>mxn</sup> a matrix over R. The leading position of a row is called the position i  in [1,m) such that the order of A[i,_] is maximal within the row. If  there are multiple entries with the maximum order, the highest i is the  leading position (the furthest to the right in the matrix). A is in weak  popov form if all leading positions are different (zero lines ignored).

The function will implement this only for polynomial rings, the order function is the degree of the polynomial. Example:

[x<sup>2</sup>+1, x]

[x, x+1]

is in weak popov form: Row 1 has the degrees 2 and 1, the leading position is for i=0, row 2 has two times degree 1 so the higher i is chosen with i=1.

[x<sup>2</sup>+1, x]

[x,0]

is NOT in weak popov form, row 1 has now degrees 1 and -1, so the leading position is i=0 as in row 1.

<div id="comment:13" align="right">comment:13</div>

Though the check is elegantly written in two lines, I think it has two
unnecessary downsides:

- It allocates a new matrix in the apply_map, instead of calculating
  the degrees on inspection.

- It doesn't fail fast: for instance, if the first two rows have the
  same leading position, we don't need to continue.

Both issues can be repaired by changing the outer list comprehension
into a loop, where one maintains an auxiliary set of already seen
leading positions.

Probably is_weak_popov will usually not be a performance bottleneck, but nonetheless.

Cheers,
jsrn

Btw. Sage usually has line wraps on doc strings, right? The line under OUTPUT is very long. Also, the last sentence there is missing a full stop.

Last pet peeve: can you change one or two of the doc tests to be
non-square matrices?

Come to think of it, if the matrix has more rows than cols, the function can immediately return False.
