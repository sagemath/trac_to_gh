Okay, here we can just do all fixes for any remaining libraries which for [whatever](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16017#comment:39) [reason](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16017#comment:42) don't have the right [install_name](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/q1DPhL8WQiM/tXZs-byQBRUJ).

R will be needed for rpy to build.

Pari became #17588 and in any case wasn't *necessary* for building.

Just wonder what changed overall in Sage that makes these changes necessary now.

`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` not set when it was previously?  Should we perhaps set `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`?   (Not sure whether the latter applies to MacOS X 10.4 at all.)

And whenever the Sage installation moves, we'll have to update all those paths / `install_name`s, too.

Well, we used to have odd scripts like `sage-make_relative`, called after any package installation, unconditionally retrying to rewrite everything... :-)

(Not to mention completely uselessly rerunning `ranlib` on all static libraries each time Sage thought its location might have changed...)

So you're saying that any solution that fixes this is brittle?  Sage should be relocatable, at least that is the usual expectation (and is why the `sage-location` script is/was always run, though with the reorganized structure I'm still getting used to a few changes that may have happened recently.)

For the record, that bu!**sh!** is still in Sage 6.2.beta6's `sage-location`:

```python

def update_library_files():
    """
    Run ``ranlib`` on all static libraries (``*.a``) in the library
    directory, and manually change the paths in all ``.la`` libtool
    archives.
    """
    for libdir in ["lib", "lib32", "lib64"]:
        LIB = os.path.join(SAGE_LOCAL, libdir)
        if not os.path.isdir(LIB):
            continue

        # The .a files should be re-ranlib'd:
        os.system('cd "%s"; ranlib *.a 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null' % LIB)

        ...

```

I think that having a non-movable OS X 10.4 is probably ok, since it's such an unusual platform nowadays.  I largely want to keep it going now because it has a chip that is not Intel nor ARM.

`man dyld` definitely gives `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` under synopsis.  "By default set to `$(HOME)/lib:/usr/local/lib:/lib:/usr/lib`."  And apparently that is honored by `ld`.  The only useful info in `man install_name_tool` is that if you want to change the names to long ones is that you want to pass the `-header-pad_max_install_names` option to `ld`.

`@`rpath is OS X 10.5+ but `@`loader_path and `@`execute_path are in 10.4. As it happens we wouldn't want `@`rpath I think. `@`loader_path is apparently filling the same role as "Origin" under linux. And `@`loader_path is what is in polybori. I just don't know if it is correct in there.

Looks as if relocation was currently broken on **any** Darwin (at least MacOS X 10.6, too) anyway.  Not going to tell you what happened when trying `make [p]testlong` in the renamed beta5 installation...

I think that's good news.  We could prepend `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` (and probably some R subdirs) to that.

:-)  Depends on what weird paths users decide to install / move Sage into.

FWIW, `chrpath` (for ELF objects) also needs (or used to need) some "workspace".

Again, my concern here is especially that when people download binaries that they work, since those are technically relocated (by actual miles, not just bits).

It was some beta for 6.2, I think 6.2.beta3. I have since deleted it. To be clear:

- I moved it and ran `make ptestlong`. I got the above failures.

You have to change this to an absolute path ($SAGE_LOCAL/lib/R/lib/...), 
with 'install_name_tool -id ...'. 

Presumably the same for libRlapack.dylib, probably libR.dylib as well.

Hmmm, there are at least two (temporary?) solutions, modifying R's `spkg-install`:

* Patch R's `configure[.ac]`.

* Fix R's libraries (on Darwin) with `install_name_tool` afterwards.

On the other hand, it isn't horrible - `rpy2` is virtually not needed at all for Sage, I'm still not sure why we included it.  Sage itself works fine, and so does at least the basic R.

```
> 2+2 
[1] 4
> a <- c(1,2,3)
> a
[1] 1 2 3
```


The best I could do in compiling was

```
$ LDFLAGS="-Wl,$(SAGE_LOCAL)/lib/R/lib/" make
```

which however ran into this problem again, I guess.
