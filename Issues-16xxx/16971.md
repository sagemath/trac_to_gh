In the sage notebook (from Sage 6.2) I can write the following things without seeing an exception:

```
1 = 2
foo = 1 = 2
```

On the command line, these correctly complain:

```
sage: 1 = 2
ValueError: The name "1" is not a valid Python identifier.
sage: foo = 1 = 2
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
```

But in the notebook, these apparently get executed, since at the end the variable `foo` has the value `2`. So it seems that the notebook does more than `preparse` indicates. I see no modification of global literals, but even so silently ignoring such errors seems like pretty bad style. Particular since proffesional mathematicians but novice programmers might tend to place `=` signs in places we don't expect them to.

Keywords: **assignment silent syntax preparse**
