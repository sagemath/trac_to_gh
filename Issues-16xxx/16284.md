I tried this, but it also failed.
The problematic line in `src/sage/schemes/toric/divisor.py` is

```
SimplicialComplex([c.ambient_ray_indices() for c in negative_cones])
```
The passed list previously became `vertex_set` and now it becomes `maximal_faces`.

So maybe we should do

```diff

          C = None

              maximal_faces = []

The deprecation warning was only raised if `vertex_set` and `maximal_faces` were defined, which was not the case in
`SimplicialComplex([c.ambient_ray_indices() for c in negative_cones])`.

Adding `maximal_faces=` won't change anything because it's (beside `**kwds`) the only remaining parameter passed to `__init__()` after applying this patch.
