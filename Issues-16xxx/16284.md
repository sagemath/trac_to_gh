I tried this, but it also failed.
The problematic line in `src/sage/schemes/toric/divisor.py` is

```
SimplicialComplex([c.ambient_ray_indices() for c in negative_cones])
```
The passed list previously became `vertex_set` and now it becomes `maximal_faces`.

So maybe we should do

```diff
--- a/src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
+++ b/src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
@@ -816,21 +798,9 @@
          C = None
+         vertex_set = maximal_faces
          if maximal_faces is None:
              vertex_set = []
              maximal_faces = []
```

What do you think?

The deprecation warning was only raised if `vertex_set` and `maximal_faces` were defined, which was not the case in
`SimplicialComplex([c.ambient_ray_indices() for c in negative_cones])`.

Adding `maximal_faces=` won't change anything because it's (beside `**kwds`) the only remaining parameter passed to `__init__()` after applying this patch.
