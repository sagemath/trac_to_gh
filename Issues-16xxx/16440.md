Well, the whole idea of *importing* (=running) code just to build its documentation is a very bad idea anyway (though of course "powerful"), but that's a different story...

I'll give it a try, but I can't imagine I'm actually running out of (virtual) memory in my docbuild-broken upgraded installation.

At least it fixed the issue for me...  (I didn't recall I had `gap_packages` installed into the installation.)

(Although probably it was really the Maxima upgrade to 5.33 which fixed it, or one of the other 50 tickets that got pulled in by pulling the branch here... ;-) )

I am running tests with `--optional=sage,database_gap,gap_packages`, and seeing few errors. E.g.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py", line 372, in sage.combinat.sloane_functions.A000001._eval
Failed example:
    sloane.A000001._eval(51) # optional - database_gap
Expected nothing
Got:
    1
**********************************************************************
```
There are also errors in `src/sage/coding/linear_code.py` related to `guava`.
Are they for a separate ticket?
