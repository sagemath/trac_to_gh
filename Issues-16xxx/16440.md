I am running tests with `--optional=sage,database_gap,gap_packages`, and seeing few errors. E.g.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/combinat/sloane_functions.py", line 372, in sage.combinat.sloane_functions.A000001._eval
Failed example:
    sloane.A000001._eval(51) # optional - database_gap
Expected nothing
Got:
    1
**********************************************************************
```
There are also errors in `src/sage/coding/linear_code.py` related to `guava`.
Are they for a separate ticket?
