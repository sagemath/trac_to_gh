# Issue 16640: Graphics3d.show abuses graphics_filename

Note that only the last two commits are new for this ticket; the rest comes from #16645 and its dependencies.

I tested things both in notebook and interactively. java3d failed in both cases, for which I just filed #16647. Apart from that, everything looks fine. In particular it seems as if I got all the file name interdependencies for jmol right.

My main reason for modifying that line at all was the fact that canvas3d only works in embedded mode, so having it available otherwise might confuse users. My reson for including it in doctests is simply because all the other possible viewers are active in doctest mode as well. There is a doctest specifically for the canvas3d case, but if I restrict canvas3d to embedded mode only, that one would fail. So staying in line with all the other tests seemed the reasonable thing to do.

If things really are too slow, I'd change that to
`if viewer == 'canvas3d' and (DOCTEST_MODE or EMBEDDED_MODE):`
so we can have that one explicit doctest nevertheless. But first I'd like to quantify that effect on test execution time, and right now I have a build problem.

Here is something minor but still needing attention. The documentation says

```
        -  ``filename`` -- string (default: a temp file); file
           to save the image to
```
but of course this is now only going to be true in the command line.  Which probably makes sense.  But this should be noted.  Similarly,

```
        # Tachyon resolution options
```
should probably just add a quick note that "mode defaults" also are being set in the next few lines.

Interestingly,

```
            # Temporary hack: encode the desired applet size in the end of the filename:
            # (This will be removed once we have dynamic resizing of applets in the browser.)
```
and the following code could in principle be removed, as the update does indeed have dynamic resizing!  But I think let's leave that be for somewhere else; I don't want to mess with the already messy naming of jmol stuff...

Finally, I don't understand this comment - I'm sorry if I am just thinking inside the box:

```
                # when testing this, modify graphics_filename so that it
                # returns files which don't automatically share a base name,
                # e.g.: "import random; i = random.randint(0, 10000)"
```
Was this just a "note to self" or do you mean that, as a tester, I should actually change `graphics_filename` instead of letting it just keep adding one to base names, or ... ?  I figured the whole point of this change was to test where they *did* share a base name, but again I may be thinking too conventionally.

The following in the *command line* don't seem to create any files (I mean visible ones in my directory).  Maybe they aren't supposed to?

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: plot3d(x^2+y^3,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),filename='foo')
sage: plot3d(x^2+y^3,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),filename='foo',viewer='tachyon')
```
Note that the second thing pops up a jmol viewer.  I can't figure out if this ticket introduced it, though it seems to predate that, based on my experimentation.

Also, with the current documentation, there is no example of how to *properly* use the `filename` keyword here, and that should be added.

Anyway, "needs work" to clarify/fix these `filename` use issues.

Good to know.  But that sort of proves my point, then, that the documentation (old and new) doesn't tell me that - in this case, because so  many keywords can be passed to the plot and then show up in `show()`.  Such as what worked in Sage 6.2 and possibly broken by the new display hook

```
sage: var('y')
y
sage: plot3d(x^2+y^3,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),viewer='jmol')  # jmol applet pops up
sage: plot3d(x^2+y^3,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),viewer='tachyon') # tachyon-generated png pops up in a viewer
```
If you confirm that this does work properly to generate the filenames in the command line then I'm okay with making sure there are explicit examples that say it doesn't work from the plot command - preferably in the plot command docs!

Hmm, I guess.  But I don't know that there is any easy way to find files in a cell directory in the notebook - though I guess a good use case is to save it in the `DATA` directory, where it of course shouldn't show up in the cell output.

In vanilla (i.e. without this patch) sage-6.4.rc0 in the notebook, when doing

```
cube(viewer="jmol")

And I am happy with everything except I need to look at the very last patch one more time... okay, looks good other than two questions.

Question - is this a Python syntax I'm not aware of?

```
def show(self, *, filename=None, **kwds):
```
In particular, the extra `*` mystifies me.  (Edit - okay, I found it, but it appears to be Python 3 only?  I believe it works in recent Python 2.x since you used it, but I couldn't find a definitive reference - even the Python reference was ambiguous.)

Oh, and maybe add a doctest for [this commit](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=3852a0a23966400e02a14512e97e8ae46e45ec2a&id=bd1479d38fe1adb42755ab92499ff8c1ba35592d) with the error raised?  Maybe that's too trivial to do... but for some reason the doctest

```
sage: p.show(viewer='canvas3d')
```
doesn't raise an error, which makes sense because of the code.  But it *also* is now doctested with the [most recent change](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/bd1479d38fe1adb42755ab92499ff8c1ba35592d) you made, despite what you just said earlier that making canvas3d guys was too long!

Aha.

And it really does save to where needed, awesome!  Especially in `DATA` could be useful.

> despite what you just said earlier that making canvas3d guys was too long! 

Okay, sorry, I see what you did now - got a little too excited there.  What do you think about testing the warning?

Otherwise this was good teamwork by you two, very nice.

That's possible but requires some messing around with `DOCTEST_MODE`. Given that it's a minor thing and that Volker has plans to change all this code anyway, I feel that it's not worth the trouble. But if you insist, I will add that test.
