In this ticket we reimplement all of matrix_integer_dense using FLINT fmpz_mat_t.

The speed-up is substantial. With the new code:

```
sage: A = Matrix(ZZ,1000,1000,range(10^6))
sage: %time B = A*A
CPU times: user 883 ms, sys: 3.33 ms, total: 887 ms
Wall time: 888 ms
```

This takes more than 1 minute in the same computer using Sage 6.3.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi,

A first remark playing around with timings is that in sage-6.3 somebody or something has definitely *completely massively screwed* up Linbox, or how Linbox is built, or how we use linbox, which was the default representation and library for arithmetic. Consider this:

```
sage: n=200; set_random_seed(0); a = random_matrix(ZZ,n); b = random_matrix(ZZ,n)
sage: %time c=a._multiply_linbox(b)
CPU times: user 326 ms, sys: 3.63 ms, total: 330 ms
Wall time: 347 ms
sage: %time c=a._multiply_multi_modular(b)
CPU times: user 51.5 ms, sys: 1.6 ms, total: 53.1 ms
Wall time: 56.1 ms
sage: n=400; set_random_seed(0); a = random_matrix(ZZ,n); b = random_matrix(ZZ,n)
sage: %time c=a._multiply_linbox(b)
CPU times: user 5.28 s, sys: 22.8 ms, total: 5.3 s
Wall time: 5.37 s
sage: %time c=a._multiply_multi_modular(b)
CPU times: user 230 ms, sys: 6.08 ms, total: 236 ms
Wall time: 248 ms
```

Linbox should easily beat the multiply_multi_modular approach -- that's just basically a naive version of the same thing linbox would be doing if it were properly built and linked.  Instead, Linbox is massively slower.   In fact, almost exactly as much slower as I would expect if the wrong BLAS were being linked.    Note that I tested against the new flint backend and now a._multiply_multi_modular(b) is asymptotically similar to flint, though asymptotically (for n=2000 already), they are pretty close to the same in speed (8.55s versus 11.4s).      In any case, somebody should really look into why linbox is so screwed up -- we switched to it initially since it was much better than doing a._multiply_multi_modular(b) and also our own strassen implementation.

The following three methods are now still gone.  Add them back so I can run some randomized consistency tests more easily...

```
     a._multiply_classical      a._multiply_linbox         a._multiply_multi_modular

When these are added back, and I run tests of correctness by comparing with them, then I'll give this an enthusiastic positive review.

<a id='comment:16'></a>MAJOR PROBLEM!  Now that multiply_multi_modular is back, I wrote code to do some random testing of correctness.  I did not find situations where things are wrong... however, I quickly ran into major trouble because this ticket introduces a huge memory leak.    I just defined two matrices and multiplied them a few hundred times, and had major ram problems.  In particular, in sage-6.3 (without this branch):

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
1047.1875
sage: for i in range(50):
....:         a=random_matrix(ZZ,300); del a
....: 
sage: get_memory_usage()
1047.1875
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
2132.09765625
sage: for i in range(50):
    a=random_matrix(ZZ,300); del a
....: 
sage: get_memory_usage()
2231.3203125
```

**Conclusion: making nontrivial use of the code on this ticket will very quickly use up all RAM on your computer.**

So... needs work until that is fixed.

Are you sure this isn't an imaginary slow-down?  Just for fun, I installed some old versions of Sage on boxen and executed the command

```
$ time ./sage -c '_ = Matrix(ZZ,1000,1000,range(10^6))^5'

I tested Sage versions 2.9(*), 2.11(*), 3.0.6, 3.2.3, 4.1, 4.5, 4.7, 5.0, 5.12, 6.1.1, 6.3 and the above command always took about 12 minutes. Note that boxen is not an idle machine, so it's difficult to get accurate timings, but there is certainly no massive slow-down.

(*) For these versions, ATLAS didn't compile so I used the ATLAS package from Sage 3.0.6.

One has to balance that with the fact that for whatever reason, without this ticket a vast range of linear algebra in Sage is so utterly orders of magnitude too slow, as to make it painful and useless for research work.    This new code is **dramatically** faster than before.

When looking at this code, there are some sloppy things (like why is the `_det_pari()` function duplicated?). Overall, I have less faith in sloppy code than clear code.

That's not the problem. In general, I think it's good to rely on external packages if they do a good job (which seems to be the case here).

[comment:82] was made out of frustration by seeing so many things here which are dubious. So okay, that's not constructive.

However in [comment:90], I noticed a mistake, mentioned it in the comment and fixed it in #17090. How is that not constructive?

That's true, but after William Stein's comment, I have fixed that back in #17090.

Please don't. I think it's absolutely good to improve matrices like you did here. The fact that I am making so many comments and creating follow-up tickets means that I care. I make mistakes, you make mistakes, that's normal and that's why have this review process.

My only complaint (and I still stand behind this) is that this ticket was given positive_review too soon. Ideally, those 3 follow-up tickets should have been reviewer patches on this ticket.

Well, you can look at the follow-up tickets #17090 and #17094 and see what I changed (and preferably review those tickets).

Some general things which haven't been mentioned yet:
1. clean-up your code when you change things: when you remove code, try to remove everything related to the old code. When you change code, the old structure might not be applicable anymore, so refactor if needed (e.g. the sepatate branch for `n <= 4` in `determinant()` no longer serves any purpose)
2. also fix documentation: when you change something, also change the corresponding documentation. When you copy/paste something, be sure to update documentation and doctests (see the various `set_unsafe` methods).
3. don't add unneeded import statements or includes, those add needless extra dependencies. Like, why did you add `include "sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi"` in several places when you don't use any NTL code?
4. try to use correct formatting: spacing, indentation, docstring formatting (this was mostly good, but a bit messed up in `src/module_list.py`). If anything, this makes your code look more professional and less sloppy.
5. don't use `assert` for checking user input: use `assert` for when you *know* that something is true (but want to check just in case), not when you need to check that something is true.

Thanks! These comments are helpful indeed.
