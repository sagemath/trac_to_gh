In this ticket we reimplement all of matrix_integer_dense using FLINT fmpz_mat_t.

The speed-up is substantial. With the new code:

```
sage: A = Matrix(ZZ,1000,1000,range(10^6))
sage: %time B = A*A
CPU times: user 883 ms, sys: 3.33 ms, total: 887 ms
Wall time: 888 ms
```

This takes more than 1 minute in the same computer using Sage 6.3.

A word of caution about algorithm defaults: FLINT should generally be faster for small input but IML/Linbox etc. probably have much better code for things like nullspace, charpoly... as soon as the matrices start to get large.

Replacing _rational_kernel_iml with _rational_kernel_flint, for example, is strange. Surely both algorithms should be available.

Hi,

A first remark playing around with timings is that in sage-6.3 somebody or something has definitely *completely massively screwed* up Linbox, or how Linbox is built, or how we use linbox, which was the default representation and library for arithmetic. Consider this:

```
sage: n=200; set_random_seed(0); a = random_matrix(ZZ,n); b = random_matrix(ZZ,n)
sage: %time c=a._multiply_linbox(b)
CPU times: user 326 ms, sys: 3.63 ms, total: 330 ms
Wall time: 347 ms
sage: %time c=a._multiply_multi_modular(b)
CPU times: user 51.5 ms, sys: 1.6 ms, total: 53.1 ms
Wall time: 56.1 ms
sage: n=400; set_random_seed(0); a = random_matrix(ZZ,n); b = random_matrix(ZZ,n)
sage: %time c=a._multiply_linbox(b)
CPU times: user 5.28 s, sys: 22.8 ms, total: 5.3 s
Wall time: 5.37 s
sage: %time c=a._multiply_multi_modular(b)
CPU times: user 230 ms, sys: 6.08 ms, total: 236 ms
Wall time: 248 ms
```

Linbox should easily beat the multiply_multi_modular approach -- that's just basically a naive version of the same thing linbox would be doing if it were properly built and linked.  Instead, Linbox is massively slower.   In fact, almost exactly as much slower as I would expect if the wrong BLAS were being linked.    Note that I tested against the new flint backend and now a._multiply_multi_modular(b) is asymptotically similar to flint, though asymptotically (for n=2000 already), they are pretty close to the same in speed (8.55s versus 11.4s).      In any case, somebody should really look into why linbox is so screwed up -- we switched to it initially since it was much better than doing a._multiply_multi_modular(b) and also our own strassen implementation.

OK, I've been skeptically looking at and testing this patch much of today.  I made a few  tiny changes, but frankly I think this is overall AWESOME.   FLINT's linear algebra seems quite good. 

The following three methods are now still gone.  Add them back so I can run some randomized consistency tests more easily...

```
     a._multiply_classical      a._multiply_linbox         a._multiply_multi_modular
```

When these are added back, and I run tests of correctness by comparing with them, then I'll give this an enthusiastic positive review.

MAJOR PROBLEM!  Now that multiply_multi_modular is back, I wrote code to do some random testing of correctness.  I did not find situations where things are wrong... however, I quickly ran into major trouble because this ticket introduces a huge memory leak.    I just defined two matrices and multiplied them a few hundred times, and had major ram problems.  In particular, in sage-6.3 (without this branch):

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
1047.1875
sage: for i in range(50):
....:         a=random_matrix(ZZ,300); del a
....: 
sage: get_memory_usage()
1047.1875
```

With this ticket:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
2132.09765625
sage: for i in range(50):
    a=random_matrix(ZZ,300); del a
....: 
sage: get_memory_usage()
2231.3203125
```

**Conclusion: making nontrivial use of the code on this ticket will very quickly use up all RAM on your computer.**

So... needs work until that is fixed.

Are you sure this isn't an imaginary slow-down?  Just for fun, I installed some old versions of Sage on boxen and executed the command

```
$ time ./sage -c '_ = Matrix(ZZ,1000,1000,range(10^6))^5'
```

I tested Sage versions 2.9(*), 2.11(*), 3.0.6, 3.2.3, 4.1, 4.5, 4.7, 5.0, 5.12, 6.1.1, 6.3 and the above command always took about 12 minutes. Note that boxen is not an idle machine, so it's difficult to get accurate timings, but there is certainly no massive slow-down.

(*) For these versions, ATLAS didn't compile so I used the ATLAS package from Sage 3.0.6.

Thanks for testing.   I wouldn't be at all surprised if the problem was introduced quite a long time ago -- I haven't benchmarked sage linear algebra at all since around the time when Clement was my postdoc (about 2007-2008), and at that time definitely a properly built linbox provided the fastest matrix multiply (and many other things).   It might still today -- I don't know.

I have fixed this by changing the code of sage.structure.element.Matrix.__div__, which was assuming that the _matrix_times_matrix method of matrix.matrix_integer_dense would know how to deal with matrices over the rationals. This is a low-level private function which doesn't do type checking, which I think is the right thing to do.

What the current patch does is, when writing something like A/B for matrices A and B, to take the denominator out of ~B, multiply and then put it back. I have run make ptest and all passed **except** for some that have nothing to do with matrices, for example this one:

Your last fix is almost certainly going to break over other rings. In any case, this change requires extra doctests over other rings.

I would advise the following: the matrix division coercion model bug is independent of this ticket. I recommend you to create a new ticket for that and make this ticket depend on that.

You need to add more doctests to this `__div__` function.

One has to balance that with the fact that for whatever reason, without this ticket a vast range of linear algebra in Sage is so utterly orders of magnitude too slow, as to make it painful and useless for research work.    This new code is **dramatically** faster than before.

[comment:82] was made out of frustration by seeing so many things here which are dubious. So okay, that's not constructive.

However in [comment:90], I noticed a mistake, mentioned it in the comment and fixed it in #17090. How is that not constructive?

That's true, but after William Stein's comment, I have fixed that back in #17090.

Please don't. I think it's absolutely good to improve matrices like you did here. The fact that I am making so many comments and creating follow-up tickets means that I care. I make mistakes, you make mistakes, that's normal and that's why have this review process.

My only complaint (and I still stand behind this) is that this ticket was given positive_review too soon. Ideally, those 3 follow-up tickets should have been reviewer patches on this ticket.

Marc -- don't you want to be a bad ass computer programmer, in addition to mathematician?   Just redo matrix_rational_dense, and you'll be way closer :-)

Well, you can look at the follow-up tickets #17090 and #17094 and see what I changed (and preferably review those tickets).

Some general things which haven't been mentioned yet:
1. clean-up your code when you change things: when you remove code, try to remove everything related to the old code. When you change code, the old structure might not be applicable anymore, so refactor if needed (e.g. the sepatate branch for `n <= 4` in `determinant()` no longer serves any purpose)
2. also fix documentation: when you change something, also change the corresponding documentation. When you copy/paste something, be sure to update documentation and doctests (see the various `set_unsafe` methods).
3. don't add unneeded import statements or includes, those add needless extra dependencies. Like, why did you add `include "sage/libs/ntl/decl.pxi"` in several places when you don't use any NTL code?
4. try to use correct formatting: spacing, indentation, docstring formatting (this was mostly good, but a bit messed up in `src/module_list.py`). If anything, this makes your code look more professional and less sloppy.
5. don't use `assert` for checking user input: use `assert` for when you *know* that something is true (but want to check just in case), not when you need to check that something is true.

Thanks! These comments are helpful indeed.

William -- I rather try to be a better mathematician...it has the advantage that although you get constantly evaluated, the evaluations are mostly anonymous :-). But that was in my to-do list. And it still is, despite my previous comments in this ticket!
