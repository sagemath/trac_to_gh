This is needed to build on Arch. (Of course the build breaks again when Arch gets the next readline version and corresponding bash.)

The tarball is at [http://www.ixsop.nl/sage/readline-6.3.008.tar.gz](http://www.ixsop.nl/sage/readline-6.3.008.tar.gz).

Depends on #16260

Wow, it has been two months since I built Sage (and ran into errors).

Yes, I think this is ready for review now.

Builds and passes `sage -t --long --all` for me on Debian Squeeze-LTS x86_64. Can't review since I'm author on this ticket.

The most significant change is for OS/X, so it should definitely be tested there.

The file shobj-conf.patch does more than described in SPKG.txt. Those extra things should probably be removed from shobj-conf.patch or added in SPKG.txt. I do not, however, think that this is part of "upgrade to readline 6.3". Also I can't do this, as I don't have access to BSD or non-ELF systems.

I dug into the revision history to see what various chunks of shobj-conf.patch were for.

The FreeBSD related chunks seem to be remnants from FreeBSD's transition from a.out to ELF. Upstream has code for that now, so I discarded those chunks.

For OS/X, I traced the changes back to a patch on macports. There the patch has been updated and I have included the new version now. I think this is the sane thing to do for OS/X. Anyway, that patch has been included in macports for 4 months now, and there are no open bugs at https://trac.macports.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&component=ports&summary=~readline&order=priority so that should be fine.
