Builds and passes `sage -t --long --all` for me on Debian Squeeze-LTS x86_64. Can't review since I'm author on this ticket.

The most significant change is for OS/X, so it should definitely be tested there.

The file shobj-conf.patch does more than described in SPKG.txt. Those extra things should probably be removed from shobj-conf.patch or added in SPKG.txt. I do not, however, think that this is part of "upgrade to readline 6.3". Also I can't do this, as I don't have access to BSD or non-ELF systems.
