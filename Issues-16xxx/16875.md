Win some perf with a couple of improvements. Nothing fantastic, but still worth taking.

Hello,

About your commit: I do not like the fact that we cache twice the same data. `_OA_cache` already contains everything.

The imports.... `T_T`

And they don't even appear in %prun `T_T`

Yo !

You may not like this additional caching (1Mb or RAM ? Yes I understand, that can be a problem) but what I do not like are public functions like yours with "the hack I need for my own code" that checks consecutive values. You just don't write that in a user-exposed function.

Here is a proposition: your two commits here are good and are useful, se we need them now. If this Mb of caching is a problem for you then we can remove it from this ticket and let it go like that.

Your function `orthogonal_array_available` looks a lot like the function `is_available(k,n_` I proposed to implement earlier in a "designs.orthogonal_arrays" orbject, along with `build(k,n)`, `best_k(n)`, etc... So if we have to do something like that we will do it properly with such functions.

I will also use the chance to convert the caching system to pure Cython, so that it will become a simple array lookup, nothing more complicated.

We can also keep this caching thing in the meantime, it's up to you.

Tell me and I will start writing the code.

Hello,

> You may not like this additional caching (1Mb or RAM ? Yes I understand, that can be a problem) but what I do not like are public functions like yours with "the hack I need for my own code" that checks consecutive values. You just don't write that in a user-exposed function.


Because your caching is not "the hack I need for my own code"? Moreover, in my `orthogonal_array_available` it makes not a big difference to remove the `mult` parameter. And if you prefer, I can set the name to `_orthogonal_array_available`. My problem is not the fact that you use memory, but the fact that you cache twice the same data.

The simplest would be to let this ticket go without `_cache_m_zero_one_two` and without `orthogonal_array_available`. And it is clear that the good solution would be to implement the Cython version of the function you suggest: `is_available`.

Yo !

> Because your caching is not "the hack I need for my own code"?


My function is cached and is named `_cache_m_zero_k_m`. It *SCREAMS* that it is not meant for users. Yours is named "orthogonal_arrayy_available" and supports a weird parameters aboit consecutive values.

> Moreover, in my `orthogonal_array_available` it makes not a big difference to remove the `mult` parameter. And if you prefer, I can set the name to `_orthogonal_array_available`. My problem is not the fact that you use memory, but the fact that you cache twice the same data.


You have nothing when the data being stored is 99% of useless pointers because it's dictionaries toward Integer objects, or when you store numbers between 0 and 1000 ont 64-bits integers, but it becomes a problem when instead of the useless data you store twice the same thing ? `:-P`

> The simplest would be to let this ticket go without `_cache_m_zero_one_two` and without `orthogonal_array_available`. And it is clear that the good solution would be to implement the Cython version of the function you suggest: `is_available`.


Okay ! Then I update this branch in a second and give it a positive review (all the code is yours). And I will begin to write this is_availabe function in a second, everything in Cython. Let's hope that it will make a big difference !
