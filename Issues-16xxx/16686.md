Try for instance:

```
sage: parametric_plot((sin, cos), (0, 2*pi), xmin = -2, xmax = 2, ymin = -2, ymax = 2)
```

The xmin and xmax limits are ignored, while the ymin and ymax limits are not.

This is not a bug in `parametric_plot`. It *was* a deliberate decision made in `plot`; I don't know why it was done this way. See #13368
