This doctest was introduced in #16162. It fails quite reliably (maybe 80% of the runs) on the AIMS snapperkob (Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64) buildbot:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(2**8) ## line 1416 ##
sage: x = polygen(K) ## line 1417 ##
sage: alarm(1) ## line 1418 ##
sage: (x**1000000+x+a).any_root() ## line 1419 ##

```

See #16850 for the underlying issue, this ticket is just to fix the doctest failure.

Not sure why the interrupt does not get caught here, maybe the code needs a little more sig_on/sig_off.
