Thank you, i will work on that Ticket Thursday.
We have, now, a working group : https://wiki.sagemath.org/thursdaysbdx.

I think, i will finish this ticket thursday.

2. I suggest to support Python 3 syntax as most as possible for any new module to get into sage for example by adding the following line at the top of the module:

See [this page of the developper's manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings):

```
All bibliographical references should be stored in the master bibliography file,
 SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst, in the format [...]
```

5. Out of curiosity, why does the `class _polyomino_row:` needs to be inside the class instead of simply in the module?

6. The class

```
class _drawing_tool:
    r"""
    Technical class to produce TIKZ drawing.
```

is of larger interest than just the parallelogram polyominoes (I often need such thing). But I think it is anormal to

```
sage: from sage.combinat.parallelogram_polyomino import _drawing_tool
```

I think you should rather create a new module:

```
sage: from sage.misc.tikz import DrawingTool
```

I have the idea of geting my module [TikzPicture](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe/blob/develop/slabbe/tikz_picture.py) into sage in the future. The class `DrawingTool` and `TikzPicture` could go in the same module. I let you create that module first into Sage.

For example if you install my package with `sage -pip install slabbe`, you may do:

```
sage: L = [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
sage: from slabbe import TikzPicture
sage: TikzPicture(latex(pp)).pdf()
'[...]/62669/tikz_mZXN3H.pdf'

In think it is a bug of set_factories. 
This example show the problem : 

```
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories import *
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories_example import *
sage: XYPairs()
AllPairs
sage: APS = XYPairs()
sage: APS.is_finite()
True
```

I will report that bug.

In ParallelogramPolyominoesFactory, I have commented the function add_constraint() that become nonImplemented, because i don't use them in the set_factory. I don't know if it is a good way to solve the problem, but I don't use that function, so, I don't know how to test it.

This is not correct :

```
+            EXAMPLES::
+
+            sage: PP=ParallelogramPolyomino
```
because you must indent the test lines by 4 spaces.

This is not correct :

```
+        EXAMPLES::
+            sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(
```
because you must have an empty line after `EXAMPLES::`

This is not a correct way to add a doctest :

```
         Return a default policy.
+
+        sage: ParallelogramPolyominoes._default_policy
```
because you have forgotten `EXAMPLES::`

You can just remove "add_constraints(self, cons, args_opts):", I think.

I would like to see this merged!  Here are a few comments concerning docstrings:

* the error messages in `check` need spell- and semantic checking :-)

* the references should be moved to `sage-develop/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`

* I do not understand the docstring in lines 819-821:

```

        Ensure that parallelogram polyominoes created by the enumerated sets
        and directly are the same and that they are instances of
        :class:`ParallelogramPolyomino`.
```

* docstrings of `widths` (line 1702) and `heights` (line 1843) should begin with imperative.

* concerning `val` (line 1976): this looks like a useful function, why not make it public?  It's docstring should be `Determine whether the cell at the given position is inside the parallelogram polyomino.`

* docstring of `_polyomino_row` could be `This is an internal class representing a single row of a parallelogram polyomino.`

* `diagramme` in line 2434 should be `diagram`.

Merging All Drawing Tools coming from you tikz package and the drawing tools of ParallelogramPolyomino is a big work : 
- we need to list all the needed functionality
- we need to merge the ParallelogramPolyomino codes and the code of your package
- we need to integrate the result on sage
- we need to make tests and documentation

I think its better to open a new ticket in order to close this one.
We will treat that new ticket after this one.

I opened that new ticket : ticket #26508
