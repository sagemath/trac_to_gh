<a id='comment:69'></a>Some more comments (just looking at the code, no test done yet):

3. `_get_path_in_pair_of_tree_from_box` similar methods do not have doctests.

4. (many occurrences) References format do not follow the conventions:

```

See [this page of the developper's manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings):

```
All bibliographical references should be stored in the master bibliography file,
 SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst, in the format [...]
```

5. Out of curiosity, why does the `class _polyomino_row:` needs to be inside the class instead of simply in the module?

6. The class

```
class _drawing_tool:
    r"""
    Technical class to produce TIKZ drawing.
```

is of larger interest than just the parallelogram polyominoes (I often need such thing). But I think it is anormal to

```
sage: from sage.combinat.parallelogram_polyomino import _drawing_tool
```

I think you should rather create a new module:

```
sage: from sage.misc.tikz import DrawingTool
```

I have the idea of geting my module [TikzPicture](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe/blob/develop/slabbe/tikz_picture.py) into sage in the future. The class `DrawingTool` and `TikzPicture` could go in the same module. I let you create that module first into Sage.

For example if you install my package with `sage -pip install slabbe`, you may do:

```
sage: L = [[0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0]]
sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(L)
sage: from slabbe import TikzPicture
sage: TikzPicture(latex(pp)).pdf()
'[...]/62669/tikz_mZXN3H.pdf'
```

In think it is a bug of set_factories. 
This example show the problem : 

```
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories import *
sage: from sage.structure.set_factories_example import *
sage: XYPairs()
AllPairs
sage: APS = XYPairs()
sage: APS.is_finite()
True
```

I will report that bug.

Now we have 100% of coverage.

In ParallelogramPolyominoesFactory, I have commented the function add_constraint() that become nonImplemented, because i don't use them in the set_factory. I don't know if it is a good way to solve the problem, but I don't use that function, so, I don't know how to test it.

<a id='comment:81'></a>This is not correct :

```
+            EXAMPLES::
+
+            sage: PP=ParallelogramPolyomino
```
because you must indent the test lines by 4 spaces.

This is not correct :

```
+        EXAMPLES::
+            sage: pp = ParallelogramPolyomino(
```
because you must have an empty line after `EXAMPLES::`

This is not a correct way to add a doctest :

```
         Return a default policy.
+
+        sage: ParallelogramPolyominoes._default_policy
```
because you have forgotten `EXAMPLES::`

You can just remove "add_constraints(self, cons, args_opts):", I think.

* concerning `val` (line 1976): this looks like a useful function, why not make it public?  It's docstring should be `Determine whether the cell at the given position is inside the parallelogram polyomino.`

* docstring of `_polyomino_row` could be `This is an internal class representing a single row of a parallelogram polyomino.`

<a id='comment:98'></a>Merging All Drawing Tools coming from you tikz package and the drawing tools of ParallelogramPolyomino is a big work : 
- we need to list all the needed functionality
- we need to merge the ParallelogramPolyomino codes and the code of your package
- we need to integrate the result on sage
- we need to make tests and documentation

I think its better to open a new ticket in order to close this one.
We will treat that new ticket after this one.

I opened that new ticket : ticket #26508

<a id='comment:107'></a>All the corrections of comment 85 was done.

The function __classcall_private__ needs to be implemented to work with SetFactory.
With that function, the parent method will work correctly.
