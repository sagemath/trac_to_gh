Well, short of this I agree with the commit. The only thing is that the "if ABORT_ON_ERROR:" added before the raise makes me wonder if anything is displayed when the exception is caught. Not having the exception is cool, thinking that nothing happened is something different `:-P`

And I do not know how to test that.

Unfortunately I have to leave right now, and I may not be near a computer for the next few days...

Thank you very much again, Volker ! I want to keep the links working, and this really helps to track them `:-)`

The actual error message consists of three lines and looks like

```
[geometry ] <autodoc>:0: ERROR: Unknown directive type "blah".
[geometry ] .. blah::
[geometry ] /home/vbraun/Code/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/geometry/cone.py:docstring of sage.geometry.cone:0: ERROR: Unknown directive type "foo".
```
If we raise the error on the first error line then we lose the important information about the file that contains the error. The updated patch will spit out all error messages in the file before aborting (or not abort if you pass `-k`).
