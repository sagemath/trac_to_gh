<a id='comment:8'></a>Well, short of this I agree with the commit. The only thing is that the "if ABORT_ON_ERROR:" added before the raise makes me wonder if anything is displayed when the exception is caught. Not having the exception is cool, thinking that nothing happened is something different `:-P`

And I do not know how to test that.

Unfortunately I have to leave right now, and I may not be near a computer for the next few days...

Thank you very much again, Volker ! I want to keep the links working, and this really helps to track them `:-)`
