In generic implementations of `f.quo_rem(g)`, an exception

```python
ArithmeticError: Nonunit leading coefficient
```
is raised as soon as the leading coefficient of `g` is not invertible. This was introduced by ticket #11593, and I mimicked the behavior in #16544. 

The change I propose is to try to compute the Euclidean division, and raise an exception

```python
ArithmeticError: division not exact (consider coercing to polynomials over the fraction field first)
```
when the computation is not possible. Then, `quo_rem` would produce less exceptions, and in particular give an answer each time the answer is not controversial (see below). 

**Note on the controverse.** There is a debate to know whether one should raise an exception when the division is not exact (as it is done for dense integer polynomials with the `NTL` implementation), or if one should silently return a result that has a mathematical meaning though it is not a Euclidean division (as it is done with the `flint` implementation). See #16276 as well as https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/UVrx5CG4qA0/WUz2RItJtF8J for this debate. My proposition is to already implement a more capable algorithm, and not to wait for the debate to be closed.

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
My proposition is as follows (say for the method `quo_rem` of the `class Polynomial_generic_dense`):

- Remove the test

  ```python
          if not other.leading_coefficient().is_unit():
              raise ArithmeticError("Nonunit leading coefficient")
  ```
  on lines 7484-7485 of `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx`.

- Change the line 7999 (`q = x[n+k-1]/y[n-1]`) by the following:

  ```python
              try:
                  q = R(x[n+k-1]/y[n-1])
              except TypeError:
                  raise ArithmeticError("Division not exact (consider coercing to polynomial over the fraction field first")
  ```

Does the change make sense?
