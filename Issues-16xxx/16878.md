Right now to test if a Sage integer is prime it is faster to call `prime_range` rather than `.is_prime()`...

```
sage: timeit("bool(prime_range(121,122))", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.09 µs per loop
sage:  timeit("bool(prime_range(1009,1010))", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 1.2 µs per loop
```
versus

```
sage: timeit("121.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 5.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit("1009.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 4.19 µs per loop
```

The patch does some tiny modifications in `integer.pyx` and we get

```
sage: timeit("121.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 812 ns per loop
sage: timeit("1009.is_prime()", number=10000)
10000 loops, best of 3: 730 ns per loop
```

We also modify `is_prime_power()` to return `False` for 1 and raise an error for non-integral rationals like `1/2`.

I don't think we should lower `PARI_PSEUDOPRIME_LIMIT` because it's also used in places where it's not bounded by `ULONG_MAX`, see `next_prime()` for example.

I like the idea, but I'm not sure that I like the interface with the `certificate` keyword.

How about a separate method `write_as_prime_power()` (raising `ArithmeticError` if it's not a prime power) or something?

Note that there is already `factor` that does the job. Moreover, having two methods (`is_prime_power` and `write_as_prime_power`) with the exact same code looks bad as well. From my implementation, it is clear that the `certificate` keyword only modifies the output.

My design choice also comes from the fact that this `certifcate` keyword is already in use (see `sage.graphs` or `sage.combinat.designs`). I am not particularly happy with it but I find it better than having two functions.

On the other hand, treating a Python exception takes time, and this `is_prime_power` is the kind of function that I might use in time critical code.

<a id='comment:37'></a>In `is_pseudoprime_small_power`, the fixed exponent bound of 1024 is clearly not acceptable.

The PARI implementation of `isprimepower()` is as follows: first do trial division by small primes up to 100. If we do not find a divisor, then find out if the number is a perfect power. This is now a lot cheaper since the exponent can be at most `log(n)/log(p)`, where `n` is the number to check and `p` the smallest prime that we didn't check in the trial division.

But overall, I would prefer PARI to add a new function `ispseudoprimepower()` such that Sage can interface it.

True, I forgot about here and it is [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/v6s2RI4dd1Q).

I see... I do not like the fact that we avoid pari `uisprimepower` for the range between `LONG_MAX` and `ULONG_MAX`. Especially because otherwise we import the `proof` module which takes some non negligible amount of time. We can either get rid of `smallInteger` (that would be bad if either `p` or `n` would be below `256`) or add a `smallunsignedInteger`

```
cdef inline Integer smallunsignedInteger(unsigned long value):
    """
    This is the fastest way to create a (likely) small positive Integer.
    """
    cdef Integer z
    if value <= small_pool_max:
        return <Integer>small_pool[value - small_pool_min]
    else:
        z = PY_NEW(Integer)
        mpz_set_ui(z.value, value)
        return z
```

What do you think?
