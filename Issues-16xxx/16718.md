```
We can define generators of a Cartesian (direct) product of groups as a Cartesian product of the generators with the identity elements. This will fix the issue noted in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/nlRGZpr_Je8.

```
sage: AG=cartesian_product([CyclicPermutationGroup(5),CyclicPermutationGroup(4),CyclicPermutationGroup(4)])
sage: AG.group_generators()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
sage: AG.j_classes()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
```

We will do so by defining a general method in the appropriate category.

This also works for infinitely generated groups, but it's a hack and is work very well. I've also copied this over to monoids as well. A note for the future, these functions should be split if we implement an axiom `FinitelyGenerated`.

Helloooooooooooooooooo !!

Why do you need to implement the same function twice ? Isn't there a way to say that `group_generators = monoid_generators` ?

Why don't all groups have a `monoid_generators` method ? They are monoids, aren't they ?

Hello !!

Could you add doctests for the infinite case ?

Also, why `M.monoid_generators().cardinality() != float('inf')` instead of `M.monoid_generators().is_finite()` ?

Done.

I've changed this to `in FiniteEnumeratedSets()` which is more restrictive, but it is safer. I've also added a second safety check in case `*_generators()` returns a tuple or a list (it shouldn't and maybe tuple/list should be considered as a objects in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`?).

Yo.

> I've changed this to `in FiniteEnumeratedSets()` which is more restrictive, but it is safer.

It is also more costly. Really it would all be okay if this was compiled code, but I keep thinking of what happens when a line like 

```
if all(M.monoid_generators() in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
  or isinstance(M.monoid_generators(), (tuple, list)) for M in F):
  ret = [lift(i, gen) for i,M in enumerate(F) for gen in M.monoid_generators()]
```
is executed and it really is awful... `monoid_generators()` is called once or twice per factor, the caching mechanism does its job to return the pre-computed generators if necessary, `FiniteEnumeratedSets()` is also created at each turn and because it is a `UniqueRepresentation` of something there is a lookup going on there too....

> I've also added a second safety check in case `*_generators()` returns a tuple or a list (it shouldn't and maybe tuple/list should be considered as a objects in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`?).

Don't know ... Then you would have stuff which is detected as `FiniteEnumeratedSet` but does not inherit the methods... Well...

Okay. Despite the fact that I really do not like categories and probably never will, thank you for fixing that, your patch does the job. Can you fix the broken doctests ? It can be set to `positive_review` afterwards.
