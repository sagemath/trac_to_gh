```
We can define generators of a Cartesian (direct) product of groups as a Cartesian product of the generators with the identity elements. This will fix the issue noted in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/nlRGZpr_Je8.

```
sage: AG=cartesian_product([CyclicPermutationGroup(5),CyclicPermutationGroup(4),CyclicPermutationGroup(4)])
sage: AG.group_generators()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
sage: AG.j_classes()
...
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
```

We will do so by defining a general method in the appropriate category.

This also works for infinitely generated groups, but it's a hack and is work very well. I've also copied this over to monoids as well. A note for the future, these functions should be split if we implement an axiom `FinitelyGenerated`.

Why do you need to implement the same function twice ? Isn't there a way to say that `group_generators = monoid_generators` ?

The code that only exists in your head again ....

Why don't all groups have a `monoid_generators` method ? They are monoids, aren't they ?

As for why this is not there for many groups is that they were implemented before monoids were considered in Sage (I believe).

Hello !!

Could you add doctests for the infinite case ?

Also, why `M.monoid_generators().cardinality() != float('inf')` instead of `M.monoid_generators().is_finite()` ?

Done.

I've changed this to `in FiniteEnumeratedSets()` which is more restrictive, but it is safer. I've also added a second safety check in case `*_generators()` returns a tuple or a list (it shouldn't and maybe tuple/list should be considered as a objects in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`?).

Yo.

> I've changed this to `in FiniteEnumeratedSets()` which is more restrictive, but it is safer.

It is also more costly. Really it would all be okay if this was compiled code, but I keep thinking of what happens when a line like 

```
if all(M.monoid_generators() in FiniteEnumeratedSets()
  or isinstance(M.monoid_generators(), (tuple, list)) for M in F):
  ret = [lift(i, gen) for i,M in enumerate(F) for gen in M.monoid_generators()]
```
is executed and it really is awful... `monoid_generators()` is called once or twice per factor, the caching mechanism does its job to return the pre-computed generators if necessary, `FiniteEnumeratedSets()` is also created at each turn and because it is a `UniqueRepresentation` of something there is a lookup going on there too....

> I've also added a second safety check in case `*_generators()` returns a tuple or a list (it shouldn't and maybe tuple/list should be considered as a objects in `FiniteEnumeratedSets()`?).

Don't know ... Then you would have stuff which is detected as `FiniteEnumeratedSet` but does not inherit the methods... Well...

Okay. Despite the fact that I really do not like categories and probably never will, thank you for fixing that, your patch does the job. Can you fix the broken doctests ? It can be set to `positive_review` afterwards.
