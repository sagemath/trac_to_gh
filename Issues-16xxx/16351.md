I would like to squeeze out some more speed of the `SearchForest` code, so I'm interested in this. I made #13580 a dependency since that is likely a lot closer than this is to getting into Sage. If you disagree, then we can reverse the order of the dependencies and I'd do the review once this is ready.

I just rebased this ticket on top of #13580 the code contains only an explanation of what `SearchForest` does with a nice picture from Nathann, Nicolas and nyself. It should be integrated during the move and the documentation cleanup.

Now that #13580 is in, the current branch contains just a small

Shall we create a separate ticket for that documentation chunk?

And refocus this one on moving the SearchForest code to

Thanks for finishing this task.I feel ashame I never finished it myself.

As a further todo, I think it will be nice to have

```diff
-class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(Parent):
+class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic):
```

There are few methods like `to_digraph` from the generic class that I like to use but are currently not available for the `forest` type.
