I just rebased this ticket on top of #13580 the code contains only an explanation of what `SearchForest` does with a nice picture from Nathann, Nicolas and nyself. It should be integrated during the move and the documentation cleanup.

Thanks for finishing this task.I feel ashame I never finished it myself.

As a further todo, I think it will be nice to have

```diff
-class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(Parent):
+class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic):
```

There are few methods like `to_digraph` from the generic class that I like to use but are currently not available for the `forest` type.
