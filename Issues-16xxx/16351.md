I just rebased this ticket on top of #13580 the code contains only an explanation of what `SearchForest` does with a nice picture from Nathann, Nicolas and nyself. It should be integrated during the move and the documentation cleanup.

Now that #13580 is in, the current branch contains just a small
self-contained documentation improvement. It seems worth and easy to
integrate soon, but somehow unrelated to this ticket, right?

Shall we create a separate ticket for that documentation chunk?

And refocus this one on moving the SearchForest code to
sage/sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx (more than by just a single
alias)?

That's right, these deprecated classes are deleted.

The deprecation happened in #6637 and announced on the ticket, I guess before deprecation warnings were invented?

Thanks for finishing this task.I feel ashame I never finished it myself.

As a further todo, I think it will be nice to have

```diff
-class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(Parent):
+class RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_forest(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_generic):
```

There are few methods like `to_digraph` from the generic class that I like to use but are currently not available for the `forest` type.
