Since #14284, `TestSuite` (more precisely `InstanceTester.some_elements`) tries to be fancy by choosing "some elements" using a random sample. The random sample is built using Python's `random.sample`, which requires its input to be a Sequence (i.e. the i-th element can be fetched with o[i]), or some dict-like object. This can get brittle with inputs where `__getitem__` is used for other purposes, or where unranking is just computationally expensive. The `some_elements` method also assumes `__len__` to be implemented and cheap enough.

Example:

```
sage: FF = IntegerModRing(29)  # needs to be >21 otherwise random.sample uses a different strategy
sage: tester = FF._tester(elements=FF, max_runs=5)
sage: list(tester.some_elements())
...
ValueError: first letter of variable name must be a letter
```


This ticket reduces the role of `InstanceTester.some_elements` to just do some argument parsing and ensure that at most "max_run" elements are returned. It only requires the input to be iterable.

If we want to have fancy random samples, we should define a specific protocol (typically P.sample()) for it, or just let parents decide on the strategy by defining some_elements appropriately.

This was originaly analyzed in #15919.

TODO: decide whether InstanceTester.some_elements should return a list or an iterator. A list would be more user friendly (though that's not critical since this is pretty low level) and maybe less error-prone (if a _test_method attempt to reuse the result twice). On the other hand, in case of failure of a _test_method, using an iterator would waste a bit less time before the failure occurs (no need to build all the elements).
