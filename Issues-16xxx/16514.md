Since a couple months, tracebacks are not more shown anymore in case of crash on startup, and instead is written
in a file. This slows down the workflow when tracking such crashes.

The purpose of this ticket is to make it easy for a sage developer to customize the behavior of Sage's intepreter in case of crash, and in particular to specify whether the crash traceback should be shown, and whether to start pdb. This could be either through new flags (e.g. --debug) or in a config file in .sage.

The relevant lines are in `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py`, where Sage implements a customized
crash handler `SageCrashHandler` deriving from `IPAppCrashHandler`, setting by default `show_crash_traceback=False` and `call_pdb=False`.

I am not sure what's the best way to implement this, so suggestions or implementations are most welcome!
