<a id='comment:22'></a>Hello Frédéric,

Instead of returning a `ValueError` could you show a deprecation warning instead? Something saying that the keyword is not used anymore, has been implicitly replaced by the only value available. This way one year from now we will be able to remove this keyword. Otherwise we'll keep it along forever.

I'm sorry but you can't just remove the 'ryser' flags on the doctests. 'ryser' was not architecture-dependent, but 'gale' is as it relies on a LP solver.

Given that you kindly replaced this exception I'll try to fix this myself in a commit. Sorry I'm a bit slow today, I'm sick and everything is slower than usual.

I thought that it would require some work, but as there is already a 'clean' doctest that tries random input and checks the behaviour in an architecture-independent way, I just flagged all the other doctests with '# random'. They are not checked anymore but still serve as documentation, and the checks still appear in the loop.
