Hello Frédéric,

Instead of returning a `ValueError` could you show a deprecation warning instead? Something saying that the keyword is not used anymore, has been implicitly replaced by the only value available. This way one year from now we will be able to remove this keyword. Otherwise we'll keep it along forever.

I disagree with removing this. We should fix the problem. Would you cut off your nose because you sneeze once in awhile?
