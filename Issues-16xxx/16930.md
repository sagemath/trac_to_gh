```
The "modulus" parameter for finite fields is handled by the fancy new `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py` and the implementations of finite fields should only take a polynomial as modulus.

Also improve creating prime finite fields with the non-default implementation.

Depends on #16927
Depends on #8373
