The construction of elements of the *m*-Selmer group of a number field from elements of the *m*-torsion of the class group uses an incorrect formula, as the following example shows:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(-5)
sage: p = K.primes_above(2)[0]
sage: S = K.selmer_group((), 4)
sage: all(4.divides(x.valuation(p)) for x in S)
False  # should be True
```
The class group is cyclic of order 2, generated by the unique prime ideal *p* above 2.  To construct an element of the *m*-Selmer group from it, for *m* even, one has to take a generator of the principal ideal *p<sup>m</sup>*.  However. the `selmer_group()` method currently uses a generator of *p*<sup>2</sup> for any even *m*.

I agree with the fact that there is a bug, and the prescribed fix is correct.  I tested the entire Sage library (since who knows where this code is used -- mostly in elliptic curve functions I think).

I was distracted by the notation in the doctest (and ticket description) which used S for the Sel;mer group and not for a set of primes, but no worries!
