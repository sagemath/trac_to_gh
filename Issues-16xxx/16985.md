For now at Poset class the code for `is_selfdual()` does just `is_isomorphic(self.dual())`. It of course works, but is quite slow on most cases. Before full isomorphic test one can at least check that number of maximal and minimal elements are same and that sorted lists of in- and out-degrees are same.

Could you provide timings for the latest improvement you added ?

Also: the code of `Poset.level_sets` is a call to `.hasse_diagram()`, so perhaps you should call that function instead.

How should this kind of codes be tested, what kind of random posets to use?

Simple test can be done with Sage without coding anything. For example after `L=Posets(6).list()` I just got

`len([P for P in L if P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 60.21 s,  Wall time: 65.77 s

`len([P for P in L if sorted(P._hasse_diagram.in_degree()) == sorted(P._hasse_diagram.out_degree()) and P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 38.73 s,  Wall time: 40.53 s

`len([P for P in L if sorted(P._hasse_diagram.in_degree()) == sorted(P._hasse_diagram.out_degree()) and [len(x) for x in P.level_sets()]==[len(x) for x in P.dual().level_sets()] and P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 28.94 s,  Wall time: 30.20 s

Difference grows bigger wiht `Posets(7)`, and is also bigger when coding this directly to `.py`-file.

There are 318 posets of size 6. Of those 30 pass first test but fails second, and 12 pass first and second test but fails last one. This is an example of poset passing 1. and 2. test:

`Poset([[0,1,2,3,4,5],[[1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 4]]])`.

I can calculate these numbers for 7- and 8-element posets if needed.

I don't understand. Of course we must sometimes do full test for isomorphicity. This is one example of those.

Saying `Poset({'a':['b']})._hasse_diagram.level_sets()` will return `[[0], [1]]`, not `[['a'], ['b']]`. But in any case, code seems to reverse an array, which is unneeded.
