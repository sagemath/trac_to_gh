Could you provide timings for the latest improvement you added ?

Also: the code of `Poset.level_sets` is a call to `.hasse_diagram()`, so perhaps you should call that function instead.

Timings depend on test set. But with all 7-element posets this seems to be about 10-times faster. On the other hand, when testing with 7-element posets that really are duals this runs about 10% slower.

How should this kind of codes be tested, what kind of random posets to use?

I was only talking of the improvement which uses level sets.

Hmmmm... With what we have at our disposal I suppose. But I wondered whether computing the label sets was much faster than isomorphism. It probably is, but I wondered `^^;`

Simple test can be done with Sage without coding anything. For example after `L=Posets(6).list()` I just got

`len([P for P in L if P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 60.21 s,  Wall time: 65.77 s

`len([P for P in L if sorted(P._hasse_diagram.in_degree()) == sorted(P._hasse_diagram.out_degree()) and P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 38.73 s,  Wall time: 40.53 s

`len([P for P in L if sorted(P._hasse_diagram.in_degree()) == sorted(P._hasse_diagram.out_degree()) and [len(x) for x in P.level_sets()]==[len(x) for x in P.dual().level_sets()] and P.is_selfdual()])` -> CPU time: 28.94 s,  Wall time: 30.20 s

Difference grows bigger wiht `Posets(7)`, and is also bigger when coding this directly to `.py`-file.

There are 318 posets of size 6. Of those 30 pass first test but fails second, and 12 pass first and second test but fails last one. This is an example of poset passing 1. and 2. test:

`Poset([[0,1,2,3,4,5],[[1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 4]]])`.

I can calculate these numbers for 7- and 8-element posets if needed.

I don't understand. Of course we must sometimes do full test for isomorphicity. This is one example of those.

Saying `Poset({'a':['b']})._hasse_diagram.level_sets()` will return `[[0], [1]]`, not `[['a'], ['b']]`. But in any case, code seems to reverse an array, which is unneeded.
