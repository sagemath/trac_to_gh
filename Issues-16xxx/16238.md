The method `__call__` of the class `EllipticCurveIsogeny` takes a second argument `output_base_ring`. It seems weird to me, do you find this is conventional?

Moreover, this method should be `_call_` in order to make the functionalities of `Map`  available.

<a id='comment:2'></a>It is not uncommon for `__call__()` to take extra (positional or keyword) arguments; this is used for example to implement `E(x,y)` as an alternative notation for `E((x, y))` to construct a point on an elliptic curve.

I think that you can rename `__call__()` to `_call_()` if you also implement `_call_with_args()`, for example as follows (the non-standard calling convention seems to be a consequence of Cython restrictions):

Since you are at it, you could clean the code of `__call__`. It does a lot of manual checking of parents, which should be taken care of automatically by the coercion system if you switch to `_call_`.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I've done the suggested modifications. The coercion staff is now handle by Map (the doctests concercing isogeny equality still fail, it'll be fix as soon as #11474 will be fix).

Currently, we can call `phi((1,0))`, but no `phi(1,0)` (in the same way we can call `E(1,0)`). Do you think it would be usefull to implement that? We should use something like:

```python

def _call_with_args(self, x, y=None,kwd={}):
    return self._call_(self.__E2(x,y))

```

But this simple code doesn't work at all! Indeed, when we call for example `phi(0,0)`, the first arg is first coerced to `phi.__E1(0)` and then passed to `_call_with_args`.

Should I overload `__call__`, in this way:

```python
def __call__(self,x,y=None):
    if y is None:
       return Map.__call__(self,x)
    else:
       return Map.__call__(self,(x,y))
```
?

But this looks a bit creepy to me.

The notation `phi((1, 0))` presumably works automatically because `(1, 0)` is an object that can be coerced into `E`.  It may not be the most expressive notation, but I see no reason not to keep it.  I think extending this to allow `phi(1, 0)` is unnecessary.
