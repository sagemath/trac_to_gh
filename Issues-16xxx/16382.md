We presently have:

```
sage: sage_getsource(hyperbolic_triangle) in open(sage_getfile(hyperbolic_triangle),'r').read()
False
```
The problem is that `hyperbolic_triangle` is wrapped and its source is provided by a `_sage_src_lines_()` method, but on the `getfile` front, there is no analogue, so the file isn't found. That means `edit` doesn't work properly.

One solution is to provide a parallel method `_sage_src_file_()`. Another, which requires more editing, is to change `sage_getsourcelines` to return a triple `([lines],lineno,filename)` instead of `([lines],lineno)` as it does now (it's a little strange to return a line number without the file into which this indexes anyway). Note that `filename` could end up being something that doesn't actually open, because interactively defined classes get funny "filenames" that, via the `inspect` linecache, actually can used to index source lines without having a file correspond to them.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Also, note:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P._sage_src_lines_()
TypeError: _sage_src_lines() takes no arguments (1 given)
```
which is currently relied on to detect a dynamic class instance. The method in question tries to make a static method, but the subsequent inclusion into a dynamic class dictionary seems to break this (hence, the method binds anyway and the call receives an unexpected `self` argument).

If one fixes `_sage_src_lines` (by for instance accepting an optional self argument), source retrieval gets broken! So I think the current implementation of `_sage_src_lines` is actually wrong. It should either be removed (and the rest of the infrastructure adapted to detect dynamic classes in a different way--which is possible, because its current desired behaviour is apparently to raise a `TypeError` on instances of dynamic classes, which could be refactored), or it should be implemented to return the correct contents. Of course `_sage_src_file` could then be corrected similarly.

Attempt to show that `_sage_src_lines_` doesn't return something useful:

```
sage: P._sage_src_lines_
<bound method JoinCategory.parent_class._sage_src_lines of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>
sage: P.__dict__['_sage_src_lines_']
<staticmethod at 0x3dec9b8>
sage: P.__dict__['_sage_src_lines_'].__func__()
(['    class ParentMethods:\n',
  '        """\n',
  '        Put methods for parents here.\n',
  '        """\n',
  '        pass\n'],
 1096)
```
As you can see:
- a static method in an instance dictionary binds anyway
- the source returned is not of the object we're interested in
