We presently have:

```
sage: sage_getsource(hyperbolic_triangle) in open(sage_getfile(hyperbolic_triangle),'r').read()
False
```
The problem is that `hyperbolic_triangle` is wrapped and its source is provided by a `_sage_src_lines_()` method, but on the `getfile` front, there is no analogue, so the file isn't found. That means `edit` doesn't work properly.

One solution is to provide a parallel method `_sage_src_file_()`. Another, which requires more editing, is to change `sage_getsourcelines` to return a triple `([lines],lineno,filename)` instead of `([lines],lineno)` as it does now (it's a little strange to return a line number without the file into which this indexes anyway). Note that `filename` could end up being something that doesn't actually open, because interactively defined classes get funny "filenames" that, via the `inspect` linecache, actually can used to index source lines without having a file correspond to them.

Also, note:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P._sage_src_lines_()
TypeError: _sage_src_lines() takes no arguments (1 given)
```
which is currently relied on to detect a dynamic class instance. The method in question tries to make a static method, but the subsequent inclusion into a dynamic class dictionary seems to break this (hence, the method binds anyway and the call receives an unexpected `self` argument).

If one fixes `_sage_src_lines` (by for instance accepting an optional self argument), source retrieval gets broken! So I think the current implementation of `_sage_src_lines` is actually wrong. It should either be removed (and the rest of the infrastructure adapted to detect dynamic classes in a different way--which is possible, because its current desired behaviour is apparently to raise a `TypeError` on instances of dynamic classes, which could be refactored), or it should be implemented to return the correct contents. Of course `_sage_src_file` could then be corrected similarly.

Attempt to show that `_sage_src_lines_` doesn't return something useful:

```
sage: P._sage_src_lines_
<bound method JoinCategory.parent_class._sage_src_lines of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field>
sage: P.__dict__['_sage_src_lines_']
<staticmethod at 0x3dec9b8>
sage: P.__dict__['_sage_src_lines_'].__func__()
(['    class ParentMethods:\n',
  '        """\n',
  '        Put methods for parents here.\n',
  '        """\n',
  '        pass\n'],
 1096)
```
As you can see:
- a static method in an instance dictionary binds anyway
- the source returned is not of the object we're interested in

In case someone wants to fix the fact that staticmethods on dynamicclasses end up binding anyway: I suspect the problem occurs somewhere in `getattr_from_other_class`, and it's probably an issue that the "getter" gets used twice. To illustrate:

```
sage: class T(object):
    @staticmethod
    def stat():
        pass
....:     
sage: t=T()
sage: t.stat
<function __main__.stat>
sage: T.__dict__['stat']
<staticmethod at 0x7009210>
sage: T.__dict__['stat'].__get__(t)
<function __main__.stat>
sage: T.__dict__['stat'].__get__(t).__get__(t)
<bound method ?.stat of <__main__.T object at 0x6ff0510>>
```
As you can see, the standard staticmethod getter returns the wrapped function object. However, functions ALWAYS have a getter method that binds them. So if an staticmethod attribute inadvertently is "got" twice (first retrieved from the "other" class, and then passed through its own getter another time), one would end up binding a static method. Fixing this is not within the scope of this ticket, though.
