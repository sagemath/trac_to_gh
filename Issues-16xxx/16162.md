This also replaces calls to `power_mod` by calls to `pow` with three arguments which uses implementation optimized code for modular exponentiation.

That will ease the implementation of special case more efficient methods.

Nope, the segfaults were surely caused by the `x**q` computation with `q = 2**50` (some overflow in NTL I'd say, but the issue might be a real one, at least now it does not happen anymore).

I added the `sig_on` magic to ensure you can interrupt the code (even in some of the  `while` loops, not only because of `x**q` with large `q` stuff).
But it seems to me that some `sig_on` are now useless and potentially wrong as some Python code might get called at some point (in the spirit of your Python interpreter remark I guess), even if it wasn't before, maybe because of the `pow` modifications, though it does not really make sense to me.
Maybe some of the `sig_on` should be removed, but I'd definitely say some are needed.

Feel free to have a deeper look and modify the code, I won't touch that before tuesday.
