```
In Py2 `map()` returns a list, while in Py3 `map()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.imap()` does in Py2).

The tool 2to3 wraps `map()` usages with a call to `list()`.


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import map` and to check the code.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

You are right.

In this case we should write

```
r = sum ( (x[2] for x in cycle) )
```

Feel free to fix it (and others), currently I have no time to check the necessity of `list()` wrapping.

```
- return "".join(map(lambda x: self._character_to_code[x], string))
+ return "".join([self._character_to_code[x] for x in string])
```
Wondering if this is a good step forward, given that you can join an iterator to a string:

```
>>> map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c'])
<map object at 0x7fd747ddee10>
>>> "blah".join(map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c']))
'aablahbbblahcc'
```
(Python 3).

---

```
- map(
- lambda x: chr(ord(x) + 49),
- list(str(num[0]))),
+ [chr(ord(x) + 49) for x in list(str(num[0]))],
```
Can't we get rid of the `list`?

---

```
- a,b,c,d,e,f = map(G,R)
+ a,b,c,d,e,f = list(map(G,R))
```
This seems to not be necessary:

```
>>> a,b,c = iter([1,2,3])
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>> c
3
```

---

This is unnecessary:

```
- if all(map(lambda s: s.is_final, state.label())):
+ if all([s.is_final for s in state.label()]):
```
If anything then `all` definitely works on iterators.

I have no problems with `cmdline.py`. Results keep the same with and without merging `origin/develop` into `16073`.

Strange! And Volker just released sage-6.5.beta0 and auto-merge failed again ... :-(

By the way, back in June I was working to replace `map` with list comprehension or generator expressions (mostly). It was not quite complete when I took some time off.

I want to give that approach a fresh start on sage-6.5.beta0. I will describe the reasoning tomorrow (or so ...).

I uploaded a new branch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`.

My goal is to replace all `map` calls with list comprehension or generator expressions. Currently there are still about 40 `list(map(...` in the code (somehow my regexp did not find them :-/ ) and a number of `map`s in the doctests. So there is still some work to do.

The drawback of wrapping `map` with `list` is that in Python2 this is redundant.
If a context accepts iterators then in Python2 `map` cannot exploit this (as it returns a list). Remapping `map` in Python2 on its iterator version `itertools.imap` requires extra code.

The current branch does change list comprehensions to generator expressions in all possible cases. I would rather leave this refactoring to a new ticket since there are lots of applicable cases separate from 16073.

I am very much interested in feedback to `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`.

No, unfortunately there are still a significant number of `map`s in the code base.

`@`Andr√©: Can you please move the branch `public/16073` from this ticket into a new, separate ticket. Then I will review the change. - Reason: I will create one (maybe two) extra tickets/changes (this is now #18531) for the leftover `map`s that I found during the review of #18473 and #18474. And I would prefer that this tickets only refers to the tickets containing the changes.

There are still a lot of `map()` call in the code. 

But *not all* occurrences must be  removed: there are a number of places where a Py3 `map()`-iterator leads to the same result as the Py2 `map()`.

Here is a long (but incomplete) list:

```
all(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
any(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
bytearray(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
dict(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
filter(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
frozenset(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
list(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
map(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
max(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
min(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
reduce(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
set(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sorted(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
tuple(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
zip(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

''.join(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
a,b,c* = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
x[i:j] = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
a_dict.update(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
file.writelines(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
math.fsum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

and MANY functions in module itertools.

for i in here_is_an_iterable_allowed:
    pass
[2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed]
(2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
```

But if the use of `map` includes a `lambda` then replacing it with a list comprehension improves the readability!
