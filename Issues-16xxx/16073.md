```
In Py2 `map()` returns a list, while in Py3 `map()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.imap()` does in Py2).

The tool 2to3 wraps `map()` usages with a call to `list()`.


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import map` and to check the code.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

The code would now certainly benefit from changing expressions like `list(map(...))` into a list comprehension. 

This is more pythonic, more readable (especially in the case `list(map(lambda ...))` ) and it avoids redundant list creation in Python 2. But it's a lot of stuff to check and change ...

The patch is red.

Either way, shouldn't it be only wrapping some of the uses, rather than all of them?

You are right.

In this case we should write

```
r = sum ( (x[2] for x in cycle) )
```

Feel free to fix it (and others), currently I have no time to check the necessity of `list()` wrapping.

```
- return "".join(map(lambda x: self._character_to_code[x], string))
+ return "".join([self._character_to_code[x] for x in string])
```
Wondering if this is a good step forward, given that you can join an iterator to a string:

```
>>> map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c'])
<map object at 0x7fd747ddee10>
>>> "blah".join(map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c']))
'aablahbbblahcc'
```
(Python 3).

---

```
- map(
- lambda x: chr(ord(x) + 49),
- list(str(num[0]))),
+ [chr(ord(x) + 49) for x in list(str(num[0]))],
```
Can't we get rid of the `list`?

---

```
- a,b,c,d,e,f = map(G,R)
+ a,b,c,d,e,f = list(map(G,R))
```
This seems to not be necessary:

```
>>> a,b,c = iter([1,2,3])
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>> c
3
```

---

This is unnecessary:

```
- if all(map(lambda s: s.is_final, state.label())):
+ if all([s.is_final for s in state.label()]):
```
If anything then `all` definitely works on iterators.

Strange! And Volker just released sage-6.5.beta0 and auto-merge failed again ... :-(

By the way, back in June I was working to replace `map` with list comprehension or generator expressions (mostly). It was not quite complete when I took some time off.

I want to give that approach a fresh start on sage-6.5.beta0. I will describe the reasoning tomorrow (or so ...).

I uploaded a new branch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`.

My goal is to replace all `map` calls with list comprehension or generator expressions. Currently there are still about 40 `list(map(...` in the code (somehow my regexp did not find them :-/ ) and a number of `map`s in the doctests. So there is still some work to do.

The drawback of wrapping `map` with `list` is that in Python2 this is redundant.
If a context accepts iterators then in Python2 `map` cannot exploit this (as it returns a list). Remapping `map` in Python2 on its iterator version `itertools.imap` requires extra code.

The current branch does change list comprehensions to generator expressions in all possible cases. I would rather leave this refactoring to a new ticket since there are lots of applicable cases separate from 16073.

I am very much interested in feedback to `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`.

The 2 branches (the current `public/16073` and `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`) are alternative approaches. 
I did not want to be so impolite and just swap the branches :-)
And I did not think it is appropriate to open a separate ticket.

<a id='comment:54'></a>
There are still a lot of `map()` call in the code. 

But *not all* occurrences must be  removed: there are a number of places where a Py3 `map()`-iterator leads to the same result as the Py2 `map()`.

Here is a long (but incomplete) list:

```
all(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
any(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
bytearray(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
dict(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
filter(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
frozenset(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
list(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
map(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
max(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
min(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
reduce(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
set(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sorted(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
tuple(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
zip(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

''.join(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
a,b,c* = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
x[i:j] = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
a_dict.update(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
file.writelines(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
math.fsum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

and MANY functions in module itertools.

for i in here_is_an_iterable_allowed:
    pass
[2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed]
(2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
```

But if the use of `map` includes a `lambda` then replacing it with a list comprehension improves the readability!
