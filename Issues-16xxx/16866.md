I am trying to review this patch but I am lost in many places for the moment, so it may not be ligthning quick. About `one_cyclic_tiling`: the DLX algorithm is a pure exhaustive search. It enumerates all subsets of tiles, and explores everything until the current set cannot be extended anymore. There is no "smart cut" to detect easily that something cannot be completed. That algorithm is nothing but a "very careful and smart" implementation of that search, and so I do not believe that it is always the best.

Theoretically, what should be called there is `IncidenceStructure.packing` (this is exactly the problem that you want to solve).

I do not expect it to be the best.

> Theoretically, what should be called there is `IncidenceStructure.packing` (this is exactly the problem that you want to solve).


I would agree but the timings I got are not convincing. Please test the file I attached to the ticket

```
sage: timeit("t = test_all1(5,10)")
5 loops, best of 3: 78 ms per loop
sage: timeit("t = test_all1(6,12)")
5 loops, best of 3: 444 ms per loop
```
against

```
sage: timeit("t = test_all2(5,10)")
5 loops, best of 3: 267 ms per loop
sage: timeit("t = test_all2(6,12)")
5 loops, best of 3: 1.21 s per loop
```

The case of one tile on a circle is very symmetric and there might even be something better. Note also that for my instances the size of the tile is small compared to the size of the set.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Hello,

I tried to simplify the explanations a bit but I still do not understand the implementation. In particular I do not understand why you have this `-1` in the definition of `A`, and why you seem to solve a tiling problem on `A` and not on `\Delta A`.

Also, what would you think of removing the `one_cyclic_tiling` function? The name is not particularly meaningful, it is three lines long, only used once?...

Could you also add your new functions to the index at the top of the file?

My modifications can be found at `u/ncohen/16866`, but of course in that version your comments in the code use notations that I removed from the function's doc.

I can change that once I understand the implementation better.

Thanks,

Nathann

True but there is a formula in my docstring:

```
   It is easy to verify (see [Wi72]_) that we have for `k` odd `\Delta H^{2mt}
    =  A H^{mt}` while for `k` even `\Delta (H^{2mt} \cup \{0\}) = A H^{mt}`.
    Here `\Delta B` is the set of differences of distinct elements in `B`.
```
And you can check that `# (A H^{mt}) = #A # H^{mt}` has cardinality k(k-1).

Right, tiling/packing I do not care but there exists `sage.combinat.tiling` for some 2-dimensional tilings with polyominos.

Nope, and I do not need to do so. I want that my set of differences cover the whole H. Because all differences are a union of cosets of H<sup>mt</sup>, you can quotient out by H<sup>mt</sup> (i.e. reasoning in terms of the cosets xH<sup>mt</sup>).

Once you checked that the elements of A belong to distinct cosets mod H<sup>mt</sup>, you need to find a set of translates {x_1 A, x_2 A, ..., x_k A} that tile (or pack) the quotient H/H<sup>mt</sup>

Well, for a start I had no idea at first what was this "A" that you defined, least of all why you have this `-1`. Then you seemed to say that all differences belonged to different cosets of `H^{mt}` (I don't understand what this set is), but it seems to mean that you can only consider the differences obtained with 1.

I don't get why you have this `A.append(K.one())`, I would have expected `-K.one()` (i.e. the difference 0-1). Then I do not understand the cut with the `len(set(logA))`.

> What do you mean by "the same time". There is the same number of tiles in the packing at the end but if you ignore the symmetries there are much more possible translations.


I do not get exactly what your reduction of the ground set means with respect to the partition instance. What I mean is that an instance with the A0 U A0', A1 U A1', ... above is totally equivalent (in terms of resolution, and in terms of time) to an instance with A0, A1, ...

I was wondering if that was the difference that there is, in this branch, between considering the cosets that you mention and not considering them.

> That my code works and that it is good to have smaller instances of the problem to solve.


It is not necessarily an improvement to reduce the number of vertices, e.g. the example above. And so far I do not understand how your code works.

No. I want that all differences belong to different coset. This is something that need to be checked and which are precisely the two lines

```
    if len(set(logA)) != m:
        return None
```

> I don't get why you have this `A.append(K.one())`, I would have expected `-K.one()` (i.e. the difference 0-1). Then I do not understand the cut with the `len(set(logA))`.


This comes from computing what is Delta {1, r, r<sup>2</sup>, ..., r<sup>k-1</sup>} (where r is a k-th root of unity). If you do that you will see that it is the same as {+1, -1} A H<sup>mt</sup>. In the case of k even you want to compute Delta {0, 1, r, ..., r<sup>k-2</sup>} (where r is a (k-1)-th root of unity).

For the cut, see above.

Do you think that the tiling problem that you solve is equivalent, by the previous remarks, to the non-reduced problem ? If so, that would make it easier for me to understand.

H is the set of invertible elements in the finite field (it has cardinal q-1 and form a group under multiplication. H<sup>j</sup> is the set of j-th power in H.

In our context, H<sup>mt</sup> is the set of (2k)-th root of unity or 2(k-1)-th root of unity depending on the parity of k. It is also {+1, -1} H<sup>2mt</sup> where H<sup>2mt</sup> is the set of k-th root of unity or (k-1)-th root of unity (depending on the parity.

Yes. If you solve the big one, you solve the small one (and conversly).

I do have reasons (but it is not very important though).

More importantly, I want to keep the shortcut if some element of A belong to the same coset of H<sup>mt</sup>. And I do not want to compute these cosets and then forgot about them...
