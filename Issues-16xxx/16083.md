Jernej reported that this solver was faster than cliquer on some instances.

So we need it `:-P`

Nathann,

as promised here are my comments !

1. I was not able to test the code since I cannot figure out how to install the module. What am I supposed to do with the tar.bz2?

2. Following are some comments about the code/politics:

   2.1. The program mcqd consists of a single .h file. Since the author of the code agrees that we can use the program in Sage, is there any reason not to simply put this .h file along with the .pyx module? This way we can also tweak the file a bit (I'd like to remove debug stuff and unnecessary verbosity counters that are present in the code)

   2.2 (mcqd.pyx) The variable c0 is a pointer to c. Hence I am wondering, why do you need to allocate memory ? On line 39 you assign the ptr c to it and lose the reference to the allocated space.  

   2.3  (mcqd.pyx) Lines 30-37. Can they be made shorter by using the fact (is it true ????) that sage_free(NULL) is legal?

   2.4 (mcqd.pyx) Can we get rid of the memset by using sage_calloc on c?

   2.5 (mcqd.pyx) At the very end C should be deleted.

Yoooooooooooo !

> 1. I was not able to test the code since I cannot figure out how to install the module. What am I supposed to do with the tar.bz2?

Save it in SAGE_ROOT/upstream/ and run "sage -f mcqd" (on the right branch)

> 2.1. The program mcqd consists of a single .h file. Since the author of the code agrees that we can use the program in Sage, is there any reason not to simply put this .h file along with the .pyx module? 

Yes : the code has not been reviewed. And it "may" be updated, which is why we try not to change third-party code.

>    2.2 (mcqd.pyx) The variable c0 is a pointer to c.

?... No, it is not `O_o`

c0 is a pointer to `n*n` booleans.

>    2.3  (mcqd.pyx) Lines 30-37. Can they be made shorter by using the fact (is it true ????) that sage_free(NULL) is legal?

Right. Done

>    2.4 (mcqd.pyx) Can we get rid of the memset by using sage_calloc on c?

Done.

>    2.5 (mcqd.pyx) At the very end C should be deleted.

Why ? This is done automatically, isn't it ? You don't have to dealloc objects when nothing else points toward them.

The new code looks good except for a minor question:

Why you use  double variables for the adjacency matrix? Is there any benefit from allocating a n*n matrix and using a nested for loop to fill it?

What do you mean by "double variables" ? Do you mean that I allocate both "c" (linear size) and "c0" (quadratic size) ?

If so, that is because what MCQD expects is the vector `c`, which  points toward the entries of `c0`.
