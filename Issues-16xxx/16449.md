Hi Jayant,

The user positioning works as advertised. Very nice!

I just have some minor issues left. Look at the result of executing this code:

```
M=matroids.named_matroids.BetsyRoss()
pos={}
s="abcde"
t="fghij"
x=1.61
y=1/1.61
for i in range(5):
    pos[s[i]]=(RR(x*sin(2*pi*i/5)), RR(x*cos(2*pi*i/5)))
    pos[t[i]]=(RR(y*sin(2*pi*(i+1/2)/5)), RR(y*cos(2*pi*(i+1/2)/5)))
pos['k']=(0,0)
M.show(pos_method=1, pos_dict=pos)
```

This gives a star-like object. The input is clearly centered at (0,0) and has rotational symmetry. 

- The output of show() is flattenened (on my screen) and there is some empty space above the image. 
- If you show the output generated by plot(), then there is no flattening, but the some of the dots representing the groundset elements are cut by the boundary of the image.

So I wonder, could you perhaps get rid of the flattening in show()? The behaviour of the boundary is another thing. The minimal solution is to simply state the position of the windowframe in the docstring, and leave it to the user to accomodate. A more advanced solution is auto-framing the given picture, but then you should somehow make sure that all the dots and curves fall completely within the frame. 

Finally, one more request. I see that the point positioning of M in the above example is cached, so that if I just do M.show() again I get the same nice picture. Could you create a command M._fix_positions(pos_dict) which will likewise fix the point positions, but without showing or plotting the matroid? I guess I could call M.plot() with a user point positioning once and ignore the output to that effect, but I'm fairly sure you can get the same result without calling all the plot routines. I want to fit the named_matroids of rank <=3 with a nice default point positioning, so I could use a command like that.

Some more pedantic comments:

1) There are some formatting issues: try to wrap lines at 78 characters, and get rid of trailing whitespace. You may want to use a pep8 checking tool.
2) Some doctests fail. You can run them by writing

./sage -t src/sage/matroids/matroids_plot_helpers.py

from the base Sage directory.

I'll test-drive the code later this morning.

These are hard to track down, since line numbers are relative to the comment block, and it doesn't tell you which block we're in. But it's safe to assume these occur in your docstrings.

The white text labels are an unfortunate choice, as illustrated here:

```
M1 = Matroid(groundset=['Carolyn', 'Mike', 'Rudi', 'Stefan', 'Jayant', 'Dillon', 'Hassler'], field=GF(2), reduced_matrix=[[1,1,0,1],[1,0,1,1],[0,1,1,1]])

M1.show()
M2.show()
```
The following results in an error:

```
M3 = matroids.Uniform(1,6)
M3.show()
```

```

This should result in a "NotImplementedError", but doesn't do anything:

In order to keep the _cached_info from becoming a mess, I suggest naming the keys "plot_positions" and "plot_lineorders".

When typing

```
M = matroids.named_matroids.NonFano()
M.show? <tab key>
```
in a notebook, you can see some formatting issues (possibly related to the docbuild errors I mentioned above). Also, the "limits" option is undocumented. It's ok, by the way, to cross reference the "plot" method from the "show" method, instead of copying and pasting all documentation.

There are still issues with parallel elements and low-rank matroids.

This is a good example:

```
M = matroids.PG(3,2).contract(0)
M.show()
M.simplify().show()
```
Also, with the same example, specifying a basis goes wrong:

```
M.show(B=[5,6,7])
```
gives

```

    lines.append([B1[pairs[i-1][0]]])
IndexError: list index out of range
```
I'm not so sure about the output of

```
M3 = matroids.Uniform(1,6)
M3.show()
```
What does the set mean? Why is it so far removed from the point? Putting *all* elements from the parallel class into the set is clearer. And leave the point empty, or give it a new label (use the sage.matroids.utilities.newlabel function) and write on the sidelines

n = {0,1,2,3,4,5}

(where n is the new label).

Finally, I'd go for a lighter gray for the points.

Please test thoroughly with lots of examples, especially degenerate ones, before setting this to "needs_review" again.

You need to make sure the "newlabel" method gives a unique new label for each parallel class. Also, you can (and should) plot rank-0 matroids: they're just a bunch of loops.
