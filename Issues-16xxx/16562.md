<a id='comment:32'></a>In ALGORITHM part of the docstring of `separable_model`, 
'Proposition 4.1' should be replaced with 'Proposition 4.8';
this is where the claim we need is explicitly stated.

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say. My point is that there could be a separable model but we cannot find it yet, e.g., `k(t)(x,y|y^p-t)`, in that case it would raise a NotImplementedError which is better than raising a ValueError saying that `k(t)` must be perfect.
