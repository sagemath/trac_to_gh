Current `Fan.subdivide()` method cannot deal with fans generated by non-full-dimensional cones since it relies on PALP. In addition it is overly complicated. So let's use PPL cones for subdivision, since our toric cones already rely on them a lot. Speed-wise new method seems to work 2-3 times faster than the old one, but main advantages are brevity of code and absence of artificial limitations.

I've also cleaned up related code a bit and deprecated `Cone.lattice_polytope` whose primary purpose was to use PALP for subdivision.

Hi Andrey,

I've looked at the patch at it looks good - it's always nice to get rid of `LatticePolytope`. ;-)
One quick question: Is there any reason you're not caching the `polyhedron()` method of `Cone`?

No, the merge went through cleanly. I just merged the development branch in to see whether it is working with the current version. Otherwise I wouldn't have noticed the doctest warning because of the line number, since that has only recently been included (#16626). And I then based the new commit on the merged branch since it saved a lot of time when building Sage. I hope Volker will forgive the extra commit.

I just noticed that `polytope()` only seems to get used in the doctests - so not caching does make perfect sense. If you're happy, then you can set this to positive review.
