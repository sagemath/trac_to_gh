This ticket aims to raise awareness for slow doctests. Some are very time consuming just because the author wants to show off the capabilities of their code, and will sooner or later hurt our ability to run the testsuite. Really, doctests should be as fast as possible while providing adequate coverage.
* Make the `--warn-long` option a warning 
* Enable it by default (with 60s time limit)

Especially when it is active by default one may want to turn it off and my first place to look would definitely be `sage --help` and `sage --advanced`. I think there's value in keeping those complete wrt. command line options. If there are options there that are too complicated to document fully, you can provide a pointer to other doc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 95.2 seconds
    cpu time: 471.7 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 495.0 seconds
```

For the summary, I have something like this in mind (the output may be
sorted or unsorted according to the highest time)

```
The following files took more than 36.6 s to doctest:
[43.19 s] src/sage/plot/contour_plot.py
[80.43 s] src/sage/plot/graphics.py
[95.00 s] src/sage/plot/plot.py
```
I haven't had a close look at the code, so I am not sure if it is possible
to provide a summary like this.

The time limit is per doctest, not per file.

I don't mind a summary at the end but I don't think its necessary for this ticket. If you want to implement it be my guest, but I don't plan on doing it.

Sorry, took me some time to look through all this since I am not familiar with the code in `sage/doctest`. This sequence of patches looks good to me. I don't see any problems.
