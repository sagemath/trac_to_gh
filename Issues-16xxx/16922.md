Hi Nathann,

I got a lot of segmentation error while running the tests with this branch! Do you know what happen?

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

Sorry about that. Don't know where the segfaults came from, but when I solved the bug about the "more than 4 values needed to unpack" there was none left.

Also, I rewrote history to move this last commit above its dependencies (in which commits had been added in the meantime).

This should be better now.

By the way: the current implementation may look a bit "hacky". The thing is that it is 'a bit too early' to implement this construction, because at the moment there are no 'nice' functions to query the database of incomplete orthogonal arrays, and there is none yet because caching incomplete orthogonal arrays is much harder than caching orthogonal arrays (more parameters, mainly !). In the future we may even have find functions for incomplete orthogonal arrays and stuff.

Well, I have to write that and because it is not exactly straightforward to get a good design (and because it requires a lot of 'administrative' code) I implemented that first.

Still, it works and it is not so bad.

Well, just know that I am not intending to leave that code in the current state. Though I tried to not make it too awful either, and of course the review is there to fix anything you will not like.

Branch updated.

Nathann

Hi Nathann,

I changed the complexity of `multiple` by one order. And we can win more by cutting some of the branches (if I got the value `v` in `m` steps then I can not be bigger than `v + (k-m) max_value` at the end).

Have a look and tell me if it is worth it to add this cut.

True, True. Well done `O_o`

Well, technically can't we do it with `log(k)` iterations instead of `k` ?

I mean, if you call `S^n={x_1+...+x_n: x_i \in S}` then you can use the log algorithm to compute the power of a matrix, can't you ? And you can do even faster is you initialize `D` with `D = {r*x:tuple([x]*r) for x in S for r in tuple(range(cutoff/x+1))}`.

I still don't know how to write that nicely `T_T`

What is the point of making it decrease toward zero ? `O_o`

To have more meaningful comments like
`if (vv > 0 and   # The new integer i is too big` ?

Honestly I do not care, this will be rewritten soon anyway. But why would you do something like that ?

You even do `for j in range(k-1,-1,-1)` which is totally equivalent to `for j in range(k)` given that you do not use j. Only to make it more complicated ?...

Hum. `j` **is** useful as it is the remaining number of steps and allow to cut branches when the maximum number of steps allowed (i.e. `k_max`) is relatively small.

```
