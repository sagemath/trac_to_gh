Make the IPython html-based notebook work just like the sage command line.

In particular: make zeromq and pyzmq standard packages.

Its cute. I also wanted to call the Parent object that owns the Singular ring "Frodo". Sometimes, you have to resist being cute ;-)

Since there is bound to be more than one notebook, I think its best to go with `sage --notebook-foo` or `--notebook=foo`. With just `sage --notebook` being some suitable default.

Such as `sage --notebook-cloud`, for example.

Well, it might still be good to make it more easily discoverable with an alias or something, just because of the English syntax order.

Once we have this it would be easy to make html/tex output work in a configurable way.\n\nI'm glad you're working on this, since I've been meaning to do something like this for Sage for a long time, since it is needed for `SageMathCloud`.   Unfortunately, I'm concerned that this approach will cause me more trouble than help, at least for me.  With `SageMathCloud` I have to customize all of the outputs you mention above, and I think the above approach (and what you've implemented in this patch), does not provide a way for me to do it.  I would have to directly edit the source code of Sage, which I don't want to do (since it breaks people's custom installs).    Right now, SMC monkey patches *all* of the show methods, except for 3d graphics, which can't be monkey patched, due to being in Cython.

The `_graphics_()` hook then can pick the best choice amongst these possibilities. This works fine for the problem of finding a suitable graphics file format.

> The same idea should be extended to text/html/latex output as well. The user specifies which formats he wants (or his frontend can display), and Sage then picks the best representation. I'll work on refactoring the `_graphics_()` hook into a more general solution (probably called `_repr_rich()`) on a followup ticket. Once we have this it would be easy to make html/tex output work in a configurable way.

I'm glad you're working on this, since I've been meaning to do something like this for Sage for a long time, since it is needed for `SageMathCloud`.   Unfortunately, I'm concerned that this approach will cause me more trouble than help, at least for me.  With `SageMathCloud` I have to customize all of the outputs you mention above, and I think the above approach (and what you've implemented in this patch), does not provide a way for me to do it.  I would have to directly edit the source code of Sage, which I don't want to do (since it breaks people's custom installs).    Right now, SMC monkey patches *all* of the show methods, except for 3d graphics, which can't be monkey patched, due to being in Cython.    The idea that "show" can be implemented by saving to a file format, then calling some other function is insufficient, since in some cases one wants to query an object in various ways as part of show.  What is really needed is a hook so that users can *replace* the show method altogether at runtime if they want. 

So if you can do all of the above, but *also* provide a hook for replacing every show method by one of the user's choosing, especially supporting 3d graphics which can't be monkey patched, then I'm on board.

It's actually been very easy to maintain for almost two years now, since Sage's 2d and 3d graphics, etc., are all VERY stable code for the last 3 years.  However, I don't like doing it.  Amusingly, what you're doing now is the first situation that could make it harder.

> And that means a compute kernel starting with a custom displayhook or piggy-backing on the Sage-IPython ZMQ kernel. I can't see the SMC code so I can't really help with that, 

All relevant Python code is BSD or GPL'd licensed.    The latest versions are always the Python files in ~/.sagemathcloud in any SageMathCloud project.  If you want me to post a snapshot somewhere else I can. 

SageMathCloud makes absolutely no use of ZMQ or IPython.   However, it uses a custom displayhook.

> but I do intend to write the necessary framework to make implementing the displayhook easy. And powerful enough to include graphics, latex, and html output if desired.

Cool -- that's exactly what I want -- I way to make the necessary framework for implementing the displayhook easy, instead of just replacing show methods.

Anyway, I'm thrilled you're working on this, and I hope you'll keep SMC in mind for your design, so that I can rewrite my code to use your framework instead of monkey patching.

You are right. Running "make" fixed the problem. I can now open it and continue the review.

I do not know what goes in this ticket and what doesn't. For instance, as of now I believe the description of the ticket as been fulfilled ("IPython html-based notebook work just like the sage command line", "make zeromq and pyzmq standard packages"). And it could get a positive review.

But it would be nice if output like images would appear in the notebook as it is suggested in the screeshot. Also, I have some problems viewing the documentation. More precisely,


1. Graphics shows just below the cell which is great: `plot(x^2,0,10)` but using `plot(x^2,0,10).show()` opens in an outside window. Is this a bug, or intended?

2. Animate opens in a outside window as well:

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: a = animate((cos(c*pi*t) for c in sxrange(1,2,.2)))
sage: a.show()
```

3. 3d Graphics objects plots shows also below the cell as a Tachyon image and running `.show` opens in a outside window.

4. I saw you added some links in the Help Menu. Unfortunately, I get `404: Not Found` on the six links where one of them is `http://localhost:8888/static/a_tour_of_sage/index.html`.

I tested the same files on my machine and I get:

```
sage -t src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # Killed due to bus error
sage -t src/sage/repl/notebook_ipython.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # 9 doctests failed

sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx  # 6 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
```

Full log is available here: http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/slabbe/trac_16996.log

Note: the link is broken. I don't know why. I scp the file on my account on the server `sage.math.washington.edu` as before. What is the url of it then?

Hi Sébastien,

On my machine, with branch u/vbraun/sage_ipynb merged into sage 6.4 beta4, all the above tests passed. Which version of Sage are you using ?

I don't know enough about the graphics/plotting interface to know if the changes here are sensible. Anyone else? My only impression is that the `graphics_file` module should have more documentation: I don't know at a glance why or how to use it. The doctest coverage for that file is bad, also. Everything else looks okay, although I haven't looked in great detail at all of it.

It seems there is a space missing in the usage line :`sage-notebook` instead of `sage -notebook`.

```
$ sage -notebook -h
usage: sage-notebook [-h] [--log LOG] [--notebook [NOTEBOOK]]
```

```
$ sage -docbuild -h
Usage: sage -docbuild [OPTIONS] DOCUMENT (FORMAT | COMMAND)
```

I also wonder why `-n` is not listed first on the line (compare with `sage -docbuild -h`):

```
  --notebook [NOTEBOOK], -n [NOTEBOOK], -notebook [NOTEBOOK]
```

To me it is an important feature that `sage -ipython notebook` directly lands in the present working directory. And I will be disappointed if `sage -notebook=ipython` does not. What is the opinion of other users about this?

I am sory to say this, but to me if we default to `--notebook-dir=DOT_SAGE/notebooks_ipython` we follow stupidly a bad design choice of the previous notebook.

> The standard IPython notebook command line options work

In any case, should we document in `sage -notebook -h` that the long list of options of `sage -ipython notebook -h` can be used?

Ok I agree. This should be discussed on sage-devel.

I agree with John Palmieri about the doctest coverage in the `graphics_file` class. I think it should be 100% doctested and should not be too long to do so. Other than that, to me the ticket can get a positive review. (Note: I will not have much internet time in the next few days.)
