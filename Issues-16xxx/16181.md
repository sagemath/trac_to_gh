Same for Sym and QSym.

The `get_main_globals` method hasn't been changed since 2011, so I suspect something else is at fault. The attached branch gets rid of the bug, but I don't understand the code at hand and so it is not really merge-ready. Needs_review is to increase visibility.

ad 1: True; that was a habit from pre-git times. Removed.

ad 2: I have changed it now but I'm not 100% sure (what happens if we are doctesting a package?). I don't have time to run all the doctests now...

ad 3: I can't follow this. It is import-less and it stands at the beginning of the file. At least the first of these properties is crucial!
