Same for Sym and QSym.

The `get_main_globals` method hasn't been changed since 2011, so I suspect something else is at fault. The attached branch gets rid of the bug, but I don't understand the code at hand and so it is not really merge-ready. Needs_review is to increase visibility.

<a id='comment:11'></a>From `sage/doctest/forker.py`:

```
                # Make the right set of globals available to doctests
                if basename.startswith("sagenb."):
                    import sage.all_notebook as sage_all

I'm wondering if we should just axe the line with the `__package__` here?
