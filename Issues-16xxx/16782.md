```
(see ticket:19993#comment:10).

Fix this by conversion to arb, computation of zeta there, and conversion back.
(`mpfi` does not seem to have a zeta function).

Thank you for pointing that out; once #16747 is included and there are conversions between CIF and arb, that would certainly be the better option.
