From sage-devel:

```
sage-6.2 build successfully, but perhaps the make doc-clean was not successful

make doc-clean
cd src/doc && make -j4 clean
Deleting generated docs...
rm -rf en/reference/*/sage
rm -rf en/reference/*/sagenb
rm -rf en/reference/sage
rm -rf en/reference/sagenb
rm -rf output
git clean -f -d .
make[1]: git: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [clean] Error 1
make: *** [doc-clean] Error 2


What am I supposed to do?
```

In `src/doc/Makefile` we have:

```make
all:
        @echo "Please build the doc using either 'make doc' from SAGE_ROOT, or"
        @echo "'sage -docbuild all html'. See 'sage -docbuild help' for more informations."
clean:
        @echo "Deleting generated docs..."
        rm -rf en/reference/*/sage
        rm -rf en/reference/*/sagenb
        rm -rf en/reference/sage
        rm -rf en/reference/sagenb
        rm -rf output
        git clean -f -d .
```

and that's called from the top-level `Makefile` (outside a Sage subshell).

Thoughts?

Try to call Sage's `git` if present otherwise?

Just add a dash to the last line?  (What does `git` remove we couldn't by other means?)

Hmmm, but it apparently wasn't in your `PATH` when you were running `make doc-clean`.

I mean removing those (empty?) folders might not be necessary (I don't know), but certainly the `git clean` there isn't a nop.

Depends on what you consider "readable", which IMHO isn't *that* relevant here either.

We can use `rmdir` (which *is* portable) and just (silently) ignore errors on non-empty directories.

Do you mean we should in addition have a "light" version of `make doc-clean` (only removing empty folders) to be run after switching branches for those who don't want to run `make doc-clean` each time but want to be on the "safe side" w.r.t. doc(re)building?

IMHO probably rather Sphinx should get fixed if that's a/the problem.

Not sure whether modifying `builder.py` really belongs to this ticket (as already mentioned).

In any case, deleting folders should IMHO be done *after* option parsing.

IIRC that didn't always work either, but anyway, it's not documented (at least not where it should be), but instead odd errors are raised in case one hasn't (re)built the inventory prior to trying to build the reference manual.

IMHO at least the `sage --docbuild reference html` error is spot-on, is says that it can't load the inventory.

With my patch there is no need to clean up empty directories from the `doc-clean` target, nor do we do that for any other `*-clean` target.

Well, the difference is *when* a clean-up is made.

I'd expect `make doc-clean` to clean up docs (and doc-related folders).  Just like I expect `make distclean` to clean up immediately, not upon the next attempt to build Sage.

I don't care if it's partially redundant to call `make doc-clean` before actually (re)building docs; it's just triple-safe and shouldn't be too expensive.
