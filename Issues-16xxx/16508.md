This patch adds basic CDGA's. 

They work as follows, first you create the algebra:

```
sage: A.<x,y,t> = CDGAlgebra(QQ, degrees = (1, 1, 2))
sage: A
Graded Commutative Algebra over Rational Field with generators ('x', 'y', 't') in degrees (1, 1, 2)
```

Then define the differential on `A` to construct a differential graded algebra:

```
sage: sage: B = A.CDGAlgebra({x: x*y , y: x*y })
sage: B
Commutative Differential Graded Algebra over Rational Field with generators ('x', 'y', 't') in degrees (1, 1, 2), differential 
    x --> x*y
    y --> x*y
    t --> 0
```

Now you can compute things like a basis of each homogeneous part:

```
sage: B.basis(5)
[y*t^2, x*t^2]
```

Or the cohomology in each degree:

```
sage: B.cohomology(4)
Free module generated by {[t^2]} over Rational Field
sage: B.cohomology(9)
Free module generated by {[-x*t^4 + y*t^4]} over Rational Field
```

Depends on #17224

I think this should be fixed.

Bike-shedding: You sa "commutative graded differential algebra", which I believe is the correct order of adjectives. But then, the class should be called "`CGDAlgebra`", not "`CDGAlgebra`".

I think it is a matter for another ticket. If it is solved in the g-algebra quotents, it should also solve the issue here.

I talked with saraedum about that. My original idea was that, but it had some problems:

1) If the differential is to be defined at creation time, we can not use elements of the parent to determine it, so we should give tuples of dictionaries or something like that. Not user friendly at all.

2) If we set the differential after the object creation, the parent is mutable, which is a problem for pickling, unique representation and so on.

So after considering all, i think that this approach is a decent compromise between user friendlyness  and immutability

Two more comments: "DGA" and "CDGA" are standard in the literature, but so is "differential graded algebra" (as opposed to "graded differential algebra").

Second, it would be very nice (for possible future implementation of spectral sequences) to allow grading by `Z x Z`, or indeed any free abelian group.

SCA is just a function that returns a certain g_algebra quotient.

We already create that kind of quotient here, but with two advantages:

1) We include the degrees in the definition of the g_algebra
2) We allow quotient by arbitrary relations (not just the squares of the odd generators).

<div id="comment:17" align="right">Comment 17</div>

If you look at the code of SCA, it is just a function that:

- 1. Creates a Free Algebra
- 2. Creates a dictionary with the commutatitivty/anticommutativity relations
- 3.Creates the corresponding g-algebra
- 4. Creates the ideal in the g-algebra generated by the squares of the odd generators
- 5. returns the quotient of the g-algebra by the ideal

The result of this last operation is an object of type QuoitientRing_nc_with_category, that basically wraps the corresponding plural object.

Look:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.plural import SCA
sage: A=SCA(QQ,('x','y','z'),[0,1])
sage: type(A)
<class 'sage.rings.quotient_ring.QuotientRing_nc_with_category'>
sage: A.__module__
'sage.rings.quotient_ring'
```

QuotientRing_nc has no references to plural because it is created by passing already plural objects (the g-algebra and the ideal in this case), so it relies on the functionality that they provide.

I think the second is more standard \u2013 for example, the phrase \"graded commutativity\" is commonly used \u2013 and after some thought, that's what I used in the rewrite. (\"Commutative graded algebra\" sounds like a graded algebra that happens to be commutative, implying strict commutativity. In \"graded commutative algebra\", \"graded\" modifies both \"commutative\" and the algebra, so the algebra is graded and the commutativity has a sign coming from the grading. According to Google search, there are about four times as many hits for \"graded commutative algebra\" compared to \"commutative graded algebra\". Similarly for a search on http://mathoverflow.net.)\n\n- On the other hand, \"differential graded algebra\" is completely standard, and so is \"commutative differential graded algebra\".

Maybe that method could use some documentation, though.\n\n2. When initializing a graded commutative algebra, what should we do if neither ``names`` or ``degrees`` is specified (as in `GCAlgebra(QQ)`)? Right now I'm raising an error.\n\n3. `TestSuite` fails on these algebras: \n\n```\nThe following tests failed: _test_elements, _test_pickling\n```\n Is that important?",

Here is a new branch: u/jhpalmieri/DGA_new. (Is there some sort of markup I can give to make that an active link? Should we make it the official branch attached to this ticket?)

This is a complete rewrite based on Miguel's version, and so built on top of `QuotientRing_nc`. Changes:

- I removed all of the category stuff. That can go on a separate ticket (#16513).

- I added the option to multi-grade the objects, using commands like

```
A.<x,y,z> = CDGAlgebra(QQ, degrees=((1,0), (0,1), (2,0)))
```

- Tinkered with documentation. Added the main file to the reference manual.

- Various code modifications and clean up. Among other things:

- Sped up `GCAlgebra.homogeneous_part`. The old version was `GCAlgebra.homogeneous_part`, the new version `GCAlgebra.basis`. In my current code, there is some caching going on, but when doing these timings, I disabled the caching.

- Sped up `_call_` method for `CDGA_Differential`:

```
sage: A.<t,x,y,z> = CDGAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,1,2,4))
sage: B = CDGAlgebra(A, differential={t:y, x:y})
sage: a = t*x*y**20*z**20
sage: timeit('B.differential()._call1_(a)')   # original version
25 loops, best of 3: 19.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit('B.differential()._call3_(a)')   # new version
125 loops, best of 3: 2.38 ms per loop
```

- Rewrote `is_homogeneous` based on other such methods elsewhere in Sage. It's slightly faster this way.

- Should it be "commutative graded algebra" or "graded commutative algebra"? I think the second is more standard – for example, the phrase "graded commutativity" is commonly used – and after some thought, that's what I used in the rewrite. ("Commutative graded algebra" sounds like a graded algebra that happens to be commutative, implying strict commutativity. In "graded commutative algebra", "graded" modifies both "commutative" and the algebra, so the algebra is graded and the commutativity has a sign coming from the grading. According to Google search, there are about four times as many hits for "graded commutative algebra" compared to "commutative graded algebra". Similarly for a search on http://mathoverflow.net.)

- On the other hand, "differential graded algebra" is completely standard, and so is "commutative differential graded algebra". So the adjectives are not ordered consistently in the different types of algebras.

- So the main classes and functions are `GCAlgebra` and `CDGAlgebra`. The second of these is the only thing imported at the top-level.

Comments and questions:

1. `GCAlgebra._element_constructor_` works unexpectedly: if B and C are quotients of A, then you can convert elements of B to elements of C. For example:

```
sage: A.<x,y,z> = CDGAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1, 2, 1))
sage: B = A.quotient(A.ideal(z))
sage: C = A.quotient(A.ideal(x*y))
sage: C.inject_variables()
Defining x, y, z
sage: x*y
0
sage: B(x*y)
0
sage: B(x)*B(y)
x*y
```
 However, it looks like this is just a slightly modified version of the same method from `rings/quotient_ring.py`, so maybe we should leave it as is. Maybe that method could use some documentation, though.

2. When initializing a graded commutative algebra, what should we do if neither ``names`` or ``degrees`` is specified (as in `GCAlgebra(QQ)`)? Right now I'm raising an error.

3. `TestSuite` fails on these algebras: 

```
The following tests failed: _test_elements, _test_pickling
```
 Is that important?

Thanks for the work. I will leave on holidays tomorrow, so don't know when i will have time to look at it.

Just a few quick comments:

About the names... it seems to be several choices in the literature. I am ok with any of them. 

About the filing tests, as i mentioned before, is a problem that comes inherited from g-algebra quotients. It should be fixed in a different ticket.

About the conversion between different quotients, i think it is ok. It is a conversion, not a coercion, so we can be much less strict. I think it makes sense to convert between parents with the same kind of structure and generators with the same names.

About initializing without names and degrees, i think raising an error is the right thing to do. It is what happens if, for instance, you try to create a polynomial ring without the names of the generators.

@jhpalmieri Easiest thing is to just change the branch since that is the current (most?) working version. Worst case we just change the branch back.

I'm fine with this not depending on #16513. When I see Nicolas in 2 weeks, we'll work more on the category side of things. Plus if there is an actual implementation, it will make doing the doctesting much easier.

So i guess that means that we cannot write a method to compute the cohomology algebra of a cdga. Unless there is some algorithm that can compute it in some cases. Or that we somehow implement infinitely generated cdga's.

Possibly in positive characteristic, and in general, we can compute the cohomology algebra through a range of degrees. That might be worthwhile.

<div id="comment:42" align="right">Comment 42</div>

Okay here's my first big pass of review. I've reworked a bunch of things:

- Differentials are linear, so they are in the category of modules morphisms.
- Differentials now are endomorphisms of a `CGAlgebra`.
- Implemented coercions between `GCAlgebra` and `CDGAlgebra`.
- Added `TestSuite` checks (which led to #17224).
- I put the `over {base_ring}` last for `CGAlgebra` to better follow the rest of Sage.
- Cleaned up the doc.

There will be more changes and improvements coming, but I figured I should post what I have currently. In particular, I'm going to tweaks things around so that the differential specified for `CDGAlgebra` acts naturally on its elements rather than using the coercions. I'm also going to implement a method to create a differential morphism, in case someone has a use for that independently.

Actually, that makes me ask this question. Should we put all of the chain complex implementations in the differentials? If so, should we have (decorator) class of `CDGAlgebra` call those functions (which would mainly be a shorthand) or remove that class all together?

From my point of view, doing `B=A.CDGAlgebra(...)` and then manipulating `B` feels like the natural thing: I view the differential graded algebra as the central object of study here. Doing instead `d=A.differential(...)` and then manipulating `d` would not be the obvious thing to do at all.
