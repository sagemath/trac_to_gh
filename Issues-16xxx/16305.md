When the environment variable `MPLCONFIGDIR` is set by `sage-env`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` has not been set to the correct value yet.  This can cause the setting of `MPLCONFIGDIR` to fail; see [#15901 comment:17](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/15901#comment:17) and follow-up comments.  We should move this part of `sage-env` further down.
