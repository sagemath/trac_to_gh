I'm talking about this here: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/doctesting.html

I am pretty sure that `./sage -tp 10 --long src/` should be replaced by `./sage -tp 10 --long --all`. And even that might not be the right thing since we are using git:

```
sage -t src/sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py.BACKUP.3033.py  # 177 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py.BASE.3033.py  # 176 doctests failed
sage -t src/sage/algebras/clifford_algebra.py.REMOTE.3033.py  # 177 doctests failed
```

(I am not in the middle of a merge; these files have been left behind by git mergetool / meld.)

Recently I was surprised by @vbraun who showed me failing doctests even though I had done a `./sage -tp --long src/sage`. Solution: he tested in `src/doc` too!

<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Right; this (from `sage/doctest/control.py`) is probably the correct procedure:

```
        if self.options.all:
            self.log("Doctesting entire Sage library.")
            from glob import glob
            self.files.append(opj(SAGE_SRC, 'sage'))
            self.files.append(opj(SAGE_SRC, 'doc', 'common'))
            self.files.extend(glob(opj(SAGE_SRC, 'doc', '[a-z][a-z]')))
            self.options.sagenb = True
```
But one definitely shouldn't be doctesting the src/build hierarchy...

The right solution is probably `./sage -tp 10 --long --all` or `make ptestlong`.
