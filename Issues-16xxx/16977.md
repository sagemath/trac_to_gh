In sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx lines 66-70 there is a conversion from Sage integers to NTL ZZs, as used in eclib, which goes via Python ints.  This causes some problems on 32-bit machines, which few people still use but which causes doctest problems, in that file and also in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate where this interface is used.

See #16959 for some discussion on this.  It should not be hard to fix, as this conversion is already implemented in sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.pyx, but will need testing on both 32- and 64-bit machines.

I had to check the code in eclib for this, and the answer seems to be "yes".  The C++ test program for this functionality minimises the input curve.  If not minimal then it is likely that the incorrect Hecke eigenvalue for non-minimal primes will be used, with the result that the modular symbol eigenspace will not be found correctly.

My C++ code documentation has improved since I started contributng to Sage but is still not perfect!

Thanks, but I already checked your wonderful database and found `21758k3`, which is the smallest example where a coefficient is larger than `2^60` (the coefficient has 65 bits in fact).

> Thanks, but I already checked your wonderful database and found `21758k3`, which is the smallest example where a coefficient is larger than `2^60` (the coefficient has 65 bits in fact).

:) I know, my loop found that one first as well, but I went back since that curve is not "optimal" (last part of label > 1) and people normally only ask for the modular symbol map on optimal curves (though they are certainly allowed to ask for any curve and should get a reasonable answer...).  The first time I used "for E in cremona_curves()" and the I used "for E in cremona_optimal_curves()".
