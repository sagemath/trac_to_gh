I merged #18546 and #19063 as these tickets have been closed.

There is the following problem: #19063 uses the `experimental` decorator on `ComplexBallField.__init__`. On the other hand, `CBF` is defined in that module, which calls the constructor of `ComplexBallField`.

Here, in `matrix.py` I need to import `ComplexBallField` in order to check whether the ring is a complex ball field. This immediately triggers the `experimental` warning even if no `ComplexBallField` is constructed explicitly, because `CBF` is constructed.

I see four options:
1. remove the `experimental` warning in `ComplexBallField` now.
2. remove the `experimental` warning in `ComplexBallField` once #19152 is merged
3. move `CBF = ComplexBallField()` to a separate module, e.g. `sage.rings.complex_ball_acb_default` and replace all lines `from sage.rings.complex_ball_acb import CBF` by `from sage.rings.complex_ball_acb_default import CBF` and undo this change once the `experimental` warning disappears
4. fix doctests in 252 other modules whenever a matrix is constructed which falls back to the generic implementation.

Suggestions?

Hello,

So I had a look and added a few reviewer patches with minor changes. Two questions:
- are the functions `matrix_to_acb_mat` & co really useful?
- your `__init__` deviates a little bit from the logic in `Matrix_generic_dense.__init__`, so that for example the following no longer works, is that intentional?

```
sage: Pol.<x> = QQ[]
sage: pol = 1 + x + x^2
sage: Mat = MatrixSpace(CBF, 3, 1)
sage: Mat(pol)
[1.000000000000000]
[1.000000000000000]

Thank you. I added one more minor commit on top of it (changing the title in the documentation for consistency with `real_arb` and `complex_arb`.

> Two questions:

I use them in #17222: there, the time critical part does not use the full coercion model, but just a C array of `acb_mat_t`. Thus it is convenient there to be able to convert a matrix of `CIF`s to an `acb_mat_t` directly instead of having it converted by a call to `matrix(CBF, ...)` and then copying the resulting `acb_mat_t`. The same in the converse direction.

I see three options:
- keeping it the way it is now
- removing these functions here and doing (minimal) overhead in #17222 when initializing the computations there by calling `matrix(CBF, ...)`
- rewriting #17222 to use complex balls instead of complex intervals throughout (that was not an option in October 2014 when I wrote that code, because complex balls were not yet really implemented).

This is a consequence of following advice on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/kZX_Rh_V5vE/uSH6-sTpP0wJ). Indeed, 

```
sage: Pol.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: pol = 1 + x + x^2
sage: Mat = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3, 1)
sage: Mat(pol)
[1.000000000000000]
[1.000000000000000]
[1.000000000000000]
```
does not work, either. BTW, most but not all of the cython oddities you fixed in your commits here have been fixed in the integer matrices in the meantime, however, the `for i from 0 <= i < self._nrows` are still there.

(It doesn't really matter, but I'm not sure I understand what you are saying: why do you need to copy the `acb_mat_t`?)

I'd say this is a weakness of the implementation over the integers, and it would be better to be compatible with the generic case. What do you think? BTW, changing it also would make it possible to call `Matrix_complex_ball_dense` directly to convert a matrix over `CIF` to one over `CBF`, reducing the overhead you were worrying about a little.

And one more thing I missed on first reading: I don't understand the part that says “`copy` - ignored (since complex balls are immutable)” in the docstring of `__init__`. Based on the code and documentation of `MatrixSpace.matrix()`, it seems to me that this parameter is supposed to control whether the matrix itself—not its entries—is copied.

I have a `acb_mat_t[10]`. In order to fill that array, I have to copy from Sage objects.

> I'd say this is a weakness of the implementation over the integers, and it would be better to be compatible with the generic case. What do you think? BTW, changing it also would make it possible to call `Matrix_complex_ball_dense` directly to convert a matrix over `CIF` to one over `CBF`, reducing the overhead you were worrying about a little.


fixed. Do you want to open a ticket for integer matrices?

> And one more thing I missed on first reading: I don't understand the part that says “`copy` - ignored (since complex balls are immutable)” in the docstring of `__init__`. Based on the code and documentation of `MatrixSpace.matrix()`, it seems to me that this parameter is supposed to control whether the matrix itself—not its entries—is copied.


I do not know how to implement `copy=False`. I do not think that it can be done as in `matrix_generic_dense` because we have a somewhat specialized data structure here. Thus I still ignore `copy`, but tried to rewrite the documentation.
