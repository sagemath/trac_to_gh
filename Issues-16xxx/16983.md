```
For prime finite fields, we should support a custom modulus (internally in Sage, we don't need to use this modulus in the backend):

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(7))
sage: k = GF(7, modulus=x+5)
sage: k.modulus()
x + 6
sage: k.gen()
1
```

We should also make the modulus monic:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(7))
sage: k.<a> = GF(7^2, modulus=2*x^2-3, impl="pari_ffelt")
sage: k.modulus()
2*x^2 + 4
```
(the Givaro backend does this implicitly)

The patch does the above, with lots of cleaning up.
