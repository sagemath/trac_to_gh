k100*k101*w112 + k100*k102*k110 + k100*k102*w102 + k100*k103*w111 + ...

sage: gb = F.groebner_basis(algorithm='magma') # new: this used to fail

This obviously needs to be merged with the latest development version.

Apart from that, this ticket seems to do a lot of things (not only fixing several independent bugs, but also refactoring code), so it could be seen as a patch bomb which is a bad thing. Since this patch touches Magma-related stuff, only people who have Magma could review this.

First remark:

in the commit	1b7927cb54bb2943ad2ae1a43c8e3befdf6703b6
in file src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py
at line 4139 I think it should be 
`if d >= 0` instead of `if d > 0`

Second remark:

in the commit 	fffdbe0c8f9a248b3436d9c846bcd7b04a036d88
you introduce option terms=True to choose maximum number of terms.
I don't like it, because the option is not self-descriptive,
but try to convince me.

Third remark: 
in 	81c951fa9d428816a44dd8855d5a00ec4c3cf2b3

you change the default option 'choose_degree=False' 
Changing default options is dangerous since it may break
existing code. Please give reasons why this change is still ok

commits

        37fb67cce683927cd248b518602e81a2e33ac134

looks ok for me

I will continue the review tomorrow evening.

Ok, here the missing review comments:

##############################################################################
1.
"make sure we use the polynomial ring as ring not the monoid", in
file `./src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py`


I think there is a failing example, if the input below is legal:

```
R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
I = Ideal(5000*x*R,y*x+5) #error
# Ring is Monoid of ideals of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field =>error:
# R must be a commutative ring
```

update: something is fishy with the next failing example:
a. what was K ?
b. how to reproduce "not a constant polynomial" error



second failing example (different error):

```
R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
I = Ideal(5000*x*K+y*x,y*x+5) 
# TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

in  commit  [9ee750ef52d6d6ba43254a07ffbf9cea1160315f](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=9ee750ef52d6d6ba43254a07ffbf9cea1160315f&id=9ee750ef52d6d6ba43254a07ffbf9cea1160315f)
snippet:

```
+ try:
+ c = K.characteristic()
+ except NotImplementedError:
+ c = 0
```

Why is c set to zero?  At least this should be documented. 
Is it not possible to have a different characteristic in case of an NotImplementedError? Do you have an example which hits this issue?

####################################################################

refactored (lib)Singular GB code,
in commit    [e60f83a9e1584a899e8c79171ce177474b9fed06](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=6e9ef02bae16c9ec564b901d2a573bcb8f65ee6d&id=e60f83a9e1584a899e8c79171ce177474b9fed06)
in src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular.pyx ,
line 114, ff.`sage_ideal_to_singular_ideal`
Is there a corresponding test for a conversion from "`or a list of generators`"? 
If not, could you add one?

Same commit, 
in file 'src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py
renaming `singular_default` to `singular`; why? 
At other places there are singular_default usages.
Is there a difference?

####################################################################
4.
Same commit,
It seems that reduce examples show no examples for explicitly reducing leading coefficient,
Could you add an example or a test which hits "`ret.append(f.lc()**(-1)*f)`"?

####################################################################
5.
Sequence has no 'reduced' function
Is that ok?
Example:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
F = Sequence([x,x+1])
F.reduced() # fails
```

(fix Magma interface broken when moving decorators around):

Could you explain what may get wrong and add an example?

I agree, so I changed it. I changed the `True` to `Infinity` and changed the behaviour such that when requesting more terms than exist the number is silently reduced to the maximum number of available terms: `563baf0`

PS: Because I am stupid, though, I rebased instead of merged. Hence, I believe you'll have to check out the code again, i.e. you can't just git pull again in your current branch. Sorry for that!

It changes the behaviour of a random sampler so the output is not deterministic anyway. Also, ``choose_degree=True``does not return what I’d expect from a random sampler: something uniform if possible. Mod p the new default lives up to this expectation if we consider uniform to mean: uniform of a given degree.

sage: I = Ideal(5000*x*R,y*x+5) #error
# Ring is Monoid of ideals of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field =>error:
# R must be a commutative ring
```

I don’t think this is connected. I’m getting the same error with sage 6.4.1. Also, The business of monoid vs ring only occurs when PolyBoRi implements the ring.

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = Ideal(5000*x*K+y*x,y*x+5) 
# TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

See above.

I added a comment:

# We assume that our ring has characteristic zero if it does not implement a
# characteristic(). For example, generic quotient rings do not have a characteristic()
# method implemented. It is okay to set c = 0 here because we're only using the
# characteristic to pick a more specialized implementation for c = 2.

I added a test.

There is no need to rename singular to singular_default so I dropped it. It makes no difference either way.

> It seems that reduce examples show no examples for explicitly reducing leading
> coefficient, Could you add an example or a test which hits
> "ret.append(f.lc()**(-1)*f)"?


I added one.

> Sequence has no 'reduced' function Is that ok? Example:


I think this is fine as Sequence is not only for polynomials but for anything. However, reduced() only seems to make sense for polynomials.

Unfortunately, I forgot. I could investigate if you insist.

the failure was likely related to incremental docbuild (I didn' keep the error message)

Running 'make doc-clean' first did the trick ( the docbuild succeeds with warnings)

1. Can you confirm that './sage --nodotsage --docbuild all pdf' succeeds`?

2. Did I forget to review some other important aspects ? I must admit that there is a hint in the review checklist http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/trac.html?highlight=review to test if the reference manual builds or not.
