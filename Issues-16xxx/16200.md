Currently, state labels are not typeset in LaTeX's math mode, but transition labels are.
Furthermore, the default behaviour is to pipe the label through latex(), which by definition
produces output suitable for math mode. Therefore, I consider this to be a bug and change the behaviour.

This is an incompatible change; however, relying on the old behaviour will either make no difference (if the label was an integer or a string (this is protected by \text anyway)) or lead to an error
when typesetting with tikz.

While doing that, I also include a space after the comma in the coordinate tuples (PEP 8 probably does not apply to TeX code included in a docstring, but nevertheless ...).
