The purpose of this ticket is to complement the static documentation
of a category by an autogenerated overview of it including:

- a description of the category taken from its docstring (if there is one)

- the list of the important super categories (e.g. the result of
  `super_structure_categories` of #16340)

- the list of the axioms

- the list of all the methods on parents, elements, ..., including the
  `_test_*`, `_*_` and `__**__` methods. For each method, there would
  be a short description (taken from the docstring), and information
  on where the method is defined (e.g. as an abstract method) and
  implemented.

- ???

This feature would be particularly useful for categories with axioms
or functorial construction categories since in most case this would
provide complete information without having to write any static
documentation.

Possible user interface to access the documentation

- Make it available with `C?`; this would require some magic to
  automagically replace the static documentation

- Add an `explain_category` method

- Use IPython's `%pinfo/%pinfo2/help` infrastructure
