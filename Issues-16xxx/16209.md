This function takes a seed for a cluster algebra of finite type with principal coefficients and returns an orientation of its exchange graph that has the structure of a poset. It returns this orientation of the exchange graph as a poset object and as a quiver object.

I have made a working and documented branch from the given file. I am not convinced at all that this is the proper way to do it. Computing first the mutation class and then doing it again looks bad enough.

Thanks Frederic.

Alexander's goal was to have a working version first.  Then we would streamline it together.  Your suggestion to make sure we don't compute the mutation class twice is an apt one.  We will be updating this in the next few weeks (busy with other projects at the moment).
