<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Travis,

To fix the B2 calculation (and to be, as you say, more robust), changing the code like the below example sounds like a good idea.

```
sage: B = CrystalOfTableaux(['B',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: R.<q> = QQ[]
sage: ret = R.zero()
sage: for b in B:
....:    ret += q**len(b.to_highest_weight()[1])
....:
sage: ret
q^10 + 2*q^9 + 3*q^8 + 4*q^7 + 5*q^6 + 5*q^5 + 5*q^4 + 4*q^3 + 3*q^2 + 2*q + 1
```

Also, would it be a good idea to have this ticked based on #15882?
