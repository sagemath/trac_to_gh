There is a missing `[:k]` in the code, and Sage returns a `OA(6,12)` even when only `OA(4,12)` is requested. Well, it TRIES to return it, as nothing is returned by this function without being checked first `:-P`

Before

```
sage: OA = designs.orthogonal_array(4,12)
...
AssertionError: 
```

After

```
sage: OA = designs.orthogonal_array(4,12)
sage: 
```
