Yay, I made someone's head hurt!

Seriously, I was baffled - and why does it hurt pip install but not others? - but at any rate this works *and* (crucially) is already in upstream, so as long as it doesn't give us any surprises I figure we should be okay.  (For instance, someone might want to make sure that a few figures actually plot correctly with this.)
