This ticket is used for doctesting the Python 3 compatibility of range(). It is not a real ticket and should not be merged.

Python 3 preparation: "xrange()" is gone and "range()" becomes an iterator

The tool 2to3 renames `xrange()` to `range()` and wraps existing `range()` usages with `list()`.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 293 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Depends on #16457

Component: **python3**
