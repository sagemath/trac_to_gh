In #16281 we open the room for implementation of [non-Desarguesian projective plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Desarguesian_plane). In order to do so, we need to implement the underlying [near-field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_%28mathematics%29)... and this is the content of that ticket.
