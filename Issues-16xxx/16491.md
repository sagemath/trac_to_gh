This is a follow up to #16439.

1. The functions `atan, acos, asin` give `TypeError` on Python `complex` input.

2. The output of trigonometric functions are inconsistent depending on whether `complex` or `CDF` or `CC` is used as the input type.

From #16439 discussion by @kcrisman:

Just one point - almost certainly some of those digits are 'extra' from Python. Compare (after this):

```
sage: sec(1.+i)
0.498337030555187 + 0.591083841721045*I
sage: sec(complex(1,1))
(0.49833703055518686+0.5910838417210451j)
sage: sec(CDF(complex(1,1)))
0.498337030555 + 0.591083841721*I
```
Interesting.

Here is something else I don't know what to do with.

```
sage: arccot(1.+i)
arccot(1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I)  # in SR
sage: cot(1.+i)
0.217621561854403 - 0.868014142895925*I
```
One would think this should be the same type of output.

That said, SR is useful for some other cases of exact input.

I'm wondering whether we want to try to fix all of this here, though.
