As the title says.

Because this method also needs to shorten a matrix in the middle of `OA_from_Vmt`, it is split into `QDM_from_Vmt` and `OA_from_quasi_difference_matrix` (which was already called).

Hey Nathann,

In `OA_14_124`, it is not safe to ask for a finite field of size 2<sup>5</sup> and hope that, by chance, its generator satisfies `w^5 + w^2 + 1 = 0`. You would rather give the constructor an explicit polynomial:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2),'x')
sage: x = R.gen()
sage: GF(2**5, 'w', modulus=x**5+x**2+1)
Finite Field in w of size 2^5
```

and I got a docbuild error

```
OSError: [combinat ] None:5: WARNING: citation not found: BvR514
```

Yo !

Yeah... And "by chance" it always works ?

Given that you are the one to complain about this, I will use the first's trick against you : `conway=True` `:-P`

Ahahahah. I must have replaced 82 with 514 at some point `:-D`

I had also "made a small mistake" in the implementation. I had forgotten to set some flag from "False" to "True", which means that the new OA have a longer width. I didn't like to notice that I had implemented so many new OA and that they did not even reach the Handbook's bound.... Now all is good `:-P`

I also added an OA for 640, freshly debugged.

Hi Nathann,

I simplified the helper function at u/vdelecroix/16604 and update the branch over 6.3.rc1.

I would be really happy if:
- the helper function would return a quasi-difference matrix instead
- it was a function (not a hidden one) with explanations. I was able to simplify the function reading line by line but I do not understand anything. Do you have at least references for the construction?

(I can handle the merge with your documentation ticket #16766)

I made it a private function exactly because I have no idea how to write a proper documentation for it. It is just a kind of construction that Julian R. Abel uses for many OA, and as I found I had been doing copy/pastes for it many many times I figured out that it would be better to simplify the code by making it one function.

It is not an explanation... I would like something like "If A and Y are matrices of size XX and properties YY then applying construction ZZ you obtain a quasi-difference matrix".

to change your last two commits I would do that :

1) git reset HEAD~1 # this "cancels" your last commit, and its code will become "staged differences". As if you had not typed "git commit"

2) git commit --amend --author <whatever you want> # change the author of the merge commit

3) git commit -a --author <whatever you want> # do your last commit again

Yooooooooo !

I just read your new version of the code. Thanks, it's much better than this ! I will add a small commit for a sentence I had some trouble understanding at first.

And if you do not mind I will also reverse your `2**n-->1<<n`. That's zero improvement on speed for less redability.

Hi again,

I read the Abel-Cheng paper of 1994 (written during Julian Abel's thesis I guess) where the explanation was clear enough to write a complete documentation. The function has moved to orthogonal_array.py...

Please read three times the documentation to see whether its readable and understandable. You can also complain about the ugly name I choose, but in that case find something better.

Vincent

PS: there are two mysteries that I will ask Julian about
- it is not clear to me why we need w<sup>c</sup> = w + 1
- we do not care very much of the fact that the part different from `2^c` is a prime number

Well. Did you read it  three times yourself ? `:-P`

- Most of the function's one line description defines what n is, and at this level we do not care much. What about `Returns an OA(k,|G_1|2^c) from a constrained (G_1,k-1,2)-difference matrix` ? It is a bit more meaningful and also indicates that the function's input is not as simple as a pair of integers...

- Why `G_1` and not `G` ?

- Shouldn't we use `F_p` rather than `GF(2)` in the doc ?

- `that belong t`

- B and C : why not name them `A_{G_1}` and `A_{GF(2)} ` ?

- <code>For any pair \`i\` and \`j\` of distinct integers in \`{1,...,k-1}\` and \`g\` an element of \`G_1\`</code> --> `for any i\neq j and g\in G_1` ?

- `C_{i,k_1} - C_{i,k_1}` is zero `:-P`

- the array whose rowS

About the function's name here's my attempt: `OA_p_times_2_pow_c_from_matrix` ? With your name one can believe that it is just about powers of two. And the "from matrix" indicated that "if you are looking for something standard, pass your way".

Hello,

Thanks for your careful reading.
 
> > Please read three times the documentation to see whether its readable and understandable. You can also complain about the ugly name I choose, but in that case find something better.

> 
> Well. Did you read it  three times yourself ? `:-P`


No. I wrote it three times ;-?

> - Most of the function's one line description defines what n is, and at this level we do not care much. What about `Returns an OA(k,|G_1|2^c) from a constrained (G_1,k-1,2)-difference matrix` ? It is a bit more meaningful and also indicates that the function's input is not as simple as a pair of integers...


done

> - Why `G_1` and not `G` ?


Because G was the cartesian product. Now changed.

> - Shouldn't we use `F_p` rather than `GF(2)` in the doc ?


You meant `F_2`? And then use `F_{2^c}` for `GF(2^c)`. In non compiled version of the doc I found my version more readable. Moreover, it conincides with what you use in Sage to get your finite field. And it is pretty much standard ([wikipedia entry for GF(2)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF%282%29)).

> - `that belong t`


t -> to (done)

> - B and C : why not name them `A_{G_1}` and `A_{GF(2)} ` ?


B and C is the notation from Abel-Cheng 1994. And it is much shorter when you have to write `B_{i,k_1}` instead of `(A_{GF(2)})_{i,k_1}`.

> - <code>For any pair \`i\` and \`j\` of distinct integers in \`{1,...,k-1}\` and \`g\` an element of \`G_1\`</code> --> `for any i\neq j and g\in G_1` ?


done

> - `C_{i,k_1} - C_{i,k_1}` is zero `:-P`


you are right! It is now `C_{i,k_1} - C_{j,k_1}`.

> - the array whose rowS


done

> About the function's name here's my attempt: `OA_p_times_2_pow_c_from_matrix` ? With your name one can believe that it is just about powers of two. And the "from matrix" indicated that "if you are looking for something standard, pass your way".


As I mentioned it is not `p_times_2_pow_c` but `n_times_2_pow_c`. `G` needs not be a cyclic group of prime order. Changed for `OA_n_times_2_pow_c_from_matrix`.

Helloooooooooo !!

Thanks for your modifications. I added a small commit to fix a couple of things 

* add the function in the new index

* Move the explanation on how elements of `GF(2^c)` should be encoded to the input section

I also tried to rephrase the last sentence of the explanation but I still don't get it. I replaced an occurrence of `G_1` with `G` (and I think that was not a mistake), plus I changed the bound `1<=i<= |G|` to `1<= i <= 2|G|`, and now it seems that you indexed `Y` with `i,j` while it should be indexed on `k`. Especially since now that `i` goes to `2|G|` the vector `Y` has the wrong length. Plus you define `Y` as being of length `k-1`. Could you check that again ?

You also defined `k` as ranging from `1` to `k-1` which was a bit hard to read, so I "found a way around".

Tell me what you think !

Hi,

I was a bit stupid: there is a `k` in the parameter but I used it as a variable... so it is definitely confusing. Moreover in the Abel-Cheng articles they use transposed matrix so I was confused with rows and columns. I will add a commit about that in a minute.

Yo !

We don't have `is_difference_matrix` ? `O_o`

Okay then I will write this today. You may like difference families but I like difference matrices.

We need a `is_difference_matrix`. Then we'll finish this ticket.
