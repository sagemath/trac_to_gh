Depending on the type fo the ring (Singular vs polydict) the return of degree differs.

```
sage: R1.<x,y>=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x,y',order=TermOrder('wdeglex',(2,3)))
sage: (x+y).degree()
3
sage: R2.<u,v>=PolynomialRing(QQ['t'],'x,y',order=TermOrder('wdeglex',(2,3)))
sage: (u+v).degree()
1
```

Keywords: weighted degree
