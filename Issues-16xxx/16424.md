```
The name implies a boolean return value (contrary to the implementation), and used that way the function is way too slow:

```
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_square(8*(n)+1)]')
625 loops, best of 3: 909 µs per loop
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_triangular_number(n)]')
5 loops, best of 3: 200 ms per loop
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_square(8*(n)+1)]')
625 loops, best of 3: 903 µs per loop
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_triangular_number(n)]')
5 loops, best of 3: 195 ms per loop
```
The reason is that the simple boolean test used above is not performed before the more involved computation of the index.

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Now it's only 10x slower:

```
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_triangular_number(n)]')
25 loops, best of 3: 10.6 ms per loop
sage: timeit('l=[n for n in range(1000) if is_triangular_number(n)]')
25 loops, best of 3: 10.1 ms per loop
```
but that is because the function does more than it should, judging from the name.

Hi Ralf,

see my branch at public/16424

I rewrote the function as it can be done in a much cleaner/faster way. Moreover, a function called `is_X` must return a boolean. It makes no sense to have it return boolean or integer values. I decided to add an extra argument `return_value` that does the job. I also rewrite the doc which was very ugly.

Tell me what you think...

Anyway, I am not sure it is worth it to have a function which is just equivalent to

```
is_triangular = lambda n: (8*n+1).is_square()
```

Vincent

Hi Vincent, the branch is fine. I would agree that the function is not worth occupying one of the precious global slots. However, I think it is still good to have, so you can set positive if you also remove it from `quadratic_forms/all.py`.

I have no problem removing it from the global namespace but then how the user would find it? The path is really unguessable!

```
sage: from sage.quadratic_forms.extra import is_triangular_number
```
