With this branch, one can see the product of two fields (or the product of one field and an additive group) as an additive group.

```
sage: F8=GF(8,'x') 
sage: x = F8.primitive_element()
sage: F5=GF(5)
sage: F8xF5 = F8.cartesian_product(F5)
sage: F8xF5.an_element()
(0, 0)
sage: e=F8xF5((x,4))    
sage: e
(x, 4)
sage: e+e
(0, 3)
sage: 3*e
(x, 2)
sage: -e
(x, 1)
```

Hmm, do you mean to construct the Cartesian product of fields? Then it will be a ring, with two operations, addition and multiplication...

Hmmmm.. Well, I guess it may not be very hard to do. 

1) A ring is a additive group (so the + is already implemented) for the product of rings

2) It has a multiplicative operation, but perhaps the product of multiplicative associative magma is not detected as such. If you can just give Sage the right inheritances, perhaps you have no real code to implement.

Good luck,

Your `_element_constructor_` is buggy

```
sage: S1 = FiniteEnumeratedSet(['a','b','c'])
sage: S2 = GF(5)
sage: C=cartesian_product([S1,S2])
sage: C(('a',1))
('a', 1)
sage: c = C(('a',1))
sage: c[1].parent()
Integer Ring
```
It would be better to clean the input of the cartesian product set by set.

I'd say: don't worry about the Rings thing for now unless you critically need it. It will be a one line to add once #10963 is in. Just handle the additive and multiplicative side separately.

I'll have a look at this later today.

You can make any abelian group into a ring by defining multiplication by a non-zero element a to be identity operation, i.e. ax=x for all x in the group, and by 0 to be zero, i.e. 0x=0 for all x in the group.
This should be easy to implement - no real code, just some abstract nonsense :-)

That is, as soon as you have cartesian product of rings, you have what you need in general...

but why?
Is it because #10963 will take forever to merge, as it has apparently hit some kind of OSS unsolvability barrier? :)
 

> If you can just give Sage the right inheritances, perhaps you have no real code to implement.

If I were a category theorist and a (C)Python guru by training, perhaps it will only take me 5 minutes ;-)

Which is why I lived very hard the last 2 days, during which I tried to implement a ten-lines patch that would have taken any of the so-called "category theorist and a (C)Python guru by training" those 5 minutes. Besides, I don't consider the product of additive group to be such a weird notion that it could be left unimplemented for years `:-P`

But well. Now it is done in this patch. Stuff happens.

Hi!

I have just been through the changes. Overall, it looks good, thanks!

Remaining points:
- CartesianProduct.__iter__ should be in EnumeratedSets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods
- In ``_add_``, ``self.parent(right)`` looks suspicious. Does it even work?
  If the purpose is to convert ``right`` into the same parent as
  ``self``, then no need to worry about this: ``_add_`` may assume
  that its two arguments belong to the same parent.
- I am uncomfortable with using ``__iter__`` and ``__getitem__`` for
  accessing the components of an element. For certain cartesian
  products (e.g. cartesian products of modules), ``__iter__`` may have
  a different meaning. Please use ``summand_split`` and
  ``summand_projection`` instead.
- In ``_element_constructor_``: given the catch, if we feed completely
  unrelated crap to the constructor, is there an exception raised as
  one could desire?

```
    sage: GF(3)("a")
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    ...
    TypeError: unable to convert x (=a) to an integer

    sage: C = cartesian_product([GF(3), GF(3)])
    sage: C(["a","b"])
    ???
```


Please add this doctest. Btw, one might also want to raise a meaningful error if the length of `x` is incorrect.

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

Okay, so here I am stuck and I can't sort this out. Here is the problem :

```
sage: FiniteEnumeratedSet(["a","b","c"])("a")
TypeError: Cannot convert str to sage.structure.element.Element
sage: FiniteEnumeratedSet(["a","b","c"])("d")
ValueError: d not in {'a', 'b', 'c'}
```

Because you cannot trust `FiniteEnumeratedSet` to have a sound `__call__` method, I need this try/catch.

On the other hand, if I have this try/catch, then I cannot detect `GF(3)("e")` anymore. So what do we do ?

I personally see no problem in removing this catch, knowing that cartesian products of `FiniteEnumeratedSet` will fail. For me it is because of a bug in `FiniteEnumeratedSet`, not of what I implement.

I agree.

If this special situation is not used too much elsewhere (i.e. if all
test pass), then I'd say let's go. And if not, I guess we will need to
fix/workaround the problem in FiniteEnumeratedSet.

For others: the answer was that I should just use the `.summand_projection` commands in the code and not iter on the elements for it could have a different meaning elsewhere.

I asked you how to guess the length of the vector though... Which I will need to call the projection commands.

Wow. Thanks.

Ahem. I don't know what happened to the old Nicolas, but I like this version of yourself `:-P`

Thanks for your help. I am testing that only the bug produced by the `FiniteEnumeratedSet` remains in my branch, and all your other remarks should be implemented. I also added an exception (and a test) for the case where the element given to `_element_constructor_` has the wrong length.

Nathann

P.S. : Okay, the tests are done. It passes all tests in category/ and sets/ except for the category/cartesian_product.py file. The problem is the `.an_element()` call at the top of the file.

If it comes to that, we could even overwrite `FiniteEnumeratedSet.CartesianProduct.ParentMethod._element_constructor_`. Gosh. I almost speak the category slang, now. I am scared.

:-)

Well, currently no teaching, no big ongoing administrative task, and
before #10963 is in, I am stuck for long term dev. But don't worry,
it's the same me: in the mean time others are cursing me (loud or
quietly) for not working on other stuff ... Sight, that's never ending ...

> Thanks for your help. I am testing that only the bug produced by the `FiniteEnumeratedSet` remains in my branch, and all your other remarks should be implemented. I also added an exception (and a test) for the case where the element given to `_element_constructor_` has the wrong length.


Sounds good. I'll check that tomorrow.

> Gosh. I almost speak the category slang, now. I am scared.

Good night!

This bypasses the constructor checks while being independent of the internal representation.

Oh, no, it does not bypass the constructor in the basic implementation! `_cartesian_product_of_element` should definitely call element_class directly.

Hi,

I fixed `_cartesian_product_of_elements` to bypass `_element_constructor` and other checks, and documented it. Here is the timing difference:

```
sage: S1 = Sets().example()
sage: S2 = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: C = cartesian_product([S2, S1, S2])
sage: l = tuple([S2.an_element(), S1.an_element(), S2.an_element()])
```
Without the optimization:

```
sage: %timeit C._cartesian_product_of_elements(l)
10000 loops, best of 3: 22 µs per loop
```
With the optimization:

```
sage: %timeit C._cartesian_product_of_elements(lt)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 922 ns per loop
```

If you are fine including this in this ticket, please change the branch to `u/nthiery/16269-optimized`. Otherwise, I'll move this commit to a follow up ticket.

For the record: the tests pass on the cartesian_product.py file. Running all long tests now to be sure.

Cheers,
                                   Nicolas

The optimization is now #16288, as this was more practical for Nathann.
Hence this ticket is ready to be merged as is.
