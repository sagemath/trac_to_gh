My experience is that the last digit in numerics like this can be remarkably sensitive to the OS/CPU/compiler version/phase of the moon.  I once had two Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machines running on the same physical hardware where the last digit differed like this; one had a 32bit kernel and the other a 64bit one, which you wouldn't think would make a difference...

Oh, yes I would. But then I have seen tickets where that happens in the last 6 years.

It is technically harmless it is however a curiosity because the change is sudden. If I had time I would check other versions of scipy to narrow down when the change happened and try to understand why.
