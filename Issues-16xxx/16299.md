Not sure. We are talking about a difference in the 4E-16 which is in the relative tolerance of the function and well within its own tolerance.

But I would have been more ready to accept a difference based on CPU arch rather than OS on similar CPU. 

Looking at scipy the underlying c code hasn't changed since 2008 but higher up tolerance checking has been enforced in 0.14rc2 (scipy/optimize/zeros.py) that's the only thing I can see having an impact.

I did a little testing, and definitely the issue is a result of the scipy upgrade and not the numpy one.  It also shows up on OS X version 10.8 as well.  

My experience is that the last digit in numerics like this can be remarkably sensitive to the OS/CPU/compiler version/phase of the moon.  I once had two Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machines running on the same physical hardware where the last digit differed like this; one had a 32bit kernel and the other a 64bit one, which you wouldn't think would make a difference...

I think this sort of thing is to be expected, and it certainly seems harmless enough in this instance.   So I've changed the status back to "positive review".

Oh, yes I would. But then I have seen tickets where that happens in the last 6 years.

It is technically harmless it is however a curiosity because the change is sudden. If I had time I would check other versions of scipy to narrow down when the change happened and try to understand why.
