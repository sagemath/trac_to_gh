[#13026 comment:15](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/13026#comment:15)

To go triple-safe, touch the autotools-generated files in `spkg-install` after patching.

But as mentioned, patching the autotools *source* files is not even necessary in this case (although it would make sense to submit such a patch upstream, and hopefully remove it (and only this specific one!) upon one of the next upstream upgrades).

I can't follow what otherwise would be off-topic, but that's probably intended.

IMHO all of cddlib is a bad hack. We basically only have it because gfan depends on it.

In any case, this ticket is about making cddlib compile if there is something in `/usr/local`. Suggestions about how to reorganize the patches and still avoid re-running autoconf are off-topic, as you said.

I'm talking about making the spkg even less maintainable (and distro-unfriendly), which is what you currently IMHO do, for no reason.

The issue here btw. popped up again because a previous patch got removed upon the last upgrade.

This is so wrong. Volker's patch is just the minimal work to make it more distro friendly. I would remove the "export"s statements from the the top Makefile.am too.
That particular mistake is usually not too bad for distro preparing binary packages in a sensible way. But it is ugly as hell.

To finish with the comments on distro unfriendliness we fortunately start with upstream adding only the piece we deem necessary. We don't start from the sage spkg unless there is no other sources around :)

I am a bit uncomfortable with the way autotools patches are applied and enforced but I can  accept that. I am more to apply the full autotool solution that could be pushed upstream if they were responsive rather than the quick nice fix proposed by Leif.
So if I have a deciding vote I am going for Volker.

To clarify, I'm not against patching the autotools files, I'm against mixing completely unrelated patches.  Especially if we want to submit *parts of it* upstream.  (And it's easy to make sure they get applied in the correct order if at all relevant.  Same for timestamps if patched files depend on other patched files.)

And I'm sorry to say, but unfortunately Gentoo still isn't the only distro. ;-)

Others prefer to have `patches/fix_upstream_bug_{foo,bar}.patch`, `patches/add_sage_functionality_baz.patch` rather than `patches/modifying_{this,that}_file_for_a_couple_of_reason_you_can_probably_guess.patch`. 

Even for just Sage, the former is by far more easy to maintain.

You have it, just give it positive review if you really feel it's *the right thing*<sup>TM</sup> to do.  Also in the light of #15871.

Although the Debianists should probably speak up, too.

How very unfortunate ;) that's why I have to read rpm .spec files from time to time and even troll debian sources.But that was a long and boring dragging comment - the kind you make in the morning because you are gathering your thoughts.

I guess we would need to invite them next time ;)

In the absence of a nice way to run autoreconf and al. on pristine source (as Gentoo would) it is good enough for me. What we should send upstream and in which form is another discussion.
