This is actually a defect because we leave a result from Maxima undefined:

```
sage: hypergeometric([1],[b],x).simplify_hypergeometric()
(b - 1)*x^(-b + 1)*e^x*gamma_greek(b - 1, x)
sage: gamma_greek
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-18-6e90901bc5cb> in <module>()
----> 1 gamma_greek

NameError: name 'gamma_greek' is not defined
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function#Lower_incomplete_Gamma_function

Mathematica seems to have Gamma[a,z] for upper and Gamma[a,0,z] for lower; Maple seems to have upper Gamma. `gamma_inc` (the upper one in Sage) gets immediately converted to `gamma(a,x)`. The symbolic functions `gamma_inc==incomplete_gamma` are converted and never returned to the user as expression:

```
sage: gamma_inc(x,x,hold=True)
gamma(x, x)
sage: incomplete_gamma(x,x,hold=True)
gamma(x, x)
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: integral(t^(s-1)*e^(-t),t,0,x)
-gamma(s, x) + gamma(s)
```
This ticket should deprecate "incomplete_gamma" and add the symbolic function `gamma_inc_lower`, leaving open the question of the global alias for and the displayed name of `Function_gamma_inc`.

Previous part of description:

---

1. Provide all three "user input interfaces" `gamma_inc`, `incomplete_gamma` and `lower_incomplete_gamma`, and convert the Maxima `gamma_greek` to `-gamma(a, x) + gamma(a)`
2. Provide all three "user input interfaces" `gamma_inc`, `incomplete_gamma` and `lower_incomplete_gamma`, and convert to `gamma(a,x)` and `gamma(a,0,x)`n on output
3. Provide all three "user input interfaces" `gamma_inc`, `incomplete_gamma` and `lower_incomplete_gamma`, and have `incomplete_gamma` and `lower_incomplete_gamma` as result instead of `gamma(...)'
4. Change the user interface completely to `lower_incomplete_gamma` and `upper_incomplete_gamma`
5. Change the user interface completely to `gamma_inc_lower` and `gamma_inc_upper`
6. Change the user interface completely to `gamma(a,x)` and `gamma(a,0,x)`

The reason why `gamma_inc(x,y)` gets output as `gamma(x,y)` is not conversion as I thought but simple naming super in the constructor. It would be just as easy to make that `gamma_inc` and change a few doctests such that then:

```
         sage: f = exp_integral_e(-1,x)
         sage: f.integrate(x)
-        Ei(-x) - gamma(-1, x)
+        Ei(-x) - gamma_inc(-1, x)

             sage: gamma_inc(3,2)
-            gamma(3, 2)
+            gamma_inc(3, 2)

             sage: gamma(3,2)
             gamma_inc(3, 2)

             sage: gamma(x,0)
             gamma(x)

             sage: gamma(x, 0, hold=True)
-            gamma(x, 0)
+            gamma_inc(x, 0)
```
I'm appending the patch that enables this here, so it is preserved.

```
sage: (incomplete_gamma(x,y).diff(x)).simplify()
TypeError: ECL says: Error executing code in Maxima: gamma: wrong number of arguments.
```
The problem probably arises because the function ends up separated from its arguments:

```
sage: incomplete_gamma(x,y).diff(x)
D[0](gamma)(x, y)
```
which might confuse the translator (the behaviour is consistent with just going by strings). The changes here might improve the situation. It's worth checking.

The following of course works because it does NOT primarily look at strings:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import *
sage: maxima_calculus(sr_to_max(incomplete_gamma(x,y).diff(x)))
'diff(gamma_incomplete(x,y),x,1)
```

Cool! so it IS easy. Be sure to also test (I haven't checked the answer is correct, but at least it shouldn't raise an error):

```
sage: (incomplete_gamma(x,x+1).diff(x)).simplify().simplify()
-(x + 1)^(x - 1)*e^(-x - 1) + D[0](gamma)(x, x + 1)
```
to check that both occurrences of `f.name()` have been replaced. I check the rest of that file and didn't find any further suspicious uses of `name` so after this, our maxima interface is probably perfect  :-).

Frédéric, any comments on review, or was this just a drive-by improvement?

Does the following (from the description) now come out better?

```
sage: hypergeometric([1],[b],x).simplify_hypergeometric()
```

Could we add the `gamma(a,0,x)` interface for the lower gamma?  *Should* we?

There should be no problem to support both interfaces, and without code duplication. We already have

```
sage: incomplete_gamma(1,2)
e^(-2)
sage: gamma(1,2)
e^(-2)
sage: gamma(2)

```

Well that's the task for #17722, right. To have many doctests will help a good deal.

Note that even if you review this ticket (please add your real name to the ticket head in case) we would need to wait for Sympy-0.7.7 to be released. But a review of the code and the math would leave only a `make ptestlong` to finish it all.

I left this as "needs work" because of your "Oh that's true, I don't know why that got ditched."

Could you merge this up with master and I'll attempt to review again?

Also, please show me how to run all the relevant tests, please?

I'm surprised sympy hasn't cut a release yet, still.
If I'm counting correctly, it's been eight months since their last release.

There's something not quite right with this branch. I get `gamma_greek` if I use combine().

```
sage: e
gamma(x, y) + gamma_inc_lower(x, y)
sage: e.combine()
gamma(x, y) + gamma_greek(x, y)
sage: e(x=1, y=2)
1
sage: e.combine()(x=1, y=2)
e^(-2) + gamma_greek(1, 2)
```

Cannot confirm your doctest failures (except those where sympy-0.7.7 is needed), nor the combine problem. It looks like you tested with an older Sage the doctests of a newer Sage. 

I have squashed all commits into one, and uploaded a new branch based on Sage-6.8. In this branch the three missing doctests were added as well.

Really, a full test should only be done with sympy-0.7.7 but if you think the rest is fine(?) then the missing long test eventually is done quickly by the patchbot.

I did the full test with sympy-0.7.7, only after I got your new doctests in functions.other passing.

I reproduced the combine-gamma-greek problem with sage -br, which I would think should avoid any version-mismatch issues no?  (Apparently the maxima writer forgot that uppercase gamma is also greek?)

That said, I can't reproduce it anymore after merging your branch and running another sage -br.

Should this not come out as gamma_inc_lower?

```
./sage -br
sage: maxima('gamma_greek(x, y)')
gamma_greek(x,y)
```

I do see that `_sage_` of the same expression yields gamma_inc_lower. I suppose I don't know enough about the coersion going on here. I did try looking in the docs but didn't find anything that helped me understand this particular aspect.

```
sage: maxima('gamma_greek(x, y)')
gamma_greek(x,y)

sage: maxima('gamma_greek(x, y)')._sage_()
gamma_inc_lower(x, y)

sage: maxima('gamma_greek(x, y)').simplify()
simplify(gamma_greek(x,y))

sage: maxima('gamma_greek(x, y)')._sage_().simplify()
gamma_inc_lower(x, y)
```

Random numeric tests accurate. Function plots. One curious difference from `gamma_inc`:


```
sage: gamma_inc_lower(a,x).diff(x)
x^(a - 1)*e^(-x)
sage: gamma_inc(a,x).diff(x)
D[1](gamma)(a, x)
```

Looks good to me. Sympy already updated: any other reason not to merge?
