I have an error in building on OS X 10.7 as well.  It's similar but not identical - see [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/MacAppBuildError.txt).  In particular, it seems to have a slightly better error message about what is wrong.

```
/Users/.../Downloads/sage/src/mac-app/AppController.m:199:13: error: use of undeclared identifier 'NSModalResponse'; did you mean 'NSURLResponse'?
            NSModalResponse resp = [alert runModal];

Looks like [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/eb134581fc1b354948e99e150e6c5fdd63cd9120) is the "problem".  In particular, `NSModalResponse` is ["available in OS X v10.9 and later"](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/NSModalResponse).
