This is critical for patchbot runs.

Frequently patchbot runs fail, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/7acENsAQeXo . It is probable this was introduced with setuptools-2.0.1 because only those runs based on versions >6.1.1 show this behaviour. Also first tests with 2.2b1 are encouraging, so it seems right to open this upgrade ticket.

This upgrade indeed seems to solve the problem; my patchbot failed more than half of the time before and not at all after making the same changes as in this patch.
