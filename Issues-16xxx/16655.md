A resolvable `OA(k,n)` is a `OA(k,n+1)`, and the same holds for TD of course. This patch adds a "resolvable" boolean to the two constructors to get resolvable designs.

For OA, the classes are provided by sorting the blocks appropriately.

For TD, which are now `IncidenceStructure`, the same is not possible as incidence structure sort their blocks. Thuuuuuus I was forced to create a (useful) `is_resolvable` function (expect it to be slow on non-ridiculously-small input) which returns the classes.

This is what turned this a priori straightforward patch into ... my whole morning `:-P`

<a id='comment:10'></a>At `u/vdelecroix/16655`:

1) There was a check that the sum of degrees is a multiple of the size of the ground set... I changed it into a check that all degrees are the same.

2) The output was wrong (should be a pair if `certificate=True` and a boolean if `certificate=False`).

3) Now `self._classes` is a list of lists of blocks and not a list of lists of indices

3) Some more documentation

Tell me what you think.

Yes of course `T_T`

> 2) The output was wrong (should be a pair if `certificate=True` and a boolean if `certificate=False`).


Right right.

> 3) Now `self._classes` is a list of lists of blocks and not a list of lists of indices


That's muuuuuuch better this way ! And my ugly sorting is not needed anymore.

Thank you for that ! Let's get this in !
