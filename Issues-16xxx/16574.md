```
sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_quotient_ring.PolynomialQuotientRing_integer.random_element:14: WARNING: Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```

looks like my fault, but

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 790, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._eval_line
Failed example:
    singular.interrupt(timeout=3)  # sometimes very slow (up to 60s on sage.math, 2012)
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```

looks unrelated.
