<a id='comment:6'></a>Hi Nathann,

Globally looks good. Documentation builds and all test pass.

1) Could we make it go after #16272? There is a moderately trivial rebase to do. I think it would be easier in that direction.

2) Could we also move the `TD_6_12` into the database module?

3) In the doctests of database, I would rather call directly the function themselves followed by `is_transversal_design`. We have no idea (at least me) that the corresponding design is actually returned when we call `designs.orthogonal_array` with the good parameters. Nevertheless it is a good test to check that the latter actually return a value for those parameters (and to see whether or not it is the corresponding value).

4) (semi-stupid remark) For the 6 construction of OA from Vmt, the function is rather trivial. One way to avoid duplication is to modify the dictionnary into `n -> (k, constructor, extra_args)`. For the Vmt the entries would look like

```
OA_constructions = {
...
46: (6, OA_from_Vmt, (4,9,[0, 1, 3, 2, 8])),
50: (8, OA_from_Vmt, (6,7,[0, 1, 3, 16, 35, 26, 36])),
...
}
```

Yeah, no problem I guess.

Yepyep, I will do that.

If we do that the OA will be built when Sage starts. Plus I would like to thank Julian R. Abel somewhere.

In the doctest, I would like to see:

```
sage: TD = TD_6_12()
sage: TDbis = designs.transversal_design(6,12)
sage: TD == TDbis
True
```
It is worth it to see if the individual designs are actually used in the construction, isn't it? Even if the answer is `False` at some point, it still makes sense to keep the function and the doctest.

I do not mind too much as it is painful to edit all doctests in `database.py`.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Hi Nathann,

In `orthogonal_arrays.py` in the function `transversal_design` you added a test

```
`TD(6,12)` ::

    sage: _ = designs.transversal_design(6,12)
```
which is actually already tested in the block above it **and** in `database.py`. So if you don't mind, you can simply remove it.

Otherwise, everything is fine and it could go to positive review after that!

Vincent
