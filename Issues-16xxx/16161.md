It is not possible to use xgcd() with a list parameter.

BÃ©zout coefficients with more than two integers could be implemented in xgcd() (i.e. a1*u1 + a2*u2 + ... + an*un = g)

Example:

```
sage: xgcd2([385, 231, 165, 105])
(1, [-2, 1, 2, 2])
```

Actually this is already done using LLL in Magma to get a small solution [https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/311#2923](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/311#2923)

I think something which looks like this should work:

```
"""
INPUT: a list of integers
OUTPUT: (g, u) such that g = u1*a1 + u2*a2 + ... + un*an
"""
def xgcd2(a):
    s = len(a)
    c = ZZ(int(random()*10^s+1))
    L = matrix(ZZ, s+1, s, lambda i, j: kronecker_delta(i, j))
    L.set_row(s, a)
    L.rescale_row(s, c)
    U = (L.transpose()).LLL()
    u = list(U[s-1])[:-1]

    return (sum([ai*ui for (ai, ui) in zip(a, u)]), u)
```

Keywords: **gcd, xgcd**

Component: **basic arithmetic**
