As the title says.

With some other improvements.

The original code seems to have been written by a mathematician.

there is a bug in the optional test: the line 422 in `incidence_structures.py` should be

```
sage: PP = designs.ProjectiveGeometryDesign(2,1,GF(4,'conway'), algorithm="gap") # optional - gap_design
```
actually, it's weird that `ProjectivePlaneDesign` does not known about `algorithm=` at all.
This is a bug to be fixed, IMHO, perhaps on this ticket...

the patch is:

Nononono, I meant this "algorithm=gap" to be an argument of the function I tests, i.e. `dual_design`.

And I rename this `gap_design` (which is not even the name of a spkg) to `gap_packages`.

The standard of the bugs I fix is MUCH higher than the bugs that are not fixed in combinat, really. If THIS is a bug their code should not even be allowed to run `:-P`

Well, as I said above the "algorithm=gap" was intended for the `dual_block` method. I don't see why we would call gap to compute a dual, but anyway `:-P`

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand I added this `algorithm` argument in `ProjectivePlane` too.

Ahahaha. Yes of course. Do I change that ?

This code is awful, I am already happy to see those two "for" reverted in order to avoid a useless test. Mathematicians should not write code, all they care about is whether the code can be read like a mathematical proof, and efficiency can go to hell.

Probably. But most of your efforts will be wasted, and in the meantime you have to re-do the work when they turn their back.
