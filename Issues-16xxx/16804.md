Motivating example :

`sage: points(map(lambda x:x[0].n(),(z^20+1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` works as expected.

`sage: points(map(lambda x:x[0].n(),(z^20-1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` gives an error.

One (namely K. Crisman ) notes ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/uyiSDTxQ_2U](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/uyiSDTxQ_2U)) that some of the member of the second set are real (namely -1 and 1) while none of the members of the first set is real.

Indeed :

`points(map(N, [1+I,I,I-1,-1-I,-I,1-I]),figsize=4)` works as expected.

`points(map(N, [0,1,1+I,I,I-1,-1,-1-I,-I,1-I]),figsize=4)` gives an error.

One also notes that `points([1+I,I,I-1,-1-I,-I,1-I],figsize=4)` while conforming to `points()` documentation, gives another, different error.

Workaround suggested by K. Crisman :

`sage: points(map(lambda x:CC(x[0].n()),(z^20-1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` works as expected.

It failed the doctest

```
sage: xydata_from_point_list((1,2))
        ([1.0], [2.0])
```
when changing `CompleNumber` to `number.Complex` it did not recognize the tuple as such, interpreting it as two complex numbers on the real line. And, as [ComplexNumber](ComplexNumber) was used in the original code I thought it was justified its use. If you'd be so kind to tell me in which cases is better `number.Complex` I will do my best to use it.

I will double-check (right now I am running the full set of tests `sage -t -a ` again), I did it before pushing the commit and all tests passed OK. If you please give me one example of the tests that fails in your setting I will check it with my results asap.

It was an early unsuccessful attempt to rewrite the code from scratch. After running into many dead ends, I decided to patch the existing code to take into account the new bug, checking if there is at least one complex number within the list, the result is the last commit `df6da21` (except the debugging code line that I forgot to remove)

The original method is `point` and at the end of the model there is a `points = point` line, so I guess we have to support the 'singular' case of only one point in `xydata_from_point_list` I'll have a look into the failing case `point(1)`.

What do you mean by 'used to work'? I tested `points(complex(1j))` in cloud.sagemath.com (v6.10) and it doesn't work.
