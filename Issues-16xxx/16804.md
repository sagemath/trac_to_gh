Motivating example :

`sage: points(map(lambda x:x[0].n(),(z^20+1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` works as expected.

`sage: points(map(lambda x:x[0].n(),(z^20-1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` gives an error.

One (namely K. Crisman ) notes ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/uyiSDTxQ_2U](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/uyiSDTxQ_2U)) that some of the member of the second set are real (namely -1 and 1) while none of the members of the first set is real.

Indeed :

`points(map(N, [1+I,I,I-1,-1-I,-I,1-I]),figsize=4)` works as expected.

`points(map(N, [0,1,1+I,I,I-1,-1,-1-I,-I,1-I]),figsize=4)` gives an error.

One also notes that `points([1+I,I,I-1,-1-I,-I,1-I],figsize=4)` while conforming to `points()` documentation, gives another, different error.

Workaround suggested by K. Crisman :

`sage: points(map(lambda x:CC(x[0].n()),(z^20-1).roots()), figsize=4, aspect_ratio=1)` works as expected.

- Please add spaces around the `=` sign in affectation.

- There is a nice `elif` in Python.

- `RealNumber` and `ComplexNumber` is highly restrictive. You should use `numbers.Real` and `numbers.Complex` from Python which works well under inclusion

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(ZZ.an_element(), numbers.Real)
True
sage: isinstance(1.0r, numbers.Real)
True
sage: isinstance(CC.an_element(), numbers.Real)
False
```
  Once done, you should add doctests accordingly.

It failed the doctest

```
sage: xydata_from_point_list((1,2))
        ([1.0], [2.0])
```
when changing `CompleNumber` to `number.Complex` it did not recognize the tuple as such, interpreting it as two complex numbers on the real line. And, as [ComplexNumber](../wiki/ComplexNumber) was used in the original code I thought it was justified its use. If you'd be so kind to tell me in which cases is better `number.Complex` I will do my best to use it.

I will double-check (right now I am running the full set of tests `sage -t -a ` again), I did it before pushing the commit and all tests passed OK. If you please give me one example of the tests that fails in your setting I will check it with my results asap.

You introduced trailing whitespaces (i.e. space just before the end of a new line). You should get rid of them.

In the documentation, if there is a comment then you should add two colons and a linebreak before a new test. In other words replace

```

There should be a line break at the end of the function `xydata_from_point_list` to separate it from `plot`.

In your context, it makes no sense to use reduce. You should use either `all` or `any`.

I do not feel very confortable with the syntax

```
sage: points(CC(0,1))   # only one point !
sage: points(1)         # one point but does not work!

As the method is plural, I guess we should just forbid this case. What do you think? Depending on your answer you might want to fix

```
sage: points(CC(0,1))       # fine

The original method is `point` and at the end of the model there is a `points = point` line, so I guess we have to support the 'singular' case of only one point in `xydata_from_point_list` I'll have a look into the failing case `point(1)`.

What do you mean by 'used to work'? I tested `points(complex(1j))` in cloud.sagemath.com (v6.10) and it doesn't work.

> And ideally, numpy complex numbers should also be supported. You would better use `numbers` as adviced in [comment:8](#comment:8).

ok, ok, ok :-) I'll give it another try, last time I tried I wasn't able to make it work.

The code here has `points.real()`, `points.imag()`,
`xy.real()`, `xy.imag()`.


In some cases, see #30942, `real(z)` and `imag(z)`
work better than `z.real()` and `z.imag()`.
