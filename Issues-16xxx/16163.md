```
As discussed in #16120, the conversion from `AA` to `RR` is not accurate:

```
sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: e = AA(3/2*E(7) + E(7)^3 + E(7)^4 + 3/2*E(7)^6)
sage: RR(e).exact_rational() - e
1.328?e-17
sage: RR(e).nextbelow().exact_rational() - e
-6.0?e-19
```

The aim of this ticket is to fix this.
