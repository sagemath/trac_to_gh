As discussed in #16120, the conversion from `AA` to `RR` is not accurate:

```
sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: e = AA(3/2*E(7) + E(7)^3 + E(7)^4 + 3/2*E(7)^6)
sage: RR(e).exact_rational() - e
1.328?e-17
sage: RR(e).nextbelow().exact_rational() - e
-6.0?e-19
```

The aim of this ticket is to fix this.

Why should it be accurate? The documentation of the method `real_number` is

```
Given a ``RealField``, compute a good approximation to self in
that field. The approximation will be off by at most two
ulp's, except for numbers which are very close to 0, which
will have an absolute error at most
``2**(-(field.prec()-1))``. Also, the rounding mode of the
field is respected.
