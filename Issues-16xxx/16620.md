Previously, the introductory documentation of `graph_latex` recommended calling `setup_latex_preamble`. However, as pointed out in ticket:16557#comment:2, this is not necessary: `graph._latex_` calls `setup_latex_preamble` anyway. Therefore, the corresponding text has now been removed from this introduction.

Note, however, that the tutorial (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/latex.html#an-example-combinatorial-graphs-with-tkz-graph) has not been touched: there, the use of `setup_latex_preamble` rather seems to illustrate the behaviour of the `latex` module.
