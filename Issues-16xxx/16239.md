??? Infinite fields are not necessarily of characteristic zero, see for instance `FieldOfFractions(GF(q)['t'])`.

It could be something like `Fields() & AssociativeAlgebras(QQ)`, although implementation dictates we should avoid referencing parametrized bases for categories whenever possible (this case wouldn't be so bad, since QQ just a single object. It's when characteristic p fields are made as `Fields() & AssociativeAlgebras(GF(p))` that we have a problem.)

However what I said is all fields of characteristic 0 are fields and infinite sets (as we can always add 1 more).

Hmmm...that's an interesting idea. Nicolas, how feasible would that be?

I remember why I had things that way:

```
sage: QQ in Sets().Infinite()
False
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 7)
sage: MS in Sets().Infinite()
False
```
There will be a much larger fix needed for modules over infinite base rings recognizing that they are infinite (and `QQ` and friends will need to be in `Sets().Infinite()`). For now, I just reverted the change and added a comment. If that's okay for now, then can you set this back to positive review? Thanks.

It's not checking that it is a child of a facade parent, but that the facade parents `__call__` (and the `_element_constructor_`?) doesn't change the element. I'm wondering if facade parents should work with the coercion framework differently...

Well, for now I will just add the warning to the doctest unless anyone objects.

Whenever possible, facade parents should indeed make sure that
F(F.an_element()) == F.an_element(), and bark on
F(something_outside). Now there are many occasions, like here
probably, where it might be hard, or costly, or just impossible to
achieve.

> Well, for now I will just add the warning to the doctest unless anyone objects.


Yeah, that's life. I am ok with the change.

I ran all long tests, and with the little new commit, all tests pass. Back to positive review!

Thanks!
