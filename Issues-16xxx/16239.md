Also I should make it clear, the error came from `QQ` not being in the correct category. So should we also change that here while we're at it?

Hello,

While we are at it, this is not an isolated case...

```
sage: std_sets = [ZZ, QQ, RDF, CDF, AA, QQbar, RR, CC]
sage: any(x in Sets().Infinite() for x in std_sets)
False
```
We can open another ticket for the remaining ones.

Hey Nicolas,

I remember why I had things that way:

```
sage: QQ in Sets().Infinite()
False
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 7)
sage: MS in Sets().Infinite()
False
```
There will be a much larger fix needed for modules over infinite base rings recognizing that they are infinite (and `QQ` and friends will need to be in `Sets().Infinite()`). For now, I just reverted the change and added a comment. If that's okay for now, then can you set this back to positive review? Thanks.

Gosh, that's ugly. Oh well, we will have to do with it I guess. Thanks! I improved a bit the wording, and now back to positive review.

Hey,

It looks ok for me if you modify the doctest explaining what happened. For me it is a facade issue as a facade should be childless (i.e. there is no point in testing whether an element has a parent a given facade).

Whenever possible, facade parents should indeed make sure that
F(F.an_element()) == F.an_element(), and bark on
F(something_outside). Now there are many occasions, like here
probably, where it might be hard, or costly, or just impossible to
achieve.

> Well, for now I will just add the warning to the doctest unless anyone objects.

Yeah, that's life. I am ok with the change.

I ran all long tests, and with the little new commit, all tests pass. Back to positive review!

Thanks!
