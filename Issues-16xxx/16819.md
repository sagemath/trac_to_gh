I don't like stating that it is unindexed; in fact, it is typically indexed by `[n]`. Currently we don't have good support for other indexed instances of `FreeModule`, but this is something we want to change in the future. In that vein, I don't quite care for saying it is a column vector. Also I'd rather say that we pick an ordering of some basis if it exists, rather than saying if there exists one.

The reason I had an abstract method `module` in `LieAlgebras` was to say it was natural, but it was made optional for what I hope are obvious reasons.

I don't really like this paradigm of `from_vector`, but instead just wanted to use the basis and/or implementing a general `_element_constructor_` in the ABC which handles the conversion (if such a conversion exists).
