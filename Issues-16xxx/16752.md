String formatting via "%" is still perfectly valid in python 3, is more concise, and even faster:

```
sage: fn="a"
sage: %timeit "{%r}" % fn
10000000 loops, best of 3: 142 ns per loop
sage: %timeit "`!r`".format(fn)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 236 ns per loop
```
there's no benefit to replacing it with ".format" formatting unless we actually need facilities more easily expressed with it.
