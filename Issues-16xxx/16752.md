In #2516, there was some things that could've use some minor tweaks (python 3 compatibility, doc formatting). This ticket makes those tweaks.

String formatting via "%" is still perfectly valid in python 3, is more concise, and even faster:

```
sage: fn="a"
sage: %timeit "{%r}" % fn
10000000 loops, best of 3: 142 ns per loop
sage: %timeit "{{{!r}}}".format(fn)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 236 ns per loop
```
there's no benefit to replacing it with ".format" formatting unless we actually need facilities more easily expressed with it.

I thought they were still planning on deprecating `%` at some point in python 3, but it seems like the winds have changed to keeping it. I'm somewhat surprised `format` was that much slower too. I'll revert this change.
