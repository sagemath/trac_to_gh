As an example on how to use cartesian products of transducers as introduced in #16061, a transducer converting standard binary expansion into Gray code is constructed by emulating the standard algorithm by xoring the the standard binary expansion with its shifted version.

The class collecting common transducers introduced in #16141 now also has a (hard-coded) version of the same transducer and it is made sure that both transducers agree.

<a id='comment:4'></a>During the review I realized that the Gray-code transducer (in generators) didn't have any final states. I've corrected this. I added a doctest to print the Gray code of the first 10 non-negative integers.
Please review my changes.
