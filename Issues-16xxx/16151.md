Following creates a segfault:

```
from sage.matroids.advanced import *
M = BasisMatroid(matroids.named_matroids.Vamos())
len(M.independent_r_sets(9))
```
This is because of wrong user input (vamos matroid has only 8 elements, so there is no independent set of size bigger than 8). This ticket is to add sanity checks on user input to filter out such cases and raise appropriate exceptions.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This should do it. 

I corrected independent_r_sets and also dependent_r_sets (and then I corrected myself, since the latter needed a slightly different treatment). 

As far as I can see, flats(r) is already fool-proof, and there are no other user-facing methods that take parameters.
