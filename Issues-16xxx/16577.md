Permutation groups used to only handle permutations of `1,..n`, and the methods permute_rows and friends of matrices coped with this with an ugly and potentially confusing shift by 1. After this ticket, permutation of `0,...,n-1` are accepted and handled as can be expected. For permutations of `1..n` and subsets the behavior is unchanged for backward compatibility.

This ticket also includes the following changes:
- A rewrite of the documentation
- New documentation on a related method
- Code refactorization to avoid some duplication
- The implementation of M.permute_rows_and_columns(sigma)

* As we discussed in person, there may be a few missing colons.
* Why gone?

```

```
  I mean, it will be different, but this is helpful to the user to learn how it works.  Right now it's only in the warning which of course some people will ignore ... because it's a warning.  Actually, it looks like you only do that once.
* I think this will probably break.

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup(['(1,2,3)', '(-1,0,1,2,3)'])
```
  GAP doesn't complain when I ask for this group's order!
* Also, probably there is no point to SEEALSO the actual function in each case.  E.g. `permute_columns` should not SEEALSO itself.
* `swap_columns_c` test, if it's new, should probably be in the wrapper `swap_columns`.

But actually this looks pretty good and straightforward.

The missing colons are in the warning sections.  Also, you don't have a warning in the `with` methods though they have examples of that.

The sanity checks are not changed by ticket, and it keeps on failing
cleanly as before.

> * Also, probably there is no point to SEEALSO the actual function in each case.  E.g. `permute_columns` should not SEEALSO itself.
> * `swap_columns_c` test, if it's new, should probably be in the wrapper `swap_columns`.


Oops, right!

Hi Karl!

Just a ping for finishing the review of the hopefully final commit?

Thanks!

I should almost make you wait longer just for the length of your branch name!

You need to change `\hdots` to `\ldots` for it to work properly in the documentation.  Otherwise this is fine.

Of course, there is the meta-question of whether one should really change this behavior.  Have you talked to anyone else about that?  It is indeed backward-compatible but still one might ask whether matrix rows are numbered at 0 or 1... though with Python probably the previous behavior was more wrong than the current one...

Replying to [kcrisman](#comment%3A11):

:-)

Most of the name was built by git trac from the summary; I'd been too lazy to type this in myself :-)

Done.

Sage matrices/vectors/... (under the influence of Python) are
unambiguously indexed by 0..n-1, aren't they? After all that's the
convention used systematically in all other methods (row, set_row,
col, __getitem__, ...).

In this sense, permute_rows and friends were the exceptions. That's
why I did not bother yet advertising this ticket specifically (beside
you, Anne, and whoever is following it). We could make a call on
sage-devel if you think this is really needed.

Cheers,
                                    Nicolas

But perhaps not pushed?  It's not in your commit list.

You know, I'd feel better if you just put a little blurb there saying, "we want to make this change because it seemed more in line with 0-based counting, but in case anyone cares say something on the ticket."  If we don't hear back, switch it to positive review.
