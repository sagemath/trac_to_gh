There is one example used in several places in the documentation of module `animate`:

```
sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.3)],
....:                xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1]) # indirect doctest
```

However, at least on my system the individual frames are of slightly different sizes, ranging from 184×84 to 184×90. And the image looks pretty strange as well:

![](ticket:16570:broken-example.gif)

This seems to be mostly due to the fact that the axis range, described by `xmin` and `xmax`, doesn't automatically fix a range for `x`. Instead, it seems as if `x` will automatically range from `-1` to `1`, but clipped to approximately the axis range.

My suggested remedy is to actually provide a range for `x`, and I'll upload a branch for this. I'll also address some other documentation and testsuite issues in this. Some of the tests take longer than one second, but aren't marked as long. One figure looks so small you can't see anything. And the information a user receives in response to `animate?` is pretty sparse, since most examples are at the module level. So I introduced a cross reference to that.

This ticket is a spin-off from some work I did for #16533.

Reasonable suggestion, but I'm somewhat uncertain where to put this. I guess it would be best to put this into the docstring of the whole module. There it might go after the warning about the need for ImageMagick or FFmpeg, or as one of the examples, towards the end.

As a side note, my code from #16571 introduces a doc test which exhibits the APNG generator complaining about incorrect sizes. Mainly to help people understand the error message issued in this case.

> Maybe you can even refer to this ticket.


I'd probably word this as follows:

“Note that it is your responsibility to provide frames with matching sizes. Otherwise the result is undefined: the animation might fail to save, fail to play back, or simply look strange. Most often you'll want to ensure common coordinate systems as well, so passing `xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax` as parameters is quite common. Prior to trac ticket !#16570, one of the running examples in the documentation violated this requirement:”

Then I'd paste the broken example, but only the construction, without the command to display it. That way there is not much work for the doctests, and we can add checks for common frame size to the implementation later on without breaking that doctest.

In the long run, a better alternative might be not to warn users but to avoid the unexpected behavior by choosing a common coordinate system automatically. But that will be more work. I just filed #16654 to keep track of that idea.

I'm about to review this one and have some questions:
- what should the line 

```
 a.show() # optional -- ImageMagick
```
do? (I have ImageMagick installed), but nothing happens: nothing is displayed in the notebook and no error occurs.
However, I can save the gif and then look at it using a viewer, e.g. 'gthumb'
- how to show the animation in the notebook (if at all?)
 

There is also a (unchanged) line in the doctest
`a.gif() # not tested`

Q: what does that mean?

What should I look at in addition?

If I didn't miss or screw op something, I just checked out the ticket.
If I remember correctly, 'sage' showed me that I'm on 6.3.beta4.

Probably I should rebase first, or someone else should rebase the ticket?

good, after I updated the ffmpeg 0.6.5 manually on my machine (Scientific Linux 6.5), the doctests passed!

Otherwise ffmpeg 0.6.5. complains about the 'long' parameter argument. This might be a different new(?) issue, since several universities have SL installations. (SL packages are dated)

All fixed examples worked as expected. However, there are two other broken animate examples;
would you mind to fix them in this ticket? (see below)

What also should be changed (maybe also in this ticket, since it is a pretty small change),
is storing the name of the temporary directory in variable named 'dir'. 'dir' is a keyword/a method
and should not be overwritten

```
############# # problem with the varying axis range #############  
#################### line 417

a = animate([plot(x^2 + n) for n in range(4)])
a.show()

#################### line 449
E = EllipticCurve('37a')
v = [E.change_ring(GF(p)).plot(pointsize=30) for p in [97, 101, 103, 107]]
a = animate(v, xmin=0, ymin=0)
a
a.show() # optional -- ImageMagick
```
There is also one example with unreadable axis labels:

```
##############   problem with the axis labels - unreadable #############  
############# line 294
a = animate([circle((i,0),1) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],
                xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=3, ymax=1, figsize=[2,1])
a.show()        # optional -- ImageMagick
b = animate([circle((0,i),1,hue=0) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],
                xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=1, ymax=3, figsize=[1,2])
b.show()        # optional -- ImageMagick
```

and two examples with unfortunate axis range, but that is probably discussable:

```
#############   image section not optimal: #############  
#############  line 326
a = animate([circle((i,0),1,thickness=20*i) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],
                xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=3, ymax=1, figsize=[2,1], axes=False)
a.show()             # optional -- ImageMagick
b = animate([circle((0,i),1,hue=0,thickness=20*i) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],
                xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=1, ymax=3, figsize=[1,2], axes=False)
b.show()             # optional -- ImageMagick
p = a*b              # indirect doctest
len(a), len(b)
len(p)
(a*b).show()         # optional -- ImageMagick

#################### line 352
a = animate([circle((i,0),1,thickness=20*i) for i in srange(0,2,0.4)],
             xmin=0, ymin=-1, xmax=3, ymax=1, figsize=[2,1], axes=False)
a.show()
```

Sounds like a different issue, yes. We might have to implement some version detection there. Will you file a ticket for this? According to the [FFmpeg News archive](http://ffmpeg.org/archive.html) that version dates from January 2012.

I did so in the commit I just pushed.

Overwriting [the dir builtin](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#dir) within the tests causes no immediate harm. Only when users adapt these tests and therefore loose access to the builtin, then we'd have some impact. Nevertheless, I'll change the name to `td`.

I fixed the other plots you mentioned. In the case of `a*b`, the "unfortunate" range might in fact help demonstrate how this operation behaves in the presence of non-matching ranges, so I'd leave that as it is. And the last unfortunate range has no impact on the issue being demonstrated, so I'll leave that as well.

I hope you'll have time to give this a positive review, even though I took quite long to react to your input.

Except the `x^2` plot (line 417, ff) everything is ok now.
For that example `ymax` changes during the animation for me.
If that is not by intention, I would set  `ymax=4` or similar.

> Overwriting ​the dir builtin within the tests causes no immediate harm. Only when users adapt these tests and therefore loose access to the builtin, then we'd have some impact. 


That is exactly why I issued the usage of `dir` !

> Nevertheless, I'll change the name to td


in general I find self-descriptive naming like `'tempDir'` better,
but that is up to you if you want to keep 'td' or change it to something more descriptive.

> […] this behaviour is a regression. I happened to try the example in 5.10 and there the animation appeared as one would expect. So it seems that xmin and xmax were used as bounds for x at some point before.


After almost two days of bisecting, I got the culprit: it's #12827 – again.

[9eddf99](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/9eddf99b572caa0c28ffa40dd154ad9c8f952255) broke the example, causing error messages instead. By [5a10336](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/5a10336948b7befec35c0c0d99defbceb348e5d9) the example could be executed again, but looked broken as described. Looking at [the changes in between](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/?id2=0c6fcdf462e329c80eeaf2841ac1659308aad90c&id=5a10336948b7befec35c0c0d99defbceb348e5d9) the issue becomes apparent. The `__init__` method is changed like this:

```
-        w = []
-        for x in v:
-            if not isinstance(x, sage.plot.graphics.Graphics):
-                x = plot.plot(x, (kwds.get('xmin',0), kwds.get('xmax', 1)))
-            w.append(x)
-        if len(w) == 0:
-            w = [sage.plot.graphics.Graphics()]
-        self._frames = w
+        ## 
+        ## code for type-checking input -- seems like a bad idea
+        ##
+        # if typecheck_input:
+        #     w = []
+        #     for x in v:
+        #         if not is_graphic(x):
+        #             x = plot.plot(x, (kwds.get('xmin',0), kwds.get('xmax', 1)))
+        #         w.append(x)
+        #     if len(w) == 0:
+        #         w = [plot.Graphics()]
+        # else:
+        #     w = v
+        self._frames = v
         self._kwds = kwds
```

and as a replacement we get the new `make_image` method:

```
+        p = plot.plot(frame)
+        p.save_image(filename, **kwds)
```

If I move the `**kwds` from the `sage_image` call to the `plot` call, the example looks nice again. I guess I'll try this change and see how the rest of the animate test suite behaves for this.

I'm not too familiar with sage/python,
but I guess, in `make_image()` `**kwds` should also be passed to `save_image()`?

In principle, the [very first line](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/plot.py?id=d1eeb8f187ec15f7c032a35e3dc19654482da26d#n1236) in `plot.plot` being

```
G_kwds = Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(kwds, ignore=['xmin', 'xmax'])
```
and near the end being

```
G._set_extra_kwds(G_kwds)
```
should suffice for that, but if you can think of a way this messes it up, that would be helpful.

Edit: looks like Martin and I agree on this.

> G_kwds = Graphics._extract_kwds_for_show(kwds, ignore=['xmin', 'xmax'])


I have a question related to the `xmin/xmax` weirdness (my subjective impression), which has no influence on the positive review of this ticket:

- why is `xmin` and `xmax` ignored for G_kwds?
- there is ` xmin ` and `xmax` for starting and ending x value and same options names (for show() ) to limit the horizontal x-axis?
- is the `xmin/xmax ` stuff (axis limit, start/end x value, ignored options)  documentation for `plot(), show()` sufficient and understandable for users ?
