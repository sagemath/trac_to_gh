`sage -sync-build` doesn't understand wildcards, so it deletes a bunch of correctly-installed `sage.symbolic` modules.

Really, the whole concept is broken. We should at the very least record what is being installed instead of trying to guess it in sync-build. Even better, make it part of the build process.

There is quite a lot of setup code, none of which is doctested. And, therefore, broken. As this ticket shows. I've started to move setup code into a `sage_setup` package that is installed with Sage and can be doctested in the usual manner.

Also:
* Having `SAGE_LIB` point to `SAGE_SRC` is actually never useful, removed.
* re-enable out-of-tree cythonize

I think you can remove the `sdist` variable entirely from `setup.py`, i.e., also

```python
if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "sdist":
    sdist = True
else:
    sdist = False
```

Yes, the setup.py should be broken up and doctested. And we need to decide whether we want to support sdist or not (in which case the Manifest.in can probably go, too). But thats for another ticket.
