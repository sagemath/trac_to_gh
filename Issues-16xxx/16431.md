`sage -sync-build` doesn't understand wildcards, so it deletes a bunch of correctly-installed `sage.symbolic` modules.

Really, the whole concept is broken. We should at the very least record what is being installed instead of trying to guess it in sync-build. Even better, make it part of the build process.

There is quite a lot of setup code, none of which is doctested. And, therefore, broken. As this ticket shows. I've started to move setup code into a `sage_setup` package that is installed with Sage and can be doctested in the usual manner.

Also:
* Having `SAGE_LIB` point to `SAGE_SRC` is actually never useful, removed.
* re-enable out-of-tree cythonize

Is that (still) used anywhere in Sage?  (I mean calling *Sage's* `setup.py` with `sdist`.)
