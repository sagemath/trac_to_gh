`sage -sync-build` doesn't understand wildcards, so it deletes a bunch of correctly-installed `sage.symbolic` modules.

Really, the whole concept is broken. We should at the very least record what is being installed instead of trying to guess it in sync-build. Even better, make it part of the build process.

There is quite a lot of setup code, none of which is doctested. And, therefore, broken. As this ticket shows. I've started to move setup code into a `sage_setup` package that is installed with Sage and can be doctested in the usual manner.

Also:
* Having `SAGE_LIB` point to `SAGE_SRC` is actually never useful, removed.
* re-enable out-of-tree cythonize

Mostly looks good, I haven't checked cython modules, but it doesn't seem like it really handles them at the moment (which would agree with some TODO I think I read in the documentation of some function). Are you planning on adding support for them at the moment, or on a future ticket?

I added a few minor reviewer changes.
