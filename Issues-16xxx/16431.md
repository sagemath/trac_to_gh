`sage -sync-build` doesn't understand wildcards, so it deletes a bunch of correctly-installed `sage.symbolic` modules.

Really, the whole concept is broken. We should at the very least record what is being installed instead of trying to guess it in sync-build. Even better, make it part of the build process.

There is quite a lot of setup code, none of which is doctested. And, therefore, broken. As this ticket shows. I've started to move setup code into a `sage_setup` package that is installed with Sage and can be doctested in the usual manner.

Also:
* Having `SAGE_LIB` point to `SAGE_SRC` is actually never useful, removed.
* re-enable out-of-tree cythonize

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A12):
> And we need to decide whether we want to support sdist or not (in which case the Manifest.in can probably go, too).


Is that (still) used anywhere in Sage?  (I mean calling *Sage's* `setup.py` with `sdist`.)

Mostly looks good, I haven't checked cython modules, but it doesn't seem like it really handles them at the moment (which would agree with some TODO I think I read in the documentation of some function). Are you planning on adding support for them at the moment, or on a future ticket?

I added a few minor reviewer changes.
