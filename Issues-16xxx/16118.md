Currently, the only way to obtain the cache's length of a `lazy_list` is to call `info` method which print on the standard output :

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: l = lazy_list(NN)
sage: l[42]
sage: l.info()
cache length 43
start        0
stop         2147483647
step         1
```

The goal of this ticket is to provide a `__len__` method to obtain this length :

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: l = lazy_list(NN)
sage: len(l)
0
sage: l[42]
42
sage: len(l)
43
sage: l[36]
36
sage: len(l)
43
```
