The tool 2to3 removes the imports. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import filter` and to check where a wrapping with `list()` is required.

There are 13 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

**Keywords:** python3
