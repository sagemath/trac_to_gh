There is no way to handle the color parameter when the `fill` option is provided. `implicit_plot` should also accept a `fillcolor` parameter, just like `plot` does, and pass `fillcolor` and `color` on to `region_plot` as `incol` and `bordercol`, respectively.

```
$ ./sage -t src/sage/plot/contour_plot.py 
too many failed tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2014-08-22-16-06-05-3f1b7b16.
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t src/sage/plot/contour_plot.py
    [123 tests, 25.81 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 25.9 seconds
    cpu time: 25.5 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 25.8 seconds
```
Two requests:
* Add an example with a different color and fill color (for the user), if possible one where the function is not a symbolic expression (just to test that branch).
* Technically, I guess both occurrences of `string (default: ``blue``)` should be `string (default: ``'blue'``)`.  Is that right?  I know you will actually care about getting this right :-)
Otherwise this is great, nice work.  Interesting that it didn't work at all before.
