I don't get your function `is_projective_plane_cardinality`. The doc of `sqrtrem` seems to say that `q` is the largest integer such that `q^2<=n`. Why do you increase `q` in a while loop ?

- In `OA_9_135` you remove the definition of `PG2 = set([x*39 for x in range(7)])` but it still appears in the documentation. And it is nice to have an object representing that to describe more clearly what the function does.

  And you repeat this %39 everywhere right now.

- <code>The set of \`GF(q)\` lines in \`V\` is a projective plane</code>. The set of `(q<sup>3-1)/(q-1)=q</sup>2+q+1` lines ? Either way `GF(q)` is not an integer.

- `+        spaces/.`

- ` Kq (i.e the (q-1)-th root of unity`

- About the second part of function `singer_difference_set` : what would you think of implementing 3.16 instead ? It builds the cyclic difference set from a cyclic automorphism of a BIBD... And it could be useful later, like when we will have a `BIBD.is_cyclic` function.

Which we can write easily now that BIBD are a class `:-D`

```
sage: def is_cyclic(BIBD):
....:     repr = BIBD.automorphism_group().conjugacy_classes_representatives()
....:     repr = [x.cycles() for x in repr]
....:     for x in repr:
....:         if len(x) == 1 and len(x[0].tuple()) == BIBD.num_points():
....:             return x[0].tuple()
....:     return False
sage: is_cyclic(designs.balanced_incomplete_block_design(13,3))
(1, 9, 8, 7, 12, 10, 5, 2, 11, 3, 0, 4, 6)
```

I will put it back if you prefer. I just remarked that I removed an important comment about PG2 being the set of points = 0 mod 39.

But note that it is faster to test "x%39 == 0" rather than building PG2 and then test "x in PG2".

No, `GF(q)` is not a number but a field. It refers to line as line in a vector space over `GF(q)`. The very same way you would speak about `RR` lines in `CC`. Isn't that clear enough?

It is stupid. You will have to first build the projective space, then compute its automorphism group that we already know and then apply a big hammer.

Your commit does not seem to remove any comment `O_o`

I know I know, but for such functions I gladly exchange a clear code against a speedup. Which I expect is not so bad... 

You can remove this PG2 if you want but then you must change the explanation accordingly !

Given that the base field is `GF(q)` just talking about lines is clear enough though, isn't it ? You can leave it like that if you want, I am not used to talk of "RR lines in CC", that's all.

> It is stupid. 


Now try to think : you don't have to USE `is_cyclic` in your function. You have the base block, i.e. `GF(q)-0` in `GF(q^3)-0`, and you can define the automorphism on `GF(q^3)-0` with your generator. You don't have to build the projective plane nor to compute its group, BUT you can use theorem 3.16 exactly as it is done in the book, by providing the base block and a cyclic action on the ground set. 3.16 just does a relabelling.

Moreover, the set of points is not the vector space but the quotient of `V \ {0}` by scalar multiplication. So the strategy of theorem 3.16 does not apply directly.

Nevertheless, it would be nice to have 3.16 done somewhere! But I am not sure that this ticket is the right place.

Hi Nathann,

I did what you think was better, but I just find it ugly. At least, I did something good: it now work for any dimension. And it needs review!

Hello again !

Sorry but it still is a bit hard for me to read those explanations and I go slowly, it isn't really my world `^^;`

- In the doc of `are_projective_space_parameters` you give the equations that `v,k,lmbda` must satisfy, but could you say it "with words" before that ? Something like "such that the projective geometry of parameters xx,xx,xx is a xx,xx,xx design ?" 

- I had begun to write a commit linking this function with `ProjectiveGeometryDesign` but I did not know enough to finish the review `^^;`

Hi,

> - In the doc of `are_projective_space_parameters` you give the equations that `v,k,lmbda` must satisfy, but could you say it "with words" before that ? Something like "such that the projective geometry of parameters xx,xx,xx is a xx,xx,xx design ?" 


will do: these are the parameters of a projective space design (assuming that they only exists for prime powers ;-)
 
> - I had begun to write a commit linking this function with `ProjectiveGeometryDesign` but I did not know enough to finish the review `^^;`


Yeah it would be cool to check the t-design parameters of projective geometry designs fit what `are_projective_space_parameters` check for. Actually, it would make sense to move `are_projective_space_parameters` to `block_design.py`. What do you think?

> - I do not understand the code yet, but don't you want to use the 'conway=True` trick in `singer_difference_set` ?


Nope. I need relative extensions `GF(q) -> GF(q^(d+1))`. The trick would only "work" for prime fields. Moreover, testing if an element of an extension belongs to the span over `GF(q)` of `(1,z,...,z^(d-1))` is a mess (and trivial if you deal directly with polyonials).

I agree that I mimic an extension of `GF(q)` by dealing with polynomials mod `c` (the relative Conway polynomial), but it seems the easiest way to go.

Also : don't we use at the same time "projective space design" and "projective geometry design" ?

It follows Stinson but the loop is stopped sooner.

The field `Kbig` with q<sup>e+1</sup> elements is a vector space over `Ksmall` the one with q elements. We chose a generator z of the multiplicative group of `Kbig` (that way we have a cyclic action on lines). We also choose a concrete subspace of dimension `d` in `Kbig` to be the span (over `Ksmall`) of 1,z,...z<sup>d-1</sup>. Let call it `V` this subspace.

The difference set is by definition the set of integers `i` such that `z^i` belong to `V` (recall that any element of `Kbig` different from `0` can be written as `z^i` with `i < q^e`).

This is what Stinson does and this is what I am doing.

1) You are already computing a logarithm, so it is at most as hard as a for loop. It is only "hard" because these guys measure complexity with respect to `log(n)`

2) It is "hard" to factor stuff, yet there is something "more efficient" that trying all integers smaller than `n` (stop at `sqrt(n)`)

3) It is exactly because it is a useful operation that we should have a function for it. Of course it's not our job to implement it but perhaps we should have a simple way to do that in Sage ?...  `O_o`

If you want to compute the logarithm of a bunch of numbers I am not sure there is something better than trial multiplication... and doing it for each element of your set is definitely a bad idea.

I am pretty sure I studied this at the University

```
sage: sage.groups.generic.bsgs
```

I forgot all of it, though... But I guess it shouldn't be a standalone function like that.
