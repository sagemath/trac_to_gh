A bunch of tutorial and demos were written at the occasion of
Sage(-Combinat) days and gathered in a patch on the Sage-Combinat
queue.

The purpose of this ticket is to make this patch into a branch to keep
the material alive, and track the progress on getting the interesting
stuff merged into Sage.

# Tutorials

- sage.modules.tutorial_free_modules: #20618
  High priority; needs proofreading
- tutorial-implementing-algebraic-structures: #20618
  High priority; needs proofreading
- tutorial-parallel
  Needs proofreading; could need being extended before merging
- tutorial-editing-sage-sources
  Needs update w.r.t. git
  Needs links toward the dev manual
  Is it still useful w.r.t. the dev manual? Maybe as a demo?

# Demos

- demo-basics
- sage.plot.demo
- demo-doc
- sage.databases.demo_short
- demo-number-theory
- demo-symbolics
- demo-modelling-mathematics
- demo-constructions-categories-short ()
- demo-cython

- sage.combinat
- sage.combinat.demo_short
- sage.combinat.demo
- sage.combinat.demo_algebraic_combinatorics
- demo-symmetric-functions
- sage.combinat.words.demo

# Demos on monoids and representation theory (depends on not yet in Sage code)

- demo-GAP3-Semigroupe
- demo-monoids-character_rings
- demo-monoids-characters
- demo-tsetlin-library
- demo-monoids-jtrivial

# Demos on dynamics

- demo-origamis
- bobo.2012.dynamique
- sage.dynamics.interval_exchanges.tutorial (isn't in this branch)

# Lecture notes in French for the class Agregation Option Calcul Formel

Some material there could be translated

- introduction to Sage
- sorting and complexity
- linear algebra
- the tsetlin library (application of the previous to Markov chain;
  mostly translated in algebraic_combinatorics/tsetlin_library)
- fast linear algebra
- symmetric group
- fast multiplications
- linear programming

# Lecture notes in French from the CIMPA summer school in Bobo Dioulasso 2012

- combinatorics on words
- dynamics

# Outdated

- tutorial-how-to-contribute

# Some reorganization of the thematic tutorial index?
