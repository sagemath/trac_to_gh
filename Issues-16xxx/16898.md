The same, as suspected, with `i`, so #6882 is the culprit.

Well, so `sefms` should know about existing Sage variables and prepend the underscore only if the variable doesn't exist:

```
sage: sefms('e')
_e
sage: e = var('e')
sage: sefms('e')
e
```

To recall, some marking is needed because removal of `_SAGE_VAR_` has already happened before `sefms`, and `e` could well be a Maxima variable. We just didn't think that someone could use such Sage variables.

Well, anything in a symbolic matrix (or a symbolic integral, or limit) gets sent to Maxima and back.  But maybe just raw variables are the only worry here.

The following would be the thing to fix.

```
sage: e = var('e')
sage: e == maxima(e)._sage_()
e == _e

whereas

```
sage: reset()
sage: e == maxima(e)._sage_()
e == e

I don't think so. It should both be `e == e` because the first time you're giving the variable as argument, and the second time the constant. Rather:

```
sage: e = var('e')
sage: e == maxima(e)._sage_()
e == e
sage: reset()
sage: e == maxima(e)._sage_()
e == e
sage: e == maxima('e')._sage_()
e == _e
```

Fix proposal following.

It was much easier than feared because we could get to the string before removal of `_SAGE_VAR_`. The method is to mark specific maxima vars in the string with underscore. Note: this or a different prefix could be given to all maxima vars.

Would it be possible to fix this properly? It should really be *easier* to do the conversion properly now that *variables* get converted to something with a `_SAGE_VAR_` prefix.

From sage to maxima: At this point you know whether an object is a symbolic variable or a (predefined) symbolic constant. In one case you convert it to the string `_SAGE_VAR_e`, in the other case you convert it to `%e`.

From maxima to sage: This is the trickier one, because the strings-based interface needs to try to tell everything from string representations. However, since we're either seeing `%e` or `_SAGE_VAR_e`, there's not really any confusion. Whether a variable "e" exists doesn't even matter. Indeed, we have

```
sage: var('e')
e
sage: e==exp(1)
e == e
sage: bool(e==exp(1))
False
sage: (e==exp(1))._maxima_init_()
'_SAGE_VAR_e = exp(1)'
```
so we should make sure that `%e` gets converted back to `sage.functions.log.exp(1)` and that that `_SAGE_VAR_e` gets converted to `SR.var('e')`.

The round trip currently goes horribly wrong:

```
sage: A=e==exp(1)
sage: A
sage: maxima_calculus(A) # this is fine
_SAGE_VAR_e=%e
sage: A_roundtrip=maxima_calculus(A)._sage_()
sage: A_roundtrip.lhs() #a new symbol got invented!
_e
sage: bool(A_roundtrip.rhs() == exp(1)) #and the right hand side is now a symbolic variable!
False
sage: bool(maxima_calculus(A)._sage_())
False
sage: bool(maxima_calculus(maxima_calculus(A)._sage_())._sage_()) #fun all the way.
True
```

If confusion arises, then this is probably due to inappropriate string substitutions. It may well be that sefms is up for a major refactoring.

I was a little surprised that `max_to_sr` and `sr_to_max` get this wrong too:

```
sage: max_to_sr(maxima_calculus(sr_to_max(A)).ecl())
e == e
sage: bool(max_to_sr(maxima_calculus(sr_to_max(A)).ecl()))
True
```

but this may be because currently, sr_to_max/max_to_sr get their initial translations from string-based. Certainly the infrastructure for these routines fully allows to distinguish objects regardless of their printed representation. These could be fixed by handling "symbolic variables" and "_SAGE_VAR_..." symbols (on the lisp side) separately (in sr_to_max/max_to_sr). That would reduce chances that we mess up the translation tables. In fact, objects of type `sage.symbolic.function_factory.NewSymbolicFunction` should probably be translated to `_SAGE_FUNC_...` in maxima for similar reasons.

Well, I think it's better to apply this quick fix and work towards abandoning of the expect interface.

The proposed fix doesn't solve the issue, though. I've tried the branch here and I get this:

```
sage: A = SR.var('e')==exp(1)
sage: A # the printing of this may be confusing but the meaning to sage is clear
e == e
sage: bool(A)
False
sage: bool(SR(maxima_calculus(A))) #the distinction doesn't survive the round-trip.
True
sage: A.rhs().is_symbol()
False
sage: SR(maxima_calculus(A)).rhs().is_symbol()
True
```
so it seems that the existence of a variable `e` in pynac causes maxima's `%e` to be translated to `SR.var('e')`. Illustrating this directly:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
sage: sefms('%e').is_symbol()
False
sage: SR.var('e') #apparently this affects the translation
e
sage: sefms('%e').is_symbol()
True
```
It seems that changing the entry for `symtable['%e']` to `'exp(1)'` sort-of fixes this, but obviously, for `%i` and `%I` we have the same problem.

This won't be quite bulletproof either, due to:

```
sage: function('log')
log
sage: sage.functions.log.log(x) == log(x)
```
but that currently won't even make it *to* maxima (that would need a `_SAGE_FUNCTION_log` encoding)

Nice one. That's a separate ticket, I think, though:

```
sage: f=pari.pollegendre(4,e)
sage: g=SR(f)
sage: g.operator()
sage: g.operands()
[]
sage: g.pyobject() is f
True
```
Apparently pari "polynomials" don't get properly converted to SR, but just get stuffed in. Consequently, the sage-to-maxima conversion just sees if maxima can make sense of the string representation. For instance (and that's what you see) variables don't get properly converted:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(g) #note no _SAGE_VAR_ prefixes
35*e^4/8-15*e^2/4+3/8
```
Other paths lead to errors:

```
sage: QQ['e'](g)
TypeError: Unable to coerce PARI 35/8*e^4 - 15/4*e^2 + 3/8 to an Integer
```
The truth is, almost everything can be stuffed in SR and, as a result, not everything in SR can be translated to maxima:

```
sage: M=pari.matrix(2,2)
sage: M
[0, 0; 0, 0]
sage: M.simplify_full()
AttributeError: 'MaximaLibElement' object has no attribute '_name'
sage: maxima_calculus(M) #maxima's reader chokes on [0,0;0,0] because it's ungrammatical in maximan
TypeError: ECL says: THROW: The catch MACSYMA-QUIT is undefined.
```
We can hide the bad behaviour in the particular example you gave by folding both `_SAGE_VAR_e` and `e` back onto `e` but you'd still get wrong answers:

```
sage: integrate(g,e)
integrate(35/8*e^4 - 15/4*e^2 + 3/8, e)
sage: integrate(g,e).simplify()
1/8*(35*_e^4 - 30*_e^2 + 3)*e
```
In the latter one, at least we now see something funny has happened. If it were to multiply out, it's truly confusing.
