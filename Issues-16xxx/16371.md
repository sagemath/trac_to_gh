Hi André,

I did a `./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-tp4-all-long-16371` and got no failures :-). Now I will look at all the 63 changed modules (since I am concerned that Sage has not enough (doc)tests). 

I had run the doctest with the "-3" command line option (with mixed success). I attach part of the results as they are related to *division*. There is a pretty large overlap with your changes, but there is not a complete match! 

Therefor I am curious: How did you find / determine the `/` that you changed into `//`?

I also tried to estimate how complete your patch might be. I ran `futurize -w  -f division src/sage` that inserted <code>form \`__future__\` import division</code> into 401 py module. I compared the test results from your patch vs. the current develop branch:
|       |               |                   |                 |

So this this is already quite a progress :-)

I went through the results of

```
. src/binsage-env
python2 -Qwarn ./local/bin/sage-runtests --long src/sage/SUBDIR
```
and tried to reduce the number of warnings.

Hi,

I've reviewed the 63 modules and it looked OK :-)

Then I tried to find MORE division to change. 

That resulted in patch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16371`. The patch tested with no failures. But then I inserted the <code>from \`__future__\` import division</code> and run the tests again. I was hoping for an improvement, but the result is actually worse :-(( (see the last column in the table  compared with the previous column).

|       |               |                   |                 |                          |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
|Aspect |develop / 16371|develop + division |16471 + division |develop + MORE + division |
|runtime [sec] |2,573 |7,870 |3,435 |3,603 |
|failures |0 |8,776 |2,820 |3,065 |
|log lines |5,090 |24,198,439 |72,581 |74,464 |

So I did not put my branch into this ticket! 

Can you see why the branch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16371` did not result in visible progress? Or is the measurement misleading? 

How to make progress and when do we know when we are done??

Have you changed `__div__` to `__truediv__` after inserting <code>from \`__future__\` import division</code>?

We probably have to update or patch some 3rd party libs which are still using the *old* `__div__`. Otherwise calling their division functions will fail.

Let's fix the remaining divisions in #15995 or another ticket.

No, I have changed nothing to `__truediv__`. And that should be done only very carefully and with a clearly documented strategy.

I agree that the next step(s) should go into a separate ticket.

I will check (and test) this complete patch once more. Stay tuned.
