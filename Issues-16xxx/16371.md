Therefor I am curious: How did you find / determine the `/` that you changed into `//`?

I went through the results of

```
. src/binsage-env
python2 -Qwarn ./local/bin/sage-runtests --long src/sage/SUBDIR
```
and tried to reduce the number of warnings.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi,

I've reviewed the 63 modules and it looked OK :-)

Then I tried to find MORE division to change. 

That resulted in patch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16371`. The patch tested with no failures. But then I inserted the `from __future__ import division` and run the tests again. I was hoping for an improvement, but the result is actually worse :-(( (see the last column in the table  compared with the previous column).

|       |               |                   |                 |                          |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
|Aspect |develop / 16371|develop + division |16471 + division |develop + MORE + division |
|runtime [sec] |2,573 |7,870 |3,435 |3,603 |
|failures |0 |8,776 |2,820 |3,065 |
|log lines |5,090 |24,198,439 |72,581 |74,464 |
So I did not put my branch into this ticket! 

Can you see why the branch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16371` did not result in visible progress? Or is the measurement misleading? 

How to make progress and when do we know when we are done??
