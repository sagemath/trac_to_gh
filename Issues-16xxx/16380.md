currently libGAP loads slower than GAP with pexpect interface. 

```
$ ./sage --nodotsage

sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m7.06s, Wall time 0m16.95s).
```

About extra 7 sec on a Core2 `x86_64` machine, at least according to the CPU time report, which might be lying(?).

The main issue is in  saving/loading a GAP workspace, which is not done by `libGAP` at the moment. See also https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap/issue/2/workspace-support

I should retract this, my timings were off. Now I bet that it really is the main problem of slowness on startup.

Should we mimic the way "normal" GAP deals with the workspaces? Or are there other/better ideas?
