```

About extra 7 sec on a Core2 `x86_64` machine, at least according to the CPU time report, which might be lying(?).

The main issue is in  saving/loading a GAP workspace, which is not done by `libGAP` at the moment. See also https://bitbucket.org/vbraun/libgap/issue/2/workspace-support

Why is `libgap` linked to `libgmp` rather than  to `libmpir` (which are copies of each other, as far as I can tell) ? My understanding is that   `libmpir` is already loaded at Sage startup, while `libgmp` is not. If we are hit by `dlopen` slowness, this might be something to consider changing.

I should retract this, my timings were off. Now I bet that it really is the main problem of slowness on startup.

The workspace to load should be created by `libGAP`, and not by "normal" `GAP`. Then it all works.

Should we mimic the way "normal" GAP deals with the workspaces? Or are there other/better ideas?

It does right now because you get the "Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed." which touches `libgap.la`. Which, in turn, invalidates the saved workspace. Though that is not a good mechanism, and we probably want to get rid of the sage-location thing. There should be a generic hook to delete cached stuff after installing of packages, but afaik there is none. The GAP interface has the same problem, I think.
