There is a need for the constructor QuaternionAlgebra to take as input a number field F and a ramification (specified by an ideal D in F and a set of real places S of F) and which constructs a quaternion algebra over F with ramified precisely at the primes dividing D and at the places in S.

We have code to add here, which is now being tested and documented.

A small remark regarding the ValueError in line 636: the exponents in the 
discriminant factorization should be equal to 1, and not just odd.

By the way, is there a reason why the input is an ideal of F instead of a list 
of prime ideals of F? If I want to construct a quaternion algebra with a 
prescribed ramification set of finite primes, I'd have to use their product as 
input, and then the constructor would have to factor it back (see line 634).

Thanks for accepting my proposal.

Now the new input format, QuaternionAlgebra(K, "list of primes", S) is quite different from the one you are extending to number fields other than QQ, QuaternionAlgebra(D). I feel this controversy should be avoided. The problem  could be addressed by letting this new constructor accept *both* a discriminant and a list of primes as input. A more radical solution would be to change the classical QuaternionAlgebra(D) to take a list of primes as input, but I guess that it could cause trouble.

Besides this, here are some remarks about the changes introduced in this commit:

- Line 245 of quaternion_algebra.py should be fixed, since it does not reflect the new input format.

- The documentation needs to take account of these changes; see lines 92-94, 605-607, 625 of quaternion_algebra.py and line 1835 of number_fields.py

- Line 589 of quaternion_algebra.py and lines 1804, 1815, 1817 of number_fields.py: shouldn't the name of the list of prime ideales be L or P instead of I?
