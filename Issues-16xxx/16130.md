Here is an instance of smallest failing example.

```
    sage: UCF.<E>=UniversalCyclotomicField()
    sage: MS=MatrixSpace(UCF,2,2)
    sage: bad_mat=MS([-4, 2*E(7)^6, -5*E(13)^3 + 5*E(13)^8 - 4*E(13)^9, 0]) #this matrix was obtained via random_element
    sage: bad_mat._echelon_classical()
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    [...]
    OverflowError: value too large to convert to int
    sage: bad_mat.inverse()
    Traceback (most recent call last)
    [...]
    NotImplementedError: value too large to convert to int
    Echelon form not implemented over 'Universal Cyclotomic Field'.
```

The error handling of inverse should be looked at to reflect the origin of the error. In this case, that the echelonize method converts to integers and therefore fails for too big denominators but is still implemented over Universal Cyclotomic Field. For example, the following case does work:

```
    sage: good_mat=MS([E(4), 0, -2*E(17)^2 - 4*E(17)^3, -2])
    sage: good_mat.echelon_form()
    [1 0]
    [0 1]
    sage: good_mat.inverse()
    [                -E(4)                     0]
    [E(68)^25 + 2*E(68)^29                  -1/2]
```

Hello,

In #18152, I reimplemented the universal cyclotomic field using libgap (faster and more reliable). In that version the issue disappears. My goal would be to close this ticket as "won't fix" as soon as #18152 would be reviewed.
