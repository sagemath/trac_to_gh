If the bug is in hypellfrob, we should ask David Harvey for help.
But David's code is usually bug free :)

Any clue on how rarely this happens?

The only sensible things coming to my mind without looking back at the code is that there is some issue with the sqrt code which surely uses some randomness.
Also note that the naive code currently used is rewritten in a much more proper way at #11980, so reviewing it might fix this issue.

I have no idea what the "latest NTL/Sage fixes" are, so I guess without.
