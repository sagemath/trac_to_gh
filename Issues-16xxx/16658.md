This is quite slow on bsd, done 200 iterations in one Sage interactive session and no failures yet.
Any clue on how rarely this happens?

The only sensible things coming to my mind without looking back at the code is that there is some issue with the sqrt code which surely uses some randomness.
Also note that the naive code currently used is rewritten in a much more proper way at #11980, so reviewing it might fix this issue.
