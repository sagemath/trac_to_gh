The write() function does return nothing in Py2

```
>>> sys.version
'2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: f.write("boo")
... 
>>> 
```
while in Py3 it returns the number of bytes written

```
>>> sys.version
'3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: f.write("boo")
... 
3
>>> 
```
This can be unified by adding something like `ignore =`

```
>>> sys.version
'3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> with open("tracked", "w") as f: ignore = f.write("boo")
... 
>>> 
```
About 79 py module are effected.
