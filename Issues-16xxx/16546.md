```
Given an instance of MSNC problem (a directed acyclic graph, a set of source nodes, a set of sink nodes, each source node having a source message and each sink node wanting a subset of source messages), use single element linear extensions of matroids to enumerate the non-isomorphic codes satisfying network constraints on the rank function with following additional options:
1) Compute the rate region (set of all rate tuples) achievable over given finite field via scalar linear codes
2) Construct scalar linear codes for achieving a given point in the rate region (thereby determining scalar linear solvability of a network and the property of being matroidal over a certain field)

+Given an instance of MSNC problem (a directed acyclic graph, a set of source nodes, a set of sink nodes, each source node having a source message and each sink node wanting a subset of source messages). Use single element linear extensions of matroids to enumerate the codes satisfying network constraints on the rank function with following additional options:
+1) Compute the rate region (set of all rate tuples) achievable over given finite field via scalar linear codes
+2) Construct scalar linear codes for achieving a given point in the rate region (thereby determining scalar linear solvability of a network and the property of being matroidal over a certain field)
