<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In preparing the new database file (the file cremona.db in SAGE_ROOT/local/share/cremona) which is done using the command sage.databases.cremona.build() on the updated tar file I find that I have to change that script, because I have "tidied up" the file structure in the tarball so that the data files are in subdirectories.

It seems sensible to make those changes in the same branch as the ones for the new spkg (updating package version and checksums).

If the new spkg works OK I think that will be good evidence for the new cremona.db file being good.
