```
Currently we have

```
sage: P = Poset([[],[[0,1]]])
sage: Q = Poset([[],[[0,2]]])
sage: R = Q.canonical_label()
sage: P.hasse_diagram() == R.hasse_diagram()
True
sage: list(P) == list(R)
True
sage: P.cover_relations() == R.cover_relations()
True
sage: P is R
False
sage: P == R
False
```
The issue is that `FinitePoset` doesn't parse the arguments to a standard form as much as it should.

Possibly related to #14019, which "will be fixed in one month" 18 months ago. Also, who in their right minds designs a UniqueRepresentation class with an inplace relabel method ? (i.e. not immutable)
