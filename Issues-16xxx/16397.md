```
In the symbolic ring, cmp implements the print comparison which is probably not what you envisioned:

```
sage: cmp(1, sqrt(2))     # mathematically correct, uses rich comparison
-1
sage: cmp(SR(1), sqrt(2)) # unexpectedly, you get the print sort order
1
sage: cmp(log(8), 3*log(2))
-1
```
Everybody who coerces to same parents internally before comparing trips over this, for example the real lazy field:

```
sage: RLF(1) < RLF(sqrt(2))
False
```
This also makes `RealSet` unusable with symbolics:

```
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[pi, pi],(pi,4))
[pi, 4)
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[0, pi],(pi,4))
[pi, 4)
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[0, 3.5],(pi,4))
(pi, 4)
```

Do I understand it right that this should call `math_sorted` instead of `cmp`?

You probably mean https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/sage-devel/cmp/sage-devel/092yBmHfXQo/4qfS_JHLJdwJ and #16537, #17175. The newsgroup thread is mainly about equality/hashing and a bit of richcmp, not the two choices above. I am just starting to read about this.

The newest verson of #19040 is in the `u/rws/19312-1` branch of #19312

So, the way to resolve this IMO would be to
1. merge #19312
2. merge #19040 using the `u/rws/19312-1` branch of #19312
3. using `__nonzero__` to implement `__cmp__`

It is needed because `cmp` is used in Sage to sort expressions in a meaningful way, contrary to what you state.

It will never be *correct* in the sense that you can rely on it in mathematical algorithms, since the zero test for constant symbolic expressions is undecidable. At best it will be a nice and natural print order. Which is not a bad thing, but I don't understand if that's the goal of this ticket (and, if not, what the goal is).
