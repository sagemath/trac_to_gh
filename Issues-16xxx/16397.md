}
```
In the symbolic ring, cmp implements the print comparison which is probably not what you envisioned:

```
sage: cmp(1, sqrt(2))     # mathematically correct, uses rich comparison
-1
sage: cmp(SR(1), sqrt(2)) # unexpectedly, you get the print sort order
1
sage: cmp(log(8), 3*log(2))
-1
```
Everybody who coerces to same parents internally before comparing trips over this, for example the real lazy field:

```
sage: RLF(1) < RLF(sqrt(2))
False
```
This also makes `RealSet` unusable with symbolics:

```
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[pi, pi],(pi,4))
[pi, 4)
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[0, pi],(pi,4))
[pi, 4)
sage: RealSet((0, pi),[0, 3.5],(pi,4))
(pi, 4)
```

<a id='comment:20'></a>The newest verson of #19040 is in the `u/rws/19312-1` branch of #19312

So, the way to resolve this IMO would be to
1. merge #19312
2. merge #19040 using the `u/rws/19312-1` branch of #19312
3. using `__nonzero__` to implement `__cmp__`

$ python
>>> from math import exp, pi, sqrt
>>> exp(pi*sqrt(163)) == 262537412640768256
True
```
comes to mind. But I agree that this could be tackled on a future ticket.

It is needed because `cmp` is used in Sage to sort expressions in a meaningful way, contrary to what you state.

I'm not saying that it is not used that way, I am saying that, as far as I understand, when it is used that way, the bug is there.

I don't know. I tried to explain what I *believe* is the convention used in sage (or perhaps the most reasonable of several incompatible conventions currently in use), but I'm genuinely interested in knowing if other people agree.
