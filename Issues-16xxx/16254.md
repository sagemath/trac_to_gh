final_word_out is used in subsequential transducers. A transducer is said to be subsequential if it is deterministic, every state is final and it has a final output word for each final state, i.e., when reading an input and reaching some final state along some path, then the final output word of this state is appended to the output labels collected along the path.

This will facilitate various transducers, e.g., when we currently have to read a sufficiently large number of zeros in order to flush some more output. 

In the following functions, final_word_out is now implemented:

* `FiniteStateMachine.composition`: If the output of one finite state machine is used as input of another one, then also the final output word of the first one is fed into the second one.
* `FiniteStateMachine.output_projection`: If the automaton which recognizes the output of a transducer is constructed, then the final output word has to be the last part of a recognized input. This is implemented by constructing a new final state and adding one transition for each final output word of the original transducer. The original final states are not final anymore.
* `FiniteStateMachine.prepone_output`: Here, final output words have to be considered like any other transition leaving a state.
* `FiniteStateMachine.product_FiniteStateMachine`: A function which handles the combination of final output words is required if there exists non-trivial final output words.
* `Transducer.cartesian_product`: The final output words of the new transducer consists of pairs of final output words of the original transducers.
