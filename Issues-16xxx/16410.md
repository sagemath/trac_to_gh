```
From the discussions of (TODO: add refs to the threads in sage-devel),
there is a consensus that, at this point, the `combinatorial_map`
decorator should by default return the decorated method as is, in
order to have no impact on speed. On the other hand, projects built on
top of Sage, like findstat are welcome to customize locally this hook to instrument
the Sage code and exploit the semantic information provided by this
decorator.

This ticket therefore:
- Defines `combinatorial_map` as a no-op
- Discuss the purpose of this decorator
- Uses the previous implementation as an example of how to customize
  `combinatorial_map`

Note: this change is slightly backward incompatible since `combinatorial_maps_in_class` is not functional any more by default.

Hi Nicolas,

I do not like the fact that in order to use combinatorial maps we need to modify the source code. The decorator is executed when the source code is loaded, hence on startup. Turning it on inside a console would just be a nightmare. This is a killer strategy: you simply removed combinatorial maps from being usable.

On the other hand, this ticket can be reviewed quickly compared to #16408 (which needs some design discussions). We can let this one go and then start discussing #16408 but I think we need more opinions on this.

Thanks

I agree, it's unusable from a plain Sage. But it remains usable by
findstat and friends which, as far as I know, are the only serious use
cases so far, while removing the primary gripe against
`combinatorial_map`.

Note: if we really care about keeping `combinatorial_maps_in_class` in
working state because some people might have been using, we could, as
a temporary trick, have the decorator do
'f._is_combinatorial_map=True` before returning f, and have
`combinatorial_maps_in_class` check for this attribute.

Precisely :-)

By the way: how bad is it to merge this on into #16408? I am sorry to
be getting in your way ...

It would be nothing to adapt #16408 (what I have done is only a draft experimentation). So it is not an argument against this ticket. But, I do not see the emergency of getting rid of `combinatorial_map` (we are in early beta so we have time to think for the next stable).

There is no emergency - but I do think at this point it would be better to actually completely remove `combinatorial_map`. For us, it was **never** important to have the decorator in public Sage, and I regret to have ever sent it since it turned out to be just a big waste of energy. (But when I wrote that code, people agreed that they want to have it, and I have seen at least Anne S and Martin R using it).

Not having it there anymore opens more possibilities to think of what the right way to proceed is (then using #16408).

This ticket seems a good solution for the time being. It leaves here the semantic information that have been added by many users and fixes the issues of wrapping the methods with the decorator. 

I think we all agree this is not a long term solution but it will give us time to do things the right way on Vincent's ticket.

I see your point. From a social point we, as a community, screwed up:
finding an acceptable common ground for everyone should not have taken
more than a good one-hour brainstorm, and a couple of hours of
coding/reviewing. We had plenty of occasions for this! I am frustrated
myself about all the energy and hurt feelings we wasted there.

This does not necessarily mean, though, that this was not the right
thing to do technically speaking.

Anyway, whether `combinatorial_map` is the right long term approach or
not is orthogonal to this ticket.

Let's move on, focus on the technical solutions, and act together;
that's the best way to heal the community.

Cheers!
