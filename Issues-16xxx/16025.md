The `.n()` is dangerous, as it can give easily give false precision:

```
sage: Ei(1.1).n(300)
2.16737827956340289858871983597055077552795410156250000000000000000000000000000000000000000

sage: Ei(RealField(300)(1.1))
2.16737827956340282358378734233807621497112737591639704719499002090327541763352339357795426

sage: Ei(11/10).n(300)
2.16737827956340282358378734233807621497112737591639704719499002090327541763352339357795426
0394065907142504328679588538509331805598360907980986
```

The fact that several doctests in the Sage library have this error shows that this error is easily made.

Oh, dear.  This is because we auto-evaluate things with decimal points.

```
sage: Ei(1.1)
2.16737827956340
sage: Ei(1.1).n(300)
2.16737827956340289858871983597055077552795410156250000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
Not sure where those other things come from - floating point remains, I guess?  Especially since the last few digits are a power of two...

The `prec` deprecation was intended for things like 

```
sage: Ei(1)
Ei(1)
sage: Ei(1).n(300)
1.89511781635593675546652093433163426901706058173270759164622843188251383453380415354890071
```
but apparently the warning happens no matter what.  And if you read the warning closely (!):

```
Explicitly set the precision of the input, for example 
Ei(RealField(300)(1)), or use the prec argument to .n() for exact inputs, 
e.g., Ei(1).n(300), instead.
```
So ... are you asking for more clarification of this (which I would understand) or are you saying it is wrong?   `1.1` is not "exact" so the warning is telling us to explicitly set the precision of the input.  Maybe the example should be one that isn't exact, and say more about that being appropriate then?

I was just naively comparing and, frankly, I see no reason why we should surprise the user with

```
sage: Ei(1.1).n(300)
2.16737827956340289858871983597055077552795410156250000000000000000000000000000000000000000

```
Update:
Let's assume I accept the convention of 1.1 being auto-evaluated as 53-bit real, then I would expect a warning of some kind on the attempt of getting 300 bits of precision from it.

```
