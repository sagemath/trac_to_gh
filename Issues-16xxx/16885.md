Ticket #16681 pops up a strange error when doing factorization of polynomials over finite fields. The problem occurs when we repeatedly create finite fields of different degree and ask for factorization of some random polynomial in that field as in the example below

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(3),'T')
sage: for _ in xrange(5000):
....:    p = R.random_element(degree=(2,8))
....:    d = p.degree()
....:    if d <= 2: continue
....:    q = p.change_ring(GF(3**d, 'z'))
....:    assert q.factor().prod() == q, "problem with p={}".format(p)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: problem with p=T^4 + T^2
```

You can also have a look at the file [attachment:test_polynomials.py test_polynomials.py] which contains more precise output for the same tests.

basically printing what happens when PARI is called before the slightly modified Vincent output.

As you might see, the factorization at the end of the call to factor() in polynomial element is correct.
More precisely, the first two factors in the PARI factorization are the same as what we get back in Vincent's file in the Factorization object, but the third one Mod(Mod(1, 3), Mod(1, 3)*a^4 + Mod(2, 3)*a^3 + Mod(2, 3))*x + Mod(Mod(2, 3)*a^3 +
 Mod(2, 3)*a^2, Mod(1, 3)*a^4 + Mod(2, 3)*a^3 + Mod(2, 3)) = T + 2*z<sup>3+z</sup>2 does not appear there and the fourth one becomes the third one.
The fourth one (T + 2*z^2 + 2*z + 1) in Sage's Factorizaiton object is mysterious (and different from the one which disappeared from PARI fac object.

Something wrong happens in:

```
With further debugging, it seems doing that without R and int is fine, and putting R and int breaks some values in the list.

I am also getting failures with the following variant:

```python
while True:
    d = ZZ.random_element(2, 8)
    K = GF(3**d, 'a')
    R = PolynomialRing(K, 'x')
    f = R.random_element()
    pf = pari(f)
    pfl = pf.list()
    Kpfl = [K(c) for c in pfl]
    Rf = R(Kpfl)
    if f != Rf:
        print f, pf, pfl, Kpfl, Rf
        raise ValueError
```
The values in one particularly simple case are as follows (applied `lift(lift(...))` to PARI objects to make them readable):

```
f = a^3*x^2 + (a^3 + 2*a^2 + a)*x
pf = a^3*x^2 + (a^3 + 2*a^2 + a)*x
pfl = [0, a^3 + 2*a^2 + a, a^3]
Kpfl = [0, a^3 + 2*a^2 + a, a^3]
Rf = a^3*x^2 + (2*a^2 + 2*a + 2)*x
```
Everything is consistent up to the conversion of `Kpfl` (the list of coefficients) to a polynomial, where the coefficient `a^3 + 2*a^2 + a` changes into `2*a^2 + 2*a + 2`.

and running

```
while True:
    d = ZZ.random_element(2, 8)
    K = GF(3**d, 'a')
    R = PolynomialRing(K, 'x')
    f = R.random_element()
    l = [K(c) for c in f._pari_().list()]
    g = R(l)
```
I got the following kind of error

```
ERROR in Polynomial_ZZ_pEX constructor
call with args:
  x = [a^5 + a^4 + 2*a^3 + 2*a^2 + 2*a + 1, a^6 + 2*a^5 + a^4 + a^3 + 2*a^2 + 2*a + 1, a^6 + 2*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 2*a^3 + a^2 + 2]
  check = True
  is_gen = False
  construct = False
but got the result (a^6 + 2*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 2*a^3 + a^2 + 2)*x^2 + (2*a^5 + 2*a^4 + a^3 + a^2 + 2)*x + a^5 + a^4 + 2*a^3 + 2*a^2 + 2*a + 1
variables
  K = Finite Field in a of size 3^7
```

Might be related or not:
- if I replace `f._pari_().list()` with `list(f._pari_())` in the code above then the RAM just fill in few seconds
- if I replace `f._pari_().list()` with `f.list()` then I do not see error anymore

I suspected something with NTL and contexts wrongly restored at some point but did not investigate far enough and thought "well it doesn't seem NTL is used that much in the problematic code, just PARI and factorization".
But with your info it seems it might indeed be some problem with NTL contexts restoration (at the C++ level).
I'll try to track it down.
