Nice work!

Some immediate comments:

* In `monic_integral_model`,

```
        - ``names`` -- a string, a tuple of up to two strings, or ``None``
          (default: ``None``), the name of the generator of the field, and
          the name of the generator of the underlying rational function
          field (if a tuple); if ``None``, then the names are chosen
          automatically.
```
This is correct. But following usual practice, you can omit `or ``None``` and instead of `if ``None```, you can write `if not given` in a friendly way. The same comment applies in other places.

* In `_simple_model`: Although this is a helper method, the docstring is better to start with `Return ...`-style sentence.

* In `ALGORITHM`: You write `Indeed, suppose for contradiction that for all `i` we had `N_i\neq M``. Here you do not seek for a contradiction because you directly show it. You have `Then `N_i=N_j` for some `i,j`.` not because of supposing that but because there are only finitely many intermediate fields, as you mentioned above.

* In `REFERENCES`: I am not sure about this myself. But as far as I know, the policy changed, and we should place all references in a central reference file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`

* In `_simple_model`: A small optimization is to move out `M.degree()*L.degree()` from the `while` loop, and multiply `x_pow`  by `x` instead of `x**exponet`. But these things could make not much difference. It is up to your discretion :-)

Fixed all the occurences I could find.

I don't think that it will make enough of a difference, so I left it as it is.

Some quick notes:

(1) `Unless ...` should be `unless` as the sentence is connected with the previous one.

(2) To clarify, how about this?

```
if names:
    if not isinstance(names, tuple):
        names = (names,)
    if len(names) > 2:
        raise ValueError("names must contain at most 2 entries")
```
Also note erorr in `ValueError`.

(3) Is it necessary to check zero-length tuple? That is just a wrong input by the user.

```
if names is None or names == ():
```
Then how about just this: `if not names:`

(4) In the `INPUT:` block in `matrix()` method, I think
`a function field (default: ``None``); ...` is clear enough.
