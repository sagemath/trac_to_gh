Adds a new spkg containing the plantri program.

To use it in Sage, run the following in a terminal:

```
sage -i plantri
```

The tarball is located at http://www.nvcleemp.be/plantri-4.5.tar.bz2

Another ticket will handle the implementation of the methods calling plantri. See #17344.

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hellooooooooo !

Several comments about this branch:

- `def plane_graphs` -> `def planar_graphs` ?

- `Return a generator which creates general plane graphs using the plantri generator (see [plantri]_)` --> `An iterator over planar graphs using the plantri generator` ? It makes it more clear that they are not just 'some planar graphs' but 'all planar graphs' corresponding to the constraints. Also we try to keep the first line of doc in a function rather short, so the reference can appear later.

- You should add the new functions to the documentation at the head of `graph_generators.py` to let everybody know that they exist.

- There seems to be a lot of copy/paste in the three functions. Is there any reason why they should not all call `planar_graphs` which would do the parsing ?

- Could you mention that plantri is an optional package and that it has to be installed first if it is to work at all ? Actually, you can even try to check first if the package is installed, and raise a useful exception otherwise "i.e. --> install it"

Thanks for this work ! It will be useful to many people I hope `:-)`

<a id='comment:11'></a>Hi

Thanks for the feedback.

The documentation is currently being extended, but I'm travelling at the moment so I didn't get as far with this ticket as I hoped to have.

I thought about making it just one function, but thought that it would make the meaning of the arguments less obvious to users. Of course, you could just add an argument `triangulations` and `quadrangulations`, but I think that having separate methods is a cleaner solution. I could add a helper function to which the three functions dispatch to factor out the common code.

Normally the code already checks that the package is installed. I will add that the package is optional.

Concerning the name. Since also graphs with a connectivity lower than 3 can be generated, this function really generates plane graphs, i.e., planar graphs together with an embedding, and not just planar graphs. The graphs are generated up to isomorphism of the plane graph.

Oh I see I see, I had not even noticed that the ticket was not in `needs_review`. Sorry for interrupting.

Nononnono I agree with that, the four functions are fine ! I was only talking about the code: why wouldn't the first function call the other ones so that there is no duplication of code ?

Oh, do you mean that the function will output all different embeddings of non-3-connected planar graphs ? If so that's worth a note/warning in the doc !

I am still a bit troubled by this distinction between "plane graphs" and "planar graphs". Especially when the website of plantri/fullgen reads "planar graph" everywhere.

That's true. I'll have a look at fixing that.

Yes, it will do that.

Yes, I know. I actually don't know which notation Brendan uses, but I at least know that Gunnar is quite adamant about the distinction. I think they just never got around to changing it from the original wording.

But I can live with planar_graphs if it is noted clearly that for non-3-connected graphs each distinct planar embedding will be output.

At the moment I'm too jet-lagged to risk writing any code. (Unless you want some extra work as a reviewer ;-)) I'll continue work on this ticket soon.

<a id='comment:18'></a>> I had a look at factoring out common code. The problem is that although it looks like there is a lot of common code, the exact values that determine a valid input are different for each case. Internally `plantri` also uses separate logics for each case. If somebody sees a way to factor out all this logic, then I am curious to hear it! :-)


Well I gave it a try because I really did not like to see the same lines in different functions (like n<64, ...) but after having begun to do the job, I am convinced that having all the logic in one function does not make the code much clearer. Soooooo Well, you are right, let us keep it like that !

Do you have anything left to do with the code or is it in `needs_review` ?

<a id='comment:20'></a>Helloooooooooo !

Okay, I just spent some time re-re-re-reading your code, to get to the very obvious conclusion that it is very very clean.

I added a small commit on top of yours that does simple things:

- Length of the lines in the SPKG.txt file
- All functions should begin with a short line describing their job
- Refactored several 'if'
- I never know what "between 1 and 5" means (strict or not ?) so I replaced it with `\geq` and `\leq`.
- Added some missing `# optional - plantri` that would have made it break on machines on which the package is not installed.

Very good work. Thank a lot !

Nathann

<a id='comment:21'></a>Hi

I had a look at your commits. Everything still works and I learned some new style guide lines for Sage. ;-)

Set to `positive_review`.

Looking forward to have this in Sage (without having to pull this branch). :-)
