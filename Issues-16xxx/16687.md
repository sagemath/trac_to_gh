<a id='comment:1'></a>These are stand-alone programs, written in gp. The natural way of running them within a process would be by giving them each their own "pari" instance (is that possible?), possibly even a fresh one for each run. Is starting/stopping a pari instance cheaper than starting a new gp process?

It may of course be possible to use these programs as gp/pari "libraries", possibly not even clashing ones, but that might need significant modifications to the programs.

It should be possible to run those GP scripts within the PARI library in Sage but the main issue I see is that some of these scripts use global variables and GP lacks namespaces.
