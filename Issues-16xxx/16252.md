Most of the doctests in oeis are broken (as the database has been updated).

To run the test do

```
./sage -t --optional=sage,internet SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```

Have the keywords changed again `...,'nice', 'hear', 'changed')`? Then one could consider this test as brittle :-/


And the statement `Created new window in existing browser session.` is true - while not expected. It opened `http://oeis.org/A000045` a new tab in Chromium (ubuntu 14.04)

Hi Wilfried,

Thanks for looking at this.

I modified a bit the first test in order to make it more robust to small changes in the database. I do not understand what happened with the second one. Only the method `browse` and `links` should open some windows in your browser. Could you try again?

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

the first failure is gone - the second not.

I replaced `45` by `10` in line 1645 (doctest of `browse()` and got 

```
File "src/sage/databases/oeis.py", line 1645, in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.browse
Failed example:
    f = oeis(10) ; f                      # optional -- internet, webbrowser
Expected:
    A000045: Fibonacci numbers: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
Got:
    A000010: Euler totient function phi(n): count numbers <= n and prime to n.
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/databases/oeis.py", line 1735, in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.programs
Failed example:
    ee = oeis('A001113') ; ee             # optional -- internet
Expected:
    A001113: Decimal expansion of e.
Got:
    Created new window in existing browser session.
    A001113: Decimal expansion of e.
**********************************************************************
2 items had failures:
   1 of   3 in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.browse
   1 of   7 in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.programs
    [261 tests, 2 failures, 71.93 s]
```
Now the first failure is expected. My browser opened `http://oeis.org/A000010`.
This seems to indicate that the new message `Created new ...` is left over by the doctest of browse(). But why? Don't you see this behavior?

This is what I get in a terminal

```
sage: import sage.databases.o
sage.databases.odlyzko  sage.databases.oeis     
sage: import sage.databases.oeis
sage: f = oeis(1)
sage: f
A000001: Number of groups of order n.
sage: f.browse()
sage: Created new window in existing browser session.

sage: f.show()
ID
A000001
```
After `sage: Created new window in existing browser session.` I had to press ENTER to  see the `sage:` prompt again.

The doctest failure is likely environment dependent:


The module `webbrowser` is a Python standard module. It use some logic to select a suitable browser and calls it with `subprocess.Popen()`. The message `Created new ...` is issued by Chromium (revealed be a Google search :-).

Today I closed my Chromium *Version 34.0.1847.116 Ubuntu 14.04 aura (260972)* before starting the test. The result:

```
File "src/sage/databases/oeis.py", line 1735, in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.programs
Failed example:
    ee = oeis('A001113') ; ee             # optional -- internet
Expected:
    A001113: Decimal expansion of e.
Got:
    ATTENTION: default value of option force_s3tc_enable overridden by environment.
    [12960:12960:0505/151917:ERROR:sandbox_linux.cc(268)] InitializeSandbox() called with multiple threads in process gpu-process
    A001113: Decimal expansion of e.
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   7 in sage.databases.oeis.OEISSequence.programs
    [261 tests, 1 failure, 78.67 s]
```
So there are environments (e.g. mine) that can produce some unexpected browser output.

At last I got `All tests passed!` with 

```
            sage: ee = oeis('A001113') ; ee             # optional -- internet
            Created new window in existing browser session.
            A001113: Decimal expansion of e.
```
But this is not really a solution :-((

Hi,

I do have a problem since the line

```
sage: ee = oeis('A001113')
```
does not call webbrowser. It is only the following that does

```
sage: ee.browse()
```
Hence I do not really understand what happens on your computer (even if it is now clear that it depends on the browser).

Maybe there is a way to turn off the writing of the subprocess on stdout/stderr... I will dig in. There are partial answers on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1352361/suppress-redirect-stderr-when-calling-python-webrowser) but which are plateform and installation dependent... but it is better than nothing!

Hi Vincent, 

the browser is called in a doctest of `browse()` in line 1645 `sage: f = oeis(45) ; f`. 

This can be seen in my comment 5 where I changed `oeis(45)` to `oeis(10)`. The browser opened A000010. The message from Chromium then surfaced in the other (later) doctest from line 1735.

Maybe this is (one more) hint that *some* test are better suited for a testing framework like [nose](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/1.3.2) or [py.test](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest/2.5.2). But that's a whole new story ...

Hi,

There was a typo in the documentation. In order to skip the doctest one should write

```
sage: f.browse() # optional -- internet webbrowser
```
and not

```
sage: f.browse() # optional -- internet, webbrowser
```

I did the correction in the last commit. Could you try again? You should get no error with

```
./sage -t --optional=sage,internet SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```
but might get one with

```
./sage -t --optional=sage,internet,webbrowser SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```

Hi,

i am a bit lost with the new framework, how it is possible that this ticket get positive review while  #14567 is not settled ?

Could it be better to fix OEIS-changes in a self-contained ticket, and continued_fractions changes (even in oeis.py) in the other one ?

Hi Thierry,

In the current state, this one will wait until #14567 gets reviewed. If there are some changes in #14567 then either there is a trivial merge and everything is fine, or the merge is non trivial and it will need another (short) review.

It might be better that #14567 gets reviewed... if you want to fix this one independently of #14567, it is up to you.

While focusing on the doctest failures in `oeis.py` I missed the on dependency #14567 (and that the patch contained much more than `oeis.py`).

Therefore I think this ticket should stay with *needs review* until #14567 is positive. Then I will review this again :-)

Meanwhile I discovered some more optional doctest failures (#16302) ...

Concerning workaround doctests that are robust to database changes.

The "doc" part of the doctest is important too. As you can check, most failed doctests are designed to be examples for the user. I think the user should be exposed to what she will actually get, even if there is some small noise in the result, humans can adapt to such noise, and they need examples.

We are not, the users are able to understand the examples even if they slightly differ from what they will get by testing themselves. In my opinion, those should be updated from time to time but there is no hurry to be on the edge, it is not like openssl or so.

I am -1 to run the internet doctests by default, or we are going to flood OEIS servers for almost no benefit. Actually, this is why a fake OEIS entry is hardcoded in the file (those tests are run everytime).

The robustness can be achieved as follows : run internet doctests once before a release and fix them if they are severe (e.g. change in the database structure, change in the URL scheme).

To complement Vincent's answer, there is a semantic issue in using `ContinuedFractionField()`.

The problem is that most (if not all) continued fractions in OEIS corrrespond to irrational numbers (OEIS is not much about periodic sequences), so a parent modelling the rationals is not appropriate, even if we only have the fist few partial coefficients (like elements of `RDF` are rationals but do not represent rational numbers). Perhaps should we use `type` instead of `parent` here (i used `parent` to be consistent with other cases) ?

Actually, i am planning to plug infinite sequences implemented in Sage with oeis calss (e.g. Fibonacci), so that we could ask for arbitrary many partial coefficients for the related continued fraction, not only those provided by `.first_terms()` method.

Of course there has to be a balance, but I don't know of any examples where we intentionally allow failed doctests for the sake of this balance. Instead, it is often possible to write doctests which are both illustrative and correct.

According to everything I know about Sage's doctesting, there is no tolerance for failed doctests. We don't fix them only if they are severe.

The problem is that those doctests have a role of documentation, not test. They are an illustration of some mathematical concept, hence the actual text is important. In the last commit, the oeis calls are supposed to illustrate things about:

- Genus of modular group Gamma_0(n),
- Motzkin numbers,
- species of simple graphs,
- Coefficients of a Bessel function,

not about testing Sage/oeis features, so writing indirect doctests that will not show the results provided by the OEIS database might not be interesting.

Then add a `# random` flag at the end of those lines, so that the tests do not break so often. And where you actually need to test something, add it in a TEST section where you can be as unclear as you want to test what you want to test (as you don't need to be understood by a newcomer), so that what should be tested is tested.

The tests do not break at all thanks to the `# internet` flag, which is not turned on by default. It has the same effect than `# random` except that we can run them from time to time to check/update.

No, it has not. It gives you a way to have a clean documentation that is helpful to the users even if the remote database changes, and it gives you a way to write consistent tests why will not break even if the database changes.

I do not care at all if you like to write broken test and to fix them every two months. I just mentionned a way to do the job properly, and I will not fight with you if you do not care. Have fun fixing them again in 6 months.
