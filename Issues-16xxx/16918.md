Ends with:

```
checking for suffix of object files... configure: error: in `/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gcc-4.7.3.p1/gcc-build/armv7l-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/libgcc':
configure: error: cannot compute suffix of object files: cannot compile
```
Hence there won't be any arm binaries. Which probably wouldn't be that useful anyway since there is a lot of hardware variation in the field.

gcc 4.8.2 does build cleanly on this machine.
I have it in `/home/dimpase/bin/gcc`.
It also builds Sage well.
So one way might be to have an experimental spkg with this gcc and 
ship it this way.
