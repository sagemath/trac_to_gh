Hence there won't be any arm binaries. Which probably wouldn't be that useful anyway since there is a lot of hardware variation in the field.

gcc 4.8.2 does build cleanly on this machine.
I have it in `/home/dimpase/bin/gcc`.
It also builds Sage well.
So one way might be to have an experimental spkg with this gcc and 
ship it this way.
