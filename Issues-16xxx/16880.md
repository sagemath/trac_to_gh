In this ticket we add three methods to integers: `previous_prime` (calling pari `precprime`), `next_prime_power` and `previous_prime_power`. We also make changes in `sage.rings.arith` to call these (faster) methods.

Timings on the current version (sage-6.7.beta2)

```
sage: timeit("for i in range(200): next_prime_power(i)", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 311 µs per loop
sage: a = 33622489
sage: timeit("next_prime_power(a)", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 53.6 µs per loop
```

Timings with the branch applied

```
sage: timeit("for i in range(200): next_prime_power(i)", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 184 µs per loop
sage: a = 33622489
sage: timeit("next_prime_power(a)", number=5000, repeat=10)
5000 loops, best of 10: 16.9 µs per loop
```

I would instead check if `mpz_sizeinbase(n.value, 2)` increases during the loop. In that case, we know that we skipped a power of 2.

I used `mpz_tstbit` instead. Should be the fastest.

Potential micro optimization that would need to use `mpn_*` functions
- the call to `mpz_sizeinbase` can be replaced by `mpn_count_leading_zeros` and some arithmetic
- we can avoid a useless bit shift in `mpz_tstbit` by only considering the `&` with the most significant limb. Moreover, the allocation of the limbs will not change inside the loop. So we can already use the good pointer to the concerned limb.

I think this is too much for a naive algorithm...

<a id='comment:24'></a>`skept` -> `skipped`

This should be moved *after* the comparison with 2 (and `self` should be compared with 2):

```
cdef Integer n = PY_NEW(Integer)
```

Another simplification that I missed: you can skip the block

```
    if mpz_even_p(n.value):
    if n.is_prime_power(proof=proof):
    return n
    mpz_add_ui(n.value, n.value, 1)
```
if you instead just add 2 if `self` was odd:

```
mpz_add_ui(n.value, self.value, 1 if mpz_even_p(self.value) else 2)
```

Then the `bit_index` should be based on the value of `self`, such that the check works correctly if `self` was `2^n - 1`.
