Sage is mainly hit by
* the renaming of the Py2 module `__builtin__` into `builtins` in Py3. (#20694 and #20713)

Others are e.g.
* `cPickle` #21225
* `copy_reg` #21115
* `StringIO` and `cStringIO` #21150
* `httplib` #20957

The tool 2to3 renames the modules. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 39 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.
