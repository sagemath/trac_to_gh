When the OA library will be more "research-level" and everything why not, but for the moment there is not much to play with the OA themselves or do anything with them. We just generate those which exist.

I was somehow convinced that I had written another commit that needed this function too, but I don't seem to find it again. I hope I did not lose it anywhere or filed it in the wrong "component".
