In sympy the solution of Diophantine equations is available for several types of equations (http://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/solvers/diophantine.html). This meta-ticket aims at

* implementing a global `solve_diophantine()` function that wraps the sympy functionality and takes
  1. symbolic expressions (up to order 2)
  2. univariate polynomials (up to order 2)
  3. multivariate polynomials (up to order 2)
  4. quadratic forms
* where useful implementing member functions `solve_diophantine()`

It is however not possible to directly make the resp. sympy functions fully usable with Sage, from within Sage. If desired that must be done in sympy.

Until then there is the following workaround:

```
sage: from sympy.solvers.diophantine import *
sage: from sympy import sympify
sage: var('x,y,m')
(x, y, m)
sage: diop_solve(sympify(x**2 + y**2 - 5))
{(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (2, -1), (2, 1)}
sage: diop_solve(sympify(x**2 - 3*y**2 - 1))
{(-sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3) + 2)**t/2 + (-sqrt(3) + 2)**t + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3) + 2)**t/2 + (sqrt(3) + 2)**t,
  -sqrt(3)*(-sqrt(3) + 2)**t/3 + (-sqrt(3) + 2)**t/2 + (sqrt(3) + 2)**t/2 + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3) + 2)**t/3)}
```

Solve with assumption `'integer'` for all variables should definitely call `diop_solve()`, but also the shorter `solve_diophantine(expr)` without assumptions should be available. Not sure what the output of `[1]` above means.

OK, so this ticket is really an interface to Sympy code and all the tests pass. 

A suggestion that you might want to consider: Pell's equation is in no reasonable sense a correct attribution. I would prefer Brahmagupta-Pell equation. For historic comments, see A. Weil's book "Number Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre" or Whitford's book "Pell's equation" for some of the early history. 

Modulo this, positive review.
