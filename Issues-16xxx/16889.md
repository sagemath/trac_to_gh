```
The doctesting framework should ignore whitespace before numbers and between the sign and the number when testing with `(abs|rel) tol`. There are two reasons why:

1. The spacing of matrices is unpredictable. You could have

```
[1.0 0.0]
[1.0 0.0]
```
vs

```
[0.999999 0.0]
[     1.0 0.0]
```
Note the added space between `[` and `1.0`.

2. Complex numbers or polynomials

```
1.0 + 1e-16*I
```
vs

```
1.0 - 1e-16*I
```
Here you want to compare ` + 1e-16` and ` - 1e-16` with the sign for your tolerance computations.

After some consideration, I decided it actually makes a lot of sense to use interval arithmetic for doctest tolerances, this is implemented on this ticket.

Yes, that would be good. However, note that Sage itself actually formats the results as in my patch, with one value per line.

ok, however in our book we allow ourselves not to follow 100% the Sage output format, up to spaces
