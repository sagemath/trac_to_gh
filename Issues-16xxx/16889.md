}
```
The doctesting framework should ignore whitespace before numbers and between the sign and the number when testing with `(abs|rel) tol`. There are two reasons why:

1. The spacing of matrices is unpredictable. You could have

```
[1.0 0.0]
[1.0 0.0]
```
vs

```
[0.999999 0.0]
[     1.0 0.0]
```
Note the added space between `[` and `1.0`.

2. Complex numbers or polynomials

```
1.0 + 1e-16*I
```
vs

```
1.0 - 1e-16*I
```
Here you want to compare ` + 1e-16` and ` - 1e-16` with the sign for your tolerance computations.

After some consideration, I decided it actually makes a lot of sense to use interval arithmetic for doctest tolerances, this is implemented on this ticket.

which uses the same number of lines, and should not make any overfull hbox.
Is that ok?
