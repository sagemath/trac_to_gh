There is a flaw in the prev() method in combinat/permutation.py.
Here is an example.

```
sage: Permutation([1,4,3,2]).prev()
[1, 2, 4, 3]
```

The output should be [1, 4, 2, 3].

One line modification!! great!

- What about `range(n-2,-1,-1)` instead of `reversed(range(0,n-1))`?

- I really would like to see random tests that would prevent this kind of things happening again

```
sage: for _ in range(20):
....:     p = Permutations(randint(2,10)).random_element()
....:     assert p.next().prev() == p, "problem with p={}".format(p)
....:     assert p.prev().next() == p, "problem with p={}".format(p)
```

+1 as when we switch to python3, the former should be faster (it should be a hair faster right now anyways).

I don't like randomized testing, as errors may not be noticed from the testing. So a feature gets into Sage which then causes (random) doctest failures on a clean build.

I prefer the latter because it's less error-prone and there is almost no difference in speed

```
$ python3 -m timeit -n 100 'for i in reversed(range(100000)): continue'
100 loops, best of 3: 3.54 msec per loop
$ python3 -m timeit -n 100 'for i in range(99999,-1,-1): continue'
100 loops, best of 3: 3.55 msec per loop

Nope. Reversed is an iterator (whose first purpose is to call `__reversed__` on your object). And Python lists have a special reversed iterator which is as fast as the forward one:

```
sage: reversed([1,2,3])
<listreverseiterator at 0x7f42249324d0>

Hi ayyer,

It would be cool to put your name on the wiki page [http://trac.sagemath.org](http://trac.sagemath.org). That way we can use your first name (or alias) for communication.

I guess that you used an old version of Sage. In order to rebuild sage it is **not** enough to do `sage -b`. You need to go to your `$SAGE_ROOT` directory and do `make`. As you see from your traceback, you have trouble with pari. The thing is that the pari package has been updated in sage.6.4.beta2 which is precisely the version on which the branch ` u/aapitzsch/ticket/16913` is based on.

If you have trouble with building Sage it is better to post on the [sage-devel mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel). You might find answers to your question in previous post and your questions might be useful for others as well.

Best
Vincent
