[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23596/) suggests we need more documentation on how to change ticks for only one axis.  One suggested example is

```
xx = np.logspace(1,100,1000) 
yy = np.linspace(-180,180,1000) 
list_plot(xx,yy,scale=semilogx,ticks=[None, 30])
```
though neither of us has tested this yet.

I was unable to get the suggested example to work, as i get this error when trying it: 

```
TypeError: The second argument 'plotjoined' should be boolean (True or False).  
If you meant to plot two lists 'x' and 'y' against each other, 
use 'list_plot(zip(x,y))'.
```

Also i needed to add single quotes around semilogx, so i ended up with this:

```
list_plot(zip(xx,yy),scale='semilogx',ticks=[None, Integer(30)])
```

And it produces a plot successfully, but i have no idea if that plot is correct, now with these changes?

I added an example to `plot` where only one axis is changed.

I would redirect to `plot` instead of `show` since `show` does more than `plot`. `plot` returns a plot object, whereas `show` returns `None` and displays a plot. In an analogy, `plot` is like a function that returns a string, whereas `show` is like `print`.

You should always try to base things off `develop` as it is far less likely to have any merge conflicts or behavior changes.

We've been putting white space between the arguments of Sage commands but not within the arguments. The command

```
plot(x^2,(x,300,500),ticks=[100,50000])
```

reads better as

```
plot(x^2, (x,300,500), ticks=[100,50000])
```

Please make that change in the immediate section on which you're working. Thanks!

You aren't required to merge the current develop branch if it doesn't affect your code. Some people do that regularly to avoid possible merge conflicts and to decrease the time it takes to rebuild after changes. I personally don't because it complicates the history of a branch in the Git repository, and rebuild time can be decreased significantly in any case by installing `ccache`.

You also don't need to include a patch with all changes. The commits to Git are cumulative, and you can see the total result by clicking on the branch at the top of this ticket.
