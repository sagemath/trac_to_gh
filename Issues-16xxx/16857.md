[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23596/) suggests we need more documentation on how to change ticks for only one axis.  One suggested example is

```
xx = np.logspace(1,100,1000) 
yy = np.linspace(-180,180,1000) 
list_plot(xx,yy,scale=semilogx,ticks=[None, 30])
```
though neither of us has tested this yet.

I was unable to get the suggested example to work, as i get this error when trying it: 

```
TypeError: The second argument 'plotjoined' should be boolean (True or False).  
If you meant to plot two lists 'x' and 'y' against each other, 
use 'list_plot(zip(x,y))'.
```

Also i needed to add single quotes around semilogx, so i ended up with this:

```
list_plot(zip(xx,yy),scale='semilogx',ticks=[None, Integer(30)])
```

And it produces a plot successfully, but i have no idea if that plot is correct, now with these changes?

I added an example to `plot` where only one axis is changed.
Since `list_plot` has no other examples with keywords, I decided to just add a reference to `show` there rather than adding the same example in two places.
All the other plot functions also makes references to [show](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot) or [plot](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show) for full details.

I realized now that I branched from `develop`, is this OK? Should I branch from `master` instead?

I would redirect to `plot` instead of `show` since `show` does more than `plot`. `plot` returns a plot object, whereas `show` returns `None` and displays a plot. In an analogy, `plot` is like a function that returns a string, whereas `show` is like `print`.

You should always try to base things off `develop` as it is far less likely to have any merge conflicts or behavior changes.

We've been putting white space between the arguments of Sage commands but not within the arguments. The command

```
plot(x^2,(x,300,500),ticks=[100,50000])
```

reads better as

```
plot(x^2, (x,300,500), ticks=[100,50000])
```

Please make that change in the immediate section on which you're working. Thanks!

Lennart, when I asked you to add yourself to authors I meant on the Trac ticket, not in the documentation.

One more change I would like to see it four instances of `1,27` changed to `1, 27`. Thanks!
