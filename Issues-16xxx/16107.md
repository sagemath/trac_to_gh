Fot the last point : I did a benchmark between it and the current implementation and [ticket:6800 #6800] was really slow (and have some bugs).

For now, I have to do a benchmark between [ticket:15673 #15673] and another implementation, so I willl look for look for other points

After some tests, `sage.misc.lazy_list` seems to be faster than `sage.structure.sequence` and `sage.combinat.species.*stream` because it it cythonized.

We will try to do an implementation of `sage.combinat.species.series_stream` over `sage.misc.lazy_list`

And even then, it is not a lazy list, but just behaves like one.\n\nWhat do you think?",

<div id="comment:16" align="right">comment:16</div>

I am thinking about implementing InfiniteSequences and have the following design issue with the two possibilites (it is not restricted to the infinite sequences, but is similar for other classes like words, stream in the species, etc., as well):

1. make `lazy_list_generic` a base class of `InfiniteSequence`

2. make an attribute `values` (or similar) in the class `InfiniteSequence` which will be an instance of `lazy_list_generic`

Both have advantages and disadvantages:

- `Sequence` uses list as a base class, thus `InfiniteSequence` should use `lazy_list`
- With 1. you can only use `lazy_list_generic`, but no derived class like `lazy_list_iterator` directly; you have to create a `lazy_list_generic` which tracks the other (as its `master` attribute; is already implemented since used with slices)
- With 2. you need to write methods for all the things you like from the lazy lists (like building slices etc.). And even then, it is not a lazy list, but just behaves like one.

What do you think?

Sequences have a common universe for all the elements of the lazy list and they are (in contrast to lazy list) a `SageObject` and not only Python's `object`.

(I assume you mean stream of coefficients?)

I want both a common universe and an algebraic structure: all coefficients are from a ring - in particular, I absolutely need a (recognisable!) zero.

Well, I really want to keep them relatively general, mainly because I won't gain anything by requiring certain operation.  I do think that it makes sense to require that the coefficients are from a (possibly noncommutative) ring.  I can't think of any applications where we do not have this.  I need the recognisable zero to be able to do the trick with recursive definition.

> So your streams seem to be a more specialized than my sequences. In this way, would it be an option for you that streams have sequences as a base class?

Yes, certainly.

Yes.
