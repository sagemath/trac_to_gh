<a id='comment:16'></a>I am thinking about implementing InfiniteSequences and have the following design issue with the two possibilites (it is not restricted to the infinite sequences, but is similar for other classes like words, stream in the species, etc., as well):

1. make `lazy_list_generic` a base class of `InfiniteSequence`

2. make an attribute `values` (or similar) in the class `InfiniteSequence` which will be an instance of `lazy_list_generic`

Both have advantages and disadvantages:

- `Sequence` uses list as a base class, thus `InfiniteSequence` should use `lazy_list`
- With 1. you can only use `lazy_list_generic`, but no derived class like `lazy_list_iterator` directly; you have to create a `lazy_list_generic` which tracks the other (as its `master` attribute; is already implemented since used with slices)
- With 2. you need to write methods for all the things you like from the lazy lists (like building slices etc.). And even then, it is not a lazy list, but just behaves like one.

What do you think?

```
class InfiniteSequence(SageObject, lazy_list_generic)
```
But when using the factory `lazy_list`, I may get a `lazy_list_iterator` or similar, so AFAIK I cannot use it in `InfiniteSequence` directly. I need to do either
- create `class InfiniteSequenceIterator(InfiniteSequence, lazy_list_iterator)` (and have to do this for all possible `lazy_list_*` or
- create a `lazy_list_generic` (`InfiniteSequence`), which uses the data of the `lazy_list_iterator`, i.e., tracks `lazy_list_iterator`. Thus having always two `lazy_list_*` instances instantiated.

Sequences have a common universe for all the elements of the lazy list and they are (in contrast to lazy list) a `SageObject` and not only Python's `object`.

OK, so in particular this answers my question: a stream of coefficients should not inherit from `lazy_list_generic` :-)  (and thanks for pointing out that `lazy_list` is not a class!)

So your question back to you: What characterizes a stream on your sense?
And why not using `lazy_list_generic` as base? (To point this out: It works; has advantages and disadvantages).

(I assume you mean stream of coefficients?)

I want both a common universe and an algebraic structure: all coefficients are from a ring - in particular, I absolutely need a (recognisable!) zero.

What operations are allowed on streams then? (I assume point-wise addition; what do you need multiplication for?)

So your streams seem to be a more specialized than my sequences. In this way, would it be an option for you that streams have sequences as a base class?
Is a stream of you a Sage `Element`? (I would guess so).

Well, I really want to keep them relatively general, mainly because I won't gain anything by requiring certain operation.  I do think that it makes sense to require that the coefficients are from a (possibly noncommutative) ring.  I can't think of any applications where we do not have this.  I need the recognisable zero to be able to do the trick with recursive definition.

> So your streams seem to be a more specialized than my sequences. In this way, would it be an option for you that streams have sequences as a base class?


Yes, certainly.

> Is a stream of you a Sage `Element`? (I would guess so).


Yes.
