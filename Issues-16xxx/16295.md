As the ticket claims this ticket implements a Cython version of `is_orthogonal_array`, which is then called by is_transversal_design and `are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares`.

Also sets a `check=False` in the code which slowed things down. As a resultthe tests are checked faster in the designs/ folder !

Nathann,

The code looks good and I have tested on an example different from your doc test.

The following run fine:

make, 
doc-test, 
docbuild html, 
code coverage is 100%

I had trouble making the pdf documentation and then went back to devel branch to check it worked Ok there.  It did and then when I moved back to u/ncohen/16295 it worked.  I am not sure what happened

I think this needs two things:

- it needs to be as consistent as possible with the purely python version inside orthogonal_arrays.py. That is, it will react the same way on the same input.  This change should be done and then a doc-test written to verify it.

- it needs to have a doctest that demonstrates the speed improvement that cycthon gives over the purely python version inside orthogonal_arrays.py.

Yeah, we had the same problems just one hour ago when Volker tried to merge #16277 or #16235... And it does not happen again because Sphinx is totall unreliable. I expect it to ocome from the dependencies, not from this ticket

Once this patch is applied there is no python version inside of `orthogonal_arrays.py`, as this patch removes it. We can add any doctest you want, but what could it be ? Remember that  this function is already tested a LOT by all constructions of OA/TD/MOLS as it is run on those instances every time one is built.

Once more, this function removes the purely python one.

Hi Nathann,

You should avoid using `any` in Cython. This is not properly cythonized. The following is better by 15%:

```
for i in range(len(OA)):
    if len(OA[i]) != k:
        if verbose:
            print {"OA"   : "Some row does not have length "+str(k),
                   "MOLS" : "The number of matrices is not "+str(k)}[terminology]
```
If you do so, you need to move up the `cdef int i,j,l`.

Sorry, I had changed branches and then opened orthogonal_array.py in an editor and so thought is_orthogonal_array was still there.

Here is my timing data

with Cython:

```
sage: time is_orthogonal_array(OA,8,9)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 27.2 µs
False
sage: time is_orthogonal_array(OA,12,11)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 239 µs
True
```


with Python:

```
sage: time is_orthogonal_array(OA,8,9,2)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 29.1 µs
False
sage: time is_orthogonal_array(OA,12,11,2)
CPU times: user 12 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 16 ms
Wall time: 13.1 ms
True
```

this shows a significant improvement in speed.

However I think this needs to be fixed:

```
sage: is_orthogonal_array(OA,12,11,3)
True
```
If it is passed t=3 it should at least alert the user that it is going to override this with t=2

Here is what I think should be done:

- fix t>2 bug
- remove "any" as Vincent suggested
- implement a doc test for
    - all your bad input/format tests
    - memory test
    - t>2 test

Hello !

> - fix t>2 bug

Done.

> - remove "any" as Vincent suggested

Guys, it is very important that you understand that this is what is called "taste", and that it makes absolutely no difference in the runtimes. If you want to make changes like that, it would be cool to implement it yourself instead of asking me to do it for you.

I just did it, because I need the patch to get in quick.

> - implement a doc test for
>     - all your bad input/format tests

Done.

> - memory test

I cannot test that.

> - t>2 test

Done.

Vincent,

What does it mean that "any" is not properly cythonized.  Does this just mean it is not efficient or does it mean there could be problems with future versions of cython?

As suggestedin the developers guide, I just ran 


```
$git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1992 commits.
$ git reset --hard trac/master
fatal: ambiguous argument 'trac/master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
```

I am not sure what to do, the developers guide does not help here.

Why do you need this? This brings you to the stable Sage release (6.2).
Of course you are miles ahead of it, being around 6.3.beta1 or even later.

as you see `switching to the branch master` rather than `already on branch master`, and you're ahead of `master` by a zillion commits, you are most probably on 
`develop`, or on some other branch you got onto while reviewing a ticket.

are you updating from `develop`? Or `master`? 
On the other hand I just tried `git trac pull 12345` (I am using [git-trac-command](https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command), which I would recommend!) it is worked.

Perhaps you should try checking out `develop` and then trying again...

Guys guys, all this is happening because I rewrote history here. The only thing to do brett is to checkout my branch, or to checkout "develop" and then to pull my branch.

The copy of my branch that you have on your computer has been abandonned. If you do a checkout on it THEN pull my branch then you are trying to apply the same modifications twice, and it fails.

If you can delete the copy of my branch that you have on my computer, do it.

It is a bit hard to debug without having both hands on your keyboard, though `:-/`

> Ahem, you care for speed? ;-)

Yeah. And it turns out that I am totally incompetent.

When caching the multiplication

```
sage: OA=designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**7,check=False)
sage: %timeit is_orthogonal_array(OA,2**7+1,2**7,2)                    
1 loops, best of 3: 618 ms per loop
```

When you don't

```
sage: OA=designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**7,check=False)
sage: %timeit is_orthogonal_array(OA,2**7+1,2**7,2)                    
1 loops, best of 3: 375 ms per loop
```

> (And there's no `times_n2[]` either.)

`times_n2` ? What for ?

Anyway, this caching was the only thing keeping me from implementing this for all t, so now I will be able to implement it generally now. Cool `-_-`

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:32):
> `times_n2` ? What for ?

It's used twice, in the outer loop and the first inner loop:

```python
    for i in range(k): # For any column C1
        C1 = OAc+i*n2
        for j in range(i+1,k): # For any column C2 > C1
            C2 = OAc+j*n2
            ...
```

One would usually not look up multiples of `n^2` (or `n` in the earlier case), but do

```python
    C1 = OAc
    i = 0
    while i < k:

        ... # similar for C2, j

        C1 += n2
        i++
```

In C, you'd presumably drop `j` (and perhaps also `i`) altogether, and just compare the pointers to the address of the (current sub-)array end.

(And inlining the bitset operations would of course make it even faster.  Afterwards special-case for `n`=2<sup>m</sup> ... :-) )

Hello !

Okayyyyyyyyy.... !

>    My plan is to produce a patch on top of this that implements Vincent's code for "any" 

This is already done, I updated the code last time and there is no "any" anymore.

> and does some small work on English

Okay.

Okay guys... Well it has been two weeks, so if the only problem of this patch is a typo perhaps it can be dealt with ?... There are several branches depending on this one...

This block of code is not about each matrix being a latin square. Actually, this is not checked anywhere so I will add a commit.

This block of code is about the orthogonality of two matrices, i.e. do you find all possible pairs of integers when you read them simultaneously cell by cell.

I understand what the code is doing.  When I say "square" I mean "latin square"  and in the language of MOLS column 0 of an OA is the row index of the Squares, column 1 is the column index and column i is latin square i-2.

Still, it must be checked that each matrix is a latin square, because right now we have this :

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares
sage: m1 = matrix([[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[2,2,2]])                                               
sage: m2 = matrix([[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[0,1,2]])                                               
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([m1,m2], verbose=True)                         
True
```

I added a commit on u/ncohen/16295_v2 to fix that. Do not worry about possible conflicts with what you are doing : when you will be done, push your commit wherever you want on a branch of yours, give me its name and I will deal with the merge.

Hello,

> I understand what the code is doing.  When I say "square" I mean "latin square"  and in the language of MOLS column 0 of an OA is the row index of the Squares, column 1 is the column index and column i is latin square i-2.

Right now when `are_mutually_latin_squares` calls `is_orthogonal_array` it does not check that the resulting OA is a `OA(k+2,n)` but only that it is a `OA(k,n)`. This, because the OA that is produced has only k columns and not k+2. This, because the columns corresponding to the row indices and the columns indices are not added to the OA.

This way, when the sequence of matrices is not a MOLS, the error message is that "matrix i is not orthogonal with matrix j" or that "matrix i is not a latin squares".

Which is, I believe, clearer to the user and easier to implement than by messing with the error messages of `is_orthogonal_design`.

Hello !

You seem to want to use "git trac" but it is not installed. This being said if you downloaded the branch without using "git trac" I don't think that just pushing is going to work.

What is the output of 

```
git push trac HEAD:public/16295
```

It should push your current branch to public/16295.

Okay. So you noticed that the "right way" did not work. Can you try the "wrong way", i.e. the line I gave you above ? From the error message you got I think it will work.

The reason is simple : you cannot simply "push" to my branch because you have no write access to it. All branches whose name is u/my_login/whatever can only be written by guys whose login is my_login.

public/whatever branches can be written by anybody, though.

> Why do you think this is not optimal? This is a normal way to go. Surely if there already was public/16295 branch you'd rather pushed there. But there was none. You can't push into someone else's branch. only into public/ ones.

I thought that that if there was a way for me to write to the patch's branch then having to create another is inoptimal, but if this is how it works then that is no problem.

`git trac` means `invoke git-trac git extension`. (see http://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command)

`git push trac` means `do git's push to the remote named `trac`.

(you can use `git remote -v` to see which remotes are set up for you)

Brett,

Here is the behaviour of your branch

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares
sage: m1 = matrix([[0,1,0],[2,0,1],[1,2,0]]) # not a latin square
sage: m2 = matrix([[0,1,2],[1,2,0],[2,0,1]]) # not a latin square                                     
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([m1,m2], verbose=True)                         
The row and column indices are not orthogonal
False
sage: m1 = matrix([[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[2,2,2]])  # not a latin square
sage: m2 = matrix([[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[0,1,2]])  # not a latin square
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([m1,m2],verbose=True)
True
sage: a,b,c,d = designs.mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares(11,4)      
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([a,b,c,d,d],verbose=True)
Squares 1 and 2 are not orthogonal
False
```

The index issues come from problem I mentionned in comment 51.

> I think if MOLS people are going to be using this code then we should add the additional 2 columns in when a MOLS gets transformed to a OA.  In that case all the error messages I have changed are correct and this is what MOLS people will expect

Here is what my branch u/ncohen/16295_v2 (mentionned in comment 50) does :

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares
sage: m1 = matrix([[0,1,0],[2,0,1],[1,2,0]]) # not a latin square
sage: m2 = matrix([[0,1,2],[1,2,0],[2,0,1]]) # not a latin square
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([m1,m2], verbose=True) 
Matrix 0 is not row latin
False
sage: m1 = matrix([[0,0,0],[1,1,1],[2,2,2]])  # not a latin square
sage: m2 = matrix([[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[0,1,2]])  # not a latin square
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([m1,m2],verbose=True)
Matrix 0 is not row latin
False
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares
sage: a,b,c,d = designs.mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares(11,4)
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([a,b,c,d,d],verbose=True)
Matrices 3 and 4 are not orthogonal
False
```

Our terminology is almost the same (we can replace "matrix" with "square" if you prefer). The interest of mine is that you do not have to add MOLS-specific code to the `is_orthogonal_array` function. Thus do you mind if we keep my version of the code to make `are_mutually_orthogonal_squares` correct and include your typo fix ?

Nathann,

I strongly feel that it would be much more consistent with

1) what people in design theory will expect the code to do

2) the equivalence between OAs and MOLS

to have `are_mutually_orthogonal_squares` add the two extra columns and then simply call `is_orthogonal_array`.  This will have the effect of checking that all the squares are, in fact latin and you will not have to have `are_mutually_orthogonal_squares` do this extra checking.

in my opinion as a design theorist, the behaviour you cite in comment 62 of my code is all correct.  In the second example the squares ARE orthogonal, they are just NOT latin.  if you add the additional two columns the behaviour will be reported.

Hello !

You claim again that my code does something that somebody (a user ?) "in design theory" might not expect. Can you tell me what it is ? Or is the function okay for the user's point of view, while you think that the way it is coded is "something that people in design theory" would not expect ?

I would have agreed if the function only returned `True/False` answer. What you are telling me to do is that I should consider all latins squares as k rows of a TD to which I add the two row/column ones, only to differentiate them later in a function that has no reason to contain MOLS-specific code.

This is why it does not make sense to me to build a homogeneous input only to dissassemble it immediately afterwards.

Besides, I expect that my commented code is sufficient for anybody "who does design theory" to understand what exactly happens.

> in my opinion as a design theorist, the behaviour you cite in comment 62 of my code is all correct.  

It is not. The function is named "are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares". It should return True if the input consists of mutually orthogonal latin squares.

> In the second example the squares ARE orthogonal, they are just NOT latin.  if you add the additional two columns the behaviour will be reported.

I agree with that, I am just showing that your branch returns wrong results. If this is fixed the results will be correct. This being said, if this is fixed then what you said just above, i.e. that the function should return True even when the input does not consist of latin squares, will not hold anymore. And so according to you the function will return wrong results.

<div id="comment:65" align="right">comment:65</div>

Two details that may help you decide :

1) The current behaviour of the are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares is to check that the latin squares are latin squares, and so changing that would mean changing the behaviour of the function

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.latin_squares import are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares
sage: are_mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares([Matrix([[1,1],[1,0]])])                       
False
```

2) All results returned by the constructors of `mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares` are checked using this function.. If it does not check whether the latin squares are orthogonal then we need to make sure that the output of our constructors are actually latin squares

Hi Nathann,

We waited too long for that ticket and many tickets are depending on this one. For me the review is basically done as the function does what is specified.

I added one nice doctest at `u/vdelecroix/16295`... If you like it, set my branch to positive review otherwise set yours to positive review.

Vincent
