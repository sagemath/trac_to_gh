In Sage 6.2

```
sage: GF(11^23, 'a').gen()^Zmod(11)(1)

In 5.9 this used to give

a

I agree that mathematically the operation does not make sense, unless the modulus is equal to the order of the element (but computing it would be overkill in my opinion) or a multiple (the only reasonable one being cardinality - 1).

Now, if we want to raise a `ValueError`, this is not a Pari issue anymore: it is a huge issue in basically any component of Sage!

```
sage: 3^Zmod(3)(2)
9
sage: GF(101)(2)^Zmod(3)(2)
4
sage: QQ['x'].gen()^Zmod(3)(2)
x^2
sage: i^Zmod(3)(2)
-1
sage: AbelianGroup([10])[1]^Zmod(3)(2)
f^2
```

etc...

Here is a branch to make `FiniteFieldElement_pari_ffelt.__pow__()` always convert the exponent to an integer.  This fixes the following mathematically wrong answer to return `a`:

```
sage: q = 11^23
sage: F.<a> = FiniteField(q)
sage: a^Mod(1, q - 1)
1
```
The new code actually seems to be marginally faster than the old one (about 10% on this example).  It also adds a warning to the documentation that we do not check for well-definedness before converting the exponent to an integer.
