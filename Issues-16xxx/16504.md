```
This should create an unbounded real variable:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=False) 
```

We should see `nonnegative` as a toggle, not as a type. The following should also work as expected intuitively:

```
sage: x = p.new_variable(integer=True, nonnegative=False)
sage: x = p.new_variable(integer=True, nonnegative=True)
```

That was the point of #15521.

Also, it may seem weird to see all these variables be nonnegative by default but that's really the standard for LP solvers. The LP backends really assume non negativity unless asked otherwise, and changing the standard in Sage is really something that we do "for the general mathematicians knowing that it could surprise guys used to LP".

I don't think that #15521 made things more clear...

How about this:
we require at most one of `integer`, `binary`, `real` to be given, with `real` the default if none is given.

`nonnegative` is a boolean determining whether or not the variable is assumed to be nonnegative. In the function, we have `nonnegative=None` by default which is currently interpreted as `nonnegative=True` but with the warning from #15521.

I think this proposal is backwards- and forwards-compatible (unlike #15521, which is backwards- but not forwards-compatible).

```python

        raise ValueError("exactly one of the available types has to be True")

Hello !

Here is the branch. Took much longer than I thought.

What it does :
- Removes the `is_nonnegative`, `set_nonnegative` functions that were introduced in #15521 as 'nonnegative' is not meant to be a variable type but a  'property' of any type. Those functions are renamed to `is_real` and `set_real`, i.e. their status before #16504

- It was formerly possible to do things like that 

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: v = p.new_variable()
sage: p.set_min(v[0],15)
sage: p.get_min(v[0])
15.0
```
  but it was NOT possible to do things like that

```
sage: p.set_min(v,17)
sage: p.get_min(v[18])
17.0
```
i.e. it was possible to define upper/lower bound on a specific variable, but not to do the same on a dictionary of variables in such a way that the new variables created fro the dictionary will inherit the bounds. But that's exactly what we wanted to do here.

  Thus I needed to add arguments lower/upper bound to the constructor of `MIPVariable`, plus set functions where it was needed.

Well... `needs_review` !

Nathann

Could you replace

```
if isinstance(v, MIPVariable):
    v.set_min(min)
else:
    self._backend.variable_lower_bound(self._variables[v], min)
```
by the more Pythonic

```
try:
    v.set_min(min)
except AttributeError:
    self._backend.variable_lower_bound(self._variables[v], min)
```

My personal opinion is that `v.set_min(min)` should actually work in all cases, but that's perhaps for a new ticket.

Because there is no need for a warning anymore : now the user explicitly says whether he wants the variables to be nonnegative or not, or he gets a warning.

It will work, and there should be no wrong answer (unless there is a bug somewhere). The default behaviour is now "nonnegative + warning", and the correct way to use this class is to specify a value for nonnegative.
