This should create an unbounded real variable:

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=False) 
```

We should see `nonnegative` as a toggle, not as a type. The following should also work as expected intuitively:

```
sage: x = p.new_variable(integer=True, nonnegative=False)
sage: x = p.new_variable(integer=True, nonnegative=True)
```

That was the point of #15521.

Also, it may seem weird to see all these variables be nonnegative by default but that's really the standard for LP solvers. The LP backends really assume non negativity unless asked otherwise, and changing the standard in Sage is really something that we do "for the general mathematicians knowing that it could surprise guys used to LP".

I don't think that #15521 made things more clear...

How about this:
we require at most one of `integer`, `binary`, `real` to be given, with `real` the default if none is given.

`nonnegative` is a boolean determining whether or not the variable is assumed to be nonnegative. In the function, we have `nonnegative=None` by default which is currently interpreted as `nonnegative=True` but with the warning from #15521.

I think this proposal is backwards- and forwards-compatible (unlike #15521, which is backwards- but not forwards-compatible).

Makes sense. Even though, with the turn that events take, I wonder if it would not be better to require one of them to be explicitly given : no default. Again, nonnegative variables are the default in this field, and we switched to another. Requiring a variable would require the users to read the doc, which may avoid misunderstandings.

Hello !

Here is the branch. Took much longer than I thought.

What it does :
- Removes the `is_nonnegative`, `set_nonnegative` functions that were introduced in #15521 as 'nonnegative' is not meant to be a variable type but a  'property' of any type. Those functions are renamed to `is_real` and `set_real`, i.e. their status before #16504

- It was formerly possible to do things like that 

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram()
sage: v = p.new_variable()
sage: p.set_min(v[0],15)
sage: p.get_min(v[0])
15.0
```
  but it was NOT possible to do things like that

```
sage: p.set_min(v,17)
sage: p.get_min(v[18])
17.0
```
i.e. it was possible to define upper/lower bound on a specific variable, but not to do the same on a dictionary of variables in such a way that the new variables created fro the dictionary will inherit the bounds. But that's exactly what we wanted to do here.

  Thus I needed to add arguments lower/upper bound to the constructor of `MIPVariable`, plus set functions where it was needed.

Well... `needs_review` !

Could you replace

```
if isinstance(v, MIPVariable):
    v.set_min(min)
else:
    self._backend.variable_lower_bound(self._variables[v], min)
```
by the more Pythonic

```
try:
    v.set_min(min)
except AttributeError:
    self._backend.variable_lower_bound(self._variables[v], min)
```

My personal opinion is that `v.set_min(min)` should actually work in all cases, but that's perhaps for a new ticket.
