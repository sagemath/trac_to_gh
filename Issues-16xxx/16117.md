<a id='comment:8'></a>Hey Anne,

I've made a couple of changes:

- removed tab characters,
- some minor grammar corrections,
- added a reference for Stanley's book and links in the tutorial,
- added link to splay trees in Tsetlin library,
- changed the format for edges in the digraph, and
- other misc formatting tweaks.

If you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.
