Complete support for modular forms for the Hecke triangle group corresponding to n=infinity
(the theta subgroup) with corresponding + further doctests/documentation.

The situation is slightly different since there are now two cusps with
two corresponding generators.

In particular the limit of the generator f_rho tends to 1 and the generator
for n=infinity is instead E4 which is the limit of f_rho^n.

Note that only functions which are meromorphic and meromorphic at the cusps are considerd.
E.g. E4 is the 8th power of theta, but smaller powers are no longer meromorphic at -1.
Also note that limits of functions/coefficients as n tends to infinity are usually given by
the corresponding function in the theta subgroup.

Additionally the ticket adds support for experimental rationalization of series,
refactoring of code which in particular provides more robust numerical Fourier expansions
and Eisenstein series of arbitrary weight for n=3,4,6.

The ticket also fixes a mistake from #16839 and has some other small changes.

This looks good. I have reviewed the changes originally introduced in #16839, too. Several corrections to the latter have been made. I.e. #16839 should be closed as invalid or similar after this.

As soon as the buildbot has run this, this can be changed to positive review.
