Right now I'm too tired to come up with a minimal example, but is this a case of misuse or should we have morphisms passed to `register_coercion` carry strong references? Other ideas?

Is this a typo? Or is it really the case that a coerce map into B is registered during *creation of A* by calling `register_coercion` *on B*? This would be a misuse.

> Next suppose that `B` becomes garbage collected, and then so does `phi`.


That's the expected/preferred behaviour, since otherwise we'd have memory leaks.

> Then `B` is recreated. Expecting there to be a coercion map from `A -> B`, the user becomes very surprised when Sage responds with an errors saying there is no coercion map.


That's why the coerce map from A to B should either be registered *during creation of B* using `register_coercion`, or (as Nils pointed out) should be registered using `register_embedding` during creation of A, which assumes that A embeds into B and may be done only once.

> Right now I'm too tired to come up with a minimal example, but is this a case of misuse


Misuse.

Or, if calling `register_coercion` during creation of B rather than A is no option, you should/could rely on `_coerce_map_from_` (on B, of course).
