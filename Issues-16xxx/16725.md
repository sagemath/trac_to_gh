As discussed on #16718, not all groups have a `monoid_generators` method but we can define them by taking the generators as a group and their inverses.

Hello Travis !

Hmmmm... `group_generators` calls `monoid_generators` and conversely. Isn't that an infinite loop, for some instance that I cannot create ? `:-P`

Also, if a group has no `group_generators` method nor `monoid_generators` method then `MyGroup.group_generators()` will result in an `AttributeError` saying that `monoid_generators` does not exist, which feels a bit weird `:-/`

Unfortunately we don't currently have a way to break out of such not-implemented generic infinite loops (there's another example with descents in Weyl groups #15456).

> Also, if a group has no `group_generators` method nor `monoid_generators` method then `MyGroup.group_generators()` will result in an `AttributeError` saying that `monoid_generators` does not exist, which feels a bit weird `:-/`

With this, that situation will never occur since we've defined a generic `group_generators` and `monoid_generators` in the `Groups` category, so every group gets it.

Helloooooooooooo !!!

> Unfortunately we don't currently have a way to break out of such not-implemented generic infinite loops (there's another example with descents in Weyl groups #15456).

But don't you enter this infinite loop as soon as a group has no `.gens()` ?

```
sage: G=groups.presentation.Cyclic(10)
sage: G=G.cartesian_product(G)
sage: G.gens()
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
sage: G.group_generators()
<loop>
```

Right right. I just don't know much about groups in Sage, and it was the only way I knew to produce the bug `:-)`

> The other option would be to not have `group_generators` call `monoid_generators`. I think the infinite loop is the lesser of two evils (at least until we have the framework for semi-abstract methods like this).

Hmmmm... And what would you think of not having `group_generators` call `monoid_generators`, and have `group_generators` raise an exception if `gens()` is not defined ? Something like that ?

`AttributeError: No generators are available for this group. Please implement a .group_generators() method`

It would tell the user what he needs to do in order to make everything work ?...

By the way I do not really understand what this `.gens()` exactly is. The code seems to assume that `.gens()` returns group generators, but in this case does the monoid code assume that `.gens()` returns monoid generators too ?

`gens()` should be the one calling `group_generators`, not the other way around `:-/`

That's okay with me (although I've made it return a `NotImplementedError`).

`gens` is suppose to return a set of generators for this type of object. However this causes some problems if the generating set becomes smaller in a subcategory: #15381

> `gens()` should be the one calling `group_generators`, not the other way around `:-/`

I agree, but this comes from old code in Sage and I don't have the time and desire to go through and make the necessary changes.

Helloooooooooo !!

Thanks for your update !

OKay ! Is there any technical reason why you prefered to not mention the name of the function ? Do you believe that this message is sufficient for group users to know what must be done ?

I see. That's a rather unfortunate design choice.

> I agree, but this comes from old code in Sage and I don't have the time and desire to go through and make the necessary changes.

Okay. It also helps me understand what you are fighting with when you write code like that.

Hey. Now that I think of it, it is another reason to raise an exception saying explicitly that `group_generators` should be implemented. Not let them get away re-defining `gens()`.

Already did in #16269 `:-P`

My problem with categories is that I totally, deeply, wholeheartedly hate them. To me, categories are on-the-fly class inheritance, written in a non-compiled and non-typed language. It's like a disaster before the very first line is written. It can *ONLY* be slow, broken, and disappointing.
