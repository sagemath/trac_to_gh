As discussed on #16718, not all groups have a `monoid_generators` method but we can define them by taking the generators as a group and their inverses.

Unfortunately we don't currently have a way to break out of such not-implemented generic infinite loops (there's another example with descents in Weyl groups #15456).

> Also, if a group has no `group_generators` method nor `monoid_generators` method then `MyGroup.group_generators()` will result in an `AttributeError` saying that `monoid_generators` does not exist, which feels a bit weird `:-/`


With this, that situation will never occur since we've defined a generic `group_generators` and `monoid_generators` in the `Groups` category, so every group gets it.

But don't you enter this infinite loop as soon as a group has no `.gens()` ?

```
sage: G=groups.presentation.Cyclic(10)
sage: G=G.cartesian_product(G)
sage: G.gens()
AttributeError: 'CartesianProduct_with_category' object has no attribute 'gens'
sage: G.group_generators()
<loop>
```

Right right. I just don't know much about groups in Sage, and it was the only way I knew to produce the bug `:-)`

`AttributeError: No generators are available for this group. Please implement a .group_generators() method`

It would tell the user what he needs to do in order to make everything work ?...

By the way I do not really understand what this `.gens()` exactly is. The code seems to assume that `.gens()` returns group generators, but in this case does the monoid code assume that `.gens()` returns monoid generators too ?

`gens()` should be the one calling `group_generators`, not the other way around `:-/`

That's okay with me (although I've made it return a `NotImplementedError`).

`gens` is suppose to return a set of generators for this type of object. However this causes some problems if the generating set becomes smaller in a subcategory: #15381

> `gens()` should be the one calling `group_generators`, not the other way around `:-/`


I agree, but this comes from old code in Sage and I don't have the time and desire to go through and make the necessary changes.

Okay. It also helps me understand what you are fighting with when you write code like that.

Since it is raised by `group_generators`, I think it is sufficient.

HMmmm... I just looked at the code again, and you are right: it is better as it is.

Already did in #16269 `:-P`

My problem with categories is that I totally, deeply, wholeheartedly hate them. To me, categories are on-the-fly class inheritance, written in a non-compiled and non-typed language. It's like a disaster before the very first line is written. It can *ONLY* be slow, broken, and disappointing.

If the language were compiled and typed, well.. It may work. But that is not the case, and in the end most of the computations are spent on the category infrastructure rather than on what the user wants.

I had the problem recently because of very slow addition in the product of additive groups: it was solved by using the group product Sage object to obtain the addition law in the group, which is then translated to a matrix, then all the work is done with the matrix itself. Thank you categories !
