For profiling purposes and even more for citation management (see #16777) it is desirable to get a full file path when profiling pyx-files. Cython generates this information in Cython/Compiler/ModuleNode.py at line 688 (as of Sage 6.3). Putting os.path.abspath there yields the desired effect.

Upstream has been provided with a pull request. See http://github.com/cython/cython/pull/315.

Cython has merged 315. I hope this will be part of Cython 0.21, and I suppose then this can be closed as soon as we have upgraded Cython.
