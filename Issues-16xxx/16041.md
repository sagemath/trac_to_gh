Volker says [this macports ticket](http://trac.macports.org/ticket/39848) has the fix, which seems reasonable.

Sorry, this means we have to add this to the flags.  I'll try something kludgy like adding

```
export NO_APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO=1
```
in my own to try this out, but presumably we would want to do a case for Darwin 8 in spkg-install.

Yes, this works.  In spkg-install, do

```
if { uname -sr | grep 'Darwin 8' ;} &>/dev/null; then
    export NO_APPLE_COMMON_CRYPTO=1
fi
```
I can't turn this into a branch yet on that machine, I don't think - at least, `sage -git diff` hangs - but I'll gladly approve this if someone does.  This shouldn't affect any other platform than Tiger, since we don't support Panther and anything after this supports this common crypto thingie.

Putting as blocker since fix is here and prevents building.
