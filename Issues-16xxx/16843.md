For future reference, it's better to just put these types of questions as comments.

Replying to mkamalakshya:
> Should Zero morphism be a morphism of rings?
> In other words, do we assume that our homomorphisms take 1 to 1?

We have to be careful about what we mean by '1' in the image. In particular, the image is the trivial ring (field) with `0 = 1` and it still satisfies all of the usual ring (field) properties (where we aren't dividing, but it's just a statement about the multiplicative inverse). So in this case, the image of 1 from `QQ` is `0` and satisfies all of the expected multiplicative identity axioms:

* `0x = x0 = x` (note that `x = 0` in the image)
* `x x^{-1} = x^{-1} x = 0` (and `x^{-1} = 0` as well in the image)

So the zero morphism is a morphism as rings (fields) by sending the additive/multiplicative identity to the additive/multiplicative identity.

PS - Once a branch is set, you can put this to needs review (*wink wink* to the cc's).

No, it isn't.  **The zero map between two rings is a ring homomorphism if and only if the codomain is the zero ring** (note: codomain, not image).

You are not correctly checking the definition of ring homomorphism.  A ring is a triple (*R*, +, .) satisfying the ring axioms, which say (among other things) that there exists a two-sided multiplicative identity 1 in *R*; this is automatically unique.  A ring homomorphism from *R* to *S* is a homomorphism of additive groups that respects the multiplication *and* sends the multiplicative identity element of *R* to that of *S*.  (One can rephrase this as saying that is compatible with the empty product.  See also [http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0135](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0135).)  This implies in particular that any ring homomorphism from **Q** to itself sends 1 to 1, and that the only ring homomorphism from **Q** to **Q** is the identity.

The zero map is only a *rng* homomorphism (since rngs don't have 1, we can't require rng homomorphisms to preserve 1).  So someone who cares about rngs might want the following to work (it currently doesn't):

```
sage: H = QQ.Hom(QQ, category=Rngs())
sage: H([0])
```
The following is also problematic (in my opinion even more so):

```
sage: H = QQ.Hom(QQ, category=VectorSpaces(QQ))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Rational Field is not in Category of vector spaces over Rational Field
```
We should make sure that `QQ` is in `VectorSpaces(QQ)`.  For the moment, one has to construct **Q** as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself:

```
sage: H = Hom(QQ^1, QQ^1)
sage: f = H([0])
sage: f
Vector space morphism represented by the matrix:
[0]
Domain: Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
Codomain: Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
```

Warning for the next bit, I'm not a commutative algebraist or category theorist, so please don't hate me if I'm spouting nonsense.

I agree that there would be problems if the 1<sub>R</sub> did not go to 1<sub>Im(f)</sub> under a funtion `f` and that we cannot show this from the ring axioms (unlike fields). I don't like that enlarging the codomain changes whether the function is a morphism or not. Can you think of another category where this happens or some property of the morphism that would change?

Agreed. I believe there was only a wish/desire for letting rings know they are also a free module/algebra over themselves; so no actual code yet. And this ticket got a lot more involved than I was originally had thought.

Hi Travis,

As far as I can see, there is no difference between fields and other rings here.
> I don't like that enlarging the codomain changes whether the function is a morphism or not.

Well, that is what you get from the definitions!  This is related to the fact that "enlarging the codomain" also changes which element is the multiplicative identity.  However, it is important to note that in this case "enlarging the codomain" is misleading terminology in the ring-theoretic context, as opposed to the set-theoretic (or module-theoretic) context, for the following reason.

The intuiton behind your objection seems to rely on an implicit assumption that the zero ring is a subring of any other ring.  In fact this is not the case.  Namely, completely in parallel to the definition of ring homomorphisms, a subring of a ring *R* is an additive subgroup closed under multiplication *and containing the multiplicative identity element of R*.  Equivalently, subrings are precisely the images of ring homomorphisms.  This implies that the zero ring is not a subring of any ring except itself.  (On the other hand, the zero ring admits a trivial homomorphism *from* any ring.)

I was just saying for fields, this is not something you need to assume, it can be shown from the axioms.
