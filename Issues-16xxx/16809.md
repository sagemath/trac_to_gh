The following line slowly expands memory usage:

```
sage: while True: _=sin(x).simplify()
```
The problem is that this uses the string interface to maxima, which creates symbols of the form `$SAGE34` with increasing numeric part. This is a memory leak in Common Lisp, because these symbols get interned.

FWIW, I've just checked it on the notebook https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr_Newman.ipynb, which is quite CPU demanding. Everything is fine! Thanks.
