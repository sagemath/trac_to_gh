```
The tool 2to3 renames `__nonzero__` to `__bool__`.
But the code has to depend on the Python version!

Note that this does *not* affect Cython extension types because Cython supports `__nonzero__` and `__bool__` independently of the Python version.

There are 25 affected modules.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Here is a brute-force tentative

* search and replace `__nonzero__` by `__bool__`
* remove the former lines that have become `__bool__ = __bool__`

Let us see what happens..

Hello Travis,

if you feel like giving it a try, please do. There is an abstract method `__nonzero__` somewhere, which is the last place where `__nonzero__` is not an alias (in python files).

I know that this reply is pointless is now, but I guess that something like that would have worked :-)

We are doing something similar for division in `CategoryObject`:

```
from __future__ import division

cdef class CategoryObject(SageObject):
    def __div__(self, other):
        return self / other
```
