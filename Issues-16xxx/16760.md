I know this is not yet needs_review, but could you move the message

```
"It is a good idea to update the Sage library now: please run 'make' from \$SAGE_ROOT."
```

to `src/bin/sage` at the end of the `install()` function? That way, it will only be shown after an explicit package install (`sage -i` or `sage -f`), but not during the normal build.

This is sub-optimal, but I don't think it's a major problem:

```
jdemeyer@tamiyo:/usr/local/src/sage-config$ ./sage -i pexpect
Found local metadata for pexpect-2.0.p6
Found local sources at /usr/local/src/sage-config/upstream/pexpect-2.0.tar.bz2
Package pexpect-2.0.p6 is already installed.
Use 'sage -f /usr/local/src/sage-config/upstream/pexpect-2.0.tar.bz2' to force a reinstallation.

It is a good idea to update the Sage library now: please run 'make' from $SAGE_ROOT.
```
