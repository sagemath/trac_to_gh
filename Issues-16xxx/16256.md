## Goal: reorganize the documentation indexes into src/sage/combinat

- For example, the thematic index
  `src/doc/en/reference/combinat/crystals.rst` is now in:
  `src/sage/combinat/crystals/__init__.py` and is accessible through
  `sage.combinat.crystals`?

  (potential variant: put it in all.py)

- What's left in `doc/en/reference/combinat` can potentially be generated automatically.
  This is not yet automatized; the content of module_list.rst still needs to be updated by hand; see the instructions on top of the file.

- All p/cython files in `src/sage/combinat/` are now included in the reference manual

- Improved thematic indexes

- New thematic indexes: algebraic_combinatorics, catalog_partitions,
  counting, enumerated_sets

- Fixed some documentation syntax glitches here and there

- Added the catalogs of permutation groups and matrix groups to the
  reference manual so that we can link to them. Fixed the doc title of
  the former.

- Added a back link from the doc of sage.dynamics

- Added (draft of) sage.combinat.quickref

This is a follow up to #16058.

End result browsable at ​http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/index.html

Warning: see the note below about the current doc compilation glitch.

## Discussion

One might argue that this reorganization of the documentation is not
consistent with what's done elsewhere in the manual. Indeed. I believe
sage.combinat is a good spot to explore better ways to organize the
documentation. Here are the advantages of this new organization:

- It's more local:

  E.g. everything the developer has to look at or modify about
  `designs`, including the index, is in src/sage/combinat/design. This
  is simpler for newcomers and means, e. g., less chances to forget to
  update the index w.r.t. the code.

- It's more consistent with the hierarchical structure of modules. In
  particular, it's agnostic of how the reference manual is split into
  documents. This was not the case before: to split
  `sage/combinat/crystals` in its own document required to move the
  thematic index about crystals from `reference/combinat/` to
  `reference/combinat/crystals`. This will ease the job of #14582.

- It's more friendly to documentation lookup using introspection

- It's more automatic; there are less chances to forget adding a file
  in the documentation which hit us often in the past.

- It enforces including all files in the documentation.

- Writing the thematic indexes as plain lists (rather than toctrees)
  is more flexible:

  - one can e.g. choose to point to the main class in a file rather
    than the full file.

  - one can focus on the user feature and not reference technical
    modules (they appear in the full module list anyway)

  - one can point to related things elsewhere in the source code

## TODO

- Proof reading

- Checking that the links are functional

- Handle the various TODO's left in the indexes (typically about
  choosing the right entry points for each module)

  Postponed to a later ticket, since those are further enhancements
  not directly related to this ticket. It's just that, while browsing
  through the indexes suggested them to me.

- Finish automatizing the building of module_list.rst.

  Postponed to #17421

- Sphinx issue: deciding on how to link to classes/functions

  in the index we would want to have the title of the documentation of
  the class rather than the name of the class; or maybe both.

  For now, we stick to the class name for now until we find a good way
  to do this with Sphinx.

- Sphinx issue: how to crossrefs documents in the thematic tutorial.

  For now we use a workaround.

- Sphinx issue: homogeneous styles for the index links

  The style used by Sphinx depends on the type of the link; this makes
  the indexes look non homogeneous. See what we can do here. This is
  purely about style rather than content, hence postponed to a later
  ticket.

- Sphinx issue: latex support in `:ref:`

  When the title of a module contains some latex, it gets displayed
  properly in tocrefs, but not in `:ref`'s. We had a look with
  Florent, and fixing this would require some fiddling with Sphinx's
  internals (the latex chunks are already stripped away in the
  crossref database!). Hence postponed for later as fixing this won't
  require changing the documentation sources.

Thanks for spotting this. I had fumbled my query replace. It should be
fixed now. Well, I am recompiling Sage right now. I'll push / update
the web page shortly.

No, really? Never thought about that :-)

Ah, yes, it somehow slipped out of the main index. Fixed. Thanks.

Of course.

Will do / done.

> You would also need to ask the release manager what he thinks of the script you have to run before generating the doc.

There is no such script to be run.

At this point, when there is a new module to be added, you can edit by
hand module_list.rst (as we used to do in index.rst). Or just be lazy,
and use the shell commands listed there. The point is that this step
can be automatized and is meant to be so.

> Perhaps there is a pure-sphinx workaround ? I guess you asked Florent about this too ?

Yes, the plan is certainly to have `module_list.rst` be built
automatically by sphinx. Something similar to the building of the
other sphinx autogenerated files (in
reference/combinat/sage/combinat/*).

> Right now I have no idea how it works. If you create another ticket, please explain that.

The only trick is in `src/doc/en/reference/combinat/index.rst` which
uses automodule to slurp in the documentation of `sage.combinat` which
itself is defined in `sage/combinat/__init__.py`

Other than that, this is just using standard ReST documentation.

Okay, whatever. If the addition above is not about a script that has to be run before generating the doc, it has nothing to do there.

What is the point of having an index like that instead of the human-made index page, i.e. the one that is being worked on on this ticket ?

systematically. Like for any other reorganization.

> Okay, whatever. If the addition above is not about a script that has to be run before generating the doc, it has nothing to do there.

This is documentation on how to update the module_list file; the top
of this file is a natural spot for it. In any cases this is meant to
be replaced by "automatically generated file; don't touch", so there
is no point discussing it.

> What is the point of having an index like that instead of the human-made index page, i.e. the one that is being worked on on this ticket ?

For the reader that's indeed essentially pointless: sphinx already
provides an index of all documented modules. However sphinx currently
needs to have somewhere a list of all the modules for which it's
supposed to build the documentation, in the form of a toctree. Other
than that, I'd be more than happy to simply get rid of it.

Pfiou, when sphinx goes into bad mode, this can be a pain to fix ... Oh well.

#16256 is now "on top" of #16058. I ended up doing it via a merge (at the end, it was no simpler than the replay I was planning to do which would have produced a cleaner history). Anyway, it's done, and the merge was the occasion to double check that everything that was in the previous index.rst is still referenced somewhere.

At this point this branch is not really ready for review, but wide open for comments.

The produced documentation has been updated.

Switching now to the review of #16058.

If I understand correctly what this ticket is about, it rather goes against your goal, as it means to add more files to the documentation. But is it mostly about improving the doc to make it easier to read/browse through.

On the bright side, this ticket intends to do so many things requiring the input of so many persons that you can safely assume it will ... take time before anything is done `:-P`

On the other hand, beware if people start creating small tickets to address independently the points mentionned above, for that's how actual work begins `:-P`

Well, I understood that some new index.rst files would be created, but I have no idea if this means that they will correspond to different entry points for sphinx and thus that they will be built separately `O_o`

This being said, if there is a way to achieve that you should probably look into Nicolas's branch to see if it is implemented already, and *in any case* create a second ticket to address it. Otherwise it will be held forever by the other things enumerated above.

Hi Jean-Pierre,

Catching up with sage-trac e-mails ... sorry I had missed this one.

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment%3A16):
> What needs to be done here?
> Building the combinat doc is one of the bottleneck on my machines, so this ticket is highly wanted.

This ticket just reorganizes the documentation so that things get
grouped nicely by sage module. But it should make it trivial to split
the documentation on top of it in #14582.

Where you could help:

- Giving your point of view on the approach taken here.

- If you have already played with splitting sphinx documents, giving
  me a hand for #14582

- And of course proofreading if you feel like it :-)

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

Indeed, as a side effect, it adds a few files that were missing from
the reference manual; but this should not make a real difference.

Be my guest and show the example by doing your share :-)

The produced documentation for the sections about graphs and designs
with this branched applied can be found respectively in:

- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/index.html
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/__init__.html

The sources are in the corresponding `__init__.py` files:

- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/sage/combinat/__init__.py
- http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/sage/combinat/designs/__init__.py

(or just clone this branch as usual)

What's to be done about those sections:

- Checking that it looks good from the user point of view
- Choosing better entry points when appropriate
  (e.g. sometime it's more natural to point directly to a class than
  to the module defining it).
- Checking that it looks natural from the dev point of view
- Checking that nothing got lost in the operation
- Proofreading for typos

Thanks in advance,
			Nicolas

Thanks ! Well, it looks cool, I mean... The design page looks exactly like it looks without your patch applied, so it's all good to me.

I am of course against having a "Graph" entry in combinat's doc. It just does not belong there, and it is not because combinat users may need other features of Sage that you should copy/paste their doc in your own document. If you can't be convinced otherwise, however, it would be better to redirect them toward the index of the graph help, i.e. this page :

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/index.html

They would get what they asked for: the part of the doc dedicated to graphs.

> - Checking that it looks good from the user point of view

The main page looks okay. The entries in the main combinat page may be sorted (Algebraic Combinatorics appears toward the end of the list) 

Given that you do not have so many entries in "Thematic indexes", you could merge it with Dynamical Systems and Miscellaneous too.

It would avoid having a Miscellaneous entry in the Miscellaneous section too.

On the other hand, as soon as you click on the entries of the main page things begin to get messy. You can reach Words by its entry on the main page, and through "Enumerated sets and combinatorial objects"

Many entries only display the name of a class rather than a full-text description, as the all files you add do not necessarily have a module doc. Sooo well. Maybe you should first add at least one doc line to the top of each file in combinat before anything else.

> - Choosing better entry points when appropriate

It's better this way. The doc is closer to the code, that's nice.

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for looking this up and your comments!

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment%3A31):
> Thanks ! Well, it looks cool, I mean... The design page looks exactly like it looks without your patch applied, so it's all good to me.

:-)

It's meant as a cross-reference, not as "include the doc here". I
clarified this by putting the link in a SEEALSO section.

The point of this cross ref is that a user interested in combinatorics
has some good chances to be interested in graph theory too.  In
general, being able to easily add such crossrefs is actually one of my
big motivation for this ticket, as the lack of such crossrefs is one
of the weakest points of the reference manual.

> it would be better to redirect them toward the index of the graph help, i.e. this page :

> http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/index.html

Good point. To achieve this, I allowed myself to add a label
"sage.graphs" at the top of `doc/en/reference/graphs/index.rst`.

> The main page looks okay. The entries in the main combinat page may be sorted (Algebraic Combinatorics appears toward the end of the list)

Good point as well. I had tried to sort them semantically, but it's
actually so close from alphabetic order that it might as well be
alphabetic.

> Given that you do not have so many entries in "Thematic indexes",

Right. I had not noticed there was now a `sage.dynamics` folder. So I
cross-ref'd it instead, and added a link back from there to
e_one_star.

Vincent: tell me if that sounds good to you. Refactoring the index for
`sage.dynamics` as is done here for `sage.combinat` will probably
allow for a nicer looking crossref back; but I leave that to a later ticket.

> It would avoid having a Miscellaneous entry in the Miscellaneous section too.

It's pretty ridiculous indeed. Not sure how to do this since that's
the title of the module, and given the content, I did not find a much
more compelling title.. Well, I renamed the section into "Utilities"
:-)

> On the other hand, as soon as you click on the entries of the main
> page things begin to get messy. You can reach Words by its entry on
> the main page, and through "Enumerated sets and combinatorial
> objects"

Yes, and this is on purpose: the organization of code according to a
tree layout is always somewhat arbitrary, whereas users looking for a
given feature may have different ideas in mind (you can come to words
by thinking "what objects can I enumerate through", or "word theory",
or "automata", or ...); so it's good that the given feature be
referenced from several places/indexes. Again I believe that's a
selling point for this ticket.

> Many entries only display the name of a class rather than a
> full-text description, as the all files you add do not necessarily
> have a module doc. Sooo well. Maybe you should first add at least
> one doc line to the top of each file in combinat before anything

Yes, there is a technical sphinx point to investigate here.

In many cases, it's better to point directly to a class (or function)
instead of a module. This can be because the rest of the module
consists of not-so-interesting utility functions; or because a module
contains several classes that deserve to be highlighted; or because
the nice introductory documentation is written in the class.

Now, the question is: when referencing a class (or function), how to
display the one-line description of that class rather than its
name. Of course, one can always duplicate by hand that description,
but that's ugly.

As a first step, I have added a `~` so that at least we only see the
name of the class and not its module prefix. That does not look great
in the output in term of consistency of style, but I believe that's ok
for now and should not delay this ticket in case configuring Sphinx
turns out to take a bit of time.

> It's better this way. The doc is closer to the code, that's nice.

Cool.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas

I wanted to give it a look but the doc does not compile with your branch. Several deprecation warnings appear at first, then there is this 

```
OSError: [dynamics ] /home/ncohen/.Sage/src/doc/en/reference/dynamics/index.rst:14: WARNING: undefined label: sage.combinat.e_one_star (if the link has no caption the label must precede a section header)
```

I don't have anything against your fetishism for cross-references in general, though in this case you cannot exactly say that the doc for graphs is hard to find in Sage. It has its own entry in the first page of the reference manual `:-P`

This being said, you will find in the "graph" page a link toward the "IncidenceStructures" defined in `combinat/designs`, just in case a guy who needs a hypergraph class ends up there. But this is way harder to find than Graphs.

Well... I solved this the other way, by adding interesting doc in the module itself. While it's not very natural to look at the doc of a module when you use Sage, these pages are the html page that appear on google when you look for help. Sooooooo I guess that quite a lot of person end up reading them.

When the module consists of many "not very useful" functions and a few interesting things, you can chose to only mention the important function in the module's head, or to emphasize those that are actually useful.

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/latin_squares.html
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.html

A couple of words, an index of functions, and you can point to the module directly.

See you later if you come to the lab !

Oh. It seems that if you "try harder" the doc can be built:

```
make doc-clean && make # will not work
```

But

```
make doc-clean; make;make;make;make;make # should eventually work
```

When you build a module which refers to a module that has not been built the reference fails, but if you type "make" again the failed document will not be rebuilt, so the problem is skipped. With a bit of luck you will build the other document someday, and THEN you will be able to build the first.

Hi Anne!

Thanks for looking!

Replying to [@anneschilling](#comment%3A35):
> I think it would be a good idea to include crystals, root systems, symmetric functions etc in the thematic indexes.

Ok, will do then!

> Also, what is the problems linking the thematic tutorials? The user should be able to access them from the front page.

Just a sphinx issue for how to generate properly the link (the reference manual is built before the thematic tutorials, so can't access its intersphinx database of labels). I'll investigate this with Florent, but we can always workaround this for now with a hardcoded html link.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas

Hi!

Here are some brief comments:

* In http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/quickref.html#sage-combinat-quickref the syntax does not seem right for some of the entries. Perhaps this part is still unfinished. I would suggest to also add Tableaux (with usual and some affine versions), Cores (perhaps close to Partitions) and Permutations (perhaps close to WeylGroups and RootSystems).

* The title "Bases for ." in "Symmetric Functions in Non-Commuting Variables" looks weird.

* I am not sure why all these catalogs are 

```

    Catalog Of Crystals
    Catalog Of Elementary Crystals
    Catalog Of Crystal Models For
    Catalog Of Crystal Models For Kirillov-Reshetikhin Crystals
```
are listed separately. The third title seems to be missing something. In principle the last three are subsumed under the link "Catalog Of Crystals".

* The link under "Introductory material" for crystals "Crystals – This overview" is broken.

* In general, math displays seem to be missing from titles which make them look strange and incomplete.

* The alphabetical module list does not seem to be alphabetical.

Best,

Anne

Good point: I have added examples with permutations, tableaux,
dyckwords, trees. I left out affine tableaux and cores for now, as
they seem sound to me a bit exotic for a general combinatorics
quickref. They definitely would make sense in a more specialized
quickref though.

What do you think?

Good point. I removed them.

By the way: what about removing the definition of crystals from
sage.combinat.crystals.catalog? It duplicates that of
sage.combinat.crystals.crystals, and the user interested just in the
catalog needs to scroll down.

Indeed: sphinx does not handle math in (references to) titles. Since
this was already broken beforehand, I was thinking of not fixing this
in this ticket to avoid being too invasive. Now, if you give me a
green light for crystals, I can fix those. Idem for the above change
to the catalog.

Fixed. More precisely work around (the usual issue with linking to the
thematic tutorials).

It's alphabetical in term of module names, but not module titles. Not
sure what's the best approach here; possibly including the name of the
module.

That is surprising given some of the syntax

```
sage: CoxeterGroup(["B",3]).some_flashy_feature()
```
or

```
sage: M = MultivariatePolynomials('x0,x1,x2,x3')
sage: M(...).action??? S.

Perhaps I am looking at an old version of the compiled documentation, but on
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/__init__.html#sage-combinat-crystals
they are still there.

Unlike stated on the catalogue site, the documentation does not completely duplicate the documentation in sage.combinat.crystals.crystals. I suggest moving it to sage.combinat.crystals.crystals.

This link
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/__init__.html#sage-combinat-crystals
on the crystal quickref site seems to be broken.

The link to sage.combinat.posets on
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/nthiery/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/quickref.html
seems to be broken.

Sure.

For me that link is still broken. I am confused (since you say it is supposed to be the link to the thematic tutorial): That link appear two lines below that under
"The Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics thematic tutorial"
Why have two links to the thematic tutorial?

That is very confusing to the user and developer since it says explicitly "alphabetical". From just looking at the list, it is not clear that the modules are listed alphabetical. Please include the name of the module or not flatten the list.

Best,

Anne

Sorry, I screwed up the rsync. Ok, now it's scripted, so that I don't
screw up again next time.

The first points to the introduction in
sage.combinat.crystals.crystals, the second one to the thematic
tutorial.

Hmm, more sphinx to do ...

Good question. It's at the end, and it gives at a glance an overview of how things are organized. Also, I would not know where to split (e.g. where to put the semi generic stuff like `type_affine`, `type_dual`). So at this point I vote for keeping things as they are. And if the file grows further, or many more types are added (e.g. for complex reflection groups), then we will split that off.

Thanks for the pointer and for that catalog! I reviewed it, and will merge it in as a dependency as soon as it's finalized.

That's how `ls` sorts stuff, I don't think that's a terrible choice.

Oh, I see, what is in the doc is not in alphabetical order indeed...
Only what is in the file used to generate the doc.

Is there any easy way to do this for the combinat folder only?

So this will be more involved, I guess doing it properly would involved asking shpinx what it intends to use for each file and sort afterward.

I found it confusing that it says on the top that the list is in alphabetical order, but then it is not. Since a user won't know what kind of sort is used, it is hard to guess (unless it is explained how the sort is done).

For example the link to the "Lie Tutorial" on

Yes, I actually first checked the source file whence my misunderstanding.
I propose to add more info on why this does not look alphabetical first and use sphinx to get a better ordering in a follow up ticket if you think it is ok.

Thanks! There is indeed a problem in that link, a spurious `reference` toward the end of the url.
I'll fix it here.

Or we could just remove the header claiming that this is an alphabetical ordering!
I just think that that part is confusing for a user.

Very good idea!

I'll do that, add an explanation of the current sort, and a todo to make it better and add sublevels as well.

Ok, my computer only just finished compiling ... here are some more comments:

* The link to /sage/src/doc/output/html/thematic_tutorials/algebraic_combinatorics.html in sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/algebraic_combinatorics.html does not seem to work for me. Actually none of the thematic tutorial links seem to work for me.

* Some of the links on the page sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/ncsf_qsym/__init__.html do not have titles.

* On the page sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/ncsym/__init__.html it says "Basis for <blank>"

So much for now!

Ok, I checked the html output on my machine and what Nicolas posted on the web was just not up to date and no fix was needed.

This involves latex.
What is strange is that it is ok in module_list.html.

There are some others all over the place.
And some font discrepancies between the titles in some lists.
I would be inclined to fix all of these later as I would not they they were introduced here.

Got it: Nicolas replaced `:ref:` with reference to the module by `:class:` with reference to the main class which is a good thing.
Adding a tilde in front of the class ref would make things a little more readable already.

I am confused what you are saying. I pulled the branch to my computer and ran make. Then I look at the compiled documentary. On the page

`sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/crystals/__init__.html`

on my computer, the link to `The Lie Methods and Related Combinatorics thematic tutorial` for example seems broken.

Also, on the front page `sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/index.html` the title "Alphabetical Module List" should probably just be changed to "Module List".

I like the Search page :-)

Ok, i'm also confused now.
And I indeed rebroke something I actually fixed.
The next commit I'll push should be ok.

Oh indeed, I just changed the title in module_list.rst itself.

I'm really not used to the doc structure yet.

Hi!

Thanks so much Jean-Pierre and Anne for your work on finalizing this, and sorry for reacting so late. I have checked all your changes, and am ok with them. I have created #17241, and linked to it from the doc, made "Module List" into "Comprehensive Module List", and rephrased a bit the description.

The version on the web was indeed outdated. I reupdated it.

Thanks Anne for spoting the broken thematic tutorial link in crystals.py. I spotted a couple others and fixed them.

For the various stylistic issues that were discussed those last days: if I am not mistaken, they are all referenced in the ticket description, and I agree that they would be best postponned to later tickets. They are indeed more about style than content, and involve more Sphinx programming/configuration rather than editing of the documentation sources.

If we all agree on this, then I believe it just remains to run the docbuilding with !`--warn-links` and fix potential glitches. I'll do that now and report.

Cheers,

                                       Nicolas

<div id="comment:100" align="right">comment:100</div>

For the record, below is what I got when checking out to master and
back to this ticket, and running:

```
sage -docbuild reference/combinat html --warn-links 2>&1 | tee log
```

If I am not mistaken, those are all unrelated to this ticket (please
double check), other than being in files that happen to be touched by
this ticket. They thus should certainly be fixed at some point, but
elsewhere.

What do you think? Ready to go?

Cheers,
                                      Nicolas

Hi Nathann, I found the pre-implemented posets under 

`sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/posets/poset_examples.html` linked under `Catalog of posets: Posets`. Is this not good enough?

Best,

I did not know that "Posets" was equal to 'posets'.

But really I do not understand why you point toward the `Poset` function instead of the posets file, which shortcuts the module-level documentation. Users will miss the whole index of functions, won't they ?

Sorry I can't experiment with your branch, the University where I am has some stupid proxy rules and I cannot download a git branch.

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for your double checking of posets!

Yes this module is important! The first item in the list points to
it. The second item then points to the main constructors in this
module.

> Also, you did not mention Hasse Diagrams.

Yes because this is about the internal data structure of posets; it
seems thus unlikely (in fact undesirable) that the user plays with
it. Note that it appears in the comprehensive module list.

I could add it back if you believe it's important.

Yikes ...

You can find the result for this page on:

Yeah, plus I need to login 10 times each time I want to post a comment, hoping that I did not logout during the 3 seconds it takes top paste my text and click on 'submit'

Currently if a guy just wants to know what Posets can do he will click on "Posets", and no other link makes any sense. Now among the links you have "Finite Posets (module), Poset (constructor), Posets (category), Poset (catalog)".

Hello !

I added a commit at `public/16256` which does the following:

- Split the links of the current posets page into three parts: 1) the catalog 2) the main classes 3) the categories
- I transformed the `class` links into `ref` links, this way the users will reach the module's doc whose purpose is precisely to explain what is inside (with an index of functions whenever possible)
- The 'categories' links appears a bit like a footnote now, as it really isn't the right folder and those links are here to redirect lost readers.
- Change "The family of Generalized Tamari Lattices" into 'Generalized Tamari Lattices'
- Added 'Combinatorial' in front of 'designs', as it is their most common name.

I will create another patch (should be done in 30 minutes) that:
- Creates an index of poset constructors in `poset_examples` (that was the aim of pointing toward the module in the first place rather than to the 'posets' object)
- I will mention the two classes contained in `linear_extensions` in this module's doc, as I changed the two links into one in this patch.

I only looked at what this branch changed in the poset and design doc, so if there is no problem with this last commit the ticket can be set back to `positive_review` on Anne's behalf.

Nathann

Ok for me.

Note: People using posets a bit seriously need to know about the
existence of the categories to have an idea of where the available
methods come from. So the links are not just about "lost readers". I
am fine with the layout you propose though.

As far as the documentation is concerned, we should have all functions appear in the poset index, even those that are implemented somewhere else. There is no systematic way to 'guess' in which file a Poset function should be implemented, so we must keep it simple at least on the user side.

When it comes to the developper's side, it would also be nice if having categories did not mean having to move functions where they do not belong. The 'categories/' folder should only contain category code, not Poset-specific code. Not any kind of mathematical code, actually.

Or perhaps we should move the categories/poset file to combinat/posets ? That would make more sense to me.

It's not so bad, for a developer at least: the question is just
whether the implementation of the function depend on the specific data
structure or not. Well, I am going off topic again.

Sure.

Well, so far the convention, in Sage and in other software with
similar mechanisms, has been to keep all the general purpose
mathematical categories together. This helps keeping them consistent
with each other, keeping an overview of the hierarchy, etc. This could
be changed, but this should be done consistently.

<div id="comment:137" align="right">comment:137</div>

Hello everybody,

I am trying to add a document to the combinat/designs/ folder, and after adding a reference toward it in the `__init__` file all I can get when I recompile the doc is this:

```
OSError: [combinat ] /home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/designs/__init__.py:docstring of sage.combinat.designs.__init__:17: WARNING: undefined label: sage.combinat.designs.resolvable_bibd (if the link has no caption the label must precede a section header)
```

Is there something specific that must be done with the new system in order to add a new document ?

Thanks,

Nathann

It is an unfortunate coincidence, but in the developer manual the combinat/ folder is used as an example of how to add a new file to the index, in the way that it had to be done before this patch was merged.

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#adding-a-new-file

Could you please take the time to update it, and to provide instruction about how this branch changed things in the combinat/ folder only ?

Thank you,

Thanks for the report.

I guess it would be sufficient to just add a comment in `.../combinat/index.rst` stating that, at this point, new modules should be added to `.../module_list.rst` instead.

I won't get to do it before the next two weeks. I am happy to review it if someone finds it urgent enough to beat me to it.
