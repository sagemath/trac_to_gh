```
sage: f = Newforms(67, names='a')[0]
sage: L = f.cuspform_lseries()      
...
RuntimeError: Unable to create L-series, due to precision or other limits in PARI.
```

This is because the field `prec` is used both for the numerical precision *and* for the number of coefficients computed.

Since the L-functions class has a `num_coeffs()` method, the proper thing is to use that to know how many coefficients to compute.

Isn't that inconsistent with how the "Reported by" field is handled?
Also, the "reported by" field links to a query for tickets reported by that person, but the "authors" field doesn't.

By the way, this ticket and #11631 are sooo embarrassing that I hope they can make it into 6.4... (especially since the fixes where kind of trivial).

"reported by" is where trac stores the account that created the ticket.

Author/Reviewer are not necessarily trac accounts (could have been written by somebody without an account, for example). Also, they end up in the git commit log.

Yes, I know, but with the same reason a defect could have been reported by somebody without an account and picked up by someone different.

> Author/Reviewer are not necessarily trac accounts (could have been written by somebody without an account, for example). Also, they end up in the git commit log.

So anybody can change the !Author/Reviewer fields without a trac account?

I agree that git commit logs should have full name and email (mine do).

I understand your point, but I still think it's a bit inconsistent, and makes it difficult to search for tickets by name, because the account name is used for some fields (e.g. reported by, comments) but the real name is used for others (author, reviewer). Also, real names are not always canonical (e.g. mine has an accented i and it's not always used consistently -- can't be used in sage source code, for instance), while trac login names should be unique.

Anyway, thanks for your work.
