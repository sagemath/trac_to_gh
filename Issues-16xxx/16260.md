Hi all, the rebased patch I posted was definitely needed, on my own Cygwin64 install at least, to let some Python dependencies of the notebook build.
Note though that Python is still very broken on Cygwin64.
A bunch of its testsuite fail, but I would not assume that the patch worsened anything.
Surely some other patches from the Cygwin folk are needed but I have no time to devote to investigating that now.
A first step would be if the Cygwin distributed Python also fails part of its testsuite or not.

Can you confirm that installation of the new spkg (with #16415) works on Cygwin?

If so, please set both tickets to "positive review" (unless there are other issues I don't know of).

Virtual memory? ;-)

Ok, just noticed the branch has to be rebased on #16415 anyway (it still contains a patch to `sage-spkg` [which isn't based on #16415 nor the other way around]).

Sure, this can get in without proper Cygwin support.
Just don't drop patches.

While that's not even true (it's a general fix for [almost all?] bashs but yours), merging parts of a ticket that this one is supposed to depend on doesn't make any sense to me.

So IMHO you should either remove patches to `sage-spkg` from the branch here, or close #16415 as a duplicate of this one, and remove the dependency.  The latter would be pretty illogical IMHO.

If we'd provide URLs to them...

Ideally we would have "checksums" for all kinds of tarballs (along with the URLs) whether offered by upstream / 3rd party ("almost" mirrors) or (just) us, and/or provide a checksum for the *uncompressed* tarball.

> Its bad enough that our retarded build system can't deal with the upstream `.tgz` ending.

Yes, it's sad we still don't fully support MS-DOS.

> But at least now the checksum is still the same as on python.org (they don't offer bz2 downloads).

Which is an upstream bug we used to fix... ;-)




Ceterum censeo Sage should support (and use) `.xz` (as btw. a couple of included packages do since quite some time IIRC).

I ran doctests once without it and once with it, and `sage/modules/vector_integer_dense.pyx` passed doctests both times.

for me it only works with the #16474#comment:3 patch applied.
Note that however I have this ticket's (#16260) branch merged over #16440 rather than over the current beta (6.3.beta3).
Without the latter the docs won't build for me.
