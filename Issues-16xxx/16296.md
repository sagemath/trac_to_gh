With the "axiomatic" approach towards categories introduced in #10963, we are now using join categories far more frequently than in the past. This involves many little operations (sorting, computation of index, ...) that should be made as fast as possible.

Hence, this ticket is about using Cython and optimizing basic algorithms in sage.categories.category and friends.

I have pushed an initial branch (starting with #10963, of course), changing the assertion so that both `types.FunctionType` and `cython_function_or_method` are permitted (no idea how to test the latter more elegantly than by the name of the type...), and I changing `AbstractMethod.__repr__` so that it gives comparable output for both Python and Cython methods.

Note: I don't think we should Cython `AbstractMethod`. After all, they are just placeholders for "real" methods and are thus not time-critical.

With the branch, Sage starts.

Some functions in `c3_controlled` can not be cdef'd, because they contain "any(...)" clauses. For example:

```
        for i in range(max_i): #from 0 <= i < max_i:
            O = heads[i]
            # Does O appear in none of the tails?
            O_key = key(O)
            if any(O_key in tailsets[j] for j in range(nbheads) if j != i):
                continue
```
It might be worth-while to see if the "any(...)" clause can be improved by something that is faster and does not use a clause. To the very least, I guess giving Cython some hints on the type (`tailsets[j]` is a set!) might pay off.

Another closure occurs in the following definition:

```
cdef list tailsets = [set(key(O) for O in tail) for tail in tails]
```
Let's see how to make this a little faster without a closure:

```python
def set_test1(list tails):
    cdef list tail
    return [set(O**2 for O in tail) for tail in tails]

cpdef list set_test2(list tails):
    cdef list tail
    cdef set part_set = set()
    cdef list result = []
    for tail in tails:
        part_set = set()
        for O in tail:
            part_set.add(O**2)
        result.append(part_set)
    return result
```
yields

```
sage: L = [[randint(0,10000) for i in range(200)] for j in range(200)]
sage: set_test1(L) == set_test2(L)
True
sage: %timeit set_test1(L)
100 loops, best of 3: 8.52 ms per loop
sage: %timeit set_test2(L)
100 loops, best of 3: 6.51 ms per loop
```
This time, we do not gain so much, but it is something, and we can make the function cpdef then, reducing the calling overhead after (c)importing it into another module.

With #16309, the documentation builds, and

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: sage_getargspec(Category.join)
ArgSpec(args=['categories', 'as_list', 'ignore_axioms', 'axioms'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=(False, (), ()))
```
I am running tests now. However, even if they pass, I'd like to try and get some more speed for the `WeakValueDictionary` used in `sage.categories.category`, and `sage.categories.category_with_axiom` probably has more potential for improvements.

Interestingly, with #16309 alone, the tests of sageinspect.py pass. But adding the commits from here, one test in sageinspect.py fails:

```
        sage: C = Rings()
        sage: HC = C.hom_category()
        sage: sage_getsourcelines(HC)
        (['    class HomCategory(HomCategory):\n', ...], ...)
```
is expected, but the indentation (that is due to the nesting) is wrong.

Actually it is even more wrong than that: The relevant class is defined as a nested class in sage.categories.rings, but we get

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getdoc_unformatted
sage: _sage_getdoc_unformatted(HC)
"File: sage/categories/category.pyx (starting at line 2361)\n\n        Initializes this HomCategory\n\n        INPUT:\n         - ``category`` -- the category whose Homsets are the objects of this category.\n         - ``name`` -- An optional name for this category.\n\n        EXAMPLES:\n\n        We need to skip one test, since the hierarchy of hom categories isn't\n        consistent yet::\n\n            sage: C = sage.categories.category.HomCategory(Rings()); C\n            Category of hom sets in Category of rings\n            sage: TestSuite(C).run(skip=['_test_category_graph'])\n        "
```
That's all really strange. The code of the nested class is

```
    class HomCategory(HomCategory):
        pass
```
and indeed we have

```
sage: HC.__doc__
```
Why is _sage_getdoc_unformatted returning something nonempty, even though the class has empty `__doc__`?

Now I get what is going wrong.

Since `Rings.HomCategory` has no docstring, `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` returns the docstring of `Rings.HomCategory.__init__`. This used to by a Python method, hence had no embedded information on the source code. But with this branch, `__init__` is a Cython information and thus has embedding information, that unfortunately lets `sage_getsourcelines` look up the wrong file.

But in the first place: Why do we need to look up `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` when calling `sage_getsourcelines`? After all, `Rings.HomCategory` is a Python class in a Python file! Shouldn't it provide all relevant information?

Hi Simon!

Thanks so much for exploring how much we could potentially gain by
cythonizing some of the category infrastructure code; we need this
kind of facts to take good decisions. At this point definitely +1 on
optimizing lower level things like c3, since the interface and
algorithms are quite final.

On the other hand, I am wondering whether the current not so massive
speed improvements make a compelling case for actually cythonizing the
file category.py right now. The point is that cythonizing makes the
code much harder to debug (I agree, this is a problem of pdb: we
really would need to have a debugger supporting both python and cython
code; alas I don't see progress in this direction anytime soon).

E.g. I find the coercion code very painful to work with precisely
because of this. In fact, when I tried to fix things a couple years
ago, I first uncythonized it ...

I fear that it would similarly slow down the followup development we
want to do with categories, e.g. improving the join algorithm.

What do you think?

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

Even if it is a Python class defined in a Cython file? I thought that problems will only start if things are cdef.

Actually improving the join algorithm speed-wise is my main goal for this ticket. I am not sure if much progress can be achieved without Cython.

I'd say: I try to improve the speed as much as possible by as much Cython as needed. In a second step, we can see if some of it can also be done in Python, or if some parts can be moved to a Cython file separate from `sage.categories.category`.

That's kind of a shame, but yes, even in this case. Put this in
`test_debug_cython.pyx`:

```
import pdb
def f(x):
    for i in range(10):
        pdb.set_trace()
        x = x + 1
```
and run

```
sage: load("test_debug_cython.pyx")
Compiling ./test_debug_cython.pyx...
sage: f(3)
```

The function f does not even appear in the backtrace.

The upcoming work is not only about speed, but also functionality. Or
trying alternative algorithms, like your pet boolean polynomial ideals
approach. And even speedwise, there may be room to improve the
algorithm itself, rather than the implementation.

> I'd say: I try to improve the speed as much as possible by as much Cython as needed.

Definitely worth trying hard and see how much we can gain. And see if
it's worth making the code more complex / harder to trace.

> if some parts can be moved to a Cython file separate from `sage.categories.category`.


This could be a good approach indeed.

Cheers,

With #15801:

```
sage: from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import canonicalize_axioms
sage: L = ["Commutative", "Connected", "Commutative", "WithBasis", "Finite"]
sage: %timeit canonicalize_axioms(L)

10000 loops, best of 3: 24.7 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Category.join(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 854 µs per loop
```

With the branch from here:

```
sage: from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import canonicalize_axioms
sage: L = ["Commutative", "Connected", "Commutative", "WithBasis", "Finite"]
sage: %timeit canonicalize_axioms(L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.77 µs per loop
sage: L = [Coalgebras(QQ), Sets().Finite(), Algebras(ZZ), SimplicialComplexes()]
sage: %timeit Category._sort(L)

sage: %timeit Category._sort_uniq(L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Category.join(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 659 µs per loop
```

So, there is an improvement of >50% in `canonicalize_axioms`, 44% in `_sort_uniq` (but not in `_sort`), and 22% in `join`.

I switched `sage.categories.category` and `sage.categories.category_with_axiom` back to Python. Instead, I created a module with helper functions. Fortunately, `_sort_uniq` is a static method, and thus it is no problem to replace it with a cpdef function imported from the helper module.

The current timings:

```
sage: from sage.categories.category_with_axiom import canonicalize_axioms, all_axioms
sage: canonicalize_axioms(all_axioms, ["Commutative", "Connected", "Commutative", "WithBasis", "Finite"])
('Finite', 'Connected', 'WithBasis', 'Commutative')
sage: %timeit canonicalize_axioms(all_axioms, L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.83 µs per loop
sage: L = [Coalgebras(QQ), Sets().Finite(), Algebras(ZZ), SimplicialComplexes()]
sage: %timeit Category._sort(L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 6.25 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Category._sort_uniq(L)
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Category.join(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 816 µs per loop
```
Note: Since I want to keep `all_axioms` in `sage.categories.category_with_axiom`, I need to provide it to `canonicalize_axioms` (now defined in the helper module) as an argument.

__Evaluation__

- `canonicalize_axioms` is still fast, and so is (almost) `_sort_uniq`.
- I kept `_sort` in for now, but it isn't used, and I'd simply remove it.
- The join is now slow again, since it is Python.

__Concerning join__

Perhaps one could create another helper function for the join. It is static, hence, a cpdef function won't be a problem. However, it uses a cache. This cache should be local to `sage.categories.category.Category`, but when defining the `join` in the helper module, we'd like to have cython-speed access to it. OTOH, we could define the cache in the helper module, and then assign it as an attribute to `Category`, if we think that the cache is needed outside of the helper.

Something more about the join:

- The cache key is computed with _sort_uniq. Fine, this is cythonised already.
- There remains a new cython function to create the flattened, normalised etc. list of super categories of the to-be-created join.
- `Category.join` would be simply like this:

  ```
    def join(...):
        T = _sort_uniq(...)
        try:
            if as_list:
                return Category._join_cache[T]._super_categories
            return Category._join_cache[T]
        except KeyError:
            pass
        S = create_super_categories(T) # this will be a list!
        if as_list:
            return S # or do caching?
        J = JoinCategory(S)
        _join_cache[T] = J
        return J
  ```

I think this would be a good compromise between cythonisation and "keeping the function where it belongs". In particular, the documentation would stay in `Categories.join`. Since `_sort`, `_sort_uniq` and `_flatten_categories` are not part of the docs anyway (or am I mistaken?), I think there should be no problem to move these over to the helper module.

So the core of the join algorithm would be in
`create_super_categories`, right? Since it's non trivial, we should
strive hard to keep it easy to find to read, and to debug. But yes,
this can be an option if we believe the difference is important enough.

> Since `_sort`, `_sort_uniq` and `_flatten_categories` are not part of the docs anyway (or am I mistaken?), I think there should be no problem to move these over to the helper module.


I think I ended up adding them to the docs. But they are explicitly
private methods, and thus susceptible to be moved at any time if this
suits us.

Now, since they are static methods, maybe you could do

```
from ... import _sort_uniq

class Category:
    _sort_uniq = _sort_uniq
```
and then the code could keep using Category._sort_uniq as before, right?

Cheers,

Surprisingly, I only get few errors. But this one is annoying:

```
Failed example:
    Category.join((Sets(), Rings(), Monoids()), as_list=True)
Expected:
    [Category of rings]
Got:
    [Category of rngs, Category of semirings]
```

But this is just due to my using the cache if `as_list=True`. I must check whether the category in the cache is a `JoinCategory`. If it isn't, then the cache item is returned, if it is, then the list of super categories is returned.

Dear Nicolas,

all tests in sage.categories pass. Some of the new stuff needs to be documented and tested. But please first comment if the code distribution of Python vs. Cython works for you.

And next I'll try to find better benchmarks.

<a id='comment:55'></a>
Here is another benchmark. Idea: We have a list of tuples of categories, with varying base rings. For each tuple, we form the join category, first with cold cache, then with warm cache.

With #15801:

```
sage: L = [(Coalgebras(GF(q,'a')), Sets.Finite(), CommutativeRings(), SimplicialComplexes()) for q in prime_powers(2,50000)]
sage: %time C = [Category.join(Cats) for Cats in L]
CPU times: user 21.1 s, sys: 136 ms, total: 21.2 s
Wall time: 21.2 s
sage: %time C = [Category.join(Cats) for Cats in L]
CPU times: user 230 ms, sys: 1 ms, total: 231 ms
Wall time: 231 ms
```

With this branch:

```
sage: L = [(Coalgebras(GF(q,'a')), Sets.Finite(), CommutativeRings(), SimplicialComplexes()) for q in prime_powers(2,50000)]
sage: %time C = [Category.join(Cats) for Cats in L]
CPU times: user 18.7 s, sys: 172 ms, total: 18.9 s
Wall time: 18.9 s
sage: %time C = [Category.join(Cats) for Cats in L]
CPU times: user 150 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 150 ms
Wall time: 162 ms
```

__Discussion of the benchmark__

- I am still not sure if this is a good test. Yes, there is some category+axiom mangling involved, but other examples might provide more of it.
- We have a speedup of 11% with cold cache.
- We have a speedup of 34% with warm cache.

FWIW, all tests pass. More tests of new functions need to be added.
