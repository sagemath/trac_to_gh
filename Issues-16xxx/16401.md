Embeddings of finite fields currently do not have consistent types:

```
sage: F = GF(5)
sage: F2 = GF(5^2, conway=True, prefix='z')      
sage: F4 = GF(5^4, conway=True, prefix='z')
sage: f = F2.coerce_map_from(F); f
Conversion map:
  From: Finite Field of size 5
  To:   Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
sage: type(f)
<type 'sage.structure.coerce_maps.DefaultConvertMap_unique'>
sage: g = F4.coerce_map_from(F2); g
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z2 of size 5^2
  To:   Finite Field in z4 of size 5^4
  Defn: z2 |--> z4^3 + z4^2 + z4 + 3
sage: type(g)
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.hom_finite_field.FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic'>
```
The purpose of this ticket is to make the construction of `f` use `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_prime`.  This will give us more functionality, in particular sections of such embeddings.

Do you expect an error to be raised when the polynomial is evaluated?

This is the single-underscore `_call_()`; if I understand correctly, the double-underscore `__call__()` will have done the work to coerce `x` into the domain, or to raise an error if this is not possible.
