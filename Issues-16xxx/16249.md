The docstring says that the default parameter `ticket_or_branch=None` refers to the current branch. However, deleting the current branch is not possible. Currently, the error message is not very helpful:

```
sage: dev.abandon()
ValueError: name must be a string
```
Now it prints:

```
sage: dev.abandon()
TypeError: abandon() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)
```
