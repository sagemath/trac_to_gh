This ticket aims to improve the p-adic bit of sha_tate for elliptic curves over Q. 

* There are a few minor points to improve in the documentation (some of the conditions are not stated precisely or slightly wrong).

* We can now allow reducible primes, too. Since #6406 we ask for the p-adic rep to be surjective. However the recent results in [1] imply that the bounds are also correct for all odd primes of semi-stable reduction when the curve admits a p-isogeny. 

* There is a small bug in padic_lseries, which made this fails:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("5040bi1")
sage: E.sha().p_primary_bound(5)
```
(reported by Charlene Soh).

Sorry for the sloppy work. Now I adjusted these two and all tests pass.

I had to change William's presentation in Bordeaux. Now there are two more or less identical examples. I thought it better not to change the example though.

I hope this would solve it, though I can't test 32-bit.

This 32-bit issue is linked to eclib having problems with 32-bit. I copied # 32-bit as I did earlier in #11211, where Paul Zimmermann noticed "However there are already some tests that are known to fail on 32-bit, for example in lib/cremona/newforms.pyx: ...". At the time I did not see any other solution than to make 32-bit fail. I don't know if the state has evolved since then. 

If so that should be solved on a different ticket. This ticket here removed one example of this #32-bit behaviour and replaced it with another.

John, do you care to comment on this? ;-)

I'm fine with making it a separate ticket, but then make sure that there *is* a separate ticket for that issue and link to it.

I am wondering why Chris removed me from the CC field....in nay case I received the email when I was added, and now I have written on the ticket so you cannot get rid of me!

I think this can be fixed by changing lines 66-70 of sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx:

```
        a1 = new_bigint(int(E.a1()))
        a2 = new_bigint(int(E.a2()))
        a3 = new_bigint(int(E.a3()))
        a4 = new_bigint(int(E.a4()))
        a6 = new_bigint(int(E.a6()))
```
Here the E.a1() etc are Sage integers, and they need to be converted into eclib bigints which are exactly NTL ZZs.  This should be possible without going via Python ints.  The new_bigint function  is defined near the top of defs.pxi is a long --> ZZ conversion (just NTL's to_ZZ).  If nothing else, I think NTL can convert decimal strings to ZZs so you could try just replacing "int" with "str" in those 5 lines?
