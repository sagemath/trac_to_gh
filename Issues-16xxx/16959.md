This ticket aims to improve the p-adic bit of sha_tate for elliptic curves over Q. 

* There are a few minor points to improve in the documentation (some of the conditions are not stated precisely or slightly wrong).

* We can now allow reducible primes, too. Since #6406 we ask for the p-adic rep to be surjective. However the recent results in [1] imply that the bounds are also correct for all odd primes of semi-stable reduction when the curve admits a p-isogeny. 

* There is a small bug in padic_lseries, which made this fails:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("5040bi1")
sage: E.sha().p_primary_bound(5)
```
(reported by Charlene Soh).

This 32-bit issue is linked to eclib having problems with 32-bit. I copied # 32-bit as I did earlier in #11211, where Paul Zimmermann noticed "However there are already some tests that are known to fail on 32-bit, for example in lib/cremona/newforms.pyx: ...". At the time I did not see any other solution than to make 32-bit fail. I don't know if the state has evolved since then. 

If so that should be solved on a different ticket. This ticket here removed one example of this #32-bit behaviour and replaced it with another.

I think this can be fixed by changing lines 66-70 of sage/libs/cremona/newforms.pyx:
