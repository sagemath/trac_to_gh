(this was reported as part of #6882)

... solving of ode y'=c*x is not correct, the free variable is messed up with a parameter, see [sage-devel](http://groups.google.cz/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e04cbc547095f2ac) - thanks for Yuri Karadzhov

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
sage: symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string('%c')
c
sage: c=var('c'); y=function('y',x); eq=diff(y,x)==c*x; eq
D[0](y)(x) == c*x
sage: desolve(eq,y,ivar=x)
1/2*c*x^2 + c
```
the answer should be something like 1/2*c*x<sup>2</sup> + c1

The fix depends on closing #8734. The `c` variable that comes from Sage can then be easily recognized, and the constant `c` should then be renamed to `c1` or `_C1`.

Actually, these variables are very easy to recognize any way:

```
sage: function('f',x)
f(x)
sage: var('c')
c
sage: W=diff(f(x),x,x)-f(x)+c
sage: V=diff(f(x),x)-f(x)+c
sage: maxima_calculus(V).ode2(f(x),x)
'f(x)=(c*%e^-x+%c)*%e^x
sage: maxima_calculus(W).ode2(f(x),x)
'f(x)=%k1*%e^x+%k2*%e^-x+c
```
As you can see, maxima creates these constants as `%c, %k1, %k2`, so there's no collision there. The collision only happens upon conversion back to sage. So we make the conversion more intelligent there wouldn't be an issue at all. Using `sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.max_to_sr` this would be fairly straightforward.

looking at the source code of the programs in share/diffequations,
it seems to me that those 3 are the only ones. I don't know if you
have other programs in mind, apart from those in share/diffequations.

It's really unfortunate with the underscores.  But I hate to think of checking whether `C`, `C1`, `C2` etc. were defined and then using whatever the next one was.  Anyway, unless Nils (who knows this stuff better than me) objects to your solution (quoting [comment:9](#comment%3A9):ticket:9421)

then as I said, this is definitely much better than leaving it 'as is'.

No problem.   Do you think it's useful to add an example where there might have otherwise been a collision of names, or is that superfluous?

Also, why is the doctest

```
sefms('%k1*%x + %k2*%y + %c')
```
and not

```
sefms('%k1*x + %k2*y + %c')
```
I'm not sure what the `%` is doing on the variables, though I don't doubt Sage would strip those percents off, if I recall that part of the code correctly (it's been a while, though).

That has never been a requirement for objects to "exist" in sage. I don't think this is an issue at all. The objects can be accessed via `SR("_C")` as usual, and in fact if the user does `_C=var("_C")` or toplevel `var("_C")` he/she can have the object bound. We should absolutely not mess with namespaces during runtime. We *might* prebind `_C` etc. if someone thinks it's too difficult for users otherwise.

You can already have them predefined by putting in `$HOME/.sage/init.sage` something like:

```
_C = SR.var("_C")
_K1 = SR.var("_K1")
_K2 = SR.var("_K2")
```
Various notebook/mathcloud solutions probably expose this mechanism or something equivalent somehow.

The error people get when they do try to access these objects via the correspondingly named variables is pretty clear and they'll probably do the right thing next (they've already been able to define a differential equation in sage, so they've had to jump some hurdles already). I'd propose holding off on filling global namespace now and only consider that if it turns out to be a common complaint. The "c,k1,k2" we had before suffered the same problem and didn't generate complaints either.

I think my point is that presumably if one then retyped the answer, or tried to use it somehow, one would get an error about an undefined variable.  

```

sage: var('d')
d
sage: y=function('y',x); eq=diff(y,x)==d*x; eq
D[0](y)(x) == d*x
sage: desolve(eq,y,ivar=x)
1/2*d*x^2 + c
sage: c
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-2cd6ee2c70b0> in <module>()
----> 1 c

NameError: name 'c' is not defined
```
That said, 

```

sage: D = desolve(eq,y,ivar=x)
sage: D.subs(c=3)
1/2*d*x^2 + 3
```
works.  So I would be comfortable with very good documentation or something ahead of time - and Nils' comment indicates that better documentation for how to use these is best.

Is the line

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string as sefms
```
necessary in the doctest?  Though it doesn't hurt anything.

---

```
sage: sefms('%k1*x + %k2*y + %c')
_K1*x + _K2*y + _C
sage: _._latex_()
'_{K_{1}} x + _{K_{2}} y + _{C}'
```
I have a feeling this is not what we are looking for, but I don't know how to deal with it best.  Presumably 'naked variables/constants' don't need to be subscripted in typesetting.

One idea, which [mimics our handling of lambda](http://sagemath.org/doc/prep/Programming.html#gotchas-from-names-and-copies), would be to make the constants have names `k1_` and `c_` instead.

```
sage: var('lambda_')
lambda_
sage: latex(_)
\lambda
sage: var('beta_')
beta_
sage: latex(_)
\beta
sage: var('k1_')
k1_
sage: latex(_)
\mathit{k1}
```
Note that this is not what is desired either, since

```
sage: latex(k1)
k_{1}
sage: latex(k1_)
\mathit{k1}
sage: latex(c_)
c
```
I don't know whether this is a good solution, but we do need proper typesetting of these guys.

Turns out it currently just keeps the underscore.

This change could minutely slow down latex for variables that start with underscores, or if the symtable gets huge... but that is probably silly to worry about for now, neither are likely in the near future.  Also may help with #6882.  So I'm happy with this commit.

Doctest (presumably just in `latex_variable_name`) for the latexing.  I realize this seems like a lot of rounds, but I've found the review process very helpful in the past, anyway.   (And I'm sorry I haven't time to check out the last commit of #8734 yet.)
