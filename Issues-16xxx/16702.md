I copy/pasted the test which is already used for gap_packages. Plus you don't have any way to differentiate exceptions originating from a gap code I guess. If you try/catch you could catch too much and say that the package is not installed when something else is going wrong.

have you ever noticed that Sage is full of crappy code, in some places at least ? 
;-)

I am not saying that inside the exception processing block you should not test for installation of this package.
But without `try` your patch is too intrusive.
There are ways to extend GAP and/or Sage in place not involving installing Sage packages...

I don't see why, and I don't see what you would write instead.

I don't understand that.

e.g.

```
def group_id(self):
        try:
            return [Integer(n) for n in self._gap_().IdGroup()]
        except: 
            if not is_package_installed('database_gap'):

often it's just copying some files into `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap` that does the trick.
That is, installing GAP packages (see http://gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html) often basically amounts to this.
