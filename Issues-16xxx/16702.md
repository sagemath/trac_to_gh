have you ever noticed that Sage is full of crappy code, in some places at least ? 
;-)

I am not saying that inside the exception processing block you should not test for installation of this package.
But without `try` your patch is too intrusive.
There are ways to extend GAP and/or Sage in place not involving installing Sage packages...

I don't see why, and I don't see what you would write instead.

I don't understand that.

e.g.

```
def group_id(self):
        try:
            return [Integer(n) for n in self._gap_().IdGroup()]
        except: 
            if not is_package_installed('database_gap'):
                 raise RuntimeError("You must install the optional database_gap package first.")
            print "oops..."
            raise
```

often it's just copying some files into `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap` that does the trick.
That is, installing GAP packages (see http://gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html) often basically amounts to this.
