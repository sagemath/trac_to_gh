sage: G = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: G.order?
Type:            instancemethod
String form:     <bound method SymmetricGroup_with_category.order of Symmetric group of order 4! as a permutation group>
File:            /Applications/Sage-6.0.app/Contents/Resources/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py
Definition:      G.order(self)
Docstring:
   Return the number of elements of this group.
```

Would like to add a line:
