I've been in contact with Arne and he's very cooperative to psuh a new release on IML website.

**Upstream**: [http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml-1.0.4.tar.bz2](http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~astorjoh/iml-1.0.4.tar.bz2)

Should:
* use different cblas and in particular pass easily something different from "-lcblas -latlas" to the linker,
* and so correctly link the shared lib,
* and so let shared libs be built on Cygwin (#15389),
* anything else you want to fix.

Any comments, rants, suggestions welcome.

Particular attention could be cast upon:
* the new --with-cblas configure option/m4 macros,
* the netlib cblas.h inclusion,
* libtool versioning, I've just updated the revision part as should be, but before that it was naively set.

Sure, it's not an official release and I don't want people to think so.
It is though supposed to become the official one.
Therefore I've added a `.prerelease` to the archive so that people trying it out will have to perform a non trivial action and be aware of what they do.

Blush. OK I found the problem. While openblas install a cblas.h in the standard location it wants to load another header, not in a standard location. Not sure how I managed to configure it once without that additional header.

After further tinkering around with the cblas-check.m4 I think it is OK as it is. No need to over-engineer it.

Now one thing that tripped me is the fact that your tarball include a config.log where cblas and atlas are not found. And I kept looking at it to find what was wrong while portage was always doing an out-of-source build in a different directory (and I knew about it, why did I keep looking at the config.log in the wrong place I don't know). Could you please remove that piece of cruft that you generated on gcc1-power7.osuosl.org from the final tarball.
Also, now that I have it open in front of my eyes you may want to bump the following line to 1.0.4 near the top of configure.ac

```
AC_INIT(IML, 1.0.3)

After some thoughts if I fix things specifically for openblas it may blow in my face for some other proprietary implementations. There are two things:
* I cannot think of any other packages that looks for the cblas.h header, doesn't mean it is wrong to look for it, just unusual - most other package assume it or bring it with them.
* You could relax the need to have both variables defined at the same time and make configure spit a message asking whether both need to be set in case of failure.

Failing that, I will port the patch for iml 1.0.3 to just use pkg-config in the gentoo ebuild.

You mean there is an "#include ..." in cblas.h which points to a header not found?? so you have to sepcify a bunch of "-I" to be able to use it?

Oups, I'll remove this for sure.

Ok, I'll always fallback to the provided cblas.h if not found in standard locations.

Will do that, it will ease the use of the provided cblas.h.

Sure pkg-config would be nice, I just don't want to add that as a dependency to IML as it's not my software, I'm just helping Arne here.

cblas.h from openblas has a line

```
#include "openblas_config.h"
```
unfortunately we install it in /usr/include/openblas. There is a convoluted logic to it and since we do everything with .pc files it normally doesn't matter - we may move away from that model in the long term.

I am not suggesting you use pkg-config to find cblas because it is not, as yet, standard. But If I patch it for Gentoo I'll save myself some trouble in the rest of the building script since all cblas you install in Gentoo will have a cblas.pc file - we add one if it is not already included.

I see.
And I assume this "first" cblas.h header is also in a non standard location?
(Just to be sure it won't get picked up if you don't feed --with-cblas-inc anything, otherwise, I'll just make it so the provided IML cblas.h provided header is used all the time)

That's the state of cblas headers as far as I know
* atlas has an atlas.h header and a whole atlas subfolder - but cblas.h is nicely self contained.
* gotoblas2/openblas calls an extra header
* netlib has just cblas.h
* gsl has gsl_cblas.h which is fortunately self contained
* blis sort of has a (c)blas layer in blis/bli_blas.h that is full of blis subheader
That's all for open source as far as I know. I don't know what the proprietary look like (well I do for IBM ESSL but I'd rather not make this an ESSL flame).

I have had one success at configuring it and I am not sure how it happened. In fact I am starting to think I hallucinated that success or somehow was looking at some other code.

Got it!

```
		if test "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/include" -a "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/local/include"; then

CBLAS_CFLAGS needs to be set outside of the test for CBLAS_LIBRARY. If you only have standard paths in CBLAS_LIBRARY_PATH, CBLAS_CFLAGS is never set. I would do

```

				fi

```
instead. Nit-picky, should you do 

```
CBLAS_LIBS="-L${CBLAS_LIBRARY} ${CBLAS_LIBS}"
```
instead of 

```
CBLAS_LIBS="${CBLAS_LIBS} -L${CBLAS_LIBRARY}"
```

```
	if test -r "${CBLAS_HEADER}/cblas.h"; then
		if test "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/include" -a "x${CBLAS_HEADER}" != "x/usr/local/include"; then

				CBLAS_LIBS="-L${CBLAS_LIBRARY} ${CBLAS_LIBS}"
			else
				CBLAS_LIBS="${CBLAS_LIBS}"
			fi

```
The current way, even with my small change in the previous comment, assume that if the header is in the standard place then the library is as well. This code makes no such assumption.

That's not quite true. It still looks for atlas if nothing is provided. Doubly so.

More precisely, the `CBLAS_LIBS="-lcblas -latlas"` is used when no `--with-cblas` option is given, which is currently the case in `spkg-install`. I think this is what we want, so I personally see no further obstructions for this ticket.

I don't agree.
Picking up the right linker flags, include path, lmib path for any CBLAS implem is black magic.
I'm not even sure the autotools suite provides anything to pick properly a working CBLAS implem on every system.
Using pkg-config could ease all of that but I wouldn't say it's an option for us or IML.

Doesn't matter if they work (I haven't tried). If they don't work for Sage, they might serve as a good starting point.

That's exactly why you want to solve this problem once, with one proper `autoconf` script. If every `spkg-install` script needs to be rewritten to detect ATLAS, you're doing it wrong.

On an old Mac (slightly newer than my usual test machine, but still OS X 10.4 PPC) iml bails out with complaining about not having ATLAS 3.0 or greater.  These built Sage 6.4.beta6 fine (other than rpy2) so it must be something about this upgrade that changes it - I assume iml always asked for that, see for instance [this nearly 8-year-old discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-forum/sHwJyMp7Wmo)!

Could it possibly be the removal of

```
--with-atlas-include="`pwd`" --with-atlas-lib=/usr/lib
```
Reading http://web.mit.edu/sage/export/iml-1.0.2/config/atlas-check.m4 certainly seems to indicate so.

Even though in general we will have to drop easy support for that old of a machine because gcc 4.0.1 won't compile gcc 4.9.x (you'd think it would have made sense for gcc to number it 5.0 when they changed the language they wrote it in!), I do want to make one final binary for Sage 6.4.1 at least, so I would appreciate any assistance.

For the record, the simple change to

```
EXTRA_BLAS=""
if [ $UNAME = "Darwin" ]; then
    # copy cblas headers from gsl
    cp ../patches/gsl_cblas.h cblas.h
    EXTRA_BLAS="--with-cblas=-lgslcblas"
fi
```
works on that older platform, apparently.
