<a id='comment:5'></a>Dear Travis,

Yes! that would be great to have a look at what is already available!

Is the hyperbolic Cartan type you mean the one of Bourbaki, Chein'69 (given in Humphreys). Where there are the compact and finite-volume fundamental chambers?

We focus more on the general implementation of Coxeter groups where it is possible to choose different values for the label "oo" for the bilinear form giving "generalized" Coxeter graphs, so no conflict in sight a priori. A classification of Lorentzian/Hyperbolic Cartan types is good to have too!

You may have a look at http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8608, where the generalized Coxeter graphs of "level 2" are classified. These Coxeter groups act on Lorentzian/hyperbolic space too. In this definition, "level 1" correspond to the union of finite-volume and compact hyperbolic Coxeter groups.

A hyperbolic Cartan type is an indefinite type, which when you remove any node, you get an affine or finite Cartan type (and compact means they are all finite type).

I want to try and mitigate conflicts and duplication (if there would be any).
