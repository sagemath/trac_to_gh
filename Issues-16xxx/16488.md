<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

On i686 architecture running Debian stable, with recent `zeromq` and `pyzmq` from #16455:

- playing by hand on various features works as expected
- `make ptestlong` pass without errors (but some MILP-related, due to a problem with CBC)

No custom patch anymore, everything looks good to me.

If someone wants to test on other archs, please do as well, otherwise i am okay for positive review.
