Hi

Just an idea:

Shouldn't it be possible to define/implement Dirichlet series by specifying a function
(from Z/ideals/whatever) for their coefficients?

I guess that would require some base class (which ideally would accept/parse/recognize
functions from Z/whatever) for the coefficient functions.
It would do parsing tasks, printing(!) of functions, arithmetic operations/dirichlet
convolutions/etc... (Completely) multiplicative functions would be a "nice" subclass.
Ideally the implementation would at least support basic Dirichlet series example.

Again: Just an idea (for either an extension or a new implementation/ticket).

Regards,
Jonas

rws:

I'm in particular hoping for an exact implementation of arithmetic/multiplicative functions:

```
id = ArithmeticFunctions().id()
sigma0 = ArithmeticFunction(lambda n: sigma0(n))
id*id == sigma0 // Dirichlet convolution
```

...

```
f = DirichletSeries(id)*DirichletSeries(id)
f == DirichletSeries(sigma0)
f[91234154]
f // nice representations:
=> sum_{n in Z} (sum_{d|n} 1)
or: sum_{n in Z} sigma0(n)
```

...

Those certainly form a nice subset of possible coefficient functions / dirichlet series.
More generally I was hoping for the possibility to specify Dirichlet series /
coefficient functions exactly, not only up to some precision.
E.g. (bad example) DirichletSeries(lambda n: sin(n))
or e.g. by specifying an (exact) generating series as e.g. a rational function

Calculating the n'th coefficient from these to get a DirichletSeries as now
is at least rather simple.

Other ideas: exact verification of identities (not only up to precision),
nice representations/output of coefficient functions after operations (hard),
support functions from ideals (TODO: figure out the correct category for the domain
of coefficient functions).

I am aware that this is not a small task and might not be easily possible in python.
But I hope you get the idea of what I had in mind...

And a third ticket.

So this ticket would prepare for the others by providing creation from expressions of a limited form (polynomial fractions with generator from `zeta(a*s+b)` and `L(c)`).

There are (at least) two different (exact) approaches:
- Coefficient functions
- Generating functions (as q-series?), I am not entirely sure what you mean by it...

I was emphasizing on the coefficient function part.
Clearly it is possible to define dirichlet series by specifying the coefficient function (as a normal function). It is even relatively simple to implement all kind of operations.
Individual coefficients could also be calculated (up to some precision).
What is hard is getting a "nice representation" (e.g. a divisor sum form as you mentioned above).
- One idea might be to somehow "decompile" a function into source code / some at least nicer form.
- One idea might be to use symbolic expression (rather limited).
- Another idea might be to implement very basic coefficient functions and allow all kind of operations with them (using ast(?)/whatever) to be as flexible as possible with the combinations (include as many of the popular examples as possible).
- Finally we could simply use the old representation by just calculating the coefficients up to some precision. The advantage would be that "precision" is no longer part of the series, only of the representation.

The relation between coefficient functions and generating series might be a challenge. I wonder what approach is more suitable. Maybe the two concepts both have interesting cases that cannot easily be translated to the other way. So maybe both ways should be supported (?).

I was thinking in very general terms ("any" function from Z). That should be fairly simple (even with operations on series) and allow the calculation of the coefficients up to an arbitrary precision. Example:

```
(F+G).cf = lambda n: F.cf(n) + G.cf(n)
(F*G).cf = lambda n: sum(F.cf(d)*G.cf(n/d) for d in divisors(n))
```

However it will be very hard to get "nice" representation of the coefficient functions.

Maybe "polynomial fractions with genertore from zeta(a*s+b) and L(c)" is more powerful, I don't know.

Side remark: *Dirichlet series* could/should be viewed as something like a *Fourier transform* of an *Arithmetic function*.

Yes but that doesn't explain how the g.f. is implemented (in an exact way).
For some families of Dirichlet series the corresponding ordinary (or exponential)
generating series could be stored as a rational function (e.g. 1/(1-q)).

I assumed you meant this when refering to g.f.
How else could you store the g.f. in an exact matter?

Just for your information:

I started some preliminary (poc) test implementation of arithmetic functions (no tests/documentation etc). The first idea was to use symbolic expressions but they don't work well together with sums which are absolutely crucial for operations on arithmetic functions...

The test implementation is available on u/jj/arith_functions:

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/526e1ae40f94cff95e5dc6926208b831643edfb4

Here is a simple example:

```
sigma3 = ArithmeticFunction(lambda n: sigma(n,3), lambda n,_: "sigma({},3)".format(n), lambda n,_: "\\sigma_{{3}}\\left({}\\right)".format(n))
sigma3^2
show(sigma3^2)
(sigma3^2)(5)

Hello,

1. there is no need to add method `dirmul` and `dirdiv` to the pari `gen` object. This is taken care automatically since #17631. Doctesting is cool thoug. But move it somewhere else.

2. Why is this new module in `sage.modular`? It makes no sense.

Because `sage.modular` is intended for modular forms. A Dirichlet serie is not necessarily a modular form. To me, modules and submodules should work by inclusion. Or at least try to.

I do not see Dirichlet series as a subset of modular forms. I perfectly understand the reason why it is here, but it would be better in `sage.functions` or `sage.rings`. The directory `sage.modular` really contains too much stuff. This is historical as people that initiated Sage were very interested in modular forms.

Note that L-function / L-series usual refer to functions / series satisfying
some very specific (more restrictive) set of axioms (AC/FE/etc) - in contrast
to Dirichlet series or abstract Dirichlet series. So there is definitely some
justification for introducing a new class (at least if it supports exact
representation).

Also if I remember correctly the L-function is not an exact representation but
also restricted by precision. What I would like to see is support for exact
abstract Dirichlet series, e.g. by using symbolic coefficient functions or
by using exact generating series in terms of rational functions.

If they are not implemented in an exact way I am curious about the background:
How / in what context will they be used? Why is a new class required?

In any case I agree that Dirichlet series don't belong to sage.modular.

Best

Hello,

6 more questions/issues.

7. Why are you importing the alias `dirichlet_series` and not `DirichletSeries` in the global namespace?

8. How do I get the coefficients of the Dirichlet L functions obtained with the command `dirichlet_L(3,2,s)`?

9. There are several issues with the documentation:
   - you forgot `::` at line 107 (in `DirichletSeries` class documentation).
   - the `INPUT` block does not follow the convention (see the developer guide, section Documentation String)
   - doctests are missing from many important functions (e.g. `base_ring`, `is_Eulerian`, `has_infinite_precision`, `list`)

10. In `__mul__` I do not understand

```
R = self.base_ring() 
try: 
    _ = RR(other)
```
  Did you want to write `R(other)`? If so it is very wrong since if you multiply `2.0` with a Dirichlet serie with rational coefficients you would end up with rational coefficients as

```
sage: QQ(3.2314)
16157/5000
```
  You should really use coercion here (i.e. the item 4 in [comment:38](#comment%3A38)) or do stronger type check such as `parent(other) is self.base_ring()`.

11. This should work

```
sage: D1 = dirichlet_series([1,1,1])
sage: D1 + 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
```
(also related to item 4 in [comment:38](#comment%3A38)).

12. What is the purpose of this nested `MaskFunction` class?

Vincent

Replying to [vdelecroix](#comment%3A52):
> 8. How do I get the coefficients of the Dirichlet L functions obtained with the command `dirichlet_L(3,2,s)`?
  
Analogous to polynomial coefficients, now added as example:

```
sage: D=dirichlet_series(dirichlet_L(3,2,s))
sage: D.list()
[1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
sage: D.list(5)
[1, -1, 0, 1, -1]
```

I haven't looked extensively at Jon's code as long as it worked.

No, this is a feature request. With this ticket you can do as well:

```
sage: D1 = dirichlet_series([1,1,1])
sage: one = dirichlet_series(1)
sage: D1 + one                                                                          
2 + 1/(2^s) + 1/(3^s) + O(4^(-s))                                                       
```
> 12. What is the purpose of this nested `MaskFunction` class?
  
As this is only of developer interest I added at l.156: 

```
                # the specific form of the factors returned by Maxima
                # (see ticket #18081) makes masking necessary
                arg = dirichlet_series._mask_exp_factors(arg)
```
The rest should be addressed with the latest commit.

I don't understand. The Dirichlet g.f. of the Moebius function is `1/zeta(s)` via `Sum_{n >= 1} mu(n)/n^s = 1/zeta(s)` so you can get it via:

```
sage: var('s')
s
sage: dirichlet_series(1/zeta(s))
1 + -1/(2^s) + -1/(3^s) + -1/(5^s) + 1/(6^s) + -1/(7^s) + 1/(10^s) + -1/(11^s) + -1/(13^s) + 1/(14^s) + 1/(15^s) + -1/(17^s) + -1/(19^s) + O(20^(-s))
sage: _.list()
[1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0]
```

The conversion from g.f. to the form Pari uses for generation is unpublished research. If I insist on a review it will never go into Sage so what do I say? I tested it on all known D.g.f.s collected from the OEIS. But there are surely future cases where it will fail.

It is only used internally for pattern matching. If there is a next version pattern matching will be done in Pynac.
