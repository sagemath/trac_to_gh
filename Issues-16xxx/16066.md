In Py2 there is the [execfile() function](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#execfile), while in Py3 there is none.

The tool 2to3 changes the  calls to execfile() to wrapped calls of the builtin `open()`, `compile` and `exec()` functions.
An example of a change `lib2to3/fixes/fix_execfile.py` is

```
-        execfile(fpath, globals)
+        exec(compile(open(fpath).read(), fpath, 'exec'), globals)
```
There are 2 occurences of execfile() in `sage/misc/preparser.py`. 


The code has to depend on the Python version!

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.
