Here is a new `input_filter` argument for cached functions which makes it remember only "some" output, depending on the input.

Could you argue that? 

I could easily imagine some could code which are usually use to compute small things but some crazy researcher could want compute big things (one times) and be exhaustive on those big things...

If there was not a "key" parameter to normalize the input I would have agreed with that. Please tell me why this feature is needed and "clean" and not mine. I was looking at it while I wrote this patch, and the cost of mine is less important.

> -1 for obscuring serious programming logic: in any non-trivial situation, you need a strategy to decide which inputs do need caching and which don't.

You can define the filter wherever you want, and make it as long and complicated as you want. And when you have defined it, how do you plan on making "cached_method" behave according to it except through the decorator ?

Come on guy, caching the output of calls which give a small output does not seem that far fetched. Why can't you see it ?

> some things seem worthwhile to cache but generally it's too expensive.

Indeed. I want to filter them out.

Just my 2 cents: I could see use cases for this feature. In particular if the caching strategy could be made configurable at runtime by the user:

```
class XXX:
    @cached_method
    def f(...): ...

XXX.f.set_input_filter(...)
```

So if this can be implemented without slowing down the standard use case, I don't see why not?

If the current implementation is deemed to introduce too large of an overhead (time+memory with the extra slot), an alternative might be to  implement this feature in a subclass, have `set_input_filter` change the class of the cached method to this subclass if needed, and have `__init__` call `set_input_filter` when relevant? If it's all pure Cython maybe changing the class is not an option; in this case we would need to choose the class once for all in the factory function, before `__init__` is called.

Cheers,

Thats still crazy, decorators are a useful metaprogramming tool but you are essentially creating two function bodies that don't / can't talk to each other. If you really want to have a decorator to help with managing the cache then make the decision to cache available inside the function body. E.g.

```python
@sometimes_cached_function
def bar(x, y, z):
   w = do_long_computation(x, y, z)
   if want_to_cache(x, y, z, w):
      bar.set_cache((x, y, z), w)  
      # or some variation thereof that uses the original arguments
   return w
```
Though really the advantage over 

```python
bar_cache = dict()

def bar(x, y, z):
    try:
        return bar_cache[(x,y,z)]
    except KeyError: 
        w = do_long_computation(x, y, z)
    if want_to_cache(x,y,z,w):
        bar_cache[(x,y,z)] = w 
    return w
```
is pretty slim. You save maybe 2 lines at the expense of making it harder to understand to somebody who doesn't know about the memoization machinery.

This ticket is not invalid, this ticket implements a feature I need, and a feature that several other developpers acknowledged as being potentially useful. I don't even get how you can honestly deny that filtering what is being cached, even if the two functions "don't talk", can be useful.

Stop this game and look at the code. It does not slow anything down because it is a new class, it solves my problem and it is clearly the kind of stuff that other persons may need too. There's no reason to refuse it a priori.

Okay. Now it's my turn. I claim that you are an eagle with 15 arms and 36 beaks, and that you own a pink bright camping-car parked right under the Eiffel Tower. The cops called you yesterday at 10:34, 11:34 and 15:30 and you refused to answer their questions pretending that you had gone mute the day before

Truths:

1) I need this feature. There's nobody that can assert it with more certainty than I. You can say that I don't many times, and truth be told, it changes nothing to the fact that I am still stuck if I can't do that.

2) I have absolutely nothing against the caching method I implement, and I never said that it was not good. I would not write a branch if I thought it was not good and useful for Sage.

Stop talking nonsense.

How do you tell which values are the most useful? Except no-argument functions, I usually don't like the wide spread of cached_method in Sage. One caching strategy that I find useful in practice for recursive functions is LRU (least recently used) cache. In Python 3 it is implement in the functools module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache and for Python 2 there are already several implementations, like the backport at http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578078-py26-and-py30-backport-of-python-33s-lru-cache/.

Trust me, not everything is a nail and there are more elegant solutions to your problem.\n\nThen write the more elegant solution.  I agree that we can have feature creep at times, and I'm sure ncohen does too, based on many comments on sage-devel.  But if there is some canonical way to do some specific example of Nathann's (obviously not the toy cases in the doctest here) then let's add *that* to the documentation, so that when other people who want to do what he does show up, they can look at a well-annotated example of why it's so horrible to do this filtering.  There's no need to browbeat.\n\n> I don't even get how you can honestly deny that filtering what is being cached, even if the two functions \"don't talk\", can be useful.\n\nYeah, I'm not sure why this can't be useful either, even if for some reason it doesn't need a new decorator.  As a non-cache-expert, I guess Volker's suggestion of\n\n```\nbar_cache = dict()\n\ndef bar(x, y, z):\n    try:\n        return bar_cache[(x,y,z)]\n    except KeyError: \n        w = do_long_computation(x, y, z)\n    if want_to_cache(x,y,z,w):\n        bar_cache[(x,y,z)] = w \n    return w\n```\nseems fine too, especially if documented somewhere.  There has to be some compromise here; it's not *that* important.  (As opposed to rewriting Sage in Ruby or something.)  \n\n---\n\nNaturally, I have no ball in the technicalities of this game.  I **do** have a ball in the game of people getting along enough to not squabble and get personal over this stuff.

Then write the more elegant solution.  I agree that we can have feature creep at times, and I'm sure ncohen does too, based on many comments on sage-devel.  But if there is some canonical way to do some specific example of Nathann's (obviously not the toy cases in the doctest here) then let's add *that* to the documentation, so that when other people who want to do what he does show up, they can look at a well-annotated example of why it's so horrible to do this filtering.  There's no need to browbeat.

> I don't even get how you can honestly deny that filtering what is being cached, even if the two functions "don't talk", can be useful.

Yeah, I'm not sure why this can't be useful either, even if for some reason it doesn't need a new decorator.  As a non-cache-expert, I guess Volker's suggestion of

```
bar_cache = dict()

def bar(x, y, z):
    try:
        return bar_cache[(x,y,z)]
    except KeyError: 
        w = do_long_computation(x, y, z)
    if want_to_cache(x,y,z,w):
        bar_cache[(x,y,z)] = w 
    return w
```
seems fine too, especially if documented somewhere.  There has to be some compromise here; it's not *that* important.  (As opposed to rewriting Sage in Ruby or something.)

Naturally, I have no ball in the technicalities of this game.  I **do** have a ball in the game of people getting along enough to not squabble and get personal over this stuff.  ["The open source community is just so fricking nice"](https://plus.google.com/110464871801965858778/posts/LTnYFQg1fnc) is what we want people to think about when they think of Sage community.

If you want to cache bar and not baz then just provide two different functions. And if you can't split up the function easily because they are multiple-page case switches then you need to refactor them regardless of the caching.

so maybe some of the problem is external to this particular ticket?  Maybe in the other review one could ask for a second opinion from elsewhere, always a reasonable thing to do.
> designs.orthogonal_array doesn't return some kind of array

Probably that is the real problem.  In the current stable branch,

```
def orthogonal_array(k,n,t=2,check=True):
    r"""
    Return an orthogonal array of parameters `k,n,t`.
```
And I don't see anywhere in the code, or doctested, that you should get a boolean or an integer.  This must be a recent thing (I do see it in 6.3.beta3) and I would definitely agree that was bad design.  It seems that #16286 and #15310 were the culprits, I have found it now.  (Note to Volker - all those git-induced commits made it very, very hard to track down what should have been extremely straightforward in such a new file!  Oh well, I'll get there eventually.)

That doesn't mean one can't have a cache with selective memory, but maybe we can disentangle that from the very strange decision made there.

Just adding something : unless this ticket is reviewed I will have to implement the caching method manually in 4 different functions.

I also forgot to add another reason for having a function like that :

A cached function cannot (safely) return mutable answers. If you return a list and that the user modifies the list, then it also modifies the list stored in the function's cache.

Thus, as my functions return some mutable answers (lists) which I do not want to cache but I am forced to, I have to turn them into tuples before returning them (which again triggers useless copies later). With the 10 lines from this branch I would be able to say that I don't want to cache those answers. Which I never wanted to cache anyway.

Just saying...

It is not an internal routine.

Understand what you want to understand. I am telling you that I will have to implement 4 times the same code in different functions, and that all my problems could be solved with the clear and understandable lines that this branch implements, at absolutely no cost for anybody else.

The code will less clear because of that, the design files will contain code dedicated to caching that does not belong there, and of course I will be implementing manually what could be done by a decorator.

Waste of time.

How can you tell from the input parameters whether the caller is going to mutate the result you're returning? Surely a non-internal routine will have uniform input/output specifications, i.e., always return either mutable types or immutable types?

> How can you tell from the input parameters whether the caller is going to mutate the result you're returning?

`O_O`

It is simple :

1) If I can use the feature implemented in this branch

--> I can only cache the return values I am interested in caching (they are boolean-->immutable) and I can return other values as mutable types, which is their most natural type.

2) If I cannot use the feature implemented in this branch, I have to use cached_method

--> Thus I have to cache everything that my function returns, and so I cannot return immutables types anymore. And I have to return tuples of tuples instead of lists, which complicated matters uselessly.

> Surely a non-internal routine will have uniform input/output specifications, i.e., always return either mutable types or immutable types?

No. My function returns booleans or lists of lists, depending on what the user asks. If I have to make it tuples of tuples and cache them for naught, it's a waste for everybody.

With this branch, I can cache only what I want and not have to change what my function returns to fit the cached_method's needs.

This ticket is not really waiting for a review, given that it has been refused in its current form. As Karl-Dieter does not want it to be closed as wontfix, I set it to `needs_work` until somebody changes the implementation. The problem in the combinatorial designs code has been fixed with a specific caching system.

This seems reasonable.
