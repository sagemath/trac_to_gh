```
Currently the following fails:

```
sage: x = QQ['x'].gen()
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: K.<b> = F.extension(x^2-3)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,0,0,b,1])
sage: E.rank()
```

This is because the sage function wrapping around Denis Simon's two-descent script does not consider relative number fields.

I propose an easy fix for it.
