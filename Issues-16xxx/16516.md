Hi Bruno,

It seems reasonable to have it in `integer_ring.pyx`. And I think that it would be good to allow it for dense polynomial as well. You certainly know what is the good measure of sparseness... you could implement a method `.density()` of `.sparness_XYZ()` on polynomials that would help you to find the good threshold for the different algorithms.

For better code, please:
- remove the trailing whitespaces
- there is no need for `;` at the end of each line
- for list update it is better to use `.append(x)` for adding one element and `.extend(iterator)` for extending with several elements
- `not ring is None` -> `ring is not None` (the `is not` is a Python operator)

And you must provide timings to see whether it is better with your code for small input. You can use the command `timeit` as in

```
sage: R.<T> = ZZ[]
sage: p = R.random_element(degree=10)
sage: timeit("p.roots()")
625 loops, best of 3: 223 µs per loop
```

It would be nice to make the following works:

```
sage: R.<T> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = R.random_element(degree=10)
sage: p.roots(QQbar)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Polynomial_generic_sparse' object has no attribute 'gcd'
```

It will be a nice thing to have in Sage!

More remarks to come,
Vincent

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:7'></a>\nHi Vincent,\n\nThanks for the comments. I pushed a new version taking them into account, especially for the \"better code\" part.\n\nFor roots over QQbar, I think it is not really related to this ticket. It is related to #15790 (implementation of GCD for sparse polynomials). I'd like to work in this other ticket too.\n\nNow for the most complicate part (to my mind), timings. The issue is the following: Whether the new algorithm is better than the previous one is not a matter of density. For instance, if you have `p = 3 - x + x^7 * q` where `q` is a very high-degree dense polynomial, integer roots of `p` are common roots of `3-x` and `q`. And the same thing may happen *in the middle* of a polynomial. In a sense, the only way to detect such things is to use the loop in the algorithm. Of course, for low-degree random polynomials, this will make the algorithm slower. \n\nFor the discussion, I refer to the previous algorithm \n`self._roots_from_factorization(...)` \nas the *dense algorithm*, and the new algorithm I implemented as the *sparse algorithm*. \n\nI did tests: \n* In the first one, the roots are computed using the dense algorithm and then the sparse algorithm, and I compute the ratio of the time it takes. The ration is `>1` if the sparse algorithm is worst than the dense one. The left column is the degree, and then 10 tests are performed with random polynomial of the given degree. As you can see, the sparse algorithm is often worst, by a factor between 1.5 and 3, and is sometimes better by a factor of 10 to 25.\n* In the second one, I added a condition of the sparsity (i.e. number of nonzero terms) of the polynomial: `if p.degree() - p.sparsity() - p.valuation() < 10`, I use the dense algorithm. The timings are then almost equal for both algorithm for small degrees, but sometimes (not as often as for the first test) the new algorithm is much better. For large degrees, we get the same kind of results as in the first test.\n\nAs a consequence of these tests, I do not know how the algorithm should be chosen. Do you have any idea (or any idea of which other tests I should perform to be able to chose)? \n\nFinally, I also use the fact that a nonzero root of an integer polynomial should divide its lowest-degree coefficient (constant coefficient if the valuation is zero) to accelerate the computations. On the one hand, if the absolute value `cst_coeff` of the constant coefficient is small, the dense algorithm can compute the product `q` of the `(x-i)*(x+i)` for `1 <= i <= cst_coeff` and compute the roots of the `gcd` of `self` and `q` instead of `q`. My tests show that it really improves the computation time. (Note yet that because of #15790, this cannot work for the moment with sparse polynomials.) On the other hand, in the sparse algorithm, it is useless to compute the split of `self` into a list `polys` when the `cst_coeff` is `1`.\n\n## Tests\n### First test:\n\n```\n2 [1.80, 2.15, 2.27,

Hi Vincent,

Thanks for the comments. I pushed a new version taking them into account, especially for the "better code" part.

For roots over QQbar, I think it is not really related to this ticket. It is related to #15790 (implementation of GCD for sparse polynomials). I'd like to work in this other ticket too.

Now for the most complicate part (to my mind), timings. The issue is the following: Whether the new algorithm is better than the previous one is not a matter of density. For instance, if you have `p = 3 - x + x^7 * q` where `q` is a very high-degree dense polynomial, integer roots of `p` are common roots of `3-x` and `q`. And the same thing may happen *in the middle* of a polynomial. In a sense, the only way to detect such things is to use the loop in the algorithm. Of course, for low-degree random polynomials, this will make the algorithm slower. 

For the discussion, I refer to the previous algorithm 
`self._roots_from_factorization(...)` 
as the *dense algorithm*, and the new algorithm I implemented as the *sparse algorithm*. 

I did tests: 
* In the first one, the roots are computed using the dense algorithm and then the sparse algorithm, and I compute the ratio of the time it takes. The ration is `>1` if the sparse algorithm is worst than the dense one. The left column is the degree, and then 10 tests are performed with random polynomial of the given degree. As you can see, the sparse algorithm is often worst, by a factor between 1.5 and 3, and is sometimes better by a factor of 10 to 25.
* In the second one, I added a condition of the sparsity (i.e. number of nonzero terms) of the polynomial: `if p.degree() - p.sparsity() - p.valuation() < 10`, I use the dense algorithm. The timings are then almost equal for both algorithm for small degrees, but sometimes (not as often as for the first test) the new algorithm is much better. For large degrees, we get the same kind of results as in the first test.

As a consequence of these tests, I do not know how the algorithm should be chosen. Do you have any idea (or any idea of which other tests I should perform to be able to chose)? 

Finally, I also use the fact that a nonzero root of an integer polynomial should divide its lowest-degree coefficient (constant coefficient if the valuation is zero) to accelerate the computations. On the one hand, if the absolute value `cst_coeff` of the constant coefficient is small, the dense algorithm can compute the product `q` of the `(x-i)*(x+i)` for `1 <= i <= cst_coeff` and compute the roots of the `gcd` of `self` and `q` instead of `q`. My tests show that it really improves the computation time. (Note yet that because of #15790, this cannot work for the moment with sparse polynomials.) On the other hand, in the sparse algorithm, it is useless to compute the split of `self` into a list `polys` when the `cst_coeff` is `1`.

Hi,

**Global remarks:**

1) You seem to have a global problem with the difference between `==` and `is` so have a look at [python-is-operator on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13650293/python-is-operator).

2) 
Comment your code when it is complicated like

```
if cst_coeff is not ZZ(1):
    i_min=0
    polys=[]

    for i in xrange(1,k):
        if e[i]-e[i-1] > c_max.nbits():
            polys.append(R(p[ e[i_min]:e[i] ].shift(-e[i_min])))
            i_min=i
            c_max=c[i].abs()
        else:
            c_max=max(c[i].abs(),c_max)
    polys.append(R(p[ e[i_min]:1+e[k-1] ].shift(-e[i_min])))
```
open softwares should also be readable softwares

3) You have syntax error in the documentation (which will create error when you try to build the documentation with "make doc"):

```
``algorithm'' -- the algorithm to use
```
should be

```
``algorithm`` -- the algorithm to use
```
ie open and close with back quotes.


**Specific ones:**

4) In the method sparsity that you implemented in "polynomial_element.pyx", the variable c is not initialized. So

```
sage: K.<x>=QQ[]
sage: (x^7 + x^3 + 1).sparsity()
32665
```
Moreover, the following test is not safe at all

```
if l.pop() is not zero
```
you can not believe that the zero always occupy the same memory. For instance

```
sage: K = QQ['x']
sage: K.zero().constant_coefficient() is QQ.zero()
False
```
Moreover, using try except is totally useless in that case... You might be inspired by the implementation of `coefficients`. Hopefully, I am not the one who teach you programming at school ;-) Please test this method with other base rings (at least QQ, QQbar, ZZ/nZZ GF(p), GF(p^n)).

5) Are you sure that the term sparsity is standard? I would rather go for something more explicit like "num_nonzero_coefficients" or something similar. I hoped to find a similar method in matrices but did not find it.

6) In your function `_roots_univariate_polynomial`, there is no gain in using `xrange` instead of `range`. But there will be a **big** one if you define `k` as an int!

6) Using the `gcd` from `sage.rings.arith` (in the line `p=gcd(p,q)`) is slow compared to `p = p.gcd(q)`. (and do not forget to remove the import)

<a id='comment:10'></a>
7) the method `.extend()` of lists do not return anything as you can see

```
sage: [0].extend([1])
```
so there is a problem in the case algorithm "dense_with_gcd" in your function `_roots_univariate_polynomial`.

8) How can you divide by the content??

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, sparse=True)
sage: p = (x^7 + x^3 + 1)
sage: p.content()
Principal ideal (1) of Integer Ring
sage:  (x^7 + x^3 + 1) / p.content()
```
EDIT: my mistake. This is a **bug** in the code of polynomials: the method content must either return an ideal or a number but not one or the other depending on the implementation...

Nevertheless, you should test all cases of your code within the documentation!!

2) *Comment the code:* Done

3) *Syntax error in the doc:* Done. "make doc" works now.

4) *Method `sparsity` in "polynomial_element.pyx":* I totally changed the method since it was obviously badly written. I wanted to avoid constructing a list of nonzero monomials to get a better complexity but this was not a good idea! I hope the new (much simpler!) version is fine. I add quite a lot of tests in this function (as well as in others).

Hi Bruno,

I started modifying the code by myself. For that I opened a branch at `u/vdelecroix/16516`. You can fetch from this one and adopt my commit if you like it (using `git pull` inside your branch). I describe the changes below

0) I update above sage.6.3

1) Be careful, you use too often the "is" where "==" is needed:
first example strings are not unique representation

```
sage: "dense" is "dense"
True
sage: other_dense = "denseX"[:-1]
sage: "dense" == other_dense
True
sage: "dense" is other_dense
False
```
second example: you wrote

```
if g.is_zero(): # could also use the slightly faster 
                # "g is R.zero_element()" since it is cached
```
But the zero of R is not unique

```
sage: (ZZ(1) - ZZ(1)) is ZZ(0)
False
```
(though in that case, I only had to remove the comment)

2) pep8 recommands to have spaces `x = y` instead of `x=y`

3) It is not needed to copy/paste doctests (that would imply that the code is tested twice and hence multiply the test timings by two). I modified the documentation of `sparsity` appropriately.

I guess this is soon finished. Could you redo the exact timings you did?

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

I accept your changes, thank you for the work! 

For the timings, I did the following tests, with the results attached as `.txt` files. I tested `p.roots(algorithm="...")` for random polynomials `p` of degree 2 to 98, where the algorithm is either `"sparse"` or `"dense"`. I computed the ratio between the two timings (smaller than 1 says `"sparse"` is better). There are four different files:

* I ran the tests either with a check `p.degree() - p.sparsity() - p.valuation() < 10` or without this test: The files are named `..._test.txt` in the first case and `..._no_test.txt` in the second one.
* I ran the tests with polynomials in `PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=True)` (files `sparse_pol_...`) and `PolynomialRing(ZZ,sparse=False)` (files `dense_pol_...`).

To redo the same tests, here is the code I used:

```python
nb = 3
for degre in xrange(2,100,2):
    liste = []
    for _ in xrange(10):
        p = R.random_element(degre) 
        t1 = timeit("p.roots(algorithm=\"sparse\")",seconds=True,number=nb)
        t2 = timeit("p.roots(algorithm=\"dense\")",seconds=True,number=nb)
        liste.append(QQ(t1/t2).n(digits=3))
    print degre, liste, min(liste), sum(liste)/len(liste), max(liste)
``` 

To read the results, the lines looks like:

```
2 [0.939, 0.392, 0.523, 1.51, 1.17, 1.25, 1.17, 0.517, 0.503, 0.855] 0.392 0.884 1.51
``` 
where the 5 elements are (in order):
1. the degree of the polynomials (here 2);
2. list of 10 ratios corresponding to 10 independent tests;
3. minimum of the list;
4. average of the list;
5. maximum of the list.


My conclusion is that we shall always use the sparse algorithm (at least for sparsely represented polynomials) without making any test such as the one I did in the timings. Do you agree?

Note: I did not check this really but the better timings may quite often come from the test on the constant coefficient ("is it ±1?") that I do but is not done in the other `roots` function. In random polynomials, the constant coefficient is 1 with probability 2/5.

A comment to build on my final note in the previous comment:

First, what is important is not only the constant coefficient but the lowest degree nonzero coefficient, which equals ±1 with probability 1/2 for `R.random_polynomial(degree)` for `R` some polynomial ring. I made once again the same tests, but with the 5th line replaced by

```python
        p = R.random_element(degre,-1000,1000)
```

such that the lowest degree nonzero coefficient in ±1 with probability 1/999 (if I am not mistaken). Note also that the polynomials are very dense since the coefficient 0 appears only with probability 1/1999. The results are of course different (I put just a very few of them to get an idea):

Hello Bruno,

In dense_pol_test, the entries looks like being either 1 or 0.001 in magnitude. Do you know what makes the sparse algorithm better in the second case?

How did you generate your random polynomials? The output of `random_polynomial` is by definition a **dense** polynomial, i.e. all coefficients are non-zero. In order to test your algorithm you must look at **sparse** polynomial, i.e. when only 10% of the coefficients are nonzero. The datastructure (i.e. `PolynomialRing(sparse=False)` vs `PolynomialRing(sparse=True)`) should not play an important role in that game.

As you can see

```
sage: %runfile random_polynomial.py   # home made random_integer_polynomial
sage: p = random_integer_polynomial(degree=100, density=0.1)
sage: p.sparsity()
7
sage: timeit("p.roots(algorithm='dense')")
125 loops, best of 3: 5.59 ms per loop
sage: timeit("p.roots(algorithm='sparse')")
625 loops, best of 3: 242 µs per loop
```
(be careful, I had to change a line in the code in order to be able to use dense/sparse alternative here).

Do you know what makes the sparse algorithm better in the second case?\n\nActually, there are two possibilities which both occur for the sparse algorithm to beat the dense one: \n* Either some low-degree monomial has a zero coefficient: In such case, the sparse algorithm splits the input polynomial into a low-degree polynomial and another one (of larger degree), then take their gcd and compute the roots. This is faster than the dense algorithm and here this really exploit the sparsity of the polynomial to speed-up the computation. For instance, if the constant coefficient is nonzero and the linear coefficient is zero, the sparse algorithm boils down to computing the roots of a monomial which is of course very fast. \n* Or, and this does not exploit sparsity at all, the constant coefficient is \u00b11: In this case, there is a kind of trivial optimization in my code to only test for the possible roots -1, 0 and 1. This is sensible in the tests I made since the constant coefficient (or more accurately the lowest degree monomial) is 1 with probability 1/2. \n\n### Tests\n\nI redid some tests with polynomials of smaller density. My code for producing random polynomial of given density and degree is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef random_element_with_density(R,deg,dens):\n    K = R.base_ring()\n    p = {}\n    c = K.random_element()\n    while c == 0: c = K.random_element()\n    p[deg]=c\n    while len(p) < dens * deg:\n        e = ZZ.random_element(deg)\n        if p.has_key(e):\n            continue\n        c = K.random_element()\n        if c == 0:\n            continue\n        p[e] = c\n    return R(p)\n```\n\nFirst, I did the same tests as before but with density 1/10. (The results are inverse of before, that is `>1` means the sparse algorithm is faster. Moreover, all the tests are made without any condition of the form `if p.degree() - p.sparsity() - p.valuation() < 10`.) I display only some results for concision:\n\n```\n5 [3.04, 3.42, 3.59, 3.77, 3.36, 3.54, 3.44, 4.01, 3.47, 3.88] 3.04 3.55 4.01\n25 [10.2, 1.44, 2.16, 4.05, 4.42, 5.22, 3.71, 3.65, 1.53, 1.48] 1.44 3.79 10.2\n45 [11.1, 1.89, 10.6, 5.16, 5.64, 16.3, 7.58, 12.4, 2.35, 12.0] 1.89 8.50 16.3\n65 [10.8, 20.9, 21.3, 22.6, 12.4, 22.3, 10.9, 7.10, 25.1, 5.49] 5.49 15.9 25.1\n85 [40.5, 12.0, 40.3, 41.9, 23.7, 30.2, 21.5, 5.25, 14.4, 4.98] 4.98 23.5 41.9\n```\n\nTo come up with the second source of improvement (which has nothing to do with sparsity), I did the same test after removing the condition `if not cst_coeff.abs().is_one()`:\n\n```\n5 [3.15, 3.37, 3.79, 3.05, 3.48, 3.43, 3.42, 3.43, 3.38, 3.45] 3.05 3.39 3.79\n25 [3.16, 1.84, 2.62, 1.48, 1.53, 1.37, 2.63, 1.73, 1.82, 3.64] 1.37 2.18 3.64\n45 [4.15, 12.5, 5.01, 12.4, 5.31, 4.47, 5.57, 8.59, 5.49, 4.65] 4.15 6.82 12.5\n65 [24.1, 13.8, 15.2, 11.0, 6.08, 13.7, 23.8, 13.0, 1.62, 14.2] 1.62 13.7 24.1\n85 [29.2, 29.5, 18.0, 19.4, 30.0, 10.1, 25.8, 21.3, 7.81, 30.6] 7.81 22.2 30.6\n```\n\nAs you can see, there is still an improvement though a lesser one.\n\nFinally, I did the same comparisons of algorithms with different densities.

Salut Vincent,

> In dense_pol_test, the entries looks like being either 1 or 0.001 in magnitude. Do you know what makes the sparse algorithm better in the second case?

Actually, there are two possibilities which both occur for the sparse algorithm to beat the dense one: 
* Either some low-degree monomial has a zero coefficient: In such case, the sparse algorithm splits the input polynomial into a low-degree polynomial and another one (of larger degree), then take their gcd and compute the roots. This is faster than the dense algorithm and here this really exploit the sparsity of the polynomial to speed-up the computation. For instance, if the constant coefficient is nonzero and the linear coefficient is zero, the sparse algorithm boils down to computing the roots of a monomial which is of course very fast. 
* Or, and this does not exploit sparsity at all, the constant coefficient is ±1: In this case, there is a kind of trivial optimization in my code to only test for the possible roots -1, 0 and 1. This is sensible in the tests I made since the constant coefficient (or more accurately the lowest degree monomial) is 1 with probability 1/2. 

### Tests

I redid some tests with polynomials of smaller density. My code for producing random polynomial of given density and degree is as follows:

```python
def random_element_with_density(R,deg,dens):
    K = R.base_ring()
    p = {}
    c = K.random_element()
    while c == 0: c = K.random_element()
    p[deg]=c
    while len(p) < dens * deg:
        e = ZZ.random_element(deg)
        if p.has_key(e):
            continue
        c = K.random_element()
        if c == 0:
            continue
        p[e] = c
    return R(p)
```

First, I did the same tests as before but with density 1/10. (The results are inverse of before, that is `>1` means the sparse algorithm is faster. Moreover, all the tests are made without any condition of the form `if p.degree() - p.sparsity() - p.valuation() < 10`.) I display only some results for concision:

```
5 [3.04, 3.42, 3.59, 3.77, 3.36, 3.54, 3.44, 4.01, 3.47, 3.88] 3.04 3.55 4.01
25 [10.2, 1.44, 2.16, 4.05, 4.42, 5.22, 3.71, 3.65, 1.53, 1.48] 1.44 3.79 10.2
45 [11.1, 1.89, 10.6, 5.16, 5.64, 16.3, 7.58, 12.4, 2.35, 12.0] 1.89 8.50 16.3
65 [10.8, 20.9, 21.3, 22.6, 12.4, 22.3, 10.9, 7.10, 25.1, 5.49] 5.49 15.9 25.1
85 [40.5, 12.0, 40.3, 41.9, 23.7, 30.2, 21.5, 5.25, 14.4, 4.98] 4.98 23.5 41.9
```

To come up with the second source of improvement (which has nothing to do with sparsity), I did the same test after removing the condition `if not cst_coeff.abs().is_one()`:

```
5 [3.15, 3.37, 3.79, 3.05, 3.48, 3.43, 3.42, 3.43, 3.38, 3.45] 3.05 3.39 3.79
25 [3.16, 1.84, 2.62, 1.48, 1.53, 1.37, 2.63, 1.73, 1.82, 3.64] 1.37 2.18 3.64
45 [4.15, 12.5, 5.01, 12.4, 5.31, 4.47, 5.57, 8.59, 5.49, 4.65] 4.15 6.82 12.5
65 [24.1, 13.8, 15.2, 11.0, 6.08, 13.7, 23.8, 13.0, 1.62, 14.2] 1.62 13.7 24.1
85 [29.2, 29.5, 18.0, 19.4, 30.0, 10.1, 25.8, 21.3, 7.81, 30.6] 7.81 22.2 30.6
```

As you can see, there is still an improvement though a lesser one.

Finally, I did the same comparisons of algorithms with different densities. Each line corresponds to a degree and each column to a density. Each entry in the following tables is an average of 30 tests for the corresponding degree and density. The first table is with the "trivial optimization" and the second one without. You can see that without the optimization, the sparse algorithm becomes worse when the density is close to 1.

You really should document this:

```
if ring is not self and ring is not None:
    return None
```
and related

```diff
- return K._roots_univariate_polynomial(self, ring=ring, multiplicities=multiplicities, algorithm=algorithm)
+ ret = K._roots_univariate_polynomial(self, ring=ring, multiplicities=multiplicities, algorithm=algorithm)
+ if ret is not None: return ret
```

You could also seriously consider changing `return None` to the more Pythonic `raise NotImplementedError`.

When a method has an `algorithm` argument, you should document the possible values for `algorithm` and say what the default is. Also, you need to doctest those various options for `algorithm` and reject bad values such as `algorithm="foobar"`.

I have the feeling that "density" is for a ratio. In my case, what I'd like to denote is the number of terms, not the number of terms divided by some quantity such as the "maximal number of possible terms" (if such a thing can be defined).

I've tried to take your other comments into account. Please let me know!

And I have the feeling that "sparsity" should be a larger value if the polynomial is more sparse. In my intuition, the "sparsity" of a polynomial like `x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + ... + x + 1` would be 0 since it's absolutely not sparse.

How about `number_of_terms()`?

I've made the changes suggested.

The delicate point, from the beginning, is to automatically choose which algorithm to use. The choice I made is to always go through the sparse algorithm when no algorithm is specified. As you can see on the file [extensive_tests.sobj](http://www.lirmm.fr/~grenet/extensive_tests.sobj) ~~I attached~~,¹ the proportion of polynomials for which the sparse algorithm is slower than the dense algorithm is very small. Actually, I made the timings a second time with the exact same polynomials, and I finally found only 9 polynomials (out of 24900) for which the sparse algorithm is slower with a ratio >1.2.

¹ The object is a list of triples `(p,t1,t2)` where `p` is a polynomial, `t1` the timing (in seconds) with the dense algorithm and `t2` the timing with the sparse algorithm.

[edit: answer to the newest comment of jdemeyer] What do you mean by this?

I changed the following aspects of my code:

* Replace each `<>` by `!=`
* Add `sig_on`/`sig_off`'s
* Remove the tests on the constant coefficient: This was a hack to speed up some computations (when the constant coefficient is `±1`), but this leads to the slow down noticed by [jdemeyer](#comment%3A38) for the roots of `(x-1)^2000`. It had nothing to do with the `"sparse"` algorithm. (More on this in the note below.)

Minor comments:

- Mark the docstring with `r"""` and

  ```diff
  -Returns the root of the univariate polynomial ``p''.
  +Return the root of the univariate polynomial ``p``.
  ```
- <code>\`_roots_from_factorization\`</code> should either be <code>:meth:\`_roots_from_factorization\`</code> or <code>\`\`_roots_from_factorization\`\`</code> as it is not latex code.
- `ZZ` -> <code>\`\ZZ\`</code>.
- No semicolons needed and our error messages star with a lowercase to match python:

  ```diff
  raise ValueError("Roots of 0 are not defined");
  raise ValueError("roots of 0 are not defined")
  ```
- Jeroen can probably explain it better than me, but he has told me you should try to avoid wrapping any Python code in `sig_on`/`sig_off` as it is not needed. Since almost all of this looks like Python or Cython files that should be interruptible, I don't think many of them are necessary. You might want to ask him about this though.
- You should move the reference to the master reference file.

Bruno, your `sig_on/sig_off` handling is terribly wrong. For example in ` def _roots_univariate_polynomial` you have

```
sig_on()
roots = p._roots_from_factorization(p.factor(), multiplicities)
sig_off()
```
There is a **lot** of Python code between this `sig_on` and `sig_off` (here I count 4). Basically, the code between `sig_on` sand `sig_off` should not involve any Python object (this is not formally true but a good advice to follow). Moreover, in this particular case interruption should work perfectly fine **without** `sig_on/sig_off`.

The only cases where you should use it is
- in a portion of your code where you use only C objects and that can potentially takes time

```
cdef int n
sig_on()
while some_condition:
   n = n + 3
sig_off()
```
- a call to a C function that can be long

```
my_arg1 = my_py_object._my_C_attribute1
my_arg2 = my_py_object._my_C_attribute2
sig_on()
my_c_function(my_arg1, my_arg2)
sig_off()

Agg...trac logged me out before I posted my message. Now I don't want to rewrite my long message.

Short version:

- I removed `sig_on`/`sig_off` everywhere because it was calling Python functions (which should by C/Cython functions).
- I fixed a bug when it was fully dense but had a positive valuation (see added doctest).
- I reorganized the ordering of the code so special cases are more quickly handled.
- Got some speed out of the generic polynomial methods.
- Used `self._parent` in `Polynomial` instead of `self.parent()` because the former is relatively much faster. We can't do this in the special Python methods because of how Cython handles them.
