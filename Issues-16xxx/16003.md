Update Jmol to Jmol-14.0.13 which supplies the JSmol pure javascript version of Jmol.  Utilizing this requires significant changes to how the notebook utilizes Jmol/JSmol.  The notebook changes are in ticket #16004.

In addition to the updates to the new-style SPKG, the tar.gz from Jmol needs to be renamed before it matches the Sage standards.  The Jmol project distributes a large number of different archives.  The appropriate one for this SPKG is the Jmol-14.0.13-binary.tar.gz, which needs to be renamed to jmol-14.0.13.tar.gz (note the lower case "j").  The Jmol archive can be downloaded using this direct link [Jmol-14.0.13-binary.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/Version%2014.0/Version%2014.0.13/).  Rename and place in "upstream" directory.

This will break the current Jmol in the notebook as a serious reorganization of supporting files was required to support both java and javascript live 3-D.

After adding the new jmol-14.0.13.tar.gz to the upstream directory checkout this ticket and install the package.

```
$./sage -dev checkout --ticket 16003
$ ./sage -f jmol 
```

To test you will need the updates to the notebook as well.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Hello,

I have rebased on 6.3.rc1.

By the way, in #12212, I have asked the jmol team for a change to handle colored surfaces. Maybe it would be worth waiting for that, if this does not takes too long.

Weirdly, I do not see this problem when using a Jmol (from command line, of course) - it seems to acquire the correct info from system itself.  So in principle we don't even have to change this.

I think this is ready for positive review as long as it actually applies properly, and of course pending #16004 or some variant thereof.

This is about `SageMenu.mnu` - in the notebook Jmols it also finds this info fine until we switch to the custom one, very weird.  I'm trying to figure out where that `.mnu` file is defined but the one at the Jmol website is clearly several (major) versions out of date.

To say this more clearly, I believe the new jmol interface uses js even for Java applets when used on the web (not command line), so one would have to reorganize in any case.  Also, I don't know that there are enough other goodies to make the Jmol update worthwhile, per se.

Frederic, it seems that 14.2.5 is not out yet? Since you seem to know upstream, maybe you can suggest that they put jsmol uncompressed inside their archive, and not a zip-with-tar file.

That seems reasonable; Jonathan, did you have a reason for including that?  Maybe it's just because that's how upstream packages it...
