Update Jmol to Jmol-14.0.13 which supplies the JSmol pure javascript version of Jmol.  Utilizing this requires significant changes to how the notebook utilizes Jmol/JSmol.  The notebook changes are in ticket #16004.

In addition to the updates to the new-style SPKG, the tar.gz from Jmol needs to be renamed before it matches the Sage standards.  The Jmol project distributes a large number of different archives.  The appropriate one for this SPKG is the Jmol-14.0.13-binary.tar.gz, which needs to be renamed to jmol-14.0.13.tar.gz (note the lower case "j").  The Jmol archive can be downloaded using this direct link [Jmol-14.0.13-binary.tar.gz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol/Version%2014.0/Version%2014.0.13/).  Rename and place in "upstream" directory.

This will break the current Jmol in the notebook as a serious reorganization of supporting files was required to support both java and javascript live 3-D.

After adding the new jmol-14.0.13.tar.gz to the upstream directory checkout this ticket and install the package.

```
$./sage -dev checkout --ticket 16003
$ ./sage -f jmol 
```

To test you will need the updates to the notebook as well.

So probably this one could be even further updated in time for Sage 6.4, which has started its cycle.

According to Robert Hanson, the 18th of August 2014, 

the change useful for #12212 is now in Jmol 14.3.6 here :

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol-beta/Jmol%2014.3/Jmol%2014.3.6/

(which seems to be a beta version).

Given that #12212 maybe still needs a tiny bit of care and that probably the jmol support should be a separate ticket, maybe it's easier to just review this "as is".

You are correct, that will have to be hand-edited whenever we decide the final version here.

Also, this needs to be updated for #14364 now, it seems.  I made the change to my local one but I'm not sure if I made a mistake in merging this one - I'm surprised it showed up again for some reason.

Weirdly, I do not see this problem when using a Jmol (from command line, of course) - it seems to acquire the correct info from system itself.  So in principle we don't even have to change this.

I think this is ready for positive review as long as it actually applies properly, and of course pending #16004 or some variant thereof.

This is about `SageMenu.mnu` - in the notebook Jmols it also finds this info fine until we switch to the custom one, very weird.  I'm trying to figure out where that `.mnu` file is defined but the one at the Jmol website is clearly several (major) versions out of date.

To say this more clearly, I believe the new jmol interface uses js even for Java applets when used on the web (not command line), so one would have to reorganize in any case.  Also, I don't know that there are enough other goodies to make the Jmol update worthwhile, per se.

Yes, the changes for #12212 are not yet in a release, they are in fact in there:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol-beta/Jmol%2014.3/Jmol%2014.3.6/

I am not sure to know "upstream". I have had a private mail exchange about #12212 with somebody who was very reactive and efficient, and had the power to include changes in the latest jmol beta. I can give you his name and mail if you send me a private mail.

That seems reasonable; Jonathan, did you have a reason for including that?  Maybe it's just because that's how upstream packages it...
