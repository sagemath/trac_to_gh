To be more precise, IMHO both a and b should be < n<sup>1/2</sup> (for `two_squares()`).

I don't think anybody would expect e.g. `two_squares(25)` to return the trivial solution `(0,5)` instead of `(3,4)`.

From a number-theory point of view, there is nothing wrong with `(0,5)`. In fact, in some cases, the only solution is the "trivial" one, for example for 9.

I guess you're right, but I decided to do everything in PARI for speed, also with the idea that the code could be changed to use direct calls to the PARI library if needed.

As mentioned, depends on how you specify two_squares().

From a user perspective, I think there should be some optional argument `no_trivial_solutions`, as feeding the function with perfect squares otherwise doesn't make much sense.

I agree.  Given that 0 is a square, it makes complete sense to allow it as a term in a sum of squares.  That convention makes a lot of things nicer, for example:
- every square is also a sum of two squares, and more generally every sum of *k* squares is also a sum of *k* + 1 squares;
- *n* is a sum of 2 squares if and only if *n* can be factored non-trivially in **Z**[*i*];
- *n* is a sum of *k* squares if and only if the lattice **Z**<sup>*k*</sup> has a point of squared distance *n* from the origin.
There are also nice formulae for the number of ways to write *n* as a sum of *k* squares if you interpret this number as the number of points (*x*<sub>1</sub> , ... , *x*<sub>k</sub>) in **Z**<sup>*k*</sup> with *x*<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ... + *x<sub>k</sub>*<sup>2</sup> = *n*.

`algorithm="gap"`?

We'd need that for backwards compatibility anyway, besides that you said GAP is faster (in factoring at least) for some (which kind of?) inputs.

Minor correction: `while ii <= n` (such that we get "trivial" solutions with `j==0` as well).  Also, I'd swap i and j, or `return (j,i)`.

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hello,

I implemented what I said in Cython (i.e. `two_squares_pyx`, `three_squares_pyx` and `four_squares_pyx`). Timings are now much better for small values (but it also influences small values).

Based on the timings below (with the old version), I put the threshold to 500 for the three functions. But if you have strong opinion for another threshold please tell me. 

There are many comments, but is there somebody up for a review ?

Sorry, I had been looking at some diff of Vincent's code against yours, and only saw some `return (foo,)` (and I **swear** it was more than one!1!!1 ;-) ), but in your original code, or the one that's again here now, it's of course only in the case k=1 (sum of *one* square), which is correct.

Sorry for the noise.

<a id='comment:42'></a>Hi,

Related to comment:12, can you justify why using pari? We already have `factor` and `is_pseudoprime` and `sqrtrem` might be the replacement for `N.sqrtint`.

There are also trailing whitespaces on the lines 5161 and 5246.
