Nevertheless, intersection and union are still not implemented. Thus, this only changes the names of the functions. Previously `__mul__` called intersection and `__add__` called union.

<a id='comment:2'></a>I believe that | and + should be aliases for union. That's how it works for sets already

```
sage: Set([1,2,3])+Set([3,4,6])
{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
sage: Set([1,2,3])|Set([3,4,6])
{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
```

And for graphs only + is defined

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph() + graphs.ChvatalGraph()
Petersen graph disjoint_union Chvatal graph: Graph on 22 vertices
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph() | graphs.ChvatalGraph()
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'Graph' and 'Graph'
```

If you agree with that you can add a `__or__ = __add__` after the function's definition `:-)`

I am Ok for `__add__` having the same behavior as `__or__`.

But, do we agree that `__mul__` should not link to `__and__` ? To me, if A and B are two automata, A * B means the concatenation of them, not the intersection.
