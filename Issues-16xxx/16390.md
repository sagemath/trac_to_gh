As explained in https://github.com/robertwb/sage-patchbot/issues/35 and ticket:16377#comment:11, patchbot when started with `sage -patchbot` will clobber your Sage installation because the environment is changed before patchbot is started. 

vbraun: "The handling of the -patchbot switch in src/bin/sage needs to be moved above the "Source sage-env" step, so it is done before the environment is changed."
