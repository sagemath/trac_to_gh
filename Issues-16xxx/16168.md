projective_morphism uses parallel calls in several functions. It uses the multiprocessing.py function parallel_iter. It seems on OSX that there is some issue with the function. For example, calling possible_periods on a function multiple times (usually 50 is sufficient) will result in a error which varies. This does seem appear to occur on linux.

The p_iter_fork function seems more stable and does not have this issue.

While we are adjusting how parallel works, I think a ncpus kwd should also be added.

parallel_iter is still being used in possible_periods.


Switch that to p_iter_fork and add the ncpus kwd.

This looks good to me. I am unable to reproduce the errors I was seeing on OSX after this fix.

I made one minor change, which was to move the import out of the function and to the top of the file.
