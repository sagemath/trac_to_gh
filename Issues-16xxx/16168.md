projective_morphism uses parallel calls in several functions. It uses the multiprocessing.py function parallel_iter. It seems on OSX that there is some issue with the function. For example, calling possible_periods on a function multiple times (usually 50 is sufficient) will result in a error which varies. This does seem appear to occur on linux.

The p_iter_fork function seems more stable and does not have this issue.

While we are adjusting how parallel works, I think a ncpus kwd should also be added.
