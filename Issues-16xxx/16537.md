```
Since Py2.1 there are the //rich comparison// special methods (`__eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__`) to implement comparison operators (`==, !=, <, <=, >, >=` respectively) for custom classes.

This is more flexible (but somewhat more tedious) than defining the special method `__cmp__`.

In Py3 the special method `__cmp__` is ignored. The standard function `cmp()` (which is mostly used to implement `__cmp__` methods) is gone.

One may define a replacement function like

```
def cmp(a, b):
    return (a > b) - (a < b)
```

But this does not improved performance. And it does not seem forward looking ...

Unfortunately `__cmp__` and `cmp()` are used a LOT in Sage. And the migration to rich comparison can not be done purely mechanical :-(

Since Py2.7 there is a class decorator [functools.total_ordering](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html?highlight=total_ordering#functools.total_ordering) to help to create the full set of special method `__lt__, __le__, __gt__, __ge__` when given one of those.


See Lennart Regebro's [Chapter: Use rich comparison operators](http://python3porting.com/preparing.html) for a more detailed discussion.

Useful tool to see the size of the remaining problem:

```
git grep -c "^[^#]*[^a-z\._]cmp(" *.py
git grep -c "^[^#]*[^a-z\._]cmp(" *.pyx
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

## Progress

Several tickets have already been submitted and merged for fixing `__cmp__` -> `__richcmp__` issues in Python 3.  The remaining issues will be tracked here:

### Open

[This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (keywords~=richcmp&status=new))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro)

### In Progress
[This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (keywords~=richcmp&status!=new&status!=closed))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro)

### Modules needing work
The following modules still contain `__cmp__` either in user-visible classes or in tests that may need to be addressed for Python 3.

I did some grepping to get a first impression of the amount of work required:
|                                     |   |
|-------------------------------------|---|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__cmp__" |wc -l` |377|
| | |
|`git grep -P "def\s+__eq__"  |wc -l` |170|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__ne__"  |wc -l` |70|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__lt__"  |wc -l` |29|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__le__"  |wc -l` |18|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__gt__"  |wc -l` |21|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__ge__"  |wc -l` |18|
| | |
|`git grep -P "\bcmp\s*\(" |wc -l` |1042|

The conclusion seems that we have to implement //rich comparison// (i.e. define `__eq__` with `__ne__` and `__gt__` with the class decorator `functools.total_ordering`) for about 350 classes!

And then there are those 1000+ calls to `cmp`.

And unfortunately the changes are mostly not syntactical but they require insight into the code!

Attachment [rich-comparison-python-3.4.0.txt](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket16537/rich-comparison-python-3.4.0.txt) by @wluebbe created at 2014-06-27 16:24:42

Some remarks on the attached files:
* The 1st script shows the effects of varying which of the special methods `__eq__, __ne__, __lt__` and ``@`total_ordering` are defined. The 2nd and 3rd files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 all of ("eq", "ne", "lt", "total") must be used to always obtain correct results.
  * In Py3 it appears that "ne" is implied (be "eq").
  * For correct behavior in Py2 and Py3 all of "eq", "ne", "lt", "total" should be used.
* The 4th script shows the results of the comparison operators when defining no `__cmp_` or using a self defined `cmp` or using the standard library `cmp`. The 5th and 6th files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 "no_cmp" gives often wrong results, but always correct results when `__cmp__` is defined.
  * In Py3 there are always type errors for "lt", "le", "gt"and "ge". For "eq" and "ne" some wrong and some correct.
  * `__cmp__` does not work in Py3! Rich comparison must be implemented!
* The 7th script shows whether it possible to define the rich comparison special methods  using `cmp`. The 8nd and 9th files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 it is possible.
  * In Py3 one needs a user defined `cmp` function that is based on `<` and `>`.
  * Both in Py2 and Py3 ``@`total_ordering` is required.

I suspect that `sage.structure.element.Element` is a better location for it, since `SageObject` doesn't have any comparison infrastructure, and `Element` has.

In any case, the quoted code cannot be used verbatim, since these classes are cdef cython, where the interface is via the `__richcmp__` special method, not the various `__eq__` etc. 

Element already has a `__richcmp__`, as well as a `__cmp__`. Precedence rules for comparison lookup in Python 2 imply that `__cmp__` should never be triggered. The implementation there in some branches will try to look up `__cmp__`. This would be a good place to start looking into how much we really depend on `__cmp__`.

Currently, a Sage `Element` already implements rich comparison using `__cmp__`/`_cmp_`/`_cmp_c_impl` (for simplification of this, see #17890). In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with keeping that behaviour even in Python 3.

My conclusion from this is that the problem really is `cmp()` and not `__cmp__`.

Why does this problem not appear for every (new-style) class then? The base class `object` already has those slots:

```
>>> object.__lt__
<method-wrapper '__lt__' of type object at 0x7fe14ebdf0e0>

That's exactly the problem.  The way `total_ordering` implemented it does something like:

```
for op in ['__lt__', '__gt__', ...]:
    if getattr(cls, op, None) is not getattr(object, op, None):
        # Do something...
```

So if there is a built-in base class that is not `object` it fails, even if it's still wrapping the standard implementation of that slot.  I would consider this a bug in Python--it shouldn't be doing identity comparison on the slot wrapper object itself.

As I said, I was wrong: `object` does not implement rich comparison:

```
>>> a = object()
>>> a.__lt__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute '__lt__'
```
So rich comparison obviously cannot be inherited from `object`.

Right!

```
Python 3.4.1 (default, Sep  4 2015, 12:50:14) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = object()
>>> a.__lt__
<method-wrapper '__lt__' of object object at 0x7f4ccf850070>
```

On Python 2, `object` has neither `__cmp__` nor `__eq__`.

I'm still working on organizing some of these things.  Instead of putting notes in the "ticket" column please just put notes in the module column (or a separate column--perhaps I'll do that).

Even "deprecated" modules still need a ticket related to removing them if it's deprecated.
