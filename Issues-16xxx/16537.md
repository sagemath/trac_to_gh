```
Since Py2.1 there are the *rich comparison* special methods (<code>__eq__, \`__ne__\`, \`__lt__\`, \`__le__\`, \`__gt__\`, __ge__</code>) to implement comparison operators (`==, !=, <, <=, >, >=` respectively) for custom classes.

This is more flexible (but somewhat more tedious) than defining the special method `__cmp__`.

In Py3 the special method `__cmp__` is ignored. The standard function `cmp()` (which is mostly used to implement `__cmp__` methods) is gone.

One may define a replacement function like

```
def cmp(a, b):
    return (a > b) - (a < b)
```

But this does not improved performance. And it does not seem forward looking ...

Unfortunately `__cmp__` and `cmp()` are used a LOT in Sage. And the migration to rich comparison can not be done purely mechanical :-(

Since Py2.7 there is a class decorator [functools.total_ordering](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html?highlight=total_ordering#functools.total_ordering) to help to create the full set of special method <code>__lt__, \`__le__\`, \`__gt__\`, __ge__</code> when given one of those.


See Lennart Regebro's [Chapter: Use rich comparison operators](http://python3porting.com/preparing.html) for a more detailed discussion.

Useful tool to see the size of the remaining problem:

```
git grep -c "^[^#]*[^a-z\._]cmp(" *.py
git grep -c "^[^#]*[^a-z\._]cmp(" *.pyx
```

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

## Progress

Several tickets have already been submitted and merged for fixing `__cmp__` -> `__richcmp__` issues in Python 3.  The remaining issues will be tracked here:

### Open

[This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (keywords~=richcmp&status=new))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro)

### In Progress
[This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (keywords~=richcmp&status!=new&status!=closed))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro)

### Modules needing work
The following modules still contain `__cmp__` either in user-visible classes or in tests that may need to be addressed for Python 3.

I did some grepping to get a first impression of the amount of work required:
|                                     |   |
|-------------------------------------|---|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__cmp__" |wc -l` |377|
| | |
|`git grep -P "def\s+__eq__"  |wc -l` |170|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__ne__"  |wc -l` |70|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__lt__"  |wc -l` |29|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__le__"  |wc -l` |18|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__gt__"  |wc -l` |21|
|`git grep -P "def\s+__ge__"  |wc -l` |18|
| | |
|`git grep -P "\bcmp\s*\(" |wc -l` |1042|

The conclusion seems that we have to implement *rich comparison* (i.e. define `__eq__` with `__ne__` and `__gt__` with the class decorator `functools.total_ordering`) for about 350 classes!

And then there are those 1000+ calls to `cmp`.

And unfortunately the changes are mostly not syntactical but they require insight into the code!

**Attachment:** [rich-comparison-python-3.4.0.txt](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket16537/rich-comparison-python-3.4.0.txt)

Some remarks on the attached files:
* The 1st script shows the effects of varying which of the special methods <code>__eq__, \`__ne__\`, __lt__</code> and `@total_ordering` are defined. The 2nd and 3rd files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 all of ("eq", "ne", "lt", "total") must be used to always obtain correct results.
  * In Py3 it appears that "ne" is implied (be "eq").
  * For correct behavior in Py2 and Py3 all of "eq", "ne", "lt", "total" should be used.
* The 4th script shows the results of the comparison operators when defining no `__cmp_` or using a self defined `cmp` or using the standard library `cmp`. The 5th and 6th files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 "no_cmp" gives often wrong results, but always correct results when `__cmp__` is defined.
  * In Py3 there are always type errors for "lt", "le", "gt"and "ge". For "eq" and "ne" some wrong and some correct.
  * `__cmp__` does not work in Py3! Rich comparison must be implemented!
* The 7th script shows whether it possible to define the rich comparison special methods  using `cmp`. The 8nd and 9th files show the results for Py2 and Py3 respectively.
  * In Py2 it is possible.
  * In Py3 one needs a user defined `cmp` function that is based on `<` and `>`.
  * Both in Py2 and Py3 `@total_ordering` is required.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A5):

I suspect that `sage.structure.element.Element` is a better location for it, since `SageObject` doesn't have any comparison infrastructure, and `Element` has.

In any case, the quoted code cannot be used verbatim, since these classes are cdef cython, where the interface is via the `__richcmp__` special method, not the various `__eq__` etc. 

Element already has a `__richcmp__`, as well as a `__cmp__`. Precedence rules for comparison lookup in Python 2 imply that `__cmp__` should never be triggered. The implementation there in some branches will try to look up `__cmp__`. This would be a good place to start looking into how much we really depend on `__cmp__`.

Currently, a Sage `Element` already implements rich comparison using `__cmp__`/`_cmp_`/`_cmp_c_impl` (for simplification of this, see #17890). In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with keeping that behaviour even in Python 3.

My conclusion from this is that the problem really is `cmp()` and not `__cmp__`.

It looks like even if just implementing `__eq__`, CPython adds its own slots for all the comparison operators that override any defined in the base classes.  So that's kind of annoying.

To be clear (and part of the problem) is that there's only *one* rich comparison slot (`tp_richcompare`).  So if even one rich comparison operator is overloaded in a `cdef class` (say, `__eq__`), then all the rich comparison methods get new slot wrappers rather than inheriting them from `object`, even though the implementations for those operators are still the defaults.

As I said, I was wrong: `object` does not implement rich comparison:

```
>>> a = object()
>>> a.__lt__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute '__lt__'
```
So rich comparison obviously cannot be inherited from `object`.

Right!

```
Python 3.4.1 (default, Sep  4 2015, 12:50:14) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = object()
>>> a.__lt__
<method-wrapper '__lt__' of object object at 0x7f4ccf850070>
```

On Python 2, `object` has neither `__cmp__` nor `__eq__`.

I'm still working on organizing some of these things.  Instead of putting notes in the "ticket" column please just put notes in the module column (or a separate column--perhaps I'll do that).

Even "deprecated" modules still need a ticket related to removing them if it's deprecated.
