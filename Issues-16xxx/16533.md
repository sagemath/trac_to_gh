The following example, taken from the documentation of the animate module, produces no visible output in the notebook:

```
sage: sines = [plot(c*sin(x), (-2*pi,2*pi), color=Color(c,0,0), ymin=-1,ymax=1) for c in sxrange(0,1,.2)]
sage: a = animate(sines)
sage: a.show()
```

OK, I did a bit more than just enabling the embedding. I did restructure the show and save commands, and added support for [APNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG). I hope that I might be able to add other formats in the future, in the spirit of ticket:7298.

Personally, I completely disagree with this. I think fixing the notebook animate bug, the `<video>` tag and the APNG support should be 3 different tickets.

But there are several parts where I would not know where to put them.\n\n* Several documentation improvements are not directly related to either of these issues. Should I file yet another ticket?\n* And this whole modification of having `show` call `save` is used for APNG and <video>, so where should it go?

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:8):
> I think fixing the notebook animate bug, the `<video>` tag and the APNG support should be 3 different tickets.

I guess I could try to split my modifications up. But there are several parts where I would not know where to put them.

* Several documentation improvements are not directly related to either of these issues. Should I file yet another ticket?
* And this whole modification of having `show` call `save` is used for APNG and <video>, so where should it go? Can I create a branch which contains this change, and then use that branch for both APNG and <video>?
* The last commit, about inlining animations in tables, is again distinct, even though it was included in the ticket:7298 patch as well. Separate ticket as well?

The way I see it at the moment, we have 5 distinct modifications, two of which share a commit:

* Notebook:
  * [Create HTML to embed generated GIF in notebook](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/9374cff6d1dbc7ca44749c36a1e5b4693e81819b)
  * [Return path to generated file](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/84886ce6d5d46ee4940f12e7ea508e885ba17ebb)
  * [Avoid leaking animation files](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8199b0237d6e5053932bd609ea941a02f993b36d)
* Common APNG and <video>:
  * [Base Animation.show on Animation.save, and pass more arguments](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1d29d17be571d24af57c85aedb2c31e9e5a1277f)
* APNG support:
  * [Add APNG support](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/1f7de6eb7fa8bffdf54e1a73d6c8a0ae4051ffd1)
  * [Avoid multiple acTL hunks in APNG file](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/f3a5b9010cf47bcca463360a2e10e6241c7628be)
  * [Turn generator into list when rendering frames](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/4c9a4910ad273dcb0f6226ef00274267f0192602)
  * [Fix doc test](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/57254600199330cece33a867355183730c611218)
* Documentation improvements:
  * [Improved documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/0c21bd8d4257cb8c96560880a84e827552324378)
* <video> tag support:
  * [Support HTML5 video tag](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/3edfb7f99fc79edf4716eb2e80f927213b9f86cb)
  * [More control over video tag attributes](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/b8a3c7c3affeffea7d3054e69f18065204c5d930)
* Tables:
  * [Inline animations in tables](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/51007fbf59595127ed4b784155e91d78ebb52b2a)

It would take some time to work out whether these branches each make sense on their own. I'd prefer to only invest that effort if I know it is actually needed. Would you be willing to review some of these aspects, Jeroen? If so, that would be one reason for formatting things in the way you prefer.

Ok; I worked on #12827, and I confess I didn't think to check functionality in the notebook.  The following is indeed broken, but I don't know why (I haven't read this ticket yet):

```
c = animate([circle((i,i), 1-1/(i+1), hue=i/10) for i in srange(0,2,0.2)],xmin=0,ymin=0,xmax=2,ymax=2,figsize=[2,2])
c.show()
```

Moreover, when I do

```
c.save()
```

I get nothing, but when I do 

```
c.save('tmp.gif')
```

the gif is saved and is displayed.  I'll investigate further . . .

This is essentially undoing the `graphics_filename` removal from #12827. Although I would advise against unconditionally using `graphics_filename`. I did that at some point, and suddenly my test suite started bleeding files into the current working directory from where I ran the tests. That's why I wrote [8199b02](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8199b0237d6e5053932bd609ea941a02f993b36d) in my now-superseded branch.

The reason to have all this infrastructure is twofold. On the one hand, it also facilitates later improvements, like #7298 and #16571. On the other hand, it makes code more similar to `Graphics.show`, which helps maintainability. So I really suggest you compare `Animation.show` to [Graphics.show](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/plot/graphics.py#n1785) when reviewing this. There you see common aspects:

* Delegating to save
* Passing kwargs
* Using `graphics_filename` only in the embedded case

I think this commonness justifies the larger footprint of my modification, but if you want to aim for a fix which is as small as possible, then concentrating on the `tmp_filename` vs. `graphics_filename` distinction is sufficient.

The former saves in a temporary directory which the notebook knows nothing about, whereas the latter saves in the current directory where the notebook will find the file and display it to the user. Also note #16573 about this “I get nothing” user experience.

I'm cc-ing jhpalmieri since he gave positive review to the ticket which introduced this regression -- #12827.

If I understand correctly, the minimal necessary change is to use `graphics_filename` in embedded mode of animate.  I've just pushed a branch which does this, and the code from the ticket description does show an animation in the notebook.

Branch: [u/niles/ticket/16533-stopgap](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/compare/u/niles/ticket/16533-stopgap...develop)


I think the other changes discussed here are important, but I don't have time right now to understand them fully or review them.

Now that I've actually looked at the plot code and the [@options decorator](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/misc/sage/misc/decorators.html#sage.misc.decorators.options), I think it was designed to solve a slightly different problem (set global option defaults) but does give a way to set default keywords once and have them appear in the docstring of multiple functions.

I'll have to investigate all the magic asociated with `_sage_argspec_`, but now that you mention it, it *should* be possible to improve the situation here as well. In particular, the `@options` decorator would be useful for `show` in any case, since people might have preferences over how to view their animations, particularly with respect to format (GIF / APNG / WebM / Theora). Having to set these in every call can become annoying. Will investigate that.

I guess I should close this ticket here, since various derived tickets will take care of the distinct aspects. Since I can't do so now, I'll check whether I can after accepting it first.

#16608 and #16645 are the most immediate fix to the problem described in the ticket description. Here is a list of related tickets:

* Fix `show`: #16608
* Fix `gif` and `ffmpeg`: #16645 based on #15515
* File names in 3d plotting: #16640
* `<video>` and tables: #7298
* Documentation and doctest example: #16570
* APNG support: #16571
* A way to deprecate positional parameters: #16607

At the moment, there is no commit in any of these to tweak `_sage_argspec_` for `Animation.show()`. I guess I might eventually write a wrapper for that, something like `@delegates_to` which would copy the names of parameters from other commands. But I'm not certain that this would indeed be a good idea, so I guess it should be discussed first, perhaps on the mailing list. With so many patches awaiting review at the moment, I don't feel like implementing yet another feature just now.

Thanks for the clarification. I guess I thought of “review” mostly in terms of “code review” and therefore didn't apply it to situations where there is no code to review.
