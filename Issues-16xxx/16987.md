Needs some rebase.

Couldn't you split this in two tickets?
1. new spkg with interface
2. new features to schemes
Would be easier to review.

Maybe we could open a ticket for the integration of Chow ? After contacting the authors, of course.
I think I had a preliminary contact with Sorger before he got his current important official duties.
