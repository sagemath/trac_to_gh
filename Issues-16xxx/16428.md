It had something to do with cython compiled stuff.

I'm not really found of moving everything to a "decl" subdir though I'm aware of the fmpz_poly files issue.
I would slightly find it better to move the "Fmpz_poly" class stuff somewhere else and keep the real FLINT C/Cython glue directly in "sage/libs/flint", but I won't fight for such a solution or another one though.

Would you prefer to move the `Fmpz_poly` class and the `fmpz_poly()` declarations in the same `.pxd` file?

I see some `mpz_...` functions defined in Sage files have been deleted.
I guess it's because FLINT now provides similar functionalities, or at least the functions using them in Sage have changed to use other flitn functions?

The array things are in the wrong places in the definition of the `nmod...` types in `types.pxd`. Apart from that it looks ok.

Could you correct that in a new commit (that is not doing a forced push).
I'm currently testing the branch in a personal branch using more stuff from flint and merging forced push can be a pain sometimes.

I'll restest everything on top of a vanilla `trac/develop` branch a little later.
