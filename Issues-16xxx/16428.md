I'm not really found of moving everything to a "decl" subdir though I'm aware of the fmpz_poly files issue.
I would slightly find it better to move the "Fmpz_poly" class stuff somewhere else and keep the real FLINT C/Cython glue directly in "sage/libs/flint", but I won't fight for such a solution or another one though.

Would you prefer to move the `Fmpz_poly` class and the `fmpz_poly()` declarations in the same `.pxd` file?

The array things are in the wrong places in the definition of the `nmod...` types in `types.pxd`. Apart from that it looks ok.

Could you correct that in a new commit (that is not doing a forced push).
I'm currently testing the branch in a personal branch using more stuff from flint and merging forced push can be a pain sometimes.

I'll restest everything on top of a vanilla `trac/develop` branch a little later.
