<a id='comment:25'></a>I'm not really found of moving everything to a "decl" subdir though I'm aware of the fmpz_poly files issue.
I would slightly find it better to move the "Fmpz_poly" class stuff somewhere else and keep the real FLINT C/Cython glue directly in "sage/libs/flint", but I won't fight for such a solution or another one though.

Would you prefer to move the `Fmpz_poly` class and the `fmpz_poly()` declarations in the same `.pxd` file?
