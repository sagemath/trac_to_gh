True

is_chain should return False in this case

Generally, I don't see a reason to keep to stable versions of Sage. Modules enter the Sage codebase with lots of bugs usually, which are then fixed step by step, with very few regressions coming in. As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing more beta about the beta versions than about the "stables".
