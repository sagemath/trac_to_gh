Exceptions can look different. For example:

**Python 2**:

```
>>> sys.version
'2.7.5+ (default, Feb 27 2014, 19:37:08) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
>>> 
```

**Python 3**:

```
>>> sys.version
'3.3.2+ (default, Feb 28 2014, 00:52:16) \n[GCC 4.8.1]'
>>> 1/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>> 
```
