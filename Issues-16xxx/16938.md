When building sage with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, then it turns out that the debug and the cygwin64 patches to the Singular spkg are in conflict. Hence, the build fails. Let's fix it!

I suppose the fix will eventually be in a stable upstream release.

There is also an issue with the new m4ri: [https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri/issue/59/assertion-sizeof-mzd_t-64-fails-on-32-bit](https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri/issue/59/assertion-sizeof-mzd_t-64-fails-on-32-bit)

<a id='comment:1'></a>The function `choose_patches()` of singular's spkg-install removes most of the files in `$SRC/omalloc/` if we are in debug mode. However, the cygwin64 patch tries to patch some files in that folder.

In addition to that, the cygwin64 patch says

```
+ifeq ($(SINGUNAME),x86_64-Win)
+SO_SUFFIX = dll
+MODULE_SUFFIX    = dll
+LIBSINGULAR_FLAGS = -shared
+LIBSINGULAR_LIBS = -lsingfac -lsingcf -lntl -lreadline -lgmp -lomalloc 
+endif
+
```
So, if one would try to build the debug version in 64 bit cygwin, then one had -lomalloc, but that would not work, since omalloc is disabled on purpose, for the debug version.

What to do? In principle, we could put an alternative version of the cygwin64 patch into the patches/conditional folder, and if we are in debug version, we could let `choose_patches()` replace the regular cygwin patch version by the conditional version.

I will try to solve the problem accordingly, however, I have no windows box. Hence, someone else needs to test if a debug version of singular works in cygwin.

Cygwin itself is not in the game. Only the cygwin PATCH currently constitutes a problem. It is not a big deal to solve it: I modified the patches *and* spkg-install so that building the debug version starts (i.e., so that all patches and changes apply).

Meanwhile Hans gave me a hint on where to get a missing function. After fixing that, the debug version will hopefully build.

The name `tesths.cc` suggests that this is for testing. So, did you build with `SAGE_CHECK` and `SAGE_DEBUG` together?

<a id='comment:41'></a>Hi Volker, I am not happy with the two commits to reduce size of doctests.

It is said in the doc that `below we do the Fateman benchmark over the finite field of order 32003`, but I guess with your changes the statement becomes wrong, it isn't the Fateman benchmark if the exponent is only 10 and not 20.

Also I don't see why a test that is marked "long" anyway should be removed just because the debug version slows it down too much.

By the way, how long does this test take in non-debug version? It is stated that it used to take 12 seconds, four years ago. And 12 seconds is totally fine for a long test, IMHO.

I'd rather have c): A buildbot with `SAGE_DEBUG` that only runs the tests that are not marked long.

Yes, but I have always seen a failure to report what has failed.

But here, there is simply nothing in the log. It simply says that some tests failed, but not WHICH test failed, not what was the expected output and the actual output, not whether there has been a crash. Absolutely nothing.

Not before Monday (bandwidth).

Anyway, the verbose output above indicates that we have numerical noise, not related with Singular. By the way, if that's relevant: In my local branch I have merged your gdb branch from #16978.

Looks like a genuine bug to me in libm4ri. I don't know why they need `sizeof(mzd_t) == 64`, but that equality is only true on 64-bit systems. Since two of the fields in `mzd_t` are pointers, this would give only 56 bytes on 32-bit systems.

No idea. And I actually doubt that M4RI is to blame. After all, the error occurs in the line

```

That's just the top of the traceback. Importing `sage.all` does a lot of things. The full traceback clearly shows that the problem is in m4ri:

Not really. You built a broken version of m4ri before and that broken version will not automatically be updated when doing "make". However, as long as you don't first build a broken version with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` without applying this patch, there is no problem.

One could argue that there is a problem with dependency checking in the sense that `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` does not automatically cause everything to get rebuilt. But that's really a different issue.

OK, but I think that dependency checking should work, regardless whether it is a debug or a non-debug built.

Anyway, meanwhile I got loads of other errors. I will next try `make distclean` and `make`, with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and unsetting `SAGE_UPGRADING`.

Dependency checking works (modulo #17072).

The problem is that building with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` didn't work before, but the problem with `m4ri` wasn't seen at build-time of `m4ri`. Therefore, the build system thinks that the build of `m4ri` was successful, even though it was completely broken.

Perhaps the hardware is 64-bit, but the kernel in the logs you posted is 32-bit.

`uname -m` prints the "machine hardware name" which is probably what you want.
