The interface with Mathematica has been broken since Mathematica 9 came out. 
The problem is that the program `math` does not behave nicely with expect. 
This fix uses a wrapper, as suggested in [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/), to make `math` readline-aware.

<a id='comment:8'></a>It seems to me that until the interface is designed properly, it will always have these issues. What is probably the most sensible approach is to use the C interface to Mathematica's published API, called MathLink

http://www.wolfram.com/learningcenter/tutorialcollection/MathLinkDevelopmentInC/

like "jmath" uses

http://robotics.caltech.edu/~radford/jmath/

See the 

The total source code for that is under 1000 lines, and makes use of functions like MLInitialize, MLActivate etc. 

Sure it will take a bit more time to get it right, but it seems to me a better long-term approach.

no, that wrapper (original or updated) does not check whether `math` can be called.
And it uses obsolete `os.popen` stuff, too...

I don't think`rlfe` is part of Sage currently, and it's not installed by default on Ubuntu or OS X.  While there are many tools available that do the work of the current wrapper, it does have the advantage of being a tiny script with no dependencies other than Python itself.
