The interface with Mathematica has been broken since Mathematica 9 came out. 
The problem is that the program `math` does not behave nicely with expect. 
This fix uses a wrapper, as suggested in [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/363500-mathematica-with-a-gnu-readline-input/), to make `math` readline-aware.

It seems to me that until the interface is designed properly, it will always have these issues. What is probably the most sensible approach is to use the C interface to Mathematica's published API, called MathLink

http://www.wolfram.com/learningcenter/tutorialcollection/MathLinkDevelopmentInC/

like "jmath" uses

http://robotics.caltech.edu/~radford/jmath/

See the 

The total source code for that is under 1000 lines, and makes use of functions like MLInitialize, MLActivate etc. 

Sure it will take a bit more time to get it right, but it seems to me a better long-term approach.

I agree that this is not a good solution: at the time I needed something quick and this was the fastest way I could get it to work. In the long term using MathLink is a better idea but I am not sure there is interest enough in this feature to justify the effort.

Robert Jacobson indicated he wanted to do this last month

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/Mathematica$20interface|sort:relevance/sage-devel/N4K6lUkUwe0/pKlGj4AfdDcJ

I was the only one to make any comments. Perhaps he might want to complete what he started.

I tried out this patch with Mathematica 8, 9, and 10.  It worked fine with all of them, so moving to positive review.  A more robust interface would of course be better, but at least this will mean that the Mathematica interface isn't broken "out of the box" as it has been for several years now...

no, that wrapper (original or updated) does not check whether `math` can be called.
And it uses obsolete `os.popen` stuff, too...

I did a little research and it looks like this wrapper is duplicated effort and we should get rid of it. We should be able to call `math` via `rlfe`, which is part of the standard GNU readline implementation, simply as

```
rfle math
```

Alternatively there are plenty more, maybe too fancy for our purpose, wrappers like `rlwrap`.
