The Py2 function `raw_input()` is called `input()` in Py3. 


The Py2 `input()` function (which implicitly evaluates the input) is gone.

The tool 2to3 renames `raw_input` to `input`. 


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 3 effected (usage of `raw_input()`) modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Instead of 

```
+import six
...
...
-            line = raw_input()
+            line = six.moves.input()
```
I would prefer

```
+from six.moves import input
...
...
-            line = raw_input()
+            line = input()
```
The reasoning is
* I see the goal as not only to enable Sage for Python 2 AND 3 but by writing **clean Python 3 code that is backwards compatible with Python 2**.
* Usage of compatibility libraries like `six` (or `future`) should appear (if possible) only at the top of a module. The rest of the module should have only pure Python 3 code. 
* This will ease the cleaning of the code when somewhere in the (far) future Python 2 support will be dropped.
* We will have to explain in the documentation how the write Python 3 code in Sage while maintaining compatibility with Python 2. And it would by very helpful to have automated checks ...
By the way all tests pass :-)

would override Python2's `input()` which behaves different, as written in the ticket description. That's why I went the other way.

Cleaning is easy, too: `s/six.moves.//g`

I did not find any uses of Python 2 `input()` in Sage, so there is no name conflict.
This old `input()` has been removed from Python 3 as it is not secure because `eval()` is called implicitly on an unchecked string.

is valid and important.

But this change effects only 3 modules, the code is fine and it tests OK.

But we should discuss on sage-devel how to approach the other and bigger tickets of stage 2 (usage of migration tools, which compatibility library, ...). I will try to initiate such a wider discussion of the Sage Py2/3 migration strategy. We will advance faster when there are more collaborators and ideas. A common understanding and strategy  could prevent wasted efforts.
