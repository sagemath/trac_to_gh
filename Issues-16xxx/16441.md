Quite a while ago I submitted a bug report to the Pari mailing list that affects computations in number fields (bnfcertify is affected) and results in an infinite loop. This has been fixed.

However, it seems that sage is still using one of the affected versions of pari (2.5.5 is affected).

Please upgrade Pari!
