Right now, we can not interrupt `MOLS_table`... this is a consequence of the intensive cythonization.

We need more `sig_on()`, `sig_off()`.

Yo !

Seems to do the job, thanks !

```
-        return orthogonal_array(k,n,existence=True)
+        ans = orthogonal_array(k,n,existence=True)
+        return ans
```

Is `return orthogonal_array(k,n,existence=True)` declared politically incorrect now ? `:-P`

Nathann

P.S. : the commit's ticket contains the wrong number but we probably won't base anything on this branch so it is not a problem.

The messages in the ticket description

```
^CException KeyboardInterrupt: KeyboardInterrupt() in 'sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays_find_recursive.is_available' ignored
```
show that the issue is not just `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` but also missing `except` clauses in `cdef` functions, see also #16233 for how to fix this.

Also, your codes mixes Cython and Python, so I would go with [sig_check()](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_in_cython.html#using-sig-check) in the inner loops which is much safer than `sig_on()` and `sig_off()`.

Thanks, I am carefully reading it!

By the way, I got something very strange here. `find_recursive_construction` is a cached function (with the decorator in `sage.misc.cachefunc`). It appears that after some of the interruption, the `CachedFunction` class suddenly decided that the function now takes 3 arguments instead of 2... and trying to call it with 3 values instead of 2 I just got an unhandled  SIGSEGV.

Might be something subtle going on with exception and cache but I do not know why. I can describe the case in more details.

The exception is propagated with the return value `-1`, I think it is cleaner to make it an int.

Anyway, the choice `int/bint` is just a compiler instruction for Cython. There is no gain of having it a `bint` type here since it is always used in C code. The purpose of the bint type is to mix well Python booleans with C ints. One difference (that I learn few seconds ago) is in

```
def f(b):
   int x = b
   bint y = b
```
The first conversion will involves `b.__int__` while the second `b.__nonzero__`.

Oh right, right.

Of course, but there if there is no reason to change that into an 'int' it was better to keep it. And that's a good reason to change it. Good to go !
