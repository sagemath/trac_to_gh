```
Here we actually use the system-wide `pkg-config` if present to query both Sage's as well as the system's package-config (`*.pc`) files.

If only Sage's `pkgconf` is available, `.pc` files (and hence the packages they belong to) installed outside of Sage still won't be seen by Sage's `pkg-config` wrapper script.

It is therefore still recommended to have a system-wide `pkg-config`, despite Sage now having its own, e.g. to let R use graphics packages Sage doesn't ship.

One issue still is that we have to call the system-wide `pkg-config` (if present) in `spkg-install`; I'd suggest to modify `sage-env` to save the original `PATH` in `SAGE_ORIG_PATH`, say.

(Otherwise we'd presumably at least accumulate folders upon reinstallation of Sage's `pkgconf`.)

Or we could first try to delete Sage's symlink from `pkg-config` to `pkgconf`.

Have you read Volker's patch? One of the first thing he does is removing any pkg-config already installed in sage. 
Since we are interested in hardcoded path in the application doing 

```
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="" pkg-config .....
```
would work.

Well, "the" `pkg-config` if present.

One small problem:

While older versions of `pkg-config` (such as 0.15.0) exit with a *non-zero* status when called with

```sh
pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
```
some "newer" versions (still not supporting `pc_path`, such as 0.22) return 0 (and print a blank line).

So we cannot just check the exit code.

Hmmm, that way broken `pkg-config` installations (seen on Darwin) aren't (or can't be) cured.

Anyway, why `/bin/sh`?

You'd have to change the error message (in case `m4` failed) accordingly.

Hmmm, the only difference I see on a MacOS X system without a system-wide `pkg-config` is:

```
92c92
< checking for pkg-config... no
---
> checking for pkg-config... /Users/leif/Sage/sage-6.2.beta7/local/bin/pkg-config
497c497,498
< configure: not checking for cairo as pkg-config is not present
---
> checking whether pkg-config knows about cairo and pango... no
> checking whether pkg-config knows about cairo... no
```

So apparently R does rely on `pkg-config`, and *doesn't* try to find libraries / packages by other means if there's no `pkg-config` at all.

Still, it would be best to tell `pkgconf` also which *system folders* to search (in case there's no system-wide `pkg-config`), but that's even more kind of reinventing the wheel; the by far easiest (and IMHO most straight-forward) solution is to just make `pkg-config` a Sage prerequisite.  (IIRC there are pre-built binaries available for MacOS X as well; Linux and SunOS aren't a problem either.)

Sure, but we should recommend to install a system-wide version, and probably document `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` even for those who don't have one.  (But that IMHO doesn't have to happen here and now.)

Hmmm, for whatever reason (shell caching I presume), I end up in an infinite loop.

Although `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config` gets deleted right before `m4` is called, `command -v pkg-config` apparently still gives `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config`, such that the script finally calls itself...

FWIW,

```sh
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.1.5(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
```

(I've run into similar a couple of times; the shell doesn't "see" freshly installed programs immediately.)

So it'd probably be better to call `PATH="$SAGE_ORIG_PATH" command -v pkg-config` (modifying `sage-env` accordingly, i.e., saving the original `PATH`).

I have no idea what's going on here; with

```sh
# pkgconf is an alternative to the "official" pkg-config, and does not
# automatically install a "pkg-config" binary, so we used to install
# a symbolic link (now replaced by a wrapper script).
rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"   # delete old version (script or symlink)

echo M4, shell\:
m4 <<"EOF"
translit(esyscmd(`command -v pkg-config'),`')
EOF
echo M4, bash\:
m4 <<"EOF"
translit(esyscmd(`bash -c "command -v pkg-config"'),`')
EOF

# Generate a wrapper script which either calls Sage's 'pkgconf' or a system-
# wide 'pkg-config' if present (hardcoding its location at creation time):
m4 ../patches/pkg-config.in > "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error creating the pkg-config script."
    exit 1
fi

echo Generated script:
echo =================
cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
echo =================

chmod 755 "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
```
(and without `bash -c ...` in `pkg-config.in`), I'm always getting:

```

I still don't get what goes wrong or who's to blame otherwise.




Varying indentation of found vs. ignored `.pc` files is presumably not intentional... ;-)

[still testing...]

Is it intentional that the test suite fails if no system-wide `pkg-config` is installed?

(I mean, of course it should "fail", but shouldn't we skip the test in that case?)

Imagine having set `SAGE_CHECK=yes`...  (while having `sage -f -c pkgconf` fail would probably be ok)

Although I don't like the approach taken; works as advertised, i.e., fixes the regression introduced by #15742.

> I still don't get what goes wrong or who's to blame otherwise.

Apparently some GNUish non-POSIX interpretation of how `command -v` is supposed to work.

Under "normal"(?) circumstances, bash (even when invoked as `/bin/sh`) returns the path of **any existing** (not necessarily executable or even readable) file "foo" found along `PATH` as the result of `command -v foo`.

In contrast, `bash --posix -c "command -v foo"` acts as expected.




That still doesn't explain why <code>esyscmd(\`bash -c "command -v pkg-config"')</code> worked for me (without using a temporary file), whereas <code>esyscmd(\`command -v pkg-config')</code> did not.

Digging through `strace`s, the former calls both `stat()` and `access()`, while the latter only calls `stat()` and seems to be happy with that.
