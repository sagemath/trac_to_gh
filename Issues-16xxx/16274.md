Here we actually use the system-wide `pkg-config` if present to query both Sage's as well as the system's package-config (`*.pc`) files.

If only Sage's `pkgconf` is available, `.pc` files (and hence the packages they belong to) installed outside of Sage still won't be seen by Sage's `pkg-config` wrapper script.

It is therefore still recommended to have a system-wide `pkg-config`, despite Sage now having its own, e.g. to let R use graphics packages Sage doesn't ship.


Keywords: R cairo pango X11 graphics pkg-config

Well, as mentioned on sage-devel,

```sh
pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
```
doesn't work with all versions.

I'd also try to grep the output of `pkg-config --debug` for `Scanning ...`.

Of course after saying that I realised that in Gentoo I can switch to the BSD one if I want (but freedesktop is the default). I would imagine debian would be similar, freedesktop is the default but you have an alternative.

Then again anyone savvy enough to use an alternative should be able to deal with the fall out.

One issue still is that we have to call the system-wide `pkg-config` (if present) in `spkg-install`; I'd suggest to modify `sage-env` to save the original `PATH` in `SAGE_ORIG_PATH`, say.

(Otherwise we'd presumably at least accumulate folders upon reinstallation of Sage's `pkgconf`.)

Or we could first try to delete Sage's symlink from `pkg-config` to `pkgconf`.

Have you read Volker's patch? One of the first thing he does is removing any pkg-config already installed in sage. 
Since we are interested in hardcoded path in the application doing 

```
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="" pkg-config .....
```
would work.

Yes, a while ago though... m)

Well, "the" `pkg-config` if present.

Yep.  Or go with `(unset PKG_CONFIG_PATH; ...)`.

FWIW, here's the `--debug` version with just `sed` (one line per folder):

```sh
$ pkg-config --debug 2>&1 | sed -n '/^Scanning /s/.*'\''\([^'\'']*\)'\''/\1/p'
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
/usr/lib/pkgconfig
/usr/share/pkgconfig

One small problem:

While older versions of `pkg-config` (such as 0.15.0) exit with a *non-zero* status when called with

```sh
pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
```
some "newer" versions (still not supporting `pc_path`, such as 0.22) return 0 (and print a blank line).

So we cannot just check the exit code.

Hmmm, that way broken `pkg-config` installations (seen on Darwin) aren't (or can't be) cured.

Anyway, why `/bin/sh`?

s/`"pkg-config" binary`/`"pkg-config" script`/

You'd have to change the error message (in case `m4` failed) accordingly.

Hmmm, the only difference I see on a MacOS X system without a system-wide `pkg-config` is:

```
92c92
< checking for pkg-config... no
---
> checking for pkg-config... /Users/leif/Sage/sage-6.2.beta7/local/bin/pkg-config
497c497,498
< configure: not checking for cairo as pkg-config is not present
---
> checking whether pkg-config knows about cairo and pango... no
> checking whether pkg-config knows about cairo... no
```

So apparently R does rely on `pkg-config`, and *doesn't* try to find libraries / packages by other means if there's no `pkg-config` at all.

Still, it would be best to tell `pkgconf` also which *system folders* to search (in case there's no system-wide `pkg-config`), but that's even more kind of reinventing the wheel; the by far easiest (and IMHO most straight-forward) solution is to just make `pkg-config` a Sage prerequisite.  (IIRC there are pre-built binaries available for MacOS X as well; Linux and SunOS aren't a problem either.)

Sure, but we should recommend to install a system-wide version, and probably document `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` even for those who don't have one.  (But that IMHO doesn't have to happen here and now.)

Hmmm, for whatever reason (shell caching I presume), I end up in an infinite loop.

Although `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config` gets deleted right before `m4` is called, `command -v pkg-config` apparently still gives `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config`, such that the script finally calls itself...

FWIW,

```sh
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.1.5(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
```

(I've run into similar a couple of times; the shell doesn't "see" freshly installed programs immediately.)

So it'd probably be better to call `PATH="$SAGE_ORIG_PATH" command -v pkg-config` (modifying `sage-env` accordingly, i.e., saving the original `PATH`).

Ah, yes:

```
       If  the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no
       slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for  a  directory  con‐
       taining  an  executable  file  by that name.  Bash uses a hash table to

       performed only if the command is not found in the hash table. [...]
```
(And subshells inherit the cache.)

I have no idea what's going on here; with

```sh
# pkgconf is an alternative to the "official" pkg-config, and does not
# automatically install a "pkg-config" binary, so we used to install
# a symbolic link (now replaced by a wrapper script).
rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"   # delete old version (script or symlink)

echo M4, shell\:
m4 <<"EOF"
translit(esyscmd(`command -v pkg-config'),`')
EOF
echo M4, bash\:
m4 <<"EOF"
translit(esyscmd(`bash -c "command -v pkg-config"'),`')
EOF

# Generate a wrapper script which either calls Sage's 'pkgconf' or a system-
# wide 'pkg-config' if present (hardcoding its location at creation time):
m4 ../patches/pkg-config.in > "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error creating the pkg-config script."
    exit 1
fi

echo Generated script:
echo =================
cat "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
echo =================

chmod 755 "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/pkg-config"
```
(and without `bash -c ...` in `pkg-config.in`), I'm always getting:

```

I still don't get what goes wrong or who's to blame otherwise.




Varying indentation of found vs. ignored `.pc` files is presumably not intentional... ;-)

Is it intentional that the test suite fails if no system-wide `pkg-config` is installed?

(I mean, of course it should "fail", but shouldn't we skip the test in that case?)

Imagine having set `SAGE_CHECK=yes`...  (while having `sage -f -c pkgconf` fail would probably be ok)

Apparently some GNUish non-POSIX interpretation of how `command -v` is supposed to work.

Under "normal"(?) circumstances, bash (even when invoked as `/bin/sh`) returns the path of **any existing** (not necessarily executable or even readable) file "foo" found along `PATH` as the result of `command -v foo`.

In contrast, `bash --posix -c "command -v foo"` acts as expected.




That still doesn't explain why `esyscmd(`bash -c "command -v pkg-config"')` worked for me (without using a temporary file), whereas `esyscmd(`command -v pkg-config')` did not.

Digging through `strace`s, the former calls both `stat()` and `access()`, while the latter only calls `stat()` and seems to be happy with that.
