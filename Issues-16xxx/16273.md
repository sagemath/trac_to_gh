<a id='comment:3'>**Comment 3:**</a>
Fantastic!  Here's a few very small remarks/typos (see below).  Once addressed, this should get a positive review.

- Could we change "6. OPTIONAL: Type "make ptest" to test all examples in the documentation (over 93,000 lines of input!)" to "6. OPTIONAL: Type "make ptest" to test all examples in the documentation (over 200,000 lines of input!)", since:

```
/usr/local/sage/current/src/sage$ grep -r sage: * | grep -v \.c: | grep -v \.cpp | wc -l
212574
```

- "First, install OpenSSL and the OpenSSL development headers on your system if they are not already." --> "First, install OpenSSL and the OpenSSL development headers on your system if they are not already installed." 

- "install.log       Full intall log" -> "install.log       Full install log"

- I'm glad there is a "DIRECTORY LAYOUT" section.  It's not quite perfect, though.   For example, my first question to sage-devel is "where is the temporary build directory when installing packages? (used to be spkg/build)". Looking at DIRECTORY LAYOUT one finds that SAGE_ROOT/tmp is described as "Temporary files when building Sage", which suggests that should be the answer to my question.  However, it just isn't, since, e.g., R is built in "local/var/tmp/sage/build/r-3.0.2.p1".  And there's no symlink involved here either.   This question isn't answered either: "where are the databases? (used to be data/)".

There are other parts which are probably outdated:

```
  As of this writing (Sage 4.8), when building the standard Sage packages,
  1.5 gigabytes of free space are required in this directory (or more if
  ``SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes`` -- see below); the exact amount of required
  space varies from platform to platform.
```
and

```
      After a full build of Sage (as of version 4.8), these subdirectories can
      take up to 6 gigabytes of storage, in total, depending on the platform
      and the block size of the file system.
```
I don't know what these storage requirements should be now, but it's not as important as the other changes being discussed here.
