```
Both Laurent and power series ring elements have a default precision of 20. OTOH, symbolic series expansions need the precision set:

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: 1/(1-t)
1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + t^4 + t^5 + t^6 + t^7 + t^8 + t^9 + t^10 + t^11 + t^12 + t^13 + t^14 + t^15 + t^16 + t^17 + t^18 + t^19 + O(t^20)
sage: var('x')
x
sage: ex=1/(1-x)
sage: ex.series(x)
...
TypeError: series() takes exactly 2 positional arguments (1 given)
```
This ticket proposes to unify the behaviour by allowing the following:

```
sage: ex.series(x)
1 + 1*x + 1*x^2 + 1*x^3 + 1*x^4 + 1*x^5 + 1*x^6 + 1*x^7 + 1*x^8 + 1*x^9 + 1*x^10 + 1*x^11 + 1*x^12 + 1*x^13 + 1*x^14 + 1*x^15 + 1*x^16 + 1*x^17 + 1*x^18 + 1*x^19 + Order(x^20)
```
As this is about reducing surprise for the user both algebra and symbolic series default precision should have the same value, so the ticket should also implement such a global value.

This ticket also deprecates the use of `LaurentSeriesRing_generic.set_default_prec` as it contradicts the immutability of parents and conflicts with the caching of LaurentSeriesRings.

I do not think that `order=-1` is a good default value, as it changes previous behaviour:

Prior to this patch:

```
sage: f = sin(x)^(-2)
....: f.series(x, -1)
1*x^(-2) + Order(1/x)
```

After this patch:

```
sage: f = sin(x)^(-2)
....: f.series(x, -1)
1*x^(-2) + 1/3 + 1/15*x^2 + 2/189*x^4 + 1/675*x^6 + 2/10395*x^8 + 1382/58046625*x^10 + 4/1403325*x^12 + 3617/10854718875*x^14 + 87734/2292899734125*x^16 + 349222/80596287646875*x^18 + Order(x^20)
```

Furthermore, I'd like to see doctests testing the new behaviour.

Finally, `sage.misc.defaults` could be added to the reference manual such that the documentation of all *three* modified methods (symbolic, power, Laurent) could link to that place for setting the default precision.

I think that replacing `int order=-65535` by `order=None` would lead to clearer code at a negligible performance penalty.

Further comments:
* The docstrings of `series_precision` and `set_series_precision` should have `EXAMPLE` sections.
* The parameter `default_prec` of the Laurent series classes should be explained; the only explanation now is in `def default_prec(self)` which should be rephrased anyway ("Set ..." is not correct).
* I'd like to see doctests showing examples on how to construct series with different values for `set_series_precision`
* `:meth:`set_series_precision`` is a dead link.

The default for order is now `None`. The `misc` functions now have examples. The description of `def default_prec(self)` was corrected. I think the `LaurentSeriesRing` method `set_default_prec` should be deprecated as is already hinted. Done.

The general improvement of Laurent series documentation is ticket #12259.

I don't think doctests showing examples on how to construct series with different values for `set_series_precision` should be added. I don't want to encourage frequent usage of the global setting to set single series precisions.

If the link is dead you should do `make doc-clean; make doc`. It will not suffice to `sage -docbuild` since a file was added.

The reason is that `prec` is set but never used.

I concur that we should not encourage the actual frequent usage of the global settings.
However, I'd prefer it to be at least be covered by a test in a "TESTS" section, just to be sure to avoid small errors as the issue outlined above.

I think that the problem is rather the `meth` instead of `func`.
