Sage's `Spec` command currently produces a `Spec` object that derives from, but is not the same as, an `AffineScheme`.  The goal of this ticket is
- merge the existing `Spec` with `AffineScheme` by moving all existing methods of `Spec` to `AffineScheme`;
- upgrade `Spec` to a functor from `CommutativeRings` to `Schemes` (or `Schemes(A)` if a base ring *A* is specified), returning objects of type `AffineScheme`.

Example of the new functionality:

```
sage: A.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Spec(A)
Spectrum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: type(Spec(A))
<class 'sage.schemes.generic.scheme.AffineScheme_with_category'>
sage: B.<t> = QQ[]
sage: f = A.hom((t^2, t^3))
sage: Spec(f)
Affine Scheme morphism:
  From: Spectrum of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
  To:   Spectrum of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
  Defn: Ring morphism:
          From: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
          To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field
          Defn: x |--> t^2
                y |--> t^3
```
Two small user-visible changes had to be made to accommodate the new situation:
- If *S* = Spec(*A*) is an affine scheme, then the syntax `S(a_1, ..., a_n)` to construct the topological point of *S* defined by the prime ideal *P* = (*a*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>*) of *A* is no longer supported.  The syntax `S(A.ideal(a_1, ..., a_n))` now has to be used instead.  This is because it conflicts with the much more useful application of this syntax to construct the point with coordinates (*a*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>*) if *S* is (a subscheme of) an affine space **A**<sup>*n*</sup>.
- Given *S* = Spec(*A*) and another scheme *X*, the result of `X(A)` is the same as before (a point homset), but `X(S)`, which used to be identical to this, now returns the standard scheme homset.  To get the point homset, one now has to type `X(A)` or `X(S.coordinate_ring())`.  This seems the "principle of least surprise" convention to me, and it is consistent with the fact that `X.point_homset()` only accepts rings, not affine schemes.

More improvements to affine schemes are made in #7946.

Hmm...despite not making any changes to that file, it's somehow falling back to the cached version because it wasn't garbage collected. There doesn't seem to be a memory leak as far as I can tell, so I'm thinking it's just hanging around longer in the doctest. In either case, I made the check of the algorithm more robust.

This should be solved by #16680.

Argh, didn't see this in time and made a different fix in #16680.  I think it is a bit silly to check the `algorithm` keyword if we are going to return the cached version anyway.  Maybe we can continue the discussion at #16680?
