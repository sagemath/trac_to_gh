Such scripts should ideally be applied by the release manager right before doing a new stable release.  Not sure whether Volker is aware of this ticket.

For new code / changes, it's up to the reviewers to check no new instances get introduced. ;-)

Thanks Leif. I will ask Volker directly if he does not answer on sage-devel.

The script was not the good one (because of things like "my_variable!=None"), new try

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

for f in $(find . -name "*py");
do
    echo "processing $f"
    sed -i -e's/\ *==\ *None$/ is None/g' $f

I applied it to Sage source code, and obtain 505 occurrences... and Sage even starts after that!!

The cross tool mailing list is [code-quality](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality).

These are the Python guidelines:
* [PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [PEP257 Docstring Conventions](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
* [PEP7 Style Guide for C Code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/)

I had a quick look at them - there is no obvious BEST one.
But it would certainly be worthwhile to select / combine / customize them for use with Sage.

done
```

2) There are few things to fix by hand. For example, some occurrences appear in the docstrings and the script did bad to them (src/sage/ext/gen_interpreters.py, src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/misc.py, ...)

For Wilfried:

Hi,

Thanks Wilfried for providing your script. Your regexps look much nicer than mine!

The syntax for regexp in sed is (almost) the same as in Python! You can write what you did in sed as

```
sed -e's/\s\?==\s*None\b/ is None/g' \
    -e's/\s\?!=\s*None\b/ is not None/g' my_file.py
```

Instead of the for loop, it is faster and cleaner to use xargs. The following one-line command takes care of py and pyx files.

```
find -regex ".*pyx?" | xargs sed -i        \
        -e's/\s\?==\s*None\b/ is None/g'   \
        -e's/\s\?!=\s*None\b/ is not None/g'
```
With the command above I got 637 instances on 6.2.rc0.

At the very last, there are two possibilities to avoid occurrence of "bla == None" in the future (see Volker's answer in [that thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/SN93zx3YnAA)):
- provide a pre-commit hook for git
- modify the "sage -b" command

`-regex` is not portable; one should use `-name \*.py -o -name \*.pyx` [`-o -name \*.rst`] instead.  (And you can also use `sed ... $(find ...)`, or -- preferably -- `find ... -exec sed ...`, because the latter reduces the required size of the environment, i.e. `argv`.)

`sed -i ...` is (unfortunately) also not portable, nor  is `\s`, and IIRC neither `\b` nor `\?`.

`sed` is UNIX from the very beginning, while **G**NU's **N**ot **U**nix! ;-)

Well, in application, there is.

This ticket now has 
* 177 files changed, 515 insertions, 515 deletions
but ticket:15990 had
* 503 files changed, 3138 insertions, 3170 deletions
On the way there were some merge conflict, but nothing serious.


Therefore I'm not afraid about conflicts (for this ticket).

Hi,

1) As I already told you, the substitutions made bad things to the documentation. Hopefully, in very few places. For examples
- `/src/sage/ext/gen_interpreters.py`: we had "so len==None is different than len==1" and now it is "so len is None is different than len==1".  The new sentence is much harder to read.
- `/src/sage/coding/code_bounds.py`: in a comment we had "algorithm==None or algorithm="gap"" would be better to have "algorithm=None or algorithm="gap" (instead of the is None here).
- etc

2) You start removing unnecessary parenthesis. First of all it is not the job of that ticket. Secondly, one can arguably says that code is more readable with more parenthesis. So revert all those changes. If you want to remove parenthesis (which I think is a bad idea in general) then open a discussion on sage-devel and then a ticket if a consensus is reached.

Yep, at least where "is None" isn't typeset as code.

And I also wouldn't touch most of the *comments*.

I'm in general ok with changing the "C style" `if (cond):` and `while (cond):` to usual Python syntax (without *outer* parentheses), but I agree that this should be done on another ticket, especially since currently only *some* instances (namely those in or near the context of other changes) get "normalized".

There are also a couple of conditions where I'd personally change *the order* of evaluation, of the form `if <expensive_test> <and|or> <cheap_test>:`,  but that's also out of the scope of this ticket.

I pushed a fresh start based on Sage 6.2.

From commit message of the manual changes:

```
    * changed "not xxx is None" to "xxx is not None" (where appropriate)
    * reverted changes in docstring text
      - usually did not revert changes to doctest *code*
      - but reverted changes to expected results (if required)
    * (usually) did not revert changes to *code* in comments
    
    Always tried to apply good judgement - but refrained from changes
    unrelated to the subject "is None".
```
