Hi Nathann,

- Could we get rid of `simple_wilson_construction` from #16535 in this ticket or should I open a new one?

- You should provide at least a possibly stupid but non-trivial example of the new construction.

Vincent

Yo !

> - Could we get rid of `simple_wilson_construction` from #16535 in this ticket or should I open a new one?

Be careful, this ticket only depends on #16500 as it was meant to be very local. If you want to touch other parts of the file you should base the changes higher in the patch stack.

> - You should provide at least a possibly stupid but non-trivial example of the new construction.

Are all applications of Wilson's theorem that we have in Sage at the moment "trivial" ? Because that function handles them all `:-P`

The thing is that it is not possible to use this construction for as long as `incomplete_orthogonal_arrays` does not handle holes of size >1.

You can provide the OA explicitly. I mean: as it is, the function gives nothing new! Or more precisely, it does but only in principle... the only current positive effect is to slow down the Wilson construction!

I really think that it is a good thing to have. But with no application in mind it is a bit premature. I will try to build a non-already existing example from the Brouwer-Van Rees paper.

I can provide the `OA` to `wilson_decomposition`, but it will require a OA with holes of size >1 and for this the code will call `incomplete_orthogonal_array`.

> I mean: as it is, the function gives nothing new! Or more precisely, it does but only in principle... the only current positive effect is to slow down the Wilson construction!

Right now it cannot help us compute new designs, indeed. Later, when we will have ways to compute holes of size `>1`, we will be able to use it. I don't work miracles, man. I can just implement constructions. And you can help me by making the `incomplete_orthogonal_arrays` function return OA with bigger holes.

And so what ?... You refuse the patch because of that ?... What do we earn by doing that ?..

You do not need a function to build an incomplete array. Here is the `OA(4,6)-OA(4,2)` from Horton

```
OA = [

[2,1,2,6],[2,2,1,5],[2,3,6,1],[2,4,5,2],[2,5,3,4],[2,6,4,3],

Hi Nathann,

The feature is cool, the doc is especially nice but I am not comfortable by letting it goes before having more IOA. Could we try adding few examples of IOA and put this one on top?

Hi Nathann,

Stupid bugfix for the doc in my commit.

Do you mind if I allow to have `OA=None` in wilson construction and move the code from `simple_wilson_construction` (in `find_orthogonal_array_build.py`) to `wilson_construction` (in `orthogonal_array.py`). It should be fine with your next tickets, but in the future we should get rid of `simple_wilson_construction`.

Hi Nathann,

I moved the code of `simple_wilson_construction` to `wilson_construction`. I had not enough energy to make the explanations for the Brouwer van Rees construction... so it is currently a `NotImplementedError`.

I am happy with the current version, but it would be better to add one line for the explanations.

Vincent

Hello,

You do not have to deprecate this function, it can be removed. It is only internal stuff, not really meant to be called directly.
