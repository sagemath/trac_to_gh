Hi Nathann,

- Could we get rid of `simple_wilson_construction` from #16535 in this ticket or should I open a new one?

- You should provide at least a possibly stupid but non-trivial example of the new construction.

Yo !

> - Could we get rid of `simple_wilson_construction` from #16535 in this ticket or should I open a new one?


Be careful, this ticket only depends on #16500 as it was meant to be very local. If you want to touch other parts of the file you should base the changes higher in the patch stack.

> - You should provide at least a possibly stupid but non-trivial example of the new construction.


Are all applications of Wilson's theorem that we have in Sage at the moment "trivial" ? Because that function handles them all `:-P`

The thing is that it is not possible to use this construction for as long as `incomplete_orthogonal_arrays` does not handle holes of size >1.

You can provide the OA explicitly. I mean: as it is, the function gives nothing new! Or more precisely, it does but only in principle... the only current positive effect is to slow down the Wilson construction!

I really think that it is a good thing to have. But with no application in mind it is a bit premature. I will try to build a non-already existing example from the Brouwer-Van Rees paper.

You do not need a function to build an incomplete array. Here is the `OA(4,6)-OA(4,2)` from Horton

```
OA = [

Here is an additional commit that gives a correct error message when `incomplete_orthogonal_array` cannot build what we need.

I also changed the example for the Brouwer-van Rees construction. While it works, it is a bit sad that it only gives an `OA(5,256)` `:-PPPP`

Anyway...

Hi Nathann,

Stupid bugfix for the doc in my commit.

Do you mind if I allow to have `OA=None` in wilson construction and move the code from `simple_wilson_construction` (in `find_orthogonal_array_build.py`) to `wilson_construction` (in `orthogonal_array.py`). It should be fine with your next tickets, but in the future we should get rid of `simple_wilson_construction`.

Hi Nathann,

I moved the code of `simple_wilson_construction` to `wilson_construction`. I had not enough energy to make the explanations for the Brouwer van Rees construction... so it is currently a `NotImplementedError`.

I am happy with the current version, but it would be better to add one line for the explanations.
