One would like to have something like:

```
sage: W = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: I = [2,3,4]
sage: P = W.parabolic_subgroup(I)
sage: P in FiniteWeylGroups()
True
sage: P.simple_reflections()
Finite family {2: (2,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (4,5)}
```

I just attached proof-of-concept code I had written back in 2010 at
the joint Sage-Combinat/Chevie days.

Further work needed:

- Update the existing `subgroups` methods (for permutation groups,
  matrix groups, ...) so that it accepts

- Implement a class for subsets of an existing set, implemented by
  wrapping elements of the ambient set, as is done in my class
  ReflectionSubgroup.

- Implement a generic default `subgroup` method using the above class,
  and passing by default the category Groups().Subobjects().

- Implement two categories, one for reflection subgroups, and one for
  parabolic subgroups (the later being generated by a subset of the
  simple reflections). CoxeterGroups.SubObjects (or later on
  ReflectionGroups.Subobjects) is probably a good candidate for the
  latter. A name is needed for the former.

- Plug everything together :-)
