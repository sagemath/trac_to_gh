For a field F and for a prime p, ( , )_p denotes the Hilbert Symbol over F localized at p.  It is well known that (a,b)_p*(a,c)_p=(a,bc)_p for any a, b in F (cf O'meara 63:12).  But I'm getting:

* (*a*, -2)<sub>*p*</sub> = -1

PARI also computes (*a*, 2)<sub>*p*</sub> incorrectly.  In the latest version of PARI/GP (2.7.0, not yet in Sage), one has

```
gp > K=nfinit(x^2+5);
gp > p=idealfactor(K,2)[1,1];
gp > a=Mod(x,K.pol);
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,2,p)
%4 = 1  # should be -1
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,-2,p)
%5 = -1
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,-1,p)
%6 = 1
```
Have you reported the bug to the PARI developers?  (See `http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Bugs/Reporting.html` for how to do this.)

I see.  That makes a lot of sense.  I wasn't sure if Sage only updated PARI at major releases or along the way.  In that case, maybe there is not such a great urgency to patch a fix into sage since we should see it reflected soon enough.  

Then just to be clear, should I change the current doctest to reflect the mathematically correct answer, i.e., 


```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+5)
sage: p=K.primes_above(2)[0];p
Fractional ideal (2, a + 1)
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-1,p)
1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,2,p)
-1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-2,p)
-1
```

So that doctests return errors only until the bug is fixed?  And after that point it will just be another nice correct example?  Thanks for the helpful comments!
