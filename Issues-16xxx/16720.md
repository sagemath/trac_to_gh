Turns out that the use of a brain is underrated. I should really buy one someday.

This is what happens when you think before writing a loop:

```
sage -t --long database.py
    [340 tests, 3.20 s]
```

This is what happens when you do not

```
sage -t --long database.py
    [340 tests, 14.43 s]
```

Hello,

I do not understand that

```

+    M = [M[i*18+j] for i in range(len(M)/18) for j in range(9)] # only develop w.r.t the last two coordinates

Ahem `:-PPPPP`

Thaaaaaaaaat's because the rows of the matrix were listed as 111222333 before and now it is 123123123. You don't care about that in an OA or a difference matrix, so it does not matter and it is easier to get this speedup.

The function which I had to modify above called this routine, and only needed to remember the first half of the matrix. Formerly. But now that the rows are listed differently, well getting that "half" of the matrix is a bit different `:-P`

I know it is not "semantically correct". Please don't make me rewrite the function for that `T_T`
