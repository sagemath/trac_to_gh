```
The file sage/src/bin/sage-bdist contains a mistake:
       'ARCHES' should be 'ARCHS'.
The effect of the mistake is that the OS X application is always built as 32-bit ('i386').  This can be seen in the OS X 10.9 app version currently being distributed officially by running the unix command
    $ `file /Applications/Sage-6.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Sage`
which returns
/Applications/sage-6.3.app/Contents/MacOS/Sage: Mach-O executable i386

This mistake is probably not terribly significant for running sage code, since all the files in sage/local/{bin,lib}/ are 64-bit.

(2) There is a second, more obscure mistake in sage-bdist.  sage-bdist uses `uname -m` to determine the target architecture.  Some older 64-bit Macintoshes can only boot into a 32-bit system.  These machines run 64-bit Sage perfectly well.  
They can make and build 64-bit Sage perfectly well.  The problem is that 
`uname -m` returns 'i386' on these machines, so sage-bdist uses 'i386' as the target architecture.

Attached is modified version of sage-bdist which corrects both mistakes.  See below for a description of my modifications.

I am NOT going to submit this via 'git trac'.  As a neophyte, I don't want the responsibility of modifying the build script.

changes in the attached version of sage-bdist:

(1) 'ARCHES' -> 'ARCHS'

(2) I added an environment variable SAGE_APP_TARGET_ARCH to override `uname -m`.  If one is building Sage on an older 64-bit OSX machine that boots into a 32-bit system, one would do
    $ export SAGE_APP_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64
    $ ./sage-bdist

(3) I also added some code to append '-app' to the name 
of the .dmg file produced by sage-bdist.  At present, this has to be done by hand.

(4) I also added an environment variable (SAGE_APP_GZ=no) to prevent 
the final compression stage, to save time during debugging 
sage-bdist.  One would do
    $ export SAGE_APP_GZ=no
    $ export SAGE_APP_DMG=no
    $ ./sage-bdist
in order to skip the final compression.

Seems likely to me as well, though I'd prefer to have Ivan also check out the part that Xcode will see first.  I definitely won't have time to actually try a bdist with this in the next week.

Also, there are now TWO new undocumented variables.  I think that it makes sense to have an example of the appropriate new one introduced here in the installation guide or wherever such variables are documented.  Secondly, I fail to see the point of 

```
elif [ "$SAGE_APP_GZ" != "no" ]; then
```
since the message is pretty clear that the only two options are dmg and not-dmg.  Returning to `else` would remove the need to document that one, at any rate.

Sorry, I didn't see the full description, because I just was thinking about the original discussion.   Both of these now are clear to me but still I think they need to be documented.

Quite.   They are also in the script itself help messages, but that is not the greatest - thanks very much!

If you look at the built doc the outcome one might expect happens from

```
`i386` and `x86_64`
```
instead of

```
``i386`` and ``x86_64``
```
so adding those characters would be good.
