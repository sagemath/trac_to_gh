A couple further thoughts:

Looking at ​dd22351, this indeed looks like an automatic type
recognition starting from a Coxeter diagram or Dynkin diagram, as is
implemented in GAP 3. That's been in the TODO list for a while [1], so
it would be rather cool. If we go this way, this should really be a
method of CartanType and friends, and we should reuse the same
algorithm for this method as in GAP3, except that we have fast graph
isomorphism tests, so we can simplify it a bit. For the name, maybe
this could be `isomorphic_named_cartan_type`. Although we probably
want to return a relabelled Cartan type that exactly matches the
original Cartan type.

This could then, in the long run, be used for any Coxeter group, be it
defined by a Coxeter matrix or concretely by simple reflections and a
product rule: first build the Coxeter diagram by computing the length
of the braid relation between the simple reflections, and then get the
canonical type. Single caveat: if, for a given Coxeter group, all we
have available is the possibility to compute products of such simple
reflections, then we can get stuck computing that order if there is an
infinite braid relation.

For the record real positivity test is implemented, with guaranteed
result, in UCF:

```
sage: x = UniversalCyclotomicField().an_element()
sage: x.is_real_positive()
```
Maybe this is a simpler way to go.

If the user knows right away that the groupe is finite (or infinite),
then he should just pass that information on with a
`category=CoxeterGroups().Finite()` argument.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas
