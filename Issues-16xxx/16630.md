A few thoughts:

- If the finiteness testing algorithm is slow, we might want to add an option to provide the necessary info right away.

- The algorithm does a lot more than finiteness checking: it breaks the group into irreducibles, and (with some modification) should be able to build an explicit isomorphism of a finite Coxeter group to a direct product of classical Cartan-type groups. Methinks we should make use of this. Should this isomorphism be cached?

A couple further thoughts:

Looking at ​dd22351, this indeed looks like an automatic type
recognition starting from a Coxeter diagram or Dynkin diagram, as is
implemented in GAP 3. That's been in the TODO list for a while [1], so
it would be rather cool. If we go this way, this should really be a
method of CartanType and friends, and we should reuse the same
algorithm for this method as in GAP3, except that we have fast graph
isomorphism tests, so we can simplify it a bit. For the name, maybe
this could be `isomorphic_named_cartan_type`. Although we probably
want to return a relabelled Cartan type that exactly matches the
original Cartan type.

This could then, in the long run, be used for any Coxeter group, be it
defined by a Coxeter matrix or concretely by simple reflections and a
product rule: first build the Coxeter diagram by computing the length
of the braid relation between the simple reflections, and then get the
canonical type. Single caveat: if, for a given Coxeter group, all we
have available is the possibility to compute products of such simple
reflections, then we can get stuck computing that order if there is an
infinite braid relation.

For the record real positivity test is implemented, with guaranteed
result, in UCF:

```
sage: x = UniversalCyclotomicField().an_element()
sage: x.is_real_positive()
```
Maybe this is a simpler way to go.

If the user knows right away that the groupe is finite (or infinite),
then he should just pass that information on with a
`category=CoxeterGroups().Finite()` argument.

Cheers,
                                Nicolas

Notes for Darij from our discussion:

- Make the finiteness check a separate static function.
- Make the testing for #16630 more systematic using something like

```
sage: all(CoxeterGroup(ct) in CoxeterGroups().Finite() for ct in some_list_of_types)
True
```

I renamed this method `order`, which is the real cause of the issue why `cardinality` from `FiniteEnumeratedSets` isn't working properly (and `order` raises a `NotImplementedError` where it shouldn't either). I also refined the category to `Infinite` if the group is not finite.

Note that I cherry-picked your commits into this branch (since I don't want to upgrade my copy of Sage today).
