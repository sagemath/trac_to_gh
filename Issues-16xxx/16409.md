* I fixed "absolute_import" and "map" cases. It tests OK.
* I will check the "operator" case later. 

The redefinition of `next()` in `sage/combinat/integer_list.py` has the text `INTERNAL FUNCTION! DO NOT USE DIRECTLY!`.
At the top of the module it says

```
IMPORTANT NOTE (2009/02):
The internal functions in this file will be deprecated soon.
Please only use them through :class:`IntegerListsLex`.
```
Travis, what would you suggest? - The deprecation has not yet happened, but I do not find it obvious how to fix ...
