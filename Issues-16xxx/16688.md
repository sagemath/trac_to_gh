This meta-ticket tracks efforts to replace pexpect interface calls with library calls, in order to minimize the usage of expect for time-critical code. Packages used by Sage where this seems possible include

* mwrank
* GAP (#26902)
* Singular (no ticket but see related #11957)
* ECL/Maxima (#17753)
* PARI/GP (a few scripts #16687)

The following packages are used via pexpect in the Sage library (noninteractively) and these calls should be replaced somehow in
the long term (this is a wishlist):

* Axiom (through fricas)
* giac (first step: make `giacpy_sage` standard: #28918, second step: integration #31873)
* kash
* Macaulay2
* Octave
* qepcad
* Scilab (two unused functions in `matrix/matrix1.pyx`)

<a id='comment:3'></a>Further motivation for this:

```
sage: scilab(str(range(20)))  # works
sage: scilab(str(range(30)))  # BOOM!
```

(Note -- scilab(range(20)) doesn't work but should!)

And also

```
sage: r(range(30))  # works
sage: r(range(10000)) # boom
```

Worksheet with the above: https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects/4a5f0542-5873-4eed-a85c-a18c706e8bcd/files/support/2015-02-04-062417-scilab-limits.sagews

These sorts of problems were reported by many people over the years, most recently by JC Boulet  of INRA.

There is, especially when you're programming both sides. You can have two processes communicate through a pipe or stream without one of the parties pretending to be a terminal.

That said, the fact that the notebook *does* use pexpect makes it easier to use it to interface with R, octave, magma, etc, so we do get some benefit from it.

As the author of exactly the part of the notebook that uses pexpect, etc., I don't agree with this statement so much -- instead, the two are somewhat orthogonal.   The connection (1) "notebook_server <--> python processes" is done using pexpect in sagenb.  The interfaces to R/octave/magma, etc. are connections (2) "python processes <--> R/octave/magma/etc.".   You can certainly swap out (1) for a connection built using TCP (rather than pexpect) with no impact on (2); in fact, that's precisely what I did with SageMathCloud. 

That said, maybe you just meant that work on the abstract base class Expect for the interfaces benefits both sagenb and the R/octave/magma, etc., interfaces...
