Spent a lifetime on that because I had not noticed that I was first enumerating elements using a list L, then enumerating the same elements using `{x:i for i,x in enumerate(L)}`. And of course that was not the same ordering `T_T`

Hi Nathann,

Why do you use this strange convention about rows/cols? From the Handbook chapter 17, there are k rows and lambda |G| columns...

I think that it will be easier to work with k columns. Look at the OA code, we spend our lifetime creating rows for every set of a PBD, or developping rows according to some groups... For instance look at the doc you just wrote for the helper function : you have one row in your matrix, and you let this H hyperplane act on it to generate new rows.

If you want to add columns instead it becomes a mess, you have to extend each column instead of just adding a row to the matrix.

By the way, many cals to `OA_from_quasi_difference_matrix` are already preceded by a `M=zip(*M) # transpose M`. Actually, I am looking at database.py and really a LOT of code would be simplified by changing that: look how often you have code like that to create the matrices:

```
for <something>:
    M[0].append(e)
    M[1].append(f)
    ....
```

If all that was the transpose instead, we would just have to write:

```
for <something>:
    M.append([e,f,...])
```

What do you think ?

- rewrite the documentation appropriately and warn the reader that the convention is different from the Handbook,

I added a small check before `M = zip(*M)` because this operation takes the min of the length of the lists in M:

```
sage: zip([1],[2],[3,4,5,6])

Hello,

1) Why do you transpose the matrix to check the definition? You would avoid many multiplications in `x_minus_y[M_c[ii*K+i]][M_c[ii*K+j]]`.

2) I do not like the order of the argument. For orthogonal arrays it is OA, k, n, but here it is G, k, M... I would prefer G,M,k.

3) We can win a lot of time with a C array for `x_minus_y` and `seen_values`. It is at `u/vdelecroix/16797`

Yo !

> 1) Why do you transpose the matrix to check the definition?

When we will change the definition to have k columns instead of k rows we will just have to remove the block of lines before the transposition.

> You would avoid many multiplications in `x_minus_y[M_c[ii*K+i]][M_c[ii*K+j]]`.

I am not sure that we pay these multiplications. Because of your experience with `is_sum_of_square` and my useless optimization in `is_orthogonal_array`

Well, with the Cython version of x_minus_y (at public/16797) your example takes 15ms, but what I get when I try with your branch is a segfault

I don't know. For difference family it is `D,G` and not `G,D`.

I like the rest... do what you want with the input and set to positive review.
