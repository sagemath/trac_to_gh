<a id='comment:7'></a>I think that it will be easier to work with k columns.

If you want to add columns instead it becomes a mess, you have to extend each column instead of just adding a row to the matrix.

By the way, many cals to `OA_from_quasi_difference_matrix` are already preceded by a `M=zip(*M) # transpose M`. Actually, I am looking at database.py and really a LOT of code would be simplified by changing that: look how often you have code like that to create the matrices:

```
for <something>:
    M[0].append(e)
    M[1].append(f)
    ....
```

If all that was the transpose instead, we would just have to write:

```
for <something>:
    M.append([e,f,...])
```

What do you think ?

2) I do not like the order of the argument. For orthogonal arrays it is OA, k, n, but here it is G, k, M... I would prefer G,M,k.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Yo !

> 1) Why do you transpose the matrix to check the definition?


When we will change the definition to have k columns instead of k rows we will just have to remove the block of lines before the transposition.

> You would avoid many multiplications in `x_minus_y[M_c[ii*K+i]][M_c[ii*K+j]]`.


I am not sure that we pay these multiplications. Because of your experience with `is_sum_of_square` and my useless optimization in `is_orthogonal_array`

> 2) I do not like the order of the argument. For orthogonal arrays it is OA, k, n, but here it is G, k, M... I would prefer G,M,k.


If you prefer ...

I was not sure that it would make a difference, thus I kept the Cython version. Do you have timings ?

Well, with the Cython version of x_minus_y (at public/16797) your example takes 15ms, but what I get when I try with your branch is a segfault

```
sage: sage: from sage.combinat.designs.designs_pyx import is_difference_matrix
sage: sage: q = 5**3
sage: sage: F = GF(q,'x')
sage: sage: M = [[x*y for y in F] for x in F]
sage: sage: timeit("is_difference_matrix(F,q,M)")
