Pari has a numeric implementation:

```
? 1/agm(1,sqrt(2))
%1 = 0.83462684167407318628142973279904680900
```
but Wikipedia provides a closed form integral expression, and if we had the "complete elliptic integral of the first kind" this would be even simpler.

Numerically there is `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber`.
