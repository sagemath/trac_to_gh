<a id='comment:2'></a>Hellloooooooooo !!

Here is a commit (at `public/16863`) that also handles prime powers (not just primes) as the wikipedia source claims.

What it does:

- Change the doctests to test all new cases (also a bit faster than the previous doctest)
- rename `fact` to `factorization`
- Add a reference toward wikipedia
- Use `[x**2 for x in SET]` to compute the list of squares.

Your turn !

Nathann

<a id='comment:3'></a>Thanks for the modif!

I changed one sentence in the comments and used a "set version" of the fields in the code (see the last commit).

Needs review again...
