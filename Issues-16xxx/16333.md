Here is a link to the lrs page (which has relevant papers there): http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/C/lrslib/USERGUIDE.html

This is what I would think as best way to go (as stated in Gambit FAQ: lrs is more robust) but that paper (pointed out by kcrisman) which points at Gambit will be super useful to evaluate the best way to go.

Where is this FAQ?  I couldn't find it easily.

Thinking out loud below:

* lrs seems to just be about polytopes - useful, to be sure, but I'm just wondering whether reinventing the entire rest of the Gambit wheel is a great idea.  For instance, Gambit's McKelvey was THE McKelvey.  How much of lrs do we really need for finding equilibria, as opposed to all the other many things one does in game theory?
* However, Gambit doesn't talk about cooperative or matching game theory (tickets #16332, #16331)
* Maybe it would be worth talking to the Gambit folks [directly](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom+to+University+of+East+Anglia,+Norwich,+United+Kingdom&saddr=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom&daddr=University+of+East+Anglia,+Norwich,+United+Kingdom&hl=en&sll=42.515595,-70.847233&sspn=0.092114,0.149517&geocode=FaOfEQMdkH7P_yHKInGeCcdt4CmvKwE2vRxuSDHKInGeCcdt4A%3BFWLyIgMdiOgSACFz5UQH8Hu5uSkBWIB72ODZRzFz5UQH8Hu5uQ&oq=Cardiff+University,+Cardiff,+United+Kingdom+to+university+of+east+a&t=h&z=8) about how/whether any common work would be useful?

Yeah all fair comments: I'll get in touch with the Gambit folk (they're a very short drive from where I am) and see what they think.

I like the idea of having wrapper classes that could make use of Sage's ability to show things in an aesthetically pleasing way, anything involving latex would be great for example.
> it would be nice for there to be a standard format for representing things, you know?

I agree, gambit actually uses its own .efg and .nfg file formats for representing games with the aim of them being easily readable by humans. Given that there isn't much else out there they may become a standard themselves.

Yes!  Just like

```
sage: graphs.[tab]

matroids.PG               matroids.Whirl

This would be awesome, a built-in library one could explore of basic examples.

The LaTeX representation of things will be minor tweaks I imagine. It's all about making sure we get the general structure of Gambit games and 'our games' aligned so that we can talk to 'Gambit' in the right way... We won't rush this: important to get it right.

Hi!

James has just pushed a pretty substantial piece of work. This creates a `NormalFormGame` class that brings with it 3 algorithms to compute equilibria:

1. LCP (a gambit algorithm)
2. lrs
3. A bespoke support enumeration algorithm (this is the slowest of algorithms but allows users to find equilibria if the above two packages aren't installed).

There is also a lot of documentation that has been written (and it builds! :)). Finally, if it's of interest we're actively continuously testing this by generating random games and trying all 3 algorithms. You can find a bunch of plots (and the raw data) here: https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory.

Hi!  I don't see anything at https://github.com/theref/sage-game-theory except the readme, which I am pretty sure is not what it was earlier in the summer.

Also, have you tested this with and without gambit installed?  (I'm having difficult finding the code right now because of some broken links on Trac as well, so my apologies.)

Very broad comments:
* The following file seems unhelpful - src/sage/game_theory/installing_gambit.md

```
    mv gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz SAGE_ROOT/upstream
    cd SAGE_ROOT
    ./sage -i gambit
```
   would that even work without #16466?
* old.py is always a frightening name for a file in a professional package ;-)
Maybe there is a more updated version of this stuff coming?  I don't see anything from August, for instance.

I'm having to do this on my phone as my laptop has just died which is a bit of a nightmare as I'm at my mother's all weekend so won't be able to work on this like I was hoping! 

Re github, if you click on the branches you can see that we've set the landing page to be the read me branch with nothing in it. If you look at branch 16333 you'll see the relevant code for this ticket. If you look through the issues on there also you'll see that James and I tried to document this whole process so any decisions that were not obvious are on there :) 

Re with and without gambit: this was tricky to test as 'uninstalling' an optional Sage package proved to be difficult. We did however test on various machines with and without Gambit installed and I'm pretty sure that it works just fine. If it doesn't it's just that we ran out of Gambit-less machines and made a tweak that might be missing a try except statement. So it would be an easy fix but we certainly tried our best (and I'm almost 100% sure we succeeded) to make sure that Gambit is not a requirement but an enhancement.

That is in fact there to help if anyone wanted to get Gambit working prior to 16466 being fixed (which it needs to be)  and approved. It would/should work if the instructions are followed (I tested this on my own machine). We thought that this is mainly useful for devs/reviewers.

Yeah old.py should be deleted (I'll call that a lazy relic). A part from that issue this is pretty much just waiting for a review (I've been too busy with other things this month to bug people :)). 

Thanks again, and really sorry if I'm unable to work on things immediately. Currently having my heart broken by a flashing hard disk error...

Hello Vince ! It would be really cool if you made your branch a bit more 'reviewer-friendly'. Right now it seems to follow the development history, but you want this to be re-read by somebody and it would be nice to not have a commit that fixes a bug introduced in a previous commit.

With git, you can very easily merge commits together, as part of the rebase command. Try something like that:

- Checkout your branch, and type 'git checkout -b rebased_version'. This, to make sure that we do not touch your old branch so nothing can go wrong.
- 'git rebase -i develop'. This will 'replay' all your commits on top of the latest develop version. It will open a text editor, and you will see how easy it is to merge two commits, or reorder them.

At the end of this procedure, the branch `rebased_version` will be on top of the latest develop version, and its history should be cleaner. You can call 'git rebase -i develop' several times if needed.

Hope that will help.

Nathann

Correct on both accounts. Both fixed now (thanks!).

This would be a good place to refer to the gambit document or remind why there are all these `int`s.

Maybe better now is "the various algorithms"?

Finally, I think the parser is working fine but could use a little extra tlc if and when games with more than 2 players are implemented, as it is a very long series of things to parse for the reader (I mean the code like `profile.append(tuple(gambitstrategy[previousplayerstrategylength: previousplayerstrategylength + len(player.strategies)]))`) though I agree it should work correctly.

I don't see any other issues.  Thanks for breaking all of these tickets apart!  It really made it a lot easier to get figured out.

I've added a pointer to the gambit documentation. Let me know if you think I've said too much/little.

Yup: have put that in.

I agree, I'm hoping that future dev will further integrate all the gambit algorithms, as this happens the parser will be in turn expanded. The next thing I'll be working on is #17392 though :)

A few more things, largely about the gambit docs document.
* It's capitalized `IPython`, for whatever reason - the gambit docs thing is not correct that way, I missed it earlier.
* Here

```
The `python API documentation for gambit
<http://www.gambit-project.org/gambit14/pyapi.html>_` 
```
  I think the syntax needs to put the underscore after the backtick.
* There are several things in single backticks (like ``LCP``, but look for them, it's not the only one) that should be in double backticks ```LCP```.

Otherwise I think we are okay.

Pretty sure I caught these now.

Yup: have fixed.

Looked for these and think there was just that one that I recognised. I did find various things in single back ticks but I think there done so correctly, I might well be confused by the syntax though: if you could point out one that is not right that should clarify what I'm misunderstanding and I'll go ahead and fix all the rest. (Apologies for not finding these, have built the docs and read through but think I'm just missing it).

Thanks again :)

A good idea!   I also (nearly) did that.

[This commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/70b61ab33aef1500ded86d5c750c7fe379f76b0c) actually makes it worse; it changes one `IPython` and then doesn't correctly fix an `ipython`.
