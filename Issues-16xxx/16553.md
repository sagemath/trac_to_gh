In #16552 we discovered that `IncidenceStructure` is not adapted to deal with projective spaces. The class should be able:
- to be a base class for inheritance to create other designs (like `GDD` or specialized one such as `DesarguesianProjectivePlane`)
- ... (maybe more)

Well, the points of the dual incidence structure could be ... Sets ?.. Or tuples. I mean, the labels of the points of a dual incidence structure could be the blocks of the original incidence structure.

ANd of course, the blocks would be .. Sets of points from the ground set ?

That's what we want, isn't it ?

> - A better name for `IncidenceStructure` would be `Design`...


Or hypergraph ?... A friend of mine says "geometry" instead of "hypergraph". Truth it, an incidence structure is a pretty general thing :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_structure

> and we also need a class for `GroupDivisibleDesign` and for them we need an other bijection `groups <-> {0, ..., g-1}`.


Well, we may need to have ".groups()" indeed. We would have GDD at the bottom, them PBD, BIBD, transversal designs...

The main problem is that orthogonal arrays are not really designs in this sense.

This is confusing. Basically, we do not care too much about the data type of the blocks as soon as `__len__`, `__iter__` and `__contains__` are correctly implemented, right... But it does not work with dual.

One option is to do like posets where the ordering is implemented in the poset itself and not in the elements. We would implement the incidence structure at the level of `IncidenceStructure` and not at the level of points/blocks. In other words we would forbid `p in block`.

Yes, we need `Hypergraph.to_incidence_structure` and `IncidenceStructure.to_hypergraph`... or only one class?

Yeah, let's make it impossible to iterate on blocks. That will be better.

Forget about hypergraphs for the moment. Nobody but I knows it exists, and it can do nothing useful except displaying stuff, and once more I am the only one who knows that it does that `:-P`

Incidence Structure will be the most basic thing we have. Then we will have GDD, then all we need above that.

No, that points are blocks of the dual!

Because the blocks of the duals are the point. And the dual of the dual is (canonically isomorphic) to the initial design.

Handbook definition I.1.5. If it is not standard I can change it. To me, `degree` looks more natural.

By the way, `is_t_design` is wrong as it is written. Turns out that you cannot write this function without "knowing" the value of `t`. There is no such thing as "the largest t such that a design is a `t`-design.

Why not? It is well defined as soon as `t` is assumed to be smaller than the block size. Note that if you have a t-(v,k,lambda) design it is also a s-(v,k,lambda_s) design with 

```
lambda_s = lambda binomial(v-s,t-s) / binomial(k-s,t-s).
```
(Handbook theorem II.4.8)

I think that we should forbid lambda=0, that's all.

And actually:
- a design whose blocks have all the same lenght is a 0-design
- a 0-design for which each point has the same degree is a 1-design

I should modify the function to take care of that...

Good idea ! It will also remove these 9 functions we don't need

<a id='comment:31'></a>Hi Nathann,

As I completely rewrote the infrastructure it does not make much sense to have separated commits. I decided to implement a `t_design_parameters` (as a cached method) and a `is_t_design`. It is much more readable that way.

I am not sure what to do with the caching of degrees... for sure we do not want to do it on startup. And for now, as the datastructure is still in basic state I vote for keeping it the way it is. If we will cache it in the future then we should remove the ``@`cached_method` on `t_design_parameters`.

Neeeeeds review!

done. But it is not clear to me:
- are we allowed to modify the output of `blocks`?
- are we allowed to modify the output of `__iter__`?

If both answers are yes, then there are copy anyway (I did not implement the copy=False idea).

It has nothing to do here (in the doc of `AffineGeometryDesign`).

The same test above is copied I guess 5 times all over the place.

It is not automatically set up to `not __eq__`. You should learn your python

```
sage: class A(object):
....:     def __eq__(self, other):
....:         return True
....:     
sage: a = A()
sage: b = A()
sage: a == b
True
sage: a != b
True
```

It was. Now if the input is a matrix there is a check

removed, it was equivalent to .degrees(1)

removed, it was equivalent to .degrees(2)

degrees can not be in another commit since it is used in `.is_t_design`. I
implemented a more reasonable version (but a bit ugly because of the cached_method
over an iterator...)

The point is that we cannot cache any answer unless the design is immutable. Then, if it is immutable we can do things like store the blocks internally as tuples. This way we can write `__iter__` by returning the blocks directly, and they will not be modified by the user.

For `.blocks()`, we can (by default) return a copy of them or (if the user asks) return the thing directly.

Ideally, we could have `copy=True/False` arguments in the constructor and in `blocks()`. This way, if the user (=us, the developpers) say `copy=False` it means that we know that we are doing and that no copy occurs.

We can also do this when we compute a design without this class wrapping, then return the design. We can set `copy=False` and return the new design as we know that nobody else will modify the lists afterwards.

Okay

Okay.

Those two things are the kind of stuff that is pretty hard to find out while looking at the diff file unless you explain it....

Okayyy...

This function was already implemented before.

Easiest way: store everything as tuple of tuples. Is it ok for you?

It was badly implemented. You can cut the last loop on `t` quickly most of the time.

This one is a `0-(4,0,3)` design

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure(range(4), [[],[],[]])
sage: I.is_block_design()
(False, [0, 0, 0, 0])
```
And this one is a `0-(4,1,2)` design

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure(range(4), [[0],[1]])
sage: I.is_block_design()
False
```
And this one is a `1-(4,1,1)` design

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure(range(4), [[0],[1],[2],[3]])
sage: I.is_block_design()
(False, [0, 0, 0, 0])
```

I broke it into several pieces in order to allow an argument `t` to the function. But I agree that comparing to the old version I can do much better with the degree stuff...

That's hardly a problem if we do a copy for blocks anyway. Plus one can directly access `._points` to avoid that. But agreed, it's not a very bad problem anyway.

<a id='comment:55'></a>Hi Nathann,

Sorry, I was being stupid... With the last commit, it is back to normal.

I still have a `_t_design_parameters(self,t)` (that only depends on `t`) and a `is_t_design(self,t,v,k,l)`. We can always make only one function using an "output wrapper":

```
def make_the_output_the_user_want(t,v,k,l,vv,tt,kk,ll,return_parameters):
    ....
```
but I prefer the current version. Better idea?

EDIT: possibility, have only one parameter in `is_t_design`. But I think that it is very cool to have all of them available.

What do you think of having only a `is_t_design(t=None,v=None,k=None,l=None)` ?

It would return pairs `(a_boolean,(t,v,k,l))`, such that the parameter is equal to the parameter given as input unless it was equal to `None` ?

It is easy to guess `v,k`, you already did the job for `t`, and as I don't think anybody will want to compute `B.is_t_design(l=395)` I guess we can say that "t must be defined if lambda is defined". I don't think anybody would complain.

It can be implemented anyway if needed, it will just be ugly.

I would like it for sure if its purpose was only to return a boolean! A function that starts with `is` must return a boolean, otherwise it is a mess:

```
if m.is_even():
    print "m is even"
```
bad luck: `.is_even()` return a pair "(boolean, m divided by 2)" (remember the concrete example in #16464).

I do not understand your point, in [comment:58] you proposed `is_t_design(self,t,v,k,l)`. Now, you want to keep the `return_parameters=False/True`. Fine, but it will be ugly if you make only one function.

Not anymore. I will.

Yes, because of the reordering of the columns. But we can avoid reordering the columns and keep the matrix. But then, matrices are mutable... hopefully, we can do `m.set_immutable()` as soon as we use it.

> - `is_simple()` does not work when the input is not copied and not necessarily sorted.


And the implementation is stupid, if the blocks are sorted, one would do

```
B = self._blocks
return any(B[i] == B[i+1] for i in xrange(len(B)-1))
```


And... Haaaa.... it is very bad to reorder the blocks:

```
sage: D = designs.IncidenceStructure(2, [[0]])
sage: D == D.dual().dual()
False
```
Taking dual should just be matrix transposition!! One question: what do you think of **not** reordering the blocks? (which is a different from the question "sorting each block")

I don't like it, because I don't trust complicated datatypes. What do we earn by storing this as a matrix ? I expect it to be heavier (because it has to remember the '1' in each cell, it is not meant to be a binary matrix) and less practical (we iterate on the blocks all day long)..

The best data structure for this is a bipartite graph, isn't it ?

But even then, I personally prefer simple data types. Otherwise we will constantly do work on list of lists, translate everything to a matrix/graph, then export everything to list of lists, then build another incidence structure ...

What do you think ?

Right.

It is the same as a binary matrix...

True, but we have to fix the way it is stored, otherwise everything is broken (e.g. equality, `is_simple`). Let's go for sorted tuples of sorted tuples of integers and add a flag `do_not_copy_or_check_the_input_and_I_am_sure_that_it_is_what_I_want` in the constructor. Is that good for you?

Now: 
- `._points` are the points
- `._point_index` might be `None` or a correspondence between point and integers
- `._blocks` is a sorted tuple of sorted blocks on {0, ..., v-1}
(It is explained in the documentation)

I also removed all other hidden attributes. All doctest pass, and doc builds.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I would say that the best is to sort the input even when `copy=False`, what do you think ? With a warning in the documentation of the `copy` argument of course, saying that the list/blocks will be reordered (and that the user should not touch that) ?...

This being said, the way equality is written it will still return false negatives as `[1,2,3] != (1,2,3)` ...

Two questions:

- What about renaming `_point_index` to `_point_to_index` to make its purpose clearer ?

- Should `block_sizes` return `map(len,self._blocks)` or wrap them in a `set` ?

Too bad that it is not very easy to have everything work with a "copy" argument `:-/`

no problem.

You are right, it is the way it was before. So I will put it back. And just for fun, here is the verbatim old implementation:

```
def block_sizes(self):
    self._block_sizes = map(len, self.blocks())
    return self._block_sizes
```

> Too bad that it is not very easy to have everything work with a "copy" argument `:-/`


All right: I can put it back, but assume that the user feed the object with sorted tuples of tuples. It is not that complicated. Is that ok for you? I would like it to not waste my time with the constructor.

Not for this ticket
- right now the structure are immutable but it would makes sense to have mutable ones (that can be turn into immutable ones). For example, removing/adding blocks that contain a given point is a useful operation...

What we can do is something like "set 'copy=False' if you do not want the constructor to make a copy of your data, but know that it will be modified. Use this flag only if you will not use your data anymore afterwards, or if you know what you are doing".
