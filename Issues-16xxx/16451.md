Currently in a tensor product of crystals, we search through all elements and filter. However if given a highest weight element in a tensor product `a (x) b`, then `b` must be highest weight. This means we can use a backtracing algorithm to find all highest weight elements which this ticket implements.

This first implements the categories of tensor products of crystals (currently all crystal subcategories are monoidal under tensor products).

This also changes the output of the current `highest_weight_vectors()` to return a tuple since we don't want to allow modifications to the output of a `@cached_method`.

As far as I can tell, this is independent of #16001.

Nicolas, can you make a quick check to make sure I'm doing everything correctly? If I am, I think I've found a bug for `Modules`:

```
sage: Modules(QQ).TensorProducts()
Category of objects
```

Hey Anne,

Nicolas looked at the category code and layout today and I made the necessary changes. The only thing needing review is the backtracing algorithm in `highest_weight_crystals.py`; would you be willing to finish the review.

Thanks,
