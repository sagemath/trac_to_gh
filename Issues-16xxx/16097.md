<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

In Python 2, `isinstance(f, file)` is not equivalent to `isinstance(f, io.IOBase)`.

I do give positive_review to the change from `file()` to `open()`.

Only the `desc` parameter is deprecated there, not `data` being an instance of `file`.

Deprecation of `isinstance(data, file)` will be done in another ticket.
