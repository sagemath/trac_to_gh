In `src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py`, the code
for the `derivative` method of the `InterfaceInit` class starts
with [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9.3.rc1/src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py#L586):

```
        #This code should probably be moved into the interface
        #object in a nice way.
