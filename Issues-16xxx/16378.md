Normally, `L` should be changed to `list(enumerate(L))` so that this works fine, but apparently we are finally tripping the `pass` created when we get a `TypeError` in this branch of `list_plot`.  I'm not sure where this happened yet, though.

I think what's happening is that at line 1792, a TypeError is thrown.

```
try:
    from sage.rings.all import RDF #1791
    tmp = RDF(data[0]) #1792
    data = list(enumerate(data)) #1793
except TypeError:
    pass
try:
    if plotjoined:
        return line(data, **kwargs)
    else:
        return point(data, **kwargs)
except (TypeError, IndexError):
    # Assume we have complex-valued input and plot real and imaginary parts.
    # Need to catch IndexError because if data is, say, [(0, 1), (1, I)],
    # point3d() throws an IndexError on the (0,1) before it ever
    # gets to (1, I).
    from sage.rings.complex_field import ComplexField
    CC = ComplexField()
    # if we get here, we already did "list(enumerate(data))",
    # so look at z[1] in inner list
    data = [(z.real(), z.imag()) for z in [CC(z[1]) for z in data]] # LINE 1810
    if plotjoined:
        return line(data, **kwargs)
    else:
        return point(data, **kwargs)
```

I tested this theory by running this code in a sage worksheet on SMC:

```
from sage.rings.all import RDF
data = [1+i,4+i,4+2*i,2+2*i,2+3*i,1+3*i,1+i]
tmp = RDF(data[0])
```
Which throws a TypeError saying "TypeError: Unable to convert 1.0 + 1.0*I to float; use abs() or real_part() as desired".

That makes sense but that ends up skipping line 1793 where we need data = list(enumerate(data)) to occur. I could add data = list(enumerate(data)) at line 1809 and I think that would solve the issue since that's the case where you have complex-valued input.

I tried this snippet, again in SMC, which does produce the desired output as far as I can tell.

```
from sage.rings.all import RDF
data = [1+i,4+i,4+2*i,2+2*i,2+3*i,1+3*i,1+i]
data = list(enumerate(data))
from sage.rings.complex_field import ComplexField
CC = ComplexField()
data = [(z.real(), z.imag()) for z in [CC(z[1]) for z in data]]
point(data)
```

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:6\" align=\"right\">comment:6</div>\n\nThanks for adding the full details; that is exactly what I was alluding to.  The question is **why** this is happening now, because I don't think this behavior of `RDF(data[0])` is any different from before (well, the error message is somewhat different, but a `TypeError` is raised even in much older version of Sage, as it should be) - hence my saying \"finally\".  \n\nAnd I'm stumped on that.  In 5.12 all is well.  I hate to have to bisect things, though I agree that adding the line in the place you mention should work, but my suspicion is that there is another change/bug involved and it would be best to get to the bottom of this  - in case it was fixed another time and then we ended up enumerating an enumerated list, causing a different bug.",

Thanks for adding the full details; that is exactly what I was alluding to.  The question is **why** this is happening now, because I don't think this behavior of `RDF(data[0])` is any different from before (well, the error message is somewhat different, but a `TypeError` is raised even in much older version of Sage, as it should be) - hence my saying "finally".  

And I'm stumped on that.  In 5.12 all is well.  I hate to have to bisect things, though I agree that adding the line in the place you mention should work, but my suspicion is that there is another change/bug involved and it would be best to get to the bottom of this  - in case it was fixed another time and then we ended up enumerating an enumerated list, causing a different bug.

Thanks - I haven't had enough working installations around lately, but this will undoubtedly make it easier to track down.

In fact, I see one thing already - `zip(range(len(data)), data)` is functionally equivalent to `enumerate(data)`, and so apparently someone got too cute.  I should be able to track down where this change was made now momentarily.

commit 603ea722edbbd46d2dcde0abb6c85f32ef6cdf18

    allow numpy arrays in list_plot, line, points
```
He's very efficient and knowledgeable and it should not be hard to get a fix in soon, maybe even in 6.3.  The reason this wasn't caught is because 

```

    try:
        from sage.rings.all import RDF
        tmp = RDF(data[0])
        data = list(enumerate(data))

```
and in all the examples in the documentation, you ***can*** put the first element in the list into `RDF`!  So we should be more careful; any one element could be complex and that would be enough to need the enumerate.

Sorry guys. Looks like I failed to notice this in #11787.

The reason to move away from

```
if not isinstance(data[0], (list, tuple)):
```
is because of the introduction of numpy arrays. The following would break otherwise

```
sage: A = numpy.array([[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]])
sage: list_plot(A)       # this is fine now with the RDF() check

sage: A[0]               # even though A[0] is a two dimensional object...
array([1, 2])            # ... it is neither a tuple nor a list (see below)

sage: isinstance(A[0], (list, tuple))
False
```
I went through many iterations in #11787 to completely avoid importing numpy unnecessarily. I will be adding a patch shortly to check for elements in `SR`.
