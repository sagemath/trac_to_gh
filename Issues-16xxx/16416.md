`AtlasRep` is needed for a functioning `TomLib` GAP package, which we do provide, but which is broken due to this.

See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.support/34446

The updated upstream tarball is here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.7.4.20140531.tar.bz2

NB: we do not attempt to make sure that the full functionality (interaction with an online database via http, which needs either another GAP package, IO, or `wget`) of `AtlasRep` is available (it appears to work OK on Linux, but only partially on OSX which does nto have `wget` installed). This is for another ticket.

download the tarball to `$SAGEROOT/upstream` and then run sage -f gap_packages

it will work then.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A10):

this addresses both the branch mess (sorry, my fault!) and the tarball naming.

I also checked that `AtlasRep` works just fine on OSX if one installs `wget` (to some global place like `/usr/local/bin`).
[`wget`](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.14.tar.gz) builds just fine on OSX 10.9.3 if configured with 

```
./configure --with-ssl=openssl
```
