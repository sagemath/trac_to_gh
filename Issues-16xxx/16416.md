`AtlasRep` is needed for a functioning `TomLib` GAP package, which we do provide, but which is broken due to this.

See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.support/34446

The updated upstream tarball is here:
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap_packages-4.7.4.20140531.tar.bz2

NB: we do not attempt to make sure that the full functionality (interaction with an online database via http, which needs either another GAP package, IO, or `wget`) of `AtlasRep` is available (it appears to work OK on Linux, but only partially on OSX which does nto have `wget` installed). This is for another ticket.

download the tarball to `$SAGEROOT/upstream` and then run sage -f gap_packages

it will work then.

Replying to [dimpase](#comment%3A10):

this addresses both the branch mess (sorry, my fault!) and the tarball naming.

I also checked that `AtlasRep` works just fine on OSX if one installs `wget` (to some global place like `/usr/local/bin`).
[`wget`](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.14.tar.gz) builds just fine on OSX 10.9.3 if configured with 

```
./configure --with-ssl=openssl
```

No its not, basing your branch on the wrong starting point is just as much of a problem as diffing your patch relative to the wrong base. Its only easier to detect and fix with git since the history is recorded and can be edited if necessary.

Thanks. I changed the ticket description only after shooting off the question in comment 15, realising the nature of your complaint... 

Regarding the problem to install an spkg from a specific URL - is it a bug or a feature?

It's `OS X`, not `OSX`.  For what it's worth, curl is standard on OS X instead of wget and can do the same thing (though with very different commands).   This is probably due to licensing, as wget is GPL'd and curl is MIT licensed.   Apple tries very hard to avoid shipping GPL'd software.
