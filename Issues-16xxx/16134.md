An implementation of modular forms for Hecke triangle groups.

See the README file for more details.

This is my first contribution to sage, so I'm not familiar yet with
all aspects/conventions. E.g. some function/class names should probably be changed.

I used an unfinnished/stub implementation for the Hecke triangle group.
This is probably not a big issue since it is mostly used as a simple container for data anyway.

I ran into some issues with sage components which forced me to
use "less elegant" solutions (that still "work" though).
Especially with the pushout construction of sage,
I think there are some problems with it.
