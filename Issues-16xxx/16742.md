The target of this ticket is to enhance the function weak_popov of the matrix interface.  The function should transform the matrix in weak popov form, it will use mulders-storjohann algorithm and should be much faster than the current implementation but will not work for polynomials over a fraction field only for polynomial rings over finite fields.

This ticket is independent from but connected to #16739.

Short description of weak popov form: Let R be an ordered Ring and Amxn a matrix over R. The leading position of a row is called the position i in [1,m) such that the order of A[i,_] is maximal within the row. If there are multiple entries with the maximum order, the highest i is the leading position (the furthest to the right in the matrix). A is in weak popov form if all leading positions are different (zero lines ignored).

The function will implement this only for polynomial rings, the order function is the degree of the polynomial. Example:

[x2+1, x]

[x, x+1]

is in weak popov form: Row 1 has the degrees 2 and 1, the leading position is for i=0, row 2 has two times degree 1 so the higher i is chosen with i=1.

[x2+1, x]

[x,0]

is NOT in weak popov form, row 1 has now degrees 1 and -1, so the leading position is i=0 as in row 1.

```json
{
    "body": "<div id=\"comment:19\" align=\"right\">comment:19</div>\n\nHello,\n\nI'm working on the review for tickets related to the weal Popov form problem. Even if this one was not on `needs_review` state, I considered that it was quite old, and did not change for a while, so I took the liberty to review it.\n\n## General comments\n\ng1) Several conflicts arise if merge with latest Sage beta. They need to be fixed.\n\ng2) There are some trailing whitespaces in the files you modified. It will be nice to remove them.\n\ng3) There are errors while building the documentation. To check if the documentation builds as it should, and check if the html output looks good or not, you can use `sage --docbuild reference/myFolder html`, replacing my folder by the part of Sage you were working on. Here, it will be `reference/matrices`.\n\n## Documentation-related comments\n\nd1) While writing documentation, you can use double backticks to have a nice formatting for variables. If you use simple backticks, it will format it as LaTeX test, which will just be italic if used on simple text. It is advised in [Sage documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) to use double backticks around variables in the output block. Besides, it looks better for variables, or Python-related keyworkds (like `True`, or `None`) to use this syntax.\n\nd2) The title of the file `weak_popov.pyx` is splitted on the html documentation. Write the title in one line, or use an underscore to avoid this.\n\nd3) After the merge with latest beta, especially with the content of #16888, doctests of `weak_popov.pyx` are broken as `weak_popov_form` method throws a deprecation warning.\n\nd4) I think it's better to call directly the method you're doctesting. In `mulders_storjohann`'s doctests, call `mulders_storjohann` instead of `weak_popov`.\n\nd5) On line 152 (examples for `mulders_storjohann`) in `weak_popov`, you say \"Generally matrices in weak popov form will just be returned\". I think they will always be returned. In that case, can you remove \"generally\"? If I'm wrong, can you add an example in which we input a matrix in wPf which is not returned as is?\n\nd6) You can get a nice formatting on the `ALGORITHM` block (`weak_popov.py:102`) if you use only one colon instead of two after the `ALGORITHM` keyword.\n\nd7) On both helper methods you wrote in `weak_popov.pyx`, you have this block:\n\n```\n  .. note::\n    \n        This method is used in the mulders-storjohann algorithm.\n```\n\nI think it will be more explicit for the user to say something like \"This is a helper function for Mulders-Storjohann algorithm and should only be used internally\".\n\nd8) At the beginning of each function, you write something like \"Function to do something\". You can go straight to the point, and write directly \"Returns this\" or \"Computes that\".\n\nd9) In `simmple_transformation`'s doc, input parameter `U` is not documented.\n\n## Code and design related comments\n\nc1) `mulders-storjohann` method takes a matrix `M` as an input, then modifies it in place, and outputs the modified matrix. I think it's not an intuitive behaviour.

Hello,

I'm working on the review for tickets related to the weal Popov form problem. Even if this one was not on `needs_review` state, I considered that it was quite old, and did not change for a while, so I took the liberty to review it.

## General comments

g1) Several conflicts arise if merge with latest Sage beta. They need to be fixed.

g2) There are some trailing whitespaces in the files you modified. It will be nice to remove them.

g3) There are errors while building the documentation. To check if the documentation builds as it should, and check if the html output looks good or not, you can use `sage --docbuild reference/myFolder html`, replacing my folder by the part of Sage you were working on. Here, it will be `reference/matrices`.

## Documentation-related comments

d1) While writing documentation, you can use double backticks to have a nice formatting for variables. If you use simple backticks, it will format it as LaTeX test, which will just be italic if used on simple text. It is advised in [Sage documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) to use double backticks around variables in the output block. Besides, it looks better for variables, or Python-related keyworkds (like `True`, or `None`) to use this syntax.

d2) The title of the file `weak_popov.pyx` is splitted on the html documentation. Write the title in one line, or use an underscore to avoid this.

d3) After the merge with latest beta, especially with the content of #16888, doctests of `weak_popov.pyx` are broken as `weak_popov_form` method throws a deprecation warning.

d4) I think it's better to call directly the method you're doctesting. In `mulders_storjohann`'s doctests, call `mulders_storjohann` instead of `weak_popov`.

d5) On line 152 (examples for `mulders_storjohann`) in `weak_popov`, you say "Generally matrices in weak popov form will just be returned". I think they will always be returned. In that case, can you remove "generally"? If I'm wrong, can you add an example in which we input a matrix in wPf which is not returned as is?

d6) You can get a nice formatting on the `ALGORITHM` block (`weak_popov.py:102`) if you use only one colon instead of two after the `ALGORITHM` keyword.

d7) On both helper methods you wrote in `weak_popov.pyx`, you have this block:

```
  .. note::
    
        This method is used in the mulders-storjohann algorithm.
```

I think it will be more explicit for the user to say something like "This is a helper function for Mulders-Storjohann algorithm and should only be used internally".

d8) At the beginning of each function, you write something like "Function to do something". You can go straight to the point, and write directly "Returns this" or "Computes that".

d9) In `simmple_transformation`'s doc, input parameter `U` is not documented.

## Code and design related comments

c1) `mulders-storjohann` method takes a matrix `M` as an input, then modifies it in place, and outputs the modified matrix. I think it's not an intuitive behaviour. It should either modify the input in place, and output nothing or copy the input and output the modified copy.

c2) With the merge of #16888, old `weak_popov_form` method will be deprecated and renamed `row_reduced_form`. Which means that, without any changes, one will need to call `M.row_reduced_form(implementation="cython")` to get the weak Popov form of `M`... Which is not intuitive at all. What I suggest here is to reinstate the method `weak_popov_form` (as it will compute the wPf, we can de-deprecate it) which will do the transformations to get the wPf of the input using `mulders-storjohann` method. By doing that, we keep the `row_reduced_form` method for users who absolutely want the row reduced form of their matrices, and have a real weak Popov form computation with methods explicitely named.

c3) As #16896 changes the calling conventions of `row_reduced_from`, I think one the two tickets should depend on the other one to be sure we get what we want in the end, namely a wPf method and a rrf method with simplfied calling conventions.
