Yes this seems clear.
 
But how about lines like:

```
Construction 1	two_n()	Returns a Steiner Quadruple System on 2n points
```
I'd say, make it either  `Return`, or `returns`.

```
[Hanani60]	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Haim Hanani, On quadruple systems...

is how it should be. (Actually, indeed, there are 5 occurences of [Hanani60]_ in the text, but why this should be typeset like this by Sphinx, I have no idea.
If this can be fixed (in another ticket), it should.
