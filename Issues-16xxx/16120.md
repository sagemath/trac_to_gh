There is currently no `__float__` method for the class Universal Cyclotomic Field. For example:

```
    sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
    sage: float(E(5)+E(5)^(-1))
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-2-0d63f957cb28> in <module>()
    ----> 1 float(E(Integer(5))+E(Integer(5))**(-Integer(1)))

    TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
    
    sage: float(CDF(E(5)+E(5)^(-1)).real_part())
    0.6180339887498949

```

We would like something such as:

```

    sage: float(E(5)+E(5)^(-1))
    0.6180339887498949

```  
This ticket is a prerequisite to #15703.

The ComplexLazyField gives you as much precision as you want, while the ComplexDoubleField is restricted

```
sage: a = CLF(e)
sage: b = CDF(e)
sage: a
2.718281828459046?
sage: b
2.71828182846

But `__float__` is supposed to return a Python float, so you don't need the extra precision...

Vivien: wouldn't a `ValueError` be more appropriate in the case where the element you want to convert is not real?

I have corrected the doctest, that was failing. And also changed to ValueError

And also used python3 syntax

This looks good to me. If nobody else disagrees, and my changes are ok, you can set to positive review.

Hence `float(CDF(self).real_part())`\nlooks like a post-processing of an error somewhere. But i do not see any\nreason why the rounding of the real part will be better.\n\nAs your number is already real, i would prefer to do `float(AA(e))`: here the\n\"real part projection\" is done on the exact side (and the method `real_exact`\nof `AA` will be called only once). It is however between two and three times\nslower.\n\nWhat do you think about this ?\n\nBy the way, it could be nice to be able to have `RR(e)`, `RIF(e)` and `CIF(e)`\nwork as well.\n\n\nThat said:\n\n```\nsage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()\nsage: e = 3/2*E(7) + E(7)^3 + E(7)^4 + 3/2*E(7)^6\nsage: float(e) == float(AA(e))\nFalse\nsage: float(e) < float(AA(e))\nTrue\nsage: RIF = RealIntervalField(100)\nsage: RIF(float(e)).endpoints()[0] < RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[0] < RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1] < RIF(float(AA(e))).endpoints()[0]\nTrue\nsage: RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1] - RIF(float(e)).endpoints()[0]\n5.9704982077798935821915405952e-19\nsage: RIF(float(AA(e))).endpoints()[0] - RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1]\n1.3280737987036467397076241791e-17\n```\n\nMeaning that `e` is closer to `float(e)` than `float(AA(e))` which are both\nfloating point numbers of the same precision, and the default rounding mode is\ndone \"to the nearest\".

I was working on this review but you are all too fast for me :)

I have some issues with testing this method.

```
sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: e = 3/2*E(7) + E(7)^3 + E(7)^4 + 3/2*E(7)^6
sage: e.is_real()
True
sage: CDF(e)
0.0685316697714 + 1.62630325873e-19*I
```

Meaning that somewhere the rounding is not correct (at least for the imaginary
part) with the computation of `CDF(e)`. Hence `float(CDF(self).real_part())`
looks like a post-processing of an error somewhere. But i do not see any
reason why the rounding of the real part will be better.

As your number is already real, i would prefer to do `float(AA(e))`: here the
"real part projection" is done on the exact side (and the method `real_exact`
of `AA` will be called only once). It is however between two and three times
slower.

What do you think about this ?

By the way, it could be nice to be able to have `RR(e)`, `RIF(e)` and `CIF(e)`
work as well.


That said:

```
sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: e = 3/2*E(7) + E(7)^3 + E(7)^4 + 3/2*E(7)^6
sage: float(e) == float(AA(e))
False
sage: float(e) < float(AA(e))
True
sage: RIF = RealIntervalField(100)
sage: RIF(float(e)).endpoints()[0] < RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[0] < RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1] < RIF(float(AA(e))).endpoints()[0]
True
sage: RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1] - RIF(float(e)).endpoints()[0]
5.9704982077798935821915405952e-19
sage: RIF(float(AA(e))).endpoints()[0] - RIF(AA(e)).endpoints()[1]
1.3280737987036467397076241791e-17
```

Meaning that `e` is closer to `float(e)` than `float(AA(e))` which are both
floating point numbers of the same precision, and the default rounding mode is
done "to the nearest". The conversion from `AA` to `RR` (hence to `float`) is
assuming to respect the rounding mode, since the doc explicitely claims to
respect the rounding mode. This has to be explored, though it is not part of
this ticket.

I prefer the current version, because, as far as I understand, the test that `e` is real implied by `AA(e)` (`AA._element_constructor_` testing that the imaginary part of `QQbar(e)` is zero)  can be much more expensive than `e.is_real()`. And I don't really see the point of computing an exact representation of the real part if what we want in the end is an approximation.eans that

Sure. But not necessarily as part of this ticket.

From `AA` to `RR`, yes, but why "hence to `float`"?

That being said, I agree that the conversion from `AA` to `RR` does not seem to round to nearest:

```
sage: a = AA(e); r = RR(a)
sage: r.exact_rational() - a
1.328?e-17
sage: r.nextbelow().exact_rational() - a
-6.0?e-19
```

Of course, this was only a suggestion for a further work on universal cyclotomic field.

Because the method `__float__` of `AA` is just `return float(RR(self))`.
