This ticket implements polyhedra over every exact subfield of the reals in Sage:

```
    sage: triangle = Polyhedron([(0,0), (1,0), (1/2, sqrt(3)/2)], base_ring=AA)
    sage: triangle.Hrepresentation()
    (An inequality (-1, -0.5773502691896258?) x + 1 >= 0, 
     An inequality (1, -0.5773502691896258?) x + 0 >= 0, 
     An inequality (0, 1.154700538379252?) x + 0 >= 0)

I've rebased the branch and made a few very minor changes (almost all formatting). I'd like to review the patch, but since
- there's still a `DEBUG=True`
- I don't know much about polyhedra
that's probably not the best idea. The code looks good though.

For this ticket any serious examples/tests are lacking; that's why it would be great to have something substantially bigger than a triangle.

I don't think that 600-cell is a big example; it is a 4-dimensional polytope with 120 vertices!
If about the only example the new codepath is checked on is a plane triangle, then I say no, this needs work...

Would you like me to construct this test?

absence of a sizeable example with irrational numbers suggests that there could be memory leaks which only manifest themselves on such an example; you might make the example a bit smaller by only taking the 96 vertices with irrational coordinates, constructing the [snub 24-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_24-cell).

Its still worth less than nothing to go around and try to hold up tickets until Frederic Chapoton gets around to detect and fix trailing whitespace. At a rate of about one a day we'll have finally tackled the evils of trailing whitespace in just about 5 years. Seriously, we'll never possibly lose as much developer time over the tiny annoyance of [End] moving you past the last non-whitespace character of the line. If you care about this then you need to develop a process, anything else is just bullshit.

In any case, I'm still waiting for a review.
