This ticket implements polyhedra over every exact subfield of the reals in Sage:

```
    sage: triangle = Polyhedron([(0,0), (1,0), (1/2, sqrt(3)/2)], base_ring=AA)
    sage: triangle.Hrepresentation()
    (An inequality (-1, -0.5773502691896258?) x + 1 >= 0, 
     An inequality (1, -0.5773502691896258?) x + 0 >= 0, 
     An inequality (0, 1.154700538379252?) x + 0 >= 0)
```

I've rebased the branch and made a few very minor changes (almost all formatting). I'd like to review the patch, but since
- there's still a `DEBUG=True`
- I don't know much about polyhedra
that's probably not the best idea. The code looks good though.

I don't think that 600-cell is a big example; it is a 4-dimensional polytope with 120 vertices!
If about the only example the new codepath is checked on is a plane triangle, then I say no, this needs work...

Would you like me to construct this test?

absence of a sizeable example with irrational numbers suggests that there could be memory leaks which only manifest themselves on such an example; you might make the example a bit smaller by only taking the 96 vertices with irrational coordinates, constructing the [snub 24-cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_24-cell).

How about "this is the world's fastest code for polyhedra over degree > 2 extensions". Because, as far as I know, there is nothing else. IMHO it does work great.

Also, nothing in the computation really knows about whether a number is rational or not. There might be memory leaks, or really all kinds of bugs, in the underlying field implementation.
