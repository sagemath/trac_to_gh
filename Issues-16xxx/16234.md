```
- Improve documentation of promotion operators (there are three of them in Sage) on SSYTs.

- Add doc to Lascoux-Sch√ºtzenberger action on tableaux.

- Add a few more `@`combinatorial_map decorators on tableaux, partitions, posets.

- Fix doc of the Greene-Kleitman partition method on finite posets.

- Speed up `is_column_strict` and three further methods on tableaux. PSA: don't use `copy.deepcopy` unless you really don't know the internal structure of the objects you are copying.

- Fix a bug in the iterator of `Partitions(..., outer=a)` that caused `a` to be mutated occasionally, and that required `a` to be a list (as opposed to, more reasonably, a partition or tuple):

```
sage: a = [4,2,1,1,1,1,1]
sage: for p in Partitions(8, outer=a, min_slope=-1):
    print p
....:     
[3, 2, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sage: a
[3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

Hi Darij, thank you very much for this work!


There is something wrong with the documentation of `symmetric_group_action_on_values`. I must say that I didn't know this operation, so I don't know its definition. But from the code, it seems that your documentation doesn't quite correspond to what is done in the code. When you write this:


```
        Then, let `a` be the number of opening
        parentheses in the word, and `b` the number of closing
        parentheses (notice that all opening parentheses are left of
        all closing parentheses). Replace the first `b` parentheses
        by the letters `i+1`, and replace the remaining `a` parentheses
        by the letters `i`.
```


Indeed, the action of `s_1` on `[This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)` should give `[This is the Trac macro *2,1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#2,1-macro)` which is not a semi-standard tableau... (you obtain the unmatched parenthesizes `)(`).  The code answers `[This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro)`, I must say that it is quite obscure and I don't understand what they're doing. But obviously, the documentation does not explain it correctly. Do you have the paper reference where this operation is described? 

Apart from that, it seems good to me.
