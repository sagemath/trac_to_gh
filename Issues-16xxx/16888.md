While working on the sage.matrix.matrix2.weak_popov_form (for sage.matrix.matrix_misc.weak_popov_form applies the same) method for performance issues I noticed something.

The weak Popov form as defined in [MS] is not computed by this method. The other references do not call this form weak Popov form, it is a les restrictive definition for a certain row reduced form of matrix.

Followup ticket for reimplementation of wpf: #16742 and #16896.

Comment of weak_popov_form:

  OUTPUT:
  
          A 3-tuple !`(W,N,d)`   consisting of:
  
1. !`W`   - a matrix over !`k(x)`   giving a weak the Popov form of self
2. !`N`   - a matrix over !`k[x]`   representing row operations used to
    transform !`self`   to !`W`  
3. !`d`   - degree of respective columns of W; the degree of a column is
   the maximum of the degree of its elements

-1. It takes a parameter ascend but does not relay it to the function (it is entirely ignored)
-2. It takes a parameter ascend which is not related to either weak Popov form or row reduced form
-3. It returns a 3-touple even though it is only expected to compute the wpf/rrf
-4. d of the 3-touple and the sorting is unnecessary computation and should probably not be part of the method.
-5. while N is nice to check some things, in my opinion it should only be given if asked for
