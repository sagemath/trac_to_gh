Installs fine and Sage still runs.
I checked Volker's tarball is the same as the upstream one from https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/i/ipython/ipython-2.2.0.tar.gz#md5=b91d3724f655a8e16d022772f696cfd5

I'm running tests now, but there is no reason to expect failures (and the patchbots will test it as well).
