The `lazy_list` in `sage.misc.lazy_list` only deals with infinite list built from iterator. 
In many situations we want to create infinite list from more various data: 
- **an iterator** (current implementation),
- **an explicit form** a function n -> n-th term
- **an update function**: a function that given a buffer of already computed values compute some extra terms (e.g. in the context of words: fixed point of substitutions and in the context of power series: Newton iteration and relaxed multiplication).

Those new lazy lists aim to be very basic Python objects. Their purpose is to be used as fast and reliable data structures in: 
- words (`sage.combinat.words`, see also #19620) 
- continued fraction expansions/binary expansions of real numbers 
- lazy power series (see #15673) 
- ... 

See also: rational o.g.f. #15714, hypergeometric e.g.f. part of #2516

In the original proposal there was also ultimately periodic lazy lists (that would simply store two attributes for the pre-period and period). In this ticket we focus on the ones that need a cache mechanism.

Hi Ralf,

I think that our third item also includes CFinite sequences. The difference is about how the function `update` is written. It might be either

```
def update1(cache):
    cache.append(cache[-1] + cache[-2])
```
or

```
def update2(cache):
    return cache[-1]+cache[-2]
```
Actually, even a closed form is a special case of `update1` as one can call `len` on the cache. Do you agree or did I miss something?

The main task of this ticket is to write precise specifications of what we need... adapting the current implementation of `lazy_list` is straightforward.

Hey Martin,

There is no way `lazy_list` would be made only of numbers! My first goal was to have better data structure for words (`sage.combinat.words`). I also had in mind its usage in lazy power series. Do you prefer the new description? Please edit it if there is something wrong. The concrete implementation did not start yet. We are waiting for the best possible specifications...

Ralf,

I do not understand what happened and if you did it on purpose. I modified the description twice and you reverted my changes twice !! It is very annoying.

Hi there !

I propose a draft of code for 'lazy_list_from_iterator' and 'lazy_list_from_fun'.
Currently, the file is composed of three class : one abstract class (but I don't know how to precise this more formally in Python / Cython / Sage) to facorize the code between lazy_list_from_iterator and lazy_list_from_fun.

I have to do choices :
- to define lazy list with function I propose to use a fonction which takes 2 arguments : the rank of the element to compute and all the already computed elements
- Currently, the `_add_` method force the computation of all the elements : that's very annoying for not finite iterator. I suppressed it, for the moment.

Give me feedback !

Thanks

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:23\" align=\"right\">comment:23</div>\n\nComments (IMPORTANT: I have hardly any understanding of python/cython necessities, so some of these may be very naive or stupid)\n\n1.) Concerning the *original* `lazy_list`, I would have expected that\n\n\n```\nsage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list\nsage: l = lazy_list(Primes())\nsage: l[:100]\n```\n\nreturns a list, not a lazy list.  (I'm aware of `l[:100].list()`, but this seems inconsistent: `l[0]` also returns an element, not a lazy list)\n\nDo you know a reason for this decision?  Possibly it's more practical, right?\n\n2.) Concerning the *new* `lazy_list` some things clearly don't work:\n\n```\nsage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list_from_iterator\nsage: from itertools import count\nsage: l2 = lazy_list_from_iterator(count()); l2\nlazy list [0, 1, 2, ...]\nsage: l2[:10]\n(0, 10, 1)\nsage: l2[10]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-8-02ea92939ca1> in <module>()\n----> 1 l2[Integer(10)]\n\n/home/rubey/sage-lazy_list/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/lazy_list.so in sage.misc.lazy_list.lazy_list_from_iterator.__getitem__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/lazy_list.c:6074)()\n\nTypeError: 'int' object is not iterable\n```\n\n3.) Yes, I think that `lazy_list_from_fun` (besides: I would prefer `lazy_list_from_function`) should do precisely as you say.

Comments (IMPORTANT: I have hardly any understanding of python/cython necessities, so some of these may be very naive or stupid)

1.) Concerning the *original* `lazy_list`, I would have expected that


```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list
sage: l = lazy_list(Primes())
sage: l[:100]
```

returns a list, not a lazy list.  (I'm aware of `l[:100].list()`, but this seems inconsistent: `l[0]` also returns an element, not a lazy list)

Do you know a reason for this decision?  Possibly it's more practical, right?

2.) Concerning the *new* `lazy_list` some things clearly don't work:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import lazy_list_from_iterator
sage: from itertools import count
sage: l2 = lazy_list_from_iterator(count()); l2
lazy list [0, 1, 2, ...]
sage: l2[:10]
(0, 10, 1)
sage: l2[10]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-8-02ea92939ca1> in <module>()
----> 1 l2[Integer(10)]

/home/rubey/sage-lazy_list/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/lazy_list.so in sage.misc.lazy_list.lazy_list_from_iterator.__getitem__ (build/cythonized/sage/misc/lazy_list.c:6074)()

TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

3.) Yes, I think that `lazy_list_from_fun` (besides: I would prefer `lazy_list_from_function`) should do precisely as you say.  Currently, it doesn't: I would have expected the following to return
a lazy list full of empty lists...

```
sage: l3 = lazy_list_from_fun(lambda a, b: b); l3
lazy list [[[...], [...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...], [...]], [[...], [...], [...], [...]], ...]
```

4.) There are now two entry points: `lazy_list_from_fun` and `lazy_list_from_iterator`.  I would expect that in the end there is also a general purpose constructor which decides what to use
depending on the type of the argument, right?

Hello,

Cool. Thanks Matthieu!

1) Please use complete names `lazy_list_from_function` and not abreviations. (see also item 3 of Martin)

2) For your specifications, I really do not think it is the best way to do. Very often you have functions that update *many* values at a time (think about Newton method, or substitutively defined sequences). I would prefer much more `lazy_list_from_function` whose argument would be a function `f(computed_values)` and which would update the list `computed_values` with one iteration of the algorithm (and return nothing or possibly an error code). And it has no sense to send the size of the cache to that function (since it is a list and a list knows its length).

3) I think we need more classes (I am not convinced by all names). Some of them might be implemented in further tickets

```
lazy_list: abstract class
 |
 +-- lazy_list_periodic: ultimately periodic lazy list (attributes=two lists)
 |
 +-- lazy_list_explicit: (attribute=function n-> u_n)
 |
 +-- lazy_list_concatenation: a concatenation of a finite liste and a lazy list
 |
 +-- lazy_list_slice: a slice of another lazy list
 |
 +-- lazy_list_with_cache: a cache management
      |
      +-- lazy_list_from_iterator: the old lazy_list
      |
      +-- lazy_list_from_function: update function (basically what you did)
```

4) we need a unique entry point for all these classes which must be of course `lazy_list`.

5) In the old implementation `lazy_list` were immutable. It has the advantage of having shared slices. On the other hand it is annoying because they are immutable and hence it will be forbidden to have operations like "f += 1" without a (light) copy.

Vincent

I think we should try to avoid redundancy.  I guess, redundancy will be obvious once coded...

However, I also thought that something like `lazy_list_explicit` would be very useful.  I'm not sure: is turning on caching for a function in python easy enough so that a cached variant of this would not make sense?

At least for the applications I have in mind, I think immutability is fine.  For example, we will have lazy formal power series, and I certainly do not want to make assignments to those possible.  (Think of students who prove to me that `exp(z)` equals 2 :-)

yes, but right now only in Sage:

```
sage: f = lambda n: n*(n+1)/2
sage: f_cached = cached_function(f)
sage: f_cached(10)
55
sage: f_cached.get_cache()
{((10,), ()): 55}
```

Hi there,

I just checked that, in a very rudimentary way, we can define lazy lists recursively, as follows:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_list import *
sage: from itertools import *
sage: l = lazy_list_recursive(cache = [[]])
sage: l.define(imap(lambda a: [1] + a, l))
sage: l[0], l[1], l[2]
([], [1], [1, 1])
```

I also had to realise that `itertools.product` is not particularly intelligent what concerns infinite streams...

I'll take a break now and wait for feedback.  In summary, it now seems to me that we want `lazy_list`
to be

* a model for "infinite lists", i.e., support slicing
* play as well as possible with iterators
* provide functionality that `itertools` cannot provide: 
    * `next` depending on the previous values
    * possibly recursive definitions
    * what else?
* what else?

In particular, should `lazy_list` additionally provide wrappers for the functionality in `itertools`?  Currently, I don't think so.

Hi there,

I found the bug that avoid me to connect on Sage trac (I used my phone's connection).
So, I copy the message which I sent by email.

@mantepse
The diference bewteen lazy_list and iterator is not only the caching.
There is also the way to compute an element : if you want the nth element of an iterator you have to compute the (n-1) previous ones, for lazy_list (currently the implementation does not do this but it should in close future) the goal is to compute elements only if it obligatory.
For example, you don't want to compute all the coeffcients of a serie if at the end, you will only use the odd (or even) part.
Concerning recursive definition, we have to allow it but the implementation must not be recursive because recursion is extremly expensive in Python.

`@`Vincent
To implement this, I need to overload the `_fit` method and pass it in "`cdef` mode". I just have a question : why, in the iterator's class, do you use `update_cache_up_to` and not `_fit` ?

And finally, to answer to Martin about "what is `_normalize_slice` ?", `_normalize_slice` means nothing it is just a piece of code that I wanted to factorize. In fact I should factorize directly `__getitem__` by adding a method which have to create a slice (last line of code `__getitem__`).

Excellent point!

You made me think again about the name - I don't particularly like
"lazy_list".  Of course, from a math point of view I'd call it
"Sequence".  However, I just discovered that this is already taken in
Sage for something related, although not identical.

I then discovered "Family", which seems the same but a bit more general.
In fact, "lazy_list" is a Family having index set natural numbers.

Shouldn't we merge these two concepts, at least in the long run?

> Concerning recursive definition, we have to allow it but the

I'm not quite sure what you mean.  There is hardly any implementation.
I want that definitions like s = f(s), where "s" is a "lazy list"
determined by this equation, can be easily typed into sage.

Thus, I think of it as a convenience feature, for rapid prototyping.
Its usefulness lies in the fact that it's very general.  Thus, from the
user's perspective, I wouldn't expect it to do any fancy term-rewriting.

> And finally, to answer to Martin about "what is `_normalize_slice` ?

OK, thanks!

Best,

Martin

Replying to [@mantepse](#comment:47):
> Should we ask about the desired relationship between `Family`, `Sequence` and `lazy_list` on sage-devel?

There is already a ticket for that [ticket:16107 #16107] but we can ask on sage-devel for more feedback.

Concerning `Family`, I read documentation and code. That seems cool but not the same goal that `lazy_list`, especially concerning the definitions of such objects (`Family` can only be defined by iterable objects).

Thanks for pointing out #16107, I added the `LazyPowerSeries` keyword there!

I don't understand your assessment of `Family` though, why should it have a different goal?  At the very least, `lazy_list` should inherit from `Family`, no?

Hi there,

I implemented almost everyting. I still have to :
- make the factory
- do some factorizations of code
- document and test the code

I think that is the moment to ask you to try this implementation and tell me if there are any problems with the implementations or the design choices.

Best

Matthieu

Hi Matthieu!

I watched you work :-)  THANK YOU!!!

Right now I have only two comments:

1.)  I think the naming scheme for the classes should be changed:

a) `from_iterator` is fine
b) `from_function` is misleading.  In fact, in analogy to a) I would expect this class to do precisely what `explicit` does.  Isn't it precisely `recursive`?
c) `explicit` should in my opinion be named `from_function`
d) `periodic` is fine

I also would suggest to change `stopped` to `terminating` or `finite`.

2.) I still don't understand the relationship with `Family`.  I guess it's fine not to consider `Sequence` right now, but I think the relationship with `Family` should be clarified.  As a concrete question: should `Family` use `lazy_list` for sequences?

Hi Matthieu,

It would be nice to write documentation in the classes, particularly
- what is the input
- how does it work internally
It would help me to read your code.

Do you really want to keep the ``start, stop, step`` for all classes? I would rather add a class `lazy_list_slice` which does the job.

I do not understand anything to `lazy_list_explicit`. Why do you use a cache mechanism for it? Moreover, the following

```
cdef int update_cache_up_to(self, Py_ssize_t i) except -1:
    while PyList_GET_SIZE(self.cache) <= i:
        PyList_Append(self.cache, None)
```
is definitely useless since you can use the `self.cache.extend([None]*length)` which would be much faster.

Are you sure you understand the point of `Py_INCREF(object)`? If you call it when you should not, it implies that the object will *never* be garbage collected. The call to this function is generally not needed in Cython file.

Now Cython supports iterator, i.e. you can write

```
cdef class MyClass(X):
    def __iter__(self):
        cdef Py_ssize_t i
        for i in range(self.x,self.y,self.z):
            yield self.cache[i]
```
So I would remove all iterators "XYZ_iterator" and implement directly the methods `__iter__` when possible.

If you add the line

```
include "sage/ext/stdsage.pxi"
```
at the begining of the file you have access to better then "isinstance" to test the type of an object

```
PY_TYPE_CHECK(object)
PY_TYPE_CHECK_EXACT(object)
```

I have much more comments. I could also edit directly the file.

Vincent

Hi there,

Thanks you very much for the answers.
I will try to justify some of my choices and answer to some of your new questions.

Yes, I have to do this

I agree.

Thanks for the hint, I did not know `extend`.
Concerning the usage of a cache mechanism for `lazy_list_explicit`, it is because the computation of a list's cell can be long (for example when you compute the Cauchy's product during a lazy series' multiplication). Then, the cache mechanism allows to compute only one time the value contained in a cell.

> Are you sure you understand the point of `Py_INCREF(object)`? If you call it when you should not, it implies that the object will *never* be garbage collected. The call to this function is generally not needed in Cython file.

For this point, I have to check that the value is garbage collected, but without this instruction, the value is garbage collected instantly.

Ok, I did not know this. I will benchmark the both approaches.

`from_function` is recursive yes. Do you have an idea about the name (I am really bad to choose name ..) ?
>c) explicit should in my opinion be named from_function

`finite` looks better to me, if Vincent agrees ?

>2.) I still don't understand the relationship with Family. I guess it's fine not to consider >Sequence right now, but I think the relationship with Family should be clarified. As a concrete >question: should Family use lazy_list for sequences?

I think that this question deserves a new ticket because it can involve modification of the code in an other part of Sage. We can work on it if you want.

Hi there,

I did some of the proposed changes :
- I removed the iterators and use 'yield' instead
- I changed is_instance by PY_TYPE_CHECK in the `__getitem__` method to be faster
- I removed the "info" method

Concerning "lazy_list_slice", I have changed my mind : I think it is not necessary because almost all the code managing (start, stop, step) are in the abstract class and the remaining code is dependant of the different class.

At the end, what do you think about my explanation of why lazy_list_explicit must have a cache ?

Matthieu

PS : Doctests will be coming ;)

Hello,

I don't know what Matthieu is currently doing. Note that I have a similar proposal for infinite words in #19620 (with branch whose tests pass). In that case the underlying data is not a list but a `char *` from C. Though, the idea is exactly the same. It would be nice to have the same conventions in both cases.

I can provide an implementation for this ticket based on the architecture #19620. We might see later on whether power series needs some raw C datatype as well. Are you willing to review Daniel?

You can now create lazy lists from iterator and functions. And it is dead simple to create a new class inheriting from `lazy_list_abstract` (there is an example in the documentation).

I made a couple of smaller/minor changes during review; need cross-review. Additionally the following should be addressed/discussed:

1. `_new_slice` and other private methods: `_new_slice_` (underscore at the end as well)?

2. description, INPUT/OUTPUT of `lazy_list` is missing

3. should `list(cache)` appear in the code so that the cache cannot be changed 8accidentally) from outside since only a reference of the list is passed? This would also allow e.g. tuples as well. Or is it meant that `cache` really specifies the cache itself and not only the cached elements. If so, can we make this clear in the doc somewhere (description of `lazy_list`)?

4. `_fit`, last example: looks incomplete

5. `__call__`: write oneline description

6. `update_cache_up_to` everwhere: describe return value

7. <code>:class:\`lazy_list\`</code> appears a couple of times, but `lazy_list` is not a class anymore

8. note-block in `lazy_list_from_iterator` description should (also) be in `lazy_list`

9. `cache` in INPUT-blocks: everywhere mention that this is a list (see also above)

10. `__reduce__`: oneline description missing

21. ticket-description "a pair of finite lists (pre-period, period)": remove from description and create separate ticket for this issue?

32. ticket-description "an update function": this was addressed here, but when I see this correctly with a different interface as in the original code. "a function that given a buffer..." we do not have that here. I am fine with it as it is, but IMHO the description of the ticket does not fit anymore. Should this be a separate ticket as well? Maybe also specifying the old branch there to not forget about it?

Moreover, I've did a partial cherry picking of part of the old code of this ticket: the two iterators are removed and a simple `yield` in `__iter__` now does the job. I adapted it so that it works. Please cross-review.

> Concerning 14., I would vote for `lazy_stream` or even just `stream`, because of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing).  There currently is a class `Stream` in the species code, which is really a relatively poor implementation of what the code in this ticket does, and I'm quite eager to replace it.

`stream` sounds good to me (from the definition of `stream` from your wiki link, it seems that they are lazy by default, so no need to put that into the name).

Lazy lists might implement a mutable/immutable protocol in the future. In which case the reference to the Python data structure would be appropriate. And it is better to not change the name twice.

Stream is a technical computer term mostly used for communications. As it is said on wikipedia this notion is related to time: it is a "flux of information". It has the relevant menaing in the language Scheme (which is as far as I know, marginally used among mathematicians). I strongly disaprove its usage here.

Other name like `lazy_sequence` are already too mathematical.

Unless you have a strong need (and arguments) to change the name I am opposed to it.

I really don't care. But I do not see why it should be with 2 underscores. For me the double underscore methods are saying "I want to interact with the rest of Sage and cares about coercions". Like `_add_`, `_cmp_` etc. But it might be a personal feeling.

done.

Or is it meant that `cache` really specifies the cache itself and not only the cached elements. If so, can we make this clear in the doc somewhere (description of `lazy_list`)?

This is a feature you might actually want to use. In the constructors `__init__` method we clearly want to use the reference to the same list (I made it clear in the doc). In the factory `lazy_list` I am in favour of copying and adapted the code accordingly.

Actually not... I had some non trivial error. This method is subtle as for finite `lazy_list` you want to avoid the `StopIteration`branch. Though I added a `_info()`.

Actually you could do it by inheritance and implementing `_new_slice`. There you have access to the cache with the method `get`. See the Thue-Morse example.

Ok, then let's keep them as they are.

Since it is already there now, I would keep it. However, I won't need this feature (at this point), so I don't mind if it is removed.

Ok, thank you.

15. `lazy_list_abstract` vs. for example `lazy_list_generic`: I find it a bit strange to instantiate something with "abstract" in its name.

26. `beginning` vs. `inital_values`: I have a slight (but not strong) preference for the latter.

I've also made some minor changes; please cross-review.

That is a good design question. I have two reasons:
- avoid implementing twice `__getitem__` and `get`
- (not supported at the moment) the user might want to inherit from `lazy_list_generic` in such way that slices are also instances of the inherited object. In that case we could not make it a distinct class.

Yes, today I started to recollect what I want to do.  I'm not sure whether there is any need for another object "stream".  Rather, I think that the next step is a good lazy power series implementation.

The main complication is that it is useful to define power series recursively, as in

```
sage: sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: one = L(1)
sage: monom = L.gen()
sage: s = L()
sage: s._name = 's'
sage: s.define(one+monom*s*s)
sage: [s.coefficient(i) for i in range(6)]
[1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42]
```
In the current code, this is done by keeping track of the "approximate order" of the power series.  Note that there are no initial values provided by the user.

An earlier attempt was done by Mike Hansen in #15673, so I guess it's best to continue discussion there.  I also have code (for FriCAS, however) that generalizes this using a different approach, via undetermined coefficients and given initial values.

I guess that I am a terrible python programmer, but I think I can give it a try.  I would start with what Mike has written, but first I want to recollect how these recursive definitions worked.

I don't know about what the motivation of moving it was, but I disagree that it is *not* a data structure. `list` is a data structure for sure, so a variant of it, namely our lazy list, is it as well.
The wikipedia says on "data structure" in its first sentence:
    In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
That's what we have, haven't we?

Why do you think it is not a data structure?

Not really. I wouldn't call a lazy list "a way of organizing data".

It you think it is, then essentially everything in Sage is a data structure.
