Hi,

I implemented a much better version than my proposal in #16308 (linear complexity in the input for `two_squares_pyx`). It is not yet branched in `arith.py`, I will do this when #16308 is merged.

timings:

```
sage: from sage.rings.arith_pyx import four_squares_pyx
sage: timeit("for n in xrange(10000,50000): x = four_squares_pyx(n)")
5 loops, best of 3: 46 ms per loop
```

Best

Hello !

I added a commit in u/ncohen/16374 which contains some tests and comments.

I have two questions to ask though :

- Why `ii <= n/2` and not `ii<=jj` ?

- Why a "while" instead of a "if" in the following code ?

```
    j = (<unsigned int> sqrt(<double> n)) + 1 # (rounding is toward zero)
    while j*j > n:
        j -= 1
```

Besides, there is a way to avoid many multiplications, and **perhaps** it can improve the code a bit (no idea, profiling is the only way `:-P`)

```
sage: i = 5    
sage: ii = i**2
sage: i**2 == ii
True
sage: ii+=2*i+1
sage: i+=1
sage: i**2 == ii
True
```

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for reading it.

> I added a commit in u/ncohen/16374 which contains some tests and comments.


Great. I also have something important to modify in `three_squares_pyx` and `four_squares_pyx`. It is **much** faster to first remove a huge square and then try to decompose the rest into a sum of less squares. The result is not the smallest for lexicographical order but the timings are x4 better.

It seems that you like C function declaration of the form `int f(int res[3])`. It makes the specifications clearer but at compilation the results are strictly equivalent.

Right.

I am not sure of the specification (if any) of `sqrt` which deals with double... I will try to improve it.

> Besides, there is a way to avoid many multiplications, and **perhaps** it can improve the code a bit (no idea, profiling is the only way `:-P`)


I thought about it. I am not sure that `ii += 2*i + 1` is cheaper than `ii = i*i` ? Will have a look.

Hi,

I confirm that there is no difference between "ii = i*i" and "ii -= 2*i + 1". Anyway, I am pretty sure that this is the kind of optimization that gcc takes care of with the option "-O3". In the new commit there are the modifications relative to your comment and mine.

New timings

```
sage: from sage.rings.arith_pyx import four_squares_pyx
sage: timeit("for n in xrange(10000,50000): x = four_squares_pyx(n)")
25 loops, best of 3: 11.3 ms per loop
```

About the dependencies, I am not sure whether this ticket should go before or after #16308...

Sure, write the most readable code and let the compiler do its job.

Even better: make these two tickets independent and then make a third ticket to integrate them.

Hi,

The file is now `sum_of_squares.pyx`.

I changed the `unsigned int` to `unsigned long` as Jeroen suggested. The loss in terms of timing seems to be around 1% (see below). Nevertheless, the function makes no sense for very large input as it is much faster to called the Python function from `arith` (see also below).

For the rounding issue with `sqrt`, it uses now `<unsigned long> sqrt(<double> n)` and there is an exhaustive test in the doc of the function `two_squares_pyx`.

unsigned int

```
sage: from sage.rings.sum_of_squares import four_squares_pyx
sage: timeit("for n in xrange(10000,50000): x = four_squares_pyx(n)")
25 loops, best of 3: 11 ms per loop
```

unsigned long

```
sage: from sage.rings.sum_of_squares import four_squares_pyx
sage: timeit("for n in xrange(10000,50000): x = four_squares_pyx(n)")
25 loops, best of 3: 11.3 ms per loop
```

Very large input

```
sage: from sage.rings.sum_of_squares import two_squares_pyx
sage: %timeit two_squares_pyx(2**51+21)
10 loops, best of 3: 88.1 ms per loop
sage: %timeit two_squares(2**51+21)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.04 ms per loop
```

There are only two places were overflow may occur:
- the input
- when we rely on long double to perform the square root (i.e. are we sure that an `unsigned long` fits into a `long double` ?) 
All integers that appear inside the function are smaller than the input. So, no trouble here.

I think the `long double` is overkill and would revert to using `sqrt()`.

1. It decreases portability (`sqrtl()` is C99 so at least you need to compile in C99 mode and not all systems have this function).

2. You will never want to call `two_squares` in this range (`2^53`) anyway.

3. For `three_squares` and `four_squares`, there are many solutions, so it doesn't matter if the square root is off by 1.

:-)  Yes, C99 is only 15 years old.  (Note that a lot of code in Sage requires C99, and any recent GCC defaults to `-std=gnu99`.)

While there are (very few) platforms where the math library at least used to lack some long double functions, I really wouldn't care here.

By the way, IMHO `i` and `j` should be `unsigned` rather than `unsigned long`.  (And as mentioned, I'd rather use `uint32_t` and `uint64_t`, or even better, `uint_fast32_t` instead of the former.)

Note that in

```python
        j = <unsigned> sqrt[l](<[long] double> n)
        j += 1 - j%2
```
`j` still cannot overflow, since `sqrt[l]()` returns `UINT_MAX` (which is odd) for n close to `ULONG_MAX`.

However, I'd limit the input to values far below `ULONG_MAX` (more precisely, `UINT64_MAX`) anyway.





> 2. You will never want to call `two_squares` in this range (`2^53`) anyway.


Yes, and I'd actually bail out above some cutoff.




> 4. I have to check the details, but I think that `<unsigned long> sqrt(<double> n)` is actually sufficiently precise that it computes the exact integer square root.


? You mean `(unsigned long)sqrt((double)N) * (unsigned long)sqrt((double)N) <= N` (for all N < 2<sup>53</sup>, say), or `(unsigned long)sqrt((double)(N*N)) == N` (for all N < 2<sup>26</sup>, say)?




I'm ok with using `sqrt()` if we limit the input accordingly (to at most 2<sup>53</sup>-1).

Hi,

The file now uses `uint_fast32_t` and `sqrt`. There is a check on the input size of the three cython functions (since on some platform a `uint_fast32_t` is actually 64 bits). But I did not know how to test it properly... so it is `# not tested`.

Please review!
Vincent

I re-read this thing again and I think that it is good to go. I added a small commit in public/16374 to replace `2^32` with `2^{32}` which produced a bad output in the html doc.
