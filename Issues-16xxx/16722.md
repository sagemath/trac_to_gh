<a id='comment:5'></a>One simplication at `u/vdelecroix/16722` (the ordering of the finite field is lexicographic... hence the subfield that corresponds to elements of degree < beta are the first 2<sup>beta</sup> elements of the list).

Beyond that, it is fine... so you can set to positive review if you like my commit.
