The function `is_real` is useful but it is not practical because it it not implemented for every types of numbers in Sage. And I do not want to do type checking before being able to use it in my code.

```
sage: CC(3).is_real()
True
sage: RR(3).is_real()
True
sage: SR(3).is_real()
True
sage: ZZ(3).is_real()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'is_real'
sage: QQ(3).is_real()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.rational.Rational' object has no attribute 'is_real'
sage: AA(3).is_real()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicReal' object has no attribute 'is_real'
sage: AlgebraicNumber(3).is_real()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicNumber' object has no attribute 'is_real'

sage: RDF(3).is_real()
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement' object has no attribute 'is_real'

sage: QQbar(3).is_real()
AttributeError: 'AlgebraicNumber' object has no attribute 'is_real'

```

I am sure I forget some other rings...

We need more of this kind of consistency in Sage. `is_imaginary` is another example.

The `.is_real()` method does not handle `NaN` and `+/-Infinity` correctly, for example:

```
sage: CC(NaN).is_real()
True
```

Hi Sebastien. Note that you can also use coercion with the poorest real representation:

```
sage: AA(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: CC(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: RR(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: SR(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: ZZ(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: QQ(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: AA(3) in RealField(2)
True
sage: QQbar(3) in RealField(2)
True
```

though you need to be careful with `NaN` and `+/-Infinity` that also belong to `RealField(2)`. By the way: 

```
sage: SR(Infinity).is_real()
True
```

One clean way to implement `is_real` might be to compare x with its conjugate, which is implemented quite often:

```
sage: def is_real(x):
....:     return(x == x.conjugate())
....:
sage: is_real(ZZ(3))
True
sage: is_real(QQ(3))
True
sage: is_real(AA(3))
True
sage: is_real(RR(3))
True
sage: is_real(CC(3))
True
```
One could handle `is_imaginary` similarly.
