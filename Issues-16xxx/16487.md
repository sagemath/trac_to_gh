<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi Travis,

In my proposed commit I simplified the loops and used the nice string `.format()` method.

I do not think we should go further as Adrien's code can print a tableau of tableaux with centered cell... and even more complicated stuff!! I hope he will submit his code soon (hint).

If you are happy with my review commit, set to positive review.

Vincent
