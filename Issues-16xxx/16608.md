The following example, taken from the documentation of the animate module, produces no visible output in the notebook:

```
sage: sines = [plot(c*sin(x), (-2*pi,2*pi), color=Color(c,0,0), ymin=-1,ymax=1) for c in sxrange(0,1,.2)]
sage: a = animate(sines)
sage: a.show()
```

This is a regression introduced by #12827.  See discussion at #16533.

A good fix for this is in progress as part of a larger effort to unify and expand animation functionality.  This ticket simply restores the functionality in the meantime.

The change is minimal indeed.  I can't check myself whether this works but certainly the code should make it work.

Did you run them with optional tests enabled? ;-)

```

For this ticket, let's focus only on fixing regressions from previous functionality.  Did those things work before #12827?  With the current branch, all of the following work in the notebook:

```
c = animate([circle((i,i), 1-1/(i+1)^2, hue=i/5) for i in srange(0,2,0.2)],xmin=0,ymin=0,xmax=2,ymax=2,figsize=[2,2])
c.show()

[shows the gif]
```

```
c.save(show_path=True)

[saves and returns path '/Users/njohnson/.sage/temp/n15158/65775/tmp_zk_bPS.gif']
```

```
c.save(show_path=True,use_ffmpeg=True)

[saves and returns path '/Users/njohnson/.sage/temp/n15158/65775/tmp_x8eYhm.gif']
```

```
c.save('test.mpg',show_path=True,use_ffmpeg=True)

[saves and returns path '/private/var/folders/vm/9s3hrqs50jgfjhdl20yl9yjnfj74f3/T/tmpJY9m2M/test.mpg'
```

The animations exist at the indicated locations in the indicated formats, and ffmpeg is used when requested.

Examples from the reference manual involving `implicit_plot3d` and Tachyon also work as expected.

The way I read [the diff](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/ff74c22272169319ebc4c134fe19147c7251f1d5), it should have worked, since both these methods called `graphics_filename`. The documentation also indicates as much, e.g. the docstring for `gif()` writes:

```
        If ``savefile`` is not specified: in notebook mode, display the
        animation; otherwise, save it to a default file name.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: a = animate([sin(x + float(k)) for k in srange(0,2*pi,0.7)],
            ....:                xmin=0, xmax=2*pi, figsize=[2,1])
            sage: dir = tmp_dir()
            sage: a.gif()              # not tested
```

This “display the animation” part of the promise is still broken in your fix, and the `a.gif()` call doesn't have a lot of effect since it saves the file in some temporary directory without telling anyone its location.

I must confess that my own changes from #16533 won't fix this either. Only with #16573 did I change the documentation in a way which is not backwards-compatible but at least restores a match between documentation and behavior.

An alternative to your fix would be getting #15515 ready and the replacing *all* occurrences of `tmp_filename` with `graphics_filename`. That should restore old behavior in all relevant cases.

Of course, we could also merge your fix and then build all subsequent modifications on that. After all, your fix is better than no fix at all, and it looks like I might have to rebase most of my animation-related changes anyway.

True.  Maybe just as a hack, one could always add `show_path=True` for `EMBEDDED_MODE`... that might end up annoying.  Maybe just when `if not savefile and EMBEDDED_MODE` one could make `savefile=graphics_filename(ext='.gif')` ?  Would that work?  Too hackish?

I agree, but unfortunately I am traveling this week and probably also unavailable for the next two weeks.  I think this is borderline but just over the threshold for a positive review, but I'll leave that up to you.  I think the options are:

* Positive review as is

* Get someone else to add changes, make more robust

* Downgrade from blocker

I know this isn't a great situation, but I just can't do more at the moment.

Fine. Let's get this over with, and I'll have a look at rebases and proper fixes after that.

Do you mean test suite? Can we run tests inside the notebook server somehow? And see where things end up, what html gets generated and so on? Or am I completely missing the point of what you meant?

In any case, changing tests at this point is probably a bad idea. Should be a separate issue.
