I think it's not the worst solution to silently change `["t"]["t"]` to `["t1"]["t2"]` automatically.

Consider

```
R=QQ['t']
S=R['t']
```
If this results in `S==Q['t1']['t2']` then `S.basering() != R`, and in fact R will not coerce into `S`. That's really bad. Print names of generators are part of the mathematical identity of an object in Sage. We can't change what is supplied, since you wouldn't be producing what is asked for.

The SR issue is different from this commutative algebra ticket. There are also too many cryptic tracebacks in Sage IMO, so I think a warning should be it.
