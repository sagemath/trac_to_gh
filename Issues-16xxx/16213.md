`series` should simplify its terms on a per-term basis:

```
sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: ex=1/(1-x*y-x^2)
sage: ex.series(x,5)
1 + (y)*x + (y^2 + 1)*x^2 + ((y^2 + 1)*y + y)*x^3 + (((y^2 + 1)*y + y)*y + y^2 + 1)*x^4 + Order(x^5)
```
Compare with e.g. Pari:

```
? 1/(1-x*y-x^2) + O(x^5)
%1 = 1 + y*x + (y^2 + 1)*x^2 + (y^3 + 2*y)*x^3 + (y^4 + 3*y^2 + 1)*x^4 + O(x^5)
```
