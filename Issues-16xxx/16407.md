Hi,

on https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/tree/develop
there are two links that show the file VERSION.txt

1: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/VERSION.txt?h=develop

2: https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/VERSION.txt

They show different file contents:

1: Sage version 6.3.beta2, released 2014-05-24

2: Sage version 6.3.beta1, released 2014-05-13

The file was changed 4 days ago. I noticed because this causes my status page to show the wrong version:

http://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-dev-status.html
