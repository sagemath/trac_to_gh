We have different implementations of the algebra of the symmetric group, and more may come in the future:
- `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(K, n)`
- `SymmetricGroup(n).algebra(K)`
- `WeylGroup(['A',3]).algebra(K)`
- ...

They mostly differ in how the elements of the symmetric group are represented, and each representation can have its advantage depending on the application in mind. So it's fine to keep them all. On the other hand, currently only the first one makes use of the special features of the symmetric group. After a discussion, we came up with a plan to share those features across all implementations:

- Make the categories and functionality as coherent as possible.
- Have `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` take an optional input for the index set.

You mean, harder with just the `SymmetricGroups.Algebra` approach?

There is nothing to triplicate in this approach. Everything common is implemented exactly once, in SymmetricGroups.Algebra.

The category is doing just that: providing an ABC. Granted, it might look a bit overkill since we might not need an ABC for the elements or other functorial constructions. But in exchange  (S_n).algebra() is automatically made to inherit from the ABC in a way that is uniform with all the other stuff about XXX algebras: no need to insert manually that ABC in `SymmetricGroup.algebra`.

Okay, done. So some notes for the reviewer:

- Currently `descents` behavior differs from that given by the category, so as to avoid backwards incompatible change, we leave warning messages and leave the behavior alone.

- `reduced_word()` does not respect the order of multiplication and needs to be fixed so that `TestSuite` passes.

- I've added as much common functionality between `SymmetricGroup` and `Permutations` since the former is a gap version of the latter. I'm leaving `WeylGroup` alone because it is a matrix group, but if someone wants to add better support for conjugacy classes, then go ahead.

- I made a bunch of other optimizations for iterating over elements and micro-optimizations.

- I abstracted `StandardPermutations_n` to better reflect the mathematics.

- Better and more careful handling of parents during multiplication.

- The `from_*` now can take a parent as input to better control their output (this was needed).

Some todo's for later:

1. Improve the speed of multiplying Sage permutations:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: R = S.simple_reflections()
sage: %timeit prod(R)
10000 loops, best of 3: 36.6 µs per loop
sage: P = Permutations(5)
sage: R = P.simple_reflections()
sage: %timeit prod(R)
1000 loops, best of 3: 413 µs per loop
```

2. Refactor the `Permutation` class to better be an element class, especially parsing of input (hard and tedious).

3. Fix the issues noted above (also hard).

However, IMO the current version should be reviewed and included into Sage (as it is needed for #11111).

This is the other option, which I am keeping here for the official record:

* Create a category `SymmetricGroups`. Put the relevant groups in this category.
* Generalize the features (Yucis-Murphy elements, ...) from `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` to the category `SymmetricGroups.Algebras`.
* Put `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` in this category, and strip away all the code that is not needed anymore.
* Cross ref the different implementations in the documentation.

Not sure if I'm going to be reviewing this (time is short as usual and I'm still not good at OOP -- case in point, I don't know what mixins are for), but a few remarks.

First, a trivial group needs no generators. So this

```
+ if self.n <= 1:
+ return (self.one(),)
```
can be replaced by

```
+ if self.n <= 1:
+ return ()
```

Second, you are testing for the order-of-multiplication global in `has_left_descent` and in `has_right_descent`. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I don't like it, as it spreads a bad design choice further. Can we agree that the "left" in "left descent" stands for "left action" rather than "multiplying with s_i from the left", or is this too revisionistic?

I appreciate any time you can devote, plus I'd think it would be best that Nicolas takes a good look at this patch (and possibly have Aladin merge it into his current version of #11111 and test it there too).

(Mixins are as they sound to be, they are classes you "mix in" the class heirarchy which typically contain general or independent features. [This SO thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/533631/what-is-a-mixin-and-why-are-they-useful) I think gives a good overview of them.)

> First, a trivial group needs no generators. ...


Good point; fixed.

> Second, you are testing for the order-of-multiplication global in `has_left_descent` and in `has_right_descent`. I understand the reasoning behind it, but I don't like it, as it spreads a bad design choice further. Can we agree that the "left" in "left descent" stands for "left action" rather than "multiplying with s_i from the left", or is this too revisionistic?


It breaks the generic implementation of the `long_element` method, which relies on the multiplication on the left corresponding to `has_left_descent`. I feel these changes further shows `permutation.py` can be a minefield...but I'm trying to make do with what I have.

Hello,

I would love to try to merge into #11111 but this last one cause too many merge conflicts. And some requiere more knowledge than I actually have in order to be solved (in particular those in set.py and integer_ring.py).

It would potentially give false positives, but it's better than the generic one from `Parent` (which is part of the test):

```
sage: P = Permutations(5, avoiding=[1,4,2,3])
sage: P([1,4,2,3,5]) in P
True
```
The idea is to override it for extra information and to include a super call so as to avoid duplicating code (i.e., this is good OOP).

Not done yet (symgp_conjugacy_class.py remains), but there are some things I don't get about this that I'd prefer to have answered before I go on.

- The _mul_ issue, as above.

- The meaning of the index_set parameter: is it just there to allow building the symmetric group algebra with different basis keys?

- _coerce_map_from_ claims that there exists a coercion from `SymmetricGroup(3).algebra(QQ)` to `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)`, but applying this coercion to elements fails. This is because `StandardPermutations_n_abstract.__call__` does not take a permutation group element as a parameter. I am not sure what to do about it, since I wouldn't be happy with duck-typing in that constructor.

- Various methods don't work for `SymmetricGroup(3).algebra(QQ)`, and the fix is not as simple as adding `index_set=self.basis().keys()`.

Although this was the current implementation, I think this is a good as time as any to make this change. Ducktyping and how `Family` works means this shouldn't break anyone's code.

I've made some tweaks to the permutations multiplication, which significantly drops the number of function calls according to `%prun`, as well as cythonizing it. Here's my timings:

```
sage: P = Permutations(5)
sage: x = P.random_element()
sage: y = P.random_element()
sage: %timeit x*y
10000 loops, best of 3: 61.2 µs per loop
sage: P = Permutations(100)
sage: x = P.random_element()
sage: y = P.random_element()
sage: %timeit x*y
1000 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit x*y
10000 loops, best of 3: 87.3 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x*y
1000 loops, best of 3: 210 µs per loop
```
I don't care so much on `retract_okounkov_vershik`, but since you say its a very minor regression, I'm not going to consider it (in fact, it might be faster now with faster multiplication). Here's some timings of `left_action_product`:

```
sage: P = Permutations(5)
sage: x = P.random_element()
sage: Q = Permutations(100)
sage: y = Q.random_element()
sage: %timeit x*y
1000 loops, best of 3: 300 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.left_action_product(y)
10000 loops, best of 3: 167 µs per loop
```
Before:

```
sage: %timeit x*y
1000 loops, best of 3: 225 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.left_action_product(y)
1000 loops, best of 3: 212 µs per loop
```
So there's ~20% slowdown when multiplying different parents, which surprises me somewhat. Let me see if I can fix that for a few minutes...
