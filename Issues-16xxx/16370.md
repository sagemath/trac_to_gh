Hi Nathann,

Could you write in the docs:
- how the graph is built
- what are the parameters (v=n<sup>2</sup>, k=k(n-1), lambda=(k-1)(k-2)+n-2, mu=k(k-1))
Might also be good in the doctests, i.e.

```
sage: OA = designs.WHATEVER_OA(3,7)
sage: G = graphs.OrthogonalArrayGraph(OA)
sage: G.vertices()
...
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(49, 18, 7, 6)
sage: 7^2, 3*(7-1), (3-1)*(3-2)+7-2, 3*(3-1)
(49, 18, 7, 6)
```

The graph depends on the OA(k,n), doesn't it? It might really be that we already have for some parameters several constructions of OA... and hence as many OA-graphs. Would it be possible to have more open input, like `def OrthogonalArrayGraph(data, n=None)` returning what you did if `data=k` and `n=n` but also returns what we think if `data` is set to an `OA`?

The construction is actually much more general: from any set of subsets we can build such a graph. Wikipedia calls it an [Intersection graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_graph) (note: any graph can be obtained that way). When the set of subsets is a transversal design the obtained graph has nice properties but I am quite sure that implementing `graphs.IntersectionGraph` would make more sense.

Isn't that written already ?..

```
The intersection graph of the block of a `TD(k,n)` (see
+    :func:`~sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays.orthogonal_array`) is a
+    strongly regular graph.
```

That's a definition of the graph.

> - what are the parameters (v=n<sup>2</sup>, k=k(n-1), lambda=(k-1)(k-2)+n-2, mu=k(k-1))

The parameters associated with a strongly regular graph.

```
sage: Graph.is_strongly_regular??
```

I don't get what you want me to add.... Only a call to `G.vertices()` ? Brouwer gives the actual parameters of the final OA graph but I don't do this in the docstring, so well....

Yes.

We could have a graph constructos `graphs.IntersectionGraph` taking as an argument a list of sets and returning the corresponding graph. Would make more sense than a dedicated version for OA.

Ahem. I should read the email before I answer them. Indeed, indeed `:-P`

Hi,

So, what is the point of the ticket if we can already do

```
sage: g = Graph([map(Set, designs.transversal_design(3,7)), lambda x,y : x&y])
```
Moreover, the graph you obtain is also strongly regular with BIBD input

```
sage: BIBD = designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(31,6)
sage: V = map(Set, BIBD.blocks())
sage: G = Graph([V, lambda x,y: x&y])
sage: G.is_strongly_regular(parameters=True)
(31, 32, 31, -1)
```

I would rather add those examples to the documentation (of both designs and graphs). We could  possibly add them to the documentation of the not yet existing `graphs.IntersectionGraph`.

Several points :

1) To say that these graphs are stronly regular, and to give them a name such that a guy looking at Brouwer's table can build them here

2) The implementation is better : the syntax above checks whether any two sets have a non-empty intersection, which is not what this code does

3) It may later be useful to have a large collection of constructors for "interesting" graphs (and strongly regular graphs ARE interesting) to check conjectures and stuff

4) We both agree that we needs a `graphs.IntersectionGraph` function because the syntax above is not very natural, don't tell me now that user should find it by themselves `:-P`

Err... Well, this is actually a bug report. The parameters must always be positive. Will look at it right now.

This is now #16433. By the way your BIBD is a projective plane, thus all blocks intersect, thus the intersection graph is a clique, and a clique is not strongly regular for a stupid reason that I do not like.

It is an exception in the definition.

A stupid one.

Yes: this ticket should not go without a `graphs.IntersectionGraph`. And intersection graphs of non-trivial BIBD are regular graph. So it is worth to have them at least in the doc of `graphs.IntersectionGraph`.

For the parameters: they are explicit in terms of (k,n) for TD and (v,k) for BIBD.
* for TD(k,n): lambda=(k-1)(k-2)+n-2, mu=k(k-1)
* for BIBD(v,k): lambda=(k-1)<sup>2</sup>+(v-1)/(k-1)-2, mu=k<sup>2</sup>
and this should be mentioned and tested.

By the way, why is there no BIBD in the Brouwer table?

Hi there,

For BIBD(v,k,1) there is another standard terminology which is Steiner 2-designs S(2,k,v). So if we care about the Brouwer table then we would also add a `graphs.SteinerDesignGraph` instead of a BIBD one. More generally all Steiner systems give strongly regular graphs.
- http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/S.html.
- http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/STS.html
and even more generally, it is written that *the block graph of a quasi-symmetric design is strongly regular.*

I think it would be misleading to call it a Steiner design graph, as an incidence system can give rise to a graph in atleast three different ways:

- Levi Graph: this is a bipartite graph whose vertices are points and lines in the system and adjacency is the incidence of the incidence system. 

- Adjacency graph: the points are the vertices; two vertices are adjacent if they are incident in a common line.

- Block Intersection graph: the vertices are lines of the system and two vertices are adjacent if they meet in some fixed condition on the number of points. 

As I indicated above, it is common to call the graphs that we are talking about as Block intersection graphs. 

A quasi-symmetric design is a 2-design with atmost two block intersection numbers. Those q.s designs with only one block intersection number are the square (or symmetric) 2-designs. One can solve the equations one obtains by using Fischer's variance counting to get the parameters of the SRG in this case. 

Curiously, petersen graph is the block intersection graph of the 2-design 2-(6, 3, 2) (this is a quasi-symmetric design: any two blocks meet in 0 points or 1 point) where you define adjacency among blocks as "being disjoint". See [here](http://sina.sharif.edu/~emahmood/papers/MR1147979.PDF). 

Hope this is helpful.

I added a line about that in the construction of the orthogonal array graph, see commits.

As you saw I asked him to confirm that not all graphs of Steiner Systems with t>2 were strongly regular graphs, as I see no reason why this shold be true.

Which is also why I do not like "SteinerDesignGraph" but at the very least "Steiner2DesignGraph", even though it "contradicts the terminology" we already use, i.e. BIBD.

All right. But as Brouwer said himself in his answer it would be much more consistent to have

```
sage: designs.MyPreferedDesign(x,y,z).block_intersection_graph()
```
and not

```
sage: graphs.BlockIntersectionGraphFromMyPreferedDesign(x,y,z)
```

hum: k=k(n-1)

I see two more obstructions right now:
- having a function with two integers as input makes anybody think that there is a unique graph associated with all OA(k,n). I do not believe that this is True. It must be very clear in the documentation.
- the function `designs.orthogonal_array` might not give the same output between two releases of Sage. So if somebody starts working on OA(5,19) and loves it and find out that three months after her graph disappear, it would be a disaster.

And I believe that it makes sense to have as many constructors of strongly regular graphs in `graph.*`, even though the graphs could be built by other means. That's more or less the point of having a database of graph constructors, same for groups, same for words, same for everything else. Don't you have both a `words.ThueMorseWord` and `words.FixedPointOfMorphism` ?

Ahah. Yeah, I know. I tried to phrase it to avoid confusions, but .... yeah `:-P`

If you see another way..

No problem. I can even add that it may change between versions of Sage.

> - the function `designs.orthogonal_array` might not give the same output between two releases of Sage. So if somebody starts working on OA(5,19) and loves it and find out that three months after her graph disappear, it would be a disaster.

A disaster indeed. I will mention that too in a second.

Here it is. We will also have to add a similar warning in the OA module someday (about results changing/disappearing). Though given that the goal is to match the results of the MOLS I do not think we should worry too much about designs disappearing, it will be the other way around `:-P`

Really, the heuristic to find holes can only give better results than those which are expected in theory, as we deal with actual designs and do not consider the "general properties of some OA(k,n)". We know more about a single design that theory does, and we can compute maximum independent sets while they can't.

And if some construction requires a specific OA, well, they will have to explain it somewhere an we can then implement it.

Branch updated !

Hi,

An OA does not determine uniquely a graph. As Kanappan said there are at least three natural ones and there are many more non-trivial constructions. So calling it `graphs.OrthogonalArrayGraph` completely misleading.

About the syntax, let me cite Andries Brouwer:

    If you have a set with a collection of subsets, that is called a hypergraph, and the subsets are called hyperedges. Given a hypergraph, one can make the intersection graph. The vertices of the hypergraph are the hyperedges. Two distinct vertices are adjacent when their intersection is nonempty. This is a construction that occurs in many different places. A design is a hypergraph with certain regularity properties. But this intersection graph is needed for many types of design.

    It makes no sense to design a system where intersection graph gets different names depending on the type of design one used as input.

So the name could be either `graphs.IntersectionGraphOfOneOrthogonalArray` or simply a subcase of `graphs.IntersectionGraph`. And I am in favour of the second one.

Vincent

It does.

All graphs are intersection graphs, and yet we have different functions to create graphs.
Petersen's graph is a Kneser Graph, yet we have both a `graphs.PetersenGraph` and a `graphs.KneserGraph` function.

There are different ways to create several graphs, and sometimes the planar embeddings associated with them changes depending on which function you call. Besides, if we have a function for BIBD or a function for OA graphs we can add information there about their parameters about strongl regular graphs, and it would have no meaning to add this in a much more general function handling intersection graph.

Besides, some people who read your web page and who may want to create the strongly regular graphs you mention may have absolutely no interest in knowing how they are built, and they may not know even what a design is. I am not just talking, a colleague of mine who could not care less about designs wanted me to implement the graphs of some generalized quadrangle just the other day as well as other things, and she it typically of this type : she wants to work on the graph, but she is not sufficiently interested in the subject to try to learn what an OA is and how they can be built.

Besides, we may want n the future to build an internal database of strongly regular graphs in Sage, and it is interesting for us to know that the functions only have to be fed with integers and not wit something more complicated like OA that we should take from somewhere else. It is better if all functions expect the same kind of arguments.

Okay man.... I really need this ticket to make it in, because I have a lot of useful work above and I don't want to give all this up because of terminology problems.

I also need a function which returns this OA(k,n) graph, not only because it is interesting for guys studying graph theory who may want to have more strongly regular graphs, but also because it is useful in the constructions.

The theorems I implement these days all begin with "If there exists a TD(...), a TD(...), a TD(...) then there exists a TD(...)", and so it appears to me that I need a function which returns "a TD(...)" even though it may not be unique.

What can I do to get this in ?

Hi Nathann,

As `OrthogonalArrayGraph` is ambiguous, what do you think of `OrthogonalArrayIntersectionGraph` or `OrthogonalArrayBlockGraph` or `OrthogonalArrayBlockIntersectionGraph`?

At least, allow the function to be fed with an OA as I suggested in [comment:10](#comment%3A10).

```
def OrthogonalArrayGraph(data, n=None):
    if n is not None:
        data = int(data)
        OA = designs.orthogonal_array(data,n)
    else:
        assert is_orthogonal_array(data)
        OA = data
    ...
```
And, if possible, give examples of two OA with the same parameters that yield to two different intersection graphs...

This graph is not the intersection graph of the blocks of an OA. If you insist, I prefer `designs.OrthogonalArrayBlockGraph`, because to me 'block' has absolutely no meaning in this context.

Ok. Note that this makes sense only because the graph is NOT the intersection graph of the blocks of an OA (which are not even sets but rows with non necessarily distinct coordinates), and that as a result the future syntax `graphs.IntersectionGraph(designs.orthogonal_array(k,n))` would not give the same result.

You meant `intersection` has no meaning ? It depends on how you see the blocks. If you consider them as subsets of {0,...,n-1}<sup>k</sup> then it is the intersection graph of the blocks.

Right.

Of course, I meant non-isomorphic.

Nono. I meant that for me "Block" has no meaning there. "intersection" on the other hand is just wrong. This graph is the intersection graph of a TD, not the intersection graph of an OA whose rows are not even sets.

I would be delighted to hear how you define such an operation, but let's get this done first.

I just finished the job for "different OA". If you want non-isomorphic OA provide them.

Hi,

Two non-isomorphic OA(k,n) might give isomorphic intersection graph (exercise ;-P). I modified the documentation accordingly.

I put a `k'` for the parameters of the srg to avoid ambiguity with the `k` of the TD.

I exchanged the 1 and 2 in the last column of `oa1`, that way it looks closer to `oa0`.

The graph `g0` is actually an affine polar graph, I added it to the documentation. I tried other constructions mentioned in the Brouwer table to find ``g1`` but I did not succeed.

Have a look at u/vdelecroix/16370. Tests pass and documentation build so set to positive review after my commit if you like it.

Vincent
