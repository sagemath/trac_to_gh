I'm a bit surprised by the way algebraic numbers which are indeed rational get represented in LaTeX code. Consider the following case:

```
sage: latex(29/10)
\frac{29}{10}
sage: latex(AA(29/10))
\text{\texttt{29/10}}
```

Is it intentional that these two look different? If so, I guess this might be to make the representation of algebraic numbers consistently single-line, but even then, the `\text` and `\texttt` formatting seem wrong to me.
