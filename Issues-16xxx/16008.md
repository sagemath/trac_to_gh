the group of Manuel Kauers at RISC develops the `ore_algebra` package
(http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/index.php) which is similar to the
Maple gfun package (but more powerful since it works in more general rings), and will be extended to
the multivariate case. A small example with version 0.1:

```
  sage: from ore_algebra import *
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; A.<Dx> = OreAlgebra(R)
  sage: deq = guess([1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21],A)
  sage: deq
  (x^2 + x - 1)*Dx + 2*x + 1
  sage: rec = A(deq).to_S(A2)
  sage: rec
  (-n - 2)*Sn^2 + (n + 2)*Sn + n + 2
```

New optional spkg: http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/ore_algebra-0.1.spkg

But it isn't, is it?

```

I do not suggest to close the ticket as wontfix. I never said that. What I expect is that someone sets positive, and since this ticket is in `packages:optional` I then expect the release manager to download the SPKG and himself copy the relevant files from that into `build/...` as well as providing the `src/` as a tarball. BUT the mgt won't notice at all as long it's not positive.

Again, this ticket is in `packages:optional`, and that means when closed the package will be optional.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A10):
> I do not suggest to close the ticket as wontfix. I never said that. What I expect is that someone sets positive, and since this ticket is in `packages:optional` I then expect the release manager to download the SPKG and himself copy the relevant files from that into `build/...` as well as providing the `src/` as a tarball.

Sorry, I never reviewed optional packages before, and I thought the idea was to use the ticket to review that the package worked well once all that was done, not to decide whether to make it an optional package at all. But if positive review only means "yes, this should be an optional package," then I agree with you.
