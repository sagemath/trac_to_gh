the group of Manuel Kauers at RISC develops the `ore_algebra` package
(http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/index.php) which is similar to the
Maple gfun package (but more powerful since it works in more general rings), and will be extended to
the multivariate case. A small example with version 0.1:

```
  sage: from ore_algebra import *
  sage: R.<x> = QQ[]; A.<Dx> = OreAlgebra(R)
  sage: deq = guess([1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21],A)
  sage: deq
  (x^2 + x - 1)*Dx + 2*x + 1
  sage: rec = A(deq).to_S(A2)
  sage: rec
  (-n - 2)*Sn^2 + (n + 2)*Sn + n + 2
```

New optional spkg: http://www.risc.jku.at/research/combinat/software/ore_algebra/ore_algebra-0.1.spkg

But it isn't, is it?

```
~/co/sage:develop$ ls build/pkgs/ore*
ls: cannot access build/pkgs/ore*: No such file or directory
(exit 2) 
~/co/sage:develop$ sage -optional | grep ore
(exit 1) 
```

Or did you forget to attach a branch to this ticket?

Sorry, I never reviewed optional packages before, and I thought the idea was to use the ticket to review that the package worked well once all that was done, not to decide whether to make it an optional package at all. But if positive review only means "yes, this should be an optional package," then I agree with you.
