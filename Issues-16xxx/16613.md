There is an inconsistency between several implementations of methods `content` for polynomials which either return the gcd of the coefficients or the ideal generated by the coefficients. 

To remove the inconsistency, we implement two distinct methods:

* `content` returns the gcd of the coefficients;
* `content_ideal` returns the ideal generated by the coefficients.

In a period of deprecation, for (most) univariate polynomial rings, `content` is a deprecated alias for `content_ideal`. In the future, `content` will be defined everywhere as described above.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
The content of a polynomial is sometimes defined as the gcd of its coefficients, and sometimes as the ideal generated by the coefficients. In SageMath, we have inconsistencies between polynomial rings:

* For Flint, NTL, p-adics and multivariate polynomial rings, `content` returns the gcd of the coefficients.

* The generic implementation (for the class `rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial`) returns an ideal. This is means that for polynomials over *weird* rings, and for all sparsely represented univariate polynomials, `content` returns an ideal.

**I propose to make all the implementations return a element of the base ring rather than an ideal.**

Rationale: 

* This means changing only one method.
* This is consistent with [MuPAD](http://fr.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/mupad_ref/content.html), [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=content), [Mathematica](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FactorTermsList.html) (though the name of the function is different) and [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/214#1841) (also for the [multivariate case](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/handbook/text/227#2005))
* This is the definition taken for instance by von zur Gathen and Gerhard in *Modern Computer Algebra* or Cohen in *A course in Computational Number Theory*.

P.S.: I cc the author and reviewer of #12218 in which the generic `content` was implemented.

I am trying to provide some code for this. I'd like opinions on two points:

1. To avoid future inconsistencies, I plan to implement not only `content` and `content_ideal`, but also the related `primitive_part` and `is_primitive` for all polynomial rings with consistent semantics. Do you think it is appropriate to do so in this ticket, or do you think that it's better to stick with `content` and `content_ideal` only?

2. What should it be the semantic for fields? 

---
#### Remarks for the semantics for fields:

Currently, there is a method `is_primitive` which uses three distinct (and documented!) semantics:
* An irreducible polynomial of degree *m* over **F**<sub>p</sub> is primitive if its roots generate **F**<sub>p^m</sub>;
* A polynomial over a ring is primitive if its coefficients generate the unit ideal;
* Primitivity is undefined for polynomials over an infinite field, that is an exception is raised.

I guess that there should not be any opposition for `content_ideal` to return the unit ideal. For `content`, I see three possibilities (there may be more):
* Raise an exception;
* Return `1` (or more precisely `self._parent.one()`);
* Return `gcd(self.coefficients())` (knowing that `gcd(2/3,4/5)=2/15` with the current semantics for `gcd`.
And I would say that in all three cases, `primitive_part` should return `self` divided by its content, using for content the same semantic as above. Finally, the case of `is_primitive` is complicated because of the semantic for finite fields. One possibility could be to find another name for this semantic for finite fields but 1. I guess that "primitive" is really the word used in mathematics for this property, and 2. this may break some existing code (and given the current discussions on sage-devel, I doubt the community would favor this!).

P.S.: I *really* would like that we reach some consensus on the semantics before including any code in order to limit as much as possible future backward incompatible changes!

It generally is best for the development workflow if individual tickets are as limited as possible. So I would vote in favor of creating a second ticket to deal with `is_primitive` and `primitive_part` after the status of `content` is resolved.

Regarding `primitive`, both uses seem to be quite entrenched in the mathematical literature, and so I think we are obliged to maintain the dichotomy.

The changes look fine to me.
It is my understanding that we should deprecate, i.e., `content()` should say `content() is not going to return an ideal but an element in the future. Use content_ideal() instead.`

What do you think?

Yes.

That would certainly break existing code. It points you to the place where you have to fix it so it would be fine with me. I am not sure what our policy is here.

If we go for this we should remove that parameter completely after some time. I am also fine with this approach but I find it a bit weird to do deprecation by introducing something deprecated (the `ideal` parameter).

> What do you think?

I think the first option (do not change `content()` at first but print a warning) is the cleanest option.

I've merged `develop` (8.0.beta11) into this ticket's branch since it did not apply. 

Now I agree with Travis that the deprecation is a bit a pity. It will force users to make two changes instead of one when they need the content (as a value rather than an ideal): Now they write `p.content().gen()`, they need to change to `p.content_ideal().gen()` due to the current deprecation warning, and in some months (years?) they'll finally be able to write `p.content()` to avoid the useless construction of the ideal. I'm strongly in favor of having a way for users to directly use the new semantic. 

As such, I would go for making `content` return a value without any deprecation. If the there's enough time left, this backward incompatible change may occur with the new release 8.0.

The implementation looks good to me.

What is the deprecation strategy now? Do we want this to go in and have a followup ticket (to be merged in a year) to have content return an element? If so, there should be such a ticket and a comment in the code.

Or do we want to change this without deprecation? We missed the 8.0 window, so I am slightly in favor of the two step change.

I was in favor of a direct change with the argument of "the sooner the better" but the result was endless discussions and the ticket waits for 3 years! So in order for this ridiculously simple issue to be fixed *at some point*, let's say we implement the two phase change.

Replying to [@slel](#comment%3A32):
Agree, done! Note that I put this comment only for univariate polynomial rings since in the multivariate case, a method `content` exists (and is linked).

Now needs review (again!).
