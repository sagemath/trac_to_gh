It seems that there is a small but positive probability that the factors found by the GMP-ECM elliptic curve factorisation program are in non-increasing order.  From [a recent patchbot report](http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/11475/debian/wheezy/sid/x86_64/3.2.0-57-generic/selmer/2014-05-07%2007:23:33%20+0100):

I have not been able to reproduce this, nor can Google find it in other patchbot reports.

This is related to #10951, which makes GMP-ECM's optional `sigma` argument accessible in the interface; passing such a sigma would give deterministic behaviour.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

indeed, the closer the (smallest) factors, the higher is the probability that the factor
found is non-deterministic:

```
sage: f = ECM()
sage: n=6366805760909033411615543376840901
sage: f.find_factor(n)
[79792266297612017, 79792266297612053]
sage: f.find_factor(n)
[79792266297612053, 79792266297612017]
```
A better check would be to first sort the liste returned (in case of two prime factors).

How about letting `_parse_output()` always sort the list of pairs `(factor, probable_prime)` before returning it, regardless of the number of factors and the value of `probable_prime` for each?

but then we would lose some information, since the first factor is the one which is really found by ECM.

And with 3 prime factors or more, we would still have non-deterministic output.
