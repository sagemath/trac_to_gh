Caching does currently not work for unhashable elements

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def f(x):
....:     return x
....:
sage: K.<a> = Qq(9)
sage: f(a)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement'
```

In this case `a` should not be hashable since its current operator `==` could
never be made consistent with a non-trivial hash value (cf. #11895).
However, such elements should be cacheable.

This ticket adds a `_cache_key()` for such elements which can be used to hash and
compare unhashable elements. That method should then return a tuple (or
anything else that is hashable) which uniquely identifies the element, e.g. for
p-adics the precision and a lift of the element to the integers.

Depends on #16251

It seems that the problem really has to do with key comparison in dictionaries, not with hashing or caching specifically.  Given (1) Python's use of `==` for key comparison and (2) Sage's lenient implementation of `==` for elements, we basically cannot use Sage elements as dictionary keys.

One would like a third comparison operator, say `equal`<sup>1</sup>, that regards two objects as equal if and only if all their "mathematically relevant" properties (e.g. value and precision for real or *p*-adic numbers, but not memory location) are the same.  Our caching problems would then disappear if keys were compared using `equal`.  In this hypothetical case, the correct property for hash functions would be `X equal Y` => `hash(X) == hash(Y)`.

- Do I understand correctly that the purpose of `cache_key` can be viewed as emulating the "missing" `equal` by assigning to each object `X` a (hashable) object `cache_key(X)` satisfying the condition `cache_key(X) == cache_key(Y)` <=> `X equal Y` ?

- If so, does the implementation in this ticket satisfy this condition?  (I am mainly worried that the parent of an element `x` does not seem to be encoded in `cache_key(x)`.)

<sup>1</sup> I just looked up the different comparison functions (`=`, `eq`, `eql`, `equal` and `equalp`) in Lisp and `equal` seems to be the closest to what we would need, hence I am using that notation.  However, Lisp uses `eql` by default for hash tables.

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>\nReplying to [@pjbruin](#comment%3A8):\n> It seems that the problem really has to do with key comparison in dictionaries, not with hashing or caching specifically.  Given (1) Python's use of `==` for key comparison and (2) Sage's lenient implementation of `==` for elements, we basically cannot use Sage elements as dictionary keys.\n\nThis is not really the topic of the ticket, but I do not agree. It depends on what you want to do. If you have sufficient control over which elements are put in the dictionary, then you can use Sage objects. Of course you are right, that our `==` causes a lot of trouble.\n\n> One would like a third comparison operator, say `equal`<sup>1</sup>, that regards two objects as equal if and only if all their \"mathematically relevant\" properties (e.g. value and precision for real or *p*-adic numbers, but not memory location) are the same.  Our caching problems would then disappear if keys were compared using `equal`.  In this hypothetical case, the correct property for hash functions would be `X equal Y` => `hash(X) == hash(Y)`.\n\nSuch an operator might be helpful and would really fix trouble with caching. Then again, when are two objects `equal`? Do their parents have to be identical? Or just `equal`? It is not clear to me whether there can be a generic implementation that makes everybody happy. If you are aware of the current limitations, then you can work around the problems.\n\n> - Do I understand correctly that the purpose of `cache_key` can be viewed as emulating the \"missing\" `equal` by assigning to each object `X` a (hashable) object `cache_key(X)` satisfying the condition `cache_key(X) == cache_key(Y)` <=> `X equal Y` ?\n\nYes and no. The idea is really to give elements a `hash` which don't have one normally. The intention was to do something similar to what you propose above: Two unhashable elements in the same parent with equal cache key should behave identical in any reasonable computation. (There is of course room for interpretation in this 'definition'.)\n\n> - If so, does the implementation in this ticket satisfy this condition?  (I am mainly worried that the parent of an element `x` does not seem to be encoded in `cache_key(x)`.)\n\nI did this on purpose. I replicate the current behaviour in sage, i.e., if you mix elements with different parents in one dictionary, then you really need to know what you are doing. Why not include the parent? Well, are two parents equal if they are `==`-equal, or identical, and what if they can not be hashed (which will be the case for `p`-adic extension fields).\n\nI have no strong opinion on whether or not to include the parent but I think it can be more confusing than helpful. Also keys might unnecessarily be rather large. If your application will only get elements from a single parent but you store all the data needed to create the extension field with every element in a cache, that could be really a waste. We could of course only store `id(parent)`; but I'm not sure whether that is too extreme.",

This is not really the topic of the ticket, but I do not agree. It depends on what you want to do. If you have sufficient control over which elements are put in the dictionary, then you can use Sage objects. Of course you are right, that our `==` causes a lot of trouble.

> One would like a third comparison operator, say `equal`<sup>1</sup>, that regards two objects as equal if and only if all their "mathematically relevant" properties (e.g. value and precision for real or *p*-adic numbers, but not memory location) are the same.  Our caching problems would then disappear if keys were compared using `equal`.  In this hypothetical case, the correct property for hash functions would be `X equal Y` => `hash(X) == hash(Y)`.

Such an operator might be helpful and would really fix trouble with caching. Then again, when are two objects `equal`? Do their parents have to be identical? Or just `equal`? It is not clear to me whether there can be a generic implementation that makes everybody happy. If you are aware of the current limitations, then you can work around the problems.

> - Do I understand correctly that the purpose of `cache_key` can be viewed as emulating the "missing" `equal` by assigning to each object `X` a (hashable) object `cache_key(X)` satisfying the condition `cache_key(X) == cache_key(Y)` <=> `X equal Y` ?

Yes and no. The idea is really to give elements a `hash` which don't have one normally. The intention was to do something similar to what you propose above: Two unhashable elements in the same parent with equal cache key should behave identical in any reasonable computation. (There is of course room for interpretation in this 'definition'.)

> - If so, does the implementation in this ticket satisfy this condition?  (I am mainly worried that the parent of an element `x` does not seem to be encoded in `cache_key(x)`.)

I did this on purpose. I replicate the current behaviour in sage, i.e., if you mix elements with different parents in one dictionary, then you really need to know what you are doing. Why not include the parent? Well, are two parents equal if they are `==`-equal, or identical, and what if they can not be hashed (which will be the case for `p`-adic extension fields).

I have no strong opinion on whether or not to include the parent but I think it can be more confusing than helpful. Also keys might unnecessarily be rather large. If your application will only get elements from a single parent but you store all the data needed to create the extension field with every element in a cache, that could be really a waste. We could of course only store `id(parent)`; but I'm not sure whether that is too extreme.

Sorry if this sounded off-topic; I was thinking of the dictionaries used in caching, but didn't focus on that because I thought my "objections" were applicable to dictionaries in Sage in general.

I also wanted to avoid focussing on hashing because actually I don't fully understand what the criteria are for objects to be hashable.  The only thing that is clear to me is that if the "mathematical meaning" can change over time (e.g. if the object is a list whose length can change, or a matrix on which you can perform row/column operations), then the object should not be hashable.

Sure, but `@cached_function` should also work for user functions, and we have no control over what kind of arguments the user is going to feed those.

I would say the only option (for caching purposes) is to make two elements `equal` only if their parents are identical, otherwise you will get cases where the cached function returns values in wrong (equal but not identical) parents.  Hence I would translate this hypothetical `equal` (for elements) in terms of `cache_key` as `x equal y` <=> `parent(x) is parent(y) and cache_key(x) == cache_key(y)`.

I see. I guess this means that we should at least have that if `a != b`, then `some_cached_function(a)` should have a chance to be `!= some_cached_function(b)`.

Imho, `@cached_method` and `@cached_function` should not differ in such a way. Storing the parent's `id` is not a waste of memory and should hardly lead to any surprises.

I'll push a new commit which implements the inclusion of the parent. Thanks for joining this discussion btw.

I don't think that the word "cache" is necessarily connected to "hashing". A hashtable is one way of caching but there are others. (I just checked, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_%28computing%29 does not contain the word 'hash'.)

Is it acceptable for you if we leave the current wording?

The latter would actually speed things up for things whose hash is long to compute (ex. large degree dense polynomials).\n\n- I'm worried about not using the hash for polynomials for caching. I feel that `_cache_key` should result `self` for every hashable object. For example, this no longer would cache as the same element:\n\n```\nsage: R.<x> = QQ[]\nsage: p = R(range(100))\nsage: hash(p)\n1520766690567384545\nsage: hash(p._cache_key())\n-4253877232222459194\n\nsage: R.<x> = ZZ[]\nsage: p = R(range(100))\nsage: hash(p)\n1520766690567384545\nsage: hash(p._cache_key())\n6965062123311622150\n```\n  So now you're requiring everyone to be *very* careful about the parent an object belongs too.\n\n- I'm pretty sure using the parent's `id` will break pickling with the cache. So suppose you create parent `A`, store an element `a` in a cache `C`. Now you pickle and unpickle `a`, `A`, and `C`. The `id` of `A` is different than before the pickle and unpickling, so we are no longer able to retrieve `a` from `C`:\n\n```\nsage: R = QQ['x']\nsage: p = R(range(100))\nsage: hash(p._cache_key())\n-4253877232222459194\nsage: dumps(p)\n# This is some pickle\n# Start a new sage session:\nsage: s = # The pickle above\nsage: hash(loads(s)._cache_key())\n2293648738429524678\nsage: hash(loads(s)) # This is persistent across sessions\n1520766690567384545\n```\n\nI think both of the last two are issues that need to be addressed.",

So there's no statistically significant slowdown that I can see.

Some other design questions/comments:

- Is there some reason why you didn't `cpdef _cache_key(self)` or make it into a `@lazy_attribute` since it cannot change over the lifetime of the object? The latter would actually speed things up for things whose hash is long to compute (ex. large degree dense polynomials).

- I'm worried about not using the hash for polynomials for caching. I feel that `_cache_key` should result `self` for every hashable object. For example, this no longer would cache as the same element:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: hash(p)
1520766690567384545
sage: hash(p._cache_key())
-4253877232222459194

sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: hash(p)
1520766690567384545
sage: hash(p._cache_key())
6965062123311622150
```
  So now you're requiring everyone to be *very* careful about the parent an object belongs too.

- I'm pretty sure using the parent's `id` will break pickling with the cache. So suppose you create parent `A`, store an element `a` in a cache `C`. Now you pickle and unpickle `a`, `A`, and `C`. The `id` of `A` is different than before the pickle and unpickling, so we are no longer able to retrieve `a` from `C`:

```
sage: R = QQ['x']
sage: p = R(range(100))
sage: hash(p._cache_key())
-4253877232222459194
sage: dumps(p)
# This is some pickle
# Start a new sage session:
sage: s = # The pickle above
sage: hash(loads(s)._cache_key())
2293648738429524678
sage: hash(loads(s)) # This is persistent across sessions
1520766690567384545
```

I think both of the last two are issues that need to be addressed.

Right.

Good.

Fixed.

Sorry, I'm not familiar with this term.

I can understand this point. Strengthening `==` would be a fairly huge project, affecting a lot of code. Many people would be opposed to this (including myself).

This could be changed.

I do not understand `@lazy_attribute` very well. What would be the implications of this? If it can't hurt us, then I don't mind changing it.

> - I'm worried about not using the hash for polynomials for caching. I feel that `_cache_key` should result `self` for every hashable object.

`_cache_key()` is only invoked if the object is unhashable. For most hashable objects it raises an error.

I don't think so. `_cache_key` would never be called in this case.

This is a compromise for elements which are unhashable. This was already discussed above.

> - I'm pretty sure using the parent's `id` will break pickling with the cache. So suppose you create parent `A`, store an element `a` in a cache `C`. Now you pickle and unpickle `a`, `A`, and `C`.

I agree. This is a very serious problem.

From my point of view, only the last point needs to be addressed.

It's a very good idea to include the description in the summary of `cachefunc.pyx`. But I also think it should be in `SageObject._cache_key`; if somebody is wondering what it is good for, that is the first place where they will look for it. It is a duplication of docstrings but I hope it is acceptable.

I made a few changes to your commit:
* I removed some debug statements.
* Your changes to `_cache_key` change the current behaviour. Say you have a tuple of a polynomial over the rationals and a p-adic number. The old version would only call `_cache_key` of the p-adic number and leave the polynomial. Your version unpacks both which is unnecessary. I restored my version of the code.
* The default implementation of `_cache_key` should raise an error. If somebody calls it (misunderstanding what it is good for), then it makes sense to warn people that they did something wrong: the code in `SageObject._cache_key()` will never be executed in a legitimate context. I do not mind raising a `TypeError` instead of a `NotImplementedError`.

> Thanks for dealing with my nagging.

No worries. After all you found a very serious bug (`id(parent)`).

> That's not correct. At least when you have a Python class, a lazy attribute *will* be a plain python attribute after the first access. Indeed, a lazy attribute `L` defined for some class `C` has a `__get__` method, so that `L.__get__(O, C)` assigns the output value to `O.L`, for an instance `O` of `C`. In other words, it overrides itself by the return value and thus is exactly as fast as a usual python attribute, after the first access.

Ah right. Then perhaps I was thinking a `@cached_method` with no args was faster than a Python attribute access? *shrugs*

> However, if `C` is a Cython class, attribute assignment does not always work. Hence, in this case, `L.__get__(O,C)` will not be able to assign the return value to `O.L`. By consequence, the `__get__` method will be called upon each single access. Hence, if I see that correctly, the performance will be worse than calling a method.

Hmm...is that an issue with the extension class not necessarily having a `__dict__` and related to the `@lazy_attribute` not always working with (Cython) inheritance?

> No, this isn't a problem because equal parents have equal hashes.

That is exactly what causes the problem.  Consider the following example with a hypothetical parent class `MyParent` that has unhashable elements but does not have unique representation:

```
sage: @cached_function
sage: def f(x):
....:     """
....:     Return `x^2 + 1` in the parent of `x`.
....:     """
....:     return x^2 + 1
....: 
sage: P = MyParent()
sage: Q = MyParent()  # Q is equal but not identical to P
sage: f(P(0)).parent() is P
True
sage: f(Q(0)).parent() is Q
False  # since the parents are equal, f(q) returns the cached f(p)
sage: f(P(0)) is f(Q(0))
True
```
This already happens before this patch with parent *P* and *Q* where there exists a coercion map compatible with hashing (e.g. **Z** and **Q**):

```
sage: @cached_function
....: def f(x):
....:     return x^2 + 1
....: 
sage: f(ZZ(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: f(QQ(0)).parent()
Integer Ring
sage: f(ZZ(0)) is f(QQ(0))
True
```
However, I think we should avoid this situation whenever possible.
