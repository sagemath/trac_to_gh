The problem is the signature doesn't match the domain, so the incorrect conversion map is being called.

More specifically, I have an algebra (with a basis) where I want to be able to construct elements from the input of `(R, R, R)`. However it errors out because it's trying to apply the natural coercion from the base ring into my algebra.

```python
class Foo(Parent):
    def __init__(self, R):
        Parent.__init__(self, base=R, category=AlgebrasWithBasis(R))
    def _element_constructor_(self, *args):
        return self.element_class(self, *args)
    class Element(Element):   # Remember to import Element in the command line
        def __init__(self, parent, *args):
            Element.__init__(self, parent)
            self.value = args
        def _repr_(self):
            return "bar: {}".format(self.value)
```
So try:

```
sage: F = Foo(ZZ)
sage: F._element_constructor_(1, 2, 3)
bar: (1, 2, 3)
sage: F(1, 2, 3)
...
TypeError: Underlying map <type 'instancemethod'> does not accept additional arguments
```
Really I'm wanting a (conversion) map from `R x R x R` to my algebra.

Note that `F(1)` goes into an infinite loop because I haven't defined a `one()` method, nor multiplication.
