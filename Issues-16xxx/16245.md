To continue the discussion from [#12880 comment:17](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12880#comment:17) and [#12880 comment:21](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/12880#comment:21), I agree it is useful to have "formal" composition (returning a chain of isogenies) besides "flesh-and-blood" composition (returning a single isogeny).

Which of the two the user wants depends of course on the application.  The "principle of least surprise" suggests that if `phi` and `psi` are of type `EllipticCurveIsogeny`, then `phi * psi` should again be an `EllipticCurveIsogeny`.  I am thinking of the analogy with integers: if `m` and `n` are of type `Integer`, then `m * n` returns an `Integer`, which does not remember `m` and `n`; there is a separate `Factorization` class for that.

Hence I would be in favour of making `phi * psi` mean "flesh-and-blood" composition, and to have a differently named method, say `phi.chain(psi)`, that returns chains of isogenies.  (There doesn't seem to be an existing class for arbitrary finite chains of morphisms in a category; `sage.categories.map.FormalCompositeMap` only supports compositions of two morphisms.)

Agreed. Let's not overdesign the `EllipticCurveIsogeny` class.

Still, I am a bit concerned about efficiency. Contrary to the case of integers and factorisations, the factored form requires much less storage than the "normalized" form. But this is a much more general discussion, that does not only affect isogenies.

Well, arbitrary chains are already supported by this class, although associativity is broken by design. It shouldn't be too much work to modify `FormalCompositeMap` so that it stores a list of morphisms instead of a pair.

However, such an object seems to belong to the category framework. Haven't the combinat people worked on this yet?

Merged the latest beta and made a few small whitespace fixes.

I think this is basically fine.  With regard to the above discussion about "formal" versus "real" composition, I don't have a strong opinion on what the default should be.  So if nobody objects to the current state (composing isogenies returns a `FormalCompositeMap`) this can get a positive review.
