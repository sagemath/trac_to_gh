Keywords: singular bug interreduced_basis

The following example ends in a 
segfault in libsingular:

```
R.<x,y> = ZZ[];
I = R.ideal(x, 5*y, -3*x-4*y+2)
I.interreduced_basis()
```

The bug is fixed upstream among some other bugs (e.g. in Singulars syz(), reduce(), mstd(); see Singulars bugtracker)
for polynomial rings with integer coefficients , but not in a stable release.
