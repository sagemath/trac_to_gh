In Sage 6.3 we have

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = R.ideal(y^2 - 2*y + 1, x + 1/4*y - 5/4)
sage: solve(I.gens(), [SR(x) for x in R.gens()], solution_dict=true)
[]
```
But in 6.1.1 we got

```
sage: solve(I.gens(), [SR(x) for x in R.gens()], solution_dict=true)
[{x: 1, y: 1}]
```
which was the correct solution.

Hi,

I would not say this is a bug. If you want to use the function `solve`, you need to feed it with symbolic polynomials

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: Sx, Sy = var('x,y')
sage: I = R.ideal(y^2 - 2*y + 1, x + 1/4*y - 5/4)
sage: f0,f1 = I.gens()
sage: f0 = f0.subs(x=Sx, y=Sy); f1 = f1.subs(x=Sx, y=Sy)
sage: solve([f0,f1], [Sx,Sy], solution_dict=true)
[{x: 1, y: 1}]
```

The "bug" comes from `solve` which does not type check the input as it should. Note that when the input is one polynomial the check is done

```
sage: f0,f1 = I.gens()
sage: solve(f0, [Sx,Sy])
Traceback (most recent call last): 
...
TypeError: The first argument must be a symbolic expression or a list of symbolic expressions.
```

Ok, this is definitly a workaround and maybe should be mentioned somewhere. Anyhow, I do not like that solve as in the original problem accepts polynomials but then does not give a solution (while it did some versions ago)
