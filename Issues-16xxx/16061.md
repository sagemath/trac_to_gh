Intersection now constructs the automaton (or transducer) which accepts (computes) the intersection 
of the languages of the given automata (transducers). This was earlier done by cartesian_product. A given input is accepted if it was accepted by both given finite state machines. Furthermore, for transducers, the output has to be same in both given transducer. Furthermore, transitions with empty input (or output, for transducers) are not allowed.

For an automaton, cartesian_product does the same as intersection. But for transducers, it 
returns a transducer which computes the pairs of output labels of the given transducer with a given input. 
Thus, the output sequences of both given transducers for a given input are combined into a sequence of pairs of outputlabels.

A deprecation warning is given when Transducer.cartesian_product is called as the output has changed substantially.
