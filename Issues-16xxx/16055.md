Correct. If it's an element of the Jordan algebra, then regular `_mul_` gets called.

It's not. I cited Jacobson (as I believe it's in there but I don't have the book right now to check [tonight I will]), but it's on the wikipedia page (which I didn't want to explicitly cite).

Here's why the `~` is safer than `/`:

```
sage: R.<q,t> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: 1 / R(2)
1/2
sage: _.parent()
Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
sage: ~R(2)
1/2
sage: _.parent()
Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in q, t over Rational Field
```
Although this might be fixed by #17740. However I think instead of `QQ`, we could just convert to (the fraction field of) the base ring. I'll test and make changes.

I'm happy with setting `algebras_generators = basis`, and subclassing does not respect aliases (this has given me many headaches, but it makes sense from the python perspective). I'll do this on my next commit.

Does this mean that this will break again when the base ring coercion is reintroduced?

Also, I've finished reviewing this, but there is a TODO in the latest commit.

This isn't a coercion for non-commutative base rings. The commutativity of the associative algebra actually suppresses the non-associativity of the Jordan algebra since

```
(xy + yx)/2 = xy = yx
(yz + zy)/2 = yz = zy
(xyz + zyx)/2 = xyz = yxz = ... = zyx
```
Perhaps we could add extra checks for the base ring being commutative and adding such a coercion if there is a need, but for now I think we have the conversion and left/right actions.

> Also, I've finished reviewing this, but there is a TODO in the latest commit.

Fixed; sign error. So can I consider this as a positive review?

Uhm, the base ring is assumed to be commutative, right? Are you talking about a coercion from the base ring, or from the algebra which serves as a ground set? Which of these would break the element constructor?

And yes, this is a positive review, apart from this little issue.
