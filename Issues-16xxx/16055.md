Does this mean that this will break again when the base ring coercion is reintroduced?

Also, I've finished reviewing this, but there is a TODO in the latest commit.

This isn't a coercion for non-commutative base rings. The commutativity of the associative algebra actually suppresses the non-associativity of the Jordan algebra since

```
(xy + yx)/2 = xy = yx
(yz + zy)/2 = yz = zy
(xyz + zyx)/2 = xyz = yxz = ... = zyx
```
Perhaps we could add extra checks for the base ring being commutative and adding such a coercion if there is a need, but for now I think we have the conversion and left/right actions.

> Also, I've finished reviewing this, but there is a TODO in the latest commit.


Fixed; sign error. So can I consider this as a positive review?

<a id='comment:24'></a>Uhm, the base ring is assumed to be commutative, right? Are you talking about a coercion from the base ring, or from the algebra which serves as a ground set? Which of these would break the element constructor?

And yes, this is a positive review, apart from this little issue.

    "body": "<a id='comment:25'></a>Right, we are... The issue is when we have a coercion from the base ring, the first input gets checked to see if there is a coercion, and if there is, then it passes all arguments via that coercion (ignoring that the combination of elements should give a different coercion/conversion). So I could one of the two:\n\n- leave it as it is,\n- add a custom coercion from the base ring and put back the known bug tag.\n\nWhich is your preference?",

```

You should say that #16492 is not the only obstruction to the coercion.

Once done, this is positive_review! I'd make the change myself, but that would add yet another merge commit.
