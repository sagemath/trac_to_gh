Could you use `six.moves.urllib` instead? We already include six as a standard package, so it is fine to use it.

I was using this page 

http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html

as a reference, and it says that six could not handle urllib. Maybe this is outdated ?

Do we really gain something by using six instead of the "try except" ? In other words, do you really want me to spend more time on that ? I may have other things to do.
