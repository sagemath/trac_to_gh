The tool 2to3 changes the respective import statements to the new Py3 names.


But the code has to depend on the Python version!

There are 16 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Keywords: **python3**

I was using this page 

http://python3porting.com/stdlib.html

as a reference, and it says that six could not handle urllib. Maybe this is outdated ?

Do we really gain something by using six instead of the "try except" ? In other words, do you really want me to spend more time on that ? I may have other things to do.
