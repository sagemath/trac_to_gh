Coxeter graphs are undirected graph without multiedges with possibly labeled edges within the set {4,5,...,oo}. Coxeter graphs encode Coxeter systems. A Coxeter system is a group presented with a special set of generators.

To represent a Coxeter group, one can use the canonical geometric representation, see Chapter 5 of Humphreys for instance. In this representation, the group acts faithfully on a vector space and preserves a canonical bilinear form.

For infinite Coxeter groups, it is useful to allow a more general bilinear form, which still gives a faithful representation and has the advantage that every reflection subgroup is represented as a general geometric representation.

These more general representations can be encoded into a generalized Coxeter graph where labels "oo" can be replaced by any real number $c <= -1$. The case $c=-1$ represents the canonical choice, in this case one can keep the label "oo".

The class for generalized Coxeter graphs will be based on the class DynkinDiagram and adapted for its purposes.

Depends on #17798

Here is a first "very dirty version" of the patch.

Basically, everything is still to be looked over...

This is just for you to have a look. I will continue in more detail soon enough.
