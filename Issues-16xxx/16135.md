Ring homomorphisms whose domain is the fraction field of a quotient ring don't work correctly:

```
sage: R.<x, y> = QQ[]
sage: K = R.quotient(x^2 - y^3).fraction_field()
sage: L.<t> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: f = K.hom((t^3, t^2))                                                            
sage: f
Ring morphism:
  From: Fraction Field of Quotient of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field by the ideal (-y^3 + x^2)
  To:   Rational function field in t over Rational Field
  Defn: xbar |--> t^3
        ybar |--> t^2
sage: f(K.gens()[0])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError
```
This can be fixed by implementing `QuotientRingElement._im_gens_()`.


Keywords: quotient ring fraction field homomorphism

Looks good to me. Peter could you take a look to the changes I have made to the doc? It is a private method, but I think that one should still try to follow the general guidelines.

Thanks, I agree on the importance of good documentation.  I just made a few more changes in the formulation and typesetting.
