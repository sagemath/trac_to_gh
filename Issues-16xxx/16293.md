On OS X, if you use `os.unlink` on a directory, you get an OSError, "[Errno 1] Operation not permitted". We need to catch this so that `sage-cleaner` works properly. (On linux machines, you seem to get OSError, "[Errno 21] Is a directory".)

Note that without this patch, `sage-cleaner` keeps writing this to the log file:

```
Checking PIDs [36850]
Process 36850 is no longer running, so we clean up
Deleting /Users/palmieri/.sage/temp/jpalmieri/36850

without successfully deleting the directory. So after a while, the log file is quite large, the directory is still there, and `sage-cleaner` is still running.

Fix certainly looks correct, but I can't test whether it really fixes the problem on MacOS X right now...
