This should work:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = random_vector(ZZ, 10); v
(2, 2, 0, 0, 4, -1, 30, -1, 1, -145)
sage: P(v)
-145*x^9 + x^8 - x^7 + 30*x^6 - x^5 + 4*x^4 + 2*x + 2
```

It isn't as straight forward as that: every class implements its own `__init__` without using the superclass. I implemented this for a few more classes.
