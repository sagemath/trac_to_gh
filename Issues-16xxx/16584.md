This should work:

```
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = random_vector(ZZ, 10); v
(2, 2, 0, 0, 4, -1, 30, -1, 1, -145)
sage: P(v)
-145*x^9 + x^8 - x^7 + 30*x^6 - x^5 + 4*x^4 + 2*x + 2
```

It isn't as straight forward as that: every class implements its own `__init__` without using the superclass. I implemented this for a few more classes.

So because it's python code which manipulates objects in memory, you shouldn't wrap it because the interrupt will not clean up the partial allocation. Instead one should use `sign_check`. Is this correct?
