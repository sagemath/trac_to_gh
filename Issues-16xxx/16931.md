Thanks for your work on this.  First two few small points:

1. In the documentation for ellcard(), we need to say that when self is defined over Q and p is a prime of bad reduction then the number returned is the size of the group of nonsingular points on the reduction (i.e. p-1, p+1 or p depending).  I wondered about this, did some experiments, and then verified with the pari documentation.

2. Why is ellorder() removed?

I think someone other than me should review this.  There is a vast amount of code written by me being removed here, which is hard.  Without going into the details of the pari implementation I would not want to agree to removing the special code for j=0 and j=1728 in characteristics 2 and 3.  We had to do quite a lot of mathematics to get this right, which was not in the literature, and even the examples here are quite instructive.

Secondly, the old code was careful to only ever do counting over the field generated over the prime field by the j-invariant.  From there is is quite easy to get the cardinality of any twist over any extension.  Do you know that pari does that too?  Try taking a curve over a small field, base-changing to an extension, applying  a random twist, and then asking for the cardinality.  With my code it swould take no longer than on the original.  Is that still true?

I thought we had a convention for situations like this, that a Sage-only implementation could be kept and used if some parameter 'algorithm' was set?  The parameter could be 'pari' by default.

For the record, I totally understand that. I had the same feeling when the PARI people implemented splitting field for polynomials over QQ which completely outperformed my implementation.

However, I consider it a "fact of life" that old code has to make place for new and better code.

> I thought we had a convention for situations like this, that a Sage-only implementation could be kept and used if some parameter 'algorithm' was set? The parameter could be 'pari' by default.

I'm not really sure if that's a convention. Honestly, I don't really see the point of keeping the old code. I did keep all old doctests, which I think is important.

I'm glad you know how this feels.  Does Sage use the pari splitting field implementation now?

Of course!   There may be some benefit in keeping an independent implementation though, in case of bugs being found later.

Agreed -- and looking more closely I see that you did move the tests for the special cases j=0, 1728 and not *re*move them.  Thanks.

I will ask the pari-devs about the other points.

`git` tip: do you know about the `--patience` option?

The default diff algorithm in `git` tries to minimize the number of changes. But this isn't really what you want, since it might match a random empty line from the old code with an unrelated empty line from the new code. With the `--patience` option, `git` uses a different algorithm which doesn't suffer from this: even though the `diff` will be larger, logical blocks will be kept together.

For p=3, this is the function F3xq_ellcardj().
The curve and its twists become identical in some degree-6 extension
of the base field so we can identify the twist by using Kummer theory.
The formula is not straightforward, but optimal for efficiency.

For p=2, I never finished to compute the equivalent formula
(I think one need a degree 24 extension).
So instead we use random points to discriminate between the possible
candidates given by Deuring. This is done in F2xq_ellcard().

I wrote about one-sixth of the formula. If you know about the complete
formula in this case, please tell me!

We do not always do it, because computing minimal polynomial was
quite slow. Quite recently we have added faster methods to compute the
minimal polynomial so we can revisit this point.

Practical example with this would be welcome.

Bill.

I also sort of feel it might be useful to keep the old Sage point counting code (exhaustive/bsgs/special j's), modify the _pari version and keep the wrapper dealing with field of definition and special j's.

With this sort of code it is always better to be able to double check results btw two independent implementations.

I would still suggest we keep John's code even though it's not used by default.
It could still be used to double check PARI/GP results in doctests.

I agree with jpflori that keeping the old code as something to compare with if bugs arise is a good idea.  This also means that we can check to see if the j-invariant is in a subfield of the base field when selecting the algorithm.
