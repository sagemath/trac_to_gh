I thought we had a convention for situations like this, that a Sage-only implementation could be kept and used if some parameter 'algorithm' was set?  The parameter could be 'pari' by default.

For the record, I totally understand that. I had the same feeling when the PARI people implemented splitting field for polynomials over QQ which completely outperformed my implementation.

However, I consider it a "fact of life" that old code has to make place for new and better code.

I'm not really sure if that's a convention. Honestly, I don't really see the point of keeping the old code. I did keep all old doctests, which I think is important.

I'm glad you know how this feels.  Does Sage use the pari splitting field implementation now?

Of course!   There may be some benefit in keeping an independent implementation though, in case of bugs being found later.

Agreed -- and looking more closely I see that you did move the tests for the special cases j=0, 1728 and not *re*move them.  Thanks.

I will ask the pari-devs about the other points.

`git` tip: do you know about the `--patience` option?

The default diff algorithm in `git` tries to minimize the number of changes. But this isn't really what you want, since it might match a random empty line from the old code with an unrelated empty line from the new code. With the `--patience` option, `git` uses a different algorithm which doesn't suffer from this: even though the `diff` will be larger, logical blocks will be kept together.

I emailed Bill and Karim, CC-ing you, and this was their reply (last December):

For p=3, this is the function F3xq_ellcardj().
The curve and its twists become identical in some degree-6 extension
of the base field so we can identify the twist by using Kummer theory.
The formula is not straightforward, but optimal for efficiency.

For p=2, I never finished to compute the equivalent formula
(I think one need a degree 24 extension).
So instead we use random points to discriminate between the possible
candidates given by Deuring. This is done in F2xq_ellcard().

I wrote about one-sixth of the formula. If you know about the complete
formula in this case, please tell me!

We do not always do it, because computing minimal polynomial was
quite slow. Quite recently we have added faster methods to compute the
minimal polynomial so we can revisit this point.

Practical example with this would be welcome.

Cheers,
Bill.

<a id='comment:48'></a>The only remaining questions are:

1. What to do with the old code (mostly written by John Cremona I think).

2. Do we need to implement the "smaller field of definition of the `j`-invariant" trick? As far as I can tell, this is the only optimization which is in the Sage code but not in PARI/GP.

I agree with jpflori that keeping the old code as something to compare with if bugs arise is a good idea.  This also means that we can check to see if the j-invariant is in a subfield of the base field when selecting the algorithm.
