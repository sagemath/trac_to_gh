```
Keywords: polynomial division

As reported on sage-devel, the following is incorrect:

```
sage: F = GF(47)
sage: x = polygen(F)
sage: u = F(1)
sage: x//u
0
```
since `x//u` should give the quotient after dividing x by u.   

This is fixed by #2034, so this ticket just adds a doctest.

Could you be more careful with

```
sage: 1 // x
0
```
and actually test the parent of the "0" you got?
