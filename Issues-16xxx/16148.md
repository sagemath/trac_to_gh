In order to speed up Cythonization, we should use a cache. Ticket #15430 tried to make this the default, but due to some bug, it never actually worked.

Besides this, this ticket also fixes the silly precision in timing output (`time = 2.35585808754 seconds`) and disables `stdout` buffering such that Cython's messages actually appear in the right order.

The cycache fix looks good to me.

I don't understand your comment about order, if cython messages are printed to stdout then flushing stdout does not change their order. If they are printed to stderr then unbuffered stdout is wrong, it should be line buffered to avoid half-written lines.

Cython mixes print statements with shell commands. Usually, if you do

```
print "Python message"
os.system("echo hello")
```
then the "hello" will usually be output before the "Python message" if output is not to a terminal (output to a terminal is unbuffered by default).

Where "we" is also Cython, not just Sage.

> Still, we should be using line buffering and not unbuffered mode to avoid truncated lines on the Python stream level.

How could unbuffered mode lead to truncated lines?

> Though the lower-level libc buffering is line buffered by default and that probably saves us.

I think it's the same level, Python doesn't do it own buffering.

Not truncated, but different processe's output would not necessarily be separated by newlines `1111222222111111\n222\n` vs. `111111111\n2222222\n`

> Python doesn't do it own buffering.

To be precise, it did until your patch turned it off. But `os.fdopen(,,0)` does not call libc setvbuf.

```
Cython.Compiler.Main.default_options['cache'] = True
```
is probably the wrong thing; it should be passed in `options` to `cythonize()`.

But essentially `cythonize()` appears to be broken w.r.t. this, since it does:

```python
    ...
    c_options = CompilationOptions(**options)
    ...
    options = c_options    
    ...
    if hasattr(options, 'cache'):
        if not os.path.exists(options.cache):
            os.makedirs(options.cache)
```
and one may end up with

```
File "/scratch/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py", line 739, in cythonize
if not os.path.exists(options.cache):
File "/scratch/sage/local/lib/python/genericpath.py", line 18, in exists
os.stat(path)
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, bool found
```
as reported on sage-devel.
