In order to speed up Cythonization, we should use a cache. Ticket #15430 tried to make this the default, but due to some bug, it never actually worked.

Besides this, this ticket also fixes the silly precision in timing output (`time = 2.35585808754 seconds`) and disables `stdout` buffering such that Cython's messages actually appear in the right order.

Cython mixes print statements with shell commands. Usually, if you do

```
print "Python message"
os.system("echo hello")
```
then the "hello" will usually be output before the "Python message" if output is not to a terminal (output to a terminal is unbuffered by default).

Where "we" is also Cython, not just Sage.

How could unbuffered mode lead to truncated lines?

> Though the lower-level libc buffering is line buffered by default and that probably saves us.

I think it's the same level, Python doesn't do it own buffering.

Not truncated, but different processe's output would not necessarily be separated by newlines `1111222222111111\n222\n` vs. `111111111\n2222222\n`

> Python doesn't do it own buffering.

To be precise, it did until your patch turned it off. But `os.fdopen(,,0)` does not call libc setvbuf.

```
Cython.Compiler.Main.default_options['cache'] = True
```
is probably the wrong thing; it should be passed in `options` to `cythonize()`.

But essentially `cythonize()` appears to be broken w.r.t. this, since it does:

```python
    ...
    c_options = CompilationOptions(**options)
    ...
    options = c_options    
    ...
    if hasattr(options, 'cache'):
        if not os.path.exists(options.cache):
            os.makedirs(options.cache)
```
and one may end up with

```
File "/scratch/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py", line 739, in cythonize
if not os.path.exists(options.cache):
File "/scratch/sage/local/lib/python/genericpath.py", line 18, in exists
os.stat(path)
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, bool found
```
as reported on sage-devel.
