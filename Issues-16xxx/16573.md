At the moment, the methods `Animation.gif` and `Animation.ffmpeg` will, when called without arguments, create a new temporary file in some temporary directory without telling anyone about it. Apparently, in previous versions the file was created in the current working directory, where the notebook would pick them up. But this is no longer the case. One can pass an argument called `show_path` to learn about the chosen path, or an argument called `savefile` to specify the name explicitely. But the version without arguments seems rather confusing to me.

Therefore I suggest to change the code, and have it return the name of the generated file. The `Animation.png` method already returns the path of the directory it created, so in a sense this would be consistent. Notebook users would see some feedback indicating what actually happened. In order to see the file content instead of its path, calling `Animation.show()` seems more appropriate. The documentation would have to be adjusted as well, since they claim that the generated file would be shown in notebook, which isn't the case.

I addressed this as part of my work for #16533. Later I split that ticket. So the changes I have now are based upon modifications from #16571. I don't expect anyone to review all these modifications before the dependency has been reviewed. Therefore I won't request a review just now. I'm mostly filing this ticket so my branch won't be forgotten. In the event that my underlying changes get rejected, one might address this issue here independently. The main reason I didn't do that is because I rely on [â€‹005b83f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/005b83f2379d786b88f9a6b194dd334c038ea8ca) to move the `savefile` manipulation to a point before the case distinction.
