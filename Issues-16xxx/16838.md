There are a number of issues currently with the `homogenization` and `dehomogenization` functionality. Essentially, what I'd like to see is that dehomogenizing and then homogenizing returns basically the same object. Currently dehomogenization is using `AffinePatch`, but homogenization is creating a new projective space every time. This causes a number of funny behaviors so should instead be using projective embedding. I'd like to see tests of the following form return `True`:

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=End(P)
f=H([x*y,y^2,z^2])
n=1
f.dehomogenize(n).homogenize(n)==f
```

```
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(QQ,2)
H=End(A)
f=H([x*y,y^2])
n=0
f.homogenize(n).dehomogenize(n)==f
```

This also requires having the `affine_patch` and `projective_embedding` play nicely together. Fixing this would also allow objects homogenized or dehomogenized from the same space to then live in the same new space. The same for points and currently there is no homogenization function at all for affine points. 

I've started working on this and just need to fix a couple more things.
