OK, once you confirm that the patch is not needed anymore, i will remove it from the branch.

To my understanding, the dependencies are set via the `build/deps` file, but it seems to be reserved to standard packages only. Volker, is this correct ?

That said, since those packages are optional for more than one year and many people want them to become standard, i plan to make a ticket for that.

Some optional packages do some dependency checking in their spkg-install, for example the p_group_cohomology package does this:

```sh
SMALL_GROUPS=`echo "SmallGroup(13,1); quit;" | gap -b -T | grep "13"`
if [ "$SMALL_GROUPS" = "" ]; then
   echo "It seems that GAP's SmallGroups library is missing."
   echo "One way to install it is by doing"
   echo "    sage: install_package('database_gap')"
   echo "in a Sage session."
   exit 1
fi
```
Will installation of pyzmq fail gracefully if zeromq is missing, or is it better to have a check like this?

Who confirmed that this was useless?  This will still not work on older Macs - see the **actual note that was in the SPKG.txt**!!!

```
   - patches/buildutils.patch: This patches the file src/buildutils/detect.py.
     It remove the option -arch for gcc which was broken on MacOSX 10.5.8.
     The reason to this is that Sage's gcc spkg does not build a compiler
     which understands the option -arch of Apple's clone of gcc.

And now that this is standard with all the big changes at the end of 6.4, it breaks some of them.  And since the machine I am currently trying to build Sage on does not have git, nor has git built yet, I will have to type this entire patch in BY HAND, or nearly so.

Me. My machine is a MacOSX 10.5.8. I have read that note in the SPKG. When I did the review, I confirmed that the patch was needed with the earlier spkg but not with the new one which I gave a positive review.

I am sorry for having cause you trouble today. Maybe we should add more documentation in the patch to re-add saying for what machine exactly it is mandatory. Because to me, it is not needed for 10.5.8 anymore.

I apologize also, because I was snippy in my comment.  I had left the machine compiling all night, only to discover this (relatively early) error.

I think that the question is in when they add these flags.  What do you get for

```
import platform
platform.architecture()
```
on my Lion computer (10.7) I get `('64bit', '')`.  I will see what I get on my other one.  My guess is that probably Dima's machine was already building a 64-bit Python (see e.g. [the SAGE64 flag](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html)), and that in the meantime maybe your 10.5 computer also is doing that, maybe we are building Python 64-bit by default or you are using `SAGE64='yes'` all the time on that computer?

When I reported that (cf the link to sage-devel in #13313) I tried that on an PPC OSX 10.5.8 machine, which is 32-bit all the way. I don't think I did build anything with SAGE64.
