Inspired by #16667, the following usually breaks Sage badly:

```
sage: x = polygen(GF(2^8, 'a')); alarm(0.1); x^1000000
```
This reason is that this tends to interrupt during a `malloc()` call, which can totally mess up the heap. We always knew this could happen, but now we have a case which is relatively easy to reproduce.
