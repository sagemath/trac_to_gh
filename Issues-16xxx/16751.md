Hi Volker,

that alone doesn't work yet. Wasn't Francois on the right track? The Singular config.log keeps saying

```
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:74:2: error: #error GMP 5.0.0 or MPIR 2.6.0 or later are required
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:78:2: error: #error MPFR 3.0.0 or later is required
```

The whole (new) config.log file is here: http://wwwth.mpp.mpg.de/members/jkeitel/config2.log

Reposting here, since apparently G00gle doesn't like it (meanwhile tried twice):

These shouldn't get picked up (in this case, only the header files matter anyway),
since $SAGE_LOCAL/{include,lib} come first in the -I and -L directives:

configure:8898: gcc -o conftest -O2 -g  -fPIC -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include  -I/usr/local/include -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lntl -lgmp -lreadline -ltermcap -lm -L/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/lib -lflint -lmpfr -lmpir >&5
In file included from /Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/fmpz.h:38:0,
                 from conftest.c:94:
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:74:2: error: #error GMP 5.0.0 or MPIR 2.6.0 or later are required
/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint/flint.h:78:2: error: #error MPFR 3.0.0 or later is required
configure:8898: $? = 1


It would be interesting to see GCC's verbose output (in particular, the list of
include folders) as well as the preprocessed source of that conftest.c, but I
guess it's not that easy to add the appropriate flags there.

It shouldn't at all.  You could move or remove them temporarily though.

Provided Volker's patch solves the issue, probably not worth the effort.

Otherwise I'd say it's a compiler bug, if we can trust what's in `config.log` (i.e., the shown command line leading to the failure).

In theory at least, the patch could of course break things on other systems (where pieces not shipped with Sage are located in `/usr/local/`, and in case that's not searched by default), but there are easy work-arounds for that case, and I think that'd be for another ticket if someone gets hit.  (Probably the buildbots will also tell.)

I still don't get why apparently `/usr/local/include/gmp.h` gets included although `-I${SAGE_LOCAL}/include` precedes `-I/usr/local/include`, according to `config.log`...

Jan, you may try whether

```sh

```
or simply

```sh
gcc -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include/flint -I/Users/kabel/sage/sage/local/include -I/usr/local/include -c conftest.c
```
also fails for you, in a Sage subshell (`./sage --sh`).

I've attached the [corresponding conftest.c](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket16751/conftest.c.gz).

Ah ok, thanks.

So it's pretty specific to "Sage's" GCC, which treats `$SAGE_LOCAL/include` as a system include folder, but not `/usr/local/include`.

One day we should [instead] fix the GCC spkg then... :P
