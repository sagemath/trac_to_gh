The degree is not the one expected (as there is no check that the dominant coefficient is nonzero):

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2),'z')
sage: R.random_element(degree=5).degree()
3
```

This was found in #16681

Hi Vincent,

why are you treating the degree 0 case differently? Since the degree of 0 is -1, wouldn't it be better to guarantee that random_element with degree 0 doesn't return 0?
That is, why don't you just remove these two lines:

```
if degree == 0:
return self(R.random_element(*args, **kwds))
```

Hi Jan,

If you have a suggestion, I don't mind that you do it. And we can discuss it. I do not find acceptable that you come and set your branch as default.

Now, concretely about your commit: `R.random_element(degree=whatever)` will **never** return the zero polynomial. So I would not say that it "works".

The new commit handles the case of `degree=-1` which correspond to the zero polynomial.

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

sorry, I certainly didn't mean to offend you and your current branch is a better solution.

However, what about doing one more check that `degree >-1` and raising an error if that's not the case? At the moment we have

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'z')
sage: R.random_element(degree=-2)
1
```
