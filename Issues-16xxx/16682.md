The degree is not the one expected (as there is no check that the dominant coefficient is nonzero):

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2),'z')
sage: R.random_element(degree=5).degree()
3
```

This was found in #16681

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi Vincent,

That is, why don't you just remove these two lines:

```
if degree == 0:
return self(R.random_element(*args, **kwds))

<a id='comment:5'></a>Hi Jan,

If you have a suggestion, I don't mind that you do it. And we can discuss it. I do not find acceptable that you come and set your branch as default.

Now, concretely about your commit: `R.random_element(degree=whatever)` will **never** return the zero polynomial. So I would not say that it "works".

The new commit handles the case of `degree=-1` which correspond to the zero polynomial.

sorry, I certainly didn't mean to offend you and your current branch is a better solution.

However, what about doing one more check that `degree >-1` and raising an error if that's not the case? At the moment we have

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'z')
sage: R.random_element(degree=-2)
1

Everybody works differently, so no offense at all.

I always assume that the user is intelligent enough... done in the last commit.
