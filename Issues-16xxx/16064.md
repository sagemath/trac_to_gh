From the Python 2 documentation [basestring()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#basestring):
    This abstract type is the superclass for str and unicode. It cannot be called or instantiated, but it can be used to test whether an object is an instance of str or unicode. isinstance(obj, basestring) is equivalent to isinstance(obj, (str, unicode)).
    New in version 2.3.
    This is not available in Python 3.

The tool 2to3 changes `basestring` into `str` (the only string type  in Py3).

There are 27 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

For unicode strings in Python 2.7 the change will not give the same result as before. See

```
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> s ='a str'
>>> su = u'a u-str'
>>> isinstance(s, basestring)
True
>>> isinstance(su, basestring)
True
>>> isinstance(s, str)
True
>>> isinstance(su, str)
False
>>> 
``` 
As we want a single Python 2 / 3 code base I think this is not the right solution.

You are right using `2to3` would be the better way, but the tool doesn't touch doctests and it will not fix all compatibility issues.

IMO we should change as much as possible (if it is not ugly) upstream to reduce work for `2to3`.
And in the long run we have to change it anyway.
Changes like #16442, #16529 and even #16071 (if we leave the `izip` part out) should be fine.

Let's skip this ticket for the moment and maybe replaced it by using `2to3` at build time.
