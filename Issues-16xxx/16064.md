From the Python 2 documentation [basestring()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#basestring):
    This abstract type is the superclass for str and unicode. It cannot be called or instantiated, but it can be used to test whether an object is an instance of str or unicode. isinstance(obj, basestring) is equivalent to isinstance(obj, (str, unicode)).
    New in version 2.3.
    This is not available in Python 3.

The tool 2to3 changes `basestring` into `str` (the only string type  in Py3).

There are 27 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

You are right using `2to3` would be the better way, but the tool doesn't touch doctests and it will not fix all compatibility issues.

IMO we should change as much as possible (if it is not ugly) upstream to reduce work for `2to3`.
And in the long run we have to change it anyway.
Changes like #16442, #16529 and even #16071 (if we leave the `izip` part out) should be fine.

Let's skip this ticket for the moment and maybe replaced it by using `2to3` at build time.

The patch looks fine. Testing is OK.

But in `sage-6.8.beta3` there are still `basestring`s in ` sage/quivers/algebra.py	` line 277 and in `sage/quivers/path_semigroup.py` lines 340 / 348. The are NOT present `sage-6.8.beta0` on which the patch is based. I haven't found out why.

Can you base the patch on `sage-6.8.beta3` and change the 3 remaining `basestring`s. Then I would set the ticket to positive review.
