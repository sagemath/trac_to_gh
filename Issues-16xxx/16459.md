Close as won't fix? `polar_plot` never gets its argument, since `fibonacci` isn't symbolic:

```
sage: fibonacci(floor(tan((abs(alpha+pi/2)^0.22))))
TypeError: unable to convert x (=floor(tan(abs(1/2*pi + alpha)^0.220000000000000))) to an integer
```
Apart from hobbling sage by equipping every conceivable function in sage with a symbolic equivalent, we can't really do something about this (perhaps document somewhere where newbies will look?)
