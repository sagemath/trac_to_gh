From [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/IgC78rcdO7c):

```
But other sums are simply wrong.

k = var('k')
sum(x^(2*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,oo)

gives

-1/4*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*x^(3/2)

but the answer should be sinh(x). 

Hmm.  That shouldn't be happening, though I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't turn out as easy as that.

(%i1) load(simplify_sum);
(%o1) /Users/.../Sage-5.12-OSX-64bit-10.6.app/Contents/Reso\
urces/sage/local/share/maxima/5.29.1/share/solve_rec/simplify_sum.mac
(%i3) display2d:false;

(%o3) false
(%i4) simplify_sum(sum(x^(2*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,inf));

(%o4) sqrt(%pi)*bessel_i(-1/2,x)*sqrt(x)/sqrt(2)

So I'm not sure why that would happen - maybe because of incorrect Bessel simplification?

sage: maxima_calculus('bessel_i(-1/2,x)')
bessel_i(-1/2,x)
sage: _._sage_()
sqrt(2)*sqrt(1/(pi*x))*cosh(x)

That gives cosh(x), which I think is what you meant.
```
I don't know why this would happen, but presumably it should be possible to track down without too much effort.

<a id='comment:2'></a>It's a problem in the automatic translation learning for `max_to_sr`. If we force it to learn about Bessel functions beforehand, there's no problem:

```
sage: var('k')
k
sage: sum(bessel_I(2,x),k,1,10)
10*bessel_I(2, x)
sage: sum(x^(2*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,oo)
sqrt(pi)*sqrt(x)*sqrt(1/(pi*x))*cosh(x)
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import *
sage: sage_op_dict[operator.mul] #as it should be
<ECL: MTIMES>
```
On the other hand, in a fresh session:

```
sage: var('k')
k
sage: sum(x^(2*k)/factorial(2*k),k,0,oo)
-1/4*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*x^(3/2)
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import *
sage: sage_op_dict[operator.mul]
<ECL: %BESSEL_I>
```
The problem is that the `bessel_I(-1/2,x)` gets immediately rewritten to another expression, so the default heuristics for `max_to_sr` fail. The remedy: initialize the translation of `%BESSEL_I`. This consists simply of adding the line

This should do a much more programmatic and hence more reliable job than forcing people to register the same information in yet another spot.
