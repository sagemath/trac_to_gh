Before : 

```
           sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
            sage: f = x^3 + x + 1
            sage: f.mod(x + 1)
            x^3 + x + 1
```

After : 

```
           sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
            sage: f = x^3 + x + 1
            sage: f.mod(x + 1)

My opinion is that it is better to raise an exception that to return mathematical nonsense (if only for "pedagogical" reasons)

It turns out that `quo_rem` does not always have the same specification (which seems bad in my opinion). Examples :

```
sage: R.<X> = ZZ[]
sage: (2*X^2 + 3*X + 1).quo_rem(2*X + 1)
(X + 1, 0)
```
So, here, Sage "silently" performs a partial reduction.

```
sage: RR.<Y> = R[]
RR.random_element().quo_rem((3*X+1)*Y + X + 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ArithmeticError: Nonunit leading coefficient
```
And indeed, the "generic polynomial" quo_rem (as in src/sage/ring/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx) advertises that an arithmetic exception shall be raised when a division by a non-monic polynomial is attempted).

As far as the current commit is concerned, I'd say a simple addition of

```
    mod = __mod__
```
would do the trick rather than copying the `__mod__` function.
Otherwise, as there is a `quo_rem`function defined, I would say we can rely on that, and let it raise an exception if it wants.
Note that you can already issue:

```
f % g
```
and trigger the call to `quo_rem`.

Great.
I would be happy to close the ticket as is cos it's a first step toward something better.
Completely fixing pow, powmod, mod, quo_rem and so one looks like it needs more work and thoughts.
John: would you mind taking this route?

Hi pbruin,

I made a case for `quo_rem()` implementing **euclidean division** in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/UVrx5CG4qA0/WUz2RItJtF8J Nobody complained (and John approved).

What you ask for can be obtained (as you suggested) by other means.

Note that depending on the ring, and on the implementation, quo_rem does not do the same thing. For instance, the NTL implementation of ZZ[X] does what I ask for, but the FLINT implementation of ZZ[X] does what you requested. This situation calls for clarification.

Note that `src/sage/structure/element.pyx` asks that `quo_rem()` and `mod()` implement euclidean division, or fail if the result is not mathematically defined... I think that this is fine (if anything, it may help students realize that the result is not defined !).

Sorry, I did not closely follow the sage-devel discussion and only realised I didn't like this approach after seeing your patch.

Actually I interpreted John's [comment:7](#comment%3A7) as saying that he was against raising an error given that there is also a reasonable answer that we can return without raising an error.  Maybe he can clarify his opinion?

> What you ask for can be obtained (as you suggested) by other means.

What I'm most concerned about is that examples which used to work now raise an error.  For example, I think the following examples (of the FLINT implementation) are mathematically perfectly valid:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: (x^100).quo_rem(2*x+1)
(0, x^100)
sage: (5*x+7).quo_rem(3)
(x + 2, 2*x + 1)
```
Is there a simple way to obtain these results after your patch?

> Note that depending on the ring, and on the implementation, quo_rem does not do the same thing. For instance, the NTL implementation of ZZ[X] does what I ask for, but the FLINT implementation of ZZ[X] does what you requested. This situation calls for clarification.

Yes, I agree that we should come up with a consistent approach.  I can see that **Z**[*x*] (in the FLINT implementation) and *K*[*t*][*x*] (for a field *K*) behave inconsistently and that this should be fixed.

However, I also think one should think twice before choosing a solution that fails in more cases, rather than a solution that returns a result in more cases.

> Note that `src/sage/structure/element.pyx` asks that `quo_rem()` and `mod()` implement euclidean division, or fail if the result is not mathematically defined... I think that this is fine (if anything, it may help students realize that the result is not defined !).

I don't agree that the result is necessarily undefined; that depends on what definition you use.  FLINT in fact uses a definition of `quo_rem(f, g)` which is valid for all `f` and `g != 0` (the one I described), and with your patch we would simply refuse to return this answer in many cases.  (Note that the current version of the patch does not seem to conform to the documentation either: you check for the leading coefficient being 1 instead of any unit, and you don't raise an error if the remainder is 0.)

Hi all,

In fact, most of my rant comes of out of the following: the name "quo_rem" strongly suggests euclidean division (at least for me). In particular, the QUOtient bit. Because of how the system works, the `quo_rem()` method is also available on non-euclidean rings, where euclidean division does not make sense (but where exact division sometimes make sense, e.g. over integral domains).

I thought that the "remainder" (which makes sense mathematically as everyone agrees) could be obtained by :

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: Ideal(2*x+1).reduce(x^100)
x^100
```
(and given the remainder, the "quotient" part could be obtained by exact division).

But it turns out that this is not always the case:

```
sage: Ideal(3).reduce(5*x+7)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: not a constant polynomial

sage: Ideal(R(3)).reduce(5*x+7)
5*x + 7  # <--- not what you want, and probably incorrect?
```

This is yet another inconsistency.

Lastly, let me mention that the NTL implementation of ZZ[X] already does what I thought was right (git blame tells dmharvey wrote it):

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation="NTL")
sage: sage: (x^100).quo_rem(2*x+1)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ArithmeticError: division not exact in Z[x] (consider coercing to Q[x] first)
```
This is actually where I copied-pasted the error message (and some of the code I think).

Anyway, I don't want to put up a fight about this. I don't care. I will thus retract the modifications to FLINT's polynomial (which will remain inconsistent with NTL). The fix to the "mod" method should still be accepted by everyone though.

I also suggest to close this one to get `mod` fixed and open a follow up ticket to unify `quo_rem` behavior.
