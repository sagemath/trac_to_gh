Do you want to wait on removing the deprecated Bessel things to there, then?  I guess that's my point.  (But not the little bit below about `prec`, that is okay to remove here.)
> > ... Also note that [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/functions/bessel.py?id=9db8c5c598ec9de953a33b14e531bee3c092c199#n1071) there is a small bit to be removed.

> Done.

And if you can still keep a doctest which does something like `gamma(6.)` that would be useful, as it seems to sometimes unlock inconsistencies on different platforms we otherwise might not know about.

```
sage: search_src("gamma\(6")
functions/other.py:758:            sage: gamma(6, prec=53)
functions/other.py:820:            sage: log_gamma(6)
functions/other.py:822:            sage: log_gamma(6.)
functions/other.py:824:            sage: log_gamma(6).n()
functions/other.py:997:            sage: gamma(6)
rings/rational.pyx:2920:            sage: gamma(6/1)
```
The following test ought to do it.

```
sage: gamma(6.)
120.000000000000
```

Somewhat surprisingly, given the attention to detail you've clearly given, there is still work to be done here - but easy work, I believe.

* In other.py, in the `__call__` method for gamma, there is still an import of deprecation which is now not needed.
* [This comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/7490#comment:7) suggests that perhaps 

```
sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1) 
sage: gamma(i) 
```
  should not work at all.  So either we should confirm it raises an error, check what "should" happen, or make it break...

Given that `e^i`, `ln(i)`, and `sqrt(i)` all fail in this case for various reasons related to embedding, maybe this should really be broken now.  Since

```
            if not str(err).startswith("cannot coerce"):
                raise
```
suggests that this is the only kind of error we treat, and then we just plop it in RR or CC as we can, I suppose we could remove that entire thing and do

```
return GinacFunction.__call__(self, x, coerce=coerce, hold=hold)
```
as the entire body of call or even remove it.  What do you think?

Right. It shouldn't work without specifying an explicit embedding in the `NumberField` constructor.

* make sure 13608 is still doctested

> * make sure 13608 is still doctested

Yeah, although something similar is tested in symbolic/function.pyx this is testing something very specific to exp, so that test should be kept, probably just in the same place as the other example, or in some generic tests place in the file.
> * check whether 2607, 6094, 10859 were doctested and remove those if needed

The 2607 stuff actually just removes the deprecated *method* for local max/min, but there is also the deprecated function it depended on which we might as well remove at the same time, seems weird not to

```
numerical/optimize.py:233:find_maximum_on_interval = deprecated_function_alias(2607, find_local_maximum)
numerical/optimize.py:234:find_minimum_on_interval = deprecated_function_alias(2607, find_local_minimum)
```
These don't seem to have been tested, though, which is good for this ticket.  The stuff for 6094 I found is unrelated to this ticket and not high priority, and 10859 was already all set.
> * see if just raising a slightly different error message in the number field case will be enough

Here is current status if I just remove the call method entirely like you did the others.

```
sage: gamma(i).n()
-0.154949828301811 - 0.498015668118356*I
sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: gamma(i)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 to Symbolic Ring
```
I guess we could keep the method and raise an error about embedding, or keep this one.  This is the only doctest failure in either directory, and we would want to rescue the tests from that module.

What do you think?  I hope it's okay with the multi back and forth on this.

Yes, because currently 

```
sage: Q.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1) 
sage: gamma(i) 
```
doesn't just work, it is doctested!  But the discussion above confirms it should not be allowed to work.

So, as I said [above](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16023#comment:27), we can either remove the call method entirely and then doctest that error, or keep it and make sure it raises an error about embedding as appropriate.
