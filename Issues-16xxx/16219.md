I have just been through the diff, and overall it looks good.

It seems a bit redundant to both import the algebras and link to their doc. We should find a better way to handle this automatically at some point. But that's for a later ticket.

The documentation improvements elsewhere in the algebra module is nice. Yet's it's orthogonal to the main purpose of the ticket. Next time, please make it a separate ticket.

Why not lazy importing everything?

Up to this last point, I believe it's good to go (assuming all tests pass).

Thanks for taking a look at this.

Concur.

> The documentation improvements elsewhere in the algebra module is nice. Yet's it's orthogonal to the main purpose of the ticket. Next time, please make it a separate ticket.


When I added the `quaternion_algebra.py` to the doc, it causes docbuild failures. The cleanup was just as I was going through reading the file in order for it to build.

> Why not lazy importing everything?


I lazy imported things that were lazily imported into the global namespace, so it wouldn't trigger an import when doing tab completion on `algebras.` (as what happens for groups).

There's a more trickier question of what algebras could we remove from the global namespace (it's not nearly as clear as it was for crystals to me), but I think that can be done on a followup.

Was this suppose to be set as needs_info? I don't quite understand why this was set to needs_work.

> Ah, also: at some point, we will want to point to all the Hopf algebras from combinat. But it's probably easier to do this once #16256 is done.


Yep, and it should probably be a subcatalog called `combinatorial_hopf` (or maybe just `.hopf` and include all Hopf algebras). Anyways, stuff for later and I'll take a look at #16256 soon.

I was thinking of lazy importing everything here right away. Maybe
using a flag "at_startup" to make the point that those should really
be lazy imported elsewhere as well. What do you think?

And at some point we will want to automatize the building of all those
catalogs. E.g. following the prototype Florent wrote during the Sage
days in Edinburgh that instruments `TestSuite` to build a database of
all parents with their category, from which we can get all parents in
a category by reverse lookup. I just created #17219 for this.

So do you mean you want everything to be lazily imported or do you want to lazy import the catalog? If you want the latter, this causes problems because then the imports are triggered on tab completion (you can see this occur with the `groups.<tab>`).
