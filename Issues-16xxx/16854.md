Replying to [@sagetrac-mraum](#comment:4):
> The code there would require essential work, though.

True, it's been bitrotting for about 2 years.

> The author of #3317, however, did not accept that adding a new standard spkg from scratch is not possible.

If we had made [pybtex](http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/) an optional package then it wouldn't have been any trouble by now...

Are you suggesting that this limitation justifies reimplementing bibtex functionality in Sage when it is already provided by a pure Python package that is trivial to add to the distribution?

> The code also introduces decorators, which slow code down. He argued that the slow down is minor and would have to be accepted. But the community does not seem to agree.

IIRC (and it's been a few years since I looked at the code), the decorators only introduce one string insertion in a Python set. That's one hash table lookup, which is negligible compared to what Python goes through for each function call.

Where do you get the idea that "the community does not seem to agree"?

> I thought about updating the code at #3317 for almost two month, and started twice. But it is quite different from the profiling approach that was taken by Mike Hansen. Overwriting code on a ticket is, I think, incompatible with the basic idea of Trac as we currently use it. So I opened a new ticket.

It might have helped to contact the authors on the ticket or comment on the ticket directly.

The profiling approach is broken for several reasons:

* the code used for different problem sizes is often different.

 Profiling a small example will not give you the correct information. If you are really working on the cutting edge of what is computable, then you don't want to run the whole computation under the profiler once more.
* you have to guess what is being used from the data obtained from the profiler.

 There is no clean way to associate citation information to functions this way.
* it does not allow tracking more fine grained information than function names.

 If a Sage function wraps several algorithms by calling an external package with different arguments, you cannot differentiate these.


I'd really like it if Sage improved it's citation capabilities and gave more credit to authors of underlying packages and the papers describing the algorithms used. Unfortunately, I don't think this is a step in that direction.
