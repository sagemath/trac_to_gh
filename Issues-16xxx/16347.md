Heeeeeeeere it is ! The new construction !

As a result, the MOLS table really took a lifetime to fill. This is fixed by caching the OA that Sage can build, a new feature from #16460.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Nathann,

I do not like the fact that we would have to cache everything. Could we instead cache the construction? In other words, have a function

```
@cached_function
def orthogonal_array_construction(n):
    r"""
    Return a triple `(k,f,args)` such that `k` is the maximum value
    such that Sage knows how to build a `OA(k,n)` and `f(*args)` actually
    return this `OA(k,n)`.
    """
```
Advantages:
- that function can be use to speed up both boolean and designs answers of `orthogonal_array`.
- we can remove the current cache from `find_wilson_decomposition*` and `TD_find_product_decomposition`
- it might be used later on to draw the tree of constructions.

I am not sure it is feasible, but without thinking too much, it looks like a good solution.

Vincent

You should not compute the largest k if you do not need to. If your function takes both k and n as an argument then it is Volker's idea.

It actually isn't a bad idea, if not for the fact that there is no reason why we should go that far to implement a caching mechanism in combinat.designs while the caching mechanism has nothing to do with designs.

The "clean/proper" solution is to implement a real caching mechanism for designs which takes k,n as input and answer accordingly, by only storing for each n the largest k that has been built so far, and the smallest k such that it has been proved that no OA(k,n) could built so far.

This is what I want to do eventually, but I first wanted to get the actual constructions in ..... This is not a definitive solution but it is not the moment to implement a caching mechanism either... There are features to get in, really ...

Nathann

P.S. : When I say eventually I do not say "in two years". I say --> as soon as all the current patches are merged into Sage, along with the 4 constructions I have been keeping on my hard drive waiting for all these patches to be reviewed.

Yes of course, this would be design-specific.

They look good ! Except for tho things :

```
Finds a wilson decomposition to build an `OA(k,n)` with one truncated column
```

Here one can understand that the purpose of the function is to build a truncated OA....

```
+    Then there exists an `OA(k,rm+\sum u_i)`. This construction is a
+    straightforward generalization of Lemma 3.16 of [HananiBIBD]_.
```

It is only straightforward when one tells you what there is to find `:-P`

> - I do not understand why you output `n` in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_one_truncated_group`
> - I do not understand why you output `k` in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_two_truncated_groups`


Historical resons I would say. You just changed the inputs used by Wilson's construction, I did it too before, and I did not think necessary to update the related functions ...

Good luck ! And show them 

```
sage -cython -a my_file.pyx # produces a html file whose lines are clickable

that's really cool !

Several values decreased in the table of mols.

Nope. The merge with #16430 just fails. f5069f0 is your commit before I started the review. I can dig to find what is the problem here but you should be able to find better than me what is the problem...

Fixed in the updated branch which rebases history. I will also need to rewrite the branches above this one.

I agree with the latest two commits but when it comes to the modifications made in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_two_truncated_groups` I believe that you are really making the code harder to read for almost no improvement. You add 6 lines to replace one, and this only to avoid calling `orthogonal_arrays` several times, knowing that all calls would answer instantly (they do the check that "n<=1 or k<n+1" each time).

When `n` is not a prime power, I expect that `orthogonal_array(n+1,n,existence=True)` is much more costly than all `orthogonal_array(n+1,n_prime,existence=True)` for `n_prime<n` combined (all straightforward 'no').

Really, that's not where the performance is hidden. The next patch improves things a lot, and the next patch on recursive constructions make things a lot worse. There will be profiling to do there, but really that's not where performance is to be found.

Then, why after the commit is it 30% faster to construct the MOLS table?

EDIT: and I have no doctest error.
