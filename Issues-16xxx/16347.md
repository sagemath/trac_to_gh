Heeeeeeeere it is ! The new construction !

As a result, the MOLS table really took a lifetime to fill. This is fixed by caching the OA that Sage can build, a new feature from #16460.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Nathann,

I do not like the fact that we would have to cache everything. Could we instead cache the construction? In other words, have a function

```
@cached_function
def orthogonal_array_construction(n):
    r"""
    Return a triple `(k,f,args)` such that `k` is the maximum value
    such that Sage knows how to build a `OA(k,n)` and `f(*args)` actually
    return this `OA(k,n)`.
    """
```
Advantages:
- that function can be use to speed up both boolean and designs answers of `orthogonal_array`.
- we can remove the current cache from `find_wilson_decomposition*` and `TD_find_product_decomposition`
- it might be used later on to draw the tree of constructions.

I am not sure it is feasible, but without thinking too much, it looks like a good solution.

Vincent

You should not compute the largest k if you do not need to. If your function takes both k and n as an argument then it is Volker's idea.

It actually isn't a bad idea, if not for the fact that there is no reason why we should go that far to implement a caching mechanism in combinat.designs while the caching mechanism has nothing to do with designs.

The "clean/proper" solution is to implement a real caching mechanism for designs which takes k,n as input and answer accordingly, by only storing for each n the largest k that has been built so far, and the smallest k such that it has been proved that no OA(k,n) could built so far.

This is what I want to do eventually, but I first wanted to get the actual constructions in ..... This is not a definitive solution but it is not the moment to implement a caching mechanism either... There are features to get in, really ...

Nathann

P.S. : When I say eventually I do not say "in two years". I say --> as soon as all the current patches are merged into Sage, along with the 4 constructions I have been keeping on my hard drive waiting for all these patches to be reviewed.

So, if you are willing to use these `@`cached_method everywhere or even the one you wrote in #16353, there is a need for a big **TODO** saying that it is here for quick-and-dirty speedup.

So let's not talk to much about caching right now, I will look at the construction.

Yes of course, this would be design-specific.

Yes, please do. But remember that there are many dependencies to this patch that have to be reviewed first.

They look good ! Except for tho things :

```
Finds a wilson decomposition to build an `OA(k,n)` with one truncated column
```

Here one can understand that the purpose of the function is to build a truncated OA....

```
+    Then there exists an `OA(k,rm+\sum u_i)`. This construction is a
+    straightforward generalization of Lemma 3.16 of [HananiBIBD]_.
```

It is only straightforward when one tells you what there is to find `:-P`

> - I do not understand why you output `n` in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_one_truncated_group`
> - I do not understand why you output `k` in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_two_truncated_groups`


Historical resons I would say. You just changed the inputs used by Wilson's construction, I did it too before, and I did not think necessary to update the related functions ...

You add 6 lines to replace one, and this only to avoid calling `orthogonal_arrays` several times, knowing that all calls would answer instantly (they do the check that \"n<=1 or k<n+1\" each time).\n\nWhen `n` is not a prime power, I expect that `orthogonal_array(n+1,n,existence=True)` is much more costly than all `orthogonal_array(n+1,n_prime,existence=True)` for `n_prime<n` combined (all straightforward 'no').\n\nReally, that's not where the performance is hidden.

I agree with the latest two commits but when it comes to the modifications made in `find_wilson_decomposition_with_two_truncated_groups` I believe that you are really making the code harder to read for almost no improvement. You add 6 lines to replace one, and this only to avoid calling `orthogonal_arrays` several times, knowing that all calls would answer instantly (they do the check that "n<=1 or k<n+1" each time).

When `n` is not a prime power, I expect that `orthogonal_array(n+1,n,existence=True)` is much more costly than all `orthogonal_array(n+1,n_prime,existence=True)` for `n_prime<n` combined (all straightforward 'no').

Really, that's not where the performance is hidden. The next patch improves things a lot, and the next patch on recursive constructions make things a lot worse. There will be profiling to do there, but really that's not where performance is to be found.

Then, why after the commit is it 30% faster to construct the MOLS table?

EDIT: and I have no doctest error.
