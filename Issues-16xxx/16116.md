This ticket organizes various improvements in order to get faster matrices over cyclotomic fields. The aim is to implement and compare three different ways to perform such computation:

- libgap wrappers
- generic matrix (`matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense`)
- the specialized inadapted class that is used by default now in Sage (`matrix_cyclo_dense.Matrix_cyclo_dense`)

Concrete tickets:

- #23704: getitem/setitem for libgap elements
- #23706: gap class for matrices + be able to change the implementation

Description from several years ago...

The multiplication of matrices with a (universal) cyclotomic fields as base ring could be optimized as the following profiling shows:

```
sage: def make_matrix1(R,a,b):
....:     return matrix(R, 3, [[-1, 1, 2*a],
....:            [-4*a*b - 1, 4*a*b + 4*b^2, 4*a*b + 2*a],
....:            [-2*a, 2*a + 2*b, 2*a]])
sage: PR.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = Ideal(x^2 - 1/2*x - 1/4, y^3 - 1/2*y^2 - 1/2*y + 1/8)
sage: Q = PR.quotient(I)
sage: elmt = make_matrix1(Q, x, y)
sage: %timeit elmt^2
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms per loop

sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: ae = (E(10)+~E(10))/2  #same value as a
sage: be = (E(14)+~E(14))/2  #same value as b
sage: m = make_matrix1(UCF, ae, be)
sage: %timeit m^2
100 loops, best of 3: 8.13 ms per loop

sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5*7)
sage: af = (F^7+~F^7)/2 #same value as a
sage: bf = (F^5+~F^5)/2 #same value as b
sage: m2 = make_matrix1(CF, af, bf)
sage: %timeit m2^2
100 loops, best of 3: 4.99 ms per loop
```

The three matrices elmt, m and m2 are the same encoded into 3 different base rings. It would be natural to think that the cyclotomic field be the optimal field to do computations, but it does not seem to be the case in practice.

Here is a univariate example.

```
sage: def make_matrix2(R, a):
....:     return matrix(R, 3, [[-2*a, 1, 6*a+2],
....:               [-2*a, 2*a, 4*a+1],
....:               [0, 0, 1]])
sage: PR.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: I = Ideal(x^2 - 1/2*x - 1/4)
sage: Q = PR.quotient(I)
sage: elmt_uni = make_matrix2(Q, x)
sage: %timeit elmt_uni*elmt_uni
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.46 ms per loop

sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5)
sage: f5 = (F+~F)/2
sage: m = make_matrix2(CF, f5)
sage: type(m)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_cyclo_dense.Matrix_cyclo_dense'>
sage: m.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over
Cyclotomic Field of order 10 and degree 4
sage: %timeit m*m
100 loops, best of 3: 1.98 ms per loop
```

Then, I disactivated the verification on cyclotomic fields on line 962 of the file /src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py to get a matrix_generic_dense instead of matrix_cyclo_dense.

```
sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5)
sage: f5 = (F+~F)/2
sage: m = make_matrix2(CF, f5)
sage: m.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over
Cyclotomic Field of order 10 and degree 4
sage: type(m)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
sage: %timeit m*m
1000 loops, best of 3: 251 Âµs per loop
```

The gain is significant. Is there a known use cases where the specialized implementation is faster than the generic one? If yes, should we make some threshold test to choose between the two implementations?

new version:

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hello,

I reformatted your example such that they fit in less lines (it can easily switched back to your original version if you do not like it).

I had a quick look at the code for dense cyclotomic matrices. The implementation is quite old and uses a lot of reduction mod p (even for multiplication). The code calls a lot of Python code like creating a finite field, creating a matrix space, etc which are relatively slow compared to a small matrix multiplication. Did you try multiplying larger matrices (i.e. 10x10 or 15x15)? On the other hand, I am pretty sure that some cleaning could be of great speed up. By cleaning I mean:
- declare `cdef` variables wherever possible
- let as minimum as possible `import` inside the methods
- ...
You can also do some profiling on the code (using "%prun" and "%crun"), see #17689 which is not yet in the current development release.

All right. I now understand better what I read! I see two possibilities.

1) [easy one] We add a test in the matrix space constructor:
- if the size is small -> use the generic implementation of dense matrices
- if the size is large -> use your optimized version
This requires a bit of benchmark.

2) [better one] Wrap pari matrices for small sizes or add a another multiplication on the current datatype that is fast on small matrices.

Matrices over ZZ used to have special code for small versus large.   I think now that variation in algorithms is mainly hidden by calling FLINT.      Look into it.

William, are you sure that the representation you used in `MatrixDense_cyclotomic` is the thing we want for small sizes? If that so, I would rather implement something for any number fields. I do not see why it might be different. Did you have something in mind?

In the present case, I would rather modify `MatrixSpace._get_matrix_class` to choose the generic dense matrices for small sizes and see if something break.

<a id='comment:14'></a>We also have a related issue:

```
sage: R = CyclotomicField(12)
sage: M = matrix.random(R, 40,40)
sage: N = matrix.random(R, 3, 3)
sage: %time K = M.tensor_product(N)

sage: R = NumberField(x^4 - x^2 + 1, 'a')

Wall time: 232 ms
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
```
Where the issue is coming from having a scalar times a matrix. Here's some profiling info of doing it over the cyclotomic field:

```
   594202    1.806    0.000    3.620    0.000 number_field.py:9200(_element_constructor_)
   594202    0.816    0.000    1.171    0.000 number_field.py:6628(_coerce_non_number_field_element_in)
  4184691    0.569    0.000    0.569    0.000 {isinstance}
```
This is nowhere to be found when doing it over the number field. (For very small matrices this isn't a problem per se, but it still is visible when profiling.)

So my conclusion is that we are doing something wrong with how we handle multiplication with cyclotomics in the matrix versus our generic dense cases.

+Description from several years ago...
+
+The multiplication of matrices with a (universal) cyclotomic fields as base ring could be optimized as the following profiling shows:
+
+```
+sage: def make_matrix1(R,a,b):
+....:     return matrix(R, 3, [[-1, 1, 2*a],
+....:            [-4*a*b - 1, 4*a*b + 4*b^2, 4*a*b + 2*a],
+....:            [-2*a, 2*a + 2*b, 2*a]])
+sage: PR.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
+sage: I = Ideal(x^2 - 1/2*x - 1/4, y^3 - 1/2*y^2 - 1/2*y + 1/8)
+sage: Q = PR.quotient(I)
+sage: elmt = make_matrix1(Q, x, y)
+sage: %timeit elmt^2
+1000 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms per loop
+
+sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
+sage: ae = (E(10)+~E(10))/2  #same value as a
+sage: be = (E(14)+~E(14))/2  #same value as b
+sage: m = make_matrix1(UCF, ae, be)
+sage: %timeit m^2
+100 loops, best of 3: 8.13 ms per loop
+
+sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5*7)
+sage: af = (F^7+~F^7)/2 #same value as a
+sage: bf = (F^5+~F^5)/2 #same value as b
+sage: m2 = make_matrix1(CF, af, bf)
+sage: %timeit m2^2
+100 loops, best of 3: 4.99 ms per loop
+```
+
+The three matrices elmt, m and m2 are the same encoded into 3 different base rings. It would be natural to think that the cyclotomic field be the optimal field to do computations, but it does not seem to be the case in practice.
+
+Here is a univariate example.
+
+```
+sage: def make_matrix2(R, a):
+....:     return matrix(R, 3, [[-2*a, 1, 6*a+2],
+....:               [-2*a, 2*a, 4*a+1],
+....:               [0, 0, 1]])
+sage: PR.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
+sage: I = Ideal(x^2 - 1/2*x - 1/4)
+sage: Q = PR.quotient(I)
+sage: elmt_uni = make_matrix2(Q, x)
+sage: %timeit elmt_uni*elmt_uni
+1000 loops, best of 3: 1.46 ms per loop
+
+sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5)
+sage: f5 = (F+~F)/2
+sage: m = make_matrix2(CF, f5)
+sage: type(m)
+<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_cyclo_dense.Matrix_cyclo_dense'>
+sage: m.parent()
+Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over
+Cyclotomic Field of order 10 and degree 4
+sage: %timeit m*m
+100 loops, best of 3: 1.98 ms per loop
+```
+
+Then, I disactivated the verification on cyclotomic fields on line 962 of the file /src/sage/matrix/matrix_space.py to get a matrix_generic_dense instead of matrix_cyclo_dense.
+
+```
+sage: CF.<F> = CyclotomicField(2*5)
+sage: f5 = (F+~F)/2
+sage: m = make_matrix2(CF, f5)
+sage: m.parent()
+Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over
+Cyclotomic Field of order 10 and degree 4
+sage: type(m)
+<type 'sage.matrix.matrix_generic_dense.Matrix_generic_dense'>
+sage: %timeit m*m
+1000 loops, best of 3: 251 Âµs per loop
+```
+
+The gain is significant. Is there a known use cases where the specialized implementation is faster than the generic one? If yes, should we make some threshold test to choose between the two implementations?
