Defect because there is no Sage binding for a result returned by Maxima:

```
sage: hypergeometric([-1/2,1/2],[2],4).simplify_hypergeometric()
1/2*I*sqrt(3)*assoc_legendre_p(1/2, -1, -5/3)
sage: assoc_legendre_p
...
NameError: name 'assoc_legendre_p' is not defined
```

Existing numeric functions are `legendre_P`, `legendre_Q`, `gen_legendre_P`, and `gen_legendre_Q` which correspond to P(n,x) / Q(n,x) and associated Legendre P(n,m,x) / Q(n,m,x).

They should be made symbolic. FLINT has fast code for P(n,x).

Hi!

Good to see that someone else is working on making the orthogonal polynomials symbolic, since my research interests shifted heavily in the past years.

A good read on Legendre polynomials is also the bible for ortho polys: Abramowitz and Stegun [http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_331.htm](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_331.htm)

There you will find also much information on special values and other properties.
I currently have some time left and can help with one thing or the other if you like,

Hi!

You won't have luck to find an equivalent recursion algorithm for Legendre Polynomials, since the recursion algorithm for Chebyshev Polynomials uses the fact that cheby polynomials are cosines in disguise, and thus one is able to build Cheby polyis in O(log N) time. For Legendre polynomials you have to use the classic recursion formula given in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials#Recursive_definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials#Recursive_definition)

I am not sure about the derivatives. For `P(3,2,x).diff(x)` I get `-45*x^2 + 15` (Wolfram agrees) while with your formula (lines 2377-2395 of the patch) I get (after simplification) `-45*x^2 - 15`.

Update: what's your reference there?

It seems you are right. from Gradshteyn-Ryzhik p.1004 formula 8.731-1 we have the relation

```
P(n,m,x).diff(x) = ((n+1-m)*P(n+1,m,x)-(n+1)*x*P(n,m,x))/(x**2-1)
```
The same relation holds for gen_legendre_Q

I suppose that's an copy/paste/rewrite mistake from my side.

Also, your recursive functions for `Q(n,x)` and `Q(n,m,x)` appear to be wrong:

```
sage: legendre_Q.eval_recursive(2,x).subs(x=3)
13/2*I*pi + 13/2*log(2) - 9/2
sage: legendre_Q.eval_recursive(2,x).subs(x=3).n()
0.00545667363964419 + 20.4203522483337*I
sage: legendre_Q(2,3.)
0.00545667363964451 - 20.4203522483337*I
```
The latter result from mpmath is supported by Wolfram.

As to `Q(n,m,x)`:

```
sage: gen_legendre_Q(2,1,x).subs(x=3)
-1/8*sqrt(-2)*(72*I*pi + 72*log(2) - 50)
sage: gen_legendre_Q(2,1,x).subs(x=3).n()
39.9859464434253 + 0.0165114736149170*I
sage: gen_legendre_Q(2,1,3.)
-39.9859464434253 + 0.0165114736149193*I
```
Again, Wolfram supports the latter value from mpmath (symbolic as `(25 i)/(2 sqrt(2))-18 i sqrt(2) ((log(4))/2+1/2 (-log(2)-i pi))`).

Hi!

We have several possible ways out of this:
1) avoid recursion for symbolic argument for Legendre_Q and use another library (maxima, flint, sympy ... ) for evaluation.
2) Let it be, but avoid it as default method.
3) Maybe more elegantly: There is a more closed relation for legendre_Q (but it's not really a recursion):

```
Q(n,z) = ½P(n,z) ln((z+1)/(z-1)) - W(n-1,z)
```
with

```
W(n,z) = Σ_{k=1}^n (1/k) P(k-1,z) P(n-k,z)
```
(Gradshteyn-Ryzhik p 1019f)

Maybe we could find an recursion for W(n,z)

Hope this could be of some use

Edit there should be a recursion since W(n,z) is the convolution of aseries of   holonomic functions, and if I remeber correctly there is an theorem saying that convolutions of holonomic functions are also holonomic, thus should have a recursion.

Edit: The above mentioned relation can also be found here: [http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_334.htm](http://people.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_334.htm)

I think there must be another different formula, because Wolfram has this for `Q(2,x)`:

```
sage: ((3*x^2-1)/2*(log(x+1)-log(1-x))/2-3*x/2).subs(x=3)
-13/2*I*pi + 13/2*log(4) - 13/2*log(2) - 9/2
sage: ((3*x^2-1)/2*(log(x+1)-log(1-x))/2-3*x/2).subs(x=3).n()
0.00545667363964419 - 20.4203522483337*I
```
which yields the correct value without use of `conjugate`.

The first few `Q(n,x)` from Wolfram are:

```
Q(0,x) = 1/2 log(x+1)-1/2 log(1-x)
Q(1,x) = x (1/2 log(x+1)-1/2 log(1-x))-1
Q(2,x) = 1/2 (3 x^2-1) (1/2 log(x+1)-1/2 log(1-x))-(3 x)/2
Q(3,x) = -(5 x^2)/2-1/2 (3-5 x^2) x (1/2 log(x+1)-1/2 log(1-x))+2/3
```
which makes clear that instead of `log((1+x)/(1-x)).conjugate()` we should just use `log(1+x)-log(1-x)`, of course. Oh well.

Oh yeah it's again the non uniqueness of the representation of the complex logarithm

```
sage: log((x+1)/(1-x)).subs(x=3)
I*pi + log(2)
sage: (log(x+1)-log(1-x)).subs(x=3).simplify_log()
-I*pi + log(2)
sage: log((x+1)/(1-x)).subs(x=3).conjugate()
-I*pi + log(2)
```

confusing as hell ...

I think Wolfram uses the log(1+x)-log(1-x) representation simply by the fact that it is independent of the branch in the following sense:
Let log(x) = ln|x| + i*arg(x) + 2kπi and log(y) = ln|y| + i*arg(y) + 2kπi
then 

```
log(x) - log(y) = ln|x| + i*arg(x) + 2kπi- ln|y| + i*arg(y) + 2kπi = 
= ln|x/y| + i*(arg(x) - arg(y)) + 0 
```
I.e. if we have the same branch on the logarithm the module of 2kπi cancels out.

That means the formula isn't exactly wrong, it uses simply a different branch of the logarithm. But the representation of log as difference saves us indeed a lot of trouble, and as showed above is independent of the branch we use.

Nevertheless I think we should stick to the recursion with W(n,x), because from a computational view it is a lot better since:

1) The computational complexity is the same (solving a two term recursion)

2) we save computation time since we don't have to simplify expressions containing logarithms but only polynomials which are much simpler to handle and expand.

If Maxima uses also this branch of the logarithm we should make sure that changing the branch of the logarithm does not interfere with existing code. Have you already testet the complete sage library with

```
sage -testall
```
?

We should also ask on the mailing list if there are some objections with that. 

Personally I'm fine with both, as long as it is consistent, since using another branch of the logarithm is not wrong, but maybe not expected. (Maybe I programmed the recursion that way, since I compared it with Maxima that time, so that the output does not change)

I asked on sage-devel if there are other objections on using the log(1+z) - log(1-z) representation: https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/sage-devel/5_4Pr8GypUA
Let's see what the other developers think.

Sure, but they are not polynomials. It is necessarily wrong to use the class `OrthogonalPolynomial` for things that are not, strictly speaking, orthogonal polynomials if really necessary, but then there should at least be a clear warning in the documentation of that class.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A54):

I'm not sure being holonomic or not makes a big difference for a symbolic function. What do you have in mind?

(As for me, I would like to have an implementation of general holonomic functions in Sage at some point, but I'm more thinking of a parent entirely separate from `SR` and with conversion methods to and from symbolic functions. Symbolic functions that happen to be holonomic could have a method that returns their representation using a system of linear functional equations, and could use that to implement operations for which no better function-specific code is available.)

0.549306144334055
sage: maple(a).evalf()

I think the issue is that Maple uses non-standard branch cuts for the Legendre functions, so that the conversion to Maple is not correct.

Effectively, one of the `__call__` methods (at this point of time `OrthogonalPolynomial.__call__`) dispatches to the resp. `eval_...` method. If no match is found (and `algorithm` is `None`) `__call__` returns to somewhere in the `BuiltinFunction/Function` classes to either return a held object or call `evalf`.

It's just a natural category for special functions, corresponding to a D-finite series expansion.

No, there is no idea, I just haven't figured out why the `BuiltinFunction` mechanism won't give me the original `x`, so I klugded something in `OrthogonalFunction.__call__` triggered by `algorithm`. This will have to be fixed but not today.
