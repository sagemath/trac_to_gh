Currently if we try to subclass a Labelled*Tree and then construct a
subclassed tree from a regular one, all the labels are lost:

```
sage: LBT = LabelledBinaryTree
sage: t1 = LBT([ LBT([LBT([], label=2),
....:                LBT([], label=5)], label=6),
....:           None], label=4); t1
4[6[2[., .], 5[., .]], .]
sage: class Foo(LabelledBinaryTree):
....:    pass
sage: t2 = Foo(t1.parent(), t1); t2
None[None[None[., .], None[., .]], .]
```
We fix the problem.
