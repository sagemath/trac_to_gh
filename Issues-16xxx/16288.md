This fixed `_cartesian_product_of_elements` to bypass `_element_constructor` and other checks, and documented it; this is particularly relevant after #16269 which introduces more checks and coercion in `_element_constructor`. Timing difference:

```
sage: S1 = Sets().example()
sage: S2 = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: C = cartesian_product([S2, S1, S2])
sage: l = tuple([S2.an_element(), S1.an_element(), S2.an_element()])
```
Without the optimization:

```
sage: %timeit C._cartesian_product_of_elements(l)
10000 loops, best of 3: 22 µs per loop
```
With the optimization:

```
sage: %timeit C._cartesian_product_of_elements(lt)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 922 ns per loop
```


Depends on #16269

Hello !

Two questions :

1) Does this file belong to the reference manual ? `sage -docbuild reference/sets html` says that "sets" does not exist.

   a) If it does not, should it be added (in another patch) ?

   b) If it does not, could this `_cartesian_product_of_elements` function be made to appear in the doc, even though it is private ?

2) You change the meaning of an existing function. Is there any way to check that it is currently well used in other places and should not be replaced by "self" where it is  used ?

3) Shouldn't this method be removed and the two lines

```
          elements = tuple(elements)
          assert len(elements) == len(self._sets)
```
moved to `element_class` (I do not know where `element_class` is defined) ?

Hi Nathann,

Thanks for looking at this!

Replying to [@nathanncohen](#comment:10):
> 1) Does this file belong to the reference manual ? `sage -docbuild reference/sets html` says that "sets" does not exist.

Oh, right. Well from grepping around, it's referenced from
`src/doc/en/reference/structure/index.rst`, so that's alright. Maybe `sage.sets` would deserve a
document of its own at some point.

>    b) If it does not, could this `_cartesian_product_of_elements` function be made to appear in the doc, even though it is private ?

That you ask the question raises another one: should this method be
private in the first place? When I created it, I did not know how much
I wanted it to be exposed, hence I started with a private method as
it's easier to change this way than the other. I added a note about
this in #15425.

In the mean time, if you remember from the top of your head how to add
a private method do the doc, and cares, go ahead!

> 2) You change the meaning of an existing function. Is there any way to check that it is currently well used in other places and should not be replaced by "self" where it is  used ?

Pre #16269, there was no coercion involved. So this is just reverting
back to the old behavior, isn't it?

> 3) Shouldn't this method be removed and the two lines
>

> moved to `element_class`?

Yes, the two lines could possibly be moved down to the constructor of
element_class. However the method can't be removed. Its purpose is to
encapsulate how one can construct quickly an element of the cartesian
product from its components (which is different for naive cartesian
products and for cartesian product of modules), so that we can write
generic code on top of it (typically in the categories).

> I do not know where `element_class` is defined?

```
sage: C = Sets().CartesianProducts().example()
sage: C
The cartesian product of (Set of prime numbers (basic implementation), An example of an infinite enumerated set: the non negative integers, An example of a finite enumerated set: {1,2,3})
sage: C.element_class
<class 'sage.sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct_with_category.element_class'>
sage: C.element_class.__base__
<class 'sage.sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct.Element'>
```

Hmmmmm... Probably. To be honest I always hated the "structure" folder, because for me "structure" means "data structure". By the way the index of the "structure" document could also be reorganized.

I think that I will if I can find its entry in the structure document !

True... God, I really can't remember which functions call which others... `element_class`, `_element_constructor_`, `self()`... How many ways to do (almost) the same thing ? `T_T`

```
~/sage/sets$ grep element_class cartesian_product.py 
        return self.element_class(self, x)
        return self.element_class(self, elements)
```

So I guess it must be in structure/ somewhere ?... Okay I give up, I'm tired of tracking definitions of functions.

As shown above, it is
`sage.sets.cartesian_product.CartesianProduct.Element`, with just the
abstract class from categories plugged in.

Which by the way it does not have an `__init__` of its own, so we
could not really move the `tuple/len` checks down there.

I fixed one link. The other links like `Sets.CartesianProducts.ParentMethods._cartesian_product_of_elements` should start working once #9107 will be merged.

The doc could take some tidying, but that will be for later; enough conflicts with #10963! I'll just leave a note about this in #15425.

For me this is a positive review if you are fine with my last commit.

Sorry :-)

I meant: we thought about moving the convertion to tuple and length checks from `CartesianProduct._cartesian_product_of_elements` to the `__init__` method of the element class, that is `CartesianProduct.Element`. But this class does not have an `__init__` of its own; instead it just inherits that of its base `ElementWrapper`.

No big deal anyway.
