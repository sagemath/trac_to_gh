```
The class `Functor` and some of its subclasses define a `__repr__()` method which doesn't support renaming:

```
sage: F=IdentityFunctor(Rings())
sage: F
The identity functor on Category of rings
sage: F.rename('I')
sage: F
The identity functor on Category of rings
```
This ticket moves these methods to `_repr_()` so the standard `SageObject.__repr__()` is used, which makes renaming work at least for Python classes.
