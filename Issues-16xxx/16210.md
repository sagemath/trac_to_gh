```
sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(10)
sage: g.allow_loops(True)
sage: g.add_edge(0,0)
sage: g.is_hamiltonian()
False
```

This happens because in `traveling_salesman_problem` the call to `_scream_is_not_simple` raises a `ValueError` when the graph is not simple, and the same exception is raised when the graph is not hamiltonian.

We can use the `EmptySetError` to differentiate them, as we cannot optimize anything on an empty set.

Why not a `NonImplementedError` (with a shorter message)?

What is the problem with long messages ? They give more meaningful information.
