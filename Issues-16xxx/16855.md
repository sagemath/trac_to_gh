For efficiency and simplicity, finite fields should compare equal if and only if they are identical.  Ideally this would be accomplished by inheriting from `WithEqualityById`.  Since `FiniteField` is a Cython class and Cython does not support multiple inheritance, we implement this by copying the `__hash__()` and `__richcmp__()` methods from `WithEqualityById`.

I thought that the kind of memory leaks he mentions has meanwhile been fixed. IIRC, having non-leaking bidirectional coercion was the motivation of using weak references to (co?)domain and parent of coercion maps.

So, can you or Nils give an actual example of a leak caused by bidirectional coercion in the current sage version? Or could you point me to a relevant leak-fixing ticket that has not been merged yet?

Do we want coercions anyway?
Wouldn't conversions be enough?

I'd say the user ending up with two different implementations of the same finite field (with same defining polynomial) surely knows how she ended up there.
So doing nothing automagically is surely better than arbitrarly choosing one of the possible directions for coercion and pushing everything there, isn't it?

Of course if when using a given implem of the finite field, you may end up with a polynomial ring based on another implem, coercion is still needed.
But now that we make sure that different implems are considered different, that should not happen.

(I may be talking non sense, I did not look at the code yet.)

The following does not leak memory with the current branch, but does leak memory after applying the additional commit `fcc623fd` from the other branch:

```
import gc
for i in range(10000):
    var = 'a' + str(i)
    F0 = FiniteField(2^3, var, impl='givaro')
    F1 = FiniteField(2^3, var, impl='pari_ffelt')
    _ = F0.coerce_map_from(F1)
    _ = F1.coerce_map_from(F0)
    if(i % 100 == 0):
        gc.collect()
        print(get_memory_usage())
```

There is certainly a mechanism in place for caching conversions (as maps) that would lead to exactly the same memory leak. A coercion in one direction combined with a conversion in the other could lead to the same leak.

It may be that there are ways to have a conversion and *not* a cached map. In any case, however these things get solved, it's worth convincing yourself that no memory leak has been created via the usual test:

```
for p in primerange(<large>):
  <create fields with p>
  <exercise them (add, multiply, build polynomial rings over them)>
gc.collect()
```
and ensure that there is not a large number of finite fields still in memory (or just watch if memory consumption spirals out of control)

Those conflicts should be resolved by the merge commit from[comment:12](#comment%3A12), or am I missing something?  Ticket #17165 also seems to merge normally.

I think #16983 isn't in any beta/rc/final release yet.
The merge is trivial though.
I've just done it and everything is fine for me.
I'd prefer you to do it though as I've done it in a branch with other (non-related so I hardly believe it was the reason for confusing git) stuff merged in.

For some reason that field is not used anymore since the switch to Git.  I think that Volker advocates using `git log` or the release notes to find out when a ticket was merged (which I find unfortunate since those methods are less convenient than the "merged in" field).  Anyway, thanks for the review.
