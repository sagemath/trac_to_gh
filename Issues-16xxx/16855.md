For efficiency and simplicity, finite fields should compare equal if and only if they are identical.  Ideally this would be accomplished by inheriting from `WithEqualityById`.  Since `FiniteField` is a Cython class and Cython does not support multiple inheritance, we implement this by copying the `__hash__()` and `__richcmp__()` methods from `WithEqualityById`.

Do we want coercions anyway?
Wouldn't conversions be enough?

I'd say the user ending up with two different implementations of the same finite field (with same defining polynomial) surely knows how she ended up there.
So doing nothing automagically is surely better than arbitrarly choosing one of the possible directions for coercion and pushing everything there, isn't it?

Of course if when using a given implem of the finite field, you may end up with a polynomial ring based on another implem, coercion is still needed.
But now that we make sure that different implems are considered different, that should not happen.

(I may be talking non sense, I did not look at the code yet.)

A coercion in one direction combined with a conversion in the other could lead to the same leak.\n\nIt may be that there are ways to have a conversion and *not* a cached map. In any case, however these things get solved, it's worth convincing yourself that no memory leak has been created via the usual test:\n\n```\nfor p in primerange(<large>):\n  <create fields with p>\n  <exercise them (add, multiply, build polynomial rings over them)>\ngc.collect()\n```\nand ensure that there is not a large number of finite fields still in memory (or just watch if memory consumption spirals out of control)",

There is certainly a mechanism in place for caching conversions (as maps) that would lead to exactly the same memory leak. A coercion in one direction combined with a conversion in the other could lead to the same leak.

It may be that there are ways to have a conversion and *not* a cached map. In any case, however these things get solved, it's worth convincing yourself that no memory leak has been created via the usual test:

```
for p in primerange(<large>):
  <create fields with p>
  <exercise them (add, multiply, build polynomial rings over them)>
gc.collect()
```
and ensure that there is not a large number of finite fields still in memory (or just watch if memory consumption spirals out of control)

I've just done it and everything is fine for me.

For some reason that field is not used anymore since the switch to Git.  I think that Volker advocates using `git log` or the release notes to find out when a ticket was merged (which I find unfortunate since those methods are less convenient than the "merged in" field).  Anyway, thanks for the review.
