For #16533 I created a second branch so I could redesign the changes while keeping my previous work for reference. So I created a second local git branch, pushe dthat to the trac server.

`./sage -dev push` refused to change the branch associated with the ticket, so I did that manually in [#16533 comment:14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/16533#comment:14). Now if I push updates, `sage` tells me:

```
$ ./sage -dev push --ticket 16533 --remote-branch u/gagern/ticket/16533b
About to push the branch "ticket/16533b" to "u/gagern/ticket/16533b" for ticket #16533. However, your local branch for ticket #16533 seems
to be "ticket/16533".
 Do you really want to proceed? [yes/No] yes

#  Use "sage --dev checkout --ticket=16533 --branch=ticket/16533b" to permanently set "ticket/16533b" as the branch associated to ticket
#  #16533.
```

But when I try that suggested command, it fails as well:

```
$ ./sage --dev checkout --ticket=16533 --branch=ticket/16533b
base must not be specified if branch is an existing branch
```

This doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me, since I didn't specify a base, did I?

It would be nice if sage would suggest a command which actually works as suggested. And I would very much welcome some simple command to only change the branch associated with a ticket.
