Currently we need to ask explicitly to have NN be a semiring:

```
sage: NN = NonNegativeIntegers(category=Semirings() & InfiniteEnumeratedSets())
sage: NN in Semirings()
True
```

This would be a natural default.

There's also the `NonNegativeIntegerSemiring()` that could likely go/be merged too.

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

This seem now to be the case by default

```
sage: NN.category()                                                             
Category of facade infinite enumerated commutative semirings
sage: NN in Semirings()                                                         
True
```
so we should probably close as invalid ?
