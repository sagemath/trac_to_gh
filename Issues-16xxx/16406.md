Currently we need to ask explicitly to have NN be a semiring:

```
sage: NN = NonNegativeIntegers(category=Semirings() & InfiniteEnumeratedSets())
sage: NN in Semirings()
True
```

This would be a natural default.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This seem now to be the case by default

```
sage: NN.category()

True
```
so we should probably close as invalid ?
