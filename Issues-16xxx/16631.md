0.5

The problem seems to happen in `__div__` when inversing a python int, giving a python float ?

```
sage: good = UCF(1) / 2
sage: good.value.monomial_coefficients()[(1,0)].parent()
Rational Field
sage: bad = UCF(1) / int(2)
sage: bad.value.monomial_coefficients()[(1,0)].parent()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suspect it's coming from

```
sage: int(2)^int(-1)
0.5
```
and

```
sage: UCF(1)*float(0.5)
0.5
```
So there are two things:
- UCF should probably refuse to be multiplied by float (it refuses RDF)
- division shouldn't just multiply the argument raised to "-1" (or at least don't do that for "int", since there it loses valuable information)

The problem about accepting multiplication by float may be there :

```
sage: UCF.<E> = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: E(3)._acted_upon_(float(2))
2.0*E(3)
```
and even more deeply in

```
sage: E(5).value._acted_upon_(float(2.3))
2.3*E(5)
sage: E(5).value._acted_upon_(float(2.3)).parent()
Free module generated by The indices of the Zumbroich basis over Rational Field
```

Hello,

In #18152, I reimplemented the universal cyclotomic field using libgap (faster and more reliable). In that version the issue disappears. My goal would be to close this ticket as "won't fix" as soon as #18152 would be reviewed.
