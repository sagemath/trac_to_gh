Keywords: --optional --experimental SAGE_SERVER

The version of an already installed package may differ from what's available from a Sage package server; don't say "not installed" in that case, but show its version (whether older or more recent) instead, in a more readable form.

---

Not a perfect fix, but at least we don't forget any actually installed packages when just versions differ.

WYAI<sup>1</sup>, change `"Using SAGE Server %s"` to `"Using Sage Server %s"`. ;-)

Dealing with package versions is SFFT<sup>2</sup>.

Otherwise LGTM, but HTI<sup>3</sup>.

Hmmm, I'm not very happy with the (lengthy and potentially confusing) output of `sage --{optional,experimental}`.

Perhaps we could at least drop the banner and instead replace `INSTALLED:` by `All installed packages:`  and `NOT INSTALLED:` by `{Optional,Experimental} packages not installed:` (at your taste uppercase "all", "not" etc.).




We'll see whether I'll find the time to implement some nicer output, listing all available optional / experimental packages, and if appropriate, the *installed* version *next to each* (not listing packages that are installed but not optional or experimental).  ;-)

Minor issue:

In case one has multiple versions of an spkg "installed", the version shown is rather random (but still *one* of those listed in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/var/lib/sage/installed/`).

AFAIK we never delete files there, unless the installation of a *specific version* failed, so older or previously installed versions "accumulate".

(*Moments later:*) ... Oh, that's quite new (in `sage-spkg`):

```sh
##################################################################
# Remove install markers for any other versions of this spkg.
##################################################################

rm -f "$SAGE_SPKG_INST/$PKG_BASE-"*
```

(I tested by *faking* the installation of other versions of some packages, so at least `sage-list-packages` doesn't bail out if `.../installed/` got messed up.  And the above doesn't work for packages without a [proper] version, i.e., lacking the dash.)

Hello,

It is much better now! Some comments about the output (I did not read carefully the code for getting the values).

- Trailing whitespaces line 19 and 76.
- I would prefer use .format as it is cleaner, i.e. replace line 76 with
   {{{
   print "{:.<40}{}".format(fullname, status)
   }}}
- To be Python 3 compatible, it would be nice to replace `print X` with `print(X)` and `raise Error, "Message"` with `raise Error("Message")`.
