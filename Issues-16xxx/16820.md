It at least covers all 3-dim Lie algebras over char 0 fields (up to isomorphism); I will check when I get home what generality they meant (and put a reference if you think it's necessary).

Also for this change:

```diff
+        if hasattr(self, "module") and x in self.module():
+            return self.from_vector(x)
```
I think you should do

```python
try:
    if x in self.module():
        return self.from_vector(x)
except AttributeError:
    pass
```
For the `FromAssociative.lift`...well there's some ambiguity there as to whether we want to lift to the UEA or just some enveloping algebra. I opted to lift just to the defining algebra (which I forgot to change in the docs) as this seemed the most natural. We will also have to deal with subalgebras and a `lift` there.

For the tested methods, it was originally returning an element from a matrix Lie algebra, but through refactoring this had changed. This can be remedied by changing the 3 to 1, i.e.: `L = lie_algebras.three_dimensional_by_rank(QQ, 1)`.

I'm also not happy with the corner cases being allowed as all properties become vacuous.

Anyways, I'll make changes tomorrow as I will let Sage compile tonight when I get back home.

Does this do something different or is it just more pythonic?
I am worried about this try-except game as I can't tell whether the AttributeError comes from self.module() or from the self.from_vector(x).

The corner cases need to be allowed, and I've already caught at least 2 bugs by inserting tests for them.

IIRC, it's mostly just doing some linear algebra, going rank by rank, and using the constraint by the Jacobi identity. However I will add it.

It is more pythonic (and faster, but not noticably). You are the one who wanted the rule of 3s contract, and because of the category almost every Lie algebra which has a module attribute also has a `from_vector`. Also I'd say the failure is more graceful this way as if either one is not implemented, then it results in an unable to do the coercion/conversion type error.

Renaming which one? Also it's far from useless to lift to some enveloping algebra as you would want to convert between say, SGA and the Lie algebra.

Whoops, yes. Do `sl(QQ, 2, representation='matrix')` or one of the upper triangular matrix Lie algebras.

No, they don't have to be allowed. In fact, because they are the empty set, they aren't really well-defined to me.

A lot of Lie theory is just doing some linear algebra... Linear algebra does a lot.


> It is more pythonic (and faster, but not noticably). You are the one who wanted the rule of 3s contract, and because of the category almost every Lie algebra which has a module attribute also has a `from_vector`. Also I'd say the failure is more graceful this way as if either one is not implemented, then it results in an unable to do the coercion/conversion type error.


You're right -- fixed!

> > > For the `FromAssociative.lift`...well there's some ambiguity there as to whether we want to lift to the UEA or just some enveloping algebra. I opted to lift just to the defining algebra (which I forgot to change in the docs) as this seemed the most natural. We will also have to deal with subalgebras and a `lift` there.


So you have 3 different meanings of lift now:

- lift from g to U(g);

- lift from g to *some* associative algebra containing g;

- lift from g to a bigger Lie algebra.

I have no idea how I am to rely on a method which can do either of these three things depending on the implementation (and possibly on the MRO?). These warrant distinct names.

> Renaming which one?


Either.

> Whoops, yes. Do `sl(QQ, 2, representation='matrix')` or one of the upper triangular matrix Lie algebras.


Thanks. And you know what's funny? The try/except change actually fixed the == 0 tests...

but caused some new crap:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ, 2, representation='matrix')
sage: L(2)
[2 0]
[0 2]
```

This is not in sl(2)!

Although, this is tolerable due to how this version of sl(2) is defined (as a generate of E, F and H).

> No, they don't have to be allowed. In fact, because they are the empty set, they aren't really well-defined to me.


0-dimensional Lie algebras exist and sometimes you get them by quotienting or restricting. It isn't mathematically reasonable to exclude them.

`lift_ambient` sounds good -- now I'd just wish the other two lifts would have different names.

What do you mean by "not the empty set like the set of 0x0 matrices"? There is a unique 0x0 matrix, and it is strictly upper-triangular.

Yes, talk to you later, and thanks for all the quick responses so far -- they're very helpful.

Meanwhile, here is an enigma for other people to solve:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.three_dimensional_by_rank(QQ, 3)
sage: L in Modules(QQ)
True
sage: L.zero() == 0
True
sage: L.zero() == QQ(0)
False
```

Here is a problem with using `lift` for any kind of lift:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sl(QQ, 2, representation='matrix')
sage: E, F, H = L.gens()
sage: E
[0 1]
[0 0]
sage: F
[0 0]
[1 0]
sage: H
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]
sage: E * H
[ 0 -1]
[ 0  0]
```
But E * H should not be -E if it's really to mean the element E * H of the universal envelope.

Also, it's black on white (green on black?) here:

```
        def universal_enveloping_algebra(self):
            """
            Return the universal enveloping algebra of ``self``.

            EXAMPLES::

                sage: L = LieAlgebras(QQ).FiniteDimensional().WithBasis().example()
                sage: L.universal_enveloping_algebra()
                Noncommutative Multivariate Polynomial Ring in b0, b1, b2
                 over Rational Field, nc-relations: {}

            ::

                sage: L = LieAlgebra(QQ, 3, 'x', abelian=True)
                sage: L.universal_enveloping_algebra()
                Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x0, x1, x2 over Rational Field

            .. SEEALSO::

                :meth:`lift`
            """
            return self.lift.codomain()
```
The codomain of the lift has to be the UEA.

Don't worry. I'm again swamped in work, so the sorriness is mutual.

Forget about this part -- I've since noticed that you define sl(2) as a Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra generated by a subset, and since you don't have methods which compute such a thing exactly, there is no surprise that it accepts input too liberally.

There are very good reasons for considering it a one-element set. Matrices of size m \times n correspond to morphisms `R^n \to R^m`. How many morphisms are there from `R^0` to `R^0` (that is, from 0 to 0) ? One -- the zero morphism.

That's a good idea.

The Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra generated by a subset will, so far, have no UEA, since we don't compute its full ground set. But now you made me wonder if we really need the Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra generated by a subset... If we don't compute its ground set, and only let the user compute "inside" it, then why don't we just use the whole associative algebra as a Lie algebra? The generators seem to be useless...

Right now I'm going to leave the option to specify the generators when constructing a Lie algebra from an associative algebra. Once #17416 (subalgebras) is done, it will directly create the corresponding Lie subalgebra.

In [comment:103](#comment%3A103) and [comment:104](#comment%3A104) I reviewed the `src/sage/structure/indexed_generators.py` and `src/sage/algebras/lie_algebras/abelian.py` files, and corrected the minor errors I have found there.

Reviewing the entire ticket might be too much for me, but it would be great to have Lie algebras in Sage.

<a id='comment:0'></a>
This ticket looks in good shape to me, with clear maths (as far as I can tell) and very high quality code. 
I've just a few comments:

- The documentation of classes `MatrixLieAlgebraFromAssociative` and `LieAlgebraMatrixWrapper` is reduced to "Initialize self.", which certainly could be improved, even if the class names are quite explicit. 

- There is a typo in the reference [deGraaf2000]: "Mathemtaical" --> "Mathematical"

- Some infinite-dimensional Lie algebras lack of a `dimension` method:

```
sage: R = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: dim(R)
+Infinity
sage: L = LieAlgebra(associative=R)
sage: dim(L)
AttributeError: 'LieAlgebraFromAssociative_with_category' object has no attribute 'dimension'
```
  Btw, shouldn't `dimension` be added to `ParentMethods` in the Lie algebra category?
- Regarding Heisenberg Lie algebras:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.Heisenberg(QQ, 2)
sage: L.lie_algebra_generators()
Finite family {'p2': p2, 'q1': q1, 'p1': p1, 'q2': q2, 'z': z}
sage: L.gens()
(p1, p2, q1, q2)
```
  Shouldn't z be part of the tuple of generators returned by `gens`?

- The patchbot is complaining about "Python 3 incompatible code" in `lie_algebra_element.pyx`, namely the use of `iteritems`. Has this not been fixed by `from six import iteritems` because it is a Cython file?

- Just for curiosity: why are you constructing all Lie algebras by invoking the base class `LieAlgebra`, relying on `LieAlgebra.__classcall_private__` to dispatch to the actual subclass corresponding to the input? Couldn't you use a *function* `LieAlgebra` to do this, as we did for manifolds (cf. the function `Manifold`)? (possibly renaming the class `LieAlgebra` to e.g. `LieAlgebraBase` to avoid any confusion). A drawback of the current setting is that the inline documentation obtained from `LieAlgebra?` returns the `__init__` docstring: 

```
   INPUT:

   * "R" -- the base ring

   * "names" -- (optional) the names of the generators

   * "category" -- the category of the Lie algebra; the default is
     the category of Lie algebras over "R"
```
  which does not correspond to the actual arguments to be passed to `LieAlgebra` (because of the `__classcall_private__` mechanism) and therefore may confuse the user. If you want to keep `LieAlgebra.__classcall_private__`, a solution could be to set the `INPUT` section in the docstring of the `LieAlgebra` class.

Thank you for doing the review.

Fixed by adding a docstring stub.

Fixed.

Fixed. Really it should belong to the `ModulesWithBasis` category (see #22629), but I moved it up to `LieAlgebrasWithBasis` category for now.

I went the other way and dropped `z` from `lie_algebra_generators` since I wanted a more minimal generating set.

Yes, that is correct. I did some other small improvements from things I've learned about Cython recently.

Because this is both the main entry point and the common base class, so there is no reason to separate the two IMO. It also avoids documentation duplication. Additionally the main docstring is (or at least should be) the class-level docstring, which has lots of different possible inputs first as examples. I agree it is a minor drawback that the `__init__` does get included, but it is way at the bottom. However, the possible inputs are quite varied, so writing an `INPUT` block complicated.

I agree. Accordingly, it may be worth to change the documentation of `HeisenbergAlgebra.z()` to something like "the basis element z".

Still with Heisenberg algebras, we have

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.Heisenberg(QQ, 2)
sage: L.center()
AttributeError: 'HeisenbergAlgebra_with_category' object has no attribute 'basis_matrix'
```

Another issue arises because of the `m[1]` in line 136 of `heisenberg.py`::

```
sage: H = lie_algebras.Heisenberg(QQ, 10)
sage: p10 = H.gen(9); p10
p10
sage: latex(p10)
p_{1}
```

Thanks for these explanations.

But isn't it the point of a reference manual to provide an exhaustive list of all possible inputs? Maybe it is too much in this case; if you think that the provided examples perform a sufficient coverage, then it is fine for me.

Returning for a little bit of bikeshedding:

- "cosnstructed" in heisenberg.py.

- There is a bunch of TODOs in lie_algebra_element.pyx. Are they all still up-to-date?

- In lie_algebra_element.pyx, is `self == 0 or y == 0` really the right thing? I thought we had `is_zero()` for testing zero without triggering a rube goldberg machine of coercions.

- In lie_algebra_element.pyx, in class `StructureCoefficientsElement` method `cpdef _bracket_(self, right)`, why not switch the next two statements:

```
+                prod_c1_c2 = c1 * c2
+                if not c2:
+                    pass
```
Actually, is `pass` the right thing here, rather than `continue`? I thought `pass` is just a nop; or is this a Cython oddity? (Same for the `if not c1` a few lines earlier.)

It's better and easier to let it fail in the appropriate way and place. Errors do serve a useful purpose and going crazy in the doc doesn't help, especially when the base code is subject to change without notice.

It is an issue of comparing a string to an integer. I added a key function that fixes the problem.

The abelian Lie algebra in the category examples folder, where it is just a toy implementation showing basis features? It is not meant to be a full implementation, just to provide an example of a basic implementation.
