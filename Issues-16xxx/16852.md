Not my experience. I updated the sage-on-gentoo ebuild and it is configured with 

```
--disable-allprogs --with(out)-flint --with(out)-boost
```
and it finds ntl fine. Is it only a trouble to find it in a sage install that sets CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS?

He suggests using a test like the one used by linbox at http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/linbox.git/tree/macros/ntl-check.m4 for when no --with-ntl at all is provided.  Otherwise we can continue to assume that the user has given a sensible answer for --with-ntl which will work, as is certainly the case in Sage.",

> Right! I didn't try ntl 6.2.x you are right (face palm). You shouldn't need the mangled symbol to write the test, this is pure ignorance. Most C++ compiler vendors have agreed to a common mangling scheme back at the time the release of gcc 3.4.0. It is virtually unchanged since then. I don't know a vendor that doesn't use that scheme. It is even arch independent. What doesn't work without precaution is calling C from C++ without properly declaring it extern_C (or something like that), if you don't, the c++ compiler will look for a mangled symbol when C doesn't have any mangling.

I have had some more private correspondence with Julien Puydt.  He suggests using a test like the one used by linbox at http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/linbox.git/tree/macros/ntl-check.m4 for when no --with-ntl at all is provided.  Otherwise we can continue to assume that the user has given a sensible answer for --with-ntl which will work, as is certainly the case in Sage.
