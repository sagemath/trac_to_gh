Not my experience. I updated the sage-on-gentoo ebuild and it is configured with 

```
--disable-allprogs --with(out)-flint --with(out)-boost
```
and it finds ntl fine. Is it only a trouble to find it in a sage install that sets CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS?

This discussion probably does not belong here since in any case Sage uses an explicit  --with-ntl="$SAGE_LOCAL" which avoids the problematical AC_SEARCH_LIB anyway.
