Not my experience. I updated the sage-on-gentoo ebuild and it is configured with 

```
--disable-allprogs --with(out)-flint --with(out)-boost
```
and it finds ntl fine. Is it only a trouble to find it in a sage install that sets CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS?

Was that using the new NTL, i.e. 6.2.0 or 6.2.1 (yesterday's bugfix)?  I understand that the problem is that if you do not give any --with-ntl then configure uses the AC_SEARCH_LIB command from configure.ac to look for the specific symbol _ntl_gmul but this symbol does not exist in the new NTL.  And all (or almost all) symbols which do exist are mangled versions of C++ function names, which are unsuitable for this purpose (basically because different compilers mangle things in deifferent ways).

This discussion probably does not belong here since in any case Sage uses an explicit  --with-ntl="$SAGE_LOCAL" which avoids the problematical AC_SEARCH_LIB anyway.
