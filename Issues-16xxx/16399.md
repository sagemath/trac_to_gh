I feel like we shouldn't have to do an explicit ring change to do this. Plus we get (somewhat) different failures for dense versus sparse matrices:

```
sage: m = matrix([[1,2]])
sage: m2 = matrix(QQ, [[1/2,2]])
sage: m.stack(m2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: matrix has denominators so can't change to ZZ.
```

```
sage: m = matrix([[1,2]], sparse=True)
sage: m.stack(m2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

I have tried to look at the code. Apparently, one only tries to change the base ring of the bottom matrix. But of course, the coercion could be the other way, or there could be some complicated way to find a common coercion.

I have made a preliminary attempt, very incomplete.

Here's how to get a common parent:

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import get_coercion_model
sage: CM = get_coercion_model()
sage: CM.common_parent(QQ, ZZ['x'])
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
and since we're modifying cython files, we could probably use the cdef global coercion model from element.pyx:

```
cdef CoercionModel coercion_model
```

Given the syntax, `m.stack(...)` it makes a lot of sense to try and let the result depend as much as possible on m and not on "...". The error you get now is quick and it is clear how to avoid it. With coercion, you could get an unexpected base 
ring change of the resulting matrix, which might give erroneous results much later.

The example below gives questionable results, but the change you propose here would break the behaviour we have already:

```
sage: M=matrix(ZZ,[1]).stack(matrix(GF(3),[1])).stack(matrix(GF(5),[1]))
sage: M.base_ring()
Integer Ring
```

Clearly, the current semantics are *conversion* into the base ring of the first matrix. Changing that into *coercion* into a common parent would be a real change, and it's not clear to me the resulting semantics are entirely desirable.

I'm not particularly defending the current semantics either. I'm just pointing out you're proposing an incompatible change and for that to be justified we'd need fairly wide concensus that the change leads to significantly more desirable behaviour.

I disagree with this. That's just a pure syntactical thing, mathematically "stacking" could be seen as a binary operator.

I am +1 to coercion, but there could indeed be unexpected consequences.

Note: I hit the issue on this ticket by working on #17585. Apparently, the `basis_matrix()` method of modules with basis always returns a matrix over the fraction field. Changing this gives errors because of the issue here.

Looks good overall, but there are two things.

The first is could you keep the "returns a new matrix" part of the documentation? Since matrices are mutable, your proposed change makes the result slightly ambiguous to me as we could mutate in place and return `self`.

Second is about this change:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism.py b/src/sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism.py

Is this necessary for this ticket or is it suppose to be a part of #17585?
