Documentation for `is_graded()` on `posets.py` says "Note that every graded poset is ranked, but the converse is not true.", whereas `hasse_diagram.py` says "A poset is *graded* if it admits a rank function."

Somebody knowing area should check this.

Somehow relating to this: note in `is_graded` on `posets.py` should be removed, see #13223.

Actually it seems that `is_graded()` is not called at all. I guess it should be deprecated.

Some time ago (maybe 2 years), we (a few Sage-Combinat people) agreed on the following definitions:

A poset is **graded** if all maximal chains have the same length.

A poset is **ranked** if it admits a rank function.
A **rank function** f is a integer valued function on the vertices of a (finite) poset P such that
* f(p) = 0 if p is a minimal element in P, and
* f(q) = f(p)+1 if p \prec q is a cover relation in P.

What if somebody has really used `is_graded()` directly on hasse diagram, expecting it to say `True` if the hasse diagram is ranked? Of course nobody should do that, but instead use poset.

And on sage-devel list we discuss about moving code away from `hasse_diagram.py`.
