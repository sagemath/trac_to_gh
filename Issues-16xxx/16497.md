Running `make ptestlong` with CBC package installed leads to the following doctest errors:

```
File "src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst", line 442, in doc.en.thematic_tutorials.linear_programming
Failed example:
    p.solve()
Expected:
    2.0
Got:
    1.0
```

```
File "src/sage/graphs/graph.py", line 3215, in sage.graphs.graph.Graph.minimum_outdegree_orientation
Failed example:
    max(o.out_degree()) == ceil((4*3)/(3+4))
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

```
File "src/sage/numerical/optimize.py", line 777, in sage.numerical.optimize.binpacking
Failed example:
    all([ (v in b1 or v in b2 or v in b3) for v in values ])
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

The problem seems to come from `get_variable_value` method in the CBC backend that does not round its result when the variable is binary. Actually, the same problems exists for integer variables in both gurobi and CBC backends (at least), but no doctest detects it.

I added a doctest, not sure it is a valuable one. At least on my machine with CBC installed, it returns a wrong answser without the fix (both integer and binary cases), and a good answer with the fix.

It could be nice to have some buildbots running with some optional packages installed.
