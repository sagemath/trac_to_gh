Consider this a "transient" patch. PARI upstream has changed their stack-handling in a non-backwards-compatible way. This patch `public_memory_functions.patch` is what's needed to use the current Sage hooks for dealing with the PARI stack. A follow-up ticket could use the new PARI stack mechanism.

Yes, I know. In an earlier version of this branch, I had to explicitly add a patch and the "patching loop" in `spkg-install`. I left the patching loop since it makes sense anyway to have it.

I am currently in the process of upgrading this branch to the latest PARI.

As far as I know, PARI doesn't use native floating-point operations. They use custom arbitrary-precision arithmetic which shouldn't depend on the system.

The reason there is a difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is because their precision is measured in words: some computation which would use 96 bits on a 32-bit system would use 128 bits on a 64-bit system.
