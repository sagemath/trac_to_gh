> Wouldn't it be better as an external gp library (let say `$SAGE_ROOT/local/pari/`)? Morever, we ship version 1.3 and current version is 1.3.3 (see [http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/computel/index.html](http://www.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/computel/index.html)). Though the last version does not solve the issue at all (but at least the `src/ext/pari/dokchister/testall` script is not emitting any warning anymore).

Perhaps, but let's leave that for a different ticket.

As far as I know, PARI doesn't use native floating-point operations. They use custom arbitrary-precision arithmetic which shouldn't depend on the system.

The reason there is a difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is because their precision is measured in words: some computation which would use 96 bits on a 32-bit system would use 128 bits on a 64-bit system.
