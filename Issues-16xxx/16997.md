One question however: is the new patch public_memory_functions.patch something waiting for inclusion upstream? As of this morning it would probably still apply (I now have a live ebuild for pari and this morning master is not *broken*, not like 2 days ago).

Consider this a "transient" patch. PARI upstream has changed their stack-handling in a non-backwards-compatible way. This patch `public_memory_functions.patch` is what's needed to use the current Sage hooks for dealing with the PARI stack. A follow-up ticket could use the new PARI stack mechanism.

Yes, I know. In an earlier version of this branch, I had to explicitly add a patch and the "patching loop" in `spkg-install`. I left the patching loop since it makes sense anyway to have it.

I am currently in the process of upgrading this branch to the latest PARI.

<a id='comment:79'>Comment 79:</a>
For the `dokchitser` failure, there is some annoying global state (which is probably a bug) in the `computel.gp` script. For example, in the doctest

```
        sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
        sage: L = E.lseries().dokchitser()
        sage: L.num_coeffs ()
        156
        sage: L.derivative(1,E.rank())
        1.51863300057685
        sage: L.taylor_series(1,4)
        2.90760251490292e-20 + (-1.64772944938078e-20)*z + 0.759316500288427*z^2 - 0.430302337583362*z^3 + O(z^4)  # 32-bit
        2.90614059330736e-20 + (-1.64690098288532e-20)*z + 0.759316500288427*z^2 - 0.430302337583362*z^3 + O(z^4)  # 64-bit
```

removing the `L.num_coeffs ()` test changes the last results.

Volker, do have an idea which elliptic-curve/L-function related ticket could have caused this?

Historical reasons. There are various such scripts in `src/ext`.

As far as I know, PARI doesn't use native floating-point operations. They use custom arbitrary-precision arithmetic which shouldn't depend on the system.

The reason there is a difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is because their precision is measured in words: some computation which would use 96 bits on a 32-bit system would use 128 bits on a 64-bit system.
