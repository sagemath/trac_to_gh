Hi,

A first commit at `u/vdelecroix/16780`.

In the documentation of `brouwer_separable_design` case i) it would be nice to say **before** that you want to build a resolvable `OA(k-1,N)`.

I let you do the rebase over #16859.

Vincent

Yoooooo !

I agree with your modifications. This patch, however, will have to be rebased not on #16859 but on #16863 (which only needs a final check). Plus I will also have to merge it with #16859 before removing the "incomplete+resolvable OA" blocks.

In my last commit (at `public/16780`):
- added in the doc: in case i) `x=0`, we construct a resolvable `OA(k-1,N)`.
- the `l.extend([f(x) for x in R])` are replaced by `l.extend(f(x) for x in R)` (we win at least 2ms... incredible, isn't it?)
- `Exception` -> `RuntimeError`
- the size of a matrix is given as `nb_rows x nb_cols` and not the contrary

I would not say that I carefully checked all constructions, but I am confident since there is a lot of doctest. I think it could go to positive review.

Good, good !

Perhaps even twice that. Crazy.

Good good !

I object, but I have everybody against me. So I will not object aloud.

Well, each case is tested and the code cannot return anything wrong anyway as all results are checked before that. Somehow while the design code is always very tricky there is no risk to return anything wrong.

I added a small commit to repeat "parallel classes" in a sentence, but short of this everything is cool, and it can go. Thank you very much for this review !

It is hardly believable... the combinatorial design tickets were linearly ordered! And I just check that it is up to date with #16802. Could you point the relevant ticket for the conflict?
