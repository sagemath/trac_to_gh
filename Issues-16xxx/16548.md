At the moment, there is a `NotImplementedError` if `FiniteStateMachine._composition_explorative_` is used with a transducer with non-empty final word out.

Furthermore, `_composition_explorative_` could not handle non-deterministic machines.

Both is now changed by using `FiniteStateMachine.process`.
