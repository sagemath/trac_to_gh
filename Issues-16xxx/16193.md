The code looks good to me and seems to work as it should.

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1827.4 seconds
    cpu time: 12113.3 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 13685.6 seconds
```

Documentation also looks good.

```
Elapsed time: 673.4 seconds.
Done building the documentation!
```

Thanks, Travis.
