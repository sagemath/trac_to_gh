Currently, polynomials with unhashable coefficients ignore the `TypeError` their coefficients raise:

```
sage: K.<a> = Qq(9)
sage: R.<t> = K[]
sage: hash(t)
Exception TypeError: "unhashable type: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_ZZ_pX_CR_element.pAdicZZpXCRElement'" in 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial._hash_c' ignored
0
```
