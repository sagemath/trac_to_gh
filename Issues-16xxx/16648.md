Starting from current develop (6.3beta5), builds cleanly after make distclean, passes make ptestlong with "All tests passed".

Unless there are more python-specific tests I'm not aware of. it seems good.

I'm afraid you're right (consistency is not a fully solved problem in statistics:-). However, since my knowledge of python is quite limited I thought that another reviewer, more versed in Python's mysteries (a. k. a. corner cases) should re-review this, without bothering with the basics I've covered. And **(s)he** should be listed as the (main) reviewer.
