This is from #13125, (comment 22):

...it seems to fail only when comparing to zero (OSX 10.7.5):

```
sage: filter(lambda x: RLF(x) < -oo, range(-10,10))
[0]
sage: filter(lambda x: RLF(float(x)/3) < -oo, range(-10,10))
[0]
```
while on Linux I get:

```
sage: filter(lambda x: RLF(x) < -oo, range(-10,10))
[]
sage: filter(lambda x: RLF(float(x)/3) < -oo, range(-10,10))
[]
```
