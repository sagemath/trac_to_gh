from the discussion in #15438:

to make the input of all the code bounds coherent we should name some new functions, deprecate the old ones, and make sure that all the inputs follow the same pattern.

Hello,

Why would you import such stuff in the global namespace ? It is a complete nonsense. I would rather **remove** all of `codesize_upper_bound`, `singleton_bound_asymp`, `plotkin_bound_asymp`, `elias_bound_asymp` and `mrrw1_bound_asymp` from the global namespace. First of all, some of these names are not fully expanded as they should be. Most importantly, I think that most of the users will not use that at all and can not even guess what it could be.

In order to have a clean interface, I strongly suggest to prefix all of these with the namespace `codes` (as it is the case with `designs` for example). In other words

```
sage: codes.bounds.plotkin(10,2,3)
192
sage: codes.bounds.elias(10,2,3)
232
```

That way, to have access to all bounds for codes you would just have to do

```
sage: codes.bounds.<TAB>
```
which is much more natural.

Bounds are not only of interest for codes, right? So please clean it up!

Vincent
