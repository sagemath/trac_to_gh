from the discussion in #15438:

to make the input of all the code bounds coherent we should name some new functions, deprecate the old ones, and make sure that all the inputs follow the same pattern.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Hello,

Why would you import such stuff in the global namespace ? It is a complete nonsense. I would rather **remove** all of `codesize_upper_bound`, `singleton_bound_asymp`, `plotkin_bound_asymp`, `elias_bound_asymp` and `mrrw1_bound_asymp` from the global namespace. First of all, some of these names are not fully expanded as they should be. Most importantly, I think that most of the users will not use that at all and can not even guess what it could be.

In order to have a clean interface, I strongly suggest to prefix all of these with the namespace `codes` (as it is the case with `designs` for example). In other words

```
sage: codes.bounds.plotkin(10,2,3)
192
sage: codes.bounds.elias(10,2,3)
232
```

That way, to have access to all bounds for codes you would just have to do

```
sage: codes.bounds.<TAB>
```
which is much more natural.

Bounds are not only of interest for codes, right? So please clean it up!

Vincent
