In `sage-env`, we currently have:

```sh
# Mac OS X-specific setup
if [ `uname` = "Darwin" ]; then
    # set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET -- if set incorrectly, this can
    # cause lots of random "Abort trap" issues on OSX. see trac
    # #7095 for an example.
    MACOSX_VERSION=`uname -r | awk -F. '{print $1}'`
    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4]
    export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
fi
```

With **binary** distributions of Sage, e.g. when trying to install an optional spkg, this can lead to errors like

```
configure:3166: checking whether the C compiler works
configure:3188: gcc    conftest.c  >&5
ld: library not found for -lcrt1.10.6.o
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
configure:3192: $? = 1
configure:3230: result: no
```
hidden in `config.log`, the visible `configure` error message being

```
checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in `/Applications/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/<package>/src':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
See `config.log' for more details
```

At least as a work-around, the user should be able to set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to some other value (e.g. `10.4`) to get past such errors.

Setting a different target may make sense for developers (using Sage built from source) as well.
