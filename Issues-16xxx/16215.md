sage: Graph([(0,1),(0,1)],multiedges=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Non-multigraph input dict has multiple edges (0,1)
sage: DiGraph([(0,1),(0,1)],multiedges=False)

The first message is much clearer `:-P`

Could you instead replace

```
choice([v for v in data[u] if data[u].count(v) > 1])
```
with

```
(v for v in data[u] if data[u].count(v) > 1).next()
```
or anything similar. The function `choice` involves some randomness that is useless here.
