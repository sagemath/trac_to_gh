<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Volker, 

Sorry to be nitpicking, but the docstring should be accordingly modified to expose the fact there are three options as opposed to just the two mentioned in:

```
A magic command to switch between simple display and ASCII art display.
 
- ``args`` -- string. The mode (``ascii_art`` (and optionally a ``width``) or 
``simple``)
```

--Kannappan.
