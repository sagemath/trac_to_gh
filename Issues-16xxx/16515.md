Any number in RealDoubleField compares equal to Python's floating-point NaN (which is not even true of NaN itself):

```
sage: nan = float('nan')
sage: RDF(123) == nan
True
sage: nan == nan
False
```

This bit me quite easily: I used a Python script that converted a number to RDF (imported from Sage) to take advantage of a built-in method, did more calculations with it, and compared it with each of a sequence of numbers that included a NaN value, which spuriously returned True.

**Keywords:** RDF RealDoubleField float NaN equal number
