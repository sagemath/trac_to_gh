In 6.3.beta8:

```
sage: pol26 = hilbert_class_polynomial(-4*26)
sage: pol = NumberField(pol26,'a').optimized_representation()[0].polynomial()
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(pol)
sage: j = pol26.roots(K)[0][0]
sage: E = EllipticCurve(j=j)
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(x^2+26)
sage: EL = E.change_ring(L)
sage: EL.isogenies_prime_degree(2)
<boom>
AttributeError: 'MPolynomial_polydict' object has no attribute 'gcd'
```

The problem is that the isogeny construction code uses 2-variable polynomial rings where univariate polynomials would suffice.  This can be fixed by using pol.univariate_polynomial() instead of pol in a few places: possibly not the best solution, but it does work.  After the changes to be posted:

```

```

Note, however, that `EL.isogenies_prime_degree(3)`, while it works correctly and finds two 3-isogenies, does give some warnings:

```
sage: iso = EL.isogenies_prime_degree(3); len(iso)

See also #11327 where a more thorough solution was proposed, but not finished, in 2011.  The patch (branch) posted there on 2014-08-09  solves both the issue reported there (constructing duals of 2-isogenies over function fields) and this one.

This ticket is therefore redundant and can be closed as a duplicate while #11327 is ready for review.
