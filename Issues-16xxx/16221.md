Apparently Maxima has this.

```
struve_h (v,z)                 Struve H function
struve_l (v,z)                 Struve L function
```

sage: struve_L(i.n(),100)

  doesn't seem to agree with [W|A](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=struve+L+%28i%2C100%29), though I don't know whether it should even be implemented.
* [W functions](http://functions.wolfram.com/Bessel-TypeFunctions/StruveH/introductions/Struves/05/) claims something that isn't in A&S but that certainly works with mpmath:
