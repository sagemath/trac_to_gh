Keywords: finite_state_machine

In #16141, a class to collect common transducers was introduced. Here, we enhance this class by a new transducers which is mainly meant to be used as readily available component in cartesian products and/or compositions. 

We introduce transducers.weight which realizes the Hamming weight (that is the number of non-zero elements) of the input.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16265
