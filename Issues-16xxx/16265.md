In #16141, a class to collect common transducers was introduced. Here, we enhance this class by a new transducers which is mainly meant to be used as readily available component in cartesian products and/or compositions. 

We introduce transducers.weight which realizes the Hamming weight (that is the number of non-zero elements) of the input.
