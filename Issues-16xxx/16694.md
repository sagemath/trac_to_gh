Sage's Rscript accepts neither files nor arguments.

Consequence : some packages, which need Rscript for installation (because they try to download some library source tarballs) can no longer be installed in R. This include notoriously nloptr, on which lme4 (a mixed-model package ofextremely frequent use) and other often-used packages depend.

Consequence of this consequence : Sage no longer offers a *replacement* for system's R. Ouch !

Apparently, this is not constant.

The problem I reported was shown on a machine using a Sage tarball precompiled on a fast machine with SAGE_FAT_BINARY="yes".

On another machine, compiled without any other flag other than MAJE="make -j8", Rscript works as advertised.

I have other problems with Sage's R (notably, rstan doesn't install), but this another problem (in general Sage builds are brittle...).

Downgrading the priority of the defect to "minor"

Pursuing an apparent bug with an (seemingly unrelated) R package, I came to the conclusion that the proble might be related to R initial configuration.

Since this has been extensively modified in order to accomodate Cygwin's whims, I'd like to suggest that authors of #14706 have a look at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stan-users/Qbkuu51QZvU](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stan-users/Qbkuu51QZvU) and make suggestions about the possible solutions.

Further experiences let me think that this bug might be an artefact of iterative sage building (typical git use) : I'm still unable to reproduce it after "make distclean ; make".

However, I won't close this ticket now.

Probably based on charpent's comments and the time elapsed, yes.
