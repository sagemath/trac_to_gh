Hello

1) I corrected typos in the doc, added a check, added a test, modify few sentences at u/vdelecroix/16662

2) I do not understand why he following is not valid

```
sage: k=10; n=2; m=79; a=b=c=1
sage: for kk,nn in ((k,m),(k,m+1),(k,m+2),(k,a),(k,b),(k,c)):
....:     assert designs.orthogonal_array(k,n,existence=True)
sage: OA=thwart_lemma_3_5(10,2,79,1,1,1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    913         if existence:
    914             return Unknown
--> 915         raise NotImplementedError("I don't know how to build an OA({},{})!".format(k,n))
    916 
    917     if check:

NotImplementedError: I don't know how to build an OA(10,69)!
```
Are a,b,c allowed to be 1? In the examples of the article a,b,c are never 1 (but d might be).

3) I found two examples which yield to error I do not understand from the specifications. The first one is related to the point 2) I guess

```
sage: OA=thwart_lemma_3_5(10,2,89,1,1,1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    456     for B in master_design:
    457         # The missing entries belong to the last n_trunc columns
--> 458         assert all(x is not None for x in B[:k])
    459         n_in_truncated = n_trunc-B.count(None)
    460 

AssertionError: 
```

For the other one, the existence of an OA(9,21) should not be necessary for the construction

```
sage: OA = thwart_lemma_3_5(9,9,22,8,8,8,complement=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
    913         if existence:
    914             return Unknown
--> 915         raise NotImplementedError("I don't know how to build an OA({},{})!".format(k,n))
    916 
    917     if check:

NotImplementedError: I don't know how to build an OA(9,21)!
```

4) I found several new values for which the thwart construction works. But I first would like to understand first why 3) fail.

Vincent

The input is valid but in order to build the new designs you need some sub-designs, and among the subdesigns there is a `OA(10,69)` that Sage does not know how to build.

The first one is related to the point 2) I guess\n\n\nNo, it is just that there exists no `OA(13,2)`. The code has to build an `OA(k+3,n)` (or `OA(k+4,n)` when `d` is defined) and it does not exist if k is too large. I missed that one, probably because that's the kind of thing that I filter in the `find_` function usually.\n\n> For the other one, the existence of an OA(9,21) should not be necessary for the construction\n\n\nThe exception I added for the previous one is also triggered here.\n\n> 4) I found several new values for which the thwart construction works.

How, not "valid" ? The input is valid but in order to build the new designs you need some sub-designs, and among the subdesigns there is a `OA(10,69)` that Sage does not know how to build. Soo well, the construction can't be applied because you need one of the required designs... What's wrong with that ? This is what the `find_` functions usually checks !

> Are a,b,c allowed to be 1? In the examples of the article a,b,c are never 1 (but d might be).


I don't think that there is anything wrong with =1 values.

> 3) I found two examples which yield to error I do not understand from the specifications. The first one is related to the point 2) I guess


No, it is just that there exists no `OA(13,2)`. The code has to build an `OA(k+3,n)` (or `OA(k+4,n)` when `d` is defined) and it does not exist if k is too large. I missed that one, probably because that's the kind of thing that I filter in the `find_` function usually.

> For the other one, the existence of an OA(9,21) should not be necessary for the construction


The exception I added for the previous one is also triggered here.

> 4) I found several new values for which the thwart construction works. But I first would like to understand first why 3) fail.

Could you add some comments ? So many loops and tests, even an internal caching system and no comments is a bit tough.

Also, I don't think you should implement caching systems like that in a `find_` function. If we need such caching (and we do) it should be implemented where it belongs, with a dedicated function.

I had in mind something like that:

```
designs.orthogonal_arrays.build(k,n)
designs.orthogonal_arrays.build_information(k,n)
designs.orthogonal_arrays.is_available(k,n)
designs.orthogonal_arrays.exists(k,n)
designs.orthogonal_arrays.max_k(n)
designs.orthogonal_arrays.all_n(k, min=None, max=None)
```

Though I like this interface, it means quite some amount of copy/paste in the code. For TD and MOLS. Maybe there is a trick.

Hello,

It is not only caching. With a more naive approach you would have

```
for a in xrange(n):
    if not orthogonal_arrays(k,a,existence=True):
        continue
    for b in xrange(a+1):
        if not orthogonal_arrays(k,b,existence=True):
            continue
        for c in xrange(b+1):
            if not orthogonal_arrays(k,c,existence=True):
                continue
```

About your caching system, what would be the difference between `is_available` and `exists`? And instead of `all_n` I would prefer `nrange` or something more pythonic.

I will write some doc but I won't change the code.

Yo !

> It is not only caching. With a more naive approach you would have


What you do there is the work of the "all_n" function I wound like to write. I would like to replace the 

```
for n in range(N-2):
    if is_prime(n)
```

with 

```
for n in prime_powers(N-2):
   ...
```

But it is not possible because you use n to build the cache.

> About your caching system, what would be the difference between `is_available` and `exists`? And instead of `all_n` I would prefer `nrange` or something more pythonic.


`is_available` would not trigger non-existence tests. But perhaps that is less useful since your rewrote the `is_sum_of_squares` thing.

Guess how many times they appear when you type `designs.orthogonal_array(None,1000,existence=1)`: never.

Which means that for 1000 at least computing all `OA(k,n,existence=True)` for n<N is all for naught (but takes 10s).

Hello,

Moving the `good` part would change nothing to the timings. You already have the following for the `m` loop which is the cost of everything

```
            if not (orthogonal_array(k,m+0,existence=True) and
                    orthogonal_array(k,m+1,existence=True) and
                    orthogonal_array(k,m+2,existence=True)):
                continue
```
If you feel like this function is too costly, we can remove it from the `find_recursive_constructions` and just store the interesting values:

```
if (k,n) not in  ((10,1046), (10,1048), (10,1059), (11,1524),
                  (11,2164), (12,3362), (12,3992),  (12,3994)):
    return False
```

About your question, you were right and we can even go up to `n=N-1`.

Tell me what you think about the first question and I will add a commit.

Helloooooooo Vincent !

Okay... So let's do that:

1) You saved some time since the first version, and although it is still slower than needed it's not that awful that we should keep this construction out of those that are automatically tested

2) Those triple loops are really awful things, so we will have to do something about it

3) I am thinking of a data structure that would be useful to us, and whose purpose is to store things like "all n such that there exists a OA(k,n)" or even "all m such that there exists a OA(k,m), OA(k,m+1), OA(k,m+2)".

What it stores: a set of integers defined by a boolean function
What it is meant to answer: give the list of integers between x and y such that the boolean function is satisfied.

Of course we want to minimize the number of boolean function queries. Even though it takes spaces, I am thinking of something like that:

An array which associates to (any) integer n:

a) if f(n) is computed: the smallest integer n'>=n such that f(n') is True or has not been computed yet.

b) if f(n) is not computed yet: None

This way, if you want to get all solutions to `f(n) is True` between x and y, here is what you do:

```
current=x
while current<=y:
    if array[current] is None:
        array[current] = f(current)
    elif array[current] == current:
        yield current
        current+=1
    else:
        new_current = array[current]
        # if array[a]==b and array[b]==c then let's define array[a]=c
        if array[new_current] is not None: 
            array[current] = array[new_current]
        current = new_current
```

This may be cool if we ever implement the `all_n` or `range_n` function.

And we could use it in conjunction with a real function to solve the partition problem, i.e. "try to find integers from a set S whose sum is equal or lequal to C".

Anyway.

1) I merged all your commits into one, as some were undoing the previous ones

2) I added a small commit on top of it. In particular some additional constraint on k that removes fake '+' in the n<100 area `:-D`

Your code is good otherwise.

Hello,

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A30):

And:
- what is the next value (like next_prime)
- what is the previous value (like previous_prime)

The problem with your approach is that you store a lot of data. It is perhaps not as bad as what I imagine.

Questions:

1) why do you stop `n` at `N-3` in the first loop? I think that `n=N-1, m=1, a=1, b=0, c=0` is a valid input:

```
sage: OA = thwart_lemma_3_5(3,13,1,1,0,0)
sage: is_orthogonal_array(OA,3,14,2)
True
```
So the bound should be `N-1`. Perhaps the particular case of `m=1` is taken care by another construction, in that case, this must be documented (and the upper bound for n updated accordingly).

2) the check `d <= n` is not necessary because of the lower bound on `c`.

I edit my commit at `u/vdelecroix/16662` to simplify the code with respect to 2). As soon as 1) is solve, I would be happy to set this to positive review.

That's easy to do. It would be the result of all_n(min=current_value,max=None).next()

This would be harder, but I'm not sure it is needed either `O_o`

Yo !

Oh, I see. I think that this N-2 is correct after all, however. If n=N-2, then it means that there are at most two points in the last 4 columns, i.e. that at most two columns are used. And because all pairs of points are equivalent, this is already handled by the wilson construction with two truncated columns.

I had written some code which I hoped would improve the performances of this function, but well... It produced no difference whatsoever. And I don't know why yet, so let's get this in.

Perhaps the cached "all_n" function will change something `:-/`
