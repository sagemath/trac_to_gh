What is supposed to be done for reviewing?

Building: Just doing `make distclean`, `export SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and `make`? Or is this an optional package, and one needs to just do `sage -i gdb` in an existing Sage install built with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`?

Testing: What would one usually do to test that gdb works? Sure, I can do `sage -gdb` and then run a program that crashes...

The most interesting part is of course that you can use cygdb with a debug build. The system gdb will be built with a non-debug Python and hence have mismatching CPython structures. 

To build you need to run `sage -i gdb`. It is not built by default. You can build with or without `SAGE_DEBUG`, and you can only use cygdb if the Python build matches.

I don't understand that comment. Does "system gdb" mean that we are using the system wide gdb here? 

> To build you need to run `sage -i gdb`. It is not built by default. You can build with or without `SAGE_DEBUG`, and you can only use cygdb if the Python build matches.

Will the Python build match if I take a sage install created with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`, and later do `sage -i gdb`?

No, what I'm trying to say is that the distributor had built gdb a long time ago without debug Python.

If and only if you don't change the setting of the `SAGE_DEBUG` environment variable in the meantime.

OK, I will do "make" and "sage -i gdb" without break, and without changing `SAGE_DEBUG`.

What happens if I change later some Cython file and compile this without `SAGE_DEBUG`. Would gdb work on that file, since it only matters that Python itself was build with `SAGE_DEBUG`? Or would gdb simply not work on that single non-debug compiled Cython file?
