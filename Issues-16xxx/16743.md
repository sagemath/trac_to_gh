If E is an elliptic curve over QQ then E.isogeny_class() is an object of type (class) IsogenyClass_EC which which one can work in a nice way.  This should be extended to number fields.  Two reasons why this is notn-trivial (and hence was not done at the same time as over QQ):  (1) bounding the possible primes degrees of isogenies;  (2) handling curves with CM.  For (1),  the module `gal_reps_number_field` does what is required.  For (2) new code has been written.

I don't think this should be the default `cmp()` for ideals (it's more expensive to compute), but it should be function defined in `rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py`. And why do you need

```
cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```
as opposed to

```
cmp(I.pari_hnf(), J.pari_hnf())
```
That's not clear to me...

Finally, a Python tip: you can shorten

```
t = int(I.norm() - J.norm())
if t:
    return cmp(t,0)

return cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```
to

```
return cmp(I.norm(), J.norm()) or cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```

OK, so here is an example:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: I = K.ideal(4+i)
sage: J = K.ideal(4-i)
sage: HI = I.pari_hnf()
sage: HJ = J.pari_hnf()
sage: HIS = HI.sage()
sage: HJS = HJ.sage()
sage: cmp(HI,HJ)
1
sage: cmp(HIS,HJS)
-1
```
so they diagree.  We have

```
sage: HI, HJ
([17, 4; 0, 1], [17, 13; 0, 1])
sage: HIS, HJS
(
[17  4]  [17 13]
[ 0  1], [ 0  1]
)
```
and I think that I should come before J but using the pari_hnf as is gives the reverse.

Background: I am making databases of things like elliptic curves over number fields, and am having to be very explicit indeed about how various objects are ordered.  This is a special case: two conjugate primes above a rational prime p which plsits in a quadratic field.  I need to order these, and want to do so using the HNFs which only differ in one entry.  Using pari_hnf is not consistent!  (Try the ideals (2+i) and (2-i) and the pari_hnf's compare "correctly".)

I'll have to look at those two other tickets, certainly.  Yet another quagmire!

Thanks a lot for your help and suggestions.  I did not need that ideal comparison for this ticket anyway, so I have left alone the ideal comparison function except to tidy the code as you suggested.  the two elliptic curve comparison functions have gone, replaced by little key comparison functions in the code where they are used -- much better and shorter and faster!

I am doing some final testing and then will upload a new branch in which you will find no utility functions in the wrong place.

In the other tickets where you are dealing with comparing pari objects, good luck:  if you have not already discovered this, you will find that hunderds of number field factorizations have their orders changed....

Thanks a lot for tidying various things up ( at least some of which were not introduced by me, I think!).

We do need someone with a good knowledge of isogenies to check this.  In writing the code I had to work out quite a lot of mathematics for which I do not know a good source (in the CM and potential CM cases).  I am actually using the code a lot all the time now, on many thousands of curves, which is a good test, but the field degrees are small.

I have merged your changes into my branch so if I make any further changes the branch name will go back to what it was (not that it really matters).  I did this using

```
git remote update
git merge trac/u/jdemeyer/ticket/16743
make
```
(in my own local branch), for the record.

No no, it is because those 2 tests depend on an earlier `# long time` test. The following doesn't work:

```
sage: x = answer_to_the_ultimate_question()  # long time (7.5 million years)
sage: x
42
```
If you run this without `--long` the first line will be skipped and the second line will therefore fail.

I spotted that one of the commits of #16806 does not seem to be included in this :

https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/8c9301671b354f7ba6c24d48f28d0e2b0698f39f

Not sure this is important, but it seems the right thing to include it if it is depending on that ticket.

pong!

I thought I would improve the documentation a little bit by including the isogeny class file into it. Other than that I can't see any reason to object against this ticket.

I am running the tests now.
