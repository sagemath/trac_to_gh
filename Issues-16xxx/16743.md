If E is an elliptic curve over QQ then E.isogeny_class() is an object of type (class) IsogenyClass_EC which which one can work in a nice way.  This should be extended to number fields.  Two reasons why this is notn-trivial (and hence was not done at the same time as over QQ):  (1) bounding the possible primes degrees of isogenies;  (2) handling curves with CM.  For (1),  the module `gal_reps_number_field` does what is required.  For (2) new code has been written.

TODO (but not on this ticket):  unify the two GaloisRepresentation classes!  Perhaps there should be a base class which is rather abstract but defines the interface, with child classes for Galois Reps attached to (1) elliptic curves over number fields, (1') same over QQ, (2) modular forms, etc etc.

I don't think this should be the default `cmp()` for ideals (it's more expensive to compute), but it should be function defined in `rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py`. And why do you need

```
cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```
as opposed to

```
cmp(I.pari_hnf(), J.pari_hnf())
```
That's not clear to me...

Finally, a Python tip: you can shorten

```
t = int(I.norm() - J.norm())
if t:
    return cmp(t,0)

return cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```
to

```
return cmp(I.norm(), J.norm()) or cmp(I.pari_hnf().sage(), J.pari_hnf().sage())
```

OK, so here is an example:

```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: I = K.ideal(4+i)
sage: J = K.ideal(4-i)
sage: HI = I.pari_hnf()
sage: HJ = J.pari_hnf()
sage: HIS = HI.sage()
sage: HJS = HJ.sage()
sage: cmp(HI,HJ)
1
sage: cmp(HIS,HJS)
-1
```
so they diagree.  We have

```
sage: HI, HJ
([17, 4; 0, 1], [17, 13; 0, 1])
sage: HIS, HJS
(
[17  4]  [17 13]
[ 0  1], [ 0  1]
)
```
and I think that I should come before J but using the pari_hnf as is gives the reverse.

Background: I am making databases of things like elliptic curves over number fields, and am having to be very explicit indeed about how various objects are ordered.

> I think that those will solve your problem, since matrices would be compared entry-wise, starting with the first column (top-left entry first, then the one below that).

Right, so I have some work to do, and this ticket will acqure another dependency or two -- I hope those two tickets are not going to get held up!

Thanks a lot for your help and suggestions.  I did not need that ideal comparison for this ticket anyway, so I have left alone the ideal comparison function except to tidy the code as you suggested.  the two elliptic curve comparison functions have gone, replaced by little key comparison functions in the code where they are used -- much better and shorter and faster!

I am doing some final testing and then will upload a new branch in which you will find no utility functions in the wrong place.

In the other tickets where you are dealing with comparing pari objects, good luck:  if you have not already discovered this, you will find that hunderds of number field factorizations have their orders changed....

Thanks a lot for tidying various things up ( at least some of which were not introduced by me, I think!).

We do need someone with a good knowledge of isogenies to check this.  In writing the code I had to work out quite a lot of mathematics for which I do not know a good source (in the CM and potential CM cases).  I am actually using the code a lot all the time now, on many thousands of curves, which is a good test, but the field degrees are small.

I have merged your changes into my branch so if I make any further changes the branch name will go back to what it was (not that it really matters).  I did this using

```
git remote update
git merge trac/u/jdemeyer/ticket/16743
make
```
(in my own local branch), for the record.

No no, it is because those 2 tests depend on an earlier `# long time` test. The following doesn't work:

```
sage: x = answer_to_the_ultimate_question()  # long time (7.5 million years)
sage: x
42
```
If you run this without `--long` the first line will be skipped and the second line will therefore fail.

http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=8c9301671b354f7ba6c24d48f28d0e2b0698f39f

Not sure this is important, but it seems the right thing to include it if it is depending on that ticket.

While skimming through the rest of the patch, I just noticed several `# not tested` for the graphs. Any reason?

Replying to [wuthrich](#comment%3A49):
> A quick look at the doc output shows quite a few problems in isogeny_class of elliptic curves over number fields.


Apologies.  I will sort that out, no need for you to.

Please do! Graphics objects are doctested by plotting them to a temporary file. It's good to have those tests, since they check that plotting works (to some extent, it's not checked how the picture looks like).

Note that this plotting machinery might take a while, so it would be prudent to add `# long time` to those plotting tests.

I thought I would improve the documentation a little bit by including the isogeny class file into it. Other than that I can't see any reason to object against this ticket.

I am running the tests now.

As to the mathematics in here. Well, there is a lot and not all is trivial. I have read most of the new code, but I won't be able to verify everything. So my review is to confirm that John does very good work and that I have no doubts that it is as good as it can be.
