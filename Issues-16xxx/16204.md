<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi,

1. Please remove trailing whitespaces.

2. Is it pep8 to have paranthesis after opening paranthesis and before closing ones? (like `( a )`)

3. In

```
Return the number of left nodes number is ``direction``
```
the `is` should be `if`.

4. Using recursive function is a bad idea. Python is not designed to support smartly recursive function calls. You would better use depth first search.

<a id='comment:17'></a>You have not answered my last comment, where I suggest to add just one function instead of three in the `binary_tree` file.

The command `get_node` is already available as:

```
sage: sage: T = OrderedTree([[[], [[], [[]]]], [], [[[], []]], [], []])
sage: T[()]
     ______o_______
    /    /   /  / /

<a id='comment:21'></a>`bt.left_node_number` and `bt.right_node_number` are already easily available as

```
bt[0].node_number()
```
and

```
bt[1].node_number()
```
so please remove the 3 not-so-useful new functions in `binary_trees.py` from your branch.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Hi,

No, it is not the same function.

`bt.right_node_number` gives the number of right vertices inside the tree.
It is not the number of vertices inside the right sub-tree.
