We are building a collaborative index of worksheets or similar Sage-related documents (demos, lectures, exercises, books) in the web that users could search by keywords, language, programming skill, school level, license, ... (please add your wishes).

Indexed documents would preferably be in a re-usable format such as `.rst` `.tex` `.ipynb` `.sage` `.py` files. Especially, their contents would be parsed and indexed as well. Dead links will be reported (typically some links of http://wiki.sagemath.org/Teaching_with_SAGE are dead, and perhaps lost forever).

While http://sagenb.org/ public worksheets are currently disabled due to spam, the aim of this ticket is not to implement another central worksheet repository, only pointers. Especially, it is likely that sage-worksheets will change for ipthon-notebook format in the mid-term, so no hurry.

An alpha version is available at http://sageindex.lipn.univ-paris13.fr/

Any comment is welcome.

etc., and what could be improved.
