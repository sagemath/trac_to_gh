Installing the ChomP package causes `ChainComplex` to give different (and basically wrong) answers.  Here are two examples from the doctests:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex([matrix(ZZ, 1, 1, [2]), matrix(ZZ, 1, 1), matrix(1, 1, [3])])
sage: C.torsion_list(5)
[(2, []), (3, [])]   # Should be [(2, [1]), (3, [3])]
sage: S = simplicial_complexes.SumComplex(17, [0, 1, 4])
sage: S.homology(1)
0    # Should be C140183
```
May be related to #12607 where installing ChomP causes certain 0 dimensional homology groups not to be reported.

And the second looks indeed like an overflow error in a product inside CHomP. This works

```
sage: S = simplicial_complexes.SumComplex(17, [0, 1, 4])
sage: S.homology(algorithm='chomp',verbose=True,base_ring=GF(103))
```
How should we catch the errors of CHomP ?
