In #16020, `graphs.setup_latex_preamble` has been modified to include tikz
into the mathjax avoid list so that graphs can be rendered more easily in
the sage notebook.
    
This ticket does the same for `finite_state_machine.setup_latex_preamble`.

Moreover, `finite_state_machine.setup_latex_preamble` is now loaded automatically (as it is the case in the graphs module).

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

In #16020, we don't need to call:

```
sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.setup_latex_preamble()
```
to see some multi-graphs.
It could be convenient to directly load these lines:

```
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available('tikz')
latex.add_to_mathjax_avoid_list("tikz")
latex.add_to_preamble('\\usetikzlibrary{automata}')
```
when we load the file.

It seems to me, that is not disturbing to load these lines... but it is disturbing to have to call this method to draw some automata.

Cheers,

Jean-Baptiste Priez

Thanks for pointing this out, I was not aware of the fact that the graphs module calls `setup_latex_preamble` automatically. Therefore, I submitted a patch for adapting the documentation of the graphs module (#16620).

So, we now call `setup_latex_preamble` automatically (not when first loading the file as suggested, but when `_latex_` is called as the graphs module does). To reduce overhead,
`setup_latex_preamble` is now a cached function (as in the graphs module). Finally, the documentation has been adapted to reflect the change.
