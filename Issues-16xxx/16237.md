The method IncidenceStructureFromMatrix has a serious bug, and it leads to serious errors in computations. We should fix it ASAP. For example, one may test with HadamardDesign (which uses the buggy implementation of IncidenceStructureFromMatrix). Consider the following output:

```
sage: D = designs.HadamardDesign(11); N = D.incidence_matrix()
sage: J = matrix(ZZ, 11, 11, [1]*11*11); N*J
[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]
[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]
[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]
[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]
[6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6]
[5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
[4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
```

The bug is the indexing used in the if-testing in the method.

I have a fix but my GIT foo is not sufficient to upload it! :-( There is only one line of change to make: the if testing condition should be 

```
if M[j, i] != 0

as opposed to the `if M[i, j] != 0`. :-) Similarly, I also have code for the HadamardThreeDesign too. :-)

So, the new bug is HadamardDesign method assumes that hadamard_matrix returns a Hadamard matrix whose first row and first column is the all-1 vector while hadamard_matrix method does not. This is why the example given in the method works but the example I describe does not:

```
 
So, to get the ball rolling, should there be a new method called normalised_hadamard_matrix or should we let the method hadamard_matrix take an optional argument like normalised=True or sth like that? 

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Hello !

Several remarks:

1) I do not think you should change the definition of the Paley matrices... I believe they are well-defined, and if you want a normalized version of them you should not change their definition but rather normalize them when you need them. At the very least, you could have an optional argument "normalize" set to False by default in these functions.

2) You seem to use twice the code to normalize a matrix. I guess the best would be to write a function that does that, as it can be useful later, and also useful to the users.

3) There may be a smart way to test if a element of a field is a quadratic residue, but if you need to enumerate all of them anyway you could begin by computing the square of all elements of the field, then decide if each element is a square by testing if it belongs to that list ?...

Hello Kannappan !!!

Okayokayokayokay, so you implement more or less Horadam's construction with a couple of changes of signs. Okay. It would be nice to clean this file a bit in the future, because right now there is a "return 0" in functions who claim to return entries of Hadamard matrices `:-P`

Anyway. I agree with what your branch does, and I added a reviewer's commit in public/16237 to fix a couple of typoes.

1) The first line of the documentation of a function should be a one-line description of what it does

2) Some people complain where a line ends with spaces ("trailing whitespaces")

3) Some people complain (the same) when the lines are longer than 80 characters.

4) Some people fight over american/english spelling (but as I never remember which ones, I did nothing about that `:-P`

Sooooooooo well.

If you agree with my changes, you can either :

1) Add my commit to your branch

2) Change the branch to public/16237 (remember that you are the only one with writing access to u/knsam/* branches and that everybody can write to public/* branches

About the doc : it seems to be included already http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/matrices/hadamard_matrix.html

HMmmmmmm... Okay, nothing else to say. Good work !

Nathann

P.S. : The custom is the following : usually, the reviewer sets the ticket to `positive_review`, but in this case I added a commit with small modifications. So if you agree with what it does, you can set the ticket to `positive_review` yourself, as you reviewed my changes and I reviewed yours. And if you do not like something in my commits, the custom is to discuss it and fight to the death.
