Happens sometimes. IPython still doesn't know how to do atomic changes to the history, I guess:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/misc/displayhook.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/misc/displayhook.py", line 23, in sage.misc.displayhook
Failed example:
    shell = get_test_shell()
Expected nothing
Got:
    ERROR! History file wasn't a valid SQLite database. It was moved to /home/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/dot_sage/ipython-1.2.1/profile_default/history-corrupt.sqlite and a new file created.
    ERROR! History file wasn't a valid SQLite database. It was moved to /home/buildslave-sage/slave/sage_git/dot_sage/ipython-1.2.1/profile_default/history-corrupt.sqlite and a new file created.
