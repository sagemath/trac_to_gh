In the long run, the actual folder name should probably be part of Sage's "package metadata".

If there is a single top-level directory then we don't need to store the name (and manually maintain) it elsewhere. There should be some checking, of course. And if you don't have a single top-level directory then I'd consider that to be an upstream bug.

Yep, but that's NYI.

> (and manually maintain) it elsewhere.

Well, we "manually" maintain the "checksums" for each specific upstream tarball anyway (in a **central** repo, tied to specific Sage versions, which is IMHO a bad thing to do anyway). 

> There should be some checking, of course.

Sure.

Well, the `find` version above is portable, although I'd just use it to get the folder name.  (Or some flavour of <code>(cd * && basename \`pwd\`)</code>.)

> The whole contraption should be rewritten in Python with some proper doctesting.

In Lisp, please.




Anyway, I'd really explicitly check whether `src/` afterwards exists (and is a directory); we already have

```sh
    echo "Finished extraction"

    cd "$PKG_NAME"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "Error: after extracting, the directory $PKG_NAME does not exist"
        exit 1
    fi
```
right below for legacy spkgs.




Just out of curiosity:  Which bash version(s) did the original change work with?

I tried older (3.2.*) as well as newer (4.3.11*) bashs; with none of them it worked.

Sage is a Python project. And Python is actually pretty good for sysadmin-type scripts. Unlike lisp. And unlike Bash it can be tested in a sane way.

We don't need a double check, either building the package will break if the rename fails or the rename is not necessary (and, really, wtf do we rename the tarball directory to start with, afaik nobody else does that).
