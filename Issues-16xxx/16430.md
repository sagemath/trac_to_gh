When n is a prime power we know from the start the maximum value of k. With a couple of lines, we avoid calling `is_prime_power` n+1 times for nothing.

Nathann

A dishonest timing:

```
sage: %timeit designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**16,t=2,existence=True) # before
1 loops, best of 3: 1.16 s per loop
sage: %timeit designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**16,t=2,existence=True) # after
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 Âµs per loop
```

This ticket also fixes a couple of bugs, i.e. `designs.orthogonal_array(None,n,t=30,existence=True)` and `designs.orthogonal_array(None,0,existence=True)`.

Hi Nathann,

If the cache in #16460 is used, then this would not be needed anymore. As if `is_prime_power` is called then we would set the cache directly to `n+1` whatever was the value of `k` from the call.

Do you still want to keep it?

Vincent

Why do you allow `t=3` when `existence` is set to `True`?

Well, we could even return 2. Any two columns would do. Anyway, let's return 0 as we have no code to return the actual OA for the moment.

Okayyyyyyyyy... I fixed several things, as this ticket seems to be a "small bugfixes" dictionary `:-P`

1) More explicit error messages in _check_pbd. This function will be rewritten in Cython later anyway, but this way we will not forget the error messages.

2) We can always build an `OA(1341,0)`, i.e. the empty list

3) There is always an `orthogonal_array(t,n,t=t)`. It is just the result of `[k]^k`

4) I fixed the "undefined for `t<k` bug you mentionned, but I wondered if there was a reason to have such an exception. I mean, if you want a property to hold "for any t columns", it holds in particular when you have <t columns doesn't it ? So I would vote for removing this exception. If you agree with it I will add a commit, while in the updated branch the problem is avoided without touching this line

5) I return an `OA(t,n,t)` directly to avoid calling `is_orthogonal_array`. It is safe because the orthogonal array I return IS an orthogonal array, and I do it because `is_orthogonal_array` does not support t>2 yet. But then, those orthogonal arrays are the only ones we can return with t>2.

I find weird that `IntegerRange` only writes two points in `{0, .., 5}`, but okay... Is there any reason for that ? `:-P`
