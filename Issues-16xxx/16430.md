When n is a prime power we know from the start the maximum value of k. With a couple of lines, we avoid calling `is_prime_power` n+1 times for nothing.

Nathann

A dishonest timing:

```
sage: %timeit designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**16,t=2,existence=True) # before
1 loops, best of 3: 1.16 s per loop
sage: %timeit designs.orthogonal_array(None,2**16,t=2,existence=True) # after
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.9 Âµs per loop
```

This ticket also fixes a couple of bugs, i.e. `designs.orthogonal_array(None,n,t=30,existence=True)` and `designs.orthogonal_array(None,0,existence=True)`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hi Nathann,

If the cache in #16460 is used, then this would not be needed anymore. As if `is_prime_power` is called then we would set the cache directly to `n+1` whatever was the value of `k` from the call.

Do you still want to keep it?

I find weird that `IntegerRange` only writes two points in `{0, .., 5}`, but okay... Is there any reason for that ? `:-P`

```
     .. SEEALSO::
