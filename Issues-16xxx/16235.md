<a id='comment:17'></a>Hi Nathann,

In the first commit, I did the rebase.

In the following ones:
- I changed TD/MOLS to not raise an error when n=1 that you started to do in `orthogonal_array` (and add the appropriate doctests)... consequence: more MOLS are available!!!!!!
- I also changed the `availability` into `existence`
