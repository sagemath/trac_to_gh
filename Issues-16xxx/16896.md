The calling convention of `row_reduced_form` and `weak_popov_form` is bizarre and should be fixed.

1. It takes a parameter `ascend` but this is ignored. It's original purpose was something like sorting the rows, but this is not part of weak Popov form or row reduced, and shouldn't pollute this method.

2. It returns a 3-tuple `(W,U,d)`. Usually, `W` is the only object of interest (the row reduced form), while `U` is a transformation matrix which can sometimes be useful. `d` can be computed directly from `W` and shouldn't be returned at all.

3. When the input is a matrix over a polynomial ring, it returns the output as over the fraction field, though the output always *lie* in the polynomial ring. This is senseless and confusing.

I've added optional parameters `transformation = False` for returning `U`. To enable printing a deprecation warning for at least a year while supporting the old call style, I've added optional parameter `old_call = True`. Set this to `False` to get the future call style and disable deprecation warning. In one year, we'll change the default behaviour but retain `old_call` as an acceptable argument, but print a deprecation warning if one sets it. In two years, we can finally remove `old_call` and have the clean calling convention. <sigh>...

    "body": "<a id='comment:7'></a>\nHello,\n\nA few comments on this ticket:\n\n1) Merge with latest beta of Sage is not possible as is, as some conflicts arise with the merge. It needs to be fixed.\n\n2) There are some trailing whitespaces in both `matrix2.pyx` and `matrix_misc.py`, it will be good to remove them.\n\n3) The documentation of `row_reduced_form` mentions weak Popov form several times, like:\n\n```\n\n OUTPUT:\n\n        `W` - a matrix over `k(x)` giving a weak the Popov form of self\n```\n\nbut as far as I understand it, `row_reduced_form` does not compute the weak Popov form, for instance:\n\n```\nsage: R.<t> = QQ['t']\nsage: M = matrix([[t,t,t^2],[0,0,t], [0, t, 0]])\nsage: M.row_reduced_form()\n[t t 0]\n[0 0 t]\n[0 t 0]\n``` \ndoes not output a matrix in wPf as leading positions are the same for the first and third third rows of `M`. In that case, change occurences of weak Popov form by row reduced form.\n\n4) It could be nice to add another example in `matrix_misc.py` to illustrate the output in the case where `transformation=True`.\n\n5) You changed the arguments of `row_reduced_form` in this ticket. But in #16742, you will get the original implementation of `row_reduced_form`, which might create a conflict between the two tickets. You need to add a dependency somewhere to be sure that the merge goes smoothly.",

Hello,

A few comments on this ticket:

1) Merge with latest beta of Sage is not possible as is, as some conflicts arise with the merge. It needs to be fixed.

2) There are some trailing whitespaces in both `matrix2.pyx` and `matrix_misc.py`, it will be good to remove them.

3) The documentation of `row_reduced_form` mentions weak Popov form several times, like:

```

 OUTPUT:

        `W` - a matrix over `k(x)` giving a weak the Popov form of self
```

but as far as I understand it, `row_reduced_form` does not compute the weak Popov form, for instance:

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ['t']
sage: M = matrix([[t,t,t^2],[0,0,t], [0, t, 0]])
sage: M.row_reduced_form()
[t t 0]
[0 0 t]
[0 t 0]
``` 
does not output a matrix in wPf as leading positions are the same for the first and third third rows of `M`. In that case, change occurences of weak Popov form by row reduced form.

4) It could be nice to add another example in `matrix_misc.py` to illustrate the output in the case where `transformation=True`.

5) You changed the arguments of `row_reduced_form` in this ticket. But in #16742, you will get the original implementation of `row_reduced_form`, which might create a conflict between the two tickets. You need to add a dependency somewhere to be sure that the merge goes smoothly.

I guess I'm bad news' harbinger again, as I noticed the following:

```
sage: PR.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: M = random_matrix(PR, 5, 5)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
sage: type(M.row_reduced_form(transformation=False, old_call=False)[0, 0])
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_FpT.FpTElement'>
```

So it seems that the actual implementation messes with the type of the elements in the matrix, which is never a good thing...
