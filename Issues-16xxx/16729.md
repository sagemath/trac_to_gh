This patch adds a class of weighted Dynkin diagram (and associated weighted Cartan types). These weights appear above the nodes of the diagram. This notation is used in the theory of nilpotent orbits and in a certain subbranch of differential geometry, see e.g. â€‹http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1307

Depends on #15948
