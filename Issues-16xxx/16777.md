cProfile does not track c-calls.  Google performance tools do so, hand have been wrapped up recently.  This integrates the gperftools into sage.misc.citation, reorganizes code for future development, and fixes one issue with globals. Concerning the latter, Cython was used wrongly, in as far as it's globals() are incorrect in the currenct version. The inspect module is the right way to go, guaranteed to work in future versions as well.
