The Py2 builtin function `reduce()` is available in Py3 as `functools.reduce()`.

The tool 2to3 adds `from functools import reduce`.

From the [|Python 2.7 documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functools.html#module-functools): 

functools.reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])

This is the same function as reduce(). It is made available in this module to allow writing code more forward-compatible with Python 3.
New in version 2.6.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

I didn't realize that `from functools import reduce` is already possible since Python 2.6 (see the changed description).

All test passed `./sage -tp 4 --all --long >logs/sage-tp4-all-long-16078.log`.

But I think it would be better (see also PEP8) to do the imports only once at the top of teach module. For 24 modules this could be generated by `2to3` - the 3 `.pyx` and the 1 doctest case go extra.
