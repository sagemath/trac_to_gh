The discrete Gaussian module relies on `SAGE_ROOT` in `nodule_list.py` but it shouldn't. See comment in #16968. 

In this case the use of SAGE_ROOT to add an include directory was masking the fact that one header was forgotten in depend. While that trick work with plain sage it fails straight away in sage-on-gentoo. If the author had used SAGE_SRC instead the mistake could have gone undiscovered for a while. The usage of both SAGE_ROOT and SAGE_SRC are discouraged in module_list.py.
