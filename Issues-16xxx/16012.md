Hi Andrey,

there's a simple fix for that. Simply replace

`if self.lattice_dim() == 2:`

in `fan.py` by

`if self.lattice_dim() == 2 and self.lattice() is self.lattice().ambient_module() and other.lattice() is other.lattice().ambient_module()`

because the alternative method of trying to find an isomorphism still works - it's just the echelon forms that 'know' about the sublattice and therefore compare unequal. Alternatively, one could modify the `fan_2d_echelon_form()` in `fan_isomorphism.py` such that it removes empty rows.

What do you think?

Okay, actually it might be smarter to do something else, because although what I suggested above fixes the `is_isomorphic` method, the `isomorphism` method still does not work.

I am attaching a branch that changes the output of two auxiliary functions. When computing echelonized forms of 2d fans and when trying to find isomorphisms between fans, the coordinates now used aren't those of the ambient space anymore, but of a basis of the lattice.
I'm not sure whether that's a smart thing to do, since there might be some arbitrariness in the choice of basis, but `FanMorphism` expects a matrix with `nrows` / `ncols` equal to the dimension of the lattice itself, not the dimension of the ambient space.

What do you think? In any case, there are still some doctests missing.
