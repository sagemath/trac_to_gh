Creating multivariate polynomials from dictionaries is slow and grinds to a halt around 100k terms. In particular, it seems to grow worse than `O(N^2)`. Unpickling falls precisely into this trap.

With my C function profiler from #16038 we see that the problem is in `p_Add_q`, which presumably also does some sorting:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 16, 'a')
sage: # p = polynomial with 26492 terms
sage: p_dict = p.dict()
sage: %crun R(p_dict)

It's doing things naively, i.e. it adds terms up instead of building the list manually. Doing the list building ourselves would require reading a bit of Singular code to make sure we're doing it rightâ„¢.

Well, could the right thing to do be anything else but (1) sorting the dictionary items according to the term ordering, or (2) sorting the dictionary items according to the *inverse* term ordering, before feeding them to `p_Add_q`?
