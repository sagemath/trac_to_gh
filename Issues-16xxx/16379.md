This patch will enhance the current functions hasse_invariant and hasse_invariant_OMeara to include computations of Hasse invariant for quadratic forms over number fields.  In addition, this patch fixes an indexing error in the original hasse_invariant_OMeara code, which currently reads

```
for j in range(n-1):
    for k in range(j, n):
```
but should read 

```
for j in range(n):
    for k in range(j, n):
```
to be consistent with OMeara's algorithm.

Looks good to me except for two minor points:
- it is best to keep existing doctests as far as possible; only add new ones, and fix old ones if necessary instead of replacing them;
- your patch introduces trailing whitespace on several lines (use e.g. `git diff --color develop...YOURBRANCH` to see this); this is discouraged, so could you remove it if and when you make another commit?
(The patchbot encountered a doctest failure on 6.3.beta1, but it seems to be unrelated to your patch.)
