```
The method `NumberField_generic.pari_bnf()` does not detect if the PARI `bnf` has already been certified and therefore always calls `bnfcertify()`.  This is due to name-mangling of double-underscore attributes; more precisely, in

```
getattr(self, "__pari_bnf_certified", False)
```
This can be solved by renaming all `__pari_*` attributes to `_pari_*` (`*` = `bnf`, `bnf_certified`, `nf`, `polynomial`).

<div id="comment:3" align="right">Comment 3</div>

I have nothing against that, but for consistency we should then change all number field attributes starting with `__pari`, namely:
- `__pari_bnf`
- `__pari_bnf_certified`
- `__pari_nf`
- `__pari_polynomial`
The same could be done for elements, ideals and unit groups, if that isn't taking it too far.
