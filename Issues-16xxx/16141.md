Inspired by the (Di)graph_generators, provide a class
`TransducerGenerators` where commonly usable transducers
performing simple tasks can be collected. As for graphs,
an abbreviation transducers is injected in the global
namespace by a lazy_import.
    
To start with, there is a Identity transducer and
a `CountSubblockOccurrences` transducer.
