There are frequent timeouts when doctesting on OS X with pexpect interfaces, in particular Singular. For example:

```
$ ./sage -tp src/doc/en/constructions

...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t src/doc/en/constructions/algebraic_geometry.rst  # Timed out
sage -t src/doc/en/constructions/polynomials.rst  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
These became much more frequent by the changes in the Singular/pexpect interface from #15631 on two buildbots:
* OSX 10.9 (Oxford)
* Ubuntu 8.04 (UW)
* This happens mostly during parallel doctesting, and disappers when the system load is low
Other build bots do not seem to be affected, so its a likely pty kernel bug.

* Singular does print its header and prompt (captured with dtrace)
* Python never sees any output from the subprocess, the first select() in `pexpect.read_nonblocking` hangs forever.

One way to reduce the likelihood of the hang is to insert a sleep before first reading from the subproces (in `expect._start`)
