```

A few things here

1) trailing white space at end of function needs to be removed

2) Macaulay is spelled wrong in code comment

3) The function description still describes it as for P1

4) Does macaulay_resulant already coerce to the base ring? so the extra coercsion in that case is not needed. Although we need to be careful since it is saying the output should be in the base_ring of the codomain and macaulay_resultant may coerce to the base ring of the domain.

5) QQbar does not work (but does for macaulay_resultant in general)

Otherwise functionality it working correctly.
