As first reported in #15625 (comment:7) with `lucas_number1`, the same problem is encountered with gap evaluation of Stirling numbers:

```
sage: stirling_number1(1000,2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-22-b29f3b3e2003> in <module>()
----> 1 stirling_number1(Integer(1000),Integer(2))

/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/combinat.pyc in stirling_number1(n, k)
    650     """
    651     return Integer(gap.eval("Stirling1({0},{1})".format(Integer(n),
--> 652                                                         Integer(k))))
    653 
    654 

/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/integer.so in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__init__ (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:7902)()

TypeError: unable to convert x (=<integer 301...000 (2566 digits)>) to an integer
```
The way to go would be to replace `gap.eval` with `libgap.eval` and it's faster, too:

```
sage: timeit('Integer(gap.eval("Stirling1(100,2)"))')
625 loops, best of 3: 419 µs per loop
sage: timeit('libgap.eval("Stirling1(100,2)").sage()')
625 loops, best of 3: 125 µs per loop
sage: timeit('libgap.eval("Stirling1(1000,2)").sage()')
125 loops, best of 3: 6.45 ms per loop
```
Addendum: even faster would be to use `(n-1)!*H(n-1)` for `stirling(n,2)`, dependent on #16671:

```
sage: harmonic_number(99)*factorial(99)==stirling_number1(100,2)
True
sage: timeit('harmonic_number(99)*factorial(99)')
625 loops, best of 3: 56.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('harmonic_number(999)*factorial(999)')
625 loops, best of 3: 119 µs per loop
```
