Projective planes are currently implemented as block designs but are **very** slow to construct (see timings in #16272). Moreover the specifications and the behaviour are contradictory.

In this ticket
- we remove `ProjectivePlaneDesign`
- we create a function `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` that return the corresponding projective plane or raise a `ValueError`
- we create a function `projective_plane` that return **a** projective plane if there is an available construction, or raise a `EmptySetError` if no construction is possible or raise a `NotImplementedError` if no construction is currently available.

We also implement two translation functions `projective_plane_to_OA` and `OA_to_projective_plane` that make the translation between orthogonal arrays (with parameters `k=n+1` and `t=2`) and projective planes.

This is an intermediate step for #16272. See also the follow up #16283 about construction of more projective planes.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Heeeeeeeeereis the review !

- Designs end with "Design", i.e. DesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign. I don't say that it is a good idea, but that we should change it for all of them or not at all. Plus Dima will complain.

- Why not use deprecated_function_alias for designs.ProjectivePlaneDesign ?

- You can do this instead
  {{{
  relabel = {x:i for i,x in enumerate(K)}
  Klist = relabel # Klist represent the set of elements of K
  }}}

- `projective_plane_to_OA`: there is a function in bibd.py called `_relabel_BIBD` that takes a BIBD on n points as input (here it would be a projective plane) and relabels its elements in such a way that [[0,..,k-2,n],[k-1,...,2*k-2,n],...,[n-k-1,n-1]] are sets of the BIBD. So well. It actually does what you are doing : it relabels the BIBD such that when you remove all blocks containing n-1 you get a well-labelled TD.

- `OA_to_projective_plane` I implemented something VERY SIMILAR in #16279 but not equivalent :-)

- `OA_to_projective_plane` : Why do you need to relabel anything ?
  {{{
+    # add the n^2 lines that correspond to transversals
+    for l in OA:
+        blcks.append([i+(n+1)*j for i,j in enumerate(l)])
  }}}
  The OA is already well labelled. The BIBD is exactly the blocks from the OA plus the k groups union the new element, isn't it ? This should just be a deepcopy.

- Isn't the triangle a Projective Plane of order 1 ?

Because of the argument "type"... funny isn't it?

I do not know what is a bibd and I did not have a look at it (except changing the call to ProjectivePlaneDesign). If you feel like removing more code I am happy with that but I will not do it (if you do, wait until the other remarks are implemented).

Nope: in a projective plane there should be a quadrilateral.

Do you think that the "pt" argument is useful ? If it is not, I can rewrite this in 4-5 lines.

I do not think that it is useful, given that from the pair "PP,pt" there is not an "unique" resulting OA. So well, the function just creates a OA from a PP, and we cannot say much more.

A way to make it clearer would be to define the following functions. If you have another idea I really don't mind, I just want to understand the code `^^;`

```
pair_to_int = lambda x,y : relabel[x] + n*relabel[y]

<a id='comment:19'></a>Hi,

The projective plane over a field is the set of equivalence classes of non-zero vectors `(x,y,z)` up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar. You can decompose the projective plane into:
- an affine plane: `(x,y,1)`
- an affine line "at infinity": `(x,1,0)`
- a point "at infinity": `(1,0,0)`
I would prefer the names

```
affine_plane   = lambda x,y : relabel[x] + n*relabel[y]
line_infinity  = lambda x : x + n2
point_infinity = n2 + n 
```
I am making it.

How about a HUGE comment as follows

```
# we decompose the points (x:y:z) of the projective space into an affine
# plane, an affine line and a point. At the same time, we relabel the points
# with the integers from 0 to n^2 + n. It is done as follows:
# the affine plane is the set of points (x:y:1) and gets relabeled

affine_plane   = lambda x,y: relabel[x] + n * relabel[y]
    
# the affine line is the set of points (x:1:0)
# and gets relabeld from n^2 to n^2 + n - 1
line_infinity  = lambda x: n2 + relabel[x]
    
# the point is (1:0:0)
# and gets relabeld n^2 + n
point_infinity = n2 + n
