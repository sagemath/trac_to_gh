Projective planes are currently implemented as block designs but are **very** slow to construct (see timings in #16272). Moreover the specifications and the behaviour are contradictory.

In this ticket
- we remove `ProjectivePlaneDesign`
- we create a function `DesarguesianProjectivePlane` that return the corresponding projective plane or raise a `ValueError`
- we create a function `projective_plane` that return **a** projective plane if there is an available construction, or raise a `EmptySetError` if no construction is possible or raise a `NotImplementedError` if no construction is currently available.

We also implement two translation functions `projective_plane_to_OA` and `OA_to_projective_plane` that make the translation between orthogonal arrays (with parameters `k=n+1` and `t=2`) and projective planes.

This is an intermediate step for #16272. See also the follow up #16283 about construction of more projective planes.

Heeeeeeeeereis the review !

- Designs end with "Design", i.e. DesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign. I don't say that it is a good idea, but that we should change it for all of them or not at all. Plus Dima will complain.

- Why not use deprecated_function_alias for designs.ProjectivePlaneDesign ?

- You can do this instead
  {{{
  relabel = {x:i for i,x in enumerate(K)}
  Klist = relabel # Klist represent the set of elements of K
  }}}

- `projective_plane_to_OA`: there is a function in bibd.py called `_relabel_BIBD` that takes a BIBD on n points as input (here it would be a projective plane) and relabels its elements in such a way that [[0,..,k-2,n],[k-1,...,2*k-2,n],...,[n-k-1,n-1]] are sets of the BIBD. So well. It actually does what you are doing : it relabels the BIBD such that when you remove all blocks containing n-1 you get a well-labelled TD.

- `OA_to_projective_plane` I implemented something VERY SIMILAR in #16279 but not equivalent :-)

- `OA_to_projective_plane` : Why do you need to relabel anything ?
  {{{
+    # add the n^2 lines that correspond to transversals
+    for l in OA:
+        blcks.append([i+(n+1)*j for i,j in enumerate(l)])
  }}}
  The OA is already well labelled. The BIBD is exactly the blocks from the OA plus the k groups union the new element, isn't it ? This should just be a deepcopy.

- Isn't the triangle a Projective Plane of order 1 ?

I do not know what is a bibd and I did not have a look at it (except changing the call to ProjectivePlaneDesign). If you feel like removing more code I am happy with that but I will not do it (if you do, wait until the other remarks are implemented).

Nope: in a projective plane there should be a quadrilateral.

by the way: a BIBD is an edge-decomposition of a Complete graph on n elements with complete graphs of k elements. It is a collection of sets of size k such that any pair of elements in [n] belong to exactly one of these sets of size k. Somehow it is a projective plane with uniform lines, but two lines do not necessarily intersect.

Do you think that the "pt" argument is useful ? If it is not, I can rewrite this in 4-5 lines.

I do not think that it is useful, given that from the pair "PP,pt" there is not an "unique" resulting OA. So well, the function just creates a OA from a PP, and we cannot say much more.

In your construction of the projective plane I do not understand what you mean by the coordinates, especially while reading the code.

A way to make it clearer would be to define the following functions. If you have another idea I really don't mind, I just want to understand the code `^^;`

```
pair_to_int = lambda x,y : relabel[x] + n*relabel[y]
infinity = lambda x : x + n2
```

This way we can read the code without trying to translate the coordinates `^^;`

Hi,

The projective plane over a field is the set of equivalence classes of non-zero vectors `(x,y,z)` up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar. You can decompose the projective plane into:
- an affine plane: `(x,y,1)`
- an affine line "at infinity": `(x,1,0)`
- a point "at infinity": `(1,0,0)`
I would prefer the names

```
affine_plane   = lambda x,y : relabel[x] + n*relabel[y]
line_infinity  = lambda x : x + n2
point_infinity = n2 + n 
```
I am making it.

Three because of the definition I know... quotient out `K^3 \ {0}` by the positive scalar acting by multiplication. Then, you can manage to decompose into plane+line+point.

How about a HUGE comment as follows

```
# we decompose the points (x:y:z) of the projective space into an affine
# plane, an affine line and a point. At the same time, we relabel the points
# with the integers from 0 to n^2 + n. It is done as follows:
# the affine plane is the set of points (x:y:1) and gets relabeled
# from 0 to n^2-1
affine_plane   = lambda x,y: relabel[x] + n * relabel[y]
    
# the affine line is the set of points (x:1:0)
# and gets relabeld from n^2 to n^2 + n - 1
line_infinity  = lambda x: n2 + relabel[x]
    
# the point is (1:0:0)
# and gets relabeld n^2 + n
point_infinity = n2 + n

Defined as equivalence classes okay, but it stays abstract and you still have no coordinates. But then you say "I can either normalize the third coordinate if it is nonzero, otherwise I normalize the second coordinate,and if I can't I normalize the first".

Well... I am used to defined this thing with "three kinds of points" :-P

Anyway, if you can put this inside of the branch then no problem `:-)`
