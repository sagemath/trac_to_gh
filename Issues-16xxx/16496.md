There should be a proper class for Selmer groups of number fields K(S,m), similar to the existing and related S-unit groups and S-class-group classes: it fits into the short exact sequence

  ` 1 --> O<sup>*_{K,S}/(O</sup>*_{K,S})^m --> K(S,m) --> Cl_{K,S}[m] --> 1 . `

Currently K.selmer_group(S,m) just returns a list of generators; it should be a proper finite abelian group.  Angelos Koutsianas already has code which expresses a given element in terms of the generators.
