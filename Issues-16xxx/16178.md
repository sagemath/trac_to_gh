Currently, the maxima install process uses asdf to create a fasl file. This has caused problems in several situations already, most notably in sage-on-gentoo. There I came up with a different approach, which doesn't use asdf but instead patches the maxima build instructions to emit the fasl along with the program. Essentially I duplicate the `c::build-program` invocation and turn that duplicate into `c::build-fasl`. I guess doing so might be beneficial to sage as well. I'll create this ticket here then start working on a branch which includes my approach.

That's the easy part.

> As for SPKG.txt the new way is to slim them down because most of the interesting stuff is in the commit message[‚Ä¶]. Look at eclib and flint for current example.


Looking at them, and at [the Developer's Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#the-spkg-txt-file), it seems as if the best way would be removing the Changelog.

I'm less sure about the information about ‚ÄúHow to make a new version of the Maxima spkg‚Äù. I haven't tried it, don't know whether it's correct any more. If it is, should it be moved to the ‚ÄúSpecial !Update/Build Instructions‚Äù section instead?

The part about `spkg-dist` seems to refer to what `spkg-src` does now. Perhaps that should go into a comment inside that script instead? Although this one sentence in the ‚ÄúSpecial !Update/Build Instructions‚Äù already sums it up: ‚ÄúIt removes a large amount of unused documentation and disables the associated Makefiles, reducing the size of the SPKG greatly.‚Äù

> also a few lines about this wouldn't go amiss.


I'm unsure about what exactly you are referring to here. A few lines about the current `SPKG.txt` conventions, like those in the dev guide? Or a few lines about my modifications, despite the fact that this is against the trend of slimming the files down?

To clarify in my own words: I'm not removing asdf, but I'm removing the use of a separate ASDF invocation to build the maxima library. If you look at the diff for [880002d](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=880002dc3e5348bfa37ad722f3c099c1898b6128), you will see that up to now, there would be several lines of ecl script in the spkg-install script, which do the asdf calling.

The reason for this, as I see it, is that maxima is neither designed to be used as a library, nor to be built with asdf. They directly speak to the [ecl compiler functions](http://sourceforge.net/p/ecls/ecl/ci/master/tree/src/cmp/cmpmain.lsp), and call `c::build-program`.
