Currently, the maxima install process uses asdf to create a fasl file. This has caused problems in several situations already, most notably in sage-on-gentoo. There I came up with a different approach, which doesn't use asdf but instead patches the maxima build instructions to emit the fasl along with the program. Essentially I duplicate the `c::build-program` invocation and turn that duplicate into `c::build-fasl`. I guess doing so might be beneficial to sage as well. I'll create this ticket here then start working on a branch which includes my approach.

That's the easy part.

> As for SPKG.txt the new way is to slim them down because most of the interesting stuff is in the commit message[…]. Look at eclib and flint for current example.


Looking at them, and at [the Developer's Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#the-spkg-txt-file), it seems as if the best way would be removing the Changelog.

I'm less sure about the information about “How to make a new version of the Maxima spkg”. I haven't tried it, don't know whether it's correct any more. If it is, should it be moved to the “Special !Update/Build Instructions” section instead?

The part about `spkg-dist` seems to refer to what `spkg-src` does now. Perhaps that should go into a comment inside that script instead? Although this one sentence in the “Special !Update/Build Instructions” already sums it up: “It removes a large amount of unused documentation and disables the associated Makefiles, reducing the size of the SPKG greatly.”

> also a few lines about this wouldn't go amiss.


I'm unsure about what exactly you are referring to here. A few lines about the current `SPKG.txt` conventions, like those in the dev guide? Or a few lines about my modifications, despite the fact that this is against the trend of slimming the files down?

But we haven't really changed the sources to be distributed with sage so no concern. 

I think in SPKG.txt you can create a section describing the patches and what they do. pari has a README.txt in the patches sub-folder but it also has a quantity of patches. Other than that, yes you can cull the changelog.

asdf is the normal way to build Lisp packages, IMHO. Removing it is akin to removing makefiles and replacing them with hand-written scripts. Is it the way to go? asdf is actively developed and maintained. Perhaps one should ask for help instead?

I only saw this ticket on sage-release, that's why a late reaction.

I've asked Maxima upstream to accept the FASL patch: https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/patches/80/

I don't know the surrounding Lisp ecosystem very well, so please help me with making points etc in case they have reservations about it.
