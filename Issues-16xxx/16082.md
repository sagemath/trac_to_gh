as of sage 7.5.rc2

running all doctests with "from future_builtins import zip" does not give any error

I propose therefore to close this ticket

EDIT: this needs to be checked very carefully.

Yes, I can.

What I mean is the following: one should find a way to run all doctests with the py3 behaviour of zip activated **both in doctests and in code**. I have not been able to do that so far, as it seems that adding an import line to src/sage/all.py is not enough.

Same thing for range in #16081
