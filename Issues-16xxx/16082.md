as of sage 7.5.rc2

running all doctests with "from future_builtins import zip" does not give any error

I propose therefore to close this ticket

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment:11):
> You should really think about putting `from six.moves import zip` in `sage.all`. That will affect everybody using Sage. Doing something like that should be explicitly discussed on sage-devel (and not in a thread called "how to check zip, map, range, print for Python3").

This is a ***f#### test ticket***, with milestone wontfix. It has never been my intention to make this enter sage. Could you please make a more useful contribution ?
