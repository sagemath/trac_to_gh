as of sage 7.5.rc2

Yes, I can.

What I mean is the following: one should find a way to run all doctests with the py3 behaviour of zip activated **both in doctests and in code**. I have not been able to do that so far, as it seems that adding an import line to src/sage/all.py is not enough.

Replying to [@jdemeyer](#comment%3A11):
> You should really think about putting `from six.moves import zip` in `sage.all`. That will affect everybody using Sage. Doing something like that should be explicitly discussed on sage-devel (and not in a thread called "how to check zip, map, range, print for Python3").

This is a ***f#### test ticket***, with milestone wontfix. It has never been my intention to make this enter sage. Could you please make a more useful contribution ?

It seems that the *only* indication that it was a test ticket is the milestone. Nothing in the title nor the description nor in your sage-devel thread was making it clear that this was a test ticket. So that could easily be overlooked.
