as of sage 7.5.rc2

running all doctests with "from future_builtins import zip" does not give any error

I propose therefore to close this ticket

EDIT: this needs to be checked very carefully.

Yes, I can.

Description changed:
``````diff

+++ 
@@ -1,10 +1 @@
-In Py2 `zip()` returns a list, while in Py3 `zip()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.izip()` does in Py2).
-
-The tool 2to3 wraps `zip()` usages with a call to `list()`.
-
-
-An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import zip` and to check where a wrapping with `list()` is required.
-
-There are 54 effected modules. 
-
-This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.
+This ticket is used for doctesting the Python 3 compatibility of `zip()`. It is not a real ticket and should not be merged.

Was it **really** necessary to be so unpolite?

It seems that the *only* indication that it was a test ticket is the milestone. Nothing in the title nor the description nor in your sage-devel thread was making it clear that this was a test ticket. So that could easily be overlooked.
