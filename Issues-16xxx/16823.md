IIRC, I followed [MKO1998], which I thought was based on Hall's original construction, but I can't seem to find that reference. I am not tied to the name, and another name might be better if someone wants to implement the other 2 "natural" Hall set based bases. It's up to you.

Also, we should get rid of this filter:

```diff
-cf = filter(lambda x: x != 0, c)
+cf = [x for x in c if x != 0]
```
Just below that, we could also do:

```diff
-                nonzero_indices = []
-                for i in range(len(c)):
-                    if c[i] != 0:
-                        nonzero_indices.append(i)
+                nonzero_indices = [i for i,val in enumerate(c) if val != 0]
```
I can make these changes if you want.

Yeah, not sure why the Stu1993 reference was removed. Merge gone wrong?

Doc of `graded_dimension` method: replace `n^(k/d)` by `n^{k/d}` (unless our parser somehow handles parentheses here).

I'm a bit surprised that `_rewrite_bracket` is an abstract method on class `FreeLieBasis_abstract` and not on some higher-up class for arbitrary Lie algebras with ordered family bases. But you know better how the class hierarchy should work.

Based on my arguably naive read of the `lie_algebra_generators` method, it constructs the generators in the Lyndon bases, even if `self` is a Hall basis. Is this really what the rest of the code expects? Same for `gens`.

Where did you get the definition of a Hall set from? [MKO...]? I cannot really match it with Reutenauer's (Section 5 in http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/~christo/Publi%C3%A9s/2003/free%20Lie%20algebras.pdf ); for example, your `b._left <= a` seems to contradict Reutenauer's rule, which is more like `a._right >= b`. More importantly, what is the ordering on the free magma that you are using? Even [MKO...] leaves this undecided ("Elements of the same length are ordered internally as we please"). At the very least it seems to be a degree-first ordering, since otherwise it's probably illegal to restrict yourself to `i in range(1, (k+1) // 2)`.

Also, what is the mathematical significance of the `GradedLieBracket` class? Are they something like the free magma? Things like this should probably be a lot more transparent, ideally with a way for the user to specify the ordering on the free magma.

Yep, bad merge.

Done.

It makes no sense anywhere else as this is the only class that has elements stored as trees of Lie brackets.
