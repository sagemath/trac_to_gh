Great! thanks!

When you finish the review, you might better fill the reviewer field with your name (otherwise the release manager has extra job to do). It should be filled with your full name. I did it for you anyway.

Vincent

PS: Actually, I thought that the default answer of .abs() could be an element of QQbar (whenever an embedding in QQbar is defined). That way we would have an exact algebraic number and not an approximation. But in order to do that, there is something to fix with embeddings:

```
sage: K.<cbrt2> = NumberField(x^3 - 2, embedding=1)
sage: QQbar.has_coerce_map_from(K)
False
```
