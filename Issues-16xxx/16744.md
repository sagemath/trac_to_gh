<a id='comment:1'></a>It seems that this doctest is intended to illustrate that specifying "gens=" when cponstructing a curve from its label might be ignored when the curve is in the database.  But there is a danger:  the default database contains curves of conductors up to 10000 but does *not* contain their generators.

I hope the authors of #11474 (not me!) will be able to say whether I have got this diagnosis right.
