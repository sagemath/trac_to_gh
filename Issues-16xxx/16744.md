It seems that this doctest is intended to illustrate that specifying "gens=" when cponstructing a curve from its label might be ignored when the curve is in the database.  But there is a danger:  the default database contains curves of conductors up to 10000 but does *not* contain their generators.  So this is a test whose output will depend on whether or not the optional extended database is installed, something which we have been trying to avoid.

I hope the authors of #11474 (not me!) will be able to say whether I have got this diagnosis right.

The problem was that curve 5077a1 could still be in the cache from an earlier doctest.  In this case the `gens` parameter (in the first failing doctest) would be ignored and the generators would be computed using mwrank.  This commit replaces the curve 5077a1 by 433a1, which is not used in any other doctest.
