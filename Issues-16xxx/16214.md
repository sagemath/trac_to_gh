On top of #16210, there was a problem is `traveling_salesman_problem` for digraphs : the code reordered edges as it was meant for graphs only by applied to generic graphs.

With this fix, the `_scream_if_not_simple` can be removed as the function applies to all graphs.

No you are right, we are not allowed to remove parallel edges when the graph has exactly two vertices.

I cannot express how much I hate to make code messy just because of those #(*&%ô*&%&*(#(*&^ MULTIGRAPHS. Cannot stand that.

No it isn't,my latest comment was a mistake. Because I was thinking of how the code is written, and it made me think that it would return False on the following instance :

```
sage: Graph([(0,1),(0,1)],multiedges=True).is_hamiltonian()
```

Unfortunately, not only does it NOT return "True" as it should, but it produces another bug. And I am sick and tired of fixing bugs for graphs I never ever use, i.e. f**** looped graphs with multiples edges.

It's ugly as hell and I do not know how I could write it better.

Some of the LP below assume that parallel edges will never be used. And this is true, except when the input has exactly two vertices.

1) You forgot graphs on 1 vertex. As I was sure you would complain (and I am a smart guy) I did it.

2) You forgot the graph on 0 vertex. For this one, the hamiltonicity depends on the definition of cycle. For me an empty cycle is a vertex, but this is perhaps not common in the graph community. So please further edit my commit.

3) I am not convinced with

```
weight = lambda l : l if (l is not None and l) else 1
```
First of all as None evaluates to False, hence you can shorten it as

```
weight = lambda l: l if l else 1
```
which I definitely love ;-) On the other hand, it is not written anywhere that if I put a weight 0 and set `use_edge_labels=True` then my `0` will automatically become `1`.

Well... For me a graph with a single vertex and no edges is hamiltonian too. But really I could not care less, I am pretty sure that all softwares implement different conventions. For "order == 0", please return the graph itself. It is just not defined... Actually I would say that for `order < 2` the best is to raise an exception, saying that we have no idea what to do with those inputs ... If there is no clear definition, the best is to tell the user that he should settle the draw by himself.

I am waiting for the doctests... but what about

3) I am not convinced with

```
weight = lambda l : l if (l is not None and l) else 1
```
First of all as None evaluates to False, hence you can shorten it as

```
weight = lambda l: l if l else 1
```
which I definitely love ;-) On the other hand, it is not written anywhere that if I put a weight 0 and set use_edge_labels=True then my 0 will automatically become 1.

The algorithm works with zeroes, with negative numbers, with anything. The Linear Program really do not care what the weights are, as long as they can be converted into floats.

I think that we could live well with 1) (especially since this problem occurs in several different functions). You can chose 2 if you prefer, but some doctests may break.
