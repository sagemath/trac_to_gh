On top of #16210, there was a problem is `traveling_salesman_problem` for digraphs : the code reordered edges as it was meant for graphs only by applied to generic graphs.

With this fix, the `_scream_if_not_simple` can be removed as the function applies to all graphs.

Hmmmmm

sage: G = DiGraph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.add_vertex(0)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,1)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0,2)
sage: G.traveling_salesman_problem(use_edge_labels=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: Density is not well-defined for multigraphs.
```
Please start from the public branch, I started some correction in the doc and added the doctest above (that you **have** to modify).

No you are right, we are not allowed to remove parallel edges when the graph has exactly two vertices.

I cannot express how much I hate to make code messy just because of those #(*&%ô*&%&*(#(*&^ MULTIGRAPHS. Cannot stand that.

My last example is a digraph not a multigraph... isn't it?

No it isn't,my latest comment was a mistake. Because I was thinking of how the code is written, and it made me think that it would return False on the following instance :

```
sage: Graph([(0,1),(0,1)],multiedges=True).is_hamiltonian()
```

Unfortunately, not only does it NOT return "True" as it should, but it produces another bug. And I am sick and tired of fixing bugs for graphs I never ever use, i.e. f**** looped graphs with multiples edges.

It's ugly as hell and I do not know how I could write it better.

Some of the LP below assume that parallel edges will never be used. And this is true, except when the input has exactly two vertices.

1) You forgot graphs on 1 vertex. As I was sure you would complain (and I am a smart guy) I did it.

2) You forgot the graph on 0 vertex. For this one, the hamiltonicity depends on the definition of cycle. For me an empty cycle is a vertex, but this is perhaps not common in the graph community. So please further edit my commit.

3) I am not convinced with

```
weight = lambda l : l if (l is not None and l) else 1
```
First of all as None evaluates to False, hence you can shorten it as

```
weight = lambda l: l if l else 1
```
which I definitely love ;-) On the other hand, it is not written anywhere that if I put a weight 0 and set `use_edge_labels=True` then my `0` will automatically become `1`.

I am waiting for the doctests... but what about

3) I am not convinced with

```
weight = lambda l : l if (l is not None and l) else 1
```
First of all as None evaluates to False, hence you can shorten it as

```
weight = lambda l: l if l else 1
```
which I definitely love ;-) On the other hand, it is not written anywhere that if I put a weight 0 and set use_edge_labels=True then my 0 will automatically become 1.
