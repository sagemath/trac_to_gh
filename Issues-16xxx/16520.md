The lazy import in #2516 uncovered bad imports in `interfaces/maxima_lib.py`. To enable fixing it independently of a review of that ticket a separate ticket is created.

I noticed these executed at runtime (as opposed to module initialization time):

```
+ from sage.rings.rational import Rational
+ from sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element_quadratic import NumberFieldElement_quadratic
+ if isinstance(obj, Rational):
```
That's bad, because these are global assignments. You don't want to do those
again and again. Also, I find it hard to believe that those two modules somehow
refer back to `maxima_lib`.

The following runs at module initialization time anyway. I don't see how `from
...` makes this better than `import sage.symbolic.pynac`. It's not critical, so
I don't really care, apart from the fact that the namespace gets an extra
unnecessary symbol `symbol_table`.

```
+from sage.symbolic.pynac import symbol_table
+max_to_pynac_table = symbol_table['maxima']
```

In general, I have trouble seeing how `maxima_lib` can lead to circular imports,
because `maxima_lib` is an interface and as such gets referenced by virtually
no-one. The only place is `sage.calculus.calculus` and I've very carefully made
sure we don't reference that. Furthermore, even there it's imported lazily, and
for very good reason: Importing `maxima_lib` initializes `ecl` with `maxima`
which takes considerable time.

So I suspect it's not so much a circular import but a bad interaction between
the lazy import of `maxima_lib` and the attempted lazy import of
`hypergeometric`. The proper solution is probably to *not* lazily import
hypergeometric into maxima_lib, but import it plainly there. By the time you're
importing maxima_lib you're already committed to significant initialization
time, so unless hypergeometric does something really strange, I don't expect it
will have a significant effect.

TL;DR: I'm not convinced that this ticket is actually solving a real problem.

*addition:* I think the following gives a strong indication that `maxima_lib` does not have a circular import. The following is supposed to be a complete list of the imports done in `maxima_lib`. A circular import would imply that one of those imports leads to importing `maxima_lib`, which means the `LazyImport` should resolve:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.ring import SR, var
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_abstract import (MaximaAbstract, MaximaAbstractFunction,
....:   MaximaAbstractElement, MaximaAbstractFunctionElement,
....:   MaximaAbstractElementFunction)
sage: import sage.rings.real_double
sage: import sage.symbolic.expression
sage: import sage.functions.trig
sage: import sage.functions.log
sage: import sage.functions.other
sage: import sage.symbolic.integration.integral
sage: from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
sage: from sage.symbolic.ring import is_SymbolicVariable
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
This could just be a stale `LazyImport` proxy, but it's not. Note the runtime needed to compute the hash for the first time. This is indicating the ecl initialization is only run then.

```
sage: %time hash(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
CPU times: user 0.77 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.79 s
Wall time: 0.80 s
-7971541566211231133
```
The symbol is now resolved and indeed, hash is instantaneous:

```
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLib'>
sage: %time hash(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
-7971541566211231133
```
There are stale lazyimport proxies lying around:

```
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: hash(maxima_calculus)
-7971541566211231133
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
That's now #16522
