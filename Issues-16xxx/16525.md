Hmmmmm... I'm sorry but I had forgotten to link this patch with #16430 (which is already reviewed+closed but not in a beta yet). This patch adds a doctest which is changed by the patch we have here, so this patch will not pass tests in Volker's beta unless we fix that doctest.

I will push in a second a commit that merges this branch with the branch of #16430, plus a commit that fixes the bug. I just checked that it passed all long tests.
