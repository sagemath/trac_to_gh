[GCC 4.9.0](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/) has been released on April 22nd 2014.

Due to stricter conformance to the C++ standard, both the current stable release of Sage, 6.1.1, and the current development release, 6.2.beta8, won't build with GCC 4.9.

Luckily only two Sage packages, namely Lcalc (1.23) and PPL (1.1), are affected, and small patches which don't change any functionality are sufficient to let Sage build with the new GCC.  (The same patch(es) apply to both Sage 6.1.1 and 6.2.beta8.)
 

Keywords: PPL ptrdiff_t Lcalc default parameters error C++
