CC:  @nathanncohen

Add a function to build Singer difference set (cyclic difference set using finite projective planes).

At the same time we fix a bug in OA_9_135...

I don't get your function `is_projective_plane_cardinality`. The doc of `sqrtrem` seems to say that `q` is the largest integer such that `q^2<=n`. Why do you increase `q` in a while loop ?

- In `OA_9_135` you remove the definition of `PG2 = set([x*39 for x in range(7)])` but it still appears in the documentation. And it is nice to have an object representing that to describe more clearly what the function does.

  And you repeat this %39 everywhere right now.

- `The set of `GF(q)` lines in `V` is a projective plane`. The set of `(q<sup>3-1)/(q-1)=q</sup>2+q+1` lines ? Either way `GF(q)` is not an integer.

Which we can write easily now that BIBD are a class `:-D`

```
sage: def is_cyclic(BIBD):

....:     repr = [x.cycles() for x in repr]

I will put it back if you prefer. I just remarked that I removed an important comment about PG2 being the set of points = 0 mod 39.

But note that it is faster to test "x%39 == 0" rather than building PG2 and then test "x in PG2".

> - `The set of `GF(q)` lines in `V` is a projective plane`. The set of `(q<sup>3-1)/(q-1)=q</sup>2+q+1` lines ? Either way `GF(q)` is not an integer.


No, `GF(q)` is not a number but a field. It refers to line as line in a vector space over `GF(q)`. The very same way you would speak about `RR` lines in `CC`. Isn't that clear enough?

Your commit does not seem to remove any comment `O_o`

You can remove this PG2 if you want but then you must change the explanation accordingly !

Now try to think : you don't have to USE `is_cyclic` in your function. You have the base block, i.e. `GF(q)-0` in `GF(q^3)-0`, and you can define the automorphism on `GF(q^3)-0` with your generator.

That's what I said in the comment above : the 2-plane is defined by the 1-lines it contains, and the action is an action on 1-lines (which is just a multiplication).

> Nevertheless, it would be nice to have 3.16 done somewhere! But I am not sure that this ticket is the right place.

Hello again !

Sorry but it still is a bit hard for me to read those explanations and I go slowly, it isn't really my world `^^;`

- In the doc of `are_projective_space_parameters` you give the equations that `v,k,lmbda` must satisfy, but could you say it "with words" before that ? Something like "such that the projective geometry of parameters xx,xx,xx is a xx,xx,xx design ?" 

- I had begun to write a commit linking this function with `ProjectiveGeometryDesign` but I did not know enough to finish the review `^^;`

- I do not understand the code yet, but don't you want to use the 'conway=True` trick in `singer_difference_set` ?

Hi,

> - In the doc of `are_projective_space_parameters` you give the equations that `v,k,lmbda` must satisfy, but could you say it "with words" before that ? Something like "such that the projective geometry of parameters xx,xx,xx is a xx,xx,xx design ?" 


will do: these are the parameters of a projective space design (assuming that they only exists for prime powers ;-)
 
> - I had begun to write a commit linking this function with `ProjectiveGeometryDesign` but I did not know enough to finish the review `^^;`


Yeah it would be cool to check the t-design parameters of projective geometry designs fit what `are_projective_space_parameters` check for. Actually, it would make sense to move `are_projective_space_parameters` to `block_design.py`. What do you think?

> - I do not understand the code yet, but don't you want to use the 'conway=True` trick in `singer_difference_set` ?


Nope. I need relative extensions `GF(q) -> GF(q^(d+1))`. The trick would only "work" for prime fields. Moreover, testing if an element of an extension belongs to the span over `GF(q)` of `(1,z,...,z^(d-1))` is a mess (and trivial if you deal directly with polyonials).

I agree that I mimic an extension of `GF(q)` by dealing with polynomials mod `c` (the relative Conway polynomial), but it seems the easiest way to go.

Also : don't we use at the same time "projective space design" and "projective geometry design" ?

It follows Stinson but the loop is stopped sooner.

The field `Kbig` with q<sup>e+1</sup> elements is a vector space over `Ksmall` the one with q elements. We chose a generator z of the multiplicative group of `Kbig` (that way we have a cyclic action on lines). We also choose a concrete subspace of dimension `d` in `Kbig` to be the span (over `Ksmall`) of 1,z,...z<sup>d-1</sup>. Let call it `V` this subspace.

The difference set is by definition the set of integers `i` such that `z^i` belong to `V` (recall that any element of `Kbig` different from `0` can be written as `z^i` with `i < q^e`).

This is what Stinson does and this is what I am doing.

1) You are already computing a logarithm, so it is at most as hard as a for loop. It is only "hard" because these guys measure complexity with respect to `log(n)`

2) It is "hard" to factor stuff, yet there is something "more efficient" that trying all integers smaller than `n` (stop at `sqrt(n)`)

3) It is exactly because it is a useful operation that we should have a function for it. Of course it's not our job to implement it but perhaps we should have a simple way to do that in Sage ?...  `O_o`

If you want to compute the logarithm of a bunch of numbers I am not sure there is something better than trial multiplication... and doing it for each element of your set is definitely a bad idea.

I am pretty sure I studied this at the University

```
sage: sage.groups.generic.bsgs
```

I forgot all of it, though... But I guess it shouldn't be a standalone function like that.
