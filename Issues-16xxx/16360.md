The resultant does not work for function fields if the variable names are not chosen wisely

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: y.resultant(y+x)
PariError: variable must have higher priority in gtopoly
```

The resultant is wrong over extensions of function fields

```
sage: K.<a> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<b> = K[]
sage: L.<b> = K.extension(b^2-a)
sage: R.<x> = L[]
sage: f=x^2-a
sage: g=x-b
sage: f.resultant(g)
-b + a^2 # should be 0 since f and g have the common root b
```
