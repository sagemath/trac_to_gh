```
The ticket adds several new features to Hecke triangle groups (resp. elements):

- "Block" decomposition of elements. This determines the conjugacy type of elements
- Several alternative representation methods for elements
- Lambda-continued fraction expansion of fixed points (exact!)
  In particular the primitive part of a group element can be determined
- Checks and generation of reduced and simple elements, Checks for Hecke symmetry
- Slash operator
- Rational period functions associated to hyperbolic elements (resp. their fixed point)
- class number and class representatives for a given discriminant
  In particular discriminants can be listed, so can all simple/reduced elements
  for a given discriminant
- Linking numbers
- improved documentation and minor additions/modifications

Some remarks:

1. The code to determine class numbers/representatives is very slow at the moment. :-(
2. The case n=infinity is excluded / not supported yet :(

Depends on #16936

Hello Jonas,

It is always a bad choice to make a lot of modifications in one patch (especially because no reviewer will like it). From the description of your ticket, it looks like you would better have 2 or 3.

Some remarks:
- Why did you choose to put the code for triangle groups in `sage.modular.modform_hecketriangle`. As you can see elements of arithmetic groups are in `sage.modular.arithgroup` while the code relative to modular forms is in `sage.modular.modform`. People interested in Hecke groups are not necessarily interested in modular forms.
- As you might have seen, the `ArithmeticSubgroupElement` class inherits directly from `MultiplicativeGroupElement` and not from `MatrixGroupElement_generic`. The reason is performance as most methods of `2x2` matrices (such as det, traces, ...) are much faster using explicit formulas. Moreover, the class for arithmetic group element only have four slots for the elements a,b,c,d which is much simpler than a list of vectors for storing rows.
- Is `string_rep` standard ? I thought that `str` would have been better.
- You must put **useful** tests in the class `HeckeTriangleGroupElement` and move it from the `__init__` method to the main documentation of the class. These examples are here to help the users. In particular, start with code that works, not with potential failure.
- There are too much `cached_method`. In an ideal world there should be none. A python objects takes some amount of RAM, and each cached method stores python objects. Abusing with the `cached_method` implies that you can not deal with huge list of Hecke triangle group element. You should basically remove all of them unless you have a **very** strong argument for having it (e.g. `root_extension_embedding` in `HeckeTriangleGroup`).
- Why do you use the algebraic field `AA` instead of number fields ? It is much slower in all situations. Note that there is a (relatively slow) method for checking that a number is positive: `.is_real_positive`.
- What is the point of the method `m.root_extension_embedding()` ? You may use directly `m.parent().XXX`.

Matrix group operations are used at several places.
I choose MatrixGroupElement_generic because I considered it simpler
/ less error prone than reimplementing all operations.
If it makes a big difference for performance I can try to change it.
What about doing it in a separate ticket?

> - Is `string_rep` standard ? I thought that `str` would have been better.

I used 'string_rep' as a helper function for `_repr_`
(since I have several possible representations) but 'str' would be
fine by me as well (if it isn't used for other purposes).

The way I documented my code I put the main documentation of classes
resp. their usage in the readme.py file.

I tried to remove as many cached_methods as possible without causing a major
performance drop. Some of them would cause an overall 30% drop in performance
(according to doctests at least) if removed. One reason for this is also that
group elements are not uniquely represented, so if the basic elements aren't
cached several expensive calculations on them would be unnecessarily repeated
(in particular simply displaying the element would probably take much longer).

One idea might be to use UniqueRepresentation for elements as well but in this
instance I am not really sure how (resp. what to put in `__classcall__`).
Again this is a change which is not related to the ticket so it could be done in
a separate ticket.

.is_real_positive seems to simply use .n() to numerically decide positivity.
In particular it requires some embedding into e.g. RR or RIF.
I choose  AA as the default embedding because it is the most versatile
base for further embeddings. If I "RR" or "RIF" would be used
then embeddings into AA wouldn't be easily possibly anymore.

I.e. I choose generality/flexibility/versatility over performance.
If performance becomes a big issue my suggestion would be to explicitely
specify an embedding for those cases. E.g. For fixed points (which live
in a relative number field extension) I needed this (in particular
because there is no default embedding) and there is the
root_extension_embedding method for that purpose.

> - What is the point of the method `m.root_extension_embedding()` ? You may

For elements we know the discriminant which is given as an argument to
the parent function.

Hi,

It is standard in Sage to have documentation directly attached to the objects. If there is a need for a larger document that would serve as explanation or tutorial, then it is fine. But it is not where the main documentation should be. Moreover, such document should be listed in the "Thematic tutorials".

I am still not happy with the `cached_method`. If it is long to compute the decomposition into generators from the matrix, then do not make it appear in `_repr_`. It is a nonsense to argue that some methods must be cached because of `__repr__`. Either this decomposition is important for computations, in which case it must be computed at the creation (and in parallel with the matrix multiplication). Or it is not, in which case it does not matter that it is long to compute. This concerns `_basic_data` and `_primitive_bloc_data`. On the other hand, why `continued_fraction` is still cached?

If the information contained in `_basic_data`, `_primitive_bloc_data` and `_continued_fraction` are approximately equivalent, you can choose one of them for being cached. From what I understand:
- `_primitive_block_data`: built from `continued_fraction`
- `_block_data`: generalization of `_primitive_block_data`
so there is for sure no need to cache all of them. And using `UniqueRepresentation` for elements is a bad idea (it will cost too much).

line 2700

```
        .. TODO:

          Improve the documentation!
```
Who will do that?

I do have plenty of other remarks that I can partly implement myself. But I want the one above to be settled before going further.

Hi Vincent,

Thanks a lot for the response. I am sorry that you are so unhappy with the code. :(

Regarding the documentation:
This could be done in a separate ticket (it relates to much more than just this ticket which is already rather large). I followed the advice of Martin Raum when I started, sorry if the documentation is in the wrong spot.

Regarding the cached methods:
Of course this is not about `__repr__` (it only comes into play if the representation method is changed). The result of the cached calculation is rather short compared to the possibly really
long computations to get it (for all examples above). More importantly the cached results are usually reused a lot. So in my opinion the overhead of having a cached method is justified. 

The information in basic_data, primitive_block_data and continued_fractions are (in my opinion) not approximately equivalent. We also don't always cache all methods. Instead different cached method have different use cases (but yes there is some hiearchy between them):

(1) If the full block data is needed (not only _primitive_block_data) then the _block_data caching helps. This is a less used case I guess but still the caching helps a lot for that case. Indeed this will also use _primitive_block_data.

(2) If only _primitive_block_data is needed, we don't need to have the _block_data, _primitive_block_data is enough. For instance "hyperbolic binary quadratic forms" are in 1-1 relation to primitive hyperbolic matrices. So I guess this is the most important case.
Also: Indeed _primitive_block_data relies on continued_fraction.

(3) Block decomposition has a rather specific application (basically determining the conjugacy type). We also want to be able to cache continued fraction calculations (in particular since they're probably most costly of the cached methods) without the need to also add unrelated block decomposition calculations and data. So I left the caching for continued_fraction in place. Note that continued fractions are sometimes enough and no primitive block data is needed.

(4) _basic_data is related to the decomposition of the matrix as a product of its generators S, T.
it is yet another non-equivalent use case. The whole base code is built on the basic decomposition.
For instance it is used to determine if a given matrix even lies in the group. It is used heavily for calculations with modular forms / upper half plane action (to determine the automorphy factor, for calculations involving the fundamental domain or representatives in it). So I decided to always call _basic_data (unless check is disabled in which case nothing is cached by default).

Regarding UniqueRepresentation:
I was just asking about it as an alternative to method caching (I myself also decided against it).


I hope the summary above helped. I understand that you are unhappy with the current implementation.
I am not happy about the idea of further removing cached methods (I did some test a while ago: in each case removing a cached method had significant performance impact). But if it is an absolute requirement I would remove the caching for _block_data and _primitive_block_data. As mentioned this will however have a really large negative performance effect on methods that implicitely use them. :-(

Is the overhead of an unused cache method so large?
If yes, shouldn't the caching mechanism be improved instead?


Regarding the TODO on line 2700:
I added it because I am not familiar enough with all facets of the topic (in particular geometry)
otherwise I would have improved it. But I know it is of interest to some people.
So I guess (unfortunately) nobody will improve it.
Maybe the TODO remark should be removed all together since the current documentation seems acceptable.

If the ticket modifications are better "in" than "out" then my suggestion and hope would be to commit something "close" to the current form and to apply more general modifications beyond the scope of just this ticket at a later time (in a different ticket).


Regards
    Jonas

Hey Jonas,

1) Do you mind the merge with the latest beta? That will avoid me many recompilations. Otherwise, I can rebase my two commits.

2) I wrote a commit that just clean the code. Nothing big, but a little speed up. Tell me what you think.

3) Concerning the cached_method, I decided to let only two of them (`continued_fraction` and `_primitive_block_data`) after intensive timings of the doctests. See below. Please tell me if this is really bad.

Potential caching

1. continued_fraction
2. _block_data
3. _primitive_block_data
4. primitive_power
5. _basic_data

| cached methods | time    | relative gain   |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|
| none             | 102.0s    |                   |
| all              |  57.8 s   | 43%               |
| 1                |  75.0 s   | 26%               |
| 2                |  79.1 s   | 22%               | 
| 3                |  82.4 s   | 17%               |
| 4                |  88.0 s   | 13%               |
| 5                |  98.0 s   | 4%                |
| 1 + 3            |  64.2 s   | 14% (rel to 1)    |
| 2 + 3            |  76.0 s   | 4% (rel to 2)     |
| 1 + 2            |  67.7 s   | 9% (rel to 1)     |
| 1 + 2 + 3        |  62.3 s   | 3% (rel to 1+3)   |

So 1+3 is is a 10% lost compared to 1+2+3+4+5... but I would say that removing 3 cached_method is much more!

4) I really do not understand your naming scheme. Why `decompose_basic` and not `word_decomposition_S_T` or `word_S_T` or something that tells you about what it does? The same is true for many methods: `_primitive_block_data`, `_block_data`, `_basic_data`, `block_length`, `decompose_block`.

5) For some other methods, I was not able to understand what they do... the documentation is by far too short for me. In particular `reduced_elements` and `simple_elements`.

I am waiting for your comments before going further.

Vincent

Hey Vincent,

1) I don't mind at all.

2) Thanks a lot. I checked all the changes very closely. They look great! :-)
 I made some small adjustments:
- For Hecke triangle groups k is usually a rational number,
  so k = ZZ(k) quite often fails and we want to provide the same
  exception message

- I pulled the factor ZZ(-1) factor out of (-Q) again. It produces
  better looking numerators/denominators and it emphasizes the
  form resp. sign of the factor.

- I used "u = sum((v[0]-1) for v in L)", some authors use "v[0]-1"
  instead of "v[0]" in their definitions, so it feels more natural
  to me that way.

- For now I added 2 cached_methods back (and ideally I would like to add
  _block_data too).

3) Thanks for the test, I didn't write mine down unfortunately.
 "but I would say that removing 3 cached_method is much more!":
 Can you maybe elaborate a bit more on the drawbacks/overheads with (unused)
 cached_methods? How large is the overhead? The tests (in particular
 interactive usages) seem to only indicate positive effects from caching.
 I would prefer to keep the cached methods in:

- primitive_power: I would really prefer to keep this a cached_method.
  It only stores one integer and the calculation of it can be long:
  Basically the method compares powers of the primitive part against the
  original matrix until it finds a match. Also that method is reused to
  e.g. determine if a matrix is primitive. Which is again reused by other
  functions. Moreover the primitive_power is a number of interest for a
  given matrix. Caching only occurs if the method is used.
  In my opinion this is a perfect example of something worthwhile to cache.
  Also note that most doctests involve only small powers of matrices and there
  are much slower functions which have more influence on the total time in doctests...

- _basic_data: This method is a candidate to be removed. It is the only cached
  method which is always called, so disabled caching would reduce the overhead.
  The calculation of it basically involves determening a representative of a
  number/matrix in the fundamental domain, which can take very long if the number
  lies close to "1". So why not cache the result? It is also beeing used for
  calculations of automorphy factors for modular forms. So if matrices are beeing
  reused there in modular operations caching could give a big speed up. It's also
  used for "basic" string representations which is a very good candidate for the
  default representation of matrices (just saying). So it seems like a waste to
  compute _basic_data repeatedly (and having to wait for the output). The user
  experience is improved a lot if he has fast response time to his commands.
  Without caching "basic" representation might be too "laggy" to use comfortably.
  Note that when doing calculations one usually uses "basic", "conj" or "block"
  for representations (so the results can immediately be interpreted). Caching
  has a large (positive) effect for such calculations.
  I would keep it in, but yes it's definitely a candidate for removal.

- _block_data: I don't think there are many test cases which reuse block data.
  If matrices and their block data are beeing reused several times caching might
  be a big issue. As for _basic_data the user experience with string representations
  ("conj" or "block") should at least be considered. Again: I would keep it in,
  but yes it's a candidate for removal.

 All in all I also wouldn't neglect the impact on user experience from fast/slow representations.
 If you insist on removing the cached methods I will accept it however.

4) I tried to improve the wording slightly. "Block length" is a term used in papers.

5) I added more remarks (see is_primitive and is_simple). The terms basically relate
 1-1 to the corresponding terms for the associated fixed points respectively the
 associated binary quadratic form (at least in the hyperbolic case). The methods
 reduced_elements resp. simple_elements return all corresponding elements in the
 conjugacy class of the given element. Ideally those should be member functions
 for conjugacy classes. But those aren't implemented yet (and probably will
 never be). :(

Hi again

I would like to finnish / apply this ticket.
If the cached_method are the blocker, what about a compromise:
Leave primitive_power as a cached_method but remove _word_S_T_data?
If that's still not enough I'm also willing to remove both if it helps
to finnish the review.
