As discussed in #11474 , SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field is not really a group, but it should be !

However, note that the class of the points of an elliptic curve inherits from AdditiveGroupElement.

Note that there are two distinct but related ways in which objects of type `SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field` "are not groups":
- the class `SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field` itself does not inherit from `sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_class`;
- if `A` is an instance of `SchemeHomset_points_abelian_variety_field`, the list of categories returned by `A.categories()` does not include "Category of commutative groups" (i.e. the category obtained as `Groups().Commutative()`), let alone "Category of groups" (i.e. `Groups()`).
Both points are probably easy to fix, but it would also be good to have an example of (a) concrete new feature(s) that this would introduce.
