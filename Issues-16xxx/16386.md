/home/ralf/sage-6.2-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/matchpoly.so in sage.graphs.matchpoly.matching_polynomial (sage/graphs/matchpoly.c:2718)()

TypeError: an integer is required
```
The same with `matching_polynomial(graphs.Grid2dGraph(3,3))`.

You need first to rebabel the graph

```
sage: g = graphs.Grid2dGraph(4,4)
sage: g.relabel()
sage: g.matching_polynomial()
x^16 - 24*x^14 + 224*x^12 - 1044*x^10 + 2593*x^8 - 3388*x^6 + 2150*x^4 - 552*x^2 + 36
```
Its probably because the matching polynomial assumes that vertices are integers.
