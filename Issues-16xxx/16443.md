Strange problem:

```
from sage.categories.category_types import Category_over_base_ring

class A(Category_over_base_ring):
    
    def super_categories(self):
        R = self.base_ring()
        return [Algebras(R]
        #return [Modules(R)]
    
class B(UniqueRepresentation, Parent):
    
    def __init__(self, R):
        Parent.__init__(self, category=A(R))
```
That fails! (6.2 rc 2):

```
sage: B(QQ)
...
TypeError: None is not in Category of rings
```

But if I try to change the super categories:

```
Algebras(R) --> Modules(R)
```

That works! What's error mean?

It in fact does not work either: a parent in `Modules(...)` should
implement a base_ring method. This method just turns out not to be
called upon initialization if B is just in `Modules()` instead of
`Algebras()`, so the problem goes undetected, so far ...

It indeed feels a bit redundant to have to specify the base ring in
the category *and* in the `base_ring` method. The thing is that, in the
category, one can now specify something like `Algebras(Rings())`; I'd
say it's even recommended. So one can't recover the base ring from the
just the category. It's not so bad, because more often than not, when
implementing a module, one inherits from some preexisting module that
implements `base_ring` for us.

Now, yes, definitely, this all might not be stated explicitly in the
documentation; and the error message is not informative ...

Step that can be taken right away:

- add a `base_ring` abstract method in `Modules.ParentMethods`

Steps that are a bit more tricky (I tried and dropped the case; but I
had to act fast then to get #10963 in):

- Remove the `base_ring` method from `CategoryObject` (it has nothing to
  do there).

- Implement a `base_ring` method for all the existing modules
  (polynomials, ...), putting it in common abstract super classes
  whenever possible.

Cheers,
                                       Nicolas
