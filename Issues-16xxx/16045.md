The volume currently does not distinguish between ambient and induced volume. This should be changed.

Different engine yield very different results, and example:
The lrs engine for polytope volume calculates volume respective to the dimension of the polytope,
while the auto engine calculates volume respective to the dimension of the ambient space.

Example:


```
m3 = matrix(ZZ, [[0,0,0],[0,0,1]])
p = Polyhedron(m3)
p.volume(engine="lrs")
p.volume()

1.0
0
```

(Note: The lrs allows calculation of volumes of facets without reducing the dimension of the ambient space, but it uses non-isometrical projections!)

The suggested resolution adds a parameter `measure` that essentially behaves as follows:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[0, 0], [1, 1]])
sage: P.volume()
0
sage: P.volume(measure='induced')                                                                                                                                   
sqrt(2)
sage: P.volume(measure='induced_rational') # optional -- latte_int
1
```

what is a rational polytope? defined over rationals?

At least I could not get from documentation that using engine="lrs"
implies  calculates volume respective to the dimension of the polytope
and using 'auto' implies calculating volume respective to the dimension of the ambient space,
so for me it is a wrong answer issue.

This is actually very useful to have this. (I was actually looking for such a function just now).

It should perhaps be better documented with an optional parameter to switch this on and off and let `lrs` compute the volume of faces.

I agree, a keyword parameter that controls the measure used for lower-dim faces would be useful.
There are currently 3 options:

- 0
- answer according to standard lower-dim measure
- LattE always returns a rational answer, by normalizing with respect to the intersection lattice.

It is a troolean (at least for rational polytopes) as mentioned in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) of Marcelo.

>  - Should the default for the parameter (if none is given) depend on the `engine` chosen? 


No.

>  - What should happen if the `engine` is not able to compute the inherent volume?


A `ValueError` or a `RuntimeError`.

So how about the following solve the problem:

We introduce a parameter "measure" with the following options:

- "ambient" (the default?!)
- "induced" 
- "latte_renormalized" (or something that Matthias likes)

I suppose it would be wisest to catch measure="ambient" if the polytope is not full-dimensional and return "0" for all the engines (Even if the engines only can compute the induced volume of the polytope)

Should it could work like:

```
sage: m3 = matrix(ZZ, [[0,0,0],[0,0,1]])
sage: p = Polyhedron(m3)
sage: p.volume()
0
sage: p.volume(engine="lrs", measure="induced")
1.0
sage: p.volume(engine="lrs", measure="ambient")
0
sage: p.volume(measure="induced")
ValueError or a RuntimeError: "Please choose a different engine."
```

Maybe it would be ok to choose a differnt engine for the last command automatically.

What do you think?

Note that "latte_renormalized" only make sense for polyhedron defined over Q. I guess it would be better `"induced_rational"` rather than any reference to latte. This renormalization is very natural.

+1. I also do not like the behavior of the last command. The default choice of the engine should take into account the `measure` argument (which should be firt BTW).

I am building on #20887 and introduced a `measure` option.

Here is a test (make sure ou have latte_int, topcom and lrs installed)

```
sage: C = polytopes.cube()
sage: P = polytopes.permutahedron(4)
sage: P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 24 vertices
sage: measures = ["ambient", "induced", "induced_rational"]
sage: engines = ["auto", "internal", "TOPCOM", "lrs", "latte"]
sage: for m in measures:
....:     for e in engines:
....:         try:
....:             pvol = P.volume(measure=m, engine=e)
....:         except TypeError as err:
....:             pvol = err
....:         try:
....:             cvol = C.volume(measure=m, engine=e)
....:         except Exception as err:
....:             cvol = err
....:         print 'measure =',m, 'engine =',e 
....:         print 'not-fulldimensional example: ', pvol
....:         print 'full-dimensional example: ', cvol
....:         print '--------------'
....:         
measure = ambient engine = auto
not-fulldimensional example:  0
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
measure = ambient engine = internal

full-dimensional example:  8.0
--------------
measure = induced engine = internal
not-fulldimensional example:  The induced measure can only be computed with the engine set to `auto` or `lrs`
full-dimensional example:  8.0
--------------
measure = induced engine = TOPCOM

--------------
measure = induced_rational engine = auto
not-fulldimensional example:  16
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
measure = induced_rational engine = internal
not-fulldimensional example:  The induced rational measure can only be computed with the engine set to `auto` or `latte`
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
measure = induced_rational engine = TOPCOM
not-fulldimensional example:  The induced rational measure can only be computed with the engine set to `auto` or `latte`
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
measure = induced_rational engine = lrs
not-fulldimensional example:  The induced rational measure can only be computed with the engine set to `auto` or `latte`
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
measure = induced_rational engine = latte
not-fulldimensional example:  16
full-dimensional example:  8
--------------
```


The options are explained as 

```
        - ``measure`` -- string. The measure to use. Allowed values are:

          * ``ambient``: Lebesgue measure of ambient space (volume)
          * ``induced``: Lebesgue measure of affine hull (relative volume)
          * ``induced_rational``: TODO: explanation (only makes sense for integer polytopes?!)

        - ``engine`` -- string. The backend to use. Allowed values are:

          * ``'auto'`` (default): choose engine according to measure
          * ``'internal'``: see :meth:`triangulate`.
          * ``'TOPCOM'``: see :meth:`triangulate`.
          * ``'lrs'``: use David Avis's lrs program (optional).
          * ``'latte'``: use LattE integrale program (optional).
```

What could I write for `induced_rational`?

I have not yet added doctests.

Comments welcome!

I noticed that "lrs" is in fact **not** computing the Lebesgue measure of the affine hull. Form the lrs web-page: 


  If the option is applied to a V-representation of  a polytope that is not full dimensional, the volume of a projected polytope is computed. The projection used is to the lexicographically smallest coordinate subspace, see Avis, Fukuda, Picozzi (2002).  


In fact, this shows already in one of the old doctests:

```
sage: I = Polyhedron([(0,0), (1,1)])
sage: I.volume(engine='lrs') #optional - lrslib
1.0
```
The result with the induced measure should be `sqrt(2)` (or `1.414213562373095` I guess)

So this should not be used to compute the volume of facets, as mentioned in [comment:2](#comment%3A2) !

In any case I still think it would be useful to have the option for this measure, except that at the moment, none of the engines is able to actually compute appropriate induced volumes. 

Perhaps it would be useful to open a ticket to ask for a function, that does compute the induced measure?! A naive implementation could choose an affine basis of vertices and then some isometry.

It would be nice to have an explanation of these subtleties in the doc of the function (as shown by Moritz). Consequently, the issue described in the ticket would be resolved so as to address the reason why it returns different results.

IMHO, I guess it is okay to have one method returning different results depending on the value of the parameters. So +1 to have an optional parameter which specifies the measure (and hence the engine in some cases) as Vincent mentionned.

Finally, add a TODO that would ask for the lebesgue measure which would be addressed in a separate ticket and explain what `lrs` is doing with a possible link to the webpage.

What do you think?

One thing that would be useful to have, would be a function, that takes a non full-dimensional poytope and returns a full-dimensional one that is affinely equivalent to the original one. Note that the usual `.affine_hull` method does not achive that goal:

```
sage: p = Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: p.affine_hull()
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: p.affine_hull().vertices()
(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (1))
```
The length of the affine hull is not `sqrt(2)` as one might expect. Another example would be 

``` 
sage: s = polytopes.simplex()
sage: s
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
sage: s.affine_hull()
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
sage: _.show()
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
Here the simplex is not regular after using `.affine_hull`. 

Consider this new `affine_hull` function:

```
def affine_hull(P, preserve_volume=True):
    if P.ambient_dim() == P.dim():
        return P
    Q = P.translation(-vector(P.vertices()[0]))
    v = Q.vertices()[0]
    assert list(v) == P.ambient_dim()*[0]
    import itertools
    M = Matrix([list(w) for w in itertools.islice(v.neighbors(), P.dim())])
    if P.base_ring() in [ZZ,QQ]:
        M = Matrix(AA,M)
    A = M.gram_schmidt(orthonormal = True)[0]
    return Polyhedron([A*vector(v) for v in Q.vertices()])
```


Using this gets the desired results:

```
sage: p = Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: affine_hull(p)
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in AA^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: affine_hull(p).vertices()
(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (1.414213562373095?))
```
It is actually useful to plot the permutahedron nicely:

```

 (There is an inherent problem, that considering a rational polytope as full-dimensional polytope in its affine hull might lead to non-rational polyopes: basically you want to work in a field with square roots.)

In any case I propose to introduce an improved version of the `.affine_hull` method, perhaps with an parameter `preserve_volume=True` (or `isometry=True`) an then use this method to handle the cases of the volume of non full-dimenional polytopes here. 


What do you think?

I agree that it would be useful and essentially straightforward (ignoring details about base ring). You can open a **new** ticket and move the discussion there.

I opened #22804 and already added some code. This could eventually become a depency here (#16045) and we can end up with a '.volume' method that is more useful...

Hi Moritz,

Small comments:

- In the doc: `measure.Different engines`   (add space)
- Further, right after this sentence, could there be a short sentence, maybe as a note, to say what "for lattice polytope" means exactly?.
- For the example, `P = Polyhedron([[0, 0], [1, 1]])` I would also add the output with the parameter `induced_rational`. This will make it contrast right away, rather than waiting for polyhedron `I`. (It is minor but very instructive).
-  Perhaps name the second polyhedron `P` differently.
- `if polyhedron is actually full-dimensional, return volume with ambient measuren` (remove the `n` at the end).

You have some failed tests:

```
    **********************************************************************
File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py", line 4373, in sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.volume

Thanks for the comments, JP!

I fixed everything, except perhaps the following; where I was not quite sure what is going on. (Perhaps somehow different machines have different ideas what a real double is..)

```
    w = Dinexact.faces(2)[0].as_polyhedron().volume(measure='induced', engine='internal'); w
Expected:
    1.534062710738235
Got:
    1.5340627107382352
```

I hope I managed to add `# optional -- latte_int` in all relevant places: I didn't test it without `latte_int` installed.

There is a hidden failed test (probably got caught by chance by the bot):

Question: I have "normaliz" in my optional installed packages but not "pynormaliz", is the above naming correct then?

I am aware that this is not the topic of this ticket but since the tests failed here, it is probably best to treat this here.

The only way that sage accesses normaliz is via pynormaliz, so this is correct.

I disagree. This should not be treated here, but a new ticket should be opened. If we proceed as you propose (and everybody else does the same), this random pynormaliz bug will be treated in every ticket that is around. 

In fact it already seems to be fixed here:

All right, good to know, thanks for looking it up!

Should we add a dependancy in such cases, or perhaps just wait...?

I corrected two indentations. This looks good to me now, tests pass on my machine with pynormaliz (!).

I extended the description of the ticket a bit, if you believe it should contain some more information you can add it, otherwise, I'd it is ready to go.
