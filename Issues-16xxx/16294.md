This probably isn't ready for prime time since I should pull a specific version rather than just tip.  When that is changed I'll need to update the checksums as well.  

It would be nice to have some feedback as to whether this is even close to the right method of doing things for new-style spkg's though.

Looks good. `spkg-src` is just an (optional) way of documenting how to create the tarball. Since it never gets run automatically it is fine to pull tip imho.

You need to link to the actual tarball in the ticket description.
