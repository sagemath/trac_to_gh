We just replace the name with its lower case version `balanced_incomplete_block_design` and set a deprecation warning for the upper case one.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Yo !

You should use `deprecated_function_alias` for things like that :

```
+# deprecated in june 2014 (#16446)
+def BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(v,k,existence=False,use_LJCR=False):
```

Besides this, it's fine.
