The functions in `sage.combinat.designs` that try to build a design with given parameters are by convention lower case... excepted `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`. We just replace the name with its lower case version `balanced_incomplete_block_design` and set a deprecation warning for the upper case one.

You can rewrite this if you want. Ticket #16347 used to be a mess of dependencies but it only takes one commit now, and it shouldn't conflict with this one.

Yo !

You should use `deprecated_function_alias` for things like that :

```
+# deprecated in june 2014 (#16446)
+def BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(v,k,existence=False,use_LJCR=False):
```

Besides this, it's fine.
