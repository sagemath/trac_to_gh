```
Adds series reversion for integer and rational flint polynomials
which is much faster than the current implementation for series
reversion (sage/pari).

Since it is implemented as a method for polynomials the change is
rather small and non-intrusive (in particular it doesn't require
to implement power series using flint).

To use it for power series reversion (at the moment) the series has
to be converted to a (flint) polynomial first, reverted using
"revert_series(n=prec)" and later be converted back to a power series.

Acknowledgements: Thanks for the help on IRC!

Hello,

I have made a new branch based on yours, with a few small cleanup changes.

You have to put your real name in the `author` field of the ticket (here above).

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
A few remarks:
* this looks strange:

```
...revert_series(5+1)
```
why not put 6 in there?
* please beautify the docstring `f(self(x)) = ...` using sphinx syntax.
* the variable name of the power series could be used in `and +1 or -1 as the coefficient for x^1`
* please put `sig_on/sig_off` around the calls to the FLINT C function calls (unless you're sure it will always be super fast, but I fear it won't be the case for series with a large number of terms/polynomials of high degree).
