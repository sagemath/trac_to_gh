The following two classes were introduced almost simultaneously:
- `sage.sets.real_set.RealSet` in #13125, which implements finite unions of open/closed/semi-closed intervals;
- `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.height.UnionOfIntervals` in #8828, which has a more restricted scope (only unions of closed intervals).
It would be reasonable if these two classes were merged, and if all the functionality of `UnionOfIntervals` that is not yet in `RealSet` were moved there (e.g. scaling, computing the endpoints/boundary).

Looking briefly at the code, `UnionOfIntervals` is somewhat more specialized, and so it is likely is faster than the more generic (and [indirectly] in the global namespace) `InternalRealInterval`. I'm not convinced that we should remove `UnionOfIntervals` unless there is not a speed regression (or it is minor).

However, I am +1 for unifying the behavior of these two classes. If you feel that you are having to duplicate some of the normalization code, then it might be better to try and refactor it because of the new use-case you have.
