The following two classes were introduced almost simultaneously:
- `sage.sets.real_set.RealSet` in #13125, which implements finite unions of open/closed/semi-closed intervals;
- `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.height.UnionOfIntervals` in #8828, which has a more restricted scope (only unions of closed intervals).
It would be reasonable if these two classes were merged, and if all the functionality of `UnionOfIntervals` that is not yet in `RealSet` were moved there (e.g. scaling, computing the endpoints/boundary).

Depends on #8828

Depends on #13125

+1 The UnionOfIntervals was written for one specific application where timing is very important.
