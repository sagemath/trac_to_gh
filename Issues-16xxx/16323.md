Heeeeeere it is ! At long last. We can build all BIBD with k=5 thanks to this construction :
http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

As usual no design is returned without being checked first, so the code is extremely safe.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hi Nathann,

Perhaps not everything for that ticket but I would like to discuss several points.

1) `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` is upper case whereas we start to agree on lower case would be for "build me one if you know how to" and CamelCase would be for "build me this precise design". Should I open a ticket for that ?

2) BIBD errors are not smart (compared to TD/OA/MOLS)

```
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(5,6)
...
ValueError: No such design exists !
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,6)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
sage: D=designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,5)
...
EmptySetError: No Transversal Design exists when k>=n+2 if n>=2
```

3) It would be nice to have `BIBD_from_difference_family` as a public function as it
may serve other purposes. Moreover, the `G(x if some_reason else [x])` is
ugly.  I know it is because of `AdditiveAbelianGroup` but it is ugly. There are
ways to avoid that (e.g. use `Zmod` for cyclic groups instead of
`AdditiveAbelianGroup`). For that particular point, I do have implementation that smooth everything in u/vdelecroix/16323.

4) More generally, there are recursive strategies to build difference family and
difference matrices... it would be nice to have functions

```
def difference_family(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference family if we know how to...
    """

def difference_matrix(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference matrix if we know how to... 
    """"
```
And moreover, such function might be used to simplify the database.

5) (not very helpful comment) For v=81, one can write in shorter form

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([3]*4)
sage: a,b,c,d = G.gens()
sage: D = [[d,    -a+d,  -c+d,    a-b-d,   b+c+d],
....:      [c,    -b+c,   a+b-d,  a-b+d,   a+b+c],
....:      [a+b,  -a+c-d, b-c+d,  a-b-c-d, -a-b+c+d],
....:      [-b-d,  a+b+d, a-b+c, -b+c+d,    a-b+c-d]]
```
Moreover, writing that way it avoids the conversion from tuple to elements of
the group G.

Well, the first one is correct, I am pretty sure I fixed the second somewhere but let's fix it again here, and the third one is really a mistake. I will write a ticket for the last two bugs in a second

Yes. But you know, it REALLY is because of `AdditiveAbelianGroup` ! Anyway now we have real cartesian products, I will use that.

Oh... But Zmod is ugly too, because you have to change the way you think of the code.. We can use cartesian products now that we have them !

I know nothing about ways to build difference families and differences matrices.

For the `BIBD_from_difference_family` there is now a proper documentation. I also learn that there are some constructions of Wilson, Baratti and Abel-Baratti to build difference families.

I still have the Zmod in my branch and I do not know if you want to get rid of them.

I bet that there are some PBD constructions in the Handbook... We should keep in mind to reuse this code at some point.

Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).

I found the work done in the branch is enough for the ticket so I set to positive review.

We should keep in mind to reuse this code at some point.\n\n\nIndeed, but my fear with PBD construction is that it may become harder to detect if we can build one. I mean.. If you have a `(100,[4,6,8])-PBD` and a `(6,[3])-PBD` then you have also a `(100,[3,4,8])-PBD`, stuff like that. You can really mix a lot of different things there, soooo... Well. It may be tricky. We will do it, but it will be tricky to do it well.\n\n> I do not care too much. But, when I opened the file the first time it was difficult to found the logic.\n\n\nAHahah. ALl this is there for \"historical reasons\" I fear. Implemented one after the other. I expect that it will be cleaned several times in the future.\n\n> Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).\n\n\nIndeed, but Julian R. Abel told me that some recursive construction may be by itself sufficient to generate all (v,6,1)-BIBD with v>1000. Looks like when you have a lot of recursive construction you can do almost everything, and that some base cases will be the only missing things afterwards.\n\nAhahaah.\n\nThe point is that it is all a lot of work, and all an interesting work too. And I would like to add it someday, but for the moment I would like to finish implementing all the OA/TD/MOLS related code.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Yo !!

Thanks for the review !

> I bet that there are some PBD constructions in the Handbook... We should keep in mind to reuse this code at some point.


Indeed, but my fear with PBD construction is that it may become harder to detect if we can build one. I mean.. If you have a `(100,[4,6,8])-PBD` and a `(6,[3])-PBD` then you have also a `(100,[3,4,8])-PBD`, stuff like that. You can really mix a lot of different things there, soooo... Well. It may be tricky. We will do it, but it will be tricky to do it well.

AHahah. ALl this is there for "historical reasons" I fear. Implemented one after the other. I expect that it will be cleaned several times in the future.

> Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).


Indeed, but Julian R. Abel told me that some recursive construction may be by itself sufficient to generate all (v,6,1)-BIBD with v>1000. Looks like when you have a lot of recursive construction you can do almost everything, and that some base cases will be the only missing things afterwards.

Ahahaah.

The point is that it is all a lot of work, and all an interesting work too. And I would like to add it someday, but for the moment I would like to finish implementing all the OA/TD/MOLS related code. I have some new constructions to add but I did not write the branch yet for it would depend on other tickets, and I am pretty sure that the main functions I need will be rewritten and changed during the reviews, so I don't dare write this yet as it will mean a lot of rebase. But when the OA/TD/MOLS stuff will be done, both PBD and BIBD with larger blocks will be on the table.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaanks ! I will write to the author of the pdf file tomorrow `:-)`
