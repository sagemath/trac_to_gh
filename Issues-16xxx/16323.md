Heeeeeere it is ! At long last. We can build all BIBD with k=5 thanks to this construction :
http://www.argilo.net/files/bibd.pdf

As usual no design is returned without being checked first, so the code is extremely safe.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>\nHi Nathann,\n\nPerhaps not everything for that ticket but I would like to discuss several points.\n\n1) `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` is upper case whereas we start to agree on lower case would be for \"build me one if you know how to\" and CamelCase would be for \"build me this precise design\". Should I open a ticket for that ?\n\n2) BIBD errors are not smart (compared to TD/OA/MOLS)\n\n```\nsage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(5,6)\n...\nValueError: No such design exists !\nsage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,6)\n...\nRuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object\nsage: D=designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,5)\n...\nEmptySetError: No Transversal Design exists when k>=n+2 if n>=2\n```\n\n3) It would be nice to have `BIBD_from_difference_family` as a public function as it\nmay serve other purposes.

Hi Nathann,

Perhaps not everything for that ticket but I would like to discuss several points.

1) `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` is upper case whereas we start to agree on lower case would be for "build me one if you know how to" and CamelCase would be for "build me this precise design". Should I open a ticket for that ?

2) BIBD errors are not smart (compared to TD/OA/MOLS)

```
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(5,6)
...
ValueError: No such design exists !
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,6)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
sage: D=designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,5)
...
EmptySetError: No Transversal Design exists when k>=n+2 if n>=2
```

3) It would be nice to have `BIBD_from_difference_family` as a public function as it
may serve other purposes. Moreover, the `G(x if some_reason else [x])` is
ugly.  I know it is because of `AdditiveAbelianGroup` but it is ugly. There are
ways to avoid that (e.g. use `Zmod` for cyclic groups instead of
`AdditiveAbelianGroup`). For that particular point, I do have implementation that smooth everything in u/vdelecroix/16323.

4) More generally, there are recursive strategies to build difference family and
difference matrices... it would be nice to have functions

```
def difference_family(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference family if we know how to...
    """

def difference_matrix(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference matrix if we know how to... 
    """"
```
And moreover, such function might be used to simplify the database.

5) (not very helpful comment) For v=81, one can write in shorter form

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([3]*4)
sage: a,b,c,d = G.gens()
sage: D = [[d,    -a+d,  -c+d,    a-b-d,   b+c+d],
....:      [c,    -b+c,   a+b-d,  a-b+d,   a+b+c],
....:      [a+b,  -a+c-d, b-c+d,  a-b-c-d, -a-b+c+d],
....:      [-b-d,  a+b+d, a-b+c, -b+c+d,    a-b+c-d]]
```
Moreover, writing that way it avoids the conversion from tuple to elements of
the group G.

Hello !

You mean that if we had a constructor for PBD we could call it from the BIBD constructor using BIBD_from_PBD ? It is true, but we have no PBD constructor at the moment. Besides the two PBD constructors we already have we could add a PBD_from_TD, stuff like that, indeed.

Move stuff around if you want. As far as I am concerned, it is totally pointless. This being said, some of those functions are together in the code because I implemented the, following the same reference, so if you move them apart please leave them linked together somehow.

I bet that there are some PBD constructions in the Handbook... We should keep in mind to reuse this code at some point.

Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).

I found the work done in the branch is enough for the ticket so I set to positive review.
