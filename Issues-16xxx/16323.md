Hi Nathann,

Perhaps not everything for that ticket but I would like to discuss several points.

1) `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` is upper case whereas we start to agree on lower case would be for "build me one if you know how to" and CamelCase would be for "build me this precise design". Should I open a ticket for that ?

2) BIBD errors are not smart (compared to TD/OA/MOLS)

```
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(5,6)
...
ValueError: No such design exists !
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,6)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
sage: D=designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,5)
...
EmptySetError: No Transversal Design exists when k>=n+2 if n>=2
```

3) It would be nice to have `BIBD_from_difference_family` as a public function as it
may serve other purposes. Moreover, the `G(x if some_reason else [x])` is
ugly.  I know it is because of `AdditiveAbelianGroup` but it is ugly. There are
ways to avoid that (e.g. use `Zmod` for cyclic groups instead of
`AdditiveAbelianGroup`). For that particular point, I do have implementation that smooth everything in u/vdelecroix/16323.

4) More generally, there are recursive strategies to build difference family and
difference matrices... it would be nice to have functions

```
def difference_family(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference family if we know how to...
    """

def difference_matrix(G, k, l=1, existence=False):
    r"""
    Return a (G,k,l)-difference matrix if we know how to... 
    """"
```
And moreover, such function might be used to simplify the database.

5) (not very helpful comment) For v=81, one can write in shorter form

```
sage: G = AdditiveAbelianGroup([3]*4)
sage: a,b,c,d = G.gens()
sage: D = [[d,    -a+d,  -c+d,    a-b-d,   b+c+d],
....:      [c,    -b+c,   a+b-d,  a-b+d,   a+b+c],
....:      [a+b,  -a+c-d, b-c+d,  a-b-c-d, -a-b+c+d],
....:      [-b-d,  a+b+d, a-b+c, -b+c+d,    a-b+c-d]]
```
Moreover, writing that way it avoids the conversion from tuple to elements of
the group G.

Well, the first one is correct, I am pretty sure I fixed the second somewhere but let's fix it again here, and the third one is really a mistake. I will write a ticket for the last two bugs in a second

Hi Nathann,

I did the modif in my branch. I also put the case `v == k` before since `[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)` is a valid BIBD(1,1), isn't it?

sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(1,6)

```

For the `BIBD_from_difference_family` there is now a proper documentation. I also learn that there are some constructions of Wilson, Baratti and Abel-Baratti to build difference families.

I still have the Zmod in my branch and I do not know if you want to get rid of them.

Hi Nathann,

I did the correction. Furthermore, there was a typo in the main BIBD (a `n` was used instead of a `v`).

Now that I read more carefully the code:
- why the construction using PBD can not be used from the main BIBD function? In particular, considering organization, I would like to see the functions `BIBD_from_PBD`, `_check_PBD`, `_relabel_BIBD`, `PBD_4_5_8_9_12`, `_PBD_4_5_8_9_12_closure`, `PBD_from_TD` much higher in the file, i.e. neither in the part "(v,4,1)-BIBD" nor in the part "(v,5,1)-BIBD".
- More generally, the functions `steiner_triple_system`, `v_4_1_BIBD` and `v_5_1_BIBD` currently follow various proofs. But we only care about constructing the BIBD and not checking the proofs, doesn't we? We certainly "check" the proof in the doctests but wouldn't it be possible to write in the main BIBD:

  ```
  if database.BIBD[v,k]:
      ...
  elif construction1(v,k,existence=True):
      ...
  elif construction2(v,k,existence=True):
      ...
  ```
  and getting rid of `steiner_triple_system`, `v_4_1_BIBD` and `v_5_1_BIBD`? I understand that it would be a dramatical change, so do not answer considering it as a task for that ticket.

Hello !

You mean that if we had a constructor for PBD we could call it from the BIBD constructor using BIBD_from_PBD ? It is true, but we have no PBD constructor at the moment. Besides the two PBD constructors we already have we could add a PBD_from_TD, stuff like that, indeed.

Move stuff around if you want. As far as I am concerned, it is totally pointless. This being said, some of those functions are together in the code because I implemented the, following the same reference, so if you move them apart please leave them linked together somehow.

Hmmmmm...

The original code for BIBD with k=5 was actually much larger... #16279 is one of these parts.

Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).

I found the work done in the branch is enough for the ticket so I set to positive review.

Indeed, but my fear with PBD construction is that it may become harder to detect if we can build one. I mean..

AHahah. ALl this is there for "historical reasons" I fear. Implemented one after the other. I expect that it will be cleaned several times in the future.

> Indeed, this was my main question. (I had a look at various paper about difference families, and there are a lot about k=3,4,5, very few about k=6 and almost none about k>=7; excepted existence result for very large v).

Indeed, but Julian R. Abel told me that some recursive construction may be by itself sufficient to generate all (v,6,1)-BIBD with v>1000. Looks like when you have a lot of recursive construction you can do almost everything, and that some base cases will be the only missing things afterwards.

Ahahaah.

The point is that it is all a lot of work, and all an interesting work too. And I would like to add it someday, but for the moment I would like to finish implementing all the OA/TD/MOLS related code. I have some new constructions to add but I did not write the branch yet for it would depend on other tickets, and I am pretty sure that the main functions I need will be rewritten and changed during the reviews, so I don't dare write this yet as it will mean a lot of rebase.
