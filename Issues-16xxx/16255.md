Constructs a finite state machine with final output words for all states by implicitly reading trailing letters until a final state is reached.
    
This is e.g. useful for finite state machines operating on digit expansions: there, it is sometimes required to read a sufficient number of trailing zeros (at the most significant positions) in order to reach a final state and to flush all carries. In this case, this method constructs an essentially equivalent finite state machine in the sense that it not longer requires adding sufficiently many trailing zeros. However, it is the responsibility of the user to make sure that if adding trailing zeros to the input anyway, the output is equivalent.
