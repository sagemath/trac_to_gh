In order to illustrate the use of the version of `Transducer.cartesian_product` introduced in #16016 combined with the common transducers introduced in #16142, I added an additional example to the docstring of `Transducer.cartesian_product`. It computes the number of 11 blocks minus the number of 10 blocks over the alphabet [0, 1].
