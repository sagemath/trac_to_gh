The explorative algorithm for composition of finite state machines only
handles deterministic machines. We now raise a `NotImplementedError` instead
of simply taking a more or less random transition.
    
This is a similar stop-gap measure as #16539.
    
Once #16538 is implemented, non-deterministic machines shall also be implemented
in the explorative composition, cf. #16548.
