This ticket was automatically created by executing `git trac create -h`. I was expecting to get some more help on the `-b` flag for the `create` command, as indicated in the [manual](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/git_trac.html#create-a-ticket). Is this a bug or is my setup not working?
Should this be reported to the **git-trac-command** project?

The same command appears in the help section of [this pdf](https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command/blob/master/doc/git-cheat-sheet.pdf?raw=true) cheat-sheet ([TeX source](https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command/blob/master/doc/git-cheat-sheet.tex#L329)).
