The ticket provides a non-stub implementation for Hecke triangle groups.

The matrix elements are over Z[lam], an order in the number field Q[lam],
given by the minimal polynomial of lam=2*cos(pi/n).
A corresponding default embedding into AA(2*cos(pi/n)) is selected for lam.

Also see Ticket #16976 which depends on this ticket and has several
enhancements / improvements.
