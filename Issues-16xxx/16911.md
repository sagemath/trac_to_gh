This ticket is for

1. updating sagenb. Corresponding upstream ticket is https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/218
2. updating documentation inside sage to reflect the new development model for sagenb

```
cd SAGE_ROOT/upstream
wget -c 'https://googledrive.com/host/0B2kYdLdBVFHIZEd4ekpjNUFBNTQ/sagenb-0.10.8.3.tar'
git checkout -b develop ticket/16911
git trac pull 16911
../sage -i sagenb
../sage -b
```

---

To @vbraun: When merging this ticket, merge both this and #16396 since sagenb upstream has changes to fix doctests in that ticket, and that ticket in turn depends on an updated sagenb so that it can pass all doctests.  Also close #11469 as that is incorporated here.

Depends on #16396

Updated to new version with the upstream sagenb changes made to sphinx. The method to check it out is in description.

**Note**: this is not the final version of the sagenb package, since I haven't changed the Changelog, and it doesn't contain the changes from upstream ticket https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/218

Still, I am setting it to needs review so that the package itself can be tested against #16396

Sigh... and I had actually checked if it wasn't in the description!

It compiles and passes all doctests. I haven't yet looked at what it gives with #16396, but for this ticket, it's a positive review.

Hmmmm... I hadn't used the notebook since long, but I just failed to get a plot! Is there something wrong with:

```
from pylab import *

ys=sin(xs)
plot(xs,ys)
show()

?
