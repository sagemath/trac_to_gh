This ticket is for

1. updating sagenb. Corresponding upstream ticket is https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/218
2. updating documentation inside sage to reflect the new development model for sagenb

```
cd SAGE_ROOT/upstream
wget -c 'https://googledrive.com/host/0B2kYdLdBVFHIZEd4ekpjNUFBNTQ/sagenb-0.10.8.3.tar'
git checkout -b develop ticket/16911
git trac pull 16911

To `@`vbraun: When merging this ticket, merge both this and #16396 since sagenb upstream has changes to fix doctests in that ticket, and that ticket in turn depends on an updated sagenb so that it can pass all doctests.  Also close #11469 as that is incorporated here.

Updated to new version with the upstream sagenb changes made to sphinx. The method to check it out is in description.

**Note**: this is not the final version of the sagenb package, since I haven't changed the Changelog, and it doesn't contain the changes from upstream ticket https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/218

How can this ticket be fixed without the following?

To `@`vbraun: When merging this ticket, merge both this and #16396 since sagenb upstream has changes to fix doctests in that ticket, and that ticket in turn depends on an updated sagenb so that it can pass all doctests. Also close #11469 as that is incorporated here.

Looks like we will indeed be releasing a new one, so if you have an easy fix for this, I would appreciate that - you can communicate at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues or here or at #17292 or in private communication.

I dunno, I'm not convinced now.  I just repackaged a new one (it's not 100% ready, but just to test) and got

```
$ du sagenb-0.11.1.tar 
35824	sagenb-0.11.1.tar
$ du upstream/sagenb-0.10.8.2.tar
