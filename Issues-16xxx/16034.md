It would be useful if elliptic curves over number fields remembered known points of infinite order when extending the base field:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,0,1,-1751,-31352])
sage: K.<d>=QuadraticField(5)
sage: E.gens()
[(52 : 111 : 1)]
sage: EK = E.base_extend(K)
sage: EK.gens()
[]
```
These remembered points can be used by `EK.gens()`, and more generally `EK.simon_two_descent()`, via the `help` parameter of Simon's function `bnfellrank()`.

This commit does the following:
- new attribute `EllipticCurve_number_field._known_points` to store points coming from 2-descent
- make `EllipticCurve_number_field.base_extend()` transfer these known points to the base-extended curve
- make `EllipticCurve_number_field.simon_two_descent()` (and `gens()`, `rank_bounds()`) use `_known_points` as the optional argument `help` to Simon's function `bnfellrank`, and store any new points that were found
- make `EllipticCurve_rational_field.gens()` store its result in `_known_points`, and restructure this method a bit (by splitting of `_compute_gens()`) so this only has to be done at a single point
- a bit of general cleaning up
It's not really elegant, but my attempts at making it better were not very successful.

First of all : I am impressed with your speed of work. Very good ! I am glad someone really cares about these bugs and helps us improve sage that much. Thanks.

I had a look at the ticket and I am fine with all changes. I will do some tests now. Unfortunately I get a problem (probably not linked to this ticket) when building the doc, so I can't just yet review it. But hopefully I can do so soon.

[May I ask you if you would have time to look at #15737 ?]
