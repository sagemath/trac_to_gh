Hi Frédéric,

The description should mention that this ticket also refactors all the code doc for better conformance to the coding standards; thanks by the way! I checked those changes and they seem ok. While you are at it you might want to:

- Fix the couple remaining "Returns ..."
- `characteristic_quasisymmetric_function`: put a proper title for the doc
- line 1465: remove the `returns the`

As for the algorithm itself: this sounds reasonable, but I haven't checked the details. Also I haven't convinced myself it's uniform.

My patchbot should finish its work on this ticket and report shortly.

And by the way, could you put in the documentation of `random_element` that your sampler is uniform. At some point, I would like to implement some automatic testing for random samplers.

I have added in the doc that it should be uniform random

I have added in the ticket description that this is also a clean-up ticket

I have made a little more clean-up

I am not sure what to do with all the "`Returns ****.`" Should I remove all the `s` and all the final dots ? Is there really unanimity on this matter ?

I have not yet looked at `characteristic_quasisymmetric_function`

The developpers manual is rather specific about this. I believe the consensus is that this does not deserve wreaking havoc by changing it all other the source code; but when one is already changing a line or file heavily for conformance, one might as well go for it.

Thanks!
