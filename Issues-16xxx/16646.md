I had the pleasure to remark that to generate **ordered set partitions of size 42** one has to use Word... and for some obscure reason... 

```
sage: type(Word(Permutations(range(3,52)).first()))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.InfiniteWord_iter_with_caching'>
sage: type(Word(range(3,52)))
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
```
from a permutation of size 42 (>39), the word associated is an infinite word... 

(NOTE: This ticket fix `set_partition_ordered` not `Words`!!) 

Keywords: partition
