There was a TODO in the Dyck words file, about a conversion to triangulations of regular polygons. This provides the required method `to_triangulation`.

It also implements a fast `random_element` method for Dyck words. The existing one is *rather slow*.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Hi Frédéric,

`to_triangulation`:

- Here is a cool picture
  {{{
  sage: t = DyckWords(10).random_element().to_triangulation()
  sage: p = [(i,i+1) for i in xrange(11)] + [(11,0)]
  sage: g = Graph(12)
  sage: g.add_edges(p)
  sage: g.add_edges(t)
  sage: g.plot(layout='circular', edge_colors={'red':t, 'blue':p}).show()
  }}}
  (not necessarily needed to use it in the doc... I just like it!)

- I do not think that there is a need to have a line break after each sentence in the OUTPUT block

- The only place where you give a hint about the bijection is "In the implemented bijection, the set of smallest vertices of the edges in a triangulation is an encoding of the Dyck word." And I was not able to understand it... could you please refined it? Would it makes sense to have the reverse bijection somewhere?

`random_element`:

- please remove the trailing whitespace at line 3880 (in the doc of `random_element`).

- small improvement: you can replace `self(w)` by `self.element_class(self, w)` which avoids some typechecking and a copy.

- you can add a more appropriate test like
  {{{
  sage: D = DyckWords(8)
  sage: D.random_element() in D
  True
  }}}

<a id='comment:10'></a>Hello,

I did myself many changes that you can find on my branch u/vdelecroix/16394. I describe them below.

`to_triangulation`:

- The bijection is really cool but your implementation a bit dirty. There is no need to have do `i = l.index(coheight)` as you pop only on the right... i.e. you always have `i == coheight`. So I removed `i` and it works the same ;-)

- There is already a function `from_height` to build Dyck words for the set of heights
  {{{
  sage: DyckWords().from_heights([0,1,2,3,2,3,2,1,0])
  [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  }}}
  I thought it might be used to give the inverse bijections but these are height when you read the word as a path above the horizontal. Do you know how to write a one-line inverse bijection? Maybe using either `from_area_sequence` or `from_non_decreasing_parking_function`?

- I rephrase a bit the description emphasizing at the beginning that it is a bijection (not every map from Dyck words to triangulations is a bijection).

Everything is perfect in `random_element`.

So, please double check my modif in the code. After that, either you have an idea for the inverse bijection and you can add it to the documentation or you can set this to positive review after my commit.
