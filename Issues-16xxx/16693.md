In #16677 we added a documentation for the attribute `is_initial` of the class `FSMState` in the file `sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py` and added some doctests there. Those are not tested at all, which shouldn't be. 
MOreover, doctests which are in end_doc, as for example in `sage/combinat/dyck_word.py` are also  not tested.

Keywords: **doctests not tested**
