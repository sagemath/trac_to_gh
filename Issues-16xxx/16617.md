The iteration over subspaces over a given vector space takes infinite time (mainly because of complicated constructor in classes). We create an external "echelon_matrix_iterator" to be used for faster iteration...

More than incredible:

```
sage: from sage.matrix.echelon_matrix import echelon_matrix_iterator
sage: timeit("for m in echelon_matrix_iterator(GF(3),3,5): pass")
125 loops, best of 3: 3.01 ms per loop
sage: timeit("for _ in VectorSpace(GF(3),5).subspaces(3): pass")
5 loops, best of 3: 346 ms per loop
```
And there even a "faster" mode which avoids copy

```
sage: timeit("for m in echelon_matrix_iterator(GF(3),3,5,copy=False): pass")
625 loops, best of 3: 392 µs per loop
```

Helloooooooooooo !

First of all, I don't get why you wrote this in Cython instead of changing the old implementation... Does it change much to the performance ? I wonder if you wouldn't obtain the same crazy speedups simply caching `m0` as you do and using itertools instead of `VectorSpace`.. Or is it that you want to aviod the final matrix multiplication ?

Details:

- It seems that what you do is iterate on *reduced* echelon form

- `number of columnes`

- Could you add a doctest like that ?

```
sage: q=71
sage: F = GF(q)
sage: len(list(echelon_matrix_iterator(F, 1, 3, copy=False))) == q**2+q+1
True
sage: len(list(echelon_matrix_iterator(F, 2, 3, copy=False))) == q**2+q+1
True
```

- I do not understand why you have to call `del` `O_o`

Nathann

The main speed up is to get rid of VectorSpaces. I do not want to use them, so I need a `echelon_matrix_iterator`. Whether it is cython or not is a matter of micro seconds, so I do not care that much (except that using cython allows to set the cache of matrices with the pivot that can be used later).

Of course.

This is a crazy thing in the implementation of itertools. If the only reference to the tuple is owned by the iterator then it is reused. Otherwise you create a fresh one. What you gain is creation time of a tuple...

```
sage: from itertools import product
sage: timeit("for p in product([0,1,2,3],[3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]): pass")
625 loops, best of 3: 21.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit("for p in product([0,1,2,3],[3,4,5,6],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]): del p")
625 loops, best of 3: 7.81 µs per loop
```

I wondered if it was worth creating a file or if it was better to just change the code right where it was.

where it was the code was written to output vector spaces and I do not want to deal with them. So it was the only way to go. What I want to avoid is to create a vector space for each output (this is where most of the time is spent).

Seems that the code is not uniform among the matrices... for some implementation the code of `.echelon_form` starts with

```
def echelon_form(self):
    if self.fetch('in_echelon_form'): return self
```
but it seems to be not the case for matrices over finite field.

> Also, shouldn't the function be "reduced" echelon too ?


done.
