```
When one tries to apply a "right_rotate" (resp. "left_rotate") method on a binary tree which does not have a left (resp. right) subtree, one gets an "Index Error".


```
sage: bt = BinaryTree([])
sage: bt.right_rotate()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This does not look like a neat error... The rotation is not defined in this case, so I'm not sure what the behavior should be:

1- return the same object

2- return `None` (seems like a bad idea)

3- raise a `ValueError` exception that says the rotation is not defined in this case

I would be up for 1 or 2 and I'm not sure which one is best, please tell me what you think!

<a id='comment:1'></a>I'd suggest 2; why do you consider it a bad idea? I don't like throwing exceptions when the user is not at fault. I think 1 is too confusing.

Good catch; the two methods will be considerably more useful if they return reasonable data when the rotation cannot be performed.

Maybe we should have a look on other combinatorial objects to see how this question is handled.

By the way, I didn't catch this error, FindStat did ;)

I think the first (return the same object) and the second (return None) solutions are not good ways. 

To me, the method should raise an Exception: why not "NoRotationAvailable"? 
Or an (ugly) other solution the method `*_rotate` could be an iterator?

The tree

```

is mapped to

```
    x
   / \
  A   y

for nodes x and y and trees A,B,C. Now suppose that x doesn't exist and that A,B are empty. Then both pictures become

 y

This tree can thus be though of being fixed by the map.

Indeed, then the map would loose to be injective.

An alternative option would be to extend the domain and the codomain to all of the binary trees such that the map keeps being injective (and then a bijection on binary trees, not only a map from those having a left child bijectively onto those having a right child). To achieve this, one could possibly reflect the tree horizontally.

What do you think about that?

findstat can only handle maps that are defined for all elements of a combinatorial collection and this makes sense -- but this should not be a topic here (whatever you guys gonna decide, we will have to look for a, possibly different, solution for findstat).

Nevertheless, there should be a description of the rotation map on other Catalan objects (through a bijection to binary trees), and a natural extension there should lead to an extension of the rotation map. Does such a description exist?

<a id='comment:16'></a>Rotation on binary trees is an **elementary transformation** that should be coherent with the definition (the original one!!)

So that transformation is a partial map:
- that return a new (different) binary tree
- or that is not defined! -> raise an exception

If you are not agree with exception, the method could be an iterator. (My opinion (again) is that way is a wrong but I don't have any real argument...)

<a id='comment:17'></a>Let me summarize here:

- raising an exception is consistent mathematically but breaks everything unexpectedly. Let  say you have a big set of objects on which you want to apply the rotation, you can't do it easily without checking every single element. Also, the try catch might be slow.

- returning None does not break everything right away but it might lead to errors later that might be difficult to understand.

- doing nothing is also problematic because you then don't know if your tree has been changed or not.

- the iterator for something that returns at most one element seems somehow a bad idea (and is definitely not natural for a non advanced user)

I would really like to know if there are other combinatorial objects that have something like that and how it's dealt with. One possible solution proposed by Darij would be to have a default behavior and some kind of optional argument so that people can make it do what they want.
