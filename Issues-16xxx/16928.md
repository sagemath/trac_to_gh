We currently distribute (as `gap_packages` spkg) a small subset of all available [GAP packages](http://gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html).

As discussed in this [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/SfjNegnYMWA/MQ1MR_nRVnYJ), we should provide as
may as possible.
 
This ticket will monitor the progress towards this goal.
