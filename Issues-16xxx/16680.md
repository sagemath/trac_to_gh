```
The following doctest in `ell_finite_field.py` can fail (by returning a cached result) because the same curve is used in an earlier doctest and may be cached by the `UniqueFactory` from #11474:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(GF(10007),[1,2,3,4,5]).cardinality(algorithm='foobar')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Algorithm is not known
```
A trivial solution is to use a different curve for this test.

This ticket also makes the handling of the `algorithm` parameter more consistent and polishes the documentation a bit.

If all the algorithms are correct, then I see no reason why we should ever recompute the order once it has been computed in any way; it is only useful for debugging purposes.

I don't have a strong opinion on this, although using ``@`cached_method` would have the advantage that we can get rid of manual caching.

Fixed this, also polished the documentation a bit more and made `heuristic` an obsolete synonym for `pari`.  (`heuristic` just defaulted to `pari`, so there isn't any real heuristic going on, and "heuristic" may also be misinterpreted as saying that the result is not guaranteed to be correct.)
