```
The following doctest in `ell_finite_field.py` can fail (by returning a cached result) because the same curve is used in an earlier doctest and may be cached by the `UniqueFactory` from #11474:

```
sage: EllipticCurve(GF(10007),[1,2,3,4,5]).cardinality(algorithm='foobar')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Algorithm is not known
```
A trivial solution is to use a different curve for this test.

This ticket also makes the handling of the `algorithm` parameter more consistent and polishes the documentation a bit.

Depends on #11474

Well, we can't get rid of the manual cache because of the `cardinality_*` methods which set it when called (IMO, these should be private methods and have everything go through `cardinality()` but I don't have a stake in this).

I've changed it so that `algorithm` is always ignored if the cardinality is known. If someone wants to check against another algorithm, they can explicitly call one of the `cardinality_*` methods (which always do the computation).

Fixed this, also polished the documentation a bit more and made `heuristic` an obsolete synonym for `pari`.  (`heuristic` just defaulted to `pari`, so there isn't any real heuristic going on, and "heuristic" may also be misinterpreted as saying that the result is not guaranteed to be correct.)
