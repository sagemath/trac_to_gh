This usually doesn't surface since pretty much everybody has patch installed already, but:
* patch requires bzip2
* bzip2 requires pkgconf
* pkgconf uses patch to apply a patch (currently this dependency is not known to the Sage build system in `build/deps`)

Patch gzip tarball: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch/patch-2.7.1.tar.gz
