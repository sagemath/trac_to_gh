This usually doesn't surface since pretty much everybody has patch installed already, but:
* patch requires bzip2
* bzip2 requires pkgconf
* pkgconf uses patch to apply a patch (currently this dependency is not known to the Sage build system in `build/deps`)

The solution seems to be to distribute patch as gzipped tarball (not: bzip2) and remove this dependency, and add the dependency of pkgconf on patch instead.

What's the reason for upgrading `patch`? Have you tested this well on the buildbots? I remember lots of portability trouble with `patch-2.6.x`, that's the reason why we never upgraded before.

The changes to `build/deps` look good to me.
