This usually doesn't surface since pretty much everybody has patch installed already, but:
* patch requires bzip2
* bzip2 requires pkgconf
* pkgconf uses patch to apply a patch (currently this dependency is not known to the Sage build system in `build/deps`)

The solution seems to be to distribute patch as gzipped tarball (not: bzip2) and remove this dependency, and add the dependency of pkgconf on patch instead.

What's the reason for upgrading `patch`? Have you tested this well on the buildbots? I remember lots of portability trouble with `patch-2.6.x`, that's the reason why we never upgraded before.

The changes to `build/deps` look good to me.

I haven't tried, but I will anyway when merging the ticket. It seems a bit redundant to do it twice.

Since we don't have a solaris buildbot any more its probably fine. I upgraded patch since I think there will be problem with the build system if tarballs only differ by extension, haven't tried to find out exactly what might break though.
