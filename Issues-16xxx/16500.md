<a id='comment:10'></a>Yo !

I updated the "find" functions a bit. Nothing smart, just common sense, and the `MOLS_table` function is fast again. Yeepeeeeeeeeee !!! `:-P`

Ahahahah. I had nothing else `:-P`

I tried to reverse-engineer the construction from the theorem's claim, and when I was not able too I asked Julian R. Abel for a hint. This being said, the explanations I give in the docstring are more or less like a proof.

Because this function returns both OA and !True/False answers. The `find_*` functions I cached only return immutable stuff.

Ok. Will see that later. I postponed to #16535 if you agree.

But why not having `orthogonal_array` implements the three lines that are right now in `find_recursive_construction`? My main concern is about readability. I would prefer

```
@cached_method
def find_recursive_construction(k,n):
    for find_c in [find_construction_3_3,
                   find_construction_3_4,
                   find_construction_3_5,
                   find_construction_3_6]:
        res = find_c(k,n)
        if res: return res
```
That way:
- you still have the freedom to update `find_recursive_construction` without touching `orthogonal_array`
- you keep an eye on who did what with the cache
- you perform the work of adapting your answer only in `orthogonal_array`
- if you changed your mind about the syntax `existence=True` and such you will not have to touch to `find_recursive_construction`
- the file `orthogonal_array_recursive.py` will look like a "dynamical" database in the very same way that `database.py` is a static one

I will have to rebase what is currently above this patch, then.

Well.... does not matter...

Oh, you mean only the part that actually creates the design ? Yeah, why not !...

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hi,

small commit at `u/vdelecroix/16500`

Be careful that a truncated OA is **not** an incomplete OA. In truncated OA you removed points in columns whereas in incomplete OA you have less blocks than an OA (but columns are not changed)... it is very confusing to read your doc. And moreover you use block or column indifferently but it would be better to have a unique name for that.

In the doc of the construction 3.4 there is

```
- If there exists an `OA(k,m+r+1)` the column of size `s` is truncated in
  order to intersect `B_0`.

- If there exists an `OA(k,m+r+1)`, the last column must not intersect `B_0`
```
which is contradictory!

The rest is fine except that there is no need to use linear programming to build an oval, see #16552.

Looks good !

> Be careful that a truncated OA is **not** an incomplete OA. 


Arg yes yes, I always mix the two words `^^;`

And moreover you use block or column indifferently but it would be better to have a unique name for that.

Do you mean "column or group" ? There are `n^2` blocks in an `OA(k,n)` but `k` columns.

I don't se how `O_o`

Do you already did the even more general construction from Brouwer-Rees 1982 (they consider generalization of truncated OA where the extra columns are partitioned in possibly more than two parts)?

Yep yep. That's what I will remember of design theory. Deadly scary stuff that becomes totally straightforward once you pay attention to it.

Still, a lot of stuff remains deadly scary in the field `:-P`

> Do you already did the even more general construction from Brouwer-Rees 1982 (they consider generalization of truncated OA where the extra columns are partitioned in possibly more than two parts)?


Now yet, but I will have to. What scares me is not the implementation of the construction, but how to properly write the input part of the function `T_T`

When you implement Sage stuff you are forced to spend time on things you would quickly look at otherwise.
