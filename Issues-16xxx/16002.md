When you say upgrading, you mean from sage 5.13? Then yes definitely. Or was this upgraded in place numerous times?
It looks to me like there is cruft in your install:

```
/home/darij/gitsage/sage-5.13.beta1/local/include/ft2build.h
```
is not in this location in my sage install but in the freetype2 sub-folder. If you one in the this sub folder consider removing the one in local/include and try again.

You have both "local/include/ft2build.h" and "local/include/freetype2/ft2build.h". The first one shouldn't be there and is probably old cruft. I want you to remove it and retry to install matplotlib 1.3.1.

freetype changed it's header files recently breaking many downstream packages. For example, the patch to gimp [is here](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/patch/?id=6c73f28b6d87a2afd11974552a075bffec52347f) and shows clearly what changed.
