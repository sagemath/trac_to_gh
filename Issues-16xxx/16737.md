70% of long doctesting concerns four complex plots in `bessel.py`. Setting `plot_points=10` will probably not affect doctest quality but would be much faster. Even if done with image output there seems no difference in quality of the produced images.

This ticket applies all cleanup changes of #16023 and #16173 that are in `bessel.py`, as well as setting `plot_points=10`. It results in a reduction of long doctesting time by 80%.

Keywords: **special, speed**

Do you still need `long time` in this case?  Also, perhaps a `#` comment about how we speed it up with fewer `plot_points` would help readers unfamiliar with that function.

By the way, I find that the different regions differentiate themselves better with `plot_points=20`...
