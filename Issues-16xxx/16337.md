In the following example, the last line is incorrect:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     @cached_method(key=lambda self,y: y+1)
....:     def f(self, y):
....:         return y - 1
sage: class Bar:
....:     f = Foo.f

sage: b = Bar()
sage: b.f(0)
-1
sage: b.f.cache
{((0,), ()): -1}
```

It appears that I forgot to propagate the `key` parameter in some places while working on #15657.
