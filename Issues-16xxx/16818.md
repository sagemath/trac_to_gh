sage -i kash3 works, but gives

  rm: cannot remove `kash': No such file or directory

after installing. This happens on Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS, Sage version 6.3. Maybe just "3" forgotten on directory name?

This is due to `rm kash` after `cd "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/"`. It is unneeded, as `f` in next command `ln -sf kash3 kash` means that existing destination will be removed.
