The Bessel functions weren't removed that long ago, and note that there is a LOT more to be removed - namely, the whole underscore versions of them, see https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/functions/bessel.py?id=9db8c5c598ec9de953a33b14e531bee3c092c199#n1102 - basically to the end of the document.

Ah, #16737... sorry, I was looking at #16023 where it was originally proposed to remove these guys.  My apologies, 

I have to say it is annoying to have two different things all in that one ticket though.  Since you merged this branch into that one, I am going to prefer to review these changes here and those changes there.  It's not that huge of a patch, but it's still better to separate such development into little chunks, at least for my (slow) workflow.

And now you upgraded #16737 to 6.4.beta0 which I haven't built yet ;-) so it will take a little longer for that one.
