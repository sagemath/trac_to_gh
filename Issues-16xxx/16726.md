The computation of the binomial coefficient of a RIF or CIF (choosing an integer) gives an error: 

```
sage: binomial(CIF(1),2)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
TypeError: Either m or x-m must be an integer
```

This worked well in a previous Sage version (it was 5.13 or later).

The second argument `2` is converted into a CIF when `Function_binomial._evalf_` is called.
Therefore, it is no longer recognized as an integer in `sage.rings.arith.binomial`.

Actually, `sage.rings.arith.binomial(CIF(1), 2)` yields `0`, as expected.

<a id='comment:6'>Comment 6:</a>
The following is probably related:

```
sage: R.<n> = ZZ[]
sage: binomial(n, 3).parent()
Symbolic Ring
```

is annoying; however,

```
sage: R.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^QQ', QQ)
sage: binomial(n, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Asymptotic Ring <n^QQ> over Rational Field to Symbolic Ring
```
throws an error because aysmptotic rings intentionally do not coerce into the symbolic ring.

It turns out that this is unrelated; in fact, the problem described in this ticket has been fixed at some stage.

I added a doctest.

> ```
> sage: R.<n> = ZZ[]
> sage: binomial(n, 3).parent()
> Symbolic Ring
> ```

In fact, this works for polynomials over the rationals, so this is not a real issue.
