Given a projective point it fails to coerce to a subscheme point if it is created via `__call__`. It works for X.point().

```
sage : P.<x,y,z>= ProjectiveSpace (ZZ ,2)
sage : X=P. subscheme (x^2-y^2);
sage : X(P([4,4,1]))
```

Looking in generic/scheme.py, it seems that X.point() should be called with `args[0]` instead of `args` similarly to what is done for Elliptic Curve points.

Here is a fix; it also slightly simplifies the `Scheme.__call__()` method.

Thanks for fixing this. You got to it before I had the chance, so I've reviewed it.

Fix looks good and passes all tests.
