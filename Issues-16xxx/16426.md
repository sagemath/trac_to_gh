This [seems to be implemented](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/lie/weyl_character_ring.html#frobenius-schur-indicator) in sage-combinat for their uses, but [GAP 3](http://www.gap-system.org/Gap3/Manual3/C050S007.htm) at least has it in general (I couldn't find a reference online for Gap 4, though it is in Sage).

**Status:** new
