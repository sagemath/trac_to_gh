```
For G a graph, G.adjacency_matrix() calls G.density() to decide whether
to use a dense or sparse matrix. G.density() raises a TypeError if G is a
multigraph. This is silly.

To witness the problem, try:
sage: G = Graph([(i,i+1) for i in range(500)]+[(0,1),], multiedges=True)
sage: G.adjacency_matrix()

The revised code tries density and, if that raises a TypeError, defaults
to a dense matrix. (So, if someone extends density, this code
automatically improves.)

Sure -- if you think that's better.  My reason for doing it this way:  if someone later improves density() to work for multigraphs, adjacency_matrix will then automatically use the improved code. (I imagine someone might improve density() but not think to look at adjacency_matrix.)  And trying density() probably doesn't take much time.

Do you still prefer to test if it's a multigraph, rather than catch the exception?  If so, I'm happy to change it.

It is not a problem of improving `.density()` : how do you define the density of a multigraph ?

Hi Nathann,

Fair enough!  On the other hand, the relevant notion here seems to be the density of the honest graph obtained by replacing each multiple edge with a single edge. I could change the code to compute that, and decide whether to return a dense or sparse matrix based on that computation. Or just have multi graphs always return a dense matrix, like the code does now. Do you have a preference?

I agree, but this is too expensive. And this is equivalent to building a sparse matrix, computing the number of non-null entries, and converting it to a dense matrix if it saves space.

Returning a dense matrix in all cases makes sense to me.

Why this double if/else ? All you have to do is replace

```
if n <= 256 or self.density() > 0.05:
```

with that

```
if n <= 256 or self.has_multiple_edges() or self.density() > 0.05:
```

You can also write that if you prefer :

```
if (n <= 256 or 
    self.has_multiple_edges() or
    self.density() > 0.05):
```
