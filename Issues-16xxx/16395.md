```
For G a graph, G.adjacency_matrix() calls G.density() to decide whether
to use a dense or sparse matrix. G.density() raises a TypeError if G is a
multigraph. This is silly.

To witness the problem, try:
sage: G = Graph([(i,i+1) for i in range(500)]+[(0,1),], multiedges=True)
sage: G.adjacency_matrix()

The revised code tries density and, if that raises a TypeError, defaults
to a dense matrix. (So, if someone extends density, this code
automatically improves.)

Sure -- if you think that's better.  My reason for doing it this way:  if someone later improves density() to work for multigraphs, adjacency_matrix will then automatically use the improved code. (I imagine someone might improve density() but not think to look at adjacency_matrix.)  And trying density() probably doesn't take much time.

Do you still prefer to test if it's a multigraph, rather than catch the exception?  If so, I'm happy to change it.

I agree, but this is too expensive. And this is equivalent to building a sparse matrix, computing the number of non-null entries, and converting it to a dense matrix if it saves space.

Returning a dense matrix in all cases makes sense to me.
