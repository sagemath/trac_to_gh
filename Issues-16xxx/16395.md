```
For G a graph, G.adjacency_matrix() calls G.density() to decide whether
to use a dense or sparse matrix. G.density() raises a TypeError if G is a
multigraph. This is silly.

To witness the problem, try:
sage: G = Graph([(i,i+1) for i in range(500)]+[(0,1),], multiedges=True)
sage: G.adjacency_matrix()

The revised code tries density and, if that raises a TypeError, defaults
to a dense matrix. (So, if someone extends density, this code
automatically improves.)

Sure -- if you think that's better.  My reason for doing it this way:  if someone later improves density() to work for multigraphs, adjacency_matrix will then automatically use the improved code. (I imagine someone might improve density() but not think to look at adjacency_matrix.)  And trying density() probably doesn't take much time.

Do you still prefer to test if it's a multigraph, rather than catch the exception?  If so, I'm happy to change it.

Hi Nathann,

Fair enough!  On the other hand, the relevant notion here seems to be the density of the honest graph obtained by replacing each multiple edge with a single edge. I could change the code to compute that, and decide whether to return a dense or sparse matrix based on that computation. Or just have multi graphs always return a dense matrix, like the code does now. Do you have a preference?

I agree, but this is too expensive. And this is equivalent to building a sparse matrix, computing the number of non-null entries, and converting it to a dense matrix if it saves space.

Returning a dense matrix in all cases makes sense to me.

Why this double if/else ? All you have to do is replace

```
if n <= 256 or self.density() > 0.05:
```

with that

```
if n <= 256 or self.has_multiple_edges() or self.density() > 0.05:
```

You can also write that if you prefer :

```
if (n <= 256 or 
    self.has_multiple_edges() or
    self.density() > 0.05):
```
