I installed `sage -i dot2tex` and then I get an error saying that `dot2tex not available`:

```
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_edge(3333, 88, 'my_label')
sage: G.set_latex_options(format='dot2tex')
sage: view(G)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: dot2tex not available.
```

The reason is that the function `assert_have_dot2tex` replaces the `ImportError` (in my case a pyparsing importerror) by a `RuntimeError` with the `dot2tex not available` message. This hides the real error.

BEFORE fix:

```
sage: from sage.graphs.dot2tex_utils import assert_have_dot2tex
sage: assert_have_dot2tex()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFTER fix:

```
sage: from sage.graphs.dot2tex_utils import assert_have_dot2tex
sage: assert_have_dot2tex()

An error occured when importing dot2tex.

The patch fixes a problem. The problem is that an exception is catched and replaced by a message error which is misleading. The solution is simply to reraise the error if an error occurs. If no error occurs, then more tests are done as before.

> Why do you remove the whole file ?

The patch does not remove any file. What do you mean?

> If you only want to intercept a specific import error, why don't you do something like that instead ?

Because an `"ImportError"` is already enough. I do not need to be more specific.

I want to keep the message. This is the purpose of this ticket. Changing the error message just hide the real problem.

> I don't get it again : why do you both print a message THEN raise the exception ? 

Because it was like that before and because that printed message is unrelated to the purpose of the ticket. I kept the message because it just gives more information.

BEFORE:
- print error info about dot2tex    (unrelated to the goal of the ticket)
- then raise `RunTimeError` with error info about dot2tex  (related to the actual ticket)

NOW:
- print error info about dot2tex
- then reraise the error

Ok maybe print statement is not clean I agree. Do you want me to fix that part in this ticket? But how should it be then? How to add cleanly info before raising an exception?

What I understand is that formerly ths try/except contained too much, while with your patch it only contains the import statement.

Sooooooooo there is no risk that catching this ImportError and raising another importerror with a more useful information (i.e. how to install the spkg) would hide anything, is there ?

> Because it was like that before and because that printed message is unrelated to the purpose of the ticket. I kept the message because it just gives more information.

The message is useful indeed, but you print it before raising an exception.

I still do not understand. What could possibly go wrong with that :

```
try:
    import dot2tex
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError(the_more_meaningful_message_that_you_currently_print)
```

Suppose `import dot2tex` raises an `ImportError` which is caused by the importation of another module like `pyparsing` (see the description of the ticket). Then the more meaningful message that you can think of will be confusing because it will not give you the error traceback for the pyparsing import error.

(by the way, I don't think you need the "as e" part), you could do

You are right.

I forgot to remove it after I tried to add info in e unsuccessfully:

Swallowing the traceback is good if you can give a better diagnosis. But I'd avoid randomly changing the error message as it'll be actually harmful if you do a web search for it.

In any case, this ticket is closed.
