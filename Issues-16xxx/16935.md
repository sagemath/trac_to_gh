<div id="comment:0"></div>

I've written a faster algorithm to get the set of all the distinct palindromic factors of a given word. There's also a new function called long_lpc (for long method to get the longest palindome centered at a given position) that is added.

You can see here that the algorithm is factor, especially for long words.

Here is the old version :

```
sage: f=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['a']}).fixed_point('a')[:1000]
sage: %time M=f.palindromes()
CPU times: user 1.83 s, sys: 22.8 ms, total: 1.85 s
Wall time: 1.83 s

sage: t=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['b','a']}).fixed_point('a')[:1000]
sage: %time N=t.palindromes()
CPU times: user 1.02 s, sys: 8.4 ms, total: 1.03 s
Wall time: 1.02 s

sage: tm=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['b','a']}).fixed_point('a')[:5000]
sage: %time N=tm.palindromes()
CPU times: user 28.5 s, sys: 117 ms, total: 28.7 s
Wall time: 28.6 s
```

And the new version :

```
sage: f=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['a']}).fixed_point('a')[:1000]
sage: %time M=f.palindromes()
CPU times: user 436 ms, sys: 20 ms, total: 456 ms
Wall time: 450 ms

sage: t=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['b','a']}).fixed_point('a')[:1000]
sage: %time N=t.palindromes()
CPU times: user 362 ms, sys: 19.7 ms, total: 382 ms
Wall time: 371 ms

sage: tm=WordMorphism({'a':['a','b'], 'b':['b','a']}).fixed_point('a')[:5000]                  
sage: %time N=tm.palindromes()
CPU times: user 2.94 s, sys: 45.3 ms, total: 2.99 s
Wall time: 2.96 s

```


The principle of the algorithm is to calculate, for every letter and every space between two letters, the longest palindrome centered in that position. Once a longer palindrome is found, the information leftwise to the center is copied to the right because the proper subpalindromes are present at least twice.

At the same time, there is a list created recording the length of the longest palindromic suffix of each prefix of the word. Since the number of prefixes is bounded by one plus the length of the word, the set of palindromes to be compared is not too big (the comparison is necessary to get the unicity).

There is still a problem with the palindromes() function already in SAGE that has not been fixed with the new algorithm : For `f`-palindromes (or pseudo-palindromes), the word morphism `f` cannot apply to words generated with the WordGenerator class on the default alphabet (0,1). The main problem is that the type of the letters of these words are `int` (not words, nor any type that can be changed into words). I did not find any way to fix it, except to change the alphabet when generating these words.

```
sage: fib=words.FibonacciWord()[:1000]
sage: type(fib)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_iter_with_caching'>

sage: type(fib[5])
<type 'int'>

sage: type(words.KolakoskiWord()[2])
<type 'int'>

sage: type(words.ThueMorseWord()[2])
<type 'int'>
```

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

I did a first quick reading of the code. Here are some comments about it. I still need to actually read the code itself, which I will do in another comment not today.

1. There are two failing doctests in `finite_word.py`. Also, some tabulation were introduced in that file. According to the [Python code style](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style), the convention is to use 4 spaces for indentation levels.

```

2. The name of the method `long_lpc` is not communicative. I would suggest to use `length_longest_palindrome` instead.

3. There are missing commas in input docstrings:

```diff
-        - ``j`` -- integer a position that is the symmetry axis of the palindrome.  
+        - ``j`` -- integer, position that is the symmetry axis of the palindrome.  
-        - ``m`` -- integer (default: 0) the minimal length of the palindrome, if known.
+        - ``m`` -- integer (default: 0), minimal length of the palindrome, if known.
```

4. Missing spaces in the argument of a function:

```diff
-            sage: Word('01010').long_lpc(j=3,f='0->1,1->0')
+            sage: Word('01010').long_lpc(j=3, f='0->1,1->0')
```

5. [White spaces](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements) are wrong here:

```python
#Initialize m if set to 0
if m==0:                 
    m=-(j%2)             
```

and many other places.

6. Why? No space was OK.

```diff
-        INPUT:  
+        INPUT : 
```

7. Why do you erase and modify doctests in the `palindromes` method?

8. There is *a lot* of comments in the code. Are all of them really necessary? I have never seen Sage code with that many comments. If the algorithm is really complicated, the code can be simplified by moving parts into another method. Also, the pseudo code of it can be put in the doctrings. But, I would leave the code with less comments. See also : http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments

It is difficult for me to take a look at the code itself when the syntax convention are not followed.

1. One empty line is nice to separate block of code. Two consecutive empty lines should be avoided.

2. Never put an empty line after a `for` statement.

3. Try to keep comment on one line. Rephrase if necessary.

4. One line should be less than 80 characters.

5. If a comment takes more than one line, then avoid any indentation for the second line.

6. A comment should always start at the actual indentation level.

7. Why do you write `k = Integer(0) ` instead of just `k=0`?

8. `long_lpc` should not appear anymore (code + doctest).

9. Slices of words should not be changed into tuple to make the equality test. The code in that class is mathematical. It should not play with the internal representation. Suppose your word is already represented by a tuple. Why change it into a tuple?

10. Remove useless comment like 

```
# Return the length of the palindrome
return p
```

11. Add comments where it is necessary:

```
except IndexError:
    pass          
```

Why such an error is not an error? It seems strange to me to choose such an implementation...

12. The code of `length_longest_palindrome` method contains the same line four times:

```
while j//2 - i >= 0 and tuple(self[j//2-i : j//2-i+1]) == tuple(f(self[j//2+i : j//2+i+1])):
    i = i + 1
```

13. Anyhow, in the line of code above, avoid the creation of a tuple. Also, I suggest to avoid the slice and simply use a for loop for the indexes you want to compare.

I am thinking of a code that would look like that (it is most probably wrong as I did not think about the limit cases and even vs odd palindrome length, etc.)

```
possible = max(j, self.length()-j)
i = m / 2
while i < possible and self[j-i] == self[j+i]:
    i += 1
return i
```

But you get what I mean: short and clean code do not need any comment.

    Also, the palindromes method should have a `algorithm` argument allowing to choose between the old and new way of doing things. This facilitates the comparison of efficiency. Otherwise, it is more difficult to see how faster is your new algorithm.

16. Be more brief. For instance replace the 7 lines

```
# The list LPS records the lengths of the longest
# `f`-palindromic suffix for each prefix of self.
LPS = [] 
 
# The list LPC records the lengths of the maximal
# `f`-palindromes centered at each position j in self.
LPC = []     
```

by the 2 lines:

```
LPS = [] #lengths of longest palindrome suffix of prefixes
LPC = [] #lengths of maximal palindromes centered at a position
```

and so on...

Indeed, I can see that it is currently twice as fast:

> I did not find any way to fix it, except to change the alphabet when generating these words.

I am not sure I understand the problem. But, if `w` is a word of length 1 in sage, then `w[0]` will give the the letter it contains. Using this, you can compare the equality of letters after the application of the function `f`.

I am very happy with the way the code is now separated. Most of the methods are written clearly. I am still not convinced by the  optimality and clarity of the `length_maximal_palindrome` method. I started a new branch where I changed the way the indices are worked out. [My branch is here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/ef438b50865857394a404adf56b3c6218997419a). Tell me what you think.

I added a raise Value Error when the parity of m is the same as the parity of 2j which is an impossible case. I was surprise to realize that it breaks the other methods:

```
sage: Word('01101001').lengths_maximal_palindromes() 
...
ValueError: j-(m+1)/2(=5/2) must be an integer, i.e., 2*j(=6) and m(=0) can't have the same parity
```

This means that the impossible case is in fact used. Do you understand why?

Finally, I think the palindrome method can now be written as a one liner using a list comprehension...

I don't know why, but I used a very complicated way to assing a value for `m` in the second case of `lengths_maximal_palindromes`. I changed it so it is easier to see what it does, and it does not use the impossible case.

> Finally, I think the palindrome method can now be written as a one liner using a list comprehension...

I changed it. Tell me what you think.

Great. I think we are almost done now. I just looked at the code. Here are some more fixes to do. Tomorrow (or the day after) after you do the below changes, I will review everything again (doctests, documentation building fine, etc).

1. The call to Integer is not necessary in the first method (sorry my bad):

```diff
-   return Integer(jj - 2*i - 1)
+  return jj - 2*i - 1
```

2. (bis) There should be an empty line after OUTPUT. The reason is that without the empty line, the documentation will not build correctly. You may try to check how it looks on a method of an object by doing this (I do not known if this still works) :

```
sage: m = matrix(2, range(4))
sage: browse_sage_doc(m.inverse)
```

3. spaces:

```diff
-                if LPC[k]+k-j != LPC[2*k - j]:
+                if LPC[k] + k - j != LPC[2*k - j]:
```

4. remove empty lines:

```diff
-
-        k = 0
-
+        k = 0
```

5. The creation of the list is not necessary:

```diff
-        return set([self[i-LPS[i] : i] for i in range(len(self)+1)])
+        return set(self[i-LPS[i] : i] for i in range(len(self)+1))
```

Excellent. Since we are dealing with possible float in entry (like 2.5) and since `w[i]` needs `i` to be an integer, I think that we have to keep the following two lines (do the doctests pass for you without them?) :

```
 jj = Integer(jj)
```

```
 i = Integer(i)
```
