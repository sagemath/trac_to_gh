From #11631:

  the name "cuspform_lseries" is bad, since f is already a cuspform, and we use the name "lseries" in all other places (e.g., elliptic curves, abelian varieties), so it is hard to find. In fact, I didn't even think to look for cuspform_lseries, instead only finding this via lots of grepping and reading source code.

The same applies to "modform_lseries".

The goal of this ticket is to add a method lseries() to modular forms which creates the L-function in both cases, and to deprecate the old two.

I have added a method `lseries()` to modular forms which creates the L-function in both cases (cuspidal forms and eisenstein series), and deprecated the old two.
    
Part of this is unifying both methods which had very similar code but were staring to diverge.
