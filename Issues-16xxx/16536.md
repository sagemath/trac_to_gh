```
In Py2 the standard function [sorted()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted) and the mutable list method [sort()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types) both have an optional parameter `cmp=` that takes a custom comparison function of two arguments.

The parameter is no more available in Py3. 

The recommended way is to use the `key=` which specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element. This has also better performance.

While there is a function [functools.cmp_to_key()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key) to convert an old-style cmp function to a key function, it is preferable to directly use an appropriate key function.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

Attachment [exercise-cmp-key-parameters.py](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket16536/exercise-cmp-key-parameters.py) by @wluebbe created at 2014-06-27 14:46:13

The workings of `functools.cmp_to_key` is nicely explained in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16362744/how-does-pythons-cmp-to-key-function-work).

This is also demonstrated in the attached script.

It is also shown that it is not a good idea the use "cmp=" and "key=" together even in Py2!
