It is, in principle, easy to check if poset A contains a subposet isomorphic to poset B:

```
def has_isomorphic_subposet(A, B):
    for x in Subsets(A.list()):
        if A.subposet(x).is_isomorphic(B):
            return True
    return False
```

In reality this is way too slow. Can this be made usefully fast at least in posets of size 5..10?

Seems that this function is easy:

```
def has_isomorphic_subposet(A, B):
    if A.hasse_diagram().transitive_closure().subgraph_search(B.hasse_diagram().transitive_closure(),induced=True) is None:

    return True
```

(Thanks to Nathann Cohen for this.) Needs to test this, and then just add few lines of code + documentation to Sage.

That's a bug. There is no reason why computing the transitive closure of a graph requires that graph to be mutable (indeed, the graph itself is not modified: its closure is returned as a completely new graph).

You can fix it by going into `src/graph/generic_graph.py`, and in function `transitive_closure` replace `copy(self)` with `self.copy(immutable=False)`.

Hello !!

> 1) Should I open a new ticket about `transitive_closure`? And if so, mark it as a dependency to this one? I have no idea about what to check on `DiGraph` class; hence, if I made a fix and you review it, it will actually be work of only one person. If I have understood correctly, idea is to have always two people looking at code.

I would fix it in the same ticket given that it's a very small change, but then that's up to you if you do not feel safe fixing this yourself. It is a fairly simple change, needed because we only recently added a support for immutable graphs (graphs that cannot be modified) and so a lot of code written before is not made to handle it. It is exactly the case here, where you have to say explicitly that the copy should NOT be immutable, even if the graph itself was immutable.

If you prefer to leave others double-check it, then indeed you should open another ticket which would be a dependency of this one (only if you need that bug to be fixed in order to implement what you write here).

> 2) About dokumentation: I already made an example on N5 containing 4-element diamond lattice. Would this be enought for documentation: "Return True if the poset contains a subposet isomorphic to other. By subposet we mean a poset containing elements with partial order induced by that of self."?

"Induced" here seems a little too vague to me. But you could complete it with the code you used before:

"By subposet we mean tha set <code>\`\`X\`\`</code> of vertices such that `P1.subposet(X).is_isomorphic(P2)`.

I really think that it would be best to implement both features at once (possibly with an optional 'induced' boolean parameter in the function you add). And it would also be nice to give the user a way to obtain the copy of P2 in P1, as they will probably want this as a certificate.

Whatever you do, the beginning of the doc of each function should be a one-line description of what it does. Then you can describe better the behaviour of the function.

1) As this is not urgent change, I made another ticket (16909). Of course I could also do this without another one, adding note like "After transitive_closure() is fixed, change..."

2) Yes, that is actually better phrasing.

Can 'induced' be later added with default value to `True`?

One more question: What is the meaning of having same documentation and examples copied to both posets.py and hasse_diagram.py? For example has_bottom() and actually most of functions?

I believe that `False` (i.e. the transitive closure version) should be the default behaviour, I think that it is the most common definition of 'subposet'.

Why exacty do you want to add a method to HasseDiagram, given that they are digraphs and that they already inherit the `subgraph_search` method which does exactly the same (and even a bit more as it returns the graph) ?

It does work "on the paper", but by doing this you first build the whole list of copies, then return it. And it could take a long time, in particular if the user is only looking for some specific copy. By replacing the [] with (), you turn it into a Python interator, and the list is not totally built first but only when the users wants to read more and more values.

Example:

```
sage: e=[x for x in NN if is_prime(x)] # will never stop
```

But

```
sage: e=(x for x in NN if is_prime(x))
sage: for p in e:
....:     print p
....:     if p>10:
....:         break
....:

Could it be because there are multiple ways to send D into N5 ?

True. But you can build a set from an iterator if you like, while if the function returns a lot of objects you are forced to store them all whatever you use case is.

I believe that it is criminal in this case to build the whole list before returning anything. To me, if you believe that this is uncompatible with the name of the function, I think that the function's name should be changed, and not the other way around.

If you try to find a chain of length 20 in a chain of length 40, the code just won't run.

I committed a version where `hasse_diagram.py` is not modified at all.

Is every possible object that can be an element of a poset comparable? If so, maybe is there some way to remove duplicates by order: Remove subset 0,2,1 and let 0,1,2 be? But this must be think more.

If it is not possible, should there be function giving also duplicates, with warning section saying something about that?

Hello !

No, you cannot assume that. The points of a poset may be sets themselves, and their order with respect to `<=` is not a total order.

> If it is not possible, should there be function giving also duplicates, with warning section saying something about that?

This is the way it is done in `Graph.subgraph_search_iterator`.

Hello !

A few other remarks:

- Could you only import `uniq` where you need it and not in the module's head ?

- The first line of doc in `isomorphic_subposets_iterator` is still right after the `"""`

- The one-line descriptions that you added to the index at the top of the file are not correct (as far as I can tell, english is not my language):

"Return an iterator over the subposets isomorphic to other poset" -> to another poset ? Or 'to a given poset' ?

- Could you add an 'INPUT' section to your functions ?

Thanks,

Nathann
