Hello Christian,

thanks for your time. I think it is ready for review. I have kept only the simplest tests about rank 2, marking the longer ones with `# not tested`. I think these functions were used to check thoroughly that there was no mistake in the code. One should keep them in the code to be able to run them if some mistake appears at some point, but it does not look necessary to run them every time.

I have also taken this opportunity to do some little code formatting, like 
* lines of length at most 80
* pep8 standard for code (no space after or before parenthesis, etc)
* removed a lot of unused import statements (found with pyflakes)
* comment out 2 unused variables

I think that these `_random_multi_tests` are not worth doing a single time. Even doing them 100 times, it is unlikely to trigger a bug in the code (when working on that certainly tooo complicated functions, I had to do those tests 10000s of times to find possible issues). So I would still tag them as `{# not tested` since those 1.5sec of testing for practically no advantage doesn't seem to be worth spending on doctesting.
