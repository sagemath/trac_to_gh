Currently, there's a problem with toric divisors of toric varieties created from fans that live in a sublattice.

The following examples illustrates that:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: S = N.submodule([(1,0,0), (0, 1, 0)])
sage: B = S.basis()
sage: cones = [Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])]
sage: f = Fan(cones)
sage: X = ToricVariety(f)
sage: X.is_complete()
True
sage: (-X.K()).polyhedron()
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices and 1 line
```
However, the real polyhedron should be a two-dimensional compact polygon:

```
sage: (-toric_varieties.P(2).K()).polyhedron()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
```

thanks for having a look at this. You're of course right.
I've changed the code and am now using a doctest that would give an incorrect result for the previous patch.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Unfortunately, the diff on trac seems to be broken. Something else has come up and I'm not sure what to do about it.

Consider the following:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(4)
sage: S = N.submodule([(1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0)])
sage: B = S.basis()
sage: S.dual()
2-d lattice, quotient of 4-d lattice M by Sublattice <M(0, 0, 1, 0), M(0, 0, 0, 1)>
sage: S.dual().gens()
(M[0, 1, 0, 0], M[1, 0, 0, 0])
sage: S.gens()
(N(1, 0, 0, 0), N(0, 1, 0, 0))
```
Usually, we have that `i`th generator of a lattice is 'dual' (don't know whether that's the right adjective) to the `i`th generator of the dual lattice. Here, however, there is an additional reordering going on.

As a consequence, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: cones = [Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -3*B[0]-2*B[1]]), Cone([-3*B[0]-2*B[1], B[0]])]
sage: X = ToricVariety(Fan(cones))
sage: p = (-X.K()).polyhedron(); p
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
sage: p.integral_points()
((-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (0, -1), (0, 0), (1, -1))
sage: (-X.K()).sections()
(M[-1, -1, 0, 0],
 M[0, -1, 0, 0],
 M[1, -1, 0, 0],
 M[2, -1, 0, 0],
 M[-1, 0, 0, 0],
 M[0, 0, 0, 0],
 M[-1, 1, 0, 0])
```
which leads directly to this (obviously incorrect, see the `z1^-3`) output:

```
sage: (-X.K()).sections_monomials()
(z1^6, z0*z1^3, z0^2, z0^3/z1^3, z1^4*z2, z0*z1*z2, z1^2*z2^2)
```

What should be changed? Finding the generators of a dual of a lattice? The polyhedron method of the divisor? The monomial method of the divisor?
