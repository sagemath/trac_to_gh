Currently, there's a problem with toric divisors of toric varieties created from fans that live in a sublattice.

The following examples illustrates that:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(3)
sage: S = N.submodule([(1,0,0), (0, 1, 0)])
sage: B = S.basis()
sage: cones = [Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -B[0]-B[1]]), Cone([-B[0]-B[1], B[0]])]
sage: f = Fan(cones)
sage: X = ToricVariety(f)
sage: X.is_complete()
True
sage: (-X.K()).polyhedron()
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices and 1 line
```
However, the real polyhedron should be a two-dimensional compact polygon:

```
sage: (-toric_varieties.P(2).K()).polyhedron()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
```

Alright, here's a short patch that fixes the problem. I don't know whether it's the best way of working around this, but it's simple and does the trick.

Volker, could you have a look? :)

Hi Andrey,

thanks for having a look at this. You're of course right.
I've changed the code and am now using a doctest that would give an incorrect result for the previous patch.

I think this polyhedron should live in the `fan.dual_lattice()`, so instead of lifting the generators and taking the intersection with their span (which is something pretty random), the correct approach is to push previously used inequalities into this dual lattice (which is a quotient, so has smaller dimension).

<div id="comment:12" align="right">Comment 12</div>

Unfortunately, the diff on trac seems to be broken. Something else has come up and I'm not sure what to do about it.

Consider the following:

```
sage: N = ToricLattice(4)
sage: S = N.submodule([(1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0)])
sage: B = S.basis()
sage: S.dual()
2-d lattice, quotient of 4-d lattice M by Sublattice <M(0, 0, 1, 0), M(0, 0, 0, 1)>
sage: S.dual().gens()
(M[0, 1, 0, 0], M[1, 0, 0, 0])
sage: S.gens()
(N(1, 0, 0, 0), N(0, 1, 0, 0))
```
Usually, we have that `i`th generator of a lattice is 'dual' (don't know whether that's the right adjective) to the `i`th generator of the dual lattice. Here, however, there is an additional reordering going on.

As a consequence, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: cones = [Cone([B[0], B[1]]), Cone([B[1], -3*B[0]-2*B[1]]), Cone([-3*B[0]-2*B[1], B[0]])]
sage: X = ToricVariety(Fan(cones))
sage: p = (-X.K()).polyhedron(); p
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
sage: p.integral_points()
((-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (0, -1), (0, 0), (1, -1))
sage: (-X.K()).sections()
(M[-1, -1, 0, 0],
 M[0, -1, 0, 0],
 M[1, -1, 0, 0],
 M[2, -1, 0, 0],
 M[-1, 0, 0, 0],
 M[0, 0, 0, 0],
 M[-1, 1, 0, 0])
```
which leads directly to this (obviously incorrect, see the `z1^-3`) output:

```
sage: (-X.K()).sections_monomials()
(z1^6, z0*z1^3, z0^2, z0^3/z1^3, z1^4*z2, z0*z1*z2, z1^2*z2^2)
```

What should be changed? Finding the generators of a dual of a lattice? The polyhedron method of the divisor? The monomial method of the divisor?
