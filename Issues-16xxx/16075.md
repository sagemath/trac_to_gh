To advance some iterator `it` in Py2 often the iterator method is called directly `it.next()`.
But since Python 2.6 there is the //builtin function// `next()` which is compatible between Py2 and Py3: in Py2 it calls the iterator method `next()` while in Py3 it calls the special method `__next__()`.

This conversion from `it.next()` to `next(it)` can be performed safely in stage 1 (see also the remarks about `lib2to3.fixes.fix_next` in http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html#stage-1-safe-fixes).

Remarks: The changes to the iterator protocol from Py2 `next()` to Py3 `__next__()` are subject of #18802 in stage 2.

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.

Keywords: python3
