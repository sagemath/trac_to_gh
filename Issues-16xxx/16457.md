In python3 xrange() was renamed to range().

With this patch iterators will become lists till we switch to python 3. But this should be okay for small intervals. (That's the reason for not changing all.)

This is part of #16081.

NOTE: xrange can (and should) stay inside the code of .pyx files

<a id='comment:2'></a>I am strongly against that this ticket is being merge now. We are far from having the Python 3 switch tomorrow (is it even a blocker for sage-6.3?). It will slow down everything. `xrange` is faster by 40% on lists of size 100:

```
sage: timeit("for i in xrange(100):\n for j in xrange(100): pass")
625 loops, best of 3: 362 µs per loop
sage: timeit("for i in range(100):\n for j in range(100): pass")
625 loops, best of 3: 501 µs per loop
```
And there are many of them in Sage source code.
