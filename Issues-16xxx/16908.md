Could you justify this change?

```diff
- sage: latex(integrate(1/(1+sqrt(x)),x,0,1))
- \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + 1}\,{d x}
```

I think the purpose of this test is to show an integral that Maxima cannot compute. You could replace this by a different integral...

Do I understand correctly that you propose to always use `...` and only keep the minimum among the various numbers of digits that are output by all existing versions of Sage?

Could you explain more precisely why you object to showing the output of the doctests with the (increased) precision used by the current Sage version?  Does it cause more work for you to keep them updated, or do you expect it may cause confusion among users with different versions of Sage?

I refer to changeset `e216b6f` in comment [comment:27].

Yes it would be better to only keep the minimum number of digits output by all versions of Sage (since the one we use in our book, i.e., 5.9).

The intent of those doctests is to only to check the examples that were **printed** in the book still work in versions of Sage after 5.9. Thus it makes no sense to add more digits than those that were actually printed on http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/. Any doctests with a different intent should go elsewhere in my opinion.

OK, but surely a doctest where the only change is an increased precision should be classified as "still working"?  In any case, a user who types the doctest in a newer version of Sage will also see the extra digits.
> Thus it makes no sense to add more digits than those that were actually printed on http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/. Any doctests with a different intent should go elsewhere in my opinion.

I don't disagree, but given that the doctests need to be updated in any case, I don't understand why adding the extra digits is bad and adding `...` is better.  Feel free to open a ticket for it, though!
