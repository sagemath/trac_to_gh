Previously, `FiniteStateMachine.product_FiniteStateMachine` and `Transducer.cartesian_product` were products of two finite state machines `self` and `other`, i.e., a product of two machines.

We now allow `other` to be a list of machines such that products of several machines can now be computed.

That would have been possible before by successive products, but the outcome would have been nested pairs, which would then have required some post-processing.

As a use case, think about looking for occurrences of several blocks (using `transducers.CountSubblockOccurrences`) simultaneously.
