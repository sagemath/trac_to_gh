For some sums of exponential functions with complex arguments, `simplify_rational()` takes very long or is caught in an infinite loop (it did not finish in 40 minutes).

```
 (e^(8/5*I*pi) + e^(4/5*I*pi)).simplify_rational()
```


Keywords: simplify symbolics exponentials

This is no longer the case because Pynac automatically expands many trigonometric expressions with rational multiples of `pi`, before the expression is handed to Maxima.

```
