Elliptic curves over the rationals have mathods ``has_cm()`` and ``cm_discriminant()``.  We extend these to curves over number fields, and add a function ``has_rational_cm()`` to indicate the the curve has CM which is defined over its base field (i.e. the CM discriminant is a square in that field), which is always False over QQ.

Done.  This probably counts as rewriting history, too bad.  #16743 will depend on this anyway.

I've seen Complex Multiplication to mean over the base field and to mean over the algebraic closure, so "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has Complex Multiplication." is ambiguous. It could be "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has Complex Multiplication over the algebraic closure." or "Returns True iff this elliptic curve has a CM j-invariant." as in the number field case.

At some point a better implementation of the basic function (detecting whether an algebraic integer is a CM j-invariant) would be good, but the one there is fine for small degrees which is likely to be all that is needed most of the time.

<a id='comment:25'></a>What's the intention of the code

```
try:
    D = self._CMD
    if D:
        return D
    else:
        raise ValueError("%s does not have CM"%self)
except:

which is obviously equivalent to

```
try:

    if D:

I assume you meant something like

```
try:

    pass
else:
    if D:
        return D
    else:

Apart from this issue, you really should never use `except:` since that catches also `KeyboardInterrupt`.

You are right. Could you reopen this ticket? This should not be merged into a stable version without fixing that code.

<a id='comment:28'></a>Apologies, of course I meant to write "except AttributeError".  I do know the rules.

To make absolutely sure:  the field _CMD stores 0 if it has already been determined that E does not have CM, and in this case the method cm_discriminant raises an error -- not my choice but for compatibility with curves over Q.  (I would have preferred to return 0 which is easy for other coed to check).

I'll be happy to review #17076 (though I seem to have forfeited my right to give any code a trustworthy review with this lapse).
