See also #16191.

Introduce `FSMState.final_word_out` in order to accomodate subsequential transducers in this package. A transducer is said to be subsequential if it is deterministic, every state
is final and it has a final output word for each final state, i.e., when reading an input and reaching some final state along some path, then the final output word of this state is appended to the output labels collected along the path.

This will facilitate various transducers, e.g., when we currently have to read a sufficiently large number of zeros in order to flush some more output.

Only final states can have a final output word.
