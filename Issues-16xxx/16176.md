This is now fixed and needs a doctest:

See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/qexNzA3iDzE).

```
n = var('n')
sum(log(1-1/n^2),n,2,oo)
```

The error is in Maxima's `simplify_sum`.

Gotta love distributed work.  Already [committed in upstream](http://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/727fe8276d410f04cc1f5503e2c873144b4d48df/tree/share/solve_rec/simplify_sum.mac?diff=3c32ce1f27c2990e2f77a3374b77f25df1390694).  (I haven't checked it works but anyway there is a commit in the right file.)

So this (eventually) needs a new Maxima package and a doctest.
