This is now fixed and needs a doctest:

See [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/qexNzA3iDzE).

```
n = var('n')
sum(log(1-1/n^2),n,2,oo)
```

The error is in Maxima's `simplify_sum`.

Depends on #9635

So this (eventually) needs a new Maxima package and a doctest.
