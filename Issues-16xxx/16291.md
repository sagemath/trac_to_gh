This ticket follows discussions in #16245, comments 4 and 5. This discussion raised a break of associativity in FormalCompositeMap.

Currently, the `FormalCompositeMap` only stores "first" and "second" map. Hence `(f*g)*h` builds a tree like:

```
|\
| \
|\ h 
f g
```
whereas  `f*(g*h)` builds a tree like:

```
|\
f \
  |\
  g h
```

As a result, map composition is not associative:

```python
sage: from sage.categories.map import Map
sage: f=Map(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: (f*f)*f==f*(f*f)
False
```

I think this class should contain a list of several Map. I've made a draft of it, the only doctest I had to change was those involving `FormalCompositeMap` string representation. Indeed, this representation was treelike and is now linear.

Is this still meant as a draft as stated in the ticket description?  I think it looks good in general, but maybe you could improve the formatting of the code and try to conform to the Python [style guide](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [docstring conventions](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

In particular:
- use consistent spacing (including spaces after punctuation marks and no spaces before them)
- do not put `if foo: bar` on a single line unless foo and bar are very short
- docstrings should start with a single line, or two if really necessary; four, as in `__getitem__()`, is definitely too many

Also, I recommend keeping the `first()` and `second()` methods, since they are public and existing user code may depend on them.

Sorry for being annoying, but I'm afraid you partially misunderstood my request about punctuation...  By punctuation marks I meant one of `. , ; : ? !`, not equality signs or operators.  (See the section "Whitespace in Expressions and Statements" on the first linked page in [comment:6](#comment:6).)

What is the reasoning behind `head()` and `tail()`?  If you think of morphisms as arrows, then composing two morphisms, say by putting `f` first and `g` second, gives

```
   f      g
* ---> * ---> *
```
In this picture it would be visually suggestive to call `g` the head and `f` the tail!  Why not keep `first()` as it is, implementing a method `last()` and making `second()` a deprecated alias for either `last()` or `__getitem__(1)`?

Actually, the moment when I read `head` and `tail`, I was reminded of `car` and `cdr`, so that had the desired effect. 8-)

Forget what I said about introducing `last`, I was confused.  (Well, we could introduce it anyway, but just as "the last morphism in the composition", not with the current meaning of `tail`.)
> We could keep *head* and *tail*, but reverse them to be consistent with arrow diagrams (who says *head* should be first in applicative order? We are making up the terminology, anyway). Or maybe *head* and *shaft*, this is even more figurative!

I think it sounds nice, but `shaft` might be a bit annoying for people who don't think of morphisms as arrows.  And I would expect `head` to be the *last* morphism in the composition, not the composition of all except the first.
> Or, if we want to stick with the applicative order, what about *first* and *then*?

I like this idea, because it is close to the existing terminology and because `then` is nicely consistent with the way composed morphisms are printed.
> Whatever we choose, I think we should take names that sound ridiculous enough to force the user to read the docstring, rather than say "I know what that means".

I don't know, at the same time they should preferably also be of the kind that you remember once you have seen them.  And they shouldn't be so ridiculous that they become distracting.

I'm starting to think that altogether `first` and `then` suggests itself as the preferred choice.
