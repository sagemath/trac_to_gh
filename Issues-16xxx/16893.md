```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1)
sage: ZF = F.ring_of_integers()
sage: A = matrix(ZF,[[1,0,0,0],[0,-1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]])
sage: B = identity_matrix(ZF,4)
sage: VA = (ZF^4).span(A)
sage: VB = (ZF^4).span(B)
sage: VB == VA
False
```
This should return true.  As Sage is only checking the echelon form, it is not catching this. 

To fix this I used the wrapped pseudo basis nfhnf and compute the Hermite normal form and the pseudo basis ideal list as _pseudo_hermite_matrix.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hi,

There are (trivial) rebase to do on top of `sage-6.7.beta2`.

Apart that, in your commit there are a lot of trailing whitespaces (i.e. space before end of line) and you should get rid of them.

I did not check much about the code yet but I am currently doing it. Would be cool to have this integrated into Sage.

Vincent

<a id='comment:4'></a>After a first lecture:

- `self` should not be mentioned in the `INPUT` section.

- in your example `[ideal(ZZ(p)) for p in ...]` you could remove the `ZZ`. The output of `prime_range` are already integers.

- `ValueError("gens and ideal_list must have the same lenghth")` chane `lenghth` into `length`

- it is better to use `ZZ is ZF` rather than `ZZ == ZF`. The reason is that it does not involve Python comparisons (which might be tedious). Similarly, you can safely replace `ideal_list == None` with `ideal_list is None`

- instead of `pari(F)` use `F._pari_()`. Doing that way you can remove `pari` from the imported modules. You can also go from `pari` to `sage` using `.sage()`

```
sage: m = matrix([[2,1],[1,1]])
sage: p = m._pari_()
sage: p
[2, 1; 1, 1]
sage: p.sage()
[2 1]
[1 1]
```
  copying the entries one by one will be rather slow (it will not necessarily works well with number field elements).

- you can replace `[F.ideal(1) for id in range(len(self.gens()))]` with `[F.ideal(1)] * len(self.gens())`.

```
  can be replaced with

```
return cmp(Ids, OIds) or cmp(Mat, Omat)
```
