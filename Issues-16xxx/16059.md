Playing with braid groups for a demo today, i want to see its Cayley graph in a neighbourhood of the neutral element:

```

ball = set()
ball.add(B.one())
for length in range(1,4):
    for w in Words(alphabet=B.gens(), length=length):
        ball.add(prod(w))
G = B.cayley_graph(elements=ball, generators=B.gens())
G.plot()

```

![](Cayley_before.png)

Hmmm, it looks locally like the free group, as if there was no relation !

`s0 * s2` is a different vertex as `s2 * s0`, while:

```
sage: s0 * s2 == s2 * s0
True
```

Indeed:

```
sage: hash(s0 * s2)
954209079
sage: hash(s2 * s0)
1883627875
```

There should be a canonical representation for elements in Braid groups. At least, two equal elements should have the same hash. Currently, `cayley_graph` answers something wrong !

After the modification, the Cayley group looks like:

Actually, there is already an indirect check when `G` answers `Digraph on 31 vertices` (to be compared to `Digraph on 40 vertices` for the free group, some vertices are merged). Is it enough ?

Otherwise, i do not know a short way to represent directed graphs in Sage, but i could add a test for the undirected version of the graph using `sparse6_string` representation along the following lines just after the previous example, though i am not sure it is easy to read:

```
sage: graph_string = ':^_`aa`ddd`aHhh_lmmmfLqqlStt_HjWxxvW{{'
sage: G.to_undirected().is_isomorphic(Graph(graph_string))
True
```

What do you think ?
