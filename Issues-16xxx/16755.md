Inputting rationals in MILP constraints or objective functions should work for the PPL interface (even though PPL doesn't seem to provide an interface for inputting rationals, we need some manual rescaling):

```
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver="PPL")
sage: x = p.new_variable(nonnegative=True)
sage: p.add_constraint(x[0] + x[1] <= 1/2)
sage: p.set_objective(x[0])
sage: p.solve()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
[...]
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```

Also fix a bug where the constant coefficient of the objective function is ignored.
