#16678 makes `SymmetricGroup(n).algebra(K)` return `SymmetricGroupAlgebra(K,n)`.

This is nice in principle since `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` makes use of the specific properties of the symmetric group to provide more features (better implementation of the center, Yucis-Murphy elements, ...). However `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` is not a drop-in replacement for the plain group algebra of the symmetric group. In particular it breaks several assumptions of `.algebra` like the fact that the basis of `G.algebra(K)` is indexed by elements of `G` (here the basis is indexed by plain `Permutation`'s); it is therefore likely to create bugs and confusion.

This ticket reverts `SymmetricGroup.algebra` to the default behavior. See #16926 for a proper plan to endow it with the additional structure of `SymmetricGroupAlgebra`.

I considered this. It means leaving an algebra method in SymmetricGroup that does nothing but the standard thing, except for having an extra chunk of doc advertising SymmetricGroupAlgebra and the backward incompatibility issue. I can do that if you think that's helpful for the user.

Right now, I am running all tests after just stripping away the method.

I'm not quite sure about the (unwritten as far I can tell) assumption that `G.algebra` has a basis indexed by the elements of the group.

Here are some timings of the two implementations:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: GA = GroupAlgebra(S, QQ)
sage: %timeit L = list(GA.basis())
10 loops, best of 3: 23.3 ms per loop
sage: %timeit SL = list(SGA.basis())
1000 loops, best of 3: 775 µs per loop

sage: L = list(GA.basis())
sage: SL = list(SGA.basis())
sage: %timeit sum(L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 357 µs per loop
sage: %timeit sum(SL)
1000 loops, best of 3: 336 µs per loop
sage: %timeit prod(L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 466 µs per loop
sage: %timeit prod(SL)
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.28 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sum(L)^2
100 loops, best of 3: 2.26 ms per loop
sage: %timeit sum(SL)^2
100 loops, best of 3: 7.68 ms per loop
```
So getting the basis is significantly slower using the generic code, but multiplying elements is faster using the group.

Also going from the permutation group elements to a permutation is fast:

```
sage: lst = list(S)
sage: %timeit Permutation(lst[4])
10000 loops, best of 3: 69 µs per loop
```
although there is a slight bug:

```
sage: P3 = Permutations(3)
sage: P3(lst[4])
TypeError: object of type 'sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup_element.PermutationGroupElement' has no len()
```
Multiplying permutation group elements is *really* fast compared to Sage's permutations:

```
sage: %timeit prod(lst)
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.27 µs per loop
sage: P3L = list(Permutations(3))
sage: %timeit prod(P3L)
1000 loops, best of 3: 446 µs per loop
```
So my proposal would be to change the indexing set of `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` to be the `SymmetricGroup` and add conversions to Sage's permutations where necessary.

Hi Travis,

Thanks for the timings!

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A11):
> I'm not quite sure about the (unwritten as far I can tell) assumption that `G.algebra` has a basis indexed by the elements of the group.

```
    sage: S = DihedralGroup(3)
    sage: S.algebra?
    ... provided by Sets.ParentMethods.algebra ...
    This returns the K-free module with basis indexed by S, endowed
    with whatever structure can be induced from that of S.
    ...
```

So any subclass overriding `algebra` should satisfy those premises.

> Here are some timings of the two implementations:
> ...
> So getting the basis is significantly slower using the generic code,

To be precise: in both cases, the implementation of ``basis`` is the
same (provided by ModulesWithBasis). What we are seeing here is that
iterating through `SymmetricGroup(n)` is slower than iteration through
`Permutations(n)`. Actually ridiculously slower:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(6)
sage: %time l = list(S)
CPU times: user 1.05 s, sys: 29.2 ms, total: 1.08 s
Wall time: 1.19 s
sage: S = Permutations(6)
sage: %time l = list(S)
CPU times: user 27.6 ms, sys: 13.4 ms, total: 41 ms
Wall time: 34.2 ms
```

In principle the complexity should be fairly similar, even for a
generic permutation group implementation; there really must be a
glitch in the GAP/Sage communication given that GAP itself is about as
fast as `Permutations`:

```
sage: S = gap("SymmetricGroup(6)")
sage: %time l = S.List()
CPU times: user 21.7 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 21.7 ms
Wall time: 33.9 ms
```

But we are deviating here. That's for a separate ticket.

> So my proposal would be to change the indexing set of `SymmetricGroupAlgebra` to be the `SymmetricGroup` and add conversions to Sage's permutations where necessary.

This would be even more backward incompatible: people have been using
`SymmetricGroupAlgebra` for a long while, and some may have a specific
need for having it indexed by plain permutations. I prefer the
approach outlined here and in #16926.

Cheers,
                                  Nicolas

I didn't interpret that as a contract, but just instead a statement about what the generic method returns. I think some more terse language is needed, such as adding "All classes overriding this method must return a K-module with basis indexed by S".

It's possible that GAP is also slow, and I get similar behavior when using the Weyl group. However this is definitely something for a separate ticket.

It's (relatively) easy to get Sage's `Permutation`s to compare equal to permutation group elements, as perm gp elts have a method called `_gap_list`, which returns the oneline notation and compares correctly to a `Permutation`. We would also need to change the hash for a (standard) `Permutation` to return a hash of the tuple of self (and we could do this generically by doing this first and if we need a fallback, use the hash of the string representation). This should allow the basis to take a `Permutation` and return the correct element (plus IMO they really should compare properly anyways).

At the end of the day, the biggest thing I don't like is having a generic implementation when there is a specialized implementation (which we agree on I believe). Reverting the change and having more classes (even with a good ABC) seems like a much harder maintenance task in the long run.
