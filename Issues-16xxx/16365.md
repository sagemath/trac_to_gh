The docstring for `ChainComplex.betti` says

```
  - ``base_ring`` -- a commutative ring (optional, default is the
          base ring for the chain complex); compute homology with
          these coefficients -- must be either the integers or a
          field
```
however, in fact if `base_ring` is `None` then under the hood it defaults to QQ.  Thus the `betti` method will choke on examples where `ChainComplex.homology` work fine:

```
sage: K = QuadraticField(-1, 'i')
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:matrix(K, [K.gen(),0])})
sage: C.homology()
{0: Vector space of dimension 1 over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1,
 1: Vector space of dimension 0 over Number Field in i with defining polynomial x^2 + 1}
sage: C.betti()
[...huge traceback...] 
TypeError: Unable to coerce i to a rational
```
and moreover gives **incorrect** answers when it silently coerces the chain complex into QQ:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:matrix(GF(5), [[3, 1],[1, 2]])})
sage: C.homology()
{0: Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 5,
 1: Vector space of dimension 1 over Finite Field of size 5}
sage: C.betti()
{0: 0, 1: 0}
```
I think the fix is just to change line 1344 of `homology/chain_complex.py`.  I will test this and upload a patch.
