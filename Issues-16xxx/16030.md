I agree with rws that it's not 100% clear why this is necessary, and I won't be looking for typos or syntax errors (though it mostly looks fine assuming `git trac` does the same thing as `sage -dev` in some sense), but did find one things that should be fixed even if one agrees with "the author".

```
This section gives an example how to review using the ``sage``
```
One of the times that shows up you actually have used `git trac` - toward the end of the diff.

Long comment addressed (presumably) to Volker, though of course anyone else who has been writing things like the `sage -dev` or `git trac` stuff is more than welcome to join in:

The overly dismissive tone about the `dev` scripts is unnecessary, and to be honest seems a little insulting to the people who worked hard on creating those - which doesn't include me, and t think might even include said author of the guide, which confuses me?  

In any case, relegating the dev script part to something that isn't really even mentioned seems... odd.  I think that "the author" has an overly optimistic view of how easy it is to overcome all the hurdles associated with development.  And yes, Virginia, some open source projects don't collaborate using git.  It would be helpful to have this discussion on sage-devel about this, rather than a somewhat combative tone in what is supposed to be an educational document providing the easiest path to doing things like reviewing a patch.

Fair enough, I suspected this.

It's not so much about further work, as making sure there is SOME low bar to entry.   I'm not worried about current developers; hardly any of them were using `hg_sage` toward the end either, but there are always people who need that level of entry.

If "git trac" ends up being very easy to use, that's fine; the current instructions on this ticket looked rather overwhelming, but perhaps reorganization of that section would change that impression?

With that in mind, before I open a discussion, I guess I'm curious what your roadmap actually is.

I agree of course that the bar of entry should be as low as possible. One thing that I could do is start with just "readonly" access where you get the sources and make changes. And then have a separate section talk about uploading those changes. What do you think about that?

About my roadmap, I've been developing the git trac script over the last 6 months and they form the core of my release management workflow. I've implemented pretty much everything that I think should go in there, so now its time to start steering people towards using them. This is part of the reason for being very frank about `sage -dev`, I don't want to dis anybody but I want to steer any newcomer in the right (or what I think is right ;-) direction.

Perhaps along these lines, here is something either wrong or confusing.

```
[user@localhost sage]$ git checkout master
[user@localhost sage]$ git branch last_twin_prime
[user@localhost]$ git branch
  master
* last_twin_prime
```
But it says "Also note that git branch creates a new branch, but does not switch to it. For this, you have to use git checkout:" - yet the star is on `last_twin_prime`.

I've just installed these scripts, so while novice impressions are fresh:
- I have cloned the original repository from trac following "Tentative conventions" wiki, so my "origin" in git already points to trac and seems a bit silly to add it as "trac" as well. In general, it would be nice to have some clear statement in the "setting up" of why there is a github version as well and when one should use it. Maybe there is already something somewhere, but I don't recall seeing it. I do recall someone (Volker?) saying that it saves bandwidth.
- There are way too many versions of installing "git trac" ;-) And "python setup.py install" has to be run as sudo, would be nice to add it to the documentation. I guess this is why there is also an option of just adding it to PATH.
- "Configuration" gives two commands for setting remote trac as read-only or read-write, and only one of the two has to be used, which is not immediately clear. And who has to use read-only anyway?
- Is it possible to have "parameter TAB completion"? I.e. when I type "git trac <TAB>" I'd like to see these "create", "push" etc. as it happens with regular git commands, but instead I get local file listing.
- Enabling "git help trac" would be nice as well!
- Perhaps password in the example can be entered in single quotes to avoid problems with special characters, i.e.

```
$ git trac config --user=Myself --pass='s3kr1t'
```
- And adding there an appropriate chmod would be nice since by default .git/config is 0644

```
$ chmod 0600 .git/config
```

Tab completion is a shell feature. I've addressed the other comments in my last commit.

Darn, I finally had removed enough from my plate to work on this today and tomorrow (I even opened my shell on the train, only to discover no wifi today, how annoying).

Yes, that is a very good catch - I'm still confused about it myself!

Okay, let me fix that and try to slightly rearrange this somewhat today.  My main ideas would be (none of which would take very long once I have an uninterrupted stretch)
* Make top of index.html a little more organized, showing coming attractions (for those reading it and not just searching in it)
* Rename "Collaborate Development" to "Collaborative Development with Git Trac" and make it its own (sub)section
* Probably making the "Writing Code for Sage" a main section, while putting all the git/trac related stuff into a separate main section
* Putting the notebook developer stuff at the end again (and possibly warning that some of the info may be outdated)
* Miscellaneous wording fixes.

> For a complete newbie approach it might be nice to have a `sage upgrade 12345` to just download the ticket branch and rebuild sage without any user intervention. We can do that in the followup.

Yes, that is true, but you are right it would definitely be outside the scope of this ticket - and I'm not sure I'd want "upgrade" as the word.

And it's IMHO a bit weird to assume someone would start *developing* Sage without (ever?) having it installed... 

Of course there are also binary dists, but at least the source code of the Sage library is always included, and I think most users will have taken a look at it before considering contributing, or will at least have seen it in tracebacks ;-) or by having typed `foo??`.

Still, there should probably be a special section or a whole chapter for "absolute beginners", starting e.g. with how to fix a typo in the documentation, i.e., where to find the relevant file(s), how to edit them, how to rebuild the docs (and also the Sage library, in case of docstrings), then introducing what revision control systems are all about, that Sage (now) uses `git`, and how Sage development is organized (trac -- not just a bugtracker, but used for *all* Sage development; "stable" releases vs. "development" releases, how reviewing happens, the relevant mailing lists...) -- and the latter mostly in prose, without terminal screen dumps, and without mentioning dozens of commands and options (whether with or without referencing other sections) in the first place.

(I don't mean this should be added *on this ticket*, and IMHO we should get what we have into Sage 6.2, since then presumably a lot more people will give feedback such that we can further improve it.)

Oh, I was referring to the [draft](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/vbraun/doc/developer/walk_through.html#obtaining-the-sage-source-code):

*"Obviously you need the Sage source code to develop, so we download it from github which is a public read-only mirror (=faster) of our internal git repository [...]"*

Or, how *I* read it:

*"Obviously **you** need the Sage source code to develop, so **we** download it from github [WTF?!] which is a public read-only mirror [Aha, so I previously installed the wrong version?] (=faster) [Ok.] of **our __internal__** [!?!?!] git repository [...]"*




Sorry for *my* words being misleading... :-/




P.S.:  A mirror is always "read-only".  (Otherwise it would be a proxy, or an instance of a distributed system.)

Hmmm, I'd somehow mention that by doing so he/she/we/one obtain(s) both the *latest stable* (aka "official") release [= `master` branch] as well as the current/latest *development* `__release__` [= `develop` branch, which corresponds to the latest beta/rc version]; each of those branches corresponds to its respective source tarball (he/she/we/one might have downloaded already before getting involved into Sage development, or before reading this).
