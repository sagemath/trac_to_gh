```
In Py2 there is the [exec statement](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#index-55), while in Py3 there is an [exec() function](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#exec).

The tool 2to3 changes the `exec` statement into the `exec()` function.


The tuple form of `exec` provides compatibility with Python 3, where `exec` is a function rather than a statement.

There are 6 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Keywords: python3
