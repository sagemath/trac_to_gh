}
```
In Py2 there is the [exec statement](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#index-55), while in Py3 there is an [exec() function](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#exec).

The tool 2to3 changes the `exec` statement into the `exec()` function.


The tuple form of `exec` provides compatibility with Python 3, where `exec` is a function rather than a statement.

There are 6 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Depends on #16712

Keywords: **python3**

See https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/simple_stmts.html#exec

    The first expression may also be a tuple of length 2 or 3. In this case, the optional parts must be omitted. The form `exec(expr, globals)` is equivalent to `exec expr in globals`, while the form `exec(expr, globals, locals)` is equivalent to `exec expr in globals, locals`. The tuple form of `exec` provides compatibility with Python 3, where `exec` is a function rather than a statement.
