There was when I left it for review!  Where can it have gone?  It was called u/cremona/ticket/16336 if I recall.  Also, I assume tha Jeroen actually used the branch I uploaded...

Maybe not.

I simply did

```
./sage -dev checkout --ticket 16336
```
which makes a new branch if the Trac ticket has no branch.
