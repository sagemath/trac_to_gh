Complex number *do* have these attributes, just not the minimalist `complex` Python data type.

```

a.__gt__            a.__rdiv__          a.__truediv__
```
And the built-in `math` module doesn't do `arcsec`

```
sage: math.a[tab]
math.acos   math.asin   math.atan   math.atanh  
math.acosh  math.asinh  math.atan2  
```
and even then only takes ones with real output

```
sage: math.acos(1)
0.0
sage: math.acos(2)
ValueError: math domain error
sage: math.acos(a)
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
```

Maybe.  Is `CDF` basically the same as `complex`?  Is there precedent for this?

I do not know a precedent, but we will not be losing anything from doing this. The Python `complex` number comprises of two floating point numbers which are implemented as `double` in C - see [this documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex). The `CDF` in Sage also use double precision floating point numbers.

```
sage: CDF.precision()

# Following the documentation at

You'll notice that [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/functions/trig.py#n562)

```
arctan = atan = Function_arctan()
```
so `atan` is exactly the same as `arctan` - one fix works for both!

I see what you mean now, you also mean `arctan`, `arccos`, and `arcsin`.  Sorry for my confusion.   I expect they are evaluated in Ginac.  I will investigate that a bit.  But at least those guys plot fine.

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nGot it!\n\nWhen `GinacFunction` goes up to `BuiltinFunction` it first tries doing it in `Function`.  That coerces your complex to SR.  (Incorrectly, perhaps, because \n\n```\nsage: SR(float(1))\n1.0\nsage: SR(complex(1,1))\n(1+1j)\n```\nand I'm not sure what's up with the parentheses, but I don't really know much about coercion in Sage.)\n\nAnyway, then it goes to the `arcsin()` *method* in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression (!) because now we have a symbolic expression for the previously `complex` input.  And I'm pretty sure that this is where things go wrong, because [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx#n1596) it looks like it tries to coerce our now-symbolic thing to `RR`, which of course we can't do.\n\nNow you'll notice that in e.g. `py_tan` in the same file it then would go on to try coercing to `CC`, but it doesn't here.  In fact, in a whole bunch of places this happens, and \n\n```\nsage: sinh(complex(1,1))\n<snip>\nTypeError: Unable to convert x (='(1+1j)') to real number.\n```\nso I am pretty sure this is where things end.\n\nThe reason your fix for the other arc trig functions works is because they are not defined in Ginac/Pynac.  But these functions don't work with complex input, presumably because [here](http://www.ginac.de/reference/inifcns__trans_8cpp_source.html#l00642) it doesn't handle complex stuff, or maybe because when we replaced Ginac's internal numbers with Sage ones something happened.  \n\nI'm cc:ing Burcin, who will probably have a suggestion as to the best place to fix this.  But my druthers would be to just copycat what happens in sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx for other complex input, like `py_exp` or `py_acosh`.\n\nThough as you say if we can't get it done quickly enough here, we can do this stuff and open a new ticket for it.  But I really don't like that coercion to SR of complexes.",

Got it!

When `GinacFunction` goes up to `BuiltinFunction` it first tries doing it in `Function`.  That coerces your complex to SR.  (Incorrectly, perhaps, because 

```
sage: SR(float(1))
1.0
sage: SR(complex(1,1))
(1+1j)
```
and I'm not sure what's up with the parentheses, but I don't really know much about coercion in Sage.)

Anyway, then it goes to the `arcsin()` *method* in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression (!) because now we have a symbolic expression for the previously `complex` input.  And I'm pretty sure that this is where things go wrong, because [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx#n1596) it looks like it tries to coerce our now-symbolic thing to `RR`, which of course we can't do.

Now you'll notice that in e.g. `py_tan` in the same file it then would go on to try coercing to `CC`, but it doesn't here.  In fact, in a whole bunch of places this happens, and 

```
sage: sinh(complex(1,1))
<snip>
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='(1+1j)') to real number.
```
so I am pretty sure this is where things end.

The reason your fix for the other arc trig functions works is because they are not defined in Ginac/Pynac.  But these functions don't work with complex input, presumably because [here](http://www.ginac.de/reference/inifcns__trans_8cpp_source.html#l00642) it doesn't handle complex stuff, or maybe because when we replaced Ginac's internal numbers with Sage ones something happened.  

I'm cc:ing Burcin, who will probably have a suggestion as to the best place to fix this.  But my druthers would be to just copycat what happens in sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx for other complex input, like `py_exp` or `py_acosh`.

Though as you say if we can't get it done quickly enough here, we can do this stuff and open a new ticket for it.  But I really don't like that coercion to SR of complexes.

Just one point - almost certainly some of those digits are 'extra' from Python.  Compare (after this):

```
sage: sec(1.+i)
0.498337030555187 + 0.591083841721045*I
sage: sec(complex(1,1))
(0.49833703055518686+0.5910838417210451j)
sage: sec(CDF(complex(1,1)))
0.498337030555 + 0.591083841721*I
```
Interesting.

Here is something else I don't know what to do with.

```
sage: arccot(1.+i)
arccot(1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*I)  # in SR
sage: cot(1.+i)
0.217621561854403 - 0.868014142895925*I
```
One would think this should be the same type of output.

That said, `SR` is useful for some other cases of exact input.

I'm wondering whether we want to try to fix all of this here, though.
