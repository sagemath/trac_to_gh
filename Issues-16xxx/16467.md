An error occurs when in a fully hidden Doubly-Linked List an element is unhidden. All elements that come after it will also be unhidden.

```
sage: l = sage.combinat.misc.DoublyLinkedList(xrange(5))
sage: l.hide(0)
sage: l.hide(1)
sage: l.hide(2)
sage: l.hide(3)

Doubly linked list of xrange(5): [1, 2, 3, 4]

This proposal is a revamp of the internal storage, to become an actual doubly linked list, in which elements that have not been defined at initialization can also be inserted and removed. A side effect that occurs, but that in my opinion should not be a problem, is that the order of the elements may change upon removal and re-insertion now.

I do not see this as a problem, as the Doubly Linked List abstract data type has no concept of maintenance of order.

This poses a useful question:
- Should an object be able to be in the list multiple times?

If so, the data storage plan used now will not work, and a structure using actual Node objects should be used. However, this will either break compatibility, as remove() now takes the object to remove, while then it would require the node containing the object, or it will increase the complexity of remove() from O(1) to O(n) by searching for the node to be removed. Both cases seem highly undesirable to me.

If objects cannot be represented multiple times, this can quite easily be fixed by creating some sort of 'has' dictionary, checking whether an element is already in the list.

What would be most desirable for Sage?
