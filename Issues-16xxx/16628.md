This is currently a ridiculous situation.  Some packages are only available in 'old-style', but 'new-style' ones aren't installable (as far as I can tell) with a single command `sage -do_this`.  The install guide still uses the `sage -i` syntax (which makes a lot of sense to me) and there is no place the new procedure is documented, not really even in the [developer guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#manual-package-build-and-installation), though people shouldn't have to look at that to (say) install the small groups package.

There is an issue with optional packages, namely that [http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/) only lists the old packages, but that doesn't seem to be what this ticket is about...
