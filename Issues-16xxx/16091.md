<a id='comment:8'></a>Helloooooooooo !!

The beginning looks right, but when doing a review you should also check that all doctests pass : those are the examples of Sage code that we add in the doc, i.e. what comes after "A trivial BIBD" in the branch.

Each time you review a patch, make sure that what the patch changes/adds is tested in one such example, and that it returns what it shoud :

by running "sage -t file.py", you tests all those lines. That's how we can spot a LOT of bugs before a release, as all functions of Sage are tested in this way. If you change something very fundamental in the code and make a mistake, very often the doctests of all functions that use the code that you changed will be buggy, and you can spot that by running "sage -t" on related files.

You can also run "sage -tp X file.py" where X is the number of CPU that you have,if you have many of them.
