Right now there are at least two stupid thing the user can do which can get him in trouble:

- type make in the `src/doc` directory : this **delete** the doc !
- type `sage docbuild reference/non_existing_doc` : this will create a directory is the doc system that prevents the doc from compiling and which even `make doc-clean` doesn't remove.

I'm adding two small safe guard to prevent those.
