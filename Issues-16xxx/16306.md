This branch does a couple small improvements to `src/sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx`, the most important one being a replacement of "== 0" by "== zero" since there are rings R whose zero element is not the same as R(0). (Two grammar errors in the doc are also fixed.)

Hi Darij,

1) Could you provide examples of rings for which the test fails? It is not clear to me why we need this and if you do not want that such bug reproduces you need to test it. More precisely, in the documentation write something along the lines of

```
In the following example, we show that we solve the issue in :trac:`16306` is solved::

    sage: a_nice_example()
    Hey!
```

2) why not

```
-            if self.get_unsafe(i,i) != 0:
+            if self.get_unsafe(i,i):
```
Do we know that `__nonzero__` always does what we expect?

Vincent

So, I do not understand the description of the ticket. You wrote `Not all rings R have their zero element equal to R(0)`. But now that I asked for an example, you say that no such ring exists.

Ok. Looks like a better argument than claiming that there are other rings. Could you provide timings then?

No. I was just asking. Because, if you care about speed, this is by far the fastest.

I hope you will agree that "all rings" and "all rings in Sage" are two rather different things... :)

Some timings on zero elements:

```
sage: %timeit ZZ(1) == 0
1000000 loops, best of 3: 419 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ(1).is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 389 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(1) == 0
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.15 µs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(1).is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 853 ns per loop
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: %timeit x == 0
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.76 µs per loop
sage: %timeit x.is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 223 ns per loop
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ); e = Sym.e(); ez = e.zero()
sage: %timeit ez == 0
10000 loops, best of 3: 27.9 µs per loop
sage: %timeit ez.is_zero()
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.45 µs per loop
```
and on nonzero elements:

```
sage: %timeit ZZ(2) == 0     
1000000 loops, best of 3: 416 ns per loop
sage: %timeit ZZ(2).is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 383 ns per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(2) == 0
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.15 µs per loop
sage: %timeit QQ(2).is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 877 ns per loop
sage: e2 = e[2]
sage: %timeit e2 == 0
10000 loops, best of 3: 27.8 µs per loop
sage: %timeit e2.is_zero()
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.91 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Integer(2) == 0     
1000000 loops, best of 3: 417 ns per loop
sage: %timeit Integer(2).is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 360 ns per loop
```

I don't know how much of the coercion overhead can be removed by improving the coercion system, but for now it looks like `is_zero` wins against coercion.

I see, the following tests are more appropriate

sage: n = 12
sage: %timeit n.is_zero()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 204 ns per loop
sage: zero = n.parent().zero()
sage: %timeit n == zero

Hi Darij,

What is the point of `if not self.get_unsafe(i,i) == zero:` instead of `if self.get_unsafe(i,i) != zero:`? Could you write an appropriate title and an appropriate description for the ticket?

I agree that it is a small ticket. But it is not a reason to not do it cleanly!

Thanks,

Oops, the use of "not" was a relic of the old version.

Part of the reason why comparison with parent().zero() takes so long is that parent() and zero() have to be computed. This can be done once per call of the method, and so the time amortizes quite well.

Hi Darij,

I still do not understand the motivation for the ticket: the function is not time critical and as you confirmed there is nowhere in Sage a ring whose zero is not 0. The code is better with the branch applied so I set to positive review.

Thank you!

This is a really minor change I wouldn't have done if the code in question wasn't my code from an older ticket.

FTR, there is one:

```
sage: T = TropicalSemiring(QQ)
sage: T(0)
0
sage: T.zero()
+infinity
```
(which we have to do because `TestSuite` uses `zero` as the additive identity, so we might want a separate categories for tropical stuff, but that's an issue for a different ticket).
