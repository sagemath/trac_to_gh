There is a natural way to construct a chain complex from the direct sum (Cartesian product) and tensor product of chain complexes. This also implements Koszul complexes.

<a id='comment:3'></a>For `cartesian_product`, I think that the requirement that the degrees of the differentials of the factors must agree is completely natural, but it should be mentioned in the docstring and it should probably be doctested. Same for `tensor`.

I think you can delete the line `zero = R.zero()` in `cartesian_product`.

This is odd behavior when `subdivide=True` and there is more than one factor:

```
sage: m = identity_matrix(QQ, 2)
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:m})
sage: ascii_art(C.cartesian_product([C,C], subdivide=True))
            [1 0 0 0|0 0]      
            [0 1 0 0|0 0]      
            [0 0 1 0|0 0]      
            [0 0 0 1|0 0]      
            [-------+---]      
            [0 0 0 0|1 0]      
            [0 0 0 0|0 1]      
 0 <-- C_1 <-------------- C_0 <-- 0 
```
I was expecting the matrix to have subdivisions for each factor, not just the last one. I guess iterating `matrix.block_diagonal` doesn't preserve earlier subdivisions as you add more blocks. Something similar happens with `tensor`.

Should it be `tensor` or `tensor_product`?

In `cartesian_product`, is it worth pointing out that `subdivide` must be specified explicitly? That is, you can't do `C.cartesian_product(D, True)`.

In `koszul_complex.py`, is the dot intentional in

```
###################################################.#####################
```
In that file, people have different styles, but I prefer importing functions only when you need them, not at the top-level. Having them at the top-level could potentially slow down startup times, I think.

In the `__classcall_private__` method for Koszul complexes, I don't understand the lines

```
if elements is None:
    elements = R
    if not elements:
        ...
```
If you call `KoszulComplex` with no arguments, you get an error before you reach this stage, so I think the second `if` can be skipped. I also gets various unhelpful error messages if I call `KoszulComplex(ZZ)` or `KoszulComplex(QQ)` without specifying `elements`. Maybe if `elements` is not specified, set it to an empty tuple instead? That is, if only one argument is passed, if it's an iterable, set `R` to be the parent of the first entry. Otherwise, set `R` to be that argument and set `elements` to be `()`. Or something like that.

I was a little surprised that your code for Koszul complexes didn't use the tensor product you had just defined. I'm guess that your way is faster?

Good point. Will do.

No, it's used when constructing the differentials.

I can fix this for the Cartesian product (which I could actually make smarter and faster). Will change.

> Something similar happens with `tensor`.


This one I'm not entirely sure I can fix. Would you be okay with just a `TODO` comment in the doc about this if I can't fix it?

> Should it be `tensor` or `tensor_product`?


The functorial construction is `tensor`, so I have to use that.

> In `cartesian_product`, is it worth pointing out that `subdivide` must be specified explicitly? That is, you can't do `C.cartesian_product(D, True)`.


Since it is part of the explicit arguments (which shows up under `?`), and we expect the user to have a basic knowledge of python syntax, I don't want to put any comments about this.

No, that's a typo.

Importing them at the top-level makes the call to the function faster, which is much more important in this case. However we can lazy import the `koszul_complex.py` module, which we should do since I feel that it's not likely too many people will use this.

Before it gets used, `zero` is redefined by `zero = matrix(R, [])`, isn't it?

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>The tensor product doesn't work if the chain complex is graded over a free abelian group: computing `(-1)^a` fails in this case, because `a` is a group element, not an integer. So you need to test for this case and replace `a` with `sum(a)` or something similar. (See also the `total_degree` function in my branch at #16508.)\n\nA related problem: if the differential has degree `d`, then I think the correct formula for the differential on the tensor product `x tensor y` involves the sign `(-1)^(|x| * |d|)`, where `|d|` is the degree of the differential on the second factor. With this sign convention (or with your choice of `(-1)^|x|`), if `C` and `D` are chain complexes with differentials of even degree, their tensor product will probably not be a chain complex any more, because the differential won't square to zero. It would be a good idea to add a warning about this in the documentation. (I know why you might want to grade over an arbitrary free abelian group, but I don't know why you would want a differential of even degree, so this is probably not a big deal.)\n\nOh, and `cartesian_product` fails if graded over something other than `ZZ`, because the grading group needs to be explicitly stated if it's not `ZZ`. So something like this should fix it:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/sage/homology/chain_complex.py b/src/sage/homology/chain_complex.py\nindex 1c6fdfb..29ce6e7 100644\n--- a/src/sage/homology/chain_complex.py\n+++ b/src/sage/homology/chain_complex.py\n@@ -1758,7 +1758,8 @@ class ChainComplex_class(Parent):\n         ret = {k: matrix.block_diagonal([d.get(k, zero) for d in diffs],\n                                          subdivide=subdivide)\n                for k in keys}\n-        return ChainComplex(ret, degree_of_differential=deg_diff)\n+        return ChainComplex(ret, degree_of_differential=deg_diff,\n+                            grading_group=self._grading_group)\n \n     def tensor(self, *factors, **kwds):\n         r\"\"\"\n```\nYou'll need a similar change at the end of the `tensor` method.",

<a id='comment:9'></a>The tensor product doesn't work if the chain complex is graded over a free abelian group: computing `(-1)^a` fails in this case, because `a` is a group element, not an integer. So you need to test for this case and replace `a` with `sum(a)` or something similar. (See also the `total_degree` function in my branch at #16508.)

A related problem: if the differential has degree `d`, then I think the correct formula for the differential on the tensor product `x tensor y` involves the sign `(-1)^(|x| * |d|)`, where `|d|` is the degree of the differential on the second factor. With this sign convention (or with your choice of `(-1)^|x|`), if `C` and `D` are chain complexes with differentials of even degree, their tensor product will probably not be a chain complex any more, because the differential won't square to zero. It would be a good idea to add a warning about this in the documentation. (I know why you might want to grade over an arbitrary free abelian group, but I don't know why you would want a differential of even degree, so this is probably not a big deal.)

Oh, and `cartesian_product` fails if graded over something other than `ZZ`, because the grading group needs to be explicitly stated if it's not `ZZ`. So something like this should fix it:

You'll need a similar change at the end of the `tensor` method.
