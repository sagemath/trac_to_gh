H(n,m) belongs to the holonomic repertoir and should be available in Sage, both numerically and symbolically. For some info, see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/uaA0yU7dZHU and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number

This is actually a defect because we leave a Maxima result undefined:

```
sage: sum(1/k^3,k,1,n)
gen_harmonic_number(3, n)
sage: gen_harmonic_number?
Object `gen_harmonic_number` not found.
```

For `maxima_lib` you definitely have to implement a special conversion rule (in both `special_max_to_sage` and `special_sage_to_max`). It'll be a very simple conversion rule, though, so it should be quick to write. There are plenty of examples of entries there already that have to do more complicated manipulations, so just swapping arguments will be easy to figure out.

For conversions to other maxima interfaces a good start may the special examples in `maxima_lib`. It seems that implementing `_maxima_init_evaled_` might do the trick for conversion to maxima.

The workhorse for the other direction is `sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string` which defines regexes for `polylog` etc., so it seems that any special conversion rules would need to be added there.

Your conversion is not *that* strange though. You just need to swap arguments, which means no special conversion at all as long as you can get it converted to a sage function that expects the arguments in the required order and produces the desired symbolic expression.

It seems that as long as you can get an entry into `sage.symbolic.pynac.symbol_table.get('maxima', {})` that has a argument-swapping function associated with it, you might be good to go. `sage.symbolic.pynac.register_symbol` might do the trick for that.

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'></a>\nA few remarks.\n- in the `maxima_harmonic` regular expression you seem to be trying to find the argument by matching subexpressions.

A few remarks.
- in the `maxima_harmonic` regular expression you seem to be trying to find the argument by matching subexpressions. I'm afraid that won't work reliably. If you put in arguments that use parentheses and commas itself and you'll find the regex gets it wrong. Indeed, the example you've taken it from is equally broken:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(psi(psi(x,x),x))._sage_()
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'psi[psi(x,x)](x)' in Sage
```
(never mind that this is a ValueError and not a TypeError). The maxima_lib specific translator does not have trouble with this:

```
sage: max_to_sr(maxima_calculus(psi(psi(x,x),x)).ecl())
psi(psi(x, x), x)
```
Regular languages are not sufficient to describe expression languages (the nested parentheses can't be expressed in a regular language--they need a stack or something similar). Can't you get that conversion by giving an appropriate `sage.symbolic.pynac.register_symbol`? then you get to use the parentheses parser that is already in place.

- for this line, you took a way too complicated example.

```
sage.functions.log.harmonic_number : lambda N,X : [[mqapply],[[max_harmo, max_array],X],N],
```
from

```
sage: maxima_calculus("gen_harmonic_number(a,b)").ecl()
<ECL: (($GEN_HARMONIC_NUMBER SIMP) $A $B)>
```
you see that this should simply be

```
sage.functions.log.harmonic_number : lambda N,X : [[max_harmo],X,N],
```
With your version one gets:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(EclObject([["mqapply"],[["$gen_harmonic_number","array"],10],20]))
gen_harmonic_number[10](20)
```
which is not the desired form, and you'll find this form can't be converted back either.

No, just use it. If you do `search_src("register_symbol")` you get a few hits on its use. The following seems to basically work without your patch so I hope you can adjust it for your purposes:

```
sage: var('x,t,s')
(x, t, s)
sage: function('g')
g
sage: def swap(a,b): return g(b,a)
sage: sage.symbolic.pynac.register_symbol(swap,{'maxima':'gen_harmonic_number'})
sage: sum(1/t^2,t,1,s)
g(s, 2)
```
That way, the parsing won't be more broken than for other functions (and it seems we're doing fine for most expressions nowadays). The regex for `psi` isn't really wrong, because it specifies there should be only digits between the square brackets. It is perhaps a little overly restrictive, though:

```
sage: psi(x,s)
psi(x, s)
sage: maxima_calculus(psi(x,s))
psi[x](s)
sage: maxima_calculus(psi(x,s))._sage_()
TypeError: unable to make sense of Maxima expression 'psi[x](s)' in Sage
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import max_to_sr
sage: max_to_sr(maxima_calculus(psi(x,s)).ecl()) #this doesn't rely on parsing or regexes
psi(x, s)
```
I think "parsing" psi via regex was just a quick fix around the fact that the expression parser doesn't know what to do with square brackets (and since they're rare, you can get away with not really parsing them properly). In your case, round brackets are so common that you'll quickly get caught if you don't deal with them properly. Luckily, the parser knows how to deal with them, you just have to swap the arguments.

Done. I'm not sure if Maxima does the right thing here by expanding the sum. This can get messy for big integers:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(harmonic_number(3,harmonic_number(x,3),hold=True)).sage()
1/3^harmonic_number(x, 3) + 1/2^harmonic_number(x, 3) + 1
```

I also removed the restriction on the second argument.

Ouch, given what we've just run into on #16697 with derivatives, our `_maxima_init_evaled_` hack for swapping arguments would fail in the presence of derivatives:

```
maxima_calculus(harmonic_number(x,y).diff(x))
```
Should we disallow differentiating harmonic numbers? Otherwise I think we need to rewrite how differential operators get translated. Currently, given:

```
D[0,1,2](f)(u,v,w)
```
gets translated basically to

```
"diff("+"f"+"(u,v,w)"+",u,1,v,1,w,1)"
```
Instead, we could make the *expression* f(u,v,w) and convert that to a maxima string *as a whole* and compose that with the rest. Then we WOULD be going through `_maxima_init_evaled_` etc. There are situations where this is a little more complicated: when "u,v,w" are not pure, distinct, variables, then sage needs to substitute temporary place holder variables in order to express the `D[0,1,2]` operator in Leibnitz notation. (and then, after differentiation, substitute the values). Example:

```
sage: function('f')
sage: diff( f(x+1),x)._maxima_init_()
"at(diff(''f(t0), t0, 1), [t0 = x + 1])"
sage: maxima_calculus(diff( f(x+1),x))
?%at('diff(f(t0),t0,1),[t0=x+1])
```
Presently, those temporary variables `t0` do not live in Sage at all. With this change, we would have to instantiate them as symbolic variables in sage to get them converted. (I have checked before, and the `at` substitutions in maxima happen simultaneously, so symbol clashes shouldn't be an issue, other than the possibility of assumptions interfering)

Ouch, this actually shows a missed conversion:

```
sage: maxima_calculus(f(x).diff(x))
'diff(f(_SAGE_VAR_x),_SAGE_VAR_x,1)
sage: maxima_calculus(f(x+1).diff(x)) #this is bad!
?%at('diff(f(t0),t0,1),[t0=x+1])
```
and to compare:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import sr_to_max
sage: maxima_calculus(sr_to_max(f(x+1).diff(x)))
?%at('diff(f(_SAGE_VAR_t0),_SAGE_VAR_t0,1),[_SAGE_VAR_t0=_SAGE_VAR_x+1])
sage: maxima_calculus(sr_to_max(f(x).diff(x)))
'diff(f(_SAGE_VAR_x),_SAGE_VAR_x,1)
```
How the temporary variable t0 gets represented doesn't matter, but `x` should absolutely be converted to `_SAGE_VAR_x`, in all cases.

The problem is in [line 505](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/develop/src/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py#n505). Changing it like this:

```diff
-            subs = ["%s = %s"%(t,a) for t,a in zip(temp_args,args)]
+            subs = ["%s = %s"%(t._maxima_init_(),a._maxima_init_()) for t,a in zip(temp_args,args)]
```
and some more changes of the same nature should do the trick.

This code also shows that the temporary variables are instantiated in sage anyway, so changing the conversion wouldn't be so bad.

I don't agree with `sum(QQ(1)/(k**m) for k in range(1,z+1))` since the result is always in `QQ`. I would use `srange` to respect the input type (`foo in ZZ` does not imply that the type of `foo` is `ZZ`):

```
sum(1/(k**m) for k in srange(1,z+1))

Artificial example (this could be a doctest):

```
sage: harmonic_number._eval_(10, Qp(5)(1))
7381/2520
```
but the answer should be

```
sage: Qp(5)(harmonic_number(10))

I think this is the only example where `H(n,m)` would have a useful meaning, and it can be computed, as you show, by staying in the rationals and converting the result. Trying to support this case however will fail in `BuiltinFunction.__call__`:

```
sage: harmonic_number(5,Qp(5)(8))

Let's document here that both forms for the generalized harmonic numbers

```
H(q/p,m) = zeta(m) - p^m * sum(1/(q+p*k)^m, k, 1, oo)   (Wikipedia 2015-Mar-07)

H(k,n) = binomial(n+k-1,k-1)*(harmonic_number(n+k-1)-harmonic_number(k-1))
         (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicNumber.html eq. 55)
```
are both wrong, with the counterexamples `H(5/2,3)=1/27*sqrt(3) + 1/8*sqrt(2) + 1` and `H(5,3)=256103/216000`.

EDIT. no, the first is right, my implementation was wrong.

Disagree. That should be the result of `harmonic_number._eval_(Qp(5)(10), 1)`. Anything else than a rational as second argument makes no sense.

I have now adapted the code so it gives back the same type as the input, but wrapped as `Expression`. Also, you can expect that only if it can be converted back, which is not the case for `H(p/q)` or `H(anything, p/q)` as the result is not rational.

I have merged the code with the current codebase and simplified `Function_harmonic_number_generalized._eval_` and ` Function_harmonic_number._eval_` (please check that I didn't oversimplify).

When merging the code into the current codebase, there was the following conflict in `symbolic/function.pyx`:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
                # There is no natural coercion from QQbar to the symbolic ring
                # in order to support
                #     sage: QQbar(sqrt(2)) + sqrt(3)
                #     3.146264369941973?
                # to work around this limitation, we manually convert
                # elements of QQbar to symbolic expressions here
                from sage.rings.qqbar import QQbar, AA
                from sage.rings.padics.padic_generic_element import pAdicGenericElement
                nargs = [None]*len(args)
                for i in range(len(args)):
                    carg = args[i]
                    if (isinstance(carg, Element) and
                            ((<Element>carg)._parent is QQbar or
                            (<Element>carg)._parent is AA or
                            isinstance(carg, pAdicGenericElement))):
                        nargs[i] = SR(carg)
                    else:
                        try:
                            nargs[i] = SR.coerce(carg)
                        except Exception:
                            raise TypeError, "cannot coerce arguments: %s"%(err)
                args = nargs
>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD
```
It was unclear to me to which degree the underlying code had changed, which is why this code for working with `QQbar` over the symbolic ring is not merged into the branch I posted.

In any case, it seems to me that any such change might be better suited for a separate ticket because it is not specific to harmonic numbers.  Consequently, I also removed from `symbolic/function.pyx` the doctest

```
            sage: binomial(Qp(2)(9),5)
            126
```
as well as from `functions/log.py` the doctests:

```
            sage: harmonic_number(Qp(5)(10),1)
            4*5^-1 + 2 + 2*5 + 4*5^2 + 3*5^3 + 5^4 + ...
            sage: harmonic_number(Qp(5)(10),2)
            4*5^-1 + 3 + 5 + 3*5^2 + 2*5^3 + 3*5^5 + ...
...
            sage: harmonic_number(Qp(5)(3))
            1 + 5 + 4*5^2 + 4*5^4 + 4*5^6 + ...
```
I think that a separate ticket should be used for uniformly fixing the coercion/conversion of p-adics to the symbolic ring.  Since the present code doesn't touch these issues, I have removed the dependency on #17790.

By the way, I liked the symbolic sum you were using for computing `harmonic_number(n)` when `n` is a rational number.  While testing this, I noticed that `sum(1/x/(1/5+x),x,1,infinity)` results in an error.  On the other hand, using the present code, we have:

```
sage: harmonic_number(1/5)
euler_gamma + psi(6/5)
sage: _.full_simplify()
-1/4*(sqrt(5) + 1)*log(1/2*sqrt(5) + 5/2) + 1/4*(sqrt(5) - 1)*log(-1/2*sqrt(5) + 5/2) - 1/10*pi*sqrt(10*sqrt(5) + 25) - log(5) + 5
```

The only other changes I made were small touches to the doc strings.  A quick `sage -t src/sage/functions` did not reveal any troubles.

Thank you for the nice work!  It would be great to finally have harmonic numbers in Sage.
