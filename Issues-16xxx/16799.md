Hello again !

* You say that the constant term is expected to be 0 in the doc, but in the examples it is equal to 1

* You can use `IndependentSets(g,complement=True)` instead of `IndependentSets(g.complement())`. Computing the complement of a sparse graph is rather slow.

* The documentation of a function should begin with a short one-line description. Anything can follow, it can be as long as you want, though. It can be the line that appears right next to the function, in the index at the top of the file

* If you change 
  `return sum([number_of[i]*t**i for i in range(self.order()+1)])`

  into

  `return sum([coeff*t**i for i,coeff in enumerate(number_of) if coeff])`

  You avoid computing the `t**i` that will be multiplied by 0. It does not bring any detectable speedup in this case, however.
