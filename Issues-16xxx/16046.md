```
The following doctest in `sage.rings.number_field.order.absolute_order_from_module_generators` is incorrect:

```
sage: F.<alpha> = NumberField(x**4+3)
sage: F.order([alpha**2], allow_subfield=True)
Order in Number Field in alpha with defining polynomial x^4 + 3
```

This should be a order in a smaller field. The code for `allow_subfield` seems incomplete.
