Isolated states are currently not created in `FiniteStateMachine.product_FiniteStateMachine`. This may lead to products without any states. This is not desirable: there might be final output words, hooks, etc.

Planned behaviour:

```
sage: F = Transducer(initial_states=[0])
sage: F.add_state(1)
1
sage: G = Transducer(initial_states=['A'])
sage: F.product_FiniteStateMachine(G, None).states()
[(0, 'A')]
sage: F.product_FiniteStateMachine(
....:     G, None, only_accessible_components=False).states()
[(0, 'A'), (1, 'A')]
```

Current behaviour is that the two last tests yield `[]`.
