Currently (i.e. on sage 6.1.1), the discriminant computation fails with a segmenttation fault when the coefficients are too complicated. For example:

```python
PR.<b,t1,t2,x1,y1,x2,y2> = QQ[]
PRmu.<mu> = PR[]
E1 = diagonal_matrix(PR, [1, b^2, -b^2])
RotScale = matrix(PR, [[1, -t1, 0], [t1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
E2 = diagonal_matrix(PR, [1, 1, 1+t1^2])*RotScale.transpose()*E1*RotScale
Transl = matrix(PR, [[1, 0, -x1], [0, 1, -y1], [0, 0, 1]])
E3 = Transl.transpose()*E2*Transl
E4 = E3.subs(t1=t2, x1=x2, y1=y2)
det(mu*E3 + E4).discriminant()
```

Apparently the Python interpreter reaches some limit on the depth of the call stack, since it seems to call `symtable_visit_expr` from `Python-2.7.6/Python/symtable.c:1191` over and over and over again. But this ticket here is not about fixing Python. (If you want a ticket for that, feel free to create one and provide a reference here.)

Instead, one should observe that the above is only a discriminant of a third degree polynomial. As such, it has an easy and well-known formula for the discriminant. Plugging the complicated coefficients into this easy formula leads to the solution rather quickly (considering the immense size of said solution). So perhaps we should employ this approach in the `discriminant` method.

I've [discussed this question on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/fABfhHyioa0/discussion), and will probably continue the discussion. Right now, I'm unsure about when to choose a new method over the existing one. Should it be based on degree, using hardcoded versions of the well-known discriminants for lower degrees? Or should it rather be based on base ring, thus employing a computation over some simple generators instead of the full coefficients if the base ring is a polynomial ring or some other fairly complex object. Here is a code snippet to illustrate the latter idea:

```python
def generic_discriminant(p):
    """
    Compute discriminant of univariate (sparse or dense) polynomial.
   
    The discriminant is computed in two steps. First all non-zero
    coefficients of the polynomial are replaced with variables, and
    the discriminant is computed using these variables. Then the
    original coefficients are substituted into the result of this
    computation. This should be faster in many cases, particularly
    with big coefficients like complicated polynomials. In those
    cases, the matrix computation on simple generators is a lot
    faster, and the final substitution is cheaper than carrying all
    that information along at all times.
    """
    pr = p.parent()
    if not pr.ngens() == 1:
        raise ValueError("Must be univariate")
    ex = p.exponents()
    pr1 = PolynomialRing(ZZ, "x", len(ex))
    pr2.<y> = pr1[]
    py = sum(v*y^e for v, e in zip(pr1.gens(), ex))
    d = py.discriminant()
    return d(p.coefficients())
```

Personally I think I prefer a case distinction based on base ring, or a combination. If we do the case distinction based on base ring, then I'd also value some input as to what rings should make use of this new approach, and how to check for them. For example, I just noticed that #15061 discusses issues with discriminants of polynomials over power series. So I guess those might benefit from this approach as well.

What I implemented so far is a case distinction based on the base ring, with the new implementation being used for multivariate polynomials and power series.

I implemented the new code in the existing method for now, in part because I wasn't sure whether I should add new methods (e.g. `discriminant_by_resultant` and `discriminant_by_substitution`) or rather an `algorithm` argument for the `discriminant` method. In the latter case, the code would stay in that method but be reorganized because the substitution version could call the resultant version instead of executing that computation directly.

I'm not sure about this whole `ZeroDivisionError` stuff from #11782 resp. [a224fe3](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/a224fe31d5c960ce56acf2e09e0f408ef92c0899). When doing the substitution approach, there should be no zero divisors, so replacing `self` by `poly` in that exception handler is only for the sake of consistency, but not really required. I guess if I were to write code for the substitution approach exclusively, I might consider using `// poly[n]` instead of `* an` to avoid the detour to the fraction field.

This looks good and passes doctests.  However, I'm wondering if you couldn't be convinced to adopt John Cremona's [proposal on sage-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/fABfhHyioa0/kPlhGN4Ri-EJ) to have a separate function `generic_univariate_discriminant()` (or similar), which caches its output, and hardcodes it for small degrees.  This would be useful for two reasons:

- it would make the `discriminant()` method cleaner and therefore more attractive to add an `algorithm` flag and/or a more sophisticated algorithm selection heuristic.
I would think `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element` would be a logical place for such a function, although `sage.rings.invariant_theory` would also be defensible.

Here is a simple function to compute the universal discriminant:

```python
def universal_discriminant(n):
    r"""Return the discriminant of the 'universal' univariate polynomial
    `a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0` in `\ZZ[a_0, \ldots, a_n][x]`."""
    R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, n + 1, 'a')
    S = PolynomialRing(R, 'x')
    return S(list(R.gens())).discriminant()
```

Thanks, this looks very good.  You're probably right about not hardcoding the polynomials.

If you want; as you will have seen, authors for some other additions/changes are listed, but it is certainly not done in a very systematic way througout Sage.  In any case, your changes and authorship will be remembered by the revision control system, and using `git annotate` gives a line-by-line overview of who wrote/changed what.

Could you also fill in your name (i.e. real name, not Trac username) in the "Author" field of this ticket?

I will test this and then set it to positive review.

FWIW the segfault in Python was fixed in newer Python versions: http://bugs.python.org/issue5765

For some reason (it seems just developer resources) a version of the patch was never backported to 2.7.  I might take a stab at that (and open a separate ticket if so).  Note the patch doesn't magically allow unlimited stack depth and one can still blow the stack.  But with the default settings it will raise a `RuntimeError` instead, and give one the opportunity to increase the limit with `sys.setrecursionlimit`.
