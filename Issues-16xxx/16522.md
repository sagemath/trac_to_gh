We have several places where lazy_import objects are used in a way that prevents them from behaving as designed.

The original idea of `LazyImport` proxies is that they have a pointer to the namespace in which they are bound, so that once the import gets triggered, the proxy object redirects the binding in the namespace to point straight to the proxied object. Once this redirection has happened, the proxy object should not play a role anymore and no performance impact should happen at all.

The problem occurs from statements such as:

```
calculus/all.py:1:from calculus import maxima as maxima_calculus
```
This doesn't work, because this is a `LazyImport` proxy, which needs to know the namespace in which it is bound to do the proper replacement. This one is tied to `sage.calculus.calculus.maxima`, so it can't rebind the global `maxima_calculus`. Indeed:

```
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: hash(maxima_calculus)
-7971541566211231133
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLib'>
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
The binding of `maxima_calculus` in the global namespace (and the one in `calculus.all` too) remains to the `LazyImport` proxy. Thus we suffer from indirection overhead [one might worry we'd suffer repeated extraneous dictionary modifications, but `LazyImport` is smart enough to only attempt to rebind `sage.calculus.calculus.maxima` only on the first access] as well as problems that things like `id(LazyImportShim)` and `type(LazyImportShim)` are not what they're supposed to model.

If instead we do:

```
sage: lazy_import('sage.interfaces.maxima_lib','maxima','maxima_calculus')
```
we see that things do resolve:

```
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: hash(maxima_calculus)
-7971541566211231133
sage: type(maxima_calculus)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLib'>
```
Other bindings need their own chance to resolve, but do:

```
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: hash(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
-7971541566211231133
sage: type(sage.calculus.calculus.maxima)
<class 'sage.interfaces.maxima_lib.MaximaLib'>
```
The obvious fix: in `calculus.all`, import `maximalib` directly and lazily, rather than indirectly from `sage.calculus.calculus` only kicks the can further, since in `sage.all` we have `from sage.calculus.all import *` (which I think is where it really gets placed in the global sage namespace).

Ouch. This is difficult to fix. Sure, we can put in `sage/calculus/all.py`:

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
#this is sage.calculus.calculus.maxima. It needs to be lazily imported.
lazy_import("sage.interfaces.maxima_lib","maxima","maxima_calculus")
```
but that only solves one step of the problem. Next we get in `sage/all.py`:

```
from sage.calculus.all   import *
```
so if we want to solve this problem, we'd have to do so manually unless we come up with very smart hack in `lazy_import`. There are other lazy_imports of this type:

```
sage: type(Riemann_Map)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: %time hash(Riemann_Map)
CPU times: user 42 ms, sys: 5 ms, total: 47 ms
Wall time: 45.2 ms
8795750155546
sage: %time hash(Riemann_Map)
CPU times: user 0 ns, sys: 0 ns, total: 0 ns
Wall time: 7.87 µs
8795750155546
sage: type(Riemann_Map)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
```
Exactly the same story. Luckily, the lazy_import proxy objects are pretty transparent when the import has already happened, so it's not too much of an issue when they're in the way (unless you're in a very tight loop). I'll be upgrading the severity and scope of this ticket.

Seeing how many improperly placed LazyImport (i.e., LazyImport objects that do have a namespace set, but it doesn't match the namespace in which they are bound, or the name they are bound to doesn't match the `_as_name` attribute):

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport, attributes, clean_namespace
def misbound_lazies(S):
    return [k for k,v in S.items() if
        type(v) is LazyImport and
        attributes(v)['_namespace'] is not None and
            (attributes(v)['_namespace'] is not S or
             attributes(v)['_as_name'] != k)]
M=[(k,len(misbound_lazies(m.__dict__))) for k,m in sys.modules.iteritems() if m is not None]
```
gives currently:

```
sage: [m for m in M if m[1] > 0]
[('sage.groups.all', 9),
 ('sage.combinat.non_decreasing_parking_function', 1),
 ('sage.groups.libgap_mixin', 1),
 ('__main__', 330),
 ('sage.categories.all', 1),
 ('sage.combinat.all', 23),
 ('sage.calculus.all', 1),
 ('sage.tensor.all', 1),
 ('sage.combinat.integer_vector', 1),
 ('sage.geometry.all', 3),
 ('sage.graphs.digraph', 1),
 ('sage.all_cmdline', 330),
 ('sage.combinat.partition_tuple', 1),
 ('sage.algebras.lie_algebras.affine_lie_algebra', 1),
 ('sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_generic', 1),
 ('sage.schemes.all', 4),
 ('sage.rings.all', 13),
 ('sage.combinat.set_partition_ordered', 1),
 ('sage.categories.groups', 1),
 ('sage.graphs.generic_graph', 1),
 ('sage.algebras.all', 2),
 ('sage.modular.all', 4),
 ('sage.combinat.integer_vectors_mod_permgroup', 1),
 ('sage.dynamics.all', 7),
 ('sage.combinat.composition', 1),
 ('sage.combinat.partition', 1),
 ('sage.all', 314)]
```
Executing:

```
for m in sys.modules.values():
    if m is not None:
        clean_namespace(m)
```
naturally resolves all these. Two options to use this in practice:
* put a `clean_namespace(globals())` at the end of offending modules.
* execute this on `sys.modules.values()` at the end of initialization in sage

Comments welcome.

rebased branch; now we just introduce the requisite helper routines in lazy_import and implement cleaning of `sage.all` and `user_globals` upon initialization. I think these are the two places where it's really hard to mandate that lazy_imports are done explicitly.

Similar cleaning operations could be placed in the construction of other namespaces too, but with a bit diminishing returns.

Oh cool! That's a textbook example of why `LazyImport` of anything else than a function is bound to cause trouble. See this line:

```
from sage.rings.semirings.all import NN
```
and then later the test:

```
        if n is None or n is NN or n is NonNegativeIntegers():
```
so `NN` is a very specific `LazyImport` shim (that will not be resolved, not even if it gets used properly, because only its identity is used: attribute lookups never happen on it) and this code only ever worked because the global namespace had *that exact shim*. It never actually tested for the actual `NN` object.

So this is actually a separate bug of something that has never worked.

(I think `NN` was originally lazy_imported because it plays a lot of category shenanigans, which is very expensive for startup. Hence, it was felt its initialization should be delayed. But that means you end up with an object that has a meaningful identity, but that identity can change. In fact, if people feel it should have a `LazyImport` shim around it that delays its initialization, it should probably be one with `namespace==None`. Then at least its `id` will be consistent (but its type info will be wrong, and one would have to mandate that people only use the shim if they want to test for identity ...)

That's why we need `NaturalNumbers()` instead of `NN` [```EDIT:``` scratch that! 0 is in NN in sage, apparently. Must be the french influence. The thing is actually called `NonNegativeIntegerSemiring()`. I guess "NN" for "NonNegative" is not a bad abbreviation :-)] if delayed init is important ... or custom-write the delayed init for NN so that identity and type info is correct(ish) from the start.

The current use in `partitions` is absolutely garbage.

- do away with NN and have people call `NonNegativeIntegerSemiring()` or some nicer-sounding alias if they need it. (apparently ZZ is way cheaper to construct)

To get an idea of the cost of initializing `NN`:

```
sage: %time NN(1)
CPU times: user 5.99 ms, sys: 11 µs, total: 6 ms
Wall time: 5.42 ms
1
sage: %time NN(1)
CPU times: user 22 µs, sys: 2 µs, total: 24 µs
Wall time: 27.7 µs
1
```

It makes sense to me to just honestly import `NN` at the start, especially as you say, since it is so foundational to mathematics. Then it also makes sense to lazily import lots of other things, like the interfaces to various optional packages or other rarely used items — the more specialized or rarely used, the more we should try to avoid initializing them at startup. I would hope that the savings from lazily importing other things would outweigh the added costs of initializing `NN`.

I think changing NN to be initialized (and hence normally imported everywhere rather than lazily) deserves its own ticket, because it has a whole bunch of performance assessment it will need. Once that and/or this ticket is closer to merge, we can figure out which one will be based on which (since the fix to `Partitions` here should probably be done differently if NN never comes in a `LazyImport` shim -- although the code proposed now would still be correct and probably doesn't cause much overhead compared to what `Partitions` is already doing).

To get a bit of an idea of the costs involved in `Partitions` (the following are each done in a fresh session):

It looks like NN isn't actually used by bare `Partitions`:

```
sage: NN
Non negative integer semiring
sage: %time _=Partitions()
CPU times: user 22 µs, sys: 2 µs, total: 24 µs
Wall time: 28.4 µs
```

```
sage: %time _=Partitions()
CPU times: user 24 µs, sys: 2 µs, total: 26 µs
Wall time: 29.6 µs
```
So it's actually crazy that `Partitions(NN)` is even supported. It's just slower, with the same result:

```
sage: %time c=Partitions(NN)
CPU times: user 1.85 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.85 ms
Wall time: 1.62 ms
```

```
sage: NN
Non negative integer semiring
sage: %time c=Partitions(NN)
CPU times: user 171 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 171 µs
Wall time: 185 µs
```
An argument forces its construction of NN to compare the argument to it:

```
sage: %time c=Partitions(4)
CPU times: user 2.01 ms, sys: 2 µs, total: 2.01 ms
Wall time: 1.98 ms
```

```
sage: NN
Non negative integer semiring
sage: %time c=Partitions(4)
CPU times: user 448 µs, sys: 47 µs, total: 495 µs
Wall time: 498 µs
sage: %time c=Partitions(5)
CPU times: user 156 µs, sys: 16 µs, total: 172 µs
Wall time: 175 µs
sage: %time c=Partitions(7)
CPU times: user 81 µs, sys: 8 µs, total: 89 µs
```
(and as you can see, there's a lot of other overhead as well on the first call -- but NN is pretty noticeable!)
In fact, the pure init of `NN` doesn't seem as expensive as `6ms` quoted above. That must have a lot of coercion discovery on it too. It varies quite wildly (and you can't put it in a `%timeit`):

```
sage: type(NN)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: %time _=NN._get_object()
CPU times: user 730 µs, sys: 982 µs, total: 1.71 ms
Wall time: 1.56 ms
sage: type(NN)
<class 'sage.rings.semirings.non_negative_integer_semiring.NonNegativeIntegerSemiring_with_category'>
```

```
sage: type(NN)
<class 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: %time _=NN._get_object()
CPU times: user 1.8 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.8 ms
Wall time: 1.66 ms
```
so it's probably more like 2ms than 6ms.

But a big take-away: supporting `Partitions(NN)` is just a way of having a slower way of constructing the same thing and generating more errors. The routine should just NOT take a parent as first argument: `None` works much better. As you can see, allowing `n=NN` as well as `n=None` (the default value) is actually very expensive. So not only is this causing a major headache, it's also a bad idea to have `NN` referenced in `Partitions` at all.

# Analysis of misbound lazies

## In sage.categories.groups:

```
from sage.categories.cartesian_product import CartesianProductsCategory, cartesian_product
```
and the definition there:

```
# Moved to avoid circular imports
lazy_import('sage.categories.sets_cat', 'cartesian_product')
```
so perhaps we can just change it to

```
from sage.categories.sets_cat import cartesian_product
```

## sage.combinat.integer_vector : NN

##  sage.combinat.composition :

```
from sage.categories.cartesian_product import cartesian_product
```

##  sage.combinat.path_enumeration :

```
from sage.categories.cartesian_product import cartesian_product
```

## sage.modular.arithgroup.congroup_generic :

```
from sage.groups.matrix_gps.all import MatrixGroup
```
where it is:

```
lazy_import('sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated', 'MatrixGroup')
```

## sage.combinat.partition_tuple : NN

## sage.combinat.partition : NN

## sage.combinat.non_decreasing_parking_function : NN

## sage.combinat.set_partition_ordered : cartesian_product
