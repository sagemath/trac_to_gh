In order to implement difference families (see #16461), I need a method to list multiplicative cosets of a finite field. Here it is.

See also [this thread on sage-nt](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/BlkL5JjfXT4).

The method `cyclotomic_cosets` is implemented at the level of rings (in `sage.categories.rings`) and the corresponding global function is deprecated. The code is also adapted in `sage.coding.coding_constructions` to take care of the change.

We also correct a bug in `sage.coding.coding_constructions` where `is_a_splitting` returned a pair and hence **always** evaluated to `True` in if statements.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hello Vincent !

There is a small commit on public/16464 for typos.

I've got a question on the documentation, however : you say at the beginnig that "the orbits of the group action of `R^*` on `R` are called the cyclotomic cosets". From which it follows that the only two cyclotomic cosets of a finite Field are `R^*` and 0, doesn't it ?

I mean : your function takes `q` as an argument, though your definition of what a cyclotomic coset is does not involve `q` in any way. Sooooo I don't get it : shouldn't they be called "cyclotomic cosets with respect to q" or something ?

1)

```

+        raise ValueError("the argument n must be an odd prime")
```

Why don't you test that `n` is odd ?

2) Why would this be allowed ? It really does NOT have the same behaviour.

```
-    n = max(S1+S2)+1
-    if not(is_a_splitting(S1,S2,n)):
+    n = len(S1) + len(S2) + 1
+    if not is_a_splitting(S1,S2,n):

Hum. If n is prime and not 2 it is necessarily odd.

It does. `is_a_splitting(S1,S2,n)` answers `True` if the input is a partition `(S1,S2)` of `{1,...,n-1}` (+ a condition on the partition). So I just changed the code to avoid the concatenation and the max.

Do you agree?

<a id='comment:34'></a>Hi Nathann,

Because of this error, I notice that in Sage rings are not necessarily commutative. It would hence be better have `cyclotomic_cosets` only at the level of commutative rings... (you do not want it for the set of `2x2` matrices over `GF(3)`).

Please review it again (it is only a cut and paste).
