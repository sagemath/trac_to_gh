Further optimizations for graph iterations following #16005.

The sparse graph backend (i.e. `sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraph` and `sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend`) lacks optimization especially for edge iteration. We need to see what is the best we can do and work on it!

Replying to [ncohen](#comment%3A2):
> Isn't there a problem if you want to iterate over the edges but stop midway ? Isn't it the case that the array is never deallocated ?


You are right, with a code like

```
sage: it = build_me_an_edge_iterator()
sage: it.next()
sage: del it
```
we keep an array never deallocated. But what happens for alloc/dealloc inside cdef functions?

A solution would be to implement an iterator in Cython with direct access to the `SparseGraph` (doing all proper deallocation in `__dealloc__`). Is it worth it?

I would say that it never happens, and that the only way is to create a class with a constructor/destructor. Which is a lot of code.

Well, the question is whether an iterator is cheaper than a malloc.
