Add support for signed permutations to Sage.

Statistics:
- Which entries are less than zero (done)
- Number of entries less than zero (done)
- Location of descents (keeping in mind there's a 'descent at zero' for signed permutations if the first entry is negative) (done)
- Number of descents (done)
- fdes and fmaj (done)
- Number of Inversions (done)
Most of these don't have proper docstrings yet.

Other things that should be easy:
- 'Absolute value map' (ie, remove all signs). (done)
- Reverse/complement
- Longest Element
- To_matrix (make it compatible with the existing Weyl group stuff?)

Things that might take some time to do the 'right' way:
- Pattern Avoidance
- Bruhat Order
- Signed RSK

<a id='comment:5'></a>Some other things that would be nice:

- Make this into a permutation group (similar to `SymmetricGroup`).
- Add methods to transform elements into a `SymmetricGroup` elements via the natural "diagram folding".
- Implement the even signed permutation group.
- Implement the natural coercions between the above.

I can also do (some of) the reviewing when this is ready too.

I'm finally in a position to work on this again. Should I work off what you have in #17411 to add the stuff here that doesn't overlap? (Looks like that's mostly the permutation statistics.)

<a id='comment:20'></a>That one is a bit more debatable whether we want that or not. Of course, you can do this:

```
sage: SP = SignedPermutations(3)
sage: SP([2,-1,3])
[2, -1, 3]
sage: SP([2,-1,3])^2
[-1, -2, 3]
```
However, it is in line with everything else we do for similar things, so I don't have any real objections.
