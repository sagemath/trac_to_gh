Currently, this does not work:

```
sage: F0.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3))
sage: R.<y> = F0[]
sage: F.<y> = F0.extension(y^2 - x)
sage: S.<t> = F[]
sage: f = t^2 - x
NotImplementedError
```

This is implemented here: https://github.com/saraedum/sage/blob/experimental/src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py#L1717

Keywords: sd59, sd86.5

Author: Julian RÃ¼th

Dependencies: #16564, #26128
