It would be cool to have an explicit error message when there is no output due to this 10ms thing. Could you also add this new file to the reference manual ?

By the way, what it this `:param s:/:type s:` ? I never saw them before. Could you wrap that in a "INPUT" block btw (the two crun functions need one) ?

Also : the gif output is cool but would there  be a way to make it available through %crun directly ? Or at least crun("cmd") ?

There is also an unfinished sentence in the doc :

```
By default, a if 
```
