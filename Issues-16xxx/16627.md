```
sage: P8 = polytopes.n_cube(4)
sage: P8.base_ring?
Type:            instancemethod
String form:     <bound method Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category.element_class.base_ring of A 4-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 16 vertices>
Definition:      P8.base_ring(self)
Docstring:
   Return the base ring.

   OUTPUT:

   Either "QQ" (exact arithmetic using gmp, default) or "RDF" (double
   precision floating-point arithmetic)

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: triangle = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]])
      sage: triangle.base_ring() == ZZ
      True
```
I particularly like how the **example** directly contradicts the documentation ;-)  Anyway, all options should be tested.

Although this was supposed to be a very simple ticket, I wonder if I may as reviewer ask for two doctests testing the cdd reps get mad at bad base ring input...
