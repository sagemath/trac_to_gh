When calling the change ring function on affine morphisms an index out of bounds error occurs:

```

 sage: A.<x,y,z> = AffineSpace(RR,3)
 sage: h = Hom(A,A)
 sage: f = h([x^2+1.5,y^3,z^5-2.0])
 sage: f.change_ring(CC)

```

<a id='comment:3'></a>I'd like to see the example a little more complex. Say at least dimension 2 with non-constant polynomials.

For the code itself you can get rid of the helper list F with the following

```
G=[F.change_ring(R) for F in self._polys]
```

Another thought. What happens when the domain and codomain are different? This code is assuming that the domain and codomain are the same.

The functionality looks fine at this point, but while you're fixing this function, there are a couple other things to fix

1) there are many instances of trailing white space that need to be removed

2) fix the formatting for the earlier examples for this function

3) the output doesn't seem like an accurate description. Perhaps something more like in the description: a :class:`SchemeMorphism_polynomial` which is `self` coerced to `R`
