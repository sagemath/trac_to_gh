See [this sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/HLoWHsNmYM4) discussion, where it is pointed out that both Maxima and Sympy can return solutions to integrals using a symbolic sum of roots, e.g. 

```
sage: f=1/(x^4+x^3+1)
sage: fm=f._maxima_()
sage: fm.integrate()
'integrate(1/(x^4+x^3+1),x)
sage: fs=f._sympy_()
sage: fs.integrate()
RootSum(229*_t**4 + 6*_t**2 + _t + 1, Lambda(_t, _t*log(-37785*_t**3/3547 - 5496*_t**2/3547 + 12979*_t/3547 + x + 691/3547)))
```
(Thanks to mmarco for this.)

Perhaps this shouldn't be the default return for integrals but it certainly could be useful.

The object itself can be created in pynac using algebraic numbers. The problem is to handle it then. I posted an example in the sage-devel discussion.
