```
The current version of Denis Simon's 2-descent program (in Sage since #11005) has a bug:

```
sage: K.<y> = NumberField(x^4 + x^2 - 7);
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K, [1, 0, 5*y^2 + 16, 0, 0])
sage: E.simon_two_descent(lim1=2, limtriv=3)
[0, 0, []]
```
The rank is in fact 1, and a correct return value would be `(1, 1, [(-369/25*y^3 + 539/25*y^2 - 1178/25*y + 1718/25 : -27193/125*y^3 + 39683/125*y^2 - 86816/125*y + 126696/125 : 1)])`.

This ticket is just to fix this as quickly as possible; it should eventually be fixed in a new version of Simon's program.

I see that you changed ell.gp. Is this good ? It is very very likely that the next update of simon's scripts will forget to make this patch-fix of a upstream file. Would it not be better to tell the author to change this in his version and we update our file ? This is a genuine question as I am not sure what is better. One thing to bear in mind is that it seems that Denis has not been very active on the bugs in his script recently.
