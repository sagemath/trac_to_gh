**It was decided that flatsurf would be developed as an independent package**

Old description

The ticket introduce improvements to the current code in `sage.dynamics.flat_surfaces.quadratic_strata` especially:
- classification of connected components (from Kontsevich-Zorich)
- explicit permutation representative for each connected components (from Zorich)
- recognize the connected component of a given permutation

It also refactors the code for Abelian differentials.

Assignee: @videlec
