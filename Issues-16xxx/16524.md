Hi Nathann,

This is not clear (at least to me)

```
This is possible, because `PG(2,2)` is a subdesign in `PG(2,16)`; in a
cyclic `PG(2,16)` or `BIBD(273,17,1)` the points `\equiv 0 \pmod{39}`
form such a subdesign.
```

It would be better to have the (273,17,1) from the difference family constructor... I just did it and there is an extra check in the doc that it is actually a cyclic one: `u/vdelecroix/16524`.

Vincent

Ahahahah. It is "Julian Abel's truth". And as the constructions works... `:-)`

I just pushed it to the branch, but in the future I guess that we will remove this function as we add the patch of all DF found in the handbook. We will not create a function for each of them, and it will be a dictionary ... Anyway !

I mean, what is a PG? what do you mean by points `\equiv 0 \pmod{39}`?

Of course, it is on my todo list... but in the meantime let us continue the way we started!
