Some trivial substitutions are not done by solve:

```
sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: solve([y==exp(x),2*y-exp(x)==1],x,y)
[y == e^x, 2*y - e^x == 1]
```
and, as reported in http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23652/solve-equations-with-sinx/

```
sage: solve([y==sin(x),y+4*sin(x)==5],x,y)
[y == sin(x), y + 4*sin(x) == 5]
```

I think it is maxima which is unable to solve the equations and returns

```
%solve([y = sin(x), y + 4*sin(x) = 5],[x,y])
```
in this case. Sage converts this to list of solutions. Can we condition sage to return "Unable to solve" instead of returning the equations? while reporting this upstream.

solve([sin(x)==x,y^2==x],x,y)
Expected:
    [sin(x) == x, y^2 == x]

This solution doesn't fly. Presently:

```
sage: solve([x==5],[x])
[x == 5]
```
with this patch, it would return []. That's bad.

In general, I think it's bad to silently returning an empty list in a case where we know we failed to "solve" the system. An empty list can be interpreted as an inconsistent system of equations.

The original behaviour, returning the original system, indicates better a failure to solve than an empty solution list does. Therefore, I think that is preferable.

You could argue that returning the original system would be "invalid" output, because usually it means that the LH sides of the equations aren't the to-be-solved-for variables and/or the RH sides won't be free of them.

In that case, returning an error is a better solution.

I think the parsing that happens for `solution_dict=True` is definitely broken:

```
sage: solve([y == sin(x), y + 4*sin(x) == 5],[x,y],solution_dict=True)
[{y: sin(x)}, {y + 4*sin(x): 5}]
```
Compared with

```
sage: solve([x^2==5,y==6],[x,y],solution_dict=True)
[{y: 6, x: -sqrt(5)}, {y: 6, x: sqrt(5)}]
```
it's clearly very misleading output. So for `solution_dict=True` I think we have a good case for an error. Without it, I think the current output is misleading. But so is:

```
sage: solve(x-1,x)
[x == 1]
sage: solve([x-1],[x])
[x == 1]
sage: solve([x-1,y-1],[x,y])
[[x == 1, y == 1]]
sage: solve([x-1],[x],solution_dict=True)
TypeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object is not iterable
```
(we'd probably be better off if also in the single-variable case we'd also return list-of-lists etc.)

Beware of legacy, though. There might be users out there that have grown fond of this bad behaviour and somehow depend on it.

```

```
returns ` [x == 5]` as expected, the changed code gets executed only for system of equations.
Even for cases like 

``` 
sage: solve([x==5,y==2],x,y) 
```
maxima returns list of list as solution ` [This is the Trac macro *x == 5, y == 2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x == 5, y == 2-macro)`, so an empty set is not returned.
