One can read whether or not `tachyon_rt` is successful using the `verbose` option.  But it would be better to raise an error if rendering is unsuccessful.  

This would make doctests of tachyon plots more meaningful.  As it is, a doctest such as the one for [file://localhost/Applications/sage/src/doc/output/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.html#sage.plot.plot3d.tachyon.Tachyon.show Tachyon.show] can pass even if the `.dat` file is invalid and no image is produced.

An obvious fix would be to use the exit status of the `tachyon` command run from `os.system`.  Unfortunately I seemed to get exit status 0 even when the rendering was not successful.
