Users who want to solve a Semidefinite Program, using Sage, have to express the problem in a very restrictive standard form which is required by the solvers, rather than in a natural way that follows mathematical conventions. By creating an interface, similar to the MILP interface, the user should have a much easier time solving an SDP. We aim to create an SDP interface and a backend for CVXOPT, capable of solving simple SDP problems.

The original code of the interface, written by Ingólfur Eðvarðsson as a part of his MSc project,  can be found here 
https://github.com/ingolfured/sageproject/blob/master/src/sage/numerical/sdp.pyx
and the backend for cvxopt can be found here
https://github.com/ingolfured/sageproject/blob/master/src/sage/numerical/backends/cvxopt_sdp_backend.pyx

Added (slightly patched) to trac.

how does one deal with the differences in behaviour of `print()` in Python 2 vs 3?
(e.g. 

```
Python 2.7.10 (default, Nov 27 2015, 23:12:30) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("The answer is", 2*2)
('The answer is', 4)
```
instead of

```
Python 3.4.3 (default, Oct 14 2015, 20:28:29) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("The answer is", 2*2)
The answer is 4
```

Should I do `from `__future__` import print_function` whenever needed?

If you just want to rebuild all modules in `numerical` for example:

```
$ touch src/sage/numerical/*.pyx
$ ./sage -b
```

I would write this as

```
print("The answer is {}".format(2*2))
```

> Should I do `from `__future__` import print_function` whenever needed?

I don't even know if that works in doctests.
