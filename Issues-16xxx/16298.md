IIRC, at some point Sphinx was configured (in find_sage_dangling_links) so that it was possible to reference a class/function/... as soon as it was imported in the module being documented, without having to specify a full path. Apparently this is broken (see e.g. [1]).

The steps to reproduce should be to put in a file something like:

```
"""
...

See :class:`Partition_class`
"""

from sage.combinat.partition import Partition_class
```
and relaunch the doc building with --warn-links, and typically
`dangling_debug = True` in `src.doc.common.conf.py`.

Thanks, I'll try this out!

By the way, a random though (most likely not for this specific ticket): to resolve dandling links we could possibly use the logic behind `import_statement` to lookup stuff anywhere in the Sage library (as long as there is no ambiguity of course).

Cheers,
