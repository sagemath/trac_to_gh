There are many Vmt vectors coming, and while the data of a Vmt is only <20 integers, adding one in Sage takes a total of 40 lines of code, because of the doc and everything (aways copy/pasted).

With this patch, all the V(m,t) vectors are now contained in a dictionary, and adding one takes 3 lines (one for the integers, one for the bibliographical reference, and one for the index at the top of the file).

Beyond that it is fine... and could go to positive review.
