Hello Julian,

It seems that the only derivation you are testing is `y^2 - x`. I have nothing against the square root but it would be cool to have a bit more diversity in the doctests. And it would be cool to have somewhere non trivial examples of

```
sage: d(p+q) == d(p) + d(q)
True
sage: d(p*q) == d(p)*q + p*d(q)
True
```

In the `ALGORITHM` block, I would rather use `formula` instead of `algorithm`. And you mentioned the non-separable case that this ticket is not about.

Beyond documentation, everything looks good to me.

Vincent

I just fixed merge conflict with the current beta. A few comments

- In `function_field.py`:

```
It is also possible to work with function fields over an imperfect base field::

    sage: N.<u> = FunctionField(K)
```
Is `K` imperfect here? Isn't it a finite field?
- In `derivation` method:

```
        The general inseparable case is not implemented yet (see :trac:`16562`,
        :trac:`16564`.)`
```
A comment like this is better to be removed as it can soon become false (because of you :-)

No, `K` is a function field.

My experience with this has been that there is virtually no movement in function fields in Sage. So, I'd like to point people to places where they can help if they'd like.
