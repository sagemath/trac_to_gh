Some functions do not support rings/power-series*:

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: sqrt(1-4*x^2)
1 - 2*x^2 - 2*x^4 - 4*x^6 - 10*x^8 - 28*x^10 - 84*x^12 - 264*x^14 - 858*x^16 - 2860*x^18 + O(x^20)
sage: sin(1+4*x^2)
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring to Symbolic Ring
```
What is missing:
* `acos`, `acosh`, `asin`, `asinh`, `atan`, `atanh`, `cos`, `cosh`, `cotanh`, `dilog`, `gamma`, `intformal`, `lngamma`, `psi`, `sin`, `sinh`, `tan`, `tanh`


Keywords: function, series expansion

<a id='comment:1'></a>Similarly to my other comment on this, I don't know if we want `n(pi/4)` in here or not...

Also, the regular `SR` one works fine:

```
sage: ex.series(X,16)
(sin(1)) + (4*cos(1))*X^2 + (-8*sin(1))*X^4 + (-32/3*cos(1))*X^6 + (32/3*sin(1))*X^8 + (128/15*cos(1))*X^10 + (-256/45*sin(1))*X^12 + (-1024/315*cos(1))*X^14 + Order(X^16)
```
so I'm not sure why you referenced it, though I agree that the error you get for power series rings is not ideal.   Is there a way to either use SR for this (perhaps not "correct" for power series rings though?) or to get Pari to return a symbolic constant term?

```
sage: atan(4*X^2+1)
arctan(4*X^2 + 1)
sage: _.series(X,16)
(1/4*pi) + 2*X^2 + (-4)*X^4 + 16/3*X^6 + (-128/5)*X^10 + 256/3*X^12 + (-1024/7)*X^14 + Order(X^16)
```

Nothing missing there except the a.g.m., fortunately.

If I ask for "cosine power series" in Wolfram Alpha I get `1-x<sup>2/2+x</sup>4/24-x<sup>6/720+O(x</sup>7)`
