Some experimental work I started a while ago and have no time to continue right now.

Overall goal: make it easy both to benchmark sage against other tools and to track the performance of various subsystems across versions.

More or less done:
* Merge the various existing bits of benchmarking infrastructure.
* Port existing benchmarks to the unified framework.
Todo:
* Support creating benchmark suites.
* Support saving the results of a run (to compare several versions of sage or test the performance impact of a patch).
* Clean up and improve the existing benchmarks.
* ...
