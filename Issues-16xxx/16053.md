IPython 2.0 was released yesterday and contains quite some good stuff, in particular extended support for interactive widgets:

    ​http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/whatsnew/version2.0.html

I don't think it requires significant changes, as most relevant changes were made to update to IPython 1.2.1 on #14713.

We might consider bundling the dependencies needed to run the IPython notebook, see #16455.  That would give users two ways of having an online notebook.

Looking at the new 2.1 vs. our previous patch file, nearly all patches from the changeset have been applied upstream, except these three:
