IPython 2.0 was released yesterday and contains quite some good stuff, in particular extended support for interactive widgets:

    ​http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/whatsnew/version2.0.html

I don't think it requires significant changes, as most relevant changes were made to update to IPython 1.2.1 on #14713.

We might consider bundling the dependencies needed to run the IPython notebook, see #16455.  That would give users two ways of having an online notebook.
