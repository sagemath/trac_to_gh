I've also pushed another branch including an implem using the fq_nmod type at ``u/jpflori/flint_fq_nmod``.
Note that you'll need a FLINT version including my latest git commits from https://github.com/jpflori/flint2
At least now, FLINT seems to provide implementation faster than PARI for basic arithmetic over all ranges.

Doing the same thing for the fq_zech type should be as easy as for the fq_nmod type.
But there is so much code duplication that it should definitely be templated (that should already be done for the fq and fq_nmod types alone).
And not sure that the fq_zech type will be so useful as we have Givaro.

I'll do the templating stuff in a later tickets.
It really needs more thoughts than what I already did here, especially if I want to convert some other implementations to it.

This is really work in progress, so it's not really ready for review.
I thought very hard of templating but it was too much work for the time I had.
Note that the `pari_ffelt` class at least (and maybe the `pari_mod` one) is also very similar, so the templating/common base class should surely cover a wider area.

I'll fill in the dependencies asap.

First of all, I would prefer to move all changes to `libs/flint` to a different ticket.

If you want `distutils` magic, I would put it in every `.pxd` file which defines library functions (in practice, this is probably all of them except `types.pxd`).

Note #18837 which makes FLINT-related changes to `module_list.py`. The new ticket should probably depend on #18837.

Note though that the other types in `types.h` use the syntax with `pass`.
So I'm not sure if we should not modify all of them at once later.

Oh yes, the distutils part should definitely be done elsewhere.

Hello,

In `_element_constructor_` the following case should not happen

```
if isinstance(x, self.element_class) and x.parent() is self:
```
as if `parent(x)` is `self` then this is catched by the `__call__` of `Parent`. See line 1080-1083 of `parent.pyx`

```
        cdef R = parent_c(x) 
        cdef bint no_extra_args = len(args) == 0 and len(kwds) == 0 
        if R is self and no_extra_args: 
            return x
```

Instead of making `__nonzero__` relies on `is_unit` I would rather implement `__nonzero__` and call it in bot `is_unit` and `is_zero`. BTW for the latter this is what is in `Element.is_zero` by default, so you can even remove it. The reason why is that there is a special slot for `__nonzero__` in Python objects. So the fastest (Python) way to do things should be

```
if not my_element:
    XYZ
```
and not

```
if my_element.is_zero():
    XYZ
```

What are the status of the flint patches? Are there incorporated in flint-2.5? If that is so, it would make sense to first include it into Sage.

Vincent

Thanks, I'll have a look at both of these.
Not that the code is mainly cpoied/pasted from the PARI wrapper by Peter Bruin.
I'll also check the PARI wrapper.
Note the PARI wrapper is Python rather than Cython (as we have already have a cython "proxy" for PARI elements).

I guess so.
Integrating flint 2.5 first is a good idea anyway.
It will also allow to use the lacking in flint 2.4 fq_div function.
