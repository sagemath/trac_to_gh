```
*Problem*

Before this ticket, a `FiniteEnumeratedSet` could not be called on its
own elements whenever they were not `Element`'s:

```
sage: F = FiniteEnumeratedSet(["a", 1])
sage: F(1)
1
sage: F("a")
...
TypeError: Cannot convert str to sage.structure.element.Element
```

This prevented the use of `F(x)` as generic idiom to convert `x` into
`F` while checking that it's in `F`.

And indeed:

```
sage: TestSuite(F).run()
Failure in _test_an_element:
...
TypeError: Cannot convert str to sage.structure.element.Element
------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed: _test_an_element
```

*Analysis*

`Parent.__call__` enforces that `_element_constructor_` return an
`Element` (more precisely, it calls `_element_constructor_` through a
`DefaultConvertMap`, and any `Map` requires its results to be
instances of `Element`).

*Proposed solution*

Since `FiniteEnumeratedSets` is often a facade over plain Python
objects, this ticket works around this limitation by a custom
`FiniteEnumeratedSets.__call__` that calls directly
`_element_constructor_` whenever ``el`` is not an `Element`. Otherwise
`Parent.__call__` is called as usual.

*Limitation*

This workaround prevents conversions or coercions from facade parents
over plain Python objects. But it's already much better than before!
