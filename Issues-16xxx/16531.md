Right now we get this answer

```
sage: var('b, c')
(b, c)
sage: solve((c-1)*(b-1), [b,c])
[b == 1]
```

Which is wrong. In fact maxima can do it correctly:

```
sage: f = (b-1)*(c-1)
sage: f._maxima_()
(b-1)*(c-1)
sage: f._maxima_().solve([b,c])
[[b=1,c=%r3],[b=%r4,c=1]]
```


This patch solves it.


I ignored this comment:

```
        # Take care of cases like solve([x^2-1], [x]) for consistency with
        # multiple variable input in sage.symbolic.relation.solve().
        # There *should* be only one variable in the list, since it is
        # passed from sage.symbolic.relation.solve() and multiple variables
        # there don't call this function.
```

In sage/symbollic/expression.py because there is no such consistency issue:

```
sage: sage.symbolic.relation.solve(f,[b,c])
[[b == 1, c == r5], [b == r6, c == 1]]
```

This should solve the issue:
