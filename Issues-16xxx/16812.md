In #16670 the superiority of FLINT for creation of big Chebyshev-T-polynomials was confirmed. At T_10000 the speedup is already about 50x versus the present implementation. The issue is outsourced to this ticket.

I think the conditions `n>10 and is_PolynomialRing(P) and P.base() == ZZ and P.ngens() == 1 and x == P.gen()` should be generalized:

1. It should work for any `n`, at least negative `n` should be supported.

2. It should work for any ring of characteristic 0, not just `ZZ`.

3. Ideally, it should work for any kind of non-constant polynomial, not just generators of univariate polynomial rings.

Point 2 and 3 could be supported by first computing the polynomial in `ZZ[x]` and then substituting and/or changing the base ring as needed. I'm not saying this is needed on this ticket, but it would be the right thing to do.

Replying to [@fredrik-johansson](#comment:6):
> ...It should be enough to create a new Polynomial_integer_dense_flint instance and apply arith_chebyshev_t to its `.__poly`

Well, I tried that but needed to cast `polynomial.__poly` to `fmpz_poly_t` which is not possible in Cython because the type is an array. OTOH `cimport`ing the whole `class Polynomial_integer_dense_flint` declaration needs instances of the member functions defined. If I don't do that and just declare

```
cdef class Polynomial_integer_dense_flint(Polynomial):
    cdef fmpz_poly_t __poly
```
the function `libs.flint.arith.chebyshev_T` will finally compile but the result is not a `rings.polynomial.Polynomial_integer_dense_flint` and returning it and assigning it as such will bomb Sage.

I will now add a member function `chebyshev_T` to `rings...Polynomial_integer_dense_flint` to avoid all that hassle. My first forage into Cython which certainly presents itself as a fickle customer.

I have implemented this now and see no reason for the restriction in (2) to characteristic 0, as it seems to me that changing the base ring to, e.g., a finite field works nicely too.

In the process I uncovered at least two bugs.

I have removed the padics doctest for the moment because it was evaluated using the new FLINT code and the subsequent substitution was a bit too much. In this case the recursive evaulation is actually faster. But I have no idea at the moment when to select which algorithm, in order to not to fall in this trap.

I don't understand what you're trying to say. Fixing one doctest is not an excuse for breaking a different doctest.

On another note, the behaviour of the function up to this is unexpectedly complicated and not documented. Given integer n, if the second argument is symbolic then if `n<32` a formula is applied else the recursive algorithm. With this ticket, additionally polynomials are handled with FLINT (modulo the refinements discussed).

Now, I have a patch ready for an `algorithm` keyword (`flint`/`recursive`). Also, I want to remove that `n<32` bit together with the `eval_formula` method that really is no longer necessary now we have FLINT. It also leads to such inconsistencies as

```
            sage: var('n,x')
            (n, x)
            sage: chebyshev_T(5,x)
            16*x^5 - 20*x^3 + 5*x
            sage: chebyshev_T(64, x)
            2*(2*(2*(2*(2*(2*x^2 - 1)^2 - 1)^2 - 1)^2 - 1)^2 - 1)^2 - 1
```
which I would like to have either so or so, not both.

I think I propose to handle a symbolic argument exactly as a polynomial. No one expects such a nested result except if explicitly requested. It's also only faster because it's not expanded.

Do you have any objections?

I would also say there is a bug in mpmath because it cannot evaluate `chebyshev_T(10^6, 0.1)` without throwing a `mpmath.NoConvergence` while Sage's recursive algorithm is happy:

```
sage: chebyshev_T(10^6, 0.1, algorithm="recursive")
0.636384327171504
sage: timeit('chebyshev_T(10^6, 0.1, algorithm="recursive")')
625 loops, best of 3: 229 µs per loop
```
The result agrees with Wolfram to the 9th place which has `0.636384327247008190135495327481582817644932547700768253402752...`

Yes I have. There are users (like me) who want the possibility to switch between this representations, especially for large values of n.
So please still allow to call the method explicitely.

Typing

```
chebyshev_T(1000000,x)
```
in the old version gives a proper result in 7.52
The exact same input gives me full memory (8GB on my machine) and about 1GB swap + a frozen system in the new version.
Higher input gives a an error of flint (Memory allocation error)

Some switch would be nice. I guess the best measure would be the break even point on memory consumption.

Edit: I think a good point would be about order 5000-10000: It is reasonable from view of speed/memory and an explicit representation would be too cluttered anyway

That result may be proper for a symbolic `x` but the times are completely different for ring elements because expansion, which is avoided with symbolic `x`, happens automatically. This speed difference for polynomial ring elements actually is the reason for this ticket (see description).

I don't think Sage has to anticipate user memory size, I can go happily to 150.000 with 8GB:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('chebyshev_T(10^5,x)')
5 loops, best of 3: 454 ms per loop
sage: timeit('chebyshev_T(150000,x)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.01 s per loop
```
Who knows what will be in ten years? Note also that noone displays such results, and that's good because the output process takes near all memory and CPU, not FLINT.

Now, it might have been a bad idea by me to use FLINT on symbolic input but I thought users might appreciate unconvoluted polynomials as output. OTOH, they might get another motivation from this to use rings if they want straight output of polys. So I'll roll back the symbolic involvement, no limit is needed, and Bob's your uncle.

Than the solution is clear: Make a type check on the input type: If symbolic + higher order use recursion, if Polynomial Ring use flint

It's not about availabilty of RAM: no one wants that a Chebyshev polynomal consumes 1GB of RAM, and no one wants a freezing system, especially if there is a compact represention which only needs the logarithmical amount of time and memory.
And also: You don't have much use with an expanded symbolic Cheby poly of order 1e+5, only a cluttered screen, whereas the unexpanded style still is human readable.

Always consider: The main input method should provide some more or less smart default behaviour  

On another note: Encourage people to use polynomial ring by putting proper examples in the docstring

Recursive version works without abort


This kills my system:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: timeit('chebyshev_T(10^7,x)')

so it is not only the use of symbolic expressions
```

I propose the following switch mechanism: 
If the input is symbolic and deg > 10000 return the recursive result else use the regular algorithm

For other input the user has to take responsibility
Of course polynomials don't work good with the python recursion, flint does a better job.
For symbolic expressions for very high degree the recursion algorithm does a quite good job
