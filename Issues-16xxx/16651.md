The `SR.solve(..., to_poly_solve=True)` option does weird things:

```
sage: (x^7-x-1).solve(x, to_poly_solve=True)
[x == 1.11277569705, x == (0.617093477784 - 0.900864951949*I), x == (-0.809857800594 + 0.262869645851*I), x == (-0.363623519329 + 0.952561195261*I), x == (-240/913*I - 4157/5133), x == (-3775/3963*I - 2573/7076), x == (1354/1503*I + 2000/3241)]
```
Note that none of the solutions are actually Gaussian rationals. Maxima gives correct output:

```
maxima: load(to_poly_solve)$
Loadingmaxima-grobner$Revision:1.6$$Date:2009-06-0207:49:49$
maxima: to_poly_solve(x^7-x-1 = 0, x);

```
But our parsing of the output is totally off, starting at an iteration over the output list while modifying the output list.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I guess it might be next week before I find the time to have a closer look at this. And I don't know the code in this area, and have little experience with Maxima itself either. In any case, would I be correct to assume that `options='algexact:true'` is the critical point here?

Notes to self or any other reviewer:
* Omitting `multiplicities` in the condition makes sense, since `to_poly_solve=True, multiplicities=True` would already raise a `NotImplementedException` earlier on.
* Not messing around with `repr(x) in …` is certainly a good thing.
* The move from `Y = ….sage()` to `T = string_to_list_of_solutions(repr(s))` I don't understand yet. Need a closer look.
* The rationale behind `ignore_exceptions` I don't understand either yet.

A lot of this appears to be drive-by-fixes which make sense but are not immediately related to this bug here. Is that correct? Can you come up with doctests for the things these fix, if it's more than code simplification? For example I suppose that having one variable name as a substring of another might confuse this `repr(x)` hackery.

I would prefer changing the `while todo: ex = todo.pop()` back to `for eq in todo:`. As it stands now, the idiom suggests that you might be adding stuff to the list within the loop. This even had me concerned about infinite loops for a moment. But you don't do that, you simply iterate over the list.

There was a similar bug when solve originally found no solution, causing maxima `to_poly_solve` to be called twice. I fixed that, too.

The main doctest is the one you gave where some numerical solutions were incorrectly returned as rational.

<a id='comment:12'></a>> Cc-ing kcrisman since his commit [3278794](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=3278794b9a63e706b9ccef52435575a79f9a64ce) for #6642 introduced the use of `to_poly_solve=True` for `NumberFieldElement`, without any example of when this might be of use. Can you give an example of when this would be useful?


This was because of comment:7:ticket:6642.  Basically, the problem is that Barton's `to_poly_solve` stuff depends on `algsys` which does not guarantee exact solutions, though it very often gives them.  But in order for that doctest to work we made that change, as you can see by reading the full set of comments on the ticket.

But I'm very happy if someone cleans up whatever code I contributed so long ago - I wrangled over that in various ways to make sure that if somebody really wanted a solution they would get one, but it was certainly just to get things done.  Thanks for looking into it!

Hmm, that is most likely true, since the point is to solve things that are not polynomials (you convert them to polys), though I'm not 100% sure - I would want to confirm that with Barton.
