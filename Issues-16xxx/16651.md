The `SR.solve(..., to_poly_solve=True)` option does weird things:

```
sage: (x^7-x-1).solve(x, to_poly_solve=True)
[x == 1.11277569705, x == (0.617093477784 - 0.900864951949*I), x == (-0.809857800594 + 0.262869645851*I), x == (-0.363623519329 + 0.952561195261*I), x == (-240/913*I - 4157/5133), x == (-3775/3963*I - 2573/7076), x == (1354/1503*I + 2000/3241)]
```
Note that none of the solutions are actually Gaussian rationals. Maxima gives correct output:

```
maxima: load(to_poly_solve)$
Loadingmaxima-grobner$Revision:1.6$$Date:2009-06-0207:49:49$
maxima: to_poly_solve(x^7-x-1 = 0, x);    
%union([x=1.11277569704536],[x=-0.9525611952610316*%i-0.36362351932918313],[x=0.6170934777839656-0.9008649519489099*%i],[x=-0.2628696458512362*%i-0.8098578005941353],[x=0.2628696458512362*%i-0.8098578005941353],[x=0.9008649519489099*%i+0.6170934777839656],[x=0.9525611952610316*%i-0.36362351932918313])
```
But our parsing of the output is totally off, starting at an iteration over the output list while modifying the output list.

I guess it might be next week before I find the time to have a closer look at this. And I don't know the code in this area, and have little experience with Maxima itself either. In any case, would I be correct to assume that `options='algexact:true'` is the critical point here?

Notes to self or any other reviewer:
* Omitting `multiplicities` in the condition makes sense, since `to_poly_solve=True, multiplicities=True` would already raise a `NotImplementedException` earlier on.
* Not messing around with `repr(x) in …` is certainly a good thing.
* The move from `Y = ….sage()` to `T = string_to_list_of_solutions(repr(s))` I don't understand yet. Need a closer look.
* The rationale behind `ignore_exceptions` I don't understand either yet.

A lot of this appears to be drive-by-fixes which make sense but are not immediately related to this bug here. Is that correct? Can you come up with doctests for the things these fix, if it's more than code simplification? For example I suppose that having one variable name as a substring of another might confuse this `repr(x)` hackery.

I would prefer changing the `while todo: ex = todo.pop()` back to `for eq in todo:`. As it stands now, the idiom suggests that you might be adding stuff to the list within the loop.

There was a similar bug when solve originally found no solution, causing maxima `to_poly_solve` to be called twice. I fixed that, too.

The main doctest is the one you gave where some numerical solutions were incorrectly returned as rational.

Hmm, that is most likely true, since the point is to solve things that are not polynomials (you convert them to polys), though I'm not 100% sure - I would want to confirm that with Barton.

The only thing like that I could find in the documentation was

```
to_poly_solve(x^(2*a) + x^a + 1,x);
```
but that's for a generic variable `a`.
