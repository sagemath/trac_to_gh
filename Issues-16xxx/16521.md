Currently there is no way to find out whether a field is perfect, i.e., whether its characteristic is zero or whether every element has a p-th root. This is sometimes necessary to guarantee the correctness of certain algorithms, e.g., #16518.

I took the liberty to add a missing copyright header to one file. I created the header from all contributors (according to `git log`) with at least 10 lines of code. This does of course not have to be part of this ticket if the reviewer does not like it.

I can not reproduce this problem and also the patchbot does not see it.

`WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.` does not make sense to me in `function_field.py` since I did not add/modify a bullet list there.

Therefore, I set this back to `positive_review`. I hope that I have not missed anything.
