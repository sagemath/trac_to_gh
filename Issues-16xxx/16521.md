I can not reproduce this problem and also the patchbot does not see it.

`WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.` does not make sense to me in `function_field.py` since I did not add/modify a bullet list there.

Therefore, I set this back to `positive_review`. I hope that I have not missed anything.
