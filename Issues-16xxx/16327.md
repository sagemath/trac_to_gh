```
Attached is a new bash script to clean up `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream` that gets cluttered with stale packages.

Usage:

```
$ sage -sh
$ sage-clean-upstream --pretend    # to show what it would remove
$ sage-clean-upstream              # to actually remove old tar balls
```

If there is interest, then I will try to convert it to a script within sage, which could be called using `sage --clean-upstream`.

The attached log file shows what it would delete on my system, and what files are currently present in `upstream/` on my system.

One problem is that currently not all packages have proper versions / "fullnames", cf. `sage-list-packages`.  I.e., e.g. `ver` may be empty and then `pkg_ver="$pkg-$ver"` doesn't work.

Well, sage-list-packages gives very old versions. I don't see how that is reliable.

```
~» sage -sh
~» sage-list-packages standard
...
sage-5.13 ............................... not installed
sage_root-5.13 .......................... not installed
sage_scripts-5.13 ....................... not installed
sagenb-0.10.7.2 ......................... installed version: 0.10.8.2
...
```

Do you have an example where a package does not have version? I can not find any in my list; but I haven't tried the optional or experimental packages, of course.

```
~/tmp/sage/build/pkgs» for p in *; do
 if [[ ! -f "$p"/package-version.txt ]]; then
  continue
 fi
 if [[ -z "$(<$p/package-version.txt)" ]]; then
  echo "$p has empty version"
 fi
done
~/tmp/sage/build/pkgs»
```

Finally, the script skips those packages that do not have versions in their tarball. In those cases, the `tarball` variable in the inner for loop happens to be of the form `.../upstream/package-*`. The script therefore checks whether the variable `tarball` is actually a file in `upstream/` or not.

What's the definition of a stale package? You can clean the entire `upstream` directory with

```

But as someone else pointed out, there's no easy way to tell which of those are needed by some branch.

> What's the definition of a stale package?

Wow, this ticket is 7 years old now! I am not actively involved nowadays, and I will have to read my script carefully to understand how I had implemented it so many years ago!

Regarding stale package, below is an example - once the newer package is installed we do not have a need for the older one:

```
...tallations/sage/upstream » ls -1 ecl*
ecl-20.4.24.tgz
ecl-21.2.1.tgz
```

> But as someone else pointed out, there's no easy way to tell which of those are needed by some branch.

This is true. There is no easy way out of this. If a developer switches branches between master and some other development branch where a *lot* of packages have changed then it is really a choice whether the developer wants to keep on running a script like this every other day. Recompiling packages will re-download the files at the worst.

This script was not supposed to be run very frequently. It was supposed to help clean up upstream directory by identifying packages that are no longer needed by the current version of sage.
