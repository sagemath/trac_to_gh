From [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23223/projection_direction-broken-for-polytopes/), the two following should be different, but aren't.

```
poly = polytopes.twenty_four_cell()
poly.show()

poly.show(projection_direction=[2,5,11,17])
```

Yes, there was some confusion in my mind earlier...

As to your comment on the ask.sagemath question, unfortunately the following is still in [the documentation](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/plot.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.plot.render_4d).

```
sage: poly = polytopes.twenty_four_cell()
sage: poly
A 4-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull of 24 vertices
sage: poly.show()
sage: poly.show(projection_direction=[2,5,11,17])
```
So if that is not supposed to be used in that way, it was missed whenever those methods changed.  There is also no deprecation information given.
