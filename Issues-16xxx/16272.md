The tickets #15310 and #16227 introduce a nice `availability` keywords to the function `transversal_design`. With `availability=True` the return value is the answer to the question "Does Sage know how to build a TD(k,n)"? Using `Unknown` from `sage.misc.unknown` we can turn the question into "Do we know mathematically that a TD(k,n) exist?" whose answer would be:
- `True` if Sage knows how to do it
- `Unknwon` if neither Sage nor mathematics can help
- `False` if we know mathematically that such construction does not exist

As the semantic changes, we will also turn the keyword `availability` into `existence` (or maybe have both).

In the same ticket, we will include some of the known non existence of transversal designs:
- The [Bruck Ryser Chowla Theorm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem) gives the non-existence of many TD(n+1,n)
- C. Lam in Lam, "The Search for a Finite Projective Plane of Order 10" (1991) proved that TD(11,10) cannot exist

And we might see later

- there is some work (?) that shows that if $k$ is large enough then the existence of TD(k,n) implies the existence of TD(n+1,n) and so the non-existence results can percolate downwards in k

In case "Unkown" did you mean that Sage does not know how to do it (as currently implemented) but possibly Mathematics knows the answer?  "Unknown" should ideally mean that mathematics does not know the answer but Sage development is likely to lag behind mathematics and I don't want users to think that if Sage does not know the answer that this implies that mathematics does not know the answer.  I think this is all what you meant but the word "nor" confused me.

The Bruck-Ryser-Chowla Theorem (from Theorem 2.13 in Stinson's Book) shows that if $n \equiv 1,2 \bmod 4$
and there exists a prime $p \equiv 3 \bmod 4$ such that the largest power of $p$ that divides $n$ is odd.  Then a TD$(n+1,n)$ does not exist.

A reference for the non existence of TD$(11,10)$ is 

```
@article {MR1018454,
    AUTHOR = {Lam, C. W. H. and Thiel, L. and Swiercz, S.},
     TITLE = {The nonexistence of finite projective planes of order {$10$}},
   JOURNAL = {Canad. J. Math.},
  FJOURNAL = {Canadian Journal of Mathematics. Journal Canadien de Math\'ematiques},
    VOLUME = {41},
      YEAR = {1989},
    NUMBER = {6},
     PAGES = {1117--1123},
      ISSN = {0008-414X},
     CODEN = {CJMAAB},
   MRCLASS = {51E15 (51-04)},
  MRNUMBER = {1018454 (90j:51008)},
MRREVIEWER = {J. C. Fisher},
       DOI = {10.4153/CJM-1989-049-4},
}
```


For the results I mentioned about sufficiently high $k$ implying TD$(n+1,n)$ exists, I will have to dig up the papers by Metz and review them to remember exactly how this works.

Yo !

> In case "Unkown" did you mean that Sage does not know how to do it (as currently implemented) but possibly Mathematics knows the answer? 


The parameter will be called "existence". When you type `designs.transversal_design(k,n,existence=True)`

it will answer
1) `True` meaning "Sage can build it"
2) `Unknown` meaning "Sage can't build it, but it may exist"
3) `False` meaning "it does not exist"

Thus there is nothing there to mean "Mathematics knows it exists but Sage does not know how to build it". THouuuuuuugh if you know of something like that, the only responsible way to solve the problem is to implement the  mathematical result `:-P`

> "Unknown" should ideally mean that mathematics does not know the answer but Sage development is likely to lag behind mathematics and I don't want users to think that if Sage does not know the answer that this implies that mathematics does not know the answer.  I think this is all what you meant but the word "nor" confused me.


Well, the word "unknown" means "Sage has no idea" `^^;`

Okayyyyyyyyy !

Because some characters that you used are interpreted as typographic instructions. Wrap what you want to say with `{{{` and `}}}` to avoid that. I  edited your comment above, so it looks fine now `;-)`

HMmm... Well, to me this is similar to the "construction path" feature. You know, the feature to tell you how to prove formally that a design exists with theorems ? There you want a "formal proof" that it cannot be done.

The thing is that right now we have no recursive proof of non-existence... But I still believe that it is too early to implement stuff like that.

Hello,

Here it comes!

Ok. I mainly did two things
   - implement my own `projective_space_as_OA` inside `orthogonal_arrays.py`. This might sound weird but the current implementation of `ProjectiveSpaceDesign` is slow and scarry me (I plan to clean it soon in a ticket).
   - implement a beautiful `TD_existence` (I do not like the name, so I aks for suggestions here):

   ```
   sage: from sage.combinat.designs.orthogonal_arrays import TD_existence
   sage: TD_existence(6)
   TD(k,6)
    exist            for k in [ 2, 3]
    unknown to exist for k in [ 4, 6]
    not exist        for k in [ 7,+infini]
   ```

I also correct some of the errors raised to get mainly `EmptySetError` and `NotImplementedError`.

Vincent

Get this thing out of here until a proper interface design is found. A function like that should RETURN values, not print stuff. Plus we have almost no negative result to advertise for the moment. Plus how the hell is an user going to find that ? We write Sage code here, not our own scripts !!!

If such a function is to ever be implemented, it will return a pair "lower bound, upper bound". The only interesting data in your three lines are TWO NUMBERS, and wrapping them in intervals for nothing, adding a 2 there and an infinity there looks fancy, but once more we work on a library here, not on your own code.

By the way... When we will have merged all constructions, there is a doctest that I would like to include in the doc, and it may partly do what you built this "TD_existence" thing for.

This is the table that I am trying to copy :
http://books.google.fr/books?id=S9FA9rq1BgoC&lpg=PA175&ots=Do3xYTkMox&dq=%22mols%22%20of%20side%20%3C%2010000&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q=%22mols%22%20of%20side%20%3C%2010000&f=false

It is somehow "the reference". It gives you the maximum number of MOLS that are known to exist for a given order.

aaaaaaaand I have had  the following code for a while to see where I was going:

```
print "      ",
for i in range(20):
    print str(i)+" "*(4-len(str(i))),
print ""
print " "*4+"_"*20*5+"__"

for i in range(20*10):
    if i%20==0:
        print ""
        print str(i)+" "*(4-len(str(i)))+"| ",
    if i < 2:
        k = 1
    else:
        for k in range(i+1):
            if not designs.mutually_orthogonal_latin_squares(i,k,availability=True):
                break
    k = str(k-1)
    print k+" "*(4-len(k)),
```

This function is not meant to be called by users of course, I thought I would just make it a private function and call it just once, in a "# long" doctest. Here is what it produces, with #16241 (and all its dependencies) applied.

```

It will be a nice way to advertise what Sage can do for TD/OA/MOLS `:-P`

Hi Nathann,

You are right. I moved `TD_existence` as a doctest in `transversal_design` and now `projective_plane_as_OA` belongs to the module `block_design`.

The function `projective_plane_as_OA` is not similar to `ProjectivePlaneDesign` as it returns an  OA (moreover, possibly not a complete OA(n+1,n,2)).

Is it better like that?

Yo !

> You are right. I moved `TD_existence` as a doctest in `transversal_design` and now `projective_plane_as_OA` belongs to the module `block_design`.


Okay, I really think that you are wrongly assuming that it is "always cool" to add tests, but I always check the long tests when I work on a file and adding "a minute there, a minute there" really is painful.

Let's talk about the code : you screamed when I removed the feature "give me the largest k possible" from the MOLS. It is now time to add it. To add the feature in all 3 constructors, because it costs absolutely nothing

```
def OA(...):
   if k is None:
       all(OA(k+1,n,existence=True) for k in range(2,n+4))
       return k
```
And for all others

```
def TD(...):
    if k is None:
        k = OA(None, n,existence = True)
```

Then your doctest will be lighter and we will have the feature back. I can do it if you don't want to.

Also : would you mind not constructing the design for values of k which are smaller than the best possible ? Really, please don't make doctests too long. It takes times when you work on code, and you really over-check stuff. Remember that all results are checked before being returned anyway, so really this is a waste of (developer) time.

If you need to rewrite a different version of ProjectivePlaneDesign becaause it is to slow, is it safe to assume that ProjectivePlaneDesign should be changed ?

It does not make any sense to implement the same thing twice, Vincent, really. Of course if you have to call the ProjectivePlaneDesign you may have some conversion to do, but is that really a problem ? We must not implement this thing twice, really ....

Sounds good to me. I will do it and simplify the doctests accordingly.

It is not only about conversion. ProjectivePlaneDesign is buggy: there is crazy argument "type" which makes specification a bit more complicated:
- if type is None: do what you know is the best and return **a** projective plane
- if type is something: do whatever the construction tells you and return **the** corresponding projective plane

Now if you incorporate the `who_asked` feature. It becomes crazy! I feel like `type` and `who_asked` are rather incompatible. To my mind, we should simply remove `ProjectivePlaneDesign` and have different functions (which raise only `ValueError` on bad entries) for each kind of projective planes we know about.

What? I only moved **your** code from `orthogonal_array` to `projective_plane_as_OA`? Just kidding :-P

Arrrrrrggggghhhhhhh. The `k` comes before the `n`. So there is no way to make `k` optional without making `n` optional... do you feel like having something like

```
def transversal_design(k,n=None):
    if n is None:
        n = k
        k = best_possible(n)
    ...
```

This ticket is no place to fix that.

I can not use the current ProjectivePlaneDesign... here are the timings:

```
sage: %timeit designs.ProjectivePlaneDesign(9)
1 loops, best of 3: 2.63 s per loop
sage: %timeit designs.ProjectivePlaneDesign(16)  # WTF?
1 loops, best of 3: 42.3 s per loop
```
2 secs are reasonable but 42 secs are not and I do not want to go further. Now with the straigthforward one I used it takes less than 1 sec:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.designs.block_design import projective_plane_as_OA
sage: %timeit projective_plane_as_OA(9)
100 loops, best of 3: 5.95 ms per loop
sage: %timeit projective_plane_as_OA(16)
10 loops, best of 3: 39.5 ms per loop
```

I do not want either to rewrite the whole ProjectivePlaneDesign as it is not the purpose of that ticket. So please find a reasonable solution.

Hi Nathann,

Projective planes from #16281 is merged and now the code is shorter/cleaner.

There is no real check that a projective plane is valid as the ouptut of the function `projective_plane`... but that is not a real problem.

Okay Vincent. Unless you know a way for me to see exactly what you implemented which is not already in the other tickets, could you :

1) GO back to the history before the merge

2) Do the merge and only the merge

3) Implement stuff

Otherwise I just can't see what you did.

Hi,

Before the merge, there **was** a `who_asked` argument in `projective_plane_as_OA`. Now it is an argument of `projective_plane`. In the second part of the merge I only fix some typo and doctests.

Perhaps I should go much before in history and then do the merge... let me try.

I do not care too much about calling twice the function. My main trouble was that in `OA` with parameters `n,k=n+1,t=2` we have equivalence with projective planes. So we need to let the projective plane do what it has to do (even if the answer is Unknown). Whereas for general `n,k,t=2` we might have something better but it still worth it to ask about a projective plane... If you have an idea to make it neat I let it to you.

Cool (Note that the doc problem is fixed).

We leave the idea of having an optional `k=None`? Might be an independent ticket anyway.

Cool. Then I changed the code  to have a nice "if/elif" structure. In some very specific cases the projective plane function is called three times, but

1) This is only when the answer has been found, so it does not happens often per call

2) A tricky replacement is possible too, as 

```
    elif (t == 2 and
          (projective_plane(n, existence=True) or
           (k == n+1 and projective_plane(n, existence=True) is False))):
```

is equivalent to:

```
    elif (t == 2 and
          (projective_plane(n, existence=True) in (True,k<n+1))):
```

This being said the code of these things compared to the cost of building the actual array ...

> We leave the idea of having an optional `k=None`? Might be an independent ticket anyway.


Yep, let's close this one and get #16277 in. I will merge it in a second.
