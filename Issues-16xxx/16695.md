The file `src/sage/symbolic/assumptions.py` was not part of the reference manual; therefore, the documentation of the global function `assume()` etc. was not in the reference manual.

See the discussion at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pb5C1xPTU7c .

This simple patch adds it to `reference/calculus`.

**CC:**  @dkrenn @kcrisman

**Keywords:** documentation, assumptions, assume
