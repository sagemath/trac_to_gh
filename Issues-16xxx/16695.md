Keywords: dot2tex

If `preview.sty` is missing and `dot2tex` is installed, then

```
view(Poset( ([1,2,3,4,5],[[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[2,5],[4,5]])),tightpage=True)
```

gives exception. For example

```
view(graphs.PetersenGraph(), tightpage=True)
```

works as it should, i.e. says what LaTeX package user is missing. With `preview.sty` installed both examples works.

In 6.6.rc2 this happens also with just `view(Poset({1:[2]}))`.

This is now at least consistent, i.e. the output does not depend on poset/graph. Hence I think this one can be closed.
