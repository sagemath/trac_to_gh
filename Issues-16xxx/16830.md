That looks like the category machinery is not cooperating with coercion properly. The scalar multiplication should be there according to the categories:

```
sage: parent(phi).categories()
[Category of hom sets in Category of modules over Finite Field of size 7,
 Category of vector spaces over Finite Field of size 7,
 Category of modules over Finite Field of size 7,
 Category of bimodules over Finite Field of size 7 on the left and Finite Field of size 7 on the right,
 Category of right modules over Finite Field of size 7,
 Category of left modules over Finite Field of size 7,
 Category of commutative additive groups,
 Category of additive groups,
 Category of additive inverse additive unital additive magmas,
 Category of commutative additive monoids,
 Category of additive monoids,
 Category of additive unital additive magmas,
 Category of commutative additive semigroups,
 Category of additive commutative additive magmas,
 Category of additive semigroups,
 Category of additive magmas,
 Category of hom sets in Category of sets,
 Category of hom sets in Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of hom sets in Category of objects,
 Category of sets,
 Category of sets with partial maps,
 Category of objects]
```
By the way, going up the inheritance in the code:

```
sage: sage.modules.vector_space_homspace.VectorSpaceHomspace.mro()
[sage.modules.vector_space_homspace.VectorSpaceHomspace,
 sage.modules.free_module_homspace.FreeModuleHomspace,
 sage.categories.homset.HomsetWithBase,
 sage.categories.homset.Homset,
 sage.structure.parent.Set_generic,
 sage.structure.parent.Parent,
 sage.structure.category_object.CategoryObject,
 sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject,
 object]
```
and reading the code, it's completely unclear how `parent(phi)` got those module categories attached to it. It would have to happen somewhere in `sage.modules.vector_space_homspace.VectorSpaceHomspace, sage.modules.free_module_homspace.FreeModuleHomspace` but none of those classes have an `__init__`.

Well, categories are doing nothing here but stating the math. This
issue is really about the concrete class VectorSpaceMorphism for
morphisms defined by a matrix which is responsible for implementing
multiplication by scalars, and apparently does not.

The setting of the category for a homset is handled generically in
Homset.__init__.

Having a brief look at the code, `MatrixMorphism` implements a `__mul__` method to handle multiplication by other types of morphisms. But this prevents the coercion model to take over when needed!

Instead, `MatrixMorphism` should implement `_mul_` for basic multiplication, handle multiplication by other types of morphisms by coercion, and implement `_lmul_` or `_acted_upon` (I never quite remember from the top of my head which one should be used in this situation) to implement multiplication by scalar).
