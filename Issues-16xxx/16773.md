Implement functionality to bound from above the analytic rank of a rational elliptic curve. This uses the zero sum method as described in [http://msp.org/obs/2013/1-1/obs-v1-n1-p07-s.pdf](http://msp.org/obs/2013/1-1/obs-v1-n1-p07-s.pdf). Because this avoids computing with the curve's L-function directly, it is often faster than traditional analytic rank techniques.

The enhancement also includes functionality to compute more general zero sums for an elliptic curve L-function, as well as computing with the logarithmic derivative. The elliptic_curves object in Sage has also been modified to contain examples of elliptic curves up to rank 28. To this end the elliptic_curves spkg has been updated to version 0.8. The zipped data file for the spkg can be obtained at

As for that one random error in ell_rational_field.py, I've tracked it to `@`parallel code being executed when ncpus is large (>8). Given that it seems to run fine on some systems but not others, my guess is that it's probably an issue somewhere in the `@`parallel framework as opposed to the new code in this patch.

Nevertheless, I've reworked the doctest in any case -- a test using that many CPUs is excessive, and it was still taking longer than the suggested ~5 seconds. It now uses smaller parameters and only calls for 2 processors. This should hopefully make it run without issue on any system.

All doctests pass on SMC architecture. I'll also run the full test suite on a different system just to be sure.

My question was not a matter of "general discussion" but the very precise point that this ticket is 
reimplementing the dilog function instead of using the existing one. If you think that one
should not care for such a code duplication, then of course let us do whatever we want, without
