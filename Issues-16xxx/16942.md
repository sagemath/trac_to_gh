Let E be an EllipticCurve.  

We can not yet construct the graph of the j-invariants of the curves which are isogenous to E. This ticket fills this little gap.

I have made a cosmetic cleanup of the branch.

But it does not work, test do not pass for me. The doc should say (and the tests should also care) that this is optional, because requiring a database.

It seems that `db_modular_polynomials` is not available using
 `sage -i db_modular_polynomials`

I think it would be good to explain how to install this database in the doc, if there is some other way.

And `AttributeError` should be `ValueError` instead.

And `.. note::` should be `.. NOTE::`

I am not really the man to give a positive review, given that I am not an expert.

There seems to remain an issue about directed graph versus undirected graph..

Yes, and it should also be possible to get the actual elliptic curves in the isogeny class, not just their *j*-invariants (see [comment:17](#comment%3A17)).  It would probably be a good idea to look at the method `EllipticCurve_rational_field.isogeny_graph()` and try to keep the interface consistent with that.

Hello. Thanks @fchapoton for taking the time to rebase this.

But, honestly, shouldn't we say this code is not going to be merged?

I am sure there is a lot of interest right now in isogeny graphs over finite fields (because post-quantum crypto, you know), and it would be good if Sage offered some functionality. However this code hardly covers all interesting cases, and it has design issues.

If we could agree on the correct API, I'd be happy to rewrite the code. Let me summarize the issues:

- A function on Fq which outputs a graph labeled by j-invariants, VS a function on elliptic curves which outputs a graph labeled by curves. My opinion is that both are useful, so we could implement both.

- Undirected VS directed graph. The problem is that, although generically these graphs are simple undirected graphs, there are lots of pathological cases:
  - Self-loops,
  - multi-edges,
  - j-invariants 0 and 1728 are especially nasty (same dual for many isogenies).

- The method: modular polynomials VS `isogenies_prime_degree()`. As far as I recall, `isogenies_prime_degree()` factors the division polynomial. It is more expensive, but it requires no optional database (and can in principle cover any degree, although it becomes unrealistic when degrees get large).

Let me add one more issue: fool-proofness. The size of these graphs is polynomial in the field **SIZE**! I'm sure a lot of beginners would create a cyptographic-size finite field and then ask for an isogeny graph. This would of course take forever. Maybe we could print a warning when the expected size is too large.

@JohnCremona, @pjbruin, comments?
