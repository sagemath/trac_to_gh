a "Hypergraph" class was introduced in #14712, but there also exists `IncidenceStructure` in `sage/combinat/designs` as well as `set_system` in `sage/matroids`.

We should really start to all work together on the same class, so for now let's deprecate Hypergraph in favor of `IncidenceStructure`.

1) The only interesting thing that `Hypergraph` can do is plot a hypergraph, and `IncidenceStructure` has no such feature.

2) Right now `set_system` claims to be only for internal use, so we cannot use it right now as a replacement right now.

I'm not sure one should `deprecate` one in favour of the other. They are different names of the same object, as far as I am concerned. (IMHO "hypergraph" is a more common name, and there has been a lot of work done in this terminology, especially in TCS people prefer this terminology).

I'd rather rename `IncidenceStructure`. There is more Sage-dependent hypergraph code around, some of it quite deep,
cf. http://flagmatic.org/
It's not using Sage's own hypergraph code as it wasn't around at the time this was written, but still...

Well if they don't use it, what exactly is the problem ? In the end `Hypergraph` and `IncidenceStructure` will be the same object anyway.

I personally do not care about backward compatibility, but I know the workflow :

1) I don't care

2) Somebody writes to Sage-devel

3) Everybody throws me stones

4) Deprecation warning

No need to deprecate anything at all. IMHO...

Right now we have a Hypergraph class and an IncidenceStructure class. In the future it would be good to have only one, i.e. `Hypergraph` and `IncidenceStructure` should be the same class. I am trying to do this by telling users to stop using `Hypergraph` for a while and use `IncidenceStructure` instead, and after one year of deprecation `Hypergraph` will be an alias for `IncidenceStructure`.

How could we do that without deprecation ?

if you just put everything that we have in `Hypergraph` into `IncidenceStructure`, and then do 

```
   Hypergraph = IncidenceStructure
```
you only add more methods to `Hypergraph` and to `IncidenceStructure`. Nothing is removed. How can it break users' code? Why would one need to deprecate?

The input of `Hypergraph` is not the same as `IncidenceStructure`. In `IncidenceStructure` you need to provide the sets of points, which you do not need to do in `Hypergraph`.

Honestly, I am pretty sure that nobody uses this `Hypergraph` class. But I am tired of fighting with everybody for this kind of stuff.

Yes, to draw them - I had to construct a bunch of hypergraphs based on pictures and it was a nice check to see that everything was done correctly. They were quite small and simple, so your code worked OK for me.

It is true. It can be used to lists all hypergraphs through `hypergraphs.nauty`. I do not think that it is a problem.

There is a "hypergraph" entry in the "Graph theory" section. We cannot really afford to add a "Hypergraph" entry just near the "graph theory" section given the very small amount of code that we ship `O_o`

I think `Incidence structures (i.e. hypergraphs, i.e. set systems)` should be in the top-level list, next to graph theory and matroids. (and no Hypergraphs in Graphs).

And `HyperGraphGenerators` should become `HypergraphGenerators` and go to this section (of the manual, as well as of the code).

Well, we disagree there. To me this hypergraph stuff is nothing more than a gadget for the moment, Vincent just fixed a lot of things there in his last patch and many methods will just raise deprecation warnings for a year. Plus there is so little code that putting it on the same level as graphs... `O_o`

I mean, even LP is buried in "numerical" and it is ten times more used and more useful, and combinatorial designs contain a thousand objects that only Sage can build, and it is buried too...

Plus it would mean that the code exists in sage/combinat/designs and the doc actually hints that it should be sage/hypergraphs ?

Sorry Dima but I think that it is too early for that.
