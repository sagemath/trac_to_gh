```
a "Hypergraph" class was introduced in #14712, but there also exists `IncidenceStructure` in `sage/combinat/designs` as well as `set_system` in `sage/matroids`.

We should really start to all work together on the same class, so for now let's deprecate Hypergraph in favor of `IncidenceStructure`.

1) The only interesting thing that `Hypergraph` can do is plot a hypergraph, and `IncidenceStructure` has no such feature.

2) Right now `set_system` claims to be only for internal use, so we cannot use it right now as a replacement right now.

Hmmm... I prefer Hypergraph too, but the most interesting code is in `IncidenceStructure`. What I am implementing right now does the following :

1) move the features of `Hypergraph` that are not available in `IncidenceStructure` into `IncidenceStructure`

2) add a deprecation warning saying that in the future Hypergraph will be an alias for `IncidenceStructure` but that the input/output are different so that people should use `IncidenceStructure` directly in the meantime

I made a mistake with git commands, and as a result all files were "touched" and I recompile Sage right now... In the meantime I will make sure that all doctests that used to work on `Hypergraph` still work, and I will update the doc/doctests of their new `IncidenceStructure` counterparts.

I have nothing against changing the name of `IncidenceStructure` by the way. Vincent wrote a patch recently (#16553) which showed that it had been written with "Block Design" in mind, which is not what "incidence structure" means. What do you think ? Anyway, if we eventually merge the two we will have to change the input of one for the inputs of the other, so this way is as good as any.

Besides, I suspect that nobody besides me knows that Sage has a Hypergraph class. I began this patch because of some emails with Stefan, which made us notice that we are already doing the same work twice in matroids and designs when it comes to hypergraphs.

I'd rather rename `IncidenceStructure`. There is more Sage-dependent hypergraph code around, some of it quite deep,
cf. http://flagmatic.org/
It's not using Sage's own hypergraph code as it wasn't around at the time this was written, but still...

Well if they don't use it, what exactly is the problem ? In the end `Hypergraph` and `IncidenceStructure` will be the same object anyway.

I personally do not care about backward compatibility, but I know the workflow :

1) I don't care

2) Somebody writes to Sage-devel

3) Everybody throws me stones

4) Deprecation warning

if you just put everything that we have in `Hypergraph` into `IncidenceStructure`, and then do 

```
   Hypergraph = IncidenceStructure
```
you only add more methods to `Hypergraph` and to `IncidenceStructure`. Nothing is removed. How can it break users' code? Why would one need to deprecate?

The input of `Hypergraph` is not the same as `IncidenceStructure`. In `IncidenceStructure` you need to provide the sets of points, which you do not need to do in `Hypergraph`.

Honestly, I am pretty sure that nobody uses this `Hypergraph` class. But I am tired of fighting with everybody for this kind of stuff.

Yes, to draw them - I had to construct a bunch of hypergraphs based on pictures and it was a nice check to see that everything was done correctly. They were quite small and simple, so your code worked OK for me.

I think `Incidence structures (i.e. hypergraphs, i.e. set systems)` should be in the top-level list, next to graph theory and matroids. (and no Hypergraphs in Graphs).

And `HyperGraphGenerators` should become `HypergraphGenerators` and go to this section (of the manual, as well as of the code).

I mean, even LP is buried in "numerical" and it is ten times more used and more useful, and combinatorial designs contain a thousand objects that only Sage can build, and it is buried too...

Plus it would mean that the code exists in sage/combinat/designs and the doc actually hints that it should be sage/hypergraphs ?

Sorry Dima but I think that it is too early for that.
