a "Hypergraph" class was introduced in #14712, but there also exists `IncidenceStructure` in `sage/combinat/designs` as well as `set_system` in `sage/matroids`.

We should really start to all work together on the same class, so for now let's deprecate Hypergraph in favor of `IncidenceStructure`.

1) The only interesting thing that `Hypergraph` can do is plot a hypergraph, and `IncidenceStructure` has no such feature.

2) Right now `set_system` claims to be only for internal use, so we cannot use it right now as a replacement right now.

I'm not sure one should `deprecate` one in favour of the other. They are different names of the same object, as far as I am concerned. (IMHO "hypergraph" is a more common name, and there has been a lot of work done in this terminology, especially in TCS people prefer this terminology).

2) add a deprecation warning saying that in the future Hypergraph will be an alias for `IncidenceStructure` but that the input/output are different so that people should use `IncidenceStructure` directly in the meantime

I made a mistake with git commands, and as a result all files were "touched" and I recompile Sage right now... In the meantime I will make sure that all doctests that used to work on `Hypergraph` still work, and I will update the doc/doctests of their new `IncidenceStructure` counterparts.

I have nothing against changing the name of `IncidenceStructure` by the way.

Besides, I suspect that nobody besides me knows that Sage has a Hypergraph class. I began this patch because of some emails with Stefan, which made us notice that we are already doing the same work twice in matroids and designs when it comes to hypergraphs.

I'd rather rename `IncidenceStructure`. There is more Sage-dependent hypergraph code around, some of it quite deep,
cf. http://flagmatic.org/
It's not using Sage's own hypergraph code as it wasn't around at the time this was written, but still...

Well if they don't use it, what exactly is the problem ? In the end `Hypergraph` and `IncidenceStructure` will be the same object anyway.

I personally do not care about backward compatibility, but I know the workflow :

1) I don't care

2) Somebody writes to Sage-devel

3) Everybody throws me stones

4) Deprecation warning

No need to deprecate anything at all. IMHO...

if you just put everything that we have in `Hypergraph` into `IncidenceStructure`, and then do 

```
   Hypergraph = IncidenceStructure
```
you only add more methods to `Hypergraph` and to `IncidenceStructure`. Nothing is removed. How can it break users' code? Why would one need to deprecate?

The input of `Hypergraph` is not the same as `IncidenceStructure`. In `IncidenceStructure` you need to provide the sets of points, which you do not need to do in `Hypergraph`.

Honestly, I am pretty sure that nobody uses this `Hypergraph` class. But I am tired of fighting with everybody for this kind of stuff.

currently `Hypergraph?` and `IncidenceSystem?` say:

```
   A base class for incidence structure (or block design) with
   explicit ground set and blocks.

   INPUT:

   * "points" -- the underlying set. If "points" is an integer v, then
     the set is considered to be {0, ..., v-1}.

   * "blocks" -- the blocks (might be any iterable)
```
It should say more: (my comments are in --- ---)

```
   A base class for incidence structure (or block design, or hypergraphs, or set systems) with
   explicit (or implicit ---DOCUMENTING LATEST CHANGE---) ground set and blocks.

   INPUT:

   * "points" -- the underlying set. In hypergraph terminology: "vertices". If "points" is an integer v, then
     the set is considered to be {0, ..., v-1}. If omitted, it is the union of blocks.

   * "blocks" -- the blocks (might be any iterable). In hypergraph terminology: "edges"; in set systems
     terminology: "sets of the system".

Yes, to draw them - I had to construct a bunch of hypergraphs based on pictures and it was a nice check to see that everything was done correctly. They were quite small and simple, so your code worked OK for me.

Given that even for regular graphs it is hard to automatically produce "the best" or even just "an OK" picture, I doubt that this can be easily done for hypergraphs ;-) Perhaps 3D plots would work better, if we had a nice renderer.

It is true. It can be used to lists all hypergraphs through `hypergraphs.nauty`. I do not think that it is a problem.

There is a "hypergraph" entry in the "Graph theory" section. We cannot really afford to add a "Hypergraph" entry just near the "graph theory" section given the very small amount of code that we ship `O_o`

I think `Incidence structures (i.e. hypergraphs, i.e. set systems)` should be in the top-level list, next to graph theory and matroids. (and no Hypergraphs in Graphs).

And `HyperGraphGenerators` should become `HypergraphGenerators` and go to this section (of the manual, as well as of the code).

Plus there is so little code that putting it on the same level as graphs... `O_o`

I mean, even LP is buried in "numerical" and it is ten times more used and more useful, and combinatorial designs contain a thousand objects that only Sage can build, and it is buried too...

Plus it would mean that the code exists in sage/combinat/designs and the doc actually hints that it should be sage/hypergraphs ?

Sorry Dima but I think that it is too early for that.
