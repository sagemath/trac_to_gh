The function `polytopes.regular_polygon()` uses a hard-coded approximation of `pi` (3.14159265359) which has an error of 466 ulp. Moreover, it uses Python `float`s instead of `RR`.

Note: there are actually a lot of these fishy approximations (like `QQ(1618033)/1000000` for the golden ratio). Since this ticket is intended to avoid a doctest failure in #17130, I only fixed `regular_polygon()`.
