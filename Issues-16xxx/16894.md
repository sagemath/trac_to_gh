A bug in pari 2.7.1 causes this:

```
sage: K.<a> = QuadraticField(22)
sage: u = 42*a - 197 # fundamental unit
sage: D = u^14
sage: D.is_square()
MemoryError: Unable to allocate 327680000000 bytes for the PARI stack
(instead, allocated 262144000000 bytes)
```
This was reported upstream: [http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-1406/msg00006.html](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-users-1406/msg00006.html)

Upstream fixed this in their git master:

```
Not a memory issue indeed. The low-level function from the polroots
module that (sharply) estimates the largest modulus of a polynomial
T can't handle the case T(0) = 0 (nor the case where T is constant,
but that's not the issue here...).

It never occurs in the original context of polroots(), but it can occur
in the context of nfroots / nffactor that call it with T := the image
through the successive complex embeddings of our algebraic polynomial.

Fixed in master (2.8.*). Thanks for your report !
```

General remark: that is not sufficient, since there is also `src/doc` and the Notebook. Better test with `./sage -t --all` instead of manually specifying the directories.

I don't expect the Notebook to break because of this ticket, but there are some docs which have some number theory (e.g. [http://www.sagemath.org/doc/bordeaux_2008/index.html](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/bordeaux_2008/index.html)), so you should test those also.

Bill Allombert just announced (fix 8 is the bug of this ticket)

```

I have made a prerelease of PARI 2.7.2

Please test the prerelease tarball:
<http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/pari-2.7.2-pre1.tar.gz>

Note that this release fixes some rounding error with the multiplication
and division of real numbers. Thus floating point computations can
return slightly different results than 2.7.1, but hopefully more accurate. 

The expected release date is set to the 19/09/2014

Below is the changelog:

Done for version 2.7.2 (released 19/09/2014):
[last column crossreferences current development release 2.8.0]

    4- monomial(exact zero, d, v) returned an invalid t_POL / t_RFRAC     [F26]
    5- contfracpnqn(v, n) returned partial quotients p[-1]/q[-1] ...
       p[n-1]/q[n-1], instead of the documented p[0]/q[0] ... p[n]/q[n]   [F27]
    6- factor((3+4*I)/25) -> factor 2+I had 0 exponent [#1586]            [F29]
BA  7- iferr() could crash if some component of the t_ERROR were clones.  [F31]
    8- nffactor() could overflow the stack when default accuracy too low  [F32]
BA  9- obsolete use of E=[a1,a2,a3,a4,a6] in ellmul crashed  [#1589]      [F33]
   10- incorrect rounding in mulrr/divrr for one-word precision reals     [F34]

   16- zm_zc_mul only worked for square zm matrices                       [F40]
   17- genus2red(0,27*x^5+97*x^4+118*x^3+60*x^2+13*x+1,3) -> bug [#1596]  [F41]
   18- [ghelp] oo loop when $COLUMNS too small [#1594]                    [F42]

I will see Bill next week (we will be at the same conference).  I see that this is a prerelease (= release candidate?) for the next 2 weeks.

I suggest that we do not delay merging this ticket, but at the same time make a new one for 2.7.2 which should be ready in time for the release date.  Is that a good plan?
