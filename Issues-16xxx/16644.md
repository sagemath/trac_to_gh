I believe it's because it's not a new style parent and it doesn't properly initialize its category:

```python
class LinearCode(module.Module_old):
    def __init__(self, gen_mat, d=None):
        ParentWithGens.__init__(self, base_ring)
```
and in `Module_old`:

```python
def category(self):
    """
    Return the category to which this module belongs.
    """
    # Defining a category method is deprecated for parents.
    # Instead, the category should be specified in the constructor.
    # See: http://sagetrac.org/sage_trac/wiki/CategoriesRoadMap
    if self._is_category_initialized():
        return Parent.category(self)
    from sage.categories.modules import Modules
    return Modules(self.base_ring())
```

@tscrim: there is still this problem with `element_class`. I have been able to get some other stuff working with your patch.

```

AttributeError: 'LinearCode_with_category' object has no attribute 'element_class'
```


**Edit**: Also implemented `C.zero()` so that `C.sum()` works.

```
sage: C.zero_element()
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
sage: C.sum(()) # indirect doctest
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```
So, we just need to figure out where this `element_class` is coming from and fix that.

It comes from the category framework, although I believe it is there more for compatibility with old-style parents.

I've made `LinearCode` into a facade parent (because I didn't want to deal with changing it over to have a proper element here...yes I'm being somewhat lazy), put it also in the category of `FiniteEnumeratedSets` (as such, we get `cardinality` for free), and made it so that it passes the `TestSuite`.

@tscrim: I think what vbraun brought up needs to be fixed in the category framework somewhere.

Other than that, we can not depend on `cardinality` of the `FiniteEnumeratedSets`, even if it comes "for free". It comes at a huge cost because it generates all the elements of the linear code - it makes working with large linear codes difficult. We have a vector space structure here, so we can be much more efficient (which was my original patch in this ticket).

```
sage: C = codes.ReedSolomonCode(10, 7, GF(11))
sage: %time C.cardinality()
