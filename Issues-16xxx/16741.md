This really was triky to fix. The permutation code tries to handle several incompatible input i.e. tries to guess whether input is given in list notation or cycle notation, and guesses that from the type list/tuple of input.

Plus some permutation code WANTS permutations on 1...n, others on 0,...,n-1 and others handle everything...
