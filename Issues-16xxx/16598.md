This branch defines:

- `GroupDivisibleDesign`
- `PairwiseBalancedDesign`
- `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`
- `TransversalDesign`

All these classes (which inherit from `IncidenceStructure`) make it easier to do things like compute the `automorphism_group` of a transversal design.

The branch also adds a function `is_group_divisible_design` in `designs_pyx.pyx`, and an empty `is_pairwise_balanced_design` that call it. We can thus get rid of the ugly `_check_pbd`.

Hey Nathann,

In group divisible design, there must be more parameters:
- `v` the size of the ground set
- `K` the admissible size of the blocks
- `G` the admissible size of the groups
The definition seems to be standard (see the big paper of Hanani and the definition IV.1.3 of the Handbook)

Anyway, GDD is just a strict generalization of PBD and it is very clear from Handbook IV.1.3.
That way, your `is_pbd` would just be a lambda function.

Actually, it would be nicer that `IncidenceStructure` would actually be a `GroupDivisibleDesign` (groups being the partition into points). The points can be ordered in such way that the groups are

```
0 1 ... g1-1|g1 g1+1 ... g1+g2-1|...
```
and then the new class would just need an extra `._group_sizes` attribute that would be an integer partition.

Some methods are not well adapted to group divisible designs
- `dual`: is the dual well defined for GDD?
- `incidence_matrix`: must be the incidence matrix group/block (or put a flag allowing to have points/blocks)
- `automorphis_group` is wrong since it must preserver the groups

Why do you use tuples where everywhere in `IncidenceStructure` there are lists?

Would you mind having a "stupid" `.group_sizes()` method?

Vincent

Note that a solution for computing the automorphism group is as follows:
1. compute the automorphism group of the partition into groups (the generators can be provided by hand, and I can provide a function for it)
2. compute the automorphism group of the block design (ie forget about the groups)
3. make the intersection

I think that it is not that bad in terms of efficiency.

Until we want GDD to be defined on something different than `0,...,n-1` just like you did for `IncidenceStructure`

Given that the GDD is a set of blocks, why not ? Plus you wanted two lines above that GDD be equal to an `IncidenceStructure`.

Why ?

Then the implementation is correct.

Yes, I hate those methods. Write it if you want one.

i.e. an automorphism send a non-covered pair of vertices u,v on another non-covered pair of vertices u,v. So a group is sent on another group with the same cardinality.

It corresponds to the notion of automorphism group you expect for BIBD (`K=[1]`), and it also corresponds to the notion of group that you expect on transversal designs (`K=[k]`).

Why do you not translate the groups over integers as it is the case for blocks?

You really like to use tuple of tuples for groups and list of lists for blocks (see [comment:4](#comment:4) above)?

Hello !

> I got it for the automorphism group! Thanks. But your definition of gdd is wrong:

Ahahahahah. Well, that's what I intended, but... is the new version clearer ?

> What do you think of having only one class (with blocks and groups) and methods:

How would you call the class ? If you want to have these functions as methods of something, the only choice I see is `IncidenceStructure`. We would have no `.groups()` method but those functions could get the groups as an argument.

> I do not like the fact of having one extra empty class whose only purpose is a check at creation... 

I just created GDD because it was the common generalization of `TD` and `PBD`. Mostly for the doc at the moment, and we will have some place to put code that works on groups. 

> Moreover, if we switch to mutable classes it would be cool that after transformations we check the kind of thing we obtain. 

Hmmmm... I don't expect that GDD or anything that inherits from it will ever be mutable. `IncidenceStructure` could be mutable someday, though. It wouldn't be cool to have a GDD object which is not a GDD. Plus as you noticed, most of these objects are created from others, rarely modified inplace.

> The only thing that bother me a little bit is this `dual` method which does not make any sense for groups (perhaps it does??).

Well, it just does not consider them. To me those "groups" are a parameter of the design, nothing else... The dual of a dual of a GDD is a GDD, so everything is cool. The blocks are forgotten (they can be re-computed automatically anyway), but who cares ? I don't think that you would find any other definition of the dual of a GDD anywhere...

> Why do you not translate the groups over integers as it is the case for blocks?

Oh. I thought that I would only define GDD for integer ground set, but indeed it also handles the non-integer case almost for free as we know that "._blocks" are already translated to integers. You are right. I will updated that in a second.

> You really like to use tuple of tuples for groups and list of lists for blocks (see [comment:4](#comment:4) above)?

I don't understand. `.groups()` returns lists at the moment (before my commit)

```
def groups(self):
    return map(list,self._groups)
```

Oh, I see ! You meant for internal storage ! Fixed in the new commit.

P.S. : While writing the commit, I made IncidenceStructure mutable. But it's not reaaaaaaaaaaallly a problem, it preserves all the structure ! `:-D`

Hi Nathann,

Groups are not a parameter. If you have a GDD, the group are completely determined by the blocks: define the groups in such way that two points are in the same group if and only if they do not belong to a common block.

So, it makes sense to have `.is_gdd()` at the level of `IncidenceStructure` and make it returns the groups if needed. We can also have a method `.groups()` on `IncidenceStructure` without any attribute `._groups` defined.

What do you think?

Vincent

I don't like it, you cannot define "groups" properly at this level. What do you think the "groups" of `IncidenceStructure(3,[This is the Trac macro *1,2* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1,2-macro))` should be ?

All right, add the extra assumption that each point is covered by at least one block! If not `.groups()` raises an exception.

It's unrelated. What are the blocks of `IncidenceStructure(4,[[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]])` ? I am just telling you that {"u~v" if the pair `u,v` is not covered by a block} is not an equivalence relation unless you are in a GDD.

Hi Nathann,

I added a little commit of cleaning (and also replace the deepcopy by something more explicit) at `u/vdelecroix/16598`.

The semantic of `copy=True/False` is currently not the same with `.blocks()` and `.groups()`. I decided (and you did not complain) that with `copy=False` it just returns a pointer to the attribute `._blocks` which means something on the integers... whatever the ground set could be. If you think it is bad, then we need to change it in `.blocks()` and `.points()`. Otherwise, change it in `.groups()`.

In the function `is_group_divisible_design` it is assumed that the ground set is `{0, ..., v-1}` (which is just find since it is called with the internal data from `GroupDivisibleDesign`). It would be cool to specify it in the doc...

What is the point of `matrix[i*n+j] != <unsigned short> -1` (in `is_group_divisible_design`)?

Vincent

Yes, and when these smart humans look at changelogs to get a sense of new functionality, of course they don't stop there: they open each ticket, read the description, the discussion, and the source code of the branch. And who cares about commit messages when it is so easy to look at diff for anything and make your own judgment unbiased by authors humour?

Or perhaps I am wrong all the way from the start and nobody cares about new functionality or history, so it absolutely does not matter what one can or cannot see in changelogs.

<div id="comment:36" align="right">comment:36</div>

Hi Nathann,

1) There is a problem with your `relabel` method

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure(3, [[0,1,2],[0,1]])
sage: I.relabel({0:'a',1:'b',2:'c'})
sage: I._point_to_index
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
```
but should be `{'a':0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}`.

2) For the string representation of divisible design, would not you prefer `Group Divisible Design on 40 points of type 10^4` instead of the current `Group Divisible Design on 40 points and type 10^4`

3) This is very bad

```
round(sqrt(len(blocks)))
```
(i.e. it involves the symbolic ring). You would prefer using the method `sqrtrem` of Sage integers

```
sage: i,j = 103.sqrtrem()
sage: 103 == i**2 + j
True
```

4) In `is_group_divisible_design` the parts `# Check that the groups belong to [0,...,n-1]` and `# Check that the groups belong to [0,...,n-1]` are very complicated. It is not clear to me that it would be the fastest option (did you do some timings?). Would you mind having a more Pythonic version:

```
# Check that the groups belong to [0,...,n-1]
if any(i < 0 or i >= n for g in groups for i in g):
    # bad groups
    ...
if any(i < 0 or i >= n for b in blocks for i in b):
    # bad blocks
    ...
```

That's all for now.

Vincent

Is it bad to involve the symbolic ring ? `O_o`

I imported sqrt from Python instead.

This code raises an exception when i cannot be turned into an integer. I simplified it a bit, though.

Hi,

Could we move ` _relabel_bibd` as a method of `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign`?

(not very important) Why did you put the classes `PairwiseBalancedDesign` and `BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign` in the file `bibd.py` and not in `incidence_structure.py`? I am not sure about what is the best organization should be, but right now it is not clear at all where to look to find something.

There is still a subtle issue. When we ask for a relabeling we do not necessarily want to relabel the points. More precisely, if the ground set is {0,1,2,3} and I want to relabel {0:1, 1:3, 2:1, 3:0} I would like the ground set to be fixed and the blocks to be changed... what do you think?

Yes: SR is very slow and unreliable (though for sqrt of integers it should be ok).

```
sage: I = IncidenceStructure(4,[[0,1,2],[1,3]])
sage: I.ground_set()
[0, 1, 2, 3]
sage: I.relabel({0:3,1:2,2:1,3:0})
sage: I.ground_set()
[3, 2, 1, 0]
```
the ground set has changed...

Well, as a list it has, not as a set... 

I think that being smart here only raises new problems. Relabelling all blocks takes much more time and memory than relabelling the points only. We could hide that by returning a sorted list of points, but well...
