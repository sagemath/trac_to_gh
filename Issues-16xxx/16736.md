The reason is that webasset setup.py imports sphinx to do some crap. Which ultimately imports PIL/Pillow which causes the egg to be unpacked, violating the sandbox.

Why does sagenb come with webassets to start with? Its not used anywhere, it seems. Some packaged js files were generated with it?

I guess the ideal solution would be to use distutils / pip instead of easy_install (who cares about binary eggs)? Though that would probably be a bigger task. For now, just allow chmod outside of the setuptools sandbox (and, really, fixing permissions isn't so bad).

Updating to the latest setuptools alone didn't fix it, but we should do that anyway.

```
try:

at the top of setup.py There are calls in docs/conf.py but they probably won't be called if we remove the above. I propose we have a patched webassets in sagenb rather than breaking setuptools' sandbox.

Perhaps naive but is there any undesirable side effect of adding something like

`export PYTHON_EGG_CACHE="./.python-eggs"`
