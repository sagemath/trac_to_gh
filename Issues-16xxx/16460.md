Here it is ! Short and efficient, but OA-specific.

Right now it is not linked wth any constructor, it will be done while #16347 is implemented.

The same thing will have to be done later for `incomplete_orthogonal_array`.

Nathann

Depends on #16356

Hi Nathann,

I implemented the changes associated to the following comments in u/vdelecroix/16460.

- the default for `min_false` should be `n+2`? No?
- with the current implementation, the `_set_OA_cache` set a new value to `_OA_cache[n]` even if nothing has changed. This is bad from the global warming point of view.
- it would be better that the keys and values are only Python `int` or only Sage `Integer` but not a mix.

On the other hand, wouldn't it be better to have this in `designs_pyx.pyx`?

Vincent

Yo !

Aahahah right. I had thought about this afterwards and forgot to change it, but I had comforted myself before by figuring out that it had actually no effect on the answers. Because "True" is tested before "False" `:-)`

> - with the current implementation, the `_set_OA_cache` set a new value to `_OA_cache[n]` even if nothing has changed. This is bad from the global warming point of view.

And you think that your added "if" have a zero cost ? To me it is rather useless and adds lines for no point...

> - it would be better that the keys and values are only Python `int` or only Sage `Integer` but not a mix.

I'm not sensible to these problems `:-P`

> On the other hand, wouldn't it be better to have this in `designs_pyx.pyx`?

Ahahah. We are not there yet. There is a long road in front of us before that this caching mechanism represent a non-negligible part of the computations `:-P`

Okay... Well, if you insist on having this "best" test I guess it can go although really I don't see the point... Otherwise if you are okay with not including it I would be glad to add to my branch the part of your commit that converts k,n to Python 'int' if it makes you sleep easier.
