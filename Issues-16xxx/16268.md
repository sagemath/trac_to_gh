Normalize the leading coefficient of the denominator to one when reducing elements of fraction fields of univariate polynomial rings over fields. Doing so
- often leads to more readable results,
- helps limiting coefficient blow-up during computations with fractions over complicated base fields (e.g., elements of ℚ(x,y)(t)), typically leading to much better performance,
- makes hashing more (though not 100%) reliable, see the original description and the comments below.

The following further desirable improvements, out of the scope of this ticket, are dealt with at #26339:
- clearing denominators in the numerator and denominator instead of making the leading coefficient of the denominator monic when that makes sense (i.e., for printing, and perhaps for computations in nested rational function fields, but making it fast enough requires some work),
- also normalizing the leading coefficients over non-fields where that makes sense (see also discussion at #16993).

Original description:

If K is a field then K(u), the function field, has a reduce() method which cancels the gcd but does not put into a canonical form by (for example) dividing through by the leading coefficient of the denominator to make the denominator monic.  This means that equal elements may have different hashes, and hence that putting function field elements into a set does not work as a mathematician would expect.  For example:

```
sage: Ku.<u> = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ,'u'))
sage: a = 27*u^2+81*u+243
sage: b = 27*u-81
sage: c = u^2 + 3*u + 9
sage: d = u-3
sage: s = a/b
sage: t = c/d
sage: s==t
True
sage: len(Set([s,t]))
2
```

I changed the documentation to not say "return". Then did `git trac push`, but apparently something went wrong, since it only changed the branch name without picking up on the new commithash (and hence the summary of my commit). I was hoping trac-user "git" would pick it up with some delay, but apparently not.

I'm not going to change more, as I'm unfamiliar with the conventions about what normalize in `FractionFieldElement` should do when its not actually guaranteeing that numerator and denominator are the same for a == b after calling normalize on both.

I couldn't help myself and hacked a bit on this.
* Removed normalize from generic `FractionFieldElement`, as I don't think it can live up to the behaviour in its documentation. For instance (2x)/(2x+1) and (-2x)/(-2x-1) in Q(ZZ[x]) did not have the same normalisation. I doubt this can be fixed for general rings.
* Removed call to reduce for non-exact rings, as reduces' documentation says "Automatically called for exact rings, but because it may be numerically unstable for inexact rings it must be called manually in that case."
* Raise `NotImplementedError` in generic `FractionFieldElement.__hash__` except when the denominator is 1. In this exceptional case the hash necessarily agrees with the hash of the corresponding element of the integral domain and therefore can be computed without any trouble.

I (re)implemented hashing for elements of Q(R[X]) with R an integral domain, by passing from Q(R[X]) to Q(Q(R)[X]), reducing to the case of this bug. I haven't pushed this, as I don't like the architecture in my patch and that should probably be a separate bug anyway. There should probably be separate bug reports for many kinds of rings.

I had already started by patching the reduce function but had not yet discoivered where the automatic calling of reduction was actually happening.  Your solution -- keeping reduce() and normalise() separate -- looks better.\n\nIMO having `reduce()` normalize the leading coefficient is actually a better choice, because it helps limiting coefficient blow-up in computations with rational functions.\n\nHere is another attempt that does that. See the commit messages for more information. (Addendum: this fixes #16993.

Replying to [@JohnCremona](#comment%3A5):
> Thanks, Robert, I will review this.  I had already started by patching the reduce function but had not yet discoivered where the automatic calling of reduction was actually happening.  Your solution -- keeping reduce() and normalise() separate -- looks better.

IMO having `reduce()` normalize the leading coefficient is actually a better choice, because it helps limiting coefficient blow-up in computations with rational functions.

Here is another attempt that does that. See the commit messages for more information. (Addendum: this fixes #16993. Fixing #15297 in full generality requires more work, but could be done as a follow-up.)

I'll try that and look again at the test failures to see what makes sense.

Yes. But even that is not always possible, unfortunately.

Depending whether we are working with univariate rational function over a field or not, actually, isn't it?

I'm not sure. This is also related to the issue of provinding a normal form for more general fraction field elements (starting with rational functions over non-fields, I guess), and hence I agree that this would best be kept for another ticket.

With the current implementation "is this a univariate rational function over a field" is the criterion, yes. The point is that the criterion changes when the implementation changes, and no one will know except by looking at the code for their specific kind of base ring.

(For instance the present normalization easily generalizes to the multivariate case by looking at the leading coefficient for some [monomial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order).)

I was hoping for a convincing argument on why making `reduce` more powerful is better than keeping `normalize` around, as my initial preference would be towards `normalize` because I generally prefer explicit over implicit.

Ok, the only failures I'm seeing are in `src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/` and apparently come from the fact that `FormsRingElement` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation` but is sometimes called on fractions with floating-point coefficients. I guess it would be possible to port it to `UniqueFactory` and somehow preprocess the arguments to avoid the warning.

However, I wonder if it wouldn't be better to keep `__hash__()` as it is now, and have `==` over inexact rings return `True` only when the fractions are equal *without reduction*. Then, hashing would be consistent with equality, the (arguably valid) use case of indexing a table by inexact fractions would work without warning, and hashing wouldn't break the promise that fractions over inexact ring are not automatically reduced. For `==`, this would consistent with the semantics of equality in “difficult” cases like interval arithmetic and symbolic expressions, where `a == b` may return `False` in cases where `a` and `b` are actually equal but that could not be verified. (Not for `!=`, though, but I don't see what we could do about that.)

What do you think?

Essentially, I agree with you. I'm just saying that I'd rather keep that question for later, and address it once we have a way of normalizing in more general situations, probably along the lines of what you suggested at #16993.

#16993 should probably be closed as a dup of this ticket.

Also, should there be a follow-up ticket for the desirable further improvements mentioned in the ticket description?

Yes, thanks, I had forgotten to do that.
