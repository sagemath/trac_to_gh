```
Normalize the leading coefficient of the denominator to one when reducing elements of fraction fields of univariate polynomial rings over fields. Doing so
- often leads to more readable results,
- helps limiting coefficient blow-up during computations with fractions over complicated base fields (e.g., elements of ℚ(x,y)(t)), typically leading to much better performance,
- makes hashing more (though not 100%) reliable, see the original description and the comments below.

The following further desirable improvements, out of the scope of this ticket, are dealt with at #26339:
- clearing denominators in the numerator and denominator instead of making the leading coefficient of the denominator monic when that makes sense (i.e., for printing, and perhaps for computations in nested rational function fields, but making it fast enough requires some work),
- also normalizing the leading coefficients over non-fields where that makes sense (see also discussion at #16993).

Original description:

If K is a field then K(u), the function field, has a reduce() method which cancels the gcd but does not put into a canonical form by (for example) dividing through by the leading coefficient of the denominator to make the denominator monic.  This means that equal elements may have different hashes, and hence that putting function field elements into a set does not work as a mathematician would expect.  For example:

```
sage: Ku.<u> = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ,'u'))
sage: a = 27*u^2+81*u+243
sage: b = 27*u-81
sage: c = u^2 + 3*u + 9
sage: d = u-3
sage: s = a/b
sage: t = c/d
sage: s==t
True
sage: len(Set([s,t]))
2
```

I'm not going to change more, as I'm unfamiliar with the conventions about what normalize in `FractionFieldElement` should do when its not actually guaranteeing that numerator and denominator are the same for a == b after calling normalize on both.

I (re)implemented hashing for elements of Q(R[X]) with R an integral domain, by passing from Q(R[X]) to Q(Q(R)[X]), reducing to the case of this bug. I haven't pushed this, as I don't like the architecture in my patch and that should probably be a separate bug anyway. There should probably be separate bug reports for many kinds of rings.

IMO having `reduce()` normalize the leading coefficient is actually a better choice, because it helps limiting coefficient blow-up in computations with rational functions.

Here is another attempt that does that. See the commit messages for more information. (Addendum: this fixes #16993. Fixing #15297 in full generality requires more work, but could be done as a follow-up.)

They are still there, after the introductory sentence instead of the "EXAMPLES:" heading.

I don't like that either. But over an inexact ring, the precondition of hashing would be violated anyway, because of the round-off errors during the computation of the reduction and the equality test. So what I'm suggesting in order to move forward is to keep the broken hash in this case, to be closer to bug-for-bug compatibility with the historic implementation...

This issue with equality appears almost everywhere in Sage, and unfortunately, I think we have to live with it. The only real fix IMO would be to drop the use of `==` for mathematical equality, define it to mean “syntactic” equality of the data structures (after normalization when relevant) instead, and introduce a separate method for mathematical equality. But that's not going to happen without a Sage fork at least, I guess...

I'll try that and look again at the test failures to see what makes sense.

> I am aware that in general sage does not guarantee "`x == y` implies `hash(x) == hash(y)`", but if I recall correctly, it did strive to uphold this implication when `x` and `y` have the same parent.


Yes. But even that is not always possible, unfortunately.

Instead `reduce` now maybe normalizes the numerator and denominator or maybe not, depending on the implementation.


Depending whether we are working with univariate rational function over a field or not, actually, isn't it?

I'm not sure. This is also related to the issue of provinding a normal form for more general fraction field elements (starting with rational functions over non-fields, I guess), and hence I agree that this would best be kept for another ticket.

With the current implementation "is this a univariate rational function over a field" is the criterion, yes. The point is that the criterion changes when the implementation changes, and no one will know except by looking at the code for their specific kind of base ring.

(For instance the present normalization easily generalizes to the multivariate case by looking at the leading coefficient for some [monomial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order).)

I was hoping for a convincing argument on why making `reduce` more powerful is better than keeping `normalize` around, as my initial preference would be towards `normalize` because I generally prefer explicit over implicit.

Ok, the only failures I'm seeing are in `src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/` and apparently come from the fact that `FormsRingElement` inherits from `UniqueRepresentation` but is sometimes called on fractions with floating-point coefficients. I guess it would be possible to port it to `UniqueFactory` and somehow preprocess the arguments to avoid the warning.

However, I wonder if it wouldn't be better to keep `__hash__()` as it is now, and have `==` over inexact rings return `True` only when the fractions are equal *without reduction*. Then, hashing would be consistent with equality, the (arguably valid) use case of indexing a table by inexact fractions would work without warning, and hashing wouldn't break the promise that fractions over inexact ring are not automatically reduced. For `==`, this would consistent with the semantics of equality in “difficult” cases like interval arithmetic and symbolic expressions, where `a == b` may return `False` in cases where `a` and `b` are actually equal but that could not be verified. (Not for `!=`, though, but I don't see what we could do about that.)

What do you think?

Essentially, I agree with you. I'm just saying that I'd rather keep that question for later, and address it once we have a way of normalizing in more general situations, probably along the lines of what you suggested at #16993.

Yes, thanks, I had forgotten to do that.

> Also, should there be a follow-up ticket for the desirable further improvements mentioned in the ticket description?


Please go ahead if you want to open additional tickets and/or work on these improvements. (I have little time to work on them myself at the moment, unfortunately, but feel free to ping me if some follow-up ticket needs review.)
