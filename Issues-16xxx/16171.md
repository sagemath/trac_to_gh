Cones already make sure that 1-d faces are sorted in the same way as rays. Let's also make facets listed in the same order as facet normals: the first of these lists is stored as is and the second one is sorted, no matter in which order they are computed (facets can be determined from the ambient structure without normals). The corner case when facets are rays is handled as well by sorting facet normals immediately.
