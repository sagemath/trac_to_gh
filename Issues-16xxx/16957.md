Ticket #16743 included an algorithm to determine whether two elliptic curves over a number field are isogenous. This ticket extends the algorithm to also sort isogenous classes of elliptic curves using the L-functions.

Depends on #16743

Component: **elliptic curves**

We decided not to do this.  If you factor the L-functions into Euler products by the primes of the field K then you have to sort the primes of each norm, a problem in itself.  If you just factor over Q then conjugate curves have the same L-function.

What Sage currently does is this:   the curves in an isogeny class almost always have distinct j-invariants, so we first sort by j-invariant (using the method for sorting number field elements already in Sage).  Usually that is enough, which is good since then the order is independent of the Weierstrass models. The only case when it is not enough is when E has potential CM, as then it is isogenous to its quadratic twist by the relevant CM field but not isomorphic (that is what "potential" means).  In that case we use the vector of a-invariants for sorting; in which case the order will in general depend on which Weierstrass models are used, which is unfortunate, but no-one has yet come up with a better tie-break.
