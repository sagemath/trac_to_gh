The current version of `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` incorrectly sets the package version to the **literal** `"VERSION"` in `checksums.ini`, which is confusing and not helpful.

This patch correcly computes the version string and puts it at the right place in `checksums.ini`.

Component: **build**

Hmm "fubar"?

Having old tarballs in upstream/ is normal and shouldn't lead to endless warnings.

IMHO there shouldn't be any warnings, anything that is not correct ought to be a hard error. If we aren't strict about it we are bound to get track tickets with invalid checksums.ini.

You must put 3.10.1.20140128.p0 in package-version.txt.\n> ```\n\nHmmm... Now we have a conflict on intended usage(s) (and therefore designs) :\n* The `builg/pkgs/<pkgname>/...` structure implies at most one version per package name.\n* The relevant snippet of the [Developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#checksums) hints at a \"batch\" usage of `src/bin/sage-fix-pkg-checksums.`\nSo far, that's consistent with `upstream/` as **the** set of active (i. e. built by Sage's build system) Sage's external packages source tarballs.\n* Your intended usage amounts to use `upstream/` as **a** cache of potential external packages, the set of **active** Sage external packages being determined otherwise.\n    a. This might be the `build/pkgs/*/package-version.txt` set, in which case the `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` script should loop over this set and try to find a relevant tarball. At most, it might spit a warning (or fail) when no such tarball exists. No automatic rewriting possible.\n    b. It might be an external file listing each package and the relevant version. That makes `build/pkgs/<pkgname>/package-version.txt` redundant (and a possible source of conflicts).\nThe case 1. is consistent, but needs a script like `sage-fix-one-pkg-checksum-Volkers-style` to generate the right checksums. As said before, the current batch-style script should loop on the `build/pkgs/...` tree.\n\nIn any case, it appears that the consistency of the proposed change (use `upstream/` as a cache and not as a reference set) needs modifying the use of this script (and, quite possibly, the rest of the build subsystem for external packages). Since I do not yet know my way in this system, fixing this is, for now, out of my reach. At a minimum, I need advice from someone knowing what it does.\n\nBy the way, what is wrong with an external (`.gitignore`d) directory and `mv` ing the right tarball at the right time ? An even lazier solution is, of course, to symlink the right tarball in `upstream/`, but I doubt one can get `git` to follow this transparently.\n\nSince we are playing redesigning this subsystem, may I ask why we have to have `package-version.txt` and `checksums.ini` to describe different attributes of the same tarball ? Why not one file ?",

Hmmm... Now we have a conflict on intended usage(s) (and therefore designs) :
* The `builg/pkgs/<pkgname>/...` structure implies at most one version per package name.
* The relevant snippet of the [Developer's guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/packaging.html#checksums) hints at a "batch" usage of `src/bin/sage-fix-pkg-checksums.`
So far, that's consistent with `upstream/` as **the** set of active (i. e. built by Sage's build system) Sage's external packages source tarballs.
* Your intended usage amounts to use `upstream/` as **a** cache of potential external packages, the set of **active** Sage external packages being determined otherwise.
    a. This might be the `build/pkgs/*/package-version.txt` set, in which case the `sage-fix-pkg-checksums` script should loop over this set and try to find a relevant tarball. At most, it might spit a warning (or fail) when no such tarball exists. No automatic rewriting possible.
    b. It might be an external file listing each package and the relevant version. That makes `build/pkgs/<pkgname>/package-version.txt` redundant (and a possible source of conflicts).
The case 1. is consistent, but needs a script like `sage-fix-one-pkg-checksum-Volkers-style` to generate the right checksums. As said before, the current batch-style script should loop on the `build/pkgs/...` tree.

In any case, it appears that the consistency of the proposed change (use `upstream/` as a cache and not as a reference set) needs modifying the use of this script (and, quite possibly, the rest of the build subsystem for external packages). Since I do not yet know my way in this system, fixing this is, for now, out of my reach. At a minimum, I need advice from someone knowing what it does.

By the way, what is wrong with an external (`.gitignore`d) directory and `mv` ing the right tarball at the right time ? An even lazier solution is, of course, to symlink the right tarball in `upstream/`, but I doubt one can get `git` to follow this transparently.

Since we are playing redesigning this subsystem, may I ask why we have to have `package-version.txt` and `checksums.ini` to describe different attributes of the same tarball ? Why not one file ?

The upstream/ directory has always been meant as a cache where possibly multiple versions of tarballs are stored, potentially even shared between different sage installations. This is also how the sage-fix-pkg-checksums script works right now, it looks for a tarball matching `build/pkgs/*/package-version.txt` and ignores the rest.

The split package-version.txt and checksums.ini is to make reading the version easier from scripts. I didn't vote for it...

I beg to differ : From the current `sage-fix-pkg-checksum`, (as in the `develop` branch) :

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# If any command-line arguments are present, treat them as files to be
# checksummed. If no arguments are present, all tarballs in
# $SAGE_ROOT/upstream are checksummed.
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    cd "$SAGE_ROOT"
    set upstream/*.tar*
fi
```

In other words, the current version is driven by the content of `upstream/` if no argument is given. If an (some) argument(s) is|are given, it uses the beginning of each argument up to the first dash as a package name and whatever follows `tar` in this argument as the compression method. Therefore, this will produce the expected behaviour IF AND ONLY IF the script is passed tarball filenames.

It will also produce the expected result if given arguments **containing the package version**. But not with arguments containing the package name only : there is no information available to choose which version is to be documented in `build/pkgs/<pkgname>/package-version.txt|checksums.ini`.

A simple fix is to ignore package version mismatchs (i. e. removing the error message an the abort). In this case, the tarball ultimately documented in `build/pkgs/<pkgname>/checksums.ini` will be the one passed in argument, or the last matching the package name in the `upstream/` file list (lexicographic order).

Another possibility is to use `build/pkgs` ad the corresponding `package-version.txt` to get the necessary information, and search `upstream/` for a relevant tarball. In this case, one might find one tarball (and process it as before), none (one type of error) or more than one (another type of error).

Which one do you want ?

Authors: please describe what this patch is supposed to do, because the previous description was wrong (`package-version.txt` isn't changed by `sage-fix-pkg-checksums`)  and confusing! It's easier to review when I know what this patch is supposed to achieve.

And fix the indentation please: no TABS, use indents of 4 spaces

And I would like to add an additional change:

```
upstream_pkg_name=${tarball%-*}
```
should become

```
upstream_pkg_name=${tarball%%-*}
```
to allow upstream versions with dashes (package-abc-1 should have package name "package" and version "abc-1").
