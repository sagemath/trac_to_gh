Right now the Sage reference manual includes fewer than 10 of the many command-line options.  The attached patch improves the situation.

I fixed some minor issues in your patch. It's somewhat annoying that this differs from the output of sage -advanced. Maybe it would be worthwhile to get both into sync again. But this should probably be done after #21.
Anyway, it's great to have such a list in the reference manual. So, if you're happy with my changes, feel free to set it to positive review.
