Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat @nthiery @fchapoton stumpc5 @anneschilling mshimo @darijgr @jplab @dwbump

Keywords: coxeter groups, reflections

Currently, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
[[-1]]
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
Finite family {[0 1]
[1 0]: (1, -1)}
```
In particular, the former returns a list of elements in the group, whereas the latter returns a family whose keys are elements in the group and whose values are roots. This leads to different iterator behaviors between the two. Since Weyl groups are a subcategory of Coxeter groups, we should make this behavior consistent.

Note, this was introduced by #11010 and is specific for the matrix implementation of `CoxeterGroup`. We can also lift this up to the category of (finite) Coxeter groups.

Hi Travis,

also in the light of hopefully having soon the `chevie` version of reflection groups:
* What do you think is the correct behaviour?
* Does it make sense to allow user labels of the reflections in the case of finite reflection groups? -- this might be interesting in the situation that you want to look for words in all reflections. (But that also puts another layer of possible bugs!)
There, is is currently

```
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1]).reflections()
Finite family {0: (1,2)}
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1],reflection_index_set=["A"]).reflections()
Finite family {'A': (1,2)}
```

Oops, really, `reflections` does not return a collection of reflections? It makes sense to index the reflections by roots; and it can be ok to have the index set depend on the implementation, and or to return the collection as a plain list/tuple. But returning a family of roots indexed by reflections feels really weird. I am surprised I did not catch this earlier.

> It makes sense to index the reflections by roots


for the complex reflection groups to come, this would not make sense, so if we want to have these to have similar behaviour, such an indexing would be bad.

I think it is best to have them be consistent, which we can easily do by making `CoxeterGroup.reflections` return a family indexed by the reflections whose values are the roots.

With that being said, in many ways I feel that it is more natural for the family to be indexed by the roots and the values be reflections. It means we can just do `for x in W.reflections()` as I don't think of roots as *being* reflection (instead of corresponding to).

I would return a family with the keys being roots and values being reflections. Since iteration over a family is iteration over the values, this will be consistent with complex reflection groups returning a tuple (taking advantage of ducktyping). At least, I don't think of reflections having a natural total ordering, so you should only be iterating over all them.

Agreed. I meant: it's a reasonable indexing in the above example. I guess at this point we want to leave freedom of the indexing set, and only impose that reflections return a collection of elements of the group.

See Dyer "Hecke algebras and shellings of Bruhat intervals" for the importance of reflection orderings ;-). I usually want them to come at least in some "convex order" as in that paper...

Anyway, I am fine with giving freedom to the keys, and only force that iteration does iters through the actual reflections.

Okay, here is where I am at. I flipped the key/value order on `WeylGroup.reflections()`. I made `CoxeterGroup.reflections()` return a family. Additionally, I did some cleanup on the ``@`cached_method` returning mutable objects. This included removing the caching of `positive_roots` as it did not appear to be called anywhere except in `roots()`, which is cached, so I don't see a reason to cache it (moreover, getting the keys from a `Family` should be fast).

So now my questions are these:

- Do we want to issue a warning for the change in behavior for `WeylGroup.reflections()`? If so, how should we?
- Do we want to lift one or both of these implementations to the category (and on this ticket)?
- Do we want to implement an iterator over all reflections for infinite groups? This could be done by a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` which goes by conjugating by simple reflections corresponding to the non-descents of a given reflection.

`@`stumpc5 I agree that convex orders are natural and important, but we would still need a natural/canonical reduced expression for the long element. Although I guess we could use the reduced expression that gives the BZL strings (I only know this for type A<sub>n</sub> though...), but this still feels somewhat artificial to me.
