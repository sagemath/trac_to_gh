Keywords: coxeter groups, reflections

Currently, we have the following behavior:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
[[-1]]
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',1])
sage: W.reflections()
Finite family {[0 1]
[1 0]: (1, -1)}
```

In particular, the former returns a list of elements in the group, whereas the latter returns a family whose keys are elements in the group and whose values are roots. This leads to different iterator behaviors between the two. Since Weyl groups are a subcategory of Coxeter groups, we should make this behavior consistent.

Note, this was introduced by #11010 and is specific for the matrix implementation of `CoxeterGroup`. We can also lift this up to the category of (finite) Coxeter groups.

Hi Travis,

also in the light of hopefully having soon the `chevie` version of reflection groups:
* What do you think is the correct behaviour?
* Does it make sense to allow user labels of the reflections in the case of finite reflection groups? -- this might be interesting in the situation that you want to look for words in all reflections. (But that also puts another layer of possible bugs!)
There, is is currently

```
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1]).reflections()
Finite family {0: (1,2)}
sage: ReflectionGroup(['A',1],reflection_index_set=["A"]).reflections()
Finite family {'A': (1,2)}
```

for the complex reflection groups to come, this would not make sense, so if we want to have these to have similar behaviour, such an indexing would be bad.

I think it is best to have them be consistent, which we can easily do by making `CoxeterGroup.reflections` return a family indexed by the reflections whose values are the roots.

With that being said, in many ways I feel that it is more natural for the family to be indexed by the roots and the values be reflections. It means we can just do `for x in W.reflections()` as I don't think of roots as *being* reflection (instead of corresponding to).

I would return a family with the keys being roots and values being reflections. Since iteration over a family is iteration over the values, this will be consistent with complex reflection groups returning a tuple (taking advantage of ducktyping). At least, I don't think of reflections having a natural total ordering, so you should only be iterating over all them.

Agreed. I meant: it's a reasonable indexing in the above example. I guess at this point we want to leave freedom of the indexing set, and only impose that reflections return a collection of elements of the group.

See Dyer "Hecke algebras and shellings of Bruhat intervals" for the importance of reflection orderings ;-). I usually want them to come at least in some "convex order" as in that paper...

Anyway, I am fine with giving freedom to the keys, and only force that iteration does iters through the actual reflections.

Okay, here is where I am at. I flipped the key/value order on `WeylGroup.reflections()`. I made `CoxeterGroup.reflections()` return a family.

This included removing the caching of `positive_roots` as it did not appear to be called anywhere except in `roots()`, which is cached, so I don't see a reason to cache it (moreover, getting the keys from a `Family` should be fast).

So now my questions are these:

- Do we want to issue a warning for the change in behavior for `WeylGroup.reflections()`? If so, how should we?
- Do we want to lift one or both of these implementations to the category (and on this ticket)?
- Do we want to implement an iterator over all reflections for infinite groups? This could be done by a `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` which goes by conjugating by simple reflections corresponding to the non-descents of a given reflection.

`@`stumpc5 I agree that convex orders are natural and important, but we would still need a natural/canonical reduced expression for the long element. Although I guess we could use the reduced expression that gives the BZL strings (I only know this for type A<sub>n</sub> though...), but this still feels somewhat artificial to me.
