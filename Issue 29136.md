Tests run at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/60588138

these tests are pretty much a waste, as the package is not yet on Sage's mirrors, and thus its installation fails. One should have used the new feature with an explcit URL to download from.

the testing framework also needs a feature to force using particular non-system packages, as every "standard" run with freetype available from the system does not do anything meaningful here.

The new Upstream URL feature is used in these tests, and it's working. What are you looking at?

See #29367 EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS

now I see that it's a different kind of problem, sorry - but still a problem.

probably instead of using something meaninful (wget is able to get the file just fine), it uses an improperly set Python-based downloader.

This might be a slackware-specific issue, though.

Yes, thanks for spotting this. I'll try to fix this on #29354.

Rebased on 9.1.beta9, needs review

Still needs review

This seems to solve the problem for slackware standard install.

For minimal install it fails to build git for some reason.

[https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/68003296](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/68003296).

I can also confirm that the upgrade works fine on debian buster and `sage -t --all` passes.

See #29424 for this.

Is there anything to pay attention to?

LGTM.

I guess one needs to check that the update does not break plotting.

Ok. I ran [https://matplotlib.org/contents.html](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) and [https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/text/mathtext.html](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/text/mathtext.html) with and without upgrade and I don't see a difference.
