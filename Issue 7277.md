Permutahedra are very useful in a lot of contexts, and they have the interesting property that their symmetry group is a semidirect product of the cyclic group of order two and the symmetric group. These should be in the permgroup_named file, so they are easy to access and compare.

Actually they are just the direct product of these, and we do have #17243 where this could be mentioned.

Since I opened it as a request, I hope it's okay that I ask for it to be closed "upon further review".
