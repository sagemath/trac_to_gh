If I convert a powerseries into the symbolic ring, it does not have any variables.

```
sage: R.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s = R([1,2,3,4,5],prec=10)
sage: s
1 + 2*x + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4 + O(x^10)
sage: SR(s)
1 + 2*x + 3*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 5*x^4 + O(x^10)
sage: SR(s).variables()
()
```

Running simplify() fixes it:

```
sage: SR(s).simplify().variables()
(x,)
```

Note that GiNaC will not add an order term to series from polynomials even if requested. I would consider this a bug. The reason is that pseries are formal, anyway, so they should be fully manipulatable.

This restriction can be circumvented with a simple trick.
