This branch is now ready for review!  George Seelinger has already reviewed this code (https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage/issues/6) and the code has been modified accordingly, so there shouldn't be much left to do.

One small question:

1. The sagedocs say I should use "this" terminology in my docstrings for methods.  For example, given a method `score` for the Partition object, the docstring would say something like "find the score of this partition" as opposed to "given a partition, find its score".  Should I go ahead and alter all of the language in my method docstrings accordingly?  (It's a lot of work, so I want to make sure it's necessary before I spend a lot of time doing it).

I am a very strong -1 to that (grr...they snuck that change in). Use ```self``` as that never causes any problems or ambiguity. Also, for methods, the first argument must be `self`.

However, your docstrings are mal-formatted. It should be:

```
def foo(self, bar):
    r"""
    One line description saying what the method does.

    Long description but keep each line at most 80 characters
    unless necessary. This is where you put the more conceptual
    information.
    """
```


You might find the `.. PLOT::` syntax useful. However, just use the `ascii_art` or `.pp()` for the diagrams of the partitions instead of pictures. That is sufficient, but I think is generally overkill for such small examples.

The `_is_sequence` is mostly useless and does not test what its name suggests (e.g., it does not handle `tuple`). It also is not used. Remove it.

Similarly for `is_*_decreasing`. Just inline them. The code makes it clear what is going on.

You are too verbose in your descriptions in, e.g., `boundary()` as you are just saying the same thing as the output. (That `TESTS::` block is mal-formatted as well.)

Error messages are not complete sentences, so not capitalized and no period at the end.

Typo: `THerefore`.

It is better to use `_Partitions(la)` than `Partition(la)` as there is less indirection.

I will likely have more comments once these things are fixed.

```
        has boundary [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]::

            sage: Partition([1]).boundary()
            [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]

When you say "useless by itself", do you mean useless to end users?  Certainly, it is not uncommon to have code that is not meant to be used by end users.  These are components which help other parts of the code to run.  Many languages designate pieces of code as "private" or "protected" for this reason.

The benefit of a utility function like this one is eliminating redundancy.  This makes code shorter.  If a change needs to be made to the code, it only needs to be made once, instead of in many places simultaneously.  It also decreases the chances of accidentally changing one thing and not another, causing glitches and loss of time troubleshooting.  In addition, it helps keep behavior/usage consistent across many end-user functions.

The benefit of *not* having such a function is that other functions become more self-contained, which makes it easier for somebody to alter one of those functions in the future.

I wish to learn and understand why certain choices are made.  I think you should elaborate on the "why" behind your opinions, so that the sage community can learn and have lasting change where improvements need to be made, and disabuse misconceptions when they occur.

else:
    return self[0] <= k
```


j) Documentation of `is_k_reducible`, `is_k_irreducible`, `has_rectangle`, `has_k_rectangle` should all say "its Ferrer's diagram" not "it's Ferrer's diagram"

k) I think the assertion statement of `is_k_reducible` should include the comment above in the error message.

a)
removed: BMPS2018b, Fun2012, LN2014.

did not remove: Fuchs1994, HS1968.  These two are part of the develop branch.  They appear in the diff because they caused a merge conflict.

b) removed NOTE

c) fixed

d) I have specified the French convention and provided a small example of the French convention.  (but i didn't see the need for talking about the english convention because it thought it would be too much)  Please read it and let me know if it is satisfactory or not.

Also, should perhaps cite the paper in boundary docstring too?

e1) INPUT block added.

e2) done

f) done

g) something was wrong here.  the examples were using is_k_reducible instead of has_k_rectangle.  i have changed them to has_k_rectangle.

h) done

i) Took your advice, but now added `assert k >= 0`

j) done

k) done

l) Definitely a hair splitter.  I will leave both.

m) okay, you do have a point.  done.

n) So is min and max.  I really broke all the rules on this one.  But I chose these keywords because they were clear, short, and convenient for the user.

changed type to partition_type (because i think its more clear)

o) Removed, but combined the docstrings since the other one had some issues.

I have :meth:`Core` in the docstring but i think it's a typo.  I'm pretty sure it should be :class:`Core`?

p) Also, a reference to the "well-known" bijection would be good.  Do you know of any (published) sources we can reference?

Do you think this method is redundant?

z) Wow, I can't believe we went through the whole alphabet.  I agree, but let's wait until after everything else is resolved.

d) Decided not to cite because there is no definition of "boundary" in the papers as is used here.  The boundary here is useful in calculating the k_rim, and is sensible as its own concept.

o) Are you positive it is correct?  It is currently :meth:`Core`, not :meth:`core`.

p) `to_k_core` now deleted because it is NOT a generalization of the canonical bijection as we originally thought

z) My text editor has a feature where you put down a ruler (staff) at 80 characters and then you say "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"

That's done now.

NOTE: Before your review is complete, can you rerun the doctests?  There is an issue with my sage installation and also I haven't had a chance to upgrade to the newer version.

o) In the docstring paragraph, `:meth:`core`` is used. In the SEEALSO block, it honestly makes sense to have *both* `:meth:`core`` and `:class:`Core``.

Doctests are currently passing for me. 

However, documentation is not building because 

q) the path for `k-rim.JPG` is wrong. It should be `../../media/k-rim.JPG`. 

r) Also, the INPUT blocks were not quite "line broken" correctly.

s) I think describing ``self`` in the input block is unnecessary and not typically done in Sage conventions unless there is something out of the ordinary going on.

I have gone ahead and fixed these minor things myself. If you agree with the changes, you may set the ticket to "Positive Review".
