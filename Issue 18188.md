According to the mercurial history of `nauty-25.spkg`, the "patch" (actually a file to overwrite the existing one) `gtools-h.in` was introduced in 2010 for version 2.4 of nauty in order "to compile on Ubuntu and other systems". Inbetween, the file `gtools-h.in` has evolved, so keeping it does not let us benefit from the evolution, hence i propose to simply remove it and test to see if some problem appears on some machines.

I disagree with the change you made to keep the original tarball. I initially did the same, then decided against it when I noticed the directory name problem that you avoided with:

```
+NAUTY_VERSION="$(cat ${SAGE_ROOT}/build/pkgs/nauty/package-version.txt)"
+SRC="nauty${NAUTY_VERSION}"
```


I do not think that it is a good idea to do this, as we could very well imagine that other scripts be written that apply to the packages, and those would expect a correctly named package.

Furthermore, I consider it very bad manners to go on somebody else's ticket, change the branch name and change the commits without even getting the ticket's author's agreement. Please do not do this again.

I set the ticket to its original content. If you have requests to make as a reviewer, please do.

What does "Tell if it is OK like that." mean ?

I don't understand your point at all. I did not remove your branch, i just propose some modifications for discussion. I guess in that case it is easier to propose changes that people could download to test (e.g. does nauty still work without the old patch), than asking the author of the previous commits to remove the patch themselves so that i can download their changes to see what happens. Same with requesting a spkg-check, then have to inspect it to filnally request some output parsing because it may fail silently if coded as the other similar files.

I understand that trac `Branch` field is not well designed since it does not allow to show various branches, but i do not see what can i do else than `git trac push` to show the proposed modifications on the ticket.

More generally, i do not understand why the people that opens a ticket owns it, Sage is a common goods that people try to improve collectively, not a staked territory. If you want to own a ticket, please write it explicitely by fillind the related field, i will not bother you on those.

Just picture several guys talking around a table. Guy '1' has an idea, and begins to explain it. Midway, you tell him to shut up and you explain to the others what you think that his idea is. That's how I see it.

I did. The branch is named `u/ncohen/18425`, to which you have no write access. When I create branches to which anybody is welcome to contribute (e.g. reorganization of the doc, which cover all domains at once), I use a branch named `public/something`.

There are two points:
 1) if you would like the shipped binaries to be prefixed like other nice software like sage, complain upstream
 2) if the information you are worried about is the content of the nauty package, its binaries in particular, that's a defect of the sage packaging system that it doesn't have a database of the files installed by its various packages. This is a more advanced feature that has always been out of scope.

And about consistency, it is actually a good thing. Suppose that someone has some program or script that uses `nauty` and wants to use them in sage. I think they will be surprised when their scripts/programs don't work out of the box after installing sage's nauty package. It may actually take them time to figure out that they have to prefix everything.

Adding a prefix specifically in sage goes against the principle of least surprise because you modify what is expected from upstream. The only case where it is justified is a clash in name (in which case it is proper to involve both upstreams if possible).

This is precisely what i did, i created `u/tmonteil/18425`. I did not touch the branch `u/ncohen/18425`, it is still here, unmodified.

> Add a comment to tell the other guy what you did and where to find the branch, and that he can add them to the ticket's branch if he agrees.

Again, which word didn't you understand in "Tell if it is OK like that." ?

I still do not get your point about detached branches, there is zero benefits from detached branches over attached ones provided by `git trac push`. The `git trac push` command pushes the branch to git and let trac know about this, this is why both git and trac are on the same host, so that there is an additional information that links a branch to a particular ticket. The branch `u/tmonteil/18425` is about this ticket, so `git trac push` let trac know about it. In particular, the commits and their description will appear on the trac ticket as cliquable links so that people regisered on the ticket will know about it, and anyone can easily browse them. Please read http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/git_trac.html

I am very sorry about your interpretation, here is how things happened actually:

- we were discussing the opportunity to remove the old-stlye bitrotting spkgs, and the difficulty to know which of them could be safely removed, and i was mentioning that nauty was the only one that i still use to build Sage Debian Live,
- you asked me to send you nauty-25.spkg because you could not find it elsewhere,
- i looked for it, and find it on the remote server that was used to build SDL and sent you the file,
- you copy/paste its content into a commit on this ticket without looking further, set the ticket to needs_review and added myself and four other people in CC.

So, what picture talking around a table should i interpret with what happened ?

1. you put a raw copy of an old unmaintained spkg on the git to move the process from discussion to action, and added all of us in CC so that we could work together on the migration, since Sage has some coding standards that were not satisfied by the bitrotting sage-25.spkg.

2. you did not read the developer manual and are not able to write packages stasfying medium standards, you do not care if custom files coming from an older version of the package (2.4) overwrite the newer ones, you do not care to implement self-tests while they exist, you consider the raw copy/paste as a perfectly valid commit ready for review.

3. you knows all those standards very well, but prefers the other to do all the checks during the review, but at the same time require them not to implement the changes on the ticket, but on an hidden branch.

I am very sorry that i interpreted what happened in the first constructive collective way and could not even think of some other possibilities, i will be far more careful next time and think that 2. or 3. could happen, but then my comment would have been "please do not waste reviewer's time by letting far-below-standards packaging into needs_rewiew". Or perhaps should i open a new ticket with the same purpose and a cleaner package so that the territories are respected ?

I don't know how you did to import my branch (e.g. `self-check`), but you forgot commit `e23db009d555c3cb3019e560ccd67bc4f5dd32de` that adds a missing `# optional - nauty` so that we can do `sage -t --optional=nauty`.

Concerning upstream tarball, the less we touch upstream source, the best it is. Here, we have the possibility to keep it intact (as done in `247b6a6d17aa9db788e73ab27f5966f3c08e0666`). It is much less intrusive to just rename `nauty25r9.tar.gz` into `nauty-25r9.tar.gz` (the file itself is untouched and we get the same hash than upstream) than to unpack it, change internal directory, and recompress it (which should require an additional `spkg-src`). See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#modified-tarballs

Why would you want to do that? I disagree with adding `# optional` tags unless strictly required.
