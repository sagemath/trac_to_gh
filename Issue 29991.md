At this stage we have the following contrast:


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', start_index=1)                  
....: X.<x,y> = M.chart()                            
....: E = M.vector_bundle(2, 'E')      
....: e = E.local_frame('e')      
....: v = M.vector_field('v')      
....: s = E.section('s')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IndexError: string index out of range
```


This simply comes from the fact that the method `section` does not like pure strings as input, in contrast to `vector_field` or `tensor`.
