Let's improve the installation-from-source documentation regarding the "recommended system packages" for 9.1.

- `build/pkgs/_recommended` - records additional recommended packages such as texlive-xetex (see https://wiki.sagemath.org/prerequisitesUbuntu)

(from #29124)

autoconf/automake are already in homebrew-bootstrap.txt

The other, yes.

The package `texlive-generic-extra` doesn't exist for ubuntu 20.04, and on 18.04 it was already labeled as "transitional dummy package". I'm not sure what's the correct replacement, maybe simply "texlive"?
