... to indicate its purpose and identity in a clearer way.  

(It has nothing to do with the `python3` that `configure --with-system-python3` is looking for in `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4`.)

After #29355, `sage-system-python` is only used during configure and build:

```

It works for me.

My only comments would be that the commit history of the proposed branch is quite ugly. A rebase on top of #29355 or on top of 9.3.beta0 won't hurt. Or maybe that branch serves already as a dependency for other branches?

Anyway, please change the status to positive review on my behalf if you have good reason to keep the commit history as it is, or update the branch and I will come back to it after the elections.
