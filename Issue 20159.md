Keywords: complex reflection group, cartan matrix

Implements the invariant form for complex, non-real reflection groups.

The implementation currently uses the Reynolds operator in Lemma 1.3 in Lehrer-Taylor, but I am asking to follow the Cartan matrix in Chapter 1.6, as we have the Cartan matrix already available.

I merged the implementation as is into #11187 since it does work properly in the real case (using the Cartan matrix) and in the complex case (using brute force).

I would then use this ticket to figure how to do the Cartan matrix version in the complex case.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

I now added the complete universal algorithm in all types (including non-irreducible and badly generated) and merged it into #11187.
