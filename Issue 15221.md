From the "make disclean" output:

```
find -name '*.pyc' | xargs rm -f
find: illegal option -- n
find: [-H | -L] path-list predicate-list
find -name '*.pyx' | sed 's/pyx$/c/' | xargs rm -f
find: illegal option -- n
find: [-H | -L] path-list predicate-list
find -name '*.pyx' | sed 's/pyx$/cpp/' | xargs rm -f
find: illegal option -- n
find: [-H | -L] path-list predicate-list
```
