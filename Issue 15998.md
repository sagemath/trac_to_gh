(it does not really depend on #16231, but the two are probably in conflict as the new MOLS_10_2 function must find its place in the MOLS constructor. And it will be much easier to update this patch than #16231)

Hi Nathann,

You messed up the last merge (commit 316b379). There is a huge block

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
...
=======
...
>>>>>>> 0f3a755de6b9d10b12067f00691f359f93a484fa
```


Try again!

On it `T_T`

If you feel bored while I do this (I rebased 10 branches one hour ago....) you can review #16286 ! It will become a dependency of this patch because of the MOLS table.

Hi Nathann,

You need to merge again with the last version of #16286 which has changed because of my review.

Hi Nathann,

In the first commit, I did the rebase.

In the following ones:
- I changed TD/MOLS to not raise an error when n=1 that you started to do in `orthogonal_array` (and add the appropriate doctests)... consequence: more MOLS are available!!!!!!
- I also changed the `availability` into `existence`

These changes look good to me too and all tests pass, soooooo unless you have something else to add to it this can get in too `:-)`
