Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11187

Original creator: stumpc5

Original creation time: 2011-04-13 15:07:49

Assignee: tbd

CC:  vripoll kdilks simonking jmichel hivert

Keywords: reflection group

This patch adds a function


```
sage: FiniteReflectionGroup(classification_type)
```


to work with finite (crystallographic, real, complex) reflection groups. It uses the data from GAP3/chevie.

Depends on #8327.

I've factored out the `CartanMatrix` class into #14137.

Comment by tscrim created at 2013-06-21 13:59:01

I've rebased the patch and noticed that this will likely depend on #10963. I'll post a new version once I completely untangle what is going on with #10963.

Changing keywords from "reflection group" to "reflection group, days49".

I always made some minor changes on this patch locally - I would actually only start working on this patch after you guys are finished with #10963. If you want to actively work on this patch, ping me again, and we can discuss what is still needed to finilize this patch.

Cheers, Christian

Hello Christian

Do you have a git branch for this ticket somewhere ? or should I try to resurrect the patch ?


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2014-07-01 02:36:25

> Do you have a git branch for this ticket somewhere ? or should I try to resurrect the patch ?

No, I don't. But I have a local old version of Sage containing that code and quite a bit more, so I wonder if I should/will try to organize it a bit and put it up here.

Do you need any from that code in particular (in which case I am more tempted to work on that), or is that just a general question?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2014-07-01 11:32:58

Hello, no, no real need for this code, just asking a general question. Now that #10963 is over.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2014-07-28 08:12:08

Here's a git version of this patch with changes necessary to get Sage to start (I did not run any tests, so I am not saying things are working). There might be other changes to the files in question which need to be moved over too. Just as a general note from doing the rebasing, there are a bunch of methods missing doctests.

Comment by SimonKing created at 2015-06-02 21:59:17

The current code gives

```
sage: C = ComplexReflectionGroups()
sage: C.Irreducible()
Category of complex reflection groups
sage: C.Irreducible() is C
True
```

Is that what you intended? Perhaps the "irreducible" axiom should be defined on `ComplexReflectionGroups().Finite()`, not on `ComplexReflectionGroups()`.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2015-06-02 22:22:14

To summarise the discussion Christian and I just had: I believe `WellGenerated` should be an axiom. Christian said that the general notion of well-generated is a bit tricky for infinite groups. Hence, he actually only wants to take into account well-generatedness for _finite_ complex reflection groups.

Hence, the aim would be to define `WellGeneratedComplexReflectionGroups` as application of an axiom to `ComplexReflectionGroups.Finite`. However, I believe that the name should contain the word "finite" if we really want to focus on finite well-generated groups. Alternatively, it should be implemented as a nested-nested class `WellGenerated` within the nested class `ComplexReflectionGroups.Finite`.

I also think that `WellGeneratedComplexReflectionGroups` should provide a parent method `_test_well_generated` that tests whether `self` is well-generated. Such method would automatically be executed when running the test suite.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2015-06-02 22:26:42

We have discussed already that in order to fix the `Irreducible` axiom, it is needed (in addition to the nested class) to have a `SubcategoryMethod` called `Irreducible`.

Note that if we define `WellGeneratedComplexReflectionGroups` as a sub-category of `ComplexReflectionGroups.Finite()`, we should probably remove its subcategory-methods `Finite` and `Irreducible`, since both axioms have already been defined in the super-category.


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2015-06-02 22:30:00

The iterators currently cache the list of all elements of the group. Is that (always) a good idea?


---

Comment by SimonKing created at 2015-06-02 23:22:50

After discussion with Christian, the iterator of a complex reflection group is a lot faster. What we did was to keep `._reduced_word` as a list, and only transform it into an actual word when needed (i.e., in the `.reduced_word()` method).

Before:

```
sage: G = ComplexReflectionGroup([2,1,4])
sage: %timeit L = list(G); G._elements=None
The slowest run took 6.02 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 66.4 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: G = ComplexReflectionGroup([2,1,4])
sage: %timeit L = list(G); G._elements=None
The slowest run took 66.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 5.56 ms per loop
```

Hi Christian,

This is not how the tests work:

```python
                def _test_well_generated(self, **options):
                    tester = self._tester(**options)
                    return self.is_well_generated()
```

Instead, do

```python
                def _test_well_generated(self, **options):
                    tester = self._tester(**options)
                    tester.assert_(self.is_well_generated())
```

or something similar.

* some doctests should be marked with `# optional - chevie` or whatever
* doctest continuation is now `....:` and not `...`
* raise statements should use py3 syntax `raise Error('message')`

`@`Simon and Nicolas: The category for complex reflection groups (with axioms finite/irreducible/well-generated) is now sort of ready. I would now like to make `ComplexReflectionGroups().Finite().WellGenerated()` a super category of `FiniteCoxeterGroups`.

* Is that what I should do?
* If I simply add a method `supercategories` to `FiniteCoxeterGroups`, its string repr changes in a not desired way. How should I treat that?

Thanks, Christian

It sounds more like you want to add `ComplexReflectionGroups().WellGenerated()` as a supercategory to `CoxeterGroups`, in particular to replace `Groups().FinitelyGenerated()` by `ComplexReflectionGroups().WellGenerated()`. I also think `ComplexReflectionGroups()` should be a subcategory of `Groups().FinitelyGenerated()` (otherwise the additional axiom should go on the supercategory for `CoxeterGroups()`). The finite part will take care of itself by the `CategoryWithAxiom` magic.

Hello Christian,
thanks for your hard work on this ticket. I have only had a quick look, so trivial remarks:
* not yet 100% coverage, I think (I have seen a few methods without examples)
* `TODO::` should be `.. TODO::`
* Could you please replace `Returns` by `Return` everywhere.
* Sometime the first line of the doc is made of two sentences. Please separate them as:

```
Return something.

Something is very very important.
```

* Please try to keep the lines 80 characters long.
* Bad alignement of EXAMPLES:: in `distinguished_reflection`, `distinguished_reflections`
* missing optional in `sage: W = CoxeterGroup(["A",4], implementation="chevie")`

And you should aim to have a green light from the patchbot. So far, this has *never* been the case.

I am aware of the stuff to do in the documentation, but before getting there (or, at least, in parallel, I'll fix your complaints now), I try to get the overall setting right (this includes the category framework, the interaction with other reflection group classes, and the dependence of chevie).

> And you should aim to have a green light from the patchbot. So far, this has *never* been the case.

I'd like to get it green, but it has not run in 5 days, and I can only fix stuff the patchbot complaints about if I see its results regularly after uploading a new commit sequence (a patchbot that doesn't run soon after uploading doesn't really help during a coding sprint)...

Thanks again, Christian

There are many patchbots, but only one that has added all your participants to its trust list (_at my demand_). This one is currently not active. You can try to contact some active patchbots owners to ask them to trust the participants (see http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot/owners and http://patchbot.sagemath.org/machines). Or run your own patchbot.

Oh, I didn't know that **all** participants must be on the trust list, I thought it was only the submitter of the branch - I gonna try to get a patchbot running...


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-06-17 08:18:00

Yes, this comes from some difficulty to identify the true authors of the code..

Comment by kdilks created at 2015-06-17 21:05:09

I just started a patchbot recently, and I believe I now have it configured to trust all relevant participants and prioritize this ticket.

First run through wasn't very helpful, since I don't have Chevie installed. Though presumably everything should be marked with some kind of optional tag so that tests are skipped if Chevie isn't installed.

I'm in the process of trying to install Chevie, and if I succeed, I'll have it do another run.


---

Comment by kdilks created at 2015-06-18 10:04:12

I have Gap3/Chevie installed now.

It's probably easier (and a lot faster) to run

`./sage -t ./src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_complex.py` ,

and if things are crashing and you need to see where, then do

`./sage -t --verbose ./src/sage/combinat/root_system/reflection_group_complex.py` .

Patchbots are good for finding merge conflicts with new betas and seeing if you unintentionally broke other parts of Sage, but at this point I think it's sufficient to only test the one file you're changing with this ticket.

After playing around for a bit, something seems to be broken with the iterator. The example `W = ReflectionGroup((1,1,3))` (should be isomorphic to S3) included as a test works fine, but if I try `W = ReflectionGroup((3,1,1))` (should be isomorphic to cyclic group of order 3) then it keeps printing out the three elements in a never-ending loop.

When adding new files, you should follow [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files), in particular use the correct license statement.

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2015-06-18 10:14:24

Thanks for having a look here! I am currently working (since yesterday) on speeding the iteration through the group, I hope I have gotten somewhere later today...

I guess I must tag each and every test as

```
# optional - chevie
```

which means that these tests are not run on patchbots per default, or do they run if the patchbot has chevie installed?

Not literally every test, there are probably tests which do not require `chevie`.

> do they run if the patchbot has chevie installed?

They would be run if the Sage optional package `chevie` is installed. However, such a package does not exist.

Replying to [comment:97 jdemeyer]:

Every test (except for the creation of the category of complex reflection groups) handle with reflection groups (no surprise), and even initializing such a group requires `chevie`.

But within finite time, I will work on making some core functionalities work without having `chevie` installed.

> They would be run if the Sage optional package `chevie` is installed. However, such a package does not exist.

Is that a problem? Should there be a possibility of installing `chevie` as an optional package? I update the description of this ticket to explain how to get chevie installed in a system. See #8906 for old stuff about that.

It's not a problem for me or for this ticket. I guess it is a problem if people want to use the code that you are writing here, since getting `chevie` to work within Sage is non-trivial.

Okay, got 100% coverage and all tests passing! But I wouldn't know how to get the startup module green as I turned the `ComplexReflectionGroups` category into a super category of `CoxeterGroups` which is loaded on startup.


---

Comment by kdilks created at 2015-06-18 17:15:44

I have a failing doctest for `is_regular`. There's not a problem with the `is_regular` method, but for `W = ReflectionGroup(23)`, there are two elements where my computer returns a different reduced word than expected ( https://www.diffchecker.com/ewvevrda ). I consistently get the same different answer. Are you using the older/more stable gap-jm4, or the latest gap-jm5 ?

Unrelated, but I also can't get the long_element() method to work.

Replying to [comment:104 kdilks]:

> reduced word than expected

This computation is currently done purely in my code, and it's not related to `chevie`. The iterator comes from `_iterator_tracking_words` so let's see what happens there.

Related here, and indeed also to your question on `long_element`, observe that currently

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(23); W
Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 3 and type H3
sage: W.category()
Join of Category of finite permutation groups and Category of irreducible finite coxeter groups
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['H',3]); W
Irreducible real reflection group of rank 3 and type H3
sage: W.category()
Join of Category of finite permutation groups and Category of irreducible finite coxeter groups
```


Since the iter algorithm for coxeter groups is slightly smarter (it takes into account that the weak order is graded), the two iter functions are different.

But:

* both iter functions are supposed to return the same iteration through the group
* both iter functions should always return the elements in the very same order (in contrary to what we see on my vs on your machine)

I found a bug (having a `set` rather than a `list` in one spot), so let's see if this is fixed with my next push in a few minutes after all tests pass here.

> Unrelated, but I also can't get the long_element() method to work.

The reason is, that you constructed the real group as a complex group, so the long element for `ReflectionGroup(['H',3])` works while it currently doesn't work for `ReflectionGroup(23)`. I do have to fix that and be more careful constructing the right class instance.

Sure, but it is limited to finite _real_ reflection groups, while I certainly want to work with real and with complex reflection groups. E.g., the results in
* http://jlms.oxfordjournals.org/content/90/3/919.abstract (paywall)
* http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2789 (free)
were only possible by using the code in this ticket to work in Sage with complex reflection groups from chevie through the gap3 interface.

Concerning the iteration through elements without keeping them in memory, we have to benchmark agains

```
    gap> i:=0;;
    gap> W:=CoxeterGroup("E",7);;
    gap> ForEachElement(W,function(x)i:=i+1; 
    > if i mod 1000000=0 then Print("*\c");fi;
    > end);Print("\n");
    **
```

which takes about a second per million elements, see https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jean.michel/gap3/htm/chap075.htm.

One of the thoughts I'm bouncing around is doing a full C/C++ version using arrays, and then using Cython (mainly `PermutationGroupElement`) as a transfer layer to Sage/GAP. In which case it probably should be split off as a little specialized spkg.

That is quite an impressive speedup. I know a little bit about build systems (and its on my todo to learn more for fixing up coxeter3/LiE too), but, e.g., Jeroen or François are good people to ask. Although if you need GCC 5.x, then we will need to do some changes to Sage. Yet, I think moving to GCC 5.x is something that we want and are going to do soon...

This is very similar to what I did. The idea is that if you want large performance, you need to completely control the way you use the memory. So what I did is to build in parallel a large linked list of arrays and then thanks to Cython I returns Sage an iterator which is a view on this list which wrap the element of the linked list into proper Sage Element.

For the record: as discussed last night, the first goal would be to separate the category stuff into its own ticket (`@`tscim is working on this), and then to get the present version well documented, tested, and finished. Only after this work is done, we will start improving stuff and add functionality.

To this end, we have to:
* get the category stuff right
* test properly that reducible groups work as desired
* test properly that the labelling system of simples/hyperplanes/reflections works properly
* test that the assumptions on how we obtain the data from chevie is correct (one example here is that the code tries to get n simple reflections, N* distinguished reflections, and then the remaining (N-N*) other reflections when listing all reflections. This has to be rechecked, but there are plenty of more similar examples.

`@`trscim: For the record, the timings for iteration in E7 seem to be odd:

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['E',7])                                              
sage: %time for w in W.iteration(algorithm="depth",tracking_words=False): pass  
CPU times: user 3.71 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.71 s
Wall time: 3.79 s
sage: %time for w in W.iteration(algorithm="breadth",tracking_words=False): pass
CPU times: user 8.72 s, sys: 4.84 ms, total: 8.73 s
Wall time: 8.72 s
sage: %time for w in W.iteration(algorithm="depth",tracking_words=True): pass   
CPU times: user 5.83 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 5.83 s
Wall time: 5.81 s
sage: %time for w in W.iteration(algorithm="breadth",tracking_words=True): pass 
CPU times: user 20.6 s, sys: 67.4 ms, total: 20.6 s
Wall time: 20.7 s
```

Also, I discussed with Nicolas yesterday, and (as what I said on the weekend), we are back at the situation that one can be much smarter concerning the ascents: Let i be an ascent of w and si and s_j commute. Then i is also an ascent of wsj. I will try to use that today, but it still seems that any test in this direction is much slower than doing the actual test for an ascent the way we already do it.

Travis, could you have a look at the diffset 8497f5d; I commented out that the change is actually used, see `#for i in self.noncom[first]`, it seems to slow down the test even though much less is actually tested. Maybe you see how to get rid of the overhead the line `for i in self.noncom[first]` has compared to `for i in range(first+1,self.n)`.


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-04-13 10:33:26

Travis: Also, you introduced `_reduced_word` to be a lazy attribute. This has a few drawbacks: `not self._reduced_word is None` in the length function in `reflection_group_real.py` is never triggered, and `_reduced_word` is now either a word in the index set (if the lazy attribute is triggered in the real case), or a word in `range(n)` if one has gotten it through the iterator. This way, the method `reduced_word` in the real case is always executed, even though the reduced word is already known.

Two solutions are:
* either set `_reduced_word` to a word in the indices in the iterator for the cost of list lookups for each letter in the word
* write the lazy attribute in the real case so that it gives a word in `range(n)`
* do neither and forget about the info gotten from the iterator in the real case.

My guess is because Cython is smart enough to translate

```python
for i in range(n)
```

into

```c
for(i=0; i<n; ++i)
```

whereas for the other, it is iterating over some object (which, a priori, may not even be iterable). In more detail, Cython doesn't even know that it is iterating over a list, just that `self.noncom` is. Try:

```python
        nc = self.noncom[first]
        for i in nc:
```

or the variant

```python
        nc = self.noncom[first]
        k = len(nc)
        for dummy in range(k):
            i = nc[dummy]
```

where you have `cdef list nc` and `cdef int dummy, k` (although I suspect the former of these is faster).

Doing this simplified the code and probably got us a small speedup. Yet, this is a bug in my implementation.  However, I'm not sure how much it is worth it to compute the length of an arbitrary element without computing its reduced word. If it becomes that time critical for someone, we can get them an `algorithm` option for `length()`.

> This way, the method `reduced_word` in the real case is always executed, even though the reduced word is already known.

This doesn't make sense. If anything `reduced_word()` will throw an error if `_reduced_word` was done by the `lazy_attribute`. The iterator overwrites (the lazy attribute) `_reduced_word` if the word comes from there, so it does not get computed twice. Otherwise it was a user created word and will never be identical (not just equals) to an element created from the iterator.

> Two solutions are:
> * write the lazy attribute in the real case so that it gives a word in `range(n)`

This is what I would do. Although we might be better off just doing our own implementation using a list (which we mutate) and starting with `self.domain()`.

One big issue that is still waiting for me to fix it is that it remains unclear if we want a left or right action. The implementation is a left action, but e.g. #20402 assumes a right action. I will get to this before the weekend and would then hope for the code to become stable and some final reviewing :-)


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-04-13 15:43:13

Just FYI - you have reverted a python3 compatible change with this:

```diff
-                ....:     print('%s %s'%(w.reduced_word(), w.is_regular(W.coxeter_number())))
+                ....:     print w.reduced_word(), w.is_regular(h)
```

I think `2to3` can handle this, but I'm just stating a paranoia about it.

Although I would advocate for making doctests that avoid printing through an iteration altogether (really annoying failures when the iteration order changes), but this isn't really a big issue.

I will take a more detailed look at the recent changes before the weekend.

How much additional code would it take to make it work on both sides, allowing the user to do `ReflectionGroup(..., action="right")`?

I am sure there are reasons for that python3 convention, but I do prefer simple to read code. Anyway, I can also do the other if you prefer.

I was afraid you'd ask that. in my eyes: too much. The elements are considered as permutations, words, and matrices at the same time (and there are even two types of words, in simples and in all reflections, and the simple words have wired properties in the non-real case), making options would pollute the code just soo much, I think, and would introduce so many possible mistakes. I prefer to have clean and fast code, that is hopefully getting better than chevie, eventually. Once that is achieved, I am getting in favour with adding another layer of user friendliness.

Fair enough: let's focus on getting things to work.

One thing though is that a lot of features are completely symmetric
(e.g. the reverse of a word is a word). The only spot where things
differ is when there is an explicit action. In my experience when
implementing representations of semigroups, it was often possible to
abstracted everything out by manipulating elements in the code as
functions whenever there is an action involved (sorry, I know, this is
a big vague).

Of course, a prerequisite for implementing this seamlessly is that
permutation groups themselves would allow for both left and right
actions.

Cheers,
                                        Nicolas

In python3, `print` becomes an actual function, so it needs the parentheses (which due to Python's handling of parentheses, `print(foo)` gets evaluated to `print foo`, but having a comma means `(foo, bar)` becomes a tuple). So to help make the doctests 2/3 compatible and to ease the eventual transition, I do prefer the way I had it or make it into a few examples and have a doctest which does check everything (without verbose).

> FYI - Patchbots seem happy with it.

yes, but it didn't test the gap3 stuff again (I just asked Frederic how to get the patchbot to also test those), and also we still have two new startup modules (though the patchbot sees them without indicating it, see http://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/11187/Ubuntu/14.04/x86_64/3.13.0-85-generic/librae/2016-04-20%2010:00:02?plugin=plugins.startup_modules&diff=/log/0/Ubuntu/14.04/x86_64/3.13.0-85-generic/librae/2016-04-12%2018%3A16%3A59&ticket=11187&base=7.2.beta4)

To now run the doctests `# optional - gap3`, it seems I cannot use the patchbot anymore. Should I then do instead

```
sage-patchbot/sage -tp 4 --all --long --optional=gap3
```

myself?

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-04-20 15:19:27

I think that will be best. I was going to try this afternoon to see if I can avoid importing those categories at startup, but I might not be successful at it.

I'd use `--optional=gap3,sage`

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-04-20 20:49:26

To remove `generalized_coxeter_groups.py` from the startup would either require making it a lazy import in `coxeter_groups.py` or making `coxeter_groups.py` not being imported at startup. I think the better strategy is to leave things how they are as an incentive to have `coxeter_groups.py` not be imported at startup. (Also it is only a net +1 imported at startup.)

I also copied the other optional from the patchbot:

```
./sage -tp 6 --all --long --optional=ccache,gap3,mpir,patchbot,python2,sage
```

`@`Frederic, is that what I should do? Would it be hard (desirable?) to tell the patchbot (maybe in `config_file.json`) which optional tests should in general be run?

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-04-21 13:44:10

I fixed the errors in `combinat/root_system/coxeter_group.py` (to which, we should be able to do most (all) of that functionality without appealing to GAP3 and we should probably fold that into `(Irreducible)RealReflectionGroup` at some point). The latter errors are indicating issues with the interface, so I would just wait on those until we do #20393. Since `gap3` is an experimental package, we are not strictly required to have all `# optional - gap3` doctests pass.

Right, good catch. I'm going to try and find the precise error that gets raised, but I've pushed a hack fix for now.

It only throws an `AttributeError`, and I have changed it to catch only that.

Hi travis, 

Can you send me the log of the `map_reduce.py` error ? On what kinds of machine was it ? Is it reproducible ?
