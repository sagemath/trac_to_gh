CC:  sage-combinat hivert simonking tscrim aschilling bump

Up to now, CombinatorialFreeModule elements used the (horrible)
default implementation of __hash__ provided by Element which uses the
string representation. This was slow! And further fragile! Indeed, the
string representation depends on a sorting of the support of the
elements.  In #14102 we got bitten by this with elements whose support
mixed int's, Integer's and string. The result of:

```
    sage: sorted([int(0), 'delta', 1])
    [0, 1, 'delta']
```

depends on the platform (that's ok) but also on which of 0 and 1 are
int's or Integer, whereas the corresponding lists test as equal.
This led to equal element with distinct hash values.

This ticket adds an implementation of `__hash__` inspired from that
proposed for frozendicts in PEP 0416. In particular this
implementation does not rely on sorting.

Some timings:

```
    sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
    sage: B = F.basis()
    sage: f = B['a'] + 3*B['c']
    sage: %timeit hash(f)                         # new hash function
    100000 loops, best of 3: 3.57 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit hash(f._repr_())                # equivalent to the previous one
    10000 loops, best of 3: 85 µs per loop
```


There used to be a custom hash function for ambient space elements in
root systems, but this is not needed anymore:

```
    sage: F = RootSystem(['A',2]).ambient_space()
    sage: f = F.simple_root(0)
    sage: %timeit hash(f)                         # new hash function
    100000 loops, best of 3: 3.63 µs per loop
    sage: %timeit hash(f._repr_())                # equivalent to the previous one
    10000 loops, best of 3: 42.3 µs per loop
```

Apparently, yes; here is the timing after adding a `@`cached_method:

```
    sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, ['a','b','c'])
    sage: B = F.basis()
    sage: f = B['a'] + 3*B['c']
    sage: %timeit hash(f) 
    1000000 loops, best of 3: 582 ns per loop
```


It's almost an order of magnitude faster (more with larger elements), assuming we often recompute the hash value of elements.
Do we want to do this?

Glad to see that the decorator is useful on magical Python methods (by the way, `__len__` and so on can now be cached as well).

> Do we want to do this?

I guess I am biased... ;-) (take that as "yes, from my viewpoint")

It reminds me, though, that I should investigate a potentially nasty detail. Assume that `@`cached_method is applied to the hash. Then an instance `O` is created, that has the hash `h1`. Then we save `O`. Later, the `__hash__` is changed, so that a newly created copy of `O` should have hash `h2!=h1`. Would it be the case that *reloading* `O` from the old pickle still has `hash(O)==h1`, i.e., would the old hash value be part of the pickle? This would be bad.

Since `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement` are already large objects dict(index, coeff)) the size of a cached methods without any arguments seems to be 128 byte on a 64bits machine as of Sage 6.1.1. It probably could be lowered (Simon: do you have any idea ?). I'm tempted to say: add the cached method by default.

For the info, here are the Cython struct of a `CachedMethodNoArgs`:

```
cdef class CachedFunction(object):
    cdef public str __name__
    cdef public str __module__
    cdef object _argument_fixer
    cdef public object _fix_to_pos
    cdef public object f
    # cache is not always of type "dict"!
    cdef public object cache
    cdef tuple _default_key
    cdef bint is_classmethod

cdef class CachedMethodCallerNoArgs(CachedFunction):
    cdef public object _instance
```
 
Simon: Wouldn't be possible to replace some attributes such as `__name__`, `__module__` which are seldom used by a slower property ?

Hopefully I have been through all the failing doctests. Anne, Travis, Dan, please check them!

Using pprint makes the order depend on the comparison function of free module elements rather than their hash, which should be more robust.

Well, I get a bunch of other failures in the dev scripts, but those also fail for me on the current branch develop; so I assume they are unrelated.

Shoot; I don't have a 32bits machine under hand, and I was hoping the hash value on 32bits would be the hash value on 64bits mod 2^32.
