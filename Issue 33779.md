# Issue 33779: improve pycodestyle in 4 files in graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34016

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2022-06-18 17:33:01

We fix most issues raised by `./sage -tox -e pycodestyle -- src/sage/graphs/matchpoly.pyx src/sage/graphs/mcqd.pyx src/sage/graphs/orientations.py src/sage/graphs/partial_cube.py` except some missing white spaces around operators (E225) related to pointers and bitwise operations.
