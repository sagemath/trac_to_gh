# Issue 25561: Same frequency table gives different Huffman encoding table.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @AntGeorge

Original creation time: 2018-07-07 23:37:08

Keywords: Huffman

Way to reproduce:


```sage
sage: from sage.coding.source_coding.huffman import Huffman
sage: a = {'120': 1, '167': 1, '17': 1, '75': 1, '98': 2, '99': 1}
sage: b = a.copy()
sage: H1 = Huffman(a)
sage: H2 = Huffman(b)
sage: H1.encoding_table() == H2.encoding_table()
False
```


Sage version:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 7.5.1, Release Date: 2017-01-15'
```


I think the problem is with **enumerate** and **items** calls inside the **_build_code** function of Huffman class because there is no a standard order of the elements.

For a given frequency distribution, Huffman code is not unique.
May be you are expecting a [canonical Huffman code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code) ?

Oh ok, it's my fault.

However, is there any way to re-create the same Huffman code from the existing Huffman object?

Maybe should i replace the **_tree** and the **_index** of the new object, it is right?

Thanks.

I don't understand what you want to do. You should ask on https://ask.sagemath.org/, it's the right place for such questions.
