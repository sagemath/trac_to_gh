Does this patch have a dependency on #10630 and maybe something else? Something is wrong because I get errors.
One of the tests `from sage.combinat.matrix_type import primitives` I get the error:
`ImportError: No module named matrix_type`

I don't even know where to look for these.  Can someone point me to the right patches and maybe how to even look this up myself?

I was working with Armi on this patch and we forgot to run sync-build after changing the name of the file (hence this was still there as a compiled file). Here's the small review patch which fixes this.

And the dependency?  I am right about this, right?

I don't think so...but it's better safe than sorry.

I will be adding some new methods and functions which get used frequently with these classes.
