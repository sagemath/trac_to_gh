Attachment [sagemath.desktop](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket22599/sagemath.desktop) by @kiwifb created at 2017-03-14 10:18:51

I have one as well in sage-on-gentoo, I wonder if the other have one:

```
[Desktop Entry]
		Name=Sage Shell
		Type=Application
		Comment=Math software for abstract and numerical computations
		Exec=sage
		TryExec=sage
		Icon=sage
		Categories=Education;Science;Math;
		Terminal=true
```

Because yours starts the notebook, I am not sure it actually needs a terminal.

Yup, i have one as well on Sage Debian Live :) Actually, one for the command line


```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Sage console
Name[fr]=Console Sage
Name[en]=Sage console
Comment=Scientific Computing using Sage
Comment[fr]=Calcul scientifique avec Sage
Comment[en]=Scientific Computing using Sage
Exec=x-terminal-emulator -T "SAGE" -e "sage"
Icon=/opt/sagemath/files/sage-console.icon.svg
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Education;Math;Science;
StartupNotify=true
```


one for the Sage notebook (we need to launch it from a terminal since it asks for a password the first time):


```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Sage notebook
Name[fr]=Notebook Sage
Name[en]=Sage notebook
Comment=Scientific Computing using Sage
Comment[fr]=Calcul scientifique avec Sage
Comment[en]=Scientific Computing using Sage
Exec=x-terminal-emulator -T "SAGE NOTEBOOK LAUNCHER" -e "sage -notebook=sagenb"
Icon=/opt/sagemath/files/sage-notebook.icon.svg
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Education;Math;Science;
StartupNotify=true
```



and one for the jupyter notebook:



```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Jupyter notebook with Sage
Name[fr]=Notebook Jupyter avec Sage
Name[en]=Jupyter notebook with Sage
Comment=Scientific Computing using Jupyter notebook and Sage
Comment[fr]=Calcul scientifique avec le notebook Jupyter et Sage

Sagemath notebook can take quite long to open, so terminal is useful for seeing progress.

Also I guess students are more likely to leave stray processes around on lab machines (they tend to log out with all their windows still open).

However, I have tested with Terminal=false and that works fine takes couple of seconds to open on Intel i5-3 CPU with 16G RAM.

Also the first time you launch sage notebook you need to enter a password in the terminal.

I just tested and closing a browser tab with sage notebook does not stop the sage notebook process.
I think this is good enough reason to keep the Terminal=true.
