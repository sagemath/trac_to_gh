In SageMath 9.3.beta3:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = Qq(3).extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: (x^2 + 1).base_extend(K).roots()
[(a + O(3^20), 1),
 (2*a + 2*a*3 + 2*a*3^2 + 2*a*3^3 + 2*a*3^4 + 2*a*3^5 + 2*a*3^6 + 2*a*3^7 + 2*a*3^8 + 2*a*3^9 + 2*a*3^10 + 2*a*3^11 + 2*a*3^12 + 2*a*3^13 + 2*a*3^14 + 2*a*3^15 + 2*a*3^16 + 2*a*3^17 + 2*a*3^18 + 2*a*3^19 + O(3^20),
  1)]
sage: (x^2 + 1).roots(K)  # should return the same as above
[]
```
