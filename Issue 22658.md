this removes one of our patches, has more vectorisation, and in view of work on #22799 it's better to work with the latest release, to be in sync with numpy devs.

The upgrade to numpy is included as part of #22582, which is already positively reviewed. So I propose to close this as a duplicate.

sure, no problem --- finding out that #22582 does a numpy update wasn't really possible.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
