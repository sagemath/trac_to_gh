Hello,

What is the point of modifying `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst`, `src/sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx`, `src/sage/numerical/linear_functions.pyx` and `src/sage/numerical/mip.pyx` in the same commit?

Vincent

Without these changes some doctests will fail because the line number changed from 839 to 840.

It's common to write `...` instead of the line number.
