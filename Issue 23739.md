Sometimes, `giacpy_sage` doctests can run out of memory. This happens on systems with many cores because too many threads are started. Analogous to #23713, the number of threads should be limited by `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23976

So now the default giacsettings.threads is SAGE_NUM_THREADS or 1 if failed to import.

Some linear algebra tutorial is added in the libgiac doc and a _setitem_ function was  added.
