#14550 creates a new thematic tutorial in German for teachers. In the present state, it seems inaccessible from the notebook documentation. I am not sure it would be built on the website either ( at http://www.sagemath.org/de/ ), but that would be very desirable to attract outside visitors.

But apparently the various thematic tutorials are not available from the notebook, that is correct.
