The exact upstream commit does not apply, as it is few dozens commits later than our MPIR. So it needs rebasing. 
The difference between the rebased upstream commit and this patch is as follows:

```
+-   MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD)
++   MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD|SunOS)
```


So you may try removing this chunk, if you must...

In turn, the upstream commit is merging my pull request:
https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/347
which was addressing the same sort of issue on FreeBSD.
And indeed it was needed to go from `MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin)` to
`MINGW*|CYGWIN*|Darwin|FreeBSD)` in the very same place.

Yes but it serves a different purpose. The commit message is only relevant at the time of merging the commit for example. It doesn't reflect possible future insights.

On FreeBSD ldconfig does not accept the option `-n`, it needs `-m` or something like this. 
That's why it's necessary to special-case FreeBSD.
