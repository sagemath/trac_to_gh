More precisely, one could keep the alert, but make it so that it can *not* appear if it already appeared in the last 5 seconds (say).  It is so annoying!

The "2.0" thing to do is to inject a div somewhere, and just keep sending interrupts to the server until it works or the interrupt process gets cancelled.

"Couldn't immediately interrupt.  Trying again in (seconds 'till next retry) [cancel] [restart worksheet]"

[x] <- is a button that says x.

Is this a high priority issue? I am not convinced and since there is no patch and no sign of anyone working on fixing this I am bumping this to 3.4.2.

Good catch.

The point of #7702 is not to interrupt uninterruptible calculations, but to recognize that a calculation cannot be interrupted and display an appropriate alert.

>  * When we do show the alert (with #7702's example or a different one), maybe we should add, e.g., "Please try again in a few seconds.  If that doesn't work, please try restarting the worksheet."?
