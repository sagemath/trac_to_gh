ironically, it does not work on gentoo Lunix with gcc 5.4.0.

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 118.6 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```

and two more brial-related errors.
While numerous

```
warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]
```
 
are probably OK, 

```

It could also be that we must switch to gcc 6. Can you check in what Linux configuration this works for you?

(meahwhile I'll do distclean and a full rebuild, just to see if this still persists)
