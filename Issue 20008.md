The following code illustrates the problem. Note that there is a 5<sup>2</sup>-term right before O(5<sup>2</sup>).

```
sage: R = ZpCA(5,4)
print R(3,2) + R(5^3,4)
3 + 4*5^2 + O(5^2)
```

The fix is straightforward and the new doctest checks for this being resolved. All tests passed, so I am giving it a positive review.
