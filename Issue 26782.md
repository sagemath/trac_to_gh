# Issue 26782: BooleanMonomial 1 is not equal to Integer(1)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27019

Original creator: rburing

Original creation time: 2019-01-04 14:00:52

Keywords: BooleanMonomial, monomial, equality

Demonstration:


```
sage: P.<x> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: list(P(1))
[1]
sage: list(P(1))[0]
1
sage: list(P(1))[0] == 1
False
sage: type(list(P(1))[0])
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanMonomial'>
```


Note that this behavior is inconsistent with the behavior for polynomial rings over finite fields:


```
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2))
sage: list(R(1))[0] == 1
True
```


In the context of converting polynomials to lists, this has [understandably caused confusion for at least one user on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44880/sage-not-detecting-intergers-in-boolean-polynomial-ring/).

Part of the problem is that `BooleanMonomialMonoid` is a *monoid* and not a *ring*.

So there cannot be a coercion from `ZZ` to the `BooleanMonomialMonoid`. There could be a coercion to the common parent `P` but that requires a pushout construction...

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
