Interesting, I would think the original here

```diff
-    if scale == 'semilogy' or scale == 'semilogx':
+    if scale in ('semilogy', 'semilogx'):
```

would be faster than the change (and IMHO, the original is more readable). Well, I can see the change as being considered more pythonic. So LGTM.
