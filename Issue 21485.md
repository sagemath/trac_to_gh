Currently, `gap3` does not build. This branch fixes it.

It also uses the standard patching procedure and it no longer copies the content of `build/pkgs/gap3` to the install directory.

Thanks for fixing this! Could you tell why it stopped working? Is it a change how to patch packages?

I think it has to do with some of the recent changes to the build system that Jeroen, Erik, and Matthias have been doing. Anyways, positive review.
