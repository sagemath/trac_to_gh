Inputting a dynamical system with a non-endomorphism results in a non-implemented error for rational preimages of a point -- it should return the subscheme of preimages. 

This gives the non-implemented error, but Sage already knows the subscheme: 

P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
f=DynamicalSystem_projective([xˆ2-yˆ2,yˆ2-zˆ2,xˆ2-zˆ2])
q=P([1,0,1])
f.rational_preimages(q)
