1. It doesn't print a usage message when the script is just run:

```

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.
Be sure to exit when you are done and do not do anything
with other copies of Sage!

(sage subshell) sage:base wstein$ ./json_bundle.py
SAGE_ROOT=/mnt/usb1/scratch/wstein/sage-4.8-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux
```

There should have been a usage message detailing the options.  

2. There really are no tests at all of this.  The ticket #3052 where it was introduced talked about the challenge of writing tests, but then seemed to conclude with totally giving up.  This is not acceptable.  I'm totally opposed to ever introducing code into Sage that does anything useful if it doesn't have tests.  If it isn't, tested then it will definitely be broken soon enough.  This is exactly the sort of code that is likely to break too, due to Mercurial making some format change, us switching away from Mercurial etc.  With no tests, the brokeness of this code could go unnoticed even if we switched all of sage to git. 

3. The name bundle.json for the JSON hg repo could clash with an existing file, and is confusing, since it doesn't mention hg at all.  It would be much better to use .hg_bundle.json, since by starting with ".hg" it's clear it is something that is reserved for Mercurial usage. 

4. This code needs to be refactored.  A bare minimum functionality for this should have been something like:

```
$ sage -hg_text_expand .hg
# produce .hg_bundle.json
$ sage -hg_text_collapse .hg_bundle.json
# create .hg or give an error if .hg is there.
```

Then the other functionality could be built on that.  As it is, just doing the conversion either way runs a bunch of code in the middle of a for loop (over spkg's).  Currently the most basic functionality (which could be easily tested) is obfuscated; if it were available other people could easily build tools on top of it to do what they need (e.g., with their own hg repos). 

5. A serious issue with this patch is that it seems to already be totally broken.  Just take the sage-4.8 tarball, extract it, and type "make text-expand".  What happens is:

```

```

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but there are no directions, and if one can't just do "make text-expand" from a bare tarball, then there should be an immediate error message to that effect. 

6. Looking at the source code, I'm concerned about whether or not *every* .hg repo (e.g., even the base repo) is actually changed to JSON when "make text-expand" is run.    This is just a concern.  I do note that after doing "make text-expand" the hg repo in $SAGE_ROOT is gone, with nothing in its place.  Not happy about that (maybe this is caused by everything going to hell above):

```

Good morning and happy Chinese New Year from Singapore! Thanks for making this followup ticket, as my code could certainly be improved.

The main reason I didn't explain the command line usage of `json_bundle.py` anywhere is that it was not really meant to be used by the user - the interface to this code was to have been through `make text-expand` and `make text-collapse`. The only reason there are command line arguments at all is that I thought someone might want to expand on the functionality of the .py file later. But certainly you're right that putting an explanation in anyway helps anyone who is trying to debug or modify the code, and it improves modularity do so as well.

Looking at your new code, minor comment about exceptions:


```python
# this is legacy syntax which is removed in Python 3
raise ExceptionType, "message"
except ExceptionType, e
# this is the currently recommended syntax
raise ExceptionType("message")
except ExceptionType as e
```


I see a lot of the former syntax in Sage. The Python website tells me that "well-written 2.x code can be a lot like 3.x code", meaning, I guess, that much of the Python 3 syntax is already standard in 2.6 and 2.7 and we should use it. So I usually try to do this, but maybe it's too early to start planning for Python 3 in Sage? After all we only just got 2.7 in in Sage 5.0.

Anyway, you said you're going to work on this yourself, but if you want me to help with anything just let me know. I'll be keeping an eye on this ticket.

Hi,

I wrote this script hg_json, which does something very useful standalone -- it swaps between having a .hg directory and having a .hg.json file.    The hard work is all done by the code you had already written.

Thoughts?

I hope not to work much more on this ticket, and that you (Kini) could somehow finish it.  We need to come up with a workflow.  Maybe can have an option to sdist, e.g.,


```
sage -sdist --paranoid
```


which replaces all .hg repos by .hg.json files... for now (maybe removes binaries, e.g., that gfortran spkg), and when someday we switch to git, it will do the analogous thing.   Then Sage's own build system will be smart enough to deal with the .hg.json files, so that a tarball built using --paranoid will build fine with *no* further changes.   Now, *that* would be nice, right?

archive/issue_comments_141732.json:
```json
{
    "body": "git has a beautiful command called `fast-export` which does exactly what we want, and is a lot better and more robust than my code. `git fast-export --all > filename` will produce a text file containing all commit data (\"commits\"), file data (\"blobs\"), filename data (\"trees\"), pointers (\"refs\"), and pointer movement history (\"the reflog\") in a human-readable format. `git fast-import < filename` performed on an empty repository will reproduce the original repository.\n\n`fast-export` is more thorough than my code, which only exports the first three of the five things I listed above, and loses the other two - not that we are using refs (\"bookmarks\" in Mercurial) or reflogs (not existent in Mercurial afaik) to do anything in Sage at the moment. Also, while my code just attempts to make human-readable the deltas between changesets, `fast-export` actually dumps every separate version of every file in the repository, which is I guess more \"readable\" (though this also results in much larger output). This is actually the natural way to do things in git, because git's most abstract conception of the repository actually does contain every separate version of every file, whereas Mercurial's level of abstraction is lower and stops at deltas between changesets.\n\nIf you plan on switching to git anytime soon, I recommend we just drop this ticket for now and work on getting `fast-export` into our build scripts instead. We already have a git-based Sage library repository; I can make analogous ones for the scripts, extcode, and root repos, though it's probably a good idea to have a long hard think about how we can consolidate our repos as much as possible, as the switch from hg to git would be the ideal time to do massive history rewriting (which git is good at, by the way, using `git filter-branch`).

git has a beautiful command called `fast-export` which does exactly what we want, and is a lot better and more robust than my code. `git fast-export --all > filename` will produce a text file containing all commit data ("commits"), file data ("blobs"), filename data ("trees"), pointers ("refs"), and pointer movement history ("the reflog") in a human-readable format. `git fast-import < filename` performed on an empty repository will reproduce the original repository.

`fast-export` is more thorough than my code, which only exports the first three of the five things I listed above, and loses the other two - not that we are using refs ("bookmarks" in Mercurial) or reflogs (not existent in Mercurial afaik) to do anything in Sage at the moment. Also, while my code just attempts to make human-readable the deltas between changesets, `fast-export` actually dumps every separate version of every file in the repository, which is I guess more "readable" (though this also results in much larger output). This is actually the natural way to do things in git, because git's most abstract conception of the repository actually does contain every separate version of every file, whereas Mercurial's level of abstraction is lower and stops at deltas between changesets.

If you plan on switching to git anytime soon, I recommend we just drop this ticket for now and work on getting `fast-export` into our build scripts instead. We already have a git-based Sage library repository; I can make analogous ones for the scripts, extcode, and root repos, though it's probably a good idea to have a long hard think about how we can consolidate our repos as much as possible, as the switch from hg to git would be the ideal time to do massive history rewriting (which git is good at, by the way, using `git filter-branch`). The SPKG system in particular needs a rework, IMO. We should have one git repo containing all the patches, spkg-install scripts, SPKG.txt files, etc. for all the packages we offer, standard/optional/experimental/whatever, and then just `tar -cj` the src/ directories separately. I think we should take a look at what Burcin is doing with lmonade for clues.

I timed `fast-export` and `fast-import` of [the git repository I'm maintaining on github](http://github.com/sagemath/sagelib), as well as compression and decompression into gz, bz2, xz, and lrz archives (and the resulting filesizes):
