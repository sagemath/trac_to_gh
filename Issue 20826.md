This adds a package for the xz compression software. This is for #21047 (current autotools). 

But it might also help with some future upstream packages that no longer come with .tar.gz archives.

Please add a `dependencies` file.

Is there a particular reason that this is `experimental` instead of `optional`?

+1.

I am sure that we could make the Sage sources smaller if we ship `xz` and `.xz` tarballs.
