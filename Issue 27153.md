# Issue 27153: Py3: test_class_pickling.py fix method resolution order error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27390

Original creator: vklein

Original creation time: 2019-03-01 10:19:40

Fix the

```
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases object, bar
}}} 
errors in python3.

As `bar` inherit from `object` python3 is unable to define the method resolution order.

Add another test object and rewrite the doctests with this object.

This ticket fixes all python3 errors in `test_class_pickling.py`

It would be useful if you could post the actual errors that this ticket is supposed to fix.

I don't understand why adding the class `alpha` would fix anything.


---

Comment by vklein created at 2019-03-01 14:58:12

It's not really about adding a class `alpha`. The goal is just to have two classes with no inheritance relationship in order to do a successful call to the `metaclass` function.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-03-01 15:00:05

But why does it fail in Python 3 in the first place?


---

Comment by vklein created at 2019-03-01 15:09:22

For me the question is more why it works in python2:\\

py2

```
>>> class a:
...     pass
... 
>>> class b(object, a):
...     pass
... 
>>> class c(a,b):
...     pass
... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases
    Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases a, b
```


py3

```
>>> class a:
...     pass
... 
>>> class b(object, a):
...     pass
... 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order (MRO) for bases a, object
```


Python3 looks more consistent to me.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-03-01 15:12:16

Yes of course, I was confusing MRO errors with metaclass errors because I saw the word `metaclass` in the code.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2019-03-01 15:13:52

Since this doctests isn't about MROs, I think that a better and simpler solution would be to change the bases `(object, bar)` to `(bar, object)`.
