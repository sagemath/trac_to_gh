# Issue 17088: clear denominators for projective points does not always work

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The following code does not return the right answer


```
PS.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
Q=PS([3,2])
Q.scale_by(2/3)
print Q
Q.clear_denominators()
Q
```


the issue appears that it is not examining the last coordinate, it really needs dimension_relative+1.

I cleaned up the docs and condensed the code. You should test this again before we mark it positive.
