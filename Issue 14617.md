This is so trivial that I am surprised this bug even exists. :) Present since at least sage-5.2 till present versions.

The following integral works

```
H = exp(-10^-1*x)
H.integral(x, 0, 1)

-10*e^(-1/10) + 10
```


But the following integral errors out

```
H = exp(-1.0 * 10^-1*x)
H.integral(x, 0, 1)

Almost certainly the same error (see [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/zpbCOeljVqI):

```
sage: integral(exp(-300.0/(-0.064*x+14.0)),x,0.0,120.0) 
```

and also [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2028/def-fx-evaluvates-individually-but-not-inside-plot).

The real underlying issue is the one [at this Maxima bug](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/2510/); basically, we use `keepfloat:true` in Maxima so that things like the integral of `e<sup>(-x</sup>2)` come out right, but this causes things to go wrong in these examples.

And [Nils' comment](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JZ54xk51F-E) still applies, that it's not clear why something with a float in it should be integrated symbolically (rather than numerically) at all.  I think this is an important point, though I'm not sure how to resolve it in such a ridiculously simple case as yours.  Note that I updated the Maxima bug, and with `keepfloat:false` it is ridiculously accurate as a float.

That said, we should still have a better error message, and ideally just a correct answer.

I saw you mention in the ticket whether it is user error to provide a floating number `-1.0` in the exponential function. The `-1.0` used in the example is just an example. I had a more complicated number there. It really surprised me when the integral failed. Such kind of integrals should never fail.

Wait, I'm confused.  What does the value of the derivative have to do with `keepfloat` and this behavior?  

```
sage: H = exp(-.00001*x)
sage: H.integral(x,0,1)
<same error>
sage: plot(H,(x,0,1),ymin=0)
<essentially constant plot>
