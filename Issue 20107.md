That's the problem with deprecation warnings: it's apparently very easy to miss them.

In this case, many (most?) SageTeX users would have it used automagically within a GUI frontend like I do, where one doesn't see things like this in the log file because it zooms by so very quickly and more relevant messages are the ones at the bottom, like TeX errors ;-)

Anyway, I'm not saying we should not have merged this, I'm just saying we shouldn't release Sage 7.2 without fixing SageTeX.  #19072 would fix it.

(Which, by the way, is a perfect example of an outsourced pkg with an independent maintainer that has just been left behind by this.  Modularization, anyone?)
