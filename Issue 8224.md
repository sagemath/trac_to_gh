The following works :


```
sage: w = Word(range(10))
sage: help(w)
```


but this one :


```
sage: w = Word(lambda n:n)
sage: w
word: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,...
sage: help(w)

neither the following :


```
sage: from itertools import repeat
sage: w = Word(repeat(4))
sage: w

The patch looks good, and it works for me.  I've added Dr. Palmieri to the CC: list, in case I've missed something.
