The following text currently occurs in `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/graphs/base/c_graph.pyx`:


```python
        # The following is due to a hard to reproduce bug in Cython where except,
        # cpdef, and classes don't play well together:
        print "Not Implemented!"
        # raise NotImplementedError() ... results in:
        # Exception exceptions.NotImplementedError: NotImplementedError() in 'sage.graphs.base.c_graph.CGraph.has_arc' ignored
        # False
```


These lines were written by Robert Miller in 2009. This ticket is just to keep track of this, since it should eventually be done properly once the Cython bug is gone.

By the way, the "exception ignored" message appears to be showing up on `stderr` rather than `stdout`.

`O_o`

I had not noticed this patch. Could you rebase it ? There is a merge conflict.

Also it may be in conflict with a `needs_review` patch I just wrote (#17163), but nothing complicated in sight.

Throwing the same exception in 2 different places seemed a bit stupid. And it allows to actually test the `add_vertex_unsafe` method.

Come on, leave it as it is. What is the point ? Keep it simple: this thing is not implemented because the class is immutable, let it return an exception.

Like I said: it allows to actually test the `add_vertex_unsafe` method, which is otherwise untested.

My code is equally simple and does exactly the same thing, so why not?

How does "except -1" work when the return type is bint ?

Also, won't this cause that some calls which are currently C calls will become Python calls ?

The actual type is a C `int`. The return values mean the following:

* 0 => `False`

* -1 => exception
