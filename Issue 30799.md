```

I just added the printing of `p` and run `sage --fixdoctests`. `fixdoctests` assumed that all tests have only one line so far.


In addition we now fix error testing according to our conventions:

Before running `fixdoctests`

```diff
     EXAMPLES::
 
+        sage: raise ValueError
         sage: rt2 = AA(sqrt(2)); rt2
         1.414213562373095?
         sage: rt3 = AA(sqrt(3)); rt3
```

After running `fixdoctests`:

```diff
     EXAMPLES::
 
+        sage: raise ValueError
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        ValueError
         sage: rt2 = AA(sqrt(2)); rt2
         1.414213562373095?
         sage: rt3 = AA(sqrt(3)); rt3
```

Before running `fixdoctests`:

```
+        sage: raise TypeError("the error has changed")
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        ValueError
```

After runninng `fixdoctests`:

```diff
     EXAMPLES::
 
+        sage: raise TypeError("the error has changed")
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        TypeError: the error has changed
         sage: rt2 = AA(sqrt(2)); rt2
         1.414213562373095?
         sage: rt3 = AA(sqrt(3)); rt3
```

If a non-empty doctest raises an error after changes, then `fixdoctests` needs to run twice (probably not very likely usecase).
