# Issue 23260: relocate dyanmical systems code from sage/schemes to sage/dynamics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: sd87

the majority of the code for working with arithmetical dynamical systems is in the respective morphism files in the sage/schemes folder. This is not very intuitive and as the code grows this is becoming increasing less ideal.

This ticket proposes creating a sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics folder to house the dynamical systems code. This includes creating a class to distinguish between SchemeMorphism_polynomials which happen to be endomorphisms and those which should be treated dynamical systems. I consider this extra class as the negative effect of moving the code.

I've acheived an initial move of the code that achieves 'all tests pass', so I figured that was a good place to commit and get another set of eyes on this.

There remains much clean-up to be done. A few things I haven't done yet

- do we need to specify domain=P to get point iteration to work? What works and what doesn't with the domains

- is .as_scheme_morphism and .as_dynamical_system a performance hit (and excess object creation in memory)? If so, what's a better way to deal with this (basically the parent of a dynamical system is the endomorphism ring of schemes which creates a schememorphism...)

-  dynamicalsystems_generic defaults to affine which probably should be projective

- some more intelligence in the creation functions

I consider this ready for a review now.

When we are happy with this new functionality, then we'll need to merge in the following tickets which will conflict: #23234, #23333, #23334. So don't mark it positive-reivew even if it is ready.

Build succeeds, as do all doctests. I walked through the documentation and some examples of the new constructors ... looks pretty solid.

The branch is red above, meaning that it does not apply on the latest beta (8.1.b1).


---

Comment by bhutz created at 2017-08-08 11:30:01

Yes, I'm aware. This probably also conflicts with a number of tickets currently positive-review. I plan to do all that merging today now that the functionality for this ticket is stable.

Comments. I'm sorry if some of this is coming from old code already in Sage, but this might be a good time to clean it if it does.

Can you explain a little more about what is in the description about the extra class and why it is necessary? I don't really know this code/math so much to fully understand.

In, e.g., `orbit`, do not use `self` as a latex variable. Instead say something like, "let `X` be a dynamical system."

`Returns` -> `Return` and similar for one-line descriptions.

You are using a number of different formats for the `OUTPUT:`. I think you should at least be consistent, if not match the Sage coding conventions.

Remove `is_DynamicalSystem` because the `isinstance` already does what you want.

This is done in a number of other files.

```
from sage.categories.fields import Fields
_Fields = Fields()
```

Although I guess since module is lazily imported, it is not such a big deal. However, I would be happy to see not making this perma-instance issue worse, but not a strict requirement for a positive review.

In a number of those functions that you now are deprecating, they are not calling the new functions, correct? I think they should simply call those functions they say they are being deprecated in favor of. Some of them do this, but not all of them I believe.

There might be more comments later, but this is what I have for now on my first pass.

Comment by bhutz created at 2017-08-23 21:59:24

responding to a couple of the questions:

- the only thing new here is the dynamicalsystem class and the structure needed to create that class. The functionality within the new class is *all* relocated code. All the deprecated functions in schemes should essentially just call the new functions. I'd recommend not trying to review every single line of the relocated code for the member functions, but am happy to do any clean-up needed as you come across it.

- There are really two main reasons for this move.
 - the dynamical systems functionality is extensive enough that it should be separated from the schemes functionality. There is already a sage/dynamics folders so it makes sense to put it there.
 - creating a dynamical system under the new structure is much easier and intuitive for the user

I fixed most of those and have some discussion for the others.

- Note sure what you mean with the _Fields() import. I was told a couple years ago that it really should be done this way. Has that changed? What are the arguments for and against?

- the INPUT and OUTPUT consistently end in a '.' throughout the dynamical systems and schemes files, so I've left that consistent. However, the developer's guide does seem to give examples without ending in a period.

- For the INPUT you are suggesting the default be moved to the beginning on the description. Right now dynamical systems and schemes are consistently the other way. The conventions seem only to mention that the default value should be specified, not where.

- I'm not sure what you mean for the OUTPUT consistency. Yes, the OUTPUT description is formatted differently based on what makes the most sense for the OUTPUT of the functions, but they all match the conventions in the developer's guide.

- I disagree with removing is_DynamicalSystem. isinstance only works after you import the DynamicalSystem_generic class. With the distinction between endomorphisms and dynamical systems, it is important for the user to have an easy check for what they are working with.

- I couldn't find any instances of whether the error had capital or ending punctuation. Where did you see that?

So, the big open issue I see is whether to go through dynamical systems and schemes and change all the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting. What do you think?

> - Note sure what you mean with the _Fields() import. I was told a couple years ago that it really should be done this way. Has that changed? What are the arguments for and against?

You create a `_Fields` object in the global namespace, not an import, so it essentially becomes permanent in memory (although it is not a true memory leak). That is the argument against it. The argument for is that you might be creating the `Fields()` category frequently, which can slow things down. However, this only occurs when creating objects, so I would rather just replace `_Fields` with `Fields()`. Actually, IIRC, you can just do containment checking by `X in Fields` (without creating/getting an instance object).

The comment about the lazy import is that this is not done on startup, but only when you create one of these dynamical system objects.

> - the INPUT and OUTPUT consistently end in a '.' throughout the dynamical systems and schemes files, so I've left that consistent. However, the developer's guide does seem to give examples without ending in a period.

The convention is without periods and this is what most of Sage does.

> - For the INPUT you are suggesting the default be moved to the beginning on the description. Right now dynamical systems and schemes are consistently the other way. The conventions seem only to mention that the default value should be specified, not where.

I believe what most of Sage does is put it first, and this is what I do with all of my code that I write and request when I review. However I don't strongly care.

> - I'm not sure what you mean for the OUTPUT consistency. Yes, the OUTPUT description is formatted differently based on what makes the most sense for the OUTPUT of the functions, but they all match the conventions in the developer's guide.

Here are some of the styles used:

```

> - I disagree with removing is_DynamicalSystem. isinstance only works after you import the DynamicalSystem_generic class. With the distinction between endomorphisms and dynamical systems, it is important for the user to have an easy check for what they are working with.

Almost none of the `is_*` methods are imported into the global namespace. In fact, there are 2 (`is_field` is a little special). So `is_DynamicalSystem` should not be imported, and hence someone will have to import something anyways. Moreover, if someone wants to know the class that they are working with, then they really should be checking the appropriate class if they don't want to rely on ducktyping or trusting the user.

> - I couldn't find any instances of whether the error had capital or ending punctuation. Where did you see that?

Hmmm...I might have mixed up tickets or misremembered the Symbolic Ring errors.

> So, the big open issue I see is whether to go through dynamical systems and schemes and change all the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting. What do you think?

I wasn't sure how much you were actually adding versus copying over. Thank you for clarifying that. I am okay with letting it pass because it is how it was, but it would be nice to start converting it to the new version. I can do this with a reviewer change too.

I'll remove the global _Fields().

I'm still not 100% convinced that is_DynamicalSystem is not needed. Here is my thought process in some more detail: One of the big issues we struggled with on this ticket is how to differentiate between an endomorphism of a space and a dynamical system on a space without creating a category of schemes whose arrows are dynamical systems instead of scheme morphisms. Let's say

f = End(P)

g = DynamicalSystem(...) # on P

Then f.parent() == g.parent() is true. So without is_DynSys the only way to tell the difference is to check the class or see what member functions are available. There are simple conversion functions; e.g. f.as_dynamical_system(). Looking at the global is_* namespace, there are 21 functions currently. (The two is_ProductProjectiveSpaces is_ProjectiveSpace seem out of place and perhaps should be removed from the global name space as part of the schemes clean-up.) To me, it is a question of will a standard user need this function or not. A power user writing their own code should be able to do imports, but a standard user should not have to import something they need. I am having some trouble coming up with a realistic scenario where a standard user absolutely needs is_DynSys. Let me think about it some more.

For the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting: Updating the files in sage/dynamical systems/arithmetic dynamics/ is certainly a reasonable request as they are created here and I can do that (probably later today). I think I'd prefer updating the sage/schemes/ files on a different ticket.

If this slows things down, feel free to leave it in. Like I said, it's not a big issue because this module lazily imported.

A power user writing their own code should be able to do imports, but a standard user should not have to import something they need. I am having some trouble coming up with a realistic scenario where a standard user absolutely needs is_DynSys. Let me think about it some more.

I think most people will first try:

```python
if isinstance(X, DynamicalSystem):
    pass
```

which, of course, will be `False` because `DynamicalSystem` is a function. What I usually do for constructors that mimic ABCs is to actually fuse the two and use `__classcall__`. I really like this idiom as it better associates the (abstract) class and the constructor. So I would rename `DynamicalSystem_generic` to `DynamicalSystem`, which then has a `__classcall_private__` (which you would also need to set the metaclass to be `ClasscallMetaclass` AFAICS) that constructs the appropriate subclass.

However, this problem is no different than other homsets that have different elements/morphisms that use different subclasses. I doubt a standard user will be writing code that mixes the two or needs to differentiate the two classes based upon what you've told me as they would be working solely in the dynamical system perspective if that is what they want (especially since it is a subclass).

> For the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting: Updating the files in sage/dynamical systems/arithmetic dynamics/ is certainly a reasonable request as they are created here and I can do that (probably later today). I think I'd prefer updating the sage/schemes/ files on a different ticket.

Sounds good to me. Let me know if you want me to do it as well.

Comment by bhutz created at 2017-08-24 22:23:08

I've done the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting, but I'm having trouble with the classcall_private. I was able to get it to work for dynamicalsystems_generic since the classcall function is basically just deciding if it is affine or projective and then calling the appropriate class constructor.

I was trying to also do DS_affine and DS_projective the same way. However, I can't seem to get from the _classcall_private_ function over to the _init_ function. Some of the examples I found in Sage seem to have a secondary class so that classcall_private calls the constructor of the subclass. I guess I could do the same here, but is this really how it should work? I'd end up with

dynamcalsystem_affine (with _classcall_private_) which would then call the constructor for one of the subclasses DS_affine_ring, DS_affine_field, or DS_affine_finite_field. In other words, basically a dummy higher class to have _classcall_private_ which calls the actual class constructors. It seems like I'm not understanding how this should all work.

Do you know how _classcall_private_ should interact with _init_?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-08-25 04:41:57

So `__clascall_private__` takes input and then it will be passed up with a `super(Foo, cls).__classcall__(cls, args)` call (as in other examples, e.g., `Partition`). This then calls the `__init__` with these methods. (Just incase you are unaware, this needs to be an ``@`staticmethod`.) However, if you want to delegate to, e.g., a subclass (but it really can be anything), you do `return Foo(bar)`.

Maybe a more standard example that just standardizes input would be `algebras/yokonuma_hecke_algebra.py` (note that the metaclass is set because it is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`).

I tried that first as that is what most instances are doing, but I get an AttributeError that super doesn't have a _classcall_. If you could take a look that would be appreciated.

I've pushed the INPUT/OUTPUT clean-up as well as setting up the changes needed to use _classcall_private_. It currently has the super()._classcall_() where I think it should go. If you can get that initialization to work and push that back up, I'll go through and fix any remaining issues since I couldn't really test as it is now.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-08-25 19:43:42

Okay, I've fix up the classcall. It didn't have a superclass that actually implemented the `__classcall__`, so you have to explicitly have to use `typecall`. I forgot about that, sorry. I also made it through the doc and code and did a bunch of cleanup and more micro-optimizations I know.

If my changes look good, then positive review.
