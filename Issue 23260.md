Keywords: sd87

the majority of the code for working with arithmetical dynamical systems is in the respective morphism files in the sage/schemes folder. This is not very intuitive and as the code grows this is becoming increasing less ideal.

This ticket proposes creating a sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics folder to house the dynamical systems code. This includes creating a class to distinguish between SchemeMorphism_polynomials which happen to be endomorphisms and those which should be treated dynamical systems. I consider this extra class as the negative effect of moving the code.

I've acheived an initial move of the code that achieves 'all tests pass', so I figured that was a good place to commit and get another set of eyes on this.

There remains much clean-up to be done. A few things I haven't done yet

- do we need to specify domain=P to get point iteration to work? What works and what doesn't with the domains

- is .as_scheme_morphism and .as_dynamical_system a performance hit (and excess object creation in memory)? If so, what's a better way to deal with this (basically the parent of a dynamical system is the endomorphism ring of schemes which creates a schememorphism...)

-  dynamicalsystems_generic defaults to affine which probably should be projective

- some more intelligence in the creation functions

When we are happy with this new functionality, then we'll need to merge in the following tickets which will conflict: #23234, #23333, #23334. So don't mark it positive-reivew even if it is ready.

Comments. I'm sorry if some of this is coming from old code already in Sage, but this might be a good time to clean it if it does.

Can you explain a little more about what is in the description about the extra class and why it is necessary? I don't really know this code/math so much to fully understand.

Indentation here:

Do you want to worry about backwards compatibility with imports?

In, e.g., `orbit`, do not use `self` as a latex variable. Instead say something like, "let `X` be a dynamical system."

`Returns` -> `Return` and similar for one-line descriptions.

You are using a number of different formats for the `OUTPUT:`. I think you should at least be consistent, if not match the Sage coding conventions.

Remove `is_DynamicalSystem` because the `isinstance` already does what you want.

This is done in a number of other files.

```
from sage.categories.fields import Fields
_Fields = Fields()
```

Although I guess since module is lazily imported, it is not such a big deal. However, I would be happy to see not making this perma-instance issue worse, but not a strict requirement for a positive review.

In a number of those functions that you now are deprecating, they are not calling the new functions, correct? I think they should simply call those functions they say they are being deprecated in favor of. Some of them do this, but not all of them I believe.

There might be more comments later, but this is what I have for now on my first pass.

You create a `_Fields` object in the global namespace, not an import, so it essentially becomes permanent in memory (although it is not a true memory leak). That is the argument against it.

I think most people will first try:

```python
if isinstance(X, DynamicalSystem):
    pass
```

which, of course, will be `False` because `DynamicalSystem` is a function. What I usually do for constructors that mimic ABCs is to actually fuse the two and use `__classcall__`. I really like this idiom as it better associates the (abstract) class and the constructor. So I would rename `DynamicalSystem_generic` to `DynamicalSystem`, which then has a `__classcall_private__` (which you would also need to set the metaclass to be `ClasscallMetaclass` AFAICS) that constructs the appropriate subclass.

However, this problem is no different than other homsets that have different elements/morphisms that use different subclasses. I doubt a standard user will be writing code that mixes the two or needs to differentiate the two classes based upon what you've told me as they would be working solely in the dynamical system perspective if that is what they want (especially since it is a subclass).

> For the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting: Updating the files in sage/dynamical systems/arithmetic dynamics/ is certainly a reasonable request as they are created here and I can do that (probably later today). I think I'd prefer updating the sage/schemes/ files on a different ticket.

Sounds good to me. Let me know if you want me to do it as well.

I've done the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting, but I'm having trouble with the classcall_private. I was able to get it to work for dynamicalsystems_generic since the classcall function is basically just deciding if it is affine or projective and then calling the appropriate class constructor.

I was trying to also do DS_affine and DS_projective the same way. However, I can't seem to get from the _classcall_private_ function over to the _init_ function. Some of the examples I found in Sage seem to have a secondary class so that classcall_private calls the constructor of the subclass.

Do you know how _classcall_private_ should interact with _init_?
