This must be an old version of Sage. `sympy` can no longer be imported from there. Instead you use `sympy_converter` or the member function `_sympy_`:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression_conversions import sympy_converter
sage: sympy_converter(x==x)
Eq(x, x)
sage: (x==x)._sympy_()
Eq(x, x)
sage: type(_)
<class 'sympy.core.relational.Equality'>
```
