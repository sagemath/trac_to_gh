(This originally was reported in a much different form at [this math.SX question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2533864/function-solve-and-sympy-solve-in-sage).)

This must be an old version of Sage. `sympy` can no longer be imported from there. Instead you use `sympy_converter` or the member function `_sympy_`:

```
sage: from sage.symbolic.expression_conversions import sympy_converter
sage: sympy_converter(x==x)
Eq(x, x)
sage: (x==x)._sympy_()
Eq(x, x)
sage: type(_)
<class 'sympy.core.relational.Equality'>
```

Not very old?  8.1.beta5 or something.   Good news!  Will it solve the issues at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2533864/function-solve-and-sympy-solve-in-sage then as well? If so, positive review to closing this.

There is #24078 which is needed too but has nothing to do with this ticket.
