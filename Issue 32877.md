(from slabbe in #33092?replyto=23#comment:23)

Maybe changes needs to be done with respect to `is_present()`, `is_functional()` and `require()`. In particular, I have the following questions for `@`mkoeppe:
- why `Feature.require()` does not check that `is_functional()` is True?
- should `is_present()` always return False when `is_functional` return False (even if the vocabulary that is used should logically allow it)?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33114

I believe that the original idea was to use this in the build process of [SageMath](SageMath). This influence some of the choices we made back then. If I understand correctly, that's not what we are planning to do anymore.

Anyway, `require` calls `is_present` which calls `is_functional`. At least that's the idea. As far as I recall, `is_functional` is just meant as a hook that you can override to add an additional check while relying on the generic `is_present` check. It should maybe be renamed to `_is_functional` to make this more obvious.

So, `is_present` means: is the feature present and functional.

Similarly, `require` means: require this feature to be present in the above sense.

I believe that the task here is to improve the documentation of these methods if that is not sufficiently clear.

Ok, this is how I understood the feature code up to today, but the meaning of `is_present` vs `is_functional` always perturbed me.

When we speak with someone verbally, it is possible that we observe for example as in #33092 that imagemagick is "installed" on a machine, thus the convert command "is present", but it "is not functional" because it can't handle PNG files for instance. In real life, it happens that a feature is present but not functional. This is why the current design is weird a little (but probably easy to fix, for example by adding a new method `is_present_and_functional()` that would be used by `require()` and in the sagemath library.)

What I realised today in #33092#comment:20 is that JoinFeature currently does not follow the same behavior with respect to `is_present` vs `is_functional`. Instead, it follows what we would be saying logically: a feature may be present but not functional.

I'd propose to rename `is_present` to `is_present_and_functional` and `is_functional` to `_is_functional`. I agree that it's confusing.
