# Issue 14676: Compute the p-adic Gamma function

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: asalerno

Original creation time: 2013-07-12 00:57:05

Assignee: roed

Keywords: p-adic gamma, p-adic functions, dwork

This function computes the p-adic Gamma function of a p-adic integer. This code is based on Pari code by Fernando Rodriguez-Villegas which uses an expansion due to Dwork.

your patch did not apply (seems to be some problem with the encoding of carriage returns)

so I used it to make a new one, with some corrections to the documentation formatting

for the bot:

apply only trac_14880_padic_gamma_v2.patchâ€‹

When the algorithm is 'pari' it doesn't return an element in the p-adic ring:

sage: R = Zp(3)

sage: x = R(5).padic_gamma()

sage: x.parent()

Interface to the PARI C library

But coerce seems to work, so maybe just adding a coerce before returning the result will fix it:

sage: R(x).parent()

3-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
