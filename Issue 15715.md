# Issue 15715: import statements with both absolute and (implicit) relative imports

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-03-16 10:55:34

Keywords: python3, import

There are 3 modules in `sage/misc` mixing both absolute and local imports in a single import statement.

This is a problem with Python 3. 

Also, mixing standard library imports with application specific imports is not PEP8 compliant.
