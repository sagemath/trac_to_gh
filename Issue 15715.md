Keywords: python3, import

There are 3 modules in `sage/misc` mixing both absolute and local imports in a single import statement.

This is a problem with Python 3. 

Also, mixing standard library imports with application specific imports is not PEP8 compliant.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15952
