# Issue 16693: Deprecate non-polynomial modulus argument in constructor of implementations of finite fields

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-09-04 09:22:49

The "modulus" parameter for finite fields is handled by the fancy new `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/constructor.py` and the implementations of finite fields should only take a polynomial as modulus.
