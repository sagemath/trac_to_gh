Currently we fall back on PARI if 4 divides the modulus, and we don't check first to see if the jacobi symbol is -1 (in which case we can declare a quadratic non-residue without factoring the modulus).  This patch fixes both problems.

Looks good.  Passes doctests.  Much faster when Jacobi symbol is -1 and no slower otherwise.

The patch did not apply anymore due to the fact that the `pari()` method was renamed to `_pari_()`.  I fixed this, and then did the following (inspired by the new doctest):

```python
def test_native():
    for p,q,r in cartesian_product_iterator([[3,5],[11,13],[17,19]]):
        for ep,eq,er in cartesian_product_iterator([[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3]]):
            for e2 in [0,1,2,3,4]:
                n = p^ep*q^eq*r^er*2^e2
                for _ in range(2):
                    a = Zmod(n).random_element()
                    b = a.is_square()

def test_pari():
    for p,q,r in cartesian_product_iterator([[3,5],[11,13],[17,19]]):
        for ep,eq,er in cartesian_product_iterator([[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3],[0,1,2,3]]):
            for e2 in [0,1,2,3,4]:
                n = p^ep*q^eq*r^er*2^e2
                for _ in range(2):
                    a = Zmod(n).random_element()
                    b = bool(a._pari_().issquare())
```

I got the following timings:

```
sage: %timeit test_native()
1 loops, best of 3: 3.11 s per loop
sage: %timeit test_pari()
1 loops, best of 3: 2.98 s per loop
```

From the perspective of someone who does not want to reinvent the wheel, this suggests that we should just call PARI instead of using a native Sage implementation.

What is behind this is that Sage caches the factorisation of *n* in `Zmod(n)`, while PARI has to factor `n` every time.  With your values of `a` and `n`, the PARI version used by Sage on my system needs 367 us for `issquare(Mod(a, n))`, while `factor(n)` takes 360 us.  This means that 98% of the cost of `issquare()` in this case is spent on factoring `n`.

So for a single call, PARI is probably slightly faster, while the Sage implementation is faster for multiple calls within one `Zmod(n)` thanks to the cached factorisation.

Here are some timings (on Linux x86_64):


```
a = 176338465705
b = 161089773287
n = 217267613611

pari 2.5.4: 1.18 us
pari 2.6.1: 155 us

pari 2.6.1: 0.981 us
sage 5.11.rc0: 0.709 us

factorint(n) resp. n.factor()
pari 2.5.4: 360 us
pari 2.6.1: 330 us
sage 5.11.rc0: 157 us
```


Note:
- almost all the time for `issquare` in PARI is spent on factoring `n` (see above).
- there is a dramatic slowdown between PARI 2.5.4 and 2.6.1 for `issquare(Mod(b, n))`.  (Edit: this has been fixed in the latest Git version of PARI.)
- Kronecker symbols and factoring are faster in Sage than in PARI for this value of *n*; this is because Sage uses the right pre-invented wheel (GMP resp. Flint).
- this patch slows down the Sage function by a factor of 3 for *a* mod *n*, but speeds it up by 30% for *b* mod *n*.

After experimenting with various mixtures of Cython and PARI, I believe that the most efficient solution is to use Cython for those checks for non-squareness that don't require factoring, and if that fails, call PARI's `Zn_issquare` function with the modulus in factored form.  I made a patch and am now running doctests.

There seems to be a very slight slowdown with respect to the current implementation if the element is a square (perhaps because the above quick tests are done once in Cython and again in PARI), but a noticeable speedup if it is not.

Hi, I didn't have time to go through this ticket, but FYI I've reimplemented the modular squareroot in cython using mpz's (translating the original python/cython implem) at least when the mod is prime or 4 times a prime as part of an implementation of ECPP.
It's much faster than what we have and faster than PARI IIRC.
This should get published together with the rest of the ECPP implem when the code is a little more polished, let's say before the end of the year hopefully.
