We have

```
sage: next(xsrange(0, 2^63-2^10+2^9))
...
OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long
```

This is because the internally used variable `count` is to large.

FYI,

```
sage: next(xsrange(0, 2^63-2^10+2^9-1))
0
```

works

An easy fix would be to bound this variable `count` (currently, it seems to be unlikely that more than `2^63-...` iterations occur...).
