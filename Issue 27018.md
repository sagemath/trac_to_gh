Trying to "group" the coefficients like

```
sage: P.<a, b, n> = QQ[]
sage: N = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'n')
sage: AB = PolynomialRing(N, 'a, b')
sage: AB(a*n + a*n^2)
```

fails with 

```
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```

but the result should be

```
(n + n^2)*a
```


As an interesting side note, the Laurent polynomial ring can do it:

```
sage: L = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b, n')
sage: LN = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'n')
sage: LAB = LaurentPolynomialRing(LN, 'a, b')
sage: LAB(L(a*n + a*n^2))
(n + n^2)*a
```


The Laurent polynomial ring can do this since #21855. And #22333 is about reusing this code, so there is a good chance that #22333 fixes this as well.
