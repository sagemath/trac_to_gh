I think this is more like a problem with the testing framework. Here is a sample block that fails the test:

```
sage: C = codes.HammingCode(3,GF(2))
sage: Cm = magma(C)                 # optional - magma, indirect doctest
sage: Cm.MinimumWeight()            # optional - magma
3
```


The problem with this (and I suspect most of the others) is that when the ``--only-optional=magma`` flag prevents the first line in the block above to get executed, and thus C remains undefined and causes a failure in the second line.

I think that having to write the ``# optional - magma`` thing in each line of a block is quite awful. It would be better that the ``--only-optional=magma`` flag ran (in full) those blocks containing at least one ``# optional - magma`` line.

I don't know how to do this myself, though...

The proper way to run magma doctest is with `sage -t -optional=magma,sage`. The optional `sage` applies to line without `# optional`.

Is this documented well?

Is there still a problem, or can we close this ticket?  (I think I've seen some more recent one regarding the Magma interface, but I'm not sure.)
