# Issue 3449: notebook -- implement inline error reporting for login

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3449

Currently when a user has entered incorrect login information she is sent to a page that states the error.

The error should be reported under the input box related to the error. Also if the user gave an incorrect password than the username should be filled in and the error should be given inline.
