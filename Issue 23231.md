This is a an example:


```
sage: R.<z> = QQ[]
....: x = 1/5
....: K.<y> = QQ.extension(z^2 + (x^2 + 1)*z + x)
....: for p in K.primes_of_degree_one_list(10):
....:     p.factor()
....:     
(Fractional ideal (25/2*y + 5/2)) * (Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (25/2*y + 17/2))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (-25*y - 18))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (25*y + 22))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (25*y + 14))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (25/2*y - 3/2))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (-125/2*y - 93/2))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (75/2*y + 31/2))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (25/2*y + 33/2))
(Fractional ideal (-25/2*y - 21/2))^-2 * (Fractional ideal (-75/2*y - 67/2))
```
