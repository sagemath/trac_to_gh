Keywords: interior_product, set_name

In Sage 9.6.rc3, the interior product of a *named* vector field with a *named* 1-form resulting in zero yields an error: 

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x, y> = M.chart()
sage: v = X.frame()[0]    # vector field d/dx
sage: f = X.coframe()[1]  # 1-form dy
sage: v.interior_product(f)
...
ValueError: the name of an immutable element cannot be changed
```
This is because `set_name` is called on `M.zero_scalar_field()`, while it should not.
