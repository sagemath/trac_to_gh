In #16836 the `__neg__` operation for cartesian product was moved from `AdditiveMagmas` to the `AdditiveMagmas.WithInverse()`. The operation was ambiguous but the feature is lost. It should be decided in this ticket what should be done with it.

One should also restore the `TODO` section about `NN` being lazily import (or fix it ;-)
