```markdown
we are not actually building these anymore so we should not try to build
everything twice.
```

I also drop the "Maintained" badge. It appeared to be a good idea at the time but due to a bug in docker hub, we cannot update the README automatically, so it says unmaintained every year until we notice.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to docker.

Suggested rephrasing for the comment about `-py3`:

```
* `-py3` - until Sage 9.1, we provided Python 2 builds (with no suffix)
   and Python 3 builds (with the `-py3` suffix). From Sage 9.2.beta0 on,
   we only provide Python 3 based images and the `-py3` suffix survives
   only for historic reasons: with or without it, you get Python 3.
```

Should "for historic reasons" read "for historical reasons"?

Getting rid of the non-working "maintained" badge makes sense.

Replying to [comment:3 slelievre]:

I think so.

Perhaps the rephrasing can be by done in a commit by the reviewer.
Let's get this in
