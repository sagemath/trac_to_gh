# Issue 13636: IntegerListsLex speedup

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2012-12-18 16:06:07

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat nthiery

Keywords: optimization, integerlistlex

This patch speeds up `IntegerListsLex` by removing calls to sage's `infinity` and has `max_slope` and `min_slope` set to `None` and has `max_part` default to `float(infinity)`.

Before the patch:

```
sage: time p = Partitions(150, max_slope=-1, length=15).list()        
Time: CPU 14.04 s, Wall: 14.64 s
```

After:

```
sage: time p = Partitions(150, max_slope=-1, length=15).list()
Time: CPU 2.86 s, Wall: 2.98 s
```

How was this patch file created?  It is missing a "User" field, you should create a `$HOME/.hgrc` file as explained in [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_patches.html) and export the patch using `hg export tip`.
