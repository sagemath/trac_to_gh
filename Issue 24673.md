Currently, the MacLane algorithm requires as input a polynomial G which is both monic and integral (with respect to the base valuation). Relaxing this condition would allow to approximate the irreducible factors with integral roots of an arbitrary polynomial G.


```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = QQ.valuation(2)
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: f = 1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x + 1
sage: v.mac_lane_approximants(f)
ValueError: G must be integral
```

Changing keywords from "" to "maclane, valuations".
