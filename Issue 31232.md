We should add Galois groups of finite fields, in parallel to the Galois groups of number fields.  They will be used in #25902 for algebraic tori.

The definition of `_field_degree` as the relative degree was wrong, since for the moment we're converting Galois groups of relative extensions to the Galois group of the corresponding absolute field (for backward compatibility and because we can't compute Galois groups of relative extensions in general).
