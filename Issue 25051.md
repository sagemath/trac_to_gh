CC:  jdemeyer roed robertwb vdelecroix

In #17851 we disabled Cython caching. We should fix the underlying issues:

* https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1397
* https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1399
* https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1393
* and move the cython cache to a Sage specific directory

And then enable caching again :)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25288

On #25292, you were doubting that Sage should upgrade to Cython 0.29 (which is a requirement for this ticket).

I have no problem if sage-the-distribution upgrades to Cython 0.29; I just think it shouldn't *depend* on it unconditionally.  E.g. it would be good to use a version check before enabling features like this that depend on a specific Cython version.
