I just disabled the safeguards that I had certainly put there for good reasons. I could imagine that without these I'd need more logic to fix things related to comparison and equality of valuations.

I'll monkey patch this in MCLF for https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/issues/39 so swewers can play with this and see whether this actually works.

swewers: Does this change seem to work? If so, I'd prepare it for actual inclusion in Sage.

Yes, the code in https://github.com/MCLF/mclf/tree/develop uses this change, and it seems to work.
