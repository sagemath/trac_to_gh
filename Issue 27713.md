the [SageMath installation guide for conda](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html)

After doing

```
$ conda install mamba -c conda-forge # installs mamba
```

does something need to be done to make `mamba` work?
Running this directly

```
$ mamba create -n sage sage -c conda-forge # replaces "conda create..."
```

gives an error:

```
-bash: mamba: command not found
```

It seems to be a matter of letting conda tweak one's PATH vs not.

Running the following works for me (I installed Miniconda in `/opt`):

```
$ /opt/miniconda3/bin/mamba create -n sage sage -c conda-forge
```


Besides that: maybe add some actual date instead of `|today|` in:

```
At the time of this edit (|today|)
```

it seems that your setup is non-standard (wrong `conda` is called ?). What I see that `conda` and `mamba` are installed into the same directory, and so whenever you have one in PATH, you have the other, too.
