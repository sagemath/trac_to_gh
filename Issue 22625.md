# Issue 22625: Invalid pointers in sympow on OpenSuSE

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22862

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-04-24 06:57:54

On OpenSuSE which apparently has a stricter memory checking:

```
sage: sympow.analytic_rank(EllipticCurve('11a'))
...
/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/lfunctions/sympow.pyc in analytic_rank(self, E)
    295         if i == -1:
    296             print(self._fix_err(v))
--> 297             raise RuntimeError("failed to compute analytic rank")
    298         j = v.rfind(':')
    299         r = sage.rings.all.Integer(v[i+len(s):j])

RuntimeError: failed to compute analytic rank

*** Error in `./sympow': free(): invalid pointer: 0xbabababababababa ***

this probably can be debugged by running sympow separately under valgrind.

It must be decades since I saw such badly formatted code...

a quick fix would be to use calloc (which does initialise the memory) for allocating TACKS instead of malloc, and then only call free() on non-null pointers in TACKS[].

Yes, `TACKS` is not initialized in these cases.

please bump up the package version, i.e. 1.018.1.p11 -> 1.018.1.p12 in `package-version.txt`.
