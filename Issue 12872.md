I can verify that our current ECL chokes with "`env CC='nice gcc' ./spkg -i ecl...`" and that your spkg fixes it. Perhaps it would be nice to put something into the generated `ecl_cc` so we know whence it came: maybe a comment like `# ECL chokes when CC contains spaces; this script works around that. See #13044.` Then it would be easier to remove this workaround when ECL is updated.

Also, I tried `env CXX='nice g++' ./sage -f ecl...` with the old version and it worked fine. Perhaps we shouldn't also create `ecl_cxx` since ECL is not using a C++ compiler.

Also`^2`, we should send this upstream.

Added the patch to the spkg.  It applies to the current version of the spkg with a bit of fuzz.  

If I understand correctly I should also update the patch version, and upload a new source package? Not sure exactly how to go about that though.

In this exceptional case I think it's not needed because there is no reason to rebuild everybody's ECL with this patch. And in the cases where ECL didn't install before, there is no **re**build needed since there couldn't have been a build in the first place.

> and upload a new source package?
No, because you are not changing the source tarball, just adding a patch.
