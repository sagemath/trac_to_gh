What is the purpose of these `from __future__ import` ? AFAIK python does have a print function (in `__builtin__`); do you need to change it in a drastic way?

this ticket is part of a large set of tickets that prepare sage to run with python3
by adapting the syntax of print, which has changed between py2 and py3

the `from future import` is there to obtain the py3 behaviour in py2

Could you point me to a place in this branch where this import is needed?

nowhere maybe, but still this is useful as a marker and placeholder that no bad use of print will appear here.

see

and

The main idea is: looking at all the code of sage and correcting the prints
is not a light task. Let us try to do it only once.

I just mean that files that do not need this import should not have it.
Note that they also create an extra confusion, as doctsrings still have python2 `print()` calls.
