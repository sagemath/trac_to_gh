Keywords: bitset, typecasting, fused types

This ticket makes typecasts to functions in `data_structures/bitset.pxi` explicit.

This allows [fused types](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/fusedtypes.html,) as signatures of those functions. E.g.

`cdef inline void bitset_add(bitset_t bits, mp_bitcnt_t n)` -> `cdef inline void bitset_add(fused_bitset_t bits, mp_bitcnt_t n)`. Fused functions do not allow from `PyObject`. (`int` to `size_t` etc. is ok though.)

This way, we can use most of the code in `bitset.pxi` for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, while easily optimizing it for the special situation.
