In order to finish #22029, we need one patch to Pynac. This affects only 2 doctests in all of Sage, so it's quite innocent.

Right, right. Is there a matching pull request? Does the maintainer (Ralph) react in a swift enough fashion for a new release? If a new release is cut now, are there any new features or changes beside this patch that will require changes on sage side?

Yes in an ideal world we want and wait for the next release and we can make that request but sage is a bit of a fast conveyor belt at times :)

No. That might actually be a reason not to make a new release: we just had an upgrade (#26995) and the PR for this ticket is the only change to master since then.

As I mentioned in the ticket description, this patch affects only 2 doctests in Sage which would otherwise break with #22029.

You could also not add the patch and live with 2 additional doctest failures.

I think that #22029 is too important to be held back by a Pynac release.

I couldn't, any test failures fail the build.

What makes that 2yr old ticket so urgent now?

Debian seems to think otherwise, but I'm actually glad that you don't want any test failures. OK, but then you could still add a patch to remove/disable those 2 tests.

It's a ticket which makes far-reaching changing and I'm worried about regressions against it.

Debian is in a somewhat more difficult position, with their limited control of the environment sage executes in and additional bureaucracy.

Alright, I haven't looked into the details and don't know how important it is. Patching pynac is not a terribly big deal for me (especially since sage is its *only* consumer in nixpkgs). So I'm mostly arguing out of principle, since I'm trying to change the "just patch" attitude.

Having expressed my opinion about this (I'm still not convinced patching is worth it here, waiting for a new pynac release would probably only introduce a couple of days delay), I won't argue any further.
