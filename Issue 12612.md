Is there anything to review here?  I read the sage-devel thing, and I don't see why this wouldn't take care of the issue.  But I don't want to get in trouble with those worried about (re)build times...

Although I should point out

I think due to the formatting of the patch file for some reason.

```

should the `SAGERUNTIME` be in the same line as the ``@``@``?
