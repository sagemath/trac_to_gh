OK. So with #15114 in mind, this should be a feature and not a bug:

```
sage: CC.one() + CIF.one()

TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Complex Field with 53 bits of precision' and 'Complex Interval Field with 53 bits of precision'

    "body": "Some comments:\n\n- I know this is slightly outside the purview of this ticket, but perhaps we can rename `ComplexIntervalField_class` to `ComplexIntervalField` and have it inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` in order to get rid of the custom caching. I can also do this if you want.\n- I would do the same for `RealIntervalField_class` except it is an extension class. Do you think there is a benefit for that? We don't even do that for `Rationals`.\n- Why not use ``@`cached_method` for `real_field`, `middle_field`, etc.? They to have `UniqueRepresentation`-like behavior, so do not strictly need to be cached.

Some comments:

- I know this is slightly outside the purview of this ticket, but perhaps we can rename `ComplexIntervalField_class` to `ComplexIntervalField` and have it inherit from `UniqueRepresentation` in order to get rid of the custom caching. I can also do this if you want.
- I would do the same for `RealIntervalField_class` except it is an extension class. Do you think there is a benefit for that? We don't even do that for `Rationals`.
- Why not use ``@`cached_method` for `real_field`, `middle_field`, etc.? They to have `UniqueRepresentation`-like behavior, so do not strictly need to be cached. However, I am assuming they are cached for speed reasons, so doing ``@`cached_method` is the best for repeated use:

- Is the `_real_field = real_field` leftover from testing? I think it should be removed altogether.
- You should replace
  {{{#!diff
        return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, x, im, **kwds)
        return self.element_class(self, x, im, **kwds)
  }}}
  (in fact, if that is used elsewhere in the file, it should be replaced as well) to pick up the category contributions.
- Same comment for returning `RealIntervalFieldElement`.
- Similarly, I would also make this change:
  {{{#!diff
     R = RealIntervalField(prec=max(bits+pad, min_prec))
     if upper is not None:
         s = (s, upper)
-    return RealIntervalFieldElement(R, s, base)
+    return R.element_class(R, s, base)
 }}}

I think it looks good otherwise.

Thank you for doing the cleanup.

For changes such as

```diff
-        cdef ComplexIntervalFieldElement res = self._new()
+        res = self._new()
```

aren't we loosing some efficiency? I would think because they are still subclasses of `ComplexIntervalFieldElement`, that Cython would be able to optimize their attribute lookups by not treating them as Python objects? (Of course, we would have to explicitly cast `<ComplexIntervalFieldElement>` to avoid the type-checking-safety-penalty.)

This goes through the `__call__` (which in this case, bypasses the coercion framework, but normally it wouldn't):

```diff
-        return complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement(self, 0, 1)
+        return self(0, 1)
```

I think we are better making a direct call to `self.element_class(self, 0, 1)` since this is not user input.

That is what is happening, e.g.:

```C
  __pyx_t_1 = ((PyObject *)__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_16complex_interval_27ComplexIntervalFieldE
lement__new(__pyx_v_self)); if (unlikely(!__pyx_t_1)) __PYX_ERR(0, 325, __pyx_L1_error)

I didn't realize that Cython was that smart. :)

Thank you. LGTM. (If I wanted to be **really** picky, I would say `self.element_class(self, 1)` should instead use the cached `self.one()`, but `zeta(1)` is almost certainly never called.)
