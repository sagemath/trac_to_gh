Do you have an idea how much time you need to fix the problems with #22364? Given that #22364 needs work anyway, it makes sense to fix this ticket there (and close this as duplicate). On the other hand, if you don't manage to fix #22364 quickly, we should fix this ticket first because it gives doctest failures.

No idea about the time because the cause of that is not established with certainty. So, as fixing this the usual way would need a new release that includes #22364 it would be best to not do a release but commit a Pynac patch (containing https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/a4dce19f33fc52245f324cb535d24233988dcfa1.diff) with this branch.

Patches are automatically applied now, you should not manually run `sage-apply-patches` (so you can remove the whole `patch()` function).
