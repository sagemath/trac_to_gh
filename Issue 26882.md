No yet, i first have to build it outside of Sage for that, and i currently use my VM for releasing SDL 8.6., this is on my list for the Sage week at CIRM, unless you think it more urgent.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "" to "sdl".
