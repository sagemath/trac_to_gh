The one patch here is now ready to go, despite the (old) comment on it.

Looks good to me.  I might change the phrase "The subdivisions that are provided automatically will partition ..." to "By default, the matrix will be subdivided ...".  If you feel like making that change, it won't require a new review.

Thanks for the suggestion, John.  I wrote that a couple of times and wasn't happy with it.  v2 patch has the suggested change.
