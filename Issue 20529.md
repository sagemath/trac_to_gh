currently we are using maxima through pexpect in lattice_plytope

let us instead go through the generic MILP setting

Replying to [comment:6 mkoeppe]:
> Should use an LP for this, not an IP. 

Not sure what you mean. So far, I have not thought about what this is doing, but
only on how to redo what that there before without using maxima.

If you have precise suggestions, please make them as explicit as possible.

The old code, using Maxima, calls the simplex method to solve an LP. 
Your code uses `new_variable(integer=True, ...)` to solve an IP. 
There's a fundamental difference between an LP and and IP.

ok, please pardon my dumb ignorance, but what does IP stands for ?

LP = Linear Program = all variables real (continuous)

I'm saying that you should use `new_variable` with `continuous=True` if you want to imitate whatever it was that the Maxima simplex algorithm did.
