# Issue 32008: Quaternion ideals' .scale() method constructs incomparable ideals

Keywords: quaternion ideals

On sage 9.3, the following code unexpectedly prints `False`:

```
Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
I = Q.maximal_order().unit_ideal()
print(I.scale(1) == I)
```

(This behaviour was discovered by Jana Sotáková.)

Cause: The `.scale()` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` passes the set of generators of the scaled ideal to the parent algebra's `.ideal()` method as a `list`, whereas other code seems to assume that the basis is stored as a `tuple`. In particular, the `__eq__` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` simply compares the `__basis` members, and since a list is never equal to a tuple, the equality tested in the snippet above fails even though scaling an ideal by 1 clearly shouldn't change anything.

Fix: Use a tuple instead of a list.
We could also enforce this in `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational.__init__` even when `check=False` is passed, or explicitly cast to `tuple` in `__eq__` just in case; opinions are welcome.

I think converting the argument to a tuple inside either the `__init__()` method (as you suggest) or the `ideal()` method is a more robust solution.  The `ideal()` method can be called directly by users and we shouldn't force them to insert `tuple()` by hand to avoid running into this problem.
