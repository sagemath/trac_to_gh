# Issue 32008: Quaternion ideals' .scale() method constructs incomparable ideals

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32245

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2021-07-20 08:53:22

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: quaternion ideals

On sage 9.3, the following code unexpectedly prints `False`:

```
Q.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(-1,-19)
I = Q.maximal_order().unit_ideal()
print(I.scale(1) == I)
```

(This behaviour was discovered by Jana Sotáková.)

Cause: The `.scale()` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` passes the set of generators of the scaled ideal to the parent algebra's `.ideal()` method as a `list`, whereas other code seems to assume that the basis is stored as a `tuple`. In particular, the `__eq__` method for `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational` simply compares the `__basis` members, and since a list is never equal to a tuple, the equality tested in the snippet above fails even though scaling an ideal by 1 clearly shouldn't change anything.

Fix: Use a tuple instead of a list.
We could also enforce this in `QuaternionFractionalIdeal_rational.__init__` even when `check=False` is passed, or explicitly cast to `tuple` in `__eq__` just in case; opinions are welcome.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I think converting the argument to a tuple inside either the `__init__()` method (as you suggest) or the `ideal()` method is a more robust solution.  The `ideal()` method can be called directly by users and we shouldn't force them to insert `tuple()` by hand to avoid running into this problem.

Thanks for the fast response! I added an explicit cast to `tuple` in the constructors for both quaternion orders and quaternion ideals.

Looks good!  Could you add a doctest to show that the bug has been fixed?

Done.

However, here's another bug that's somewhat related: `I.scale(-1)` is also not equal to `I` because `__eq__` compares bases, but `.scale()` simply multiplies each basis element by `-1`. I think we should just be comparing the `.basis_matrix()` members in `__eq__` as they are guaranteed to be in HNF. They are cached as well, so the performance impact should be negligible.

Similarly, quaternion _orders_ also only compare bases in `__eq__`, which in that case is documented, but probably not the expected behaviour for most users. I suggest changing that to an actual lattice equality test as well.

Right!  I noticed this too some time ago.  Moreover, if I remember correctly, the claim that the basis matrix is guaranteed to be in HNF is actually false in the current implementation.  I even started writing a patch, but didn't get around to finishing it.  Let me try to see if it applies to your branch.

The above commit makes sure that `basis_matrix()` returns a matrix in Hermite normal form (up to a denominator), as described in the documentation.  It also uses the basis matrix to compare ideals. The documentation is updated so that it no longer claims that the basis itself (as opposed to the matrix) is or must be in HNF.

After my previous commit, ideals in different quaternion algebras with the same HNF basis matrices incorrectly compared equal.  The above commit fixes `__eq__()` so that it also compares the ambient quaternion algebras, not just the HNF basis matrices.

I've just pushed another commit to make `__eq__` for quaternion orders simply compare the unit ideals, since I think properties such as

```
Q.quaternion_order([1,-i,k,j]) != Q.quaternion_order([1,i,j,k])
```

are unexpected and weird. I feel that if someone wants to compare bases, they should be comparing the `.basis()` members rather than the orders themselves. Or was there a good reason to keep the current behaviour?

This change makes sense to me.  In the future we could even try making quaternion orders a subclass of quaternion ideals, so they inherit comparison and possibly other useful methods.

I just noticed that I already made a similar change in #31582.  This is likely to cause merge conflicts.  Normally I would try to merge #31582 into the branch of this ticket, but I see you already based #32264 on this branch.  What do you think about merging #31582 here and then rebasing #32264 on top of that?

Bumping priority since this bug can lead to mathematical errors.

Changing priority from minor to major.

The comments in the doctests (like `# trac #32245`) are not welcome. They should rather use text before the doctests with the trac roles like `:trac:`32245``

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
