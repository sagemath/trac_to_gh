Keywords: classical lie algebra matrix _matrix_

A method to obtain the underlying matrix as element of the corresponding full matrix space analog to the similar method of MatrixGroupElement_generic should be added. This may be a shortcut for the following:


```
sage: LM = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 4, representation='matrix')
sage: e1, e2, f1, f2, h1, h2 = LM.gens()
sage: mh1 = LM.associative_algebra()(dict(h1)); mh1
[ 1  0  0  0]
[ 0 -1  0  0]
[ 0  0 -1  0]
[ 0  0  0  1]
sage: mh1.parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 4 by 4 sparse matrices over Rational Field
```

I made a few small fixes to the documentation and added another test. If my changes look good, then you can set a positive review.
