Keywords: graded modular forms polynomials gsoc 2021

The goal of this ticket is to implement two methods: one for the class `GradedModularFormElement` and one for the class `ModularFormsRing`. 

* The first method is `to_polynomial` that will convert a graded form //F// into a polynomial //P(X_1, X_2,... X_n)// where the //X_i// correspond to the generators of the graded ring of modular forms in which //F// lives. Note that the result of this method is not unique in general. 


```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(1)
sage: f = (M.0)^3 + (M.1)^2;
2 - 288*q + 400032*q^2 + 33473664*q^3 + 796491936*q^4 + 9257371200*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: f.to_polynomial([M.0, M.1])
X^3 + Y^2
```


* The second method is `from_polynomial` that will convert a polynomial into a graded form:


```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(1)
sage: M.from_polynomial(X^3 + Y^2, [M.0, M.1])
2 - 288*q + 400032*q^2 + 33473664*q^3 + 796491936*q^4 + 9257371200*q^5 + O(q^6)
```

The method `_monomials_of_weight` is hidden and it does not make much sense to have an `EXAMPLES` block for this. Furthermore, the code is not properly indented here.

The method `_weights_of_generators` is used only once in the code. It does not make much sense to have it given that its code is a single line.

In the documentation of `polynomial_ring` the generators are not unique. You would better change `Return the polynomial ring of which ``self`` is a quotient.` by `Return a polynomial ring of which ``self`` is a quotient.`.

The method `_monomials_of_weight` is used nowhere. After `:meth:` in the documentation you need to add backticks like `:meth:`my_method``. This was missing in `from_polynomial`.

Instead of

```
iter = 0
poly = 0
for p in monomials.keys():
    poly += soln[iter, 0]*p
    iter += 1
```

you would better write

```
poly = 0 # TODO : this should be the zero polynomial, not the integer 0
for iter, p in enumerate(monomials):
    poly += soln[iter, 0]*p
```

Thank you very much for the comments! Considering the method `_monomials_of_weight`, it is used in `sage/modular/modform/element.py`, line 3563 (for the method `_homogeneous_to_polynomial`). However, it is the only place that it is used. Should I make it not private, or simply erase the method and move the code inside the method `_homogeneous_to_polynomial`?

```

In `_homogeneous_to_polynomial` you call Sturm bound in two places (first one is inside a loop)

```
f[k].parent().sturm_bound()
self[k].parent().sturm_bound()
```

This is always the same value, right? I believe the code would be simpler to read if you initialized a variable

```
sturm_bound = M.modular_forms_of_weight(k).sturm_bound()
```

and use that instead.


There is a `TODO` left in the code

```
poly = 0 # TODO : this should be the zero polynomial, not the integer 0
```

Similarly, in the sum

```
        dict_of_monomials = {}
        for exponents in W:
            monomial_forms = 1; monomial_poly = 1
            iter = 0
            for e, g in zip(exponents, gens):
                monomial_forms *= self(g)**e
                monomial_poly *= poly_parent.gen(iter)**e
                iter += 1
            dict_of_monomials[monomial_poly] = monomial_forms
```

The `monomial_poly` should be the one from the polynomial ring. Not the Python integer one.


In the same piece of code, don't use `;`. Having two statements on the same line is more complicated to read.


I don't understand why the ouptut of `_monomials_of_weight` is a dictionary. The latter is an expensive data structure (involving hasing of the keys). You don't seem to use the dictionary structure anywhere.

```

I'm changing this to *needs work* because I will add input parsing for the element constructor (in order to check if the polynomial is a q-expansion).

Hi David,

I don't like the fact that we rely on variable names to parse user input. What about using univariate (for q-expansion) versus multivariate (for generators)?

Also, you sometimes use `defaults.DEFAULT_VARIABLE` and sometimes the string `'q'`. The usage could be cleaner.

Thank you for your feedback! I decided to drop completely the case for a univariate polynomial. At first, I wanted the code to work even if the number of variables was less or equal to the number of generators, but it turned out to be confusing with q-expansion, so as you said it is better to stick with multivariate polynomials. I also added some details in the documentation in order to make it clearer for the user (is it?). 

For q-expansion, I think it will be better to stick with power series (and not univariate polynomial) instead in order to be consistent with the spaces of weighted modular forms:


```
sage: M = ModularForms(1, 4)
sage: q = polygen(QQ, 'q')
sage: E4 = 1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + 17520*q^4 + 30240*q^5 # Univariate polynomial
sage: M(E4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
sage: P.<q> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: E4 = 1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + 17520*q^4 + 30240*q^5 + O(q^6) # Power series
sage: M(E4)
1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + 17520*q^4 + 30240*q^5 + O(q^6)
```


Moreover, observe that we have the following behavior:


```
sage: P.<q> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: E4 = 1 + 240*q + 2160*q^2 + 6720*q^3 + 17520*q^4 + 30240*q^5 # Exact power series
sage: M(E4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to create modular form from exact non-zero polynomial
```


However, I do find the error message "can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list" not very explicit for the user (but that's an issue for an other ticket).
