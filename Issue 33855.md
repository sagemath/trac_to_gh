```
ERROR: This page was generated by inheriting from "layout.html".

Furo (the documentation theme that this site is generated with) does not support this, and has generated this page. If you are the author of this documentation, please look into why this page was generated using the "layout.html" template and fix the root cause.

Debugging information, if you need to report this error somewhere:
Sphinx: 4.4.0
Furo: 2022.06.21

pagename: index
```

Or perhaps something else changed on our side since #33601?

This seems to only affect the index page, eg https://8f7574169b6743890bc32b58d9d2afcb4a5d6375--sagemath-tobias.netlify.app/reference/ is working. How is the starting page generated?

Indeed. It is generated by `sage_docbuild.WebsiteBuilder` using the template `src/doc/en/website/templates/index.html`, which has the first line `{% extends "layout.html" %}`! It seems this line conflicts with the furo theme.
