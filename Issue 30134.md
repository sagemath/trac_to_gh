After removing the sagelib installation (e.g. using `make sagelib-clean`), one can try to do an editable install (aka `setup.py develop`) to make development more convenient.

This currently fails as follows:

```

I've worked a bit on it. The current commit is a semi-working prototype, in the sense that all cython files are successfully compiled to C files if invoked via `python src/setup.py build_ext --inplace`. The second compilation of the c files does not yet work.

I had problems that none of the source cython files were correctly found on my system (wsl) and that a few dependencies in the current build files were not met (`'linbox', 'Singular', 'm4ri', 'zlib', 'cblas'`). For this reason, I started from scratch and only included what was needed so far. Any pointers to how to install these dependencies (I think they are needed for the second compilation).

Ok, I was under the assumption that the build folder is for build artifacts. If this would be the case, then I suppose it would be better to whitelist those files in the build folder that needs to be checked-in. I've now replaced the global build ignore, by a more fine-grained statement which only ignores the "temporary" files.

Concerning the changes about old Python2 code, I've created #30397.

Thanks for the quick feedback.

I agree the modularization is a good way to approach these problems. Sadly, I feel like this requires too much in-depth knowledge of sage for me to contribute directly. But after skimming the tickets, I suggest you have a look at my changes here to the way distributions are excluded. This seems to be somewhat opposite to say #29864 where this is handled by adding a new setup-tdlib/setup.py. For the in-place installation it is important that the src/setup.py results in a working installation.

What do you suggest as the way forward to align this ticket with the modularization effort?

As for #30578, my motivation here is a bit different: I wanted to have a prototype for sagelib with pipenv that works without ever invoking `sage/make` and directly uses the versions of the dependencies found on pypi instead of (re)building them locally. This seems to work in principle, and might lead to a workable solution for most purposes of development and ci testing, where the advantages of building the dependencies (like optimization) are not that important.

After installing singular via `apt-get install libsingular4-dev libpynac-dev`, a few more pyx files could be compiled. Should I add this in build\pkgs\singular\distros\debian ?

I've now followed your advice, and tried to have a prototype that works if all library dependencies are fulfilled (instead of adding exceptions / distribution annotations everywhere). And I was successful indeed, `import sage.all` works without error and I can do basic calculations with the manifold package. This required tinkering with a lot of system-installed packages (instructions added in the ticket).

The following is not yet working, and I would like to get input on how to resolve this:

Some comments on items in the ticket description:
> TODO (as followup tickets):

`./configure` takes care of all of this. Do you plan to do system interface configuration and system package advice without using `./configure` (or, more generally, Unix shell scripts)?  

A way forward is to reimplement (cleaner version of) some of the simple shell code for system package advice as Python code in `sage_bootstrap`. See #29146.

My suggestion:  Instead of discussing to remove this variable (or other configuration variables that are set by `./configure`), rather discuss different ways of generating the `sage_conf` module / or providing different implementations of the interface defined by the `sage_conf` module for different use cases (such as supporting a platform that does not have a Unix shell).

> - Move package dependencies from pipfile to install_requires in `src/setup.py`. 

Best to put them in `src/setup.cfg` instead of `src/setup.py` (see #30578)

I had a closer look at this, and it turns out that the first time pip is correctly called without any `--no-use-pep517` argument, only on the retry this argument is used. Thus, the error actually shadows another error that occurs during the initial `pip install`.

Can you thus run the following `pipenv run pip install -e . --no-build-isolation` after `pipenv install`. This should point to the real issue why the editable install fails. 

I've created a github workflow because I don't have a mac. https://github.com/tobiasdiez/sage/blob/public/build/inplace/.github/workflows/ci-pipenv.yml It shows the same problem, the `pipenv install` fails apparently due to a pep517 issue, but the editable install actually fails due to missing interpreters and other dependencies (which requires manual installations as in the ticket description).

Thanks for the rebase. Next time please try to not force-push to a branch that others have checked out because it messes up their git history.

I've updated the code to use the new cython options module.

Well, the virtual environment has a `bin/sage` script, so `sage -t` "should" work. If it does not, this needs to be fixed. Likely some work in the direction of #22731 is necessary.

Yeah, `sage -t` still uses the python in `sage/local`. So this does not work, and a mechanism is needed to use the python of the activated virtual env (without changing env variables which is too inflexible in my opinion).

Directly running `bin/sage-runtests --all` also leads to errors:

Thanks for the pointer! I've now added these packages also to the pipfile. However, it is way beyond the scope of this ticket to make the doctest pass in the GH pipenv workflow. There are just so many things that need to be changed in order for the doctests to find the correct dependencies. For example, here are a few relevant error messages:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/mnt/d/Programming/Projects/sage/src/.venv/bin/gap'

RuntimeError: unable to start singular because the command 'Singular -t --ticks-per-sec 1000 --cntrlc=a' failed: The command was not found or was not executable: Singular.

RuntimeError: In order to initialize the database, /__w/sage/sage/src/.venv/share/conway_polynomials/conway_polynomials.p must exist.
```


I know that some of these errors would disappear if one use your recent progress towards installation of sage-build wheels.

Anyway, the aim of this ticket is to create a mostly-working editable install of sagelib. Making the doctests pass relative to this editable install in a venv should be subject of a follow-up ticket.

Yes and no. Since the whole workflow only takes about 2 hours, my hope was that one can use it in the longterm to run it on each push to each branch, replacing/complementing the patchbot. But of course it could also serve as the blueprint for a complete matrix integration test suite.
Anyway, for the moment it serves as a record of the things I did locally on my system, and proofs that the editable install without SAGE_LOCAL works to a large degree.

    "body": "After playing around with it further I was able to make most of the tests pass. There are still a few hundreds that fail (see below for details), most of which are related to issues with maxima (TypeError: unable to start maxima: End Of File (EOF). Exception style platform.) or fpylll (blocked due to https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/185). Since most test pass and there are many subpackages for which all tests pass, I'd say that's enough \"proof of concept\" for this ticket and would leave the rest for follow-up tickets.\n\n\n```\n2020-11-17T19:31:00.7800025Z sage -t --random-seed=0 /__w/sage/sage/src/sage/interacts/debugger.py  #

After playing around with it further I was able to make most of the tests pass. There are still a few hundreds that fail (see below for details), most of which are related to issues with maxima (TypeError: unable to start maxima: End Of File (EOF). Exception style platform.) or fpylll (blocked due to https://github.com/fplll/fpylll/issues/185). Since most test pass and there are many subpackages for which all tests pass, I'd say that's enough "proof of concept" for this ticket and would leave the rest for follow-up tickets.

Ensuring that the feature of installing sagelib on top of conda is not broken is a prerequisite for merging this ticket.

To move this ticket forward, could you help me with this GH Actions test?  (This should be on top of #30944, which still needs review)

I think there should be one new workflow for all tests that do not build the Sage distribution (no `build/pkgs`).

Well, it will be testing something that currently happens to work but is not automatically tested.

> Maybe it's a good idea to review how the GH workflows are structured and revise this if necessary.

All workflows test from-scratch builds of the Sage distribution.

Since the pipfile in this ticket is more uptodate and is welltested (manually and through the added github action), I would actually argue that #30913 should be on top of this ticket.

Moreover, #30770 is the only open dependency of this ticket, so I guess its also more realistic to get this in first.

Without the lock file you wouldn't get a reproducible virtual environment, since pipenv would always use the latest versions (that are compatible with each other). Moreover, the lock file is normally not changed, except if you call `pipenv update`. 
The workflow to update Python packages would then look as follows:
- Run `pipenv update`
- Test
- If everything is fine, create ticket updating pipfile.lock and create a ticket for each updated dependency that is also listed in sage's build/pgks folder.

Will have a look at the other todo's you mention.

(Something like `../sage -sh -c 'PIP_FIND_LINKS=file://$(cd .. && pwd)/local/var/lib/sage/wheels pipenv install -v -v'` similar to what I am testing in #30913.)

I guess the current github workflows don't see this as everything is invoked in one tox command and not in multiple steps (and enviroment variables are only active in each step).

Concerning the cypari error, I have no clue what is needed for it to compile on mac. It's also strange that it works on the github action (for mac as well as linux) but not on your system. cysignals is actually declared in the pipenv file, so it should be installed.

It's not unrealistic, it is working very well for Linux.

OK, I see. 

There are two ways to fix this:

- as described in #30818 ("Set environment for subprocesses invoked by Sage").  Currently subprocesses (such as the gap process invoked by the pexpect-based gap interface) rely on `sage-env` being sourced
- using `pipenv run sage -t` instead of `pipenv run sage-runtests`, which uses `sage-env`.

Well it certainly needs the PARI library! When running `pipenv` outside of the environment set using `sage --sh`, it depends on everything already installed in the system.

From tox.ini comments:

```
    # The variant "local-homebrew-macos-usrlocal" uses the global installation in /usr/local
    # instead.  It may install packages or update packages.  It will not remove packages.
    # Use at your own risk.

The only thing is that since merging the latest develop branch the sage packages (installed via tox) are no longer found when running `pipenv install`.

I've also tried your suggestion with `sage -sh pipenv` but run into several issues. I guess the problem is that pipenv is trying to reuse sages virtual environment.

I've merged the current versions of #30770 and #30912. Not sure what's the purpose of #31362. That would make the line `make maxima conway_polynomials jmol conway_polynomials elliptic_curves combinatorial_designs polytopes_db graphs threejs` obsolete right? If it's just for this somewhat cosmetic improvement, I would suggest to turn around the tables and let #31362 depend on this ticket (and make the changes in the workflow there as well).

This does not sound good. If installing additional packages from the distribution in `SAGE_LOCAL` breaks the proposed setup, then this ticket is definitely not ready.

More in the sense, that it was a bit of try-and-error to find the minimal set of make targets that make the build pass. You could have course build every package in the sage distribution, but the point is that with pipenv only a couple of them are actually needed.

Also as I just wrote in #31377, some of the code setting flags is missing, which is causing errors. Could you look into unifying this please when you have a chance?

Hi Vincent, thanks for joining the discussion.

For a discussion of possible distribution strategies using wheels, let's use #31251 (Meta-ticket: Distribution as wheels), which also has a link to a recent post by Gommers on packaging. I agree with you that it is a hard problem.

For Sage 9.3, I have a much more modest goal regarding wheels that is already fully implemented and is only waiting for review (see ticket list in #29705 for tickets by milestone). Since #29500 (already in Sage 9.2), we generate wheels in `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/wheels`. These wheels are not distributable as they do not bundle their shared library dependencies but rather rpath into `$SAGE_LOCAL`. Users can make their own venvs for development purposes where they install the prebuilt wheels from this directory. #31045 and #31279 add some missing wheels. #30913 generates dependency metadata that makes it easier to set up the venv; and adds tests using `tox`.

For editable install of sagelib as part of the normal build system (no extra venv) using Tobias' new `setup.py` from this ticket, see #31377.

These problems don't occur if you use the lock file (and subsequently `pipenv lock`).

Anyway, because there are pros and cons for each approach I would suggest to see how it goes with the lock file committed (as strongly recommended by pipenv). If it turns out that the disadvantages overweight we can always remove it later again.

I understand that for general Python projects it has the benefit that you describe (although the benefit over plain `requirements.txt` is still not clear to me, but let's not elaborate on this now).

The problem is that in our case, adding the lock file locks versions that (1) are *not the same* as the ones in the Sage distribution, (2) it will be out of date next week because we have no established process to update it. So it reduces clarity for users and creates a maintenance burden for Sage development.

I think it would be a good idea to work on a process (= script/documentation) based on pipenv that actually helps Sage developers to make Python package upgrades. Currently this is a manual process based on guesswork and testing. So this could be a key added value that Pipenv provides.

Maybe a shift in viewpoint might be helpful to see how pipenv helps. Sagelib (things in `src`) declares its dependencies in form of `install_requires`. Currently, sage-the-distrubition is one way to provide a certain set of packages that satisfy the version constraints. The newly added pipfile.lock specifies another set of packages that also satisfy the constraints. If sagelib is indeed configured correctly, then it should work with both sets. So you can see the added github workflow as a test that the install_requires constraints are correct.

dependabot or rennovate are the modern approaches to not worry about manually updating dependencies. But they don't support trac...
But updating the pipfile lock manually is easy, automated and only needs to be done rarely. Its definitively more convenient then updating the versions in sage-the-distro.

I don't find this convincing. A checked-in `Pipfile.lock` is just the result of resolving the declared version constraints (as of some point in the past) against what was available on the index at some some point in the past.

When the workflow fails, it will mean just one thing: Constraints were updated and Pipfile.lock was not updated (-> maintenance burden).

It's more valuable to test on GH Actions whether the declared version constraints resolve *at the current time* to a set of versions that work correctly. If this fails, it is clear that the constraints declared in `install_requires` are not correct.

It was actually something strange going on on my system. After make distclean I could run sage-env locally and then also in the github action. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for your help.

The update mode was a bit more work than I'd liked but its running now. See https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/runs/3926515272?check_suite_focus=true for an example output. It can be activated by running the workflow manually from the github interface (after it is merged into the default branch).

Sorry for not testing it after my last merge of the develop branch.

It turned out there is a problem (only reported by pipenv using the `--verbose` flag) during the installation of sage in the virtual environment. In fact, it turns out that this is not related at all to pipenv but a general issue with the installation using build isolution, so I've opened #32904 for this.

For pipenv this can be fixed by running 

```
pipenv run pip install -e . --upgrade --exists-action=i --no-build-isolation
```
 
after the initial build of the venv. I've changed the ticket description accordingly.

I haven't looked at all of the failures to see what else is there.

Thanks for testing!

Some failing tests are to be expected since pipenv is rather different to the existing way to use sage (as part of sage-the-distribution). But I think for the modularization effort this ticket gives a helpful testcase how sage performs in a "pip-installable" environment.

I also had problems with gap (for the github action) and fixed it by manually setting the SAEG_LOCAL env variable. I guess there is potential for improvement as follow-up tickets but I'm not the right person to work on this as I'm not familiar with these parts of sage.
