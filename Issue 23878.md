Wait, so if we're getting rid of `ContinuedFractionField`, what is the right way to get continued fractions for real numbers?

```
sage: continued_fraction(pi)
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]
```

Okay.  I think it would be useful to have `continued_fraction` methods on real numbers and elements of the symbolic ring, but that can be for another ticket.

LGTM (the patchbot failure should be handled by #24337).
