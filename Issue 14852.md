The `seed` keyword seems to be ignored/ineffective when used to initialize a GSL probability distribution.  However the `.set_seed()` method seems to behave better.  So the logic to use a seed must be there, so maybe the problem is not too serious.

I have not investigated further (scope, or explanation).  I do not think this is related to #9770, though it looks similar.

The init methods of `RealDistribution`, `GeneralDiscreteDistribution` and `SphericalDistribution` all handle the `seed == None` case, but otherwise fail to copy a value of the seed keyword into `self.seed` before making use of it.  Could be three one-line fixes, just capture this value from the keyword into the class.
