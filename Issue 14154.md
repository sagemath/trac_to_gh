We have been running the sage worksheets as an unprivileged user. The setup is as follows.

1. A user, say user1, starts the sage server remotely using

```
sage -n port=8888 accounts=True interface='' server_pool=['sagenb@localhost'] openid=True automatic_login=False port_tries=0 directory=/home/user1/a.sagenb
```

2. Because of the server_pool command, any worksheet is opened as an unprivileged user called sagenb.
3. With default sage-5.2 there is no problem with this and everything works.
4. With sage-5.2 + "#13121 without new jmol", jmol works but one needs to close the worksheet and then reopen the worksheet and then the jmol pops up.
5. With sage-5.2 + #13121, jmol works partially:
   1. First, the static image can not be created and there is a permission denied error. See [attachment:permission_error.jpg].
   2. However, once the 3D output is toggled, jmol loads fine. The permission denied error is still there.
   3. The error obtained is of the form

```
script ERROR: script ERROR: io error reading
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip|SCRIPT:
java.io.FileNotFoundException:
/home/user1/a.sagenb/home/__store__/0/09/098/098f/te\
st/0/cells/7/sage0-size500-499889951.jmol.zip (Permission denied)
Sleeping...Make Interactive
```

6. When run locally, i.e., without server_pool, the jmol loads and runs fine. For instance, this is fine:

```
sage -n directory=a.sagenb
```


This problem has made it difficult for me to upgrade a server from 5.2 and I think the error is introduced by some change in jmol. The error itself stems from some java component. A diff of the changes between the directory `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sagenb/sagenb/data/sage3d` for sage-5.2 and sage-5.7.rc0 has not yielded any difference. So, I believe the difference is really in the jmol spkg introduced in #12299.

I've complained about it a while ago: #13978

jmol files for the image are stored in some cell directory with permissions 0700 for the server user, thus worker processes cannot get access to them.

This is not the problem. Or, at least, it wasn't the problem before sage-5.4. The permissions have always been 0700 (belonging to the server user), and it has remained the same for years. I am not sure how it worked earlier, but it did use to work.

The problem is the the worker processes may be restricted in their users and groups - for instance I have been running a server using sagenb:sagenb as the user/group for the worker process, and this user belongs to no other groups, and no other user shares this group sagenb.

If the change is only in granting of permissions, then the server user should have the same group as the worker and the permissions should be probably 0740 or 0750.

Linux sage4 3.2.1-gentoo-r2 #15 SMP Tue May 15 10:40:50 CEST 2012 x86_64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5660 @ 2.80GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
```


```
Sage Version 5.12, Release Date: 2013-10-07
```

I am using the patch from #11679, but I don't see how that could make a difference.

Notebook started with

```
server_pool = ['worker@sage3', 'worker@sage4']
ulimit='-v 1200000 -t 86400'


# Import sage library
from sage.all_cmdline import *

notebook(
        port=8081,
        secure=False,
        accounts=False,
        automatic_login=False,
        quiet=True,
        timeout=3600*3,
        ulimit=ulimit,
        server_pool=server_pool)
```


The workers most certainly do not have access to the server's `.sage` directory (it can even be on a different machine!) but JMol works...

Since we want the `server_pool` thing to keep working, changing permissions is not the right solution, since you should assume that the workers can only access `/tmp` (or whatever temporary directory you choose with #11679).

I just ran an `strace` on the worker process and there is only one point where it even tries to access the `.sage` directory (called `dotsage` in my case):

```
open("/home/sagenb/dotsage/sage_notebook.sagenb/home/J.Demeyer/197/data/c_lib.pyx", O_RDONLY) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
```

(this is because that directory is added to `sys.path` of the worker, see `sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py`, see #3844)

The worker creates a `jmol.zip` file:

```
open("sage0-size500-863868640.jmol.zip", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
```

but it does so after

```
chdir("/var/sage/tmpmJfHuO")            = 0
```

(`/var/sage` plays the role of `/tmp` in my setup and is shared between the server and the workers).
