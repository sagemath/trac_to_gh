Keywords: IMA coding sprint, CHAs, ordered multiset partitions

The free (noncommutative) algebra generated by finite nonempty sets is given a Hopf algebra structure, with coproduct on finite sets `K` given by `\Delta(K) = \sum_{I \sqcup J = K} I \otimes J`.

This Hopf algebra gives formulas for primitives and antipode in other (combinatorial) Hopf algebras via "transfer of structure" as described in [LM2018]. This transfer was already implemented (in the special case of NCSYM) via :meth:`

It would be nice to implement this transfer for other cases. Getting this Hopf algebra and its dual within [SageMath](SageMath) would be a good first step.

Some more superficial comments:

- I would rename `OMPBasis_OMPNSym` to `OMPNSymBasis_abstract` (at least, that is my understanding of its role).
- Remove the period here: `around which the primitive is built.`
- This is overindented:
  {{{
        .. TODO::

            - sort out the degree issues above. (search for "wrong!!!")
  }}}
- For this:
  {{{
.. TODO: Do we need these tests, or are they checked within TestSuite?::
   }}}
   the answer is yes, they are checked by the `_test_antipode` unless I am misremembering something.
- `.. MATH::` needs a blankline before it (see `coproduct_on_basis`).
- I would put the `TestSuite` tests in the `__init__` method rather than the class-level doc.
- `*Warning:*` -> `.. WARNING::`.
- The `__classcall_private__` will need doctests.
