Keywords: interact slider notebook

It would be useful if the slider object in an `@`interact could display it's value in different formats. Right now, if the slider value is a float and `display_value=True`  the value is displayed to the maximum precision 

One proposal is to enhance the `display_value` parameter to the slider object so that it will accept arguments like `"%3.2f"` which would change how the slider value is displayed.
