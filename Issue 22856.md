CC:  rws

Keywords: assumptions, var

The `real_part` method of a variable in the integer domain behaves unexpectedly,


```
sage: SR.var('x', domain='integer').real_part()
real_part(x)
```


compare to


```
sage: SR.var('x', domain='real').real_part()
x
```

You can get the desired result by explicitly doing `assume(x,'real')`. Is it the case that `integer` should be implying `real`? Gaussian integers aren't real ... (but then the algebraic integers aren't discrete in R, so perhaps that's not what `integer` means).

well, true, one can add that as an additional assumption, and I don't know if `integer` should be implying `real` in the most general case in Sage.

the use case at hand was an expression involving complex exponentials and some variables that are discretized, hence the integer assumption [(integers being understood as a subset of the real numbers.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)

Internally in Pynac there are the info flags `Ã¬nteger` and `cinteger` and the internal `bool numeric::is_cinteger()` uses `py_is_cinteger` which looks like `return py_is_integer(x) or (py_is_crational(x) and py_denom(x) == 1)`, but the functions are buggy (maybe since the parent of `I` changed some time ago):

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import py_is_crational_for_doctest
sage: py_is_crational_for_doctest(1)
True
sage: py_is_crational_for_doctest(2*I)
False
sage: py_is_cinteger_for_doctest(2*I)
False
```

`is_cinteger` is not used in Pynac. For crational I opened the (unrelated to this ticket) https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/253 because it's used in Pynac. It's not exposed to the Sage user.

So from the info flag level integer would mean real integer, so this ticket is about a bug in Pynac with setting flags in `symbol::set_domain`. I cannot say atm if there are more bugs revealed in consequence.

This also means that the docstring for `x.is_integer?` should be adapted to this because `Expression.is_integer()` directly queries the integer info flag.

Merging the dependency makes the failing tests pass. However the problem is uncovered that the added doctests change `x` to integer, making subsequent tests fail.

So I just merged the dependency and added `forget()`.
