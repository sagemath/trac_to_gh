Don't we want to remove unnecessary `keys()` here `list(x_sol.keys())`?

If you don't really care about this nitpick, feel free to set a positive review.

Hmm, the `.keys()` here is maybe not so innocent. Trying to remove it got me a `MemoryError`, so I would prefer not touch that for the moment.

Curious. I wouldn't know offhand why that is happening. Thank you for checking.
