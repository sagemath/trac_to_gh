PermutationGroup can handle permutations on any set, and not only 1..n. Given that the designs are defined on `range(v)`, let us avoid some mistakes !

Before

```
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(7,3).automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(4,5)(6,7), (4,6)(5,7), (2,3)(6,7), (2,4)(3,5), (1,2)(5,6)]
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(7,3).points()            
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```


After


```
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(7,3).automorphism_group()
Permutation Group with generators [(2,4)(5,6), (2,5)(4,6), (1,2)(3,4), (0,1)(4,6)]
sage: designs.BalancedIncompleteBlockDesign(7,3).points()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Yo !

Done.

Ahem. I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything, I mean *really* I depend on the work you do when you review tickets because if nobody reviews tickets I am just stuck, and unable to write new code... But for some reason you look like you are "stuck" when something needs a rebase, and there is absolutely nothing on earth that prevents you from fixing merge conflicts... `:-P`

Branch updated !
