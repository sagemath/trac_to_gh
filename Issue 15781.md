Using the underlying GAP commands it takes forever to iterate over conjugacy classes of the Symmetric group. In this ticket we implement a very simple and very naive one that does the job.

I iterate over partitions `l` of `n` and construct a permutation representative by

(1,2, ... l<sub>1</sub>) (l<sub>1</sub>+1, ... l<sub>1</sub>+l<sub>2</sub>) ... (l<sub>1</sub>+...+l<sub>k-1</sub>, .. n)

where `k` is the length of `l`. Here's my timings:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.08 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(12)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
10 loops, best of 3: 29.5 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(25)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.06 s per loop

sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes()
10 loops, best of 3: 99.3 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(12)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.1 s per loop
```
Without my branch:

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1 loops, best of 3: 55.8 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(12)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1 loops, best of 3: 565 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(25)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes_representatives()
1 loops, best of 3: 14.5 s per loop

sage: S = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes()
10 loops, best of 3: 115 ms per loop
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(12)
sage: %timeit S.conjugacy_classes()
1 loops, best of 3: 1.23 s per loop
```
So we get about 14x-20x speedup in the representative function, but surprisingly, minimal gain in listing all conjugacy classes. Anyways, I think this is an improvement. I've also added a specific iterator method for the conjugacy classes.

Hi Travis,

The title of the ticket was perhaps not clear enough, I wanted to iterate through the elements of a given conjugacy class... Let us assume that the purpose changed ;-)

Ah, so the description should have been something like:

Using the underlying GAP commands it takes forever to iterate over *a conjugacy class* of the Symmetric group. In this ticket we implement a very simple and very naive one that does the job.

I'd definitely like to speed that up as well. Do you have that code to iterate over a particular conjugacy class? I'm happy to add that onto here and review it.

A question, do you think should we add similar methods to `Permutations_n`?

I do. Let me add it to the branch.

I don't know. Most of the time I found that playing with classes makes life harder and I mostly program using tuple and/or lists (this is what my iterator is). One way to make it would be:
- have this iterator (somehow hidden) that output lists
- use it for both `SymmetricGroup` and `Permutations_n`

What do you think?
