The command '/bin/sh -c sudo $SAGE_ROOT/sage --nodotsage -c "install_scripts('/usr/bin')"' returned a non-zero code: 1
```


The problem is that `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION` is not being set properly when running `$SAGE_ROOT/sage`.

This is because there are *two* copies of `sage-env-config`, where `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION` is defined:  One under `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` and one other `$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`.  This is normal when doing Sage development, and I believe, if it exists, it's the one under `src/bin` that will be used by default when developing/building.

The problem in this case is that although the one in `local/bin` correctly has `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=3`, the one in `src/bin` still has `SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=2` for some reason.

I wonder if this is a remnant from an earlier build stage that was cached, but not properly updated for some reason (I thought that different `--build-arg` flags would avoid use incompatible cached images built with different `--build-arg`s, but it's possible that that arg isn't being included in the build early enough.

Replying to [comment:11 saraedum]:
> What the `bdist-clean`? Is this a automake target? Otherwise is it reasonable that the build system's config is visible after running it?

No, this is just a pseudo-target in Sage's top-level Makefile.  I have no idea why specifically it's named that.  It's also used by the `fast-rebuild-clean` target.  It just calls `clean` (which is in `build/make/Makefile` for some reason), and then `misc-clean`.

All `clean` does apparently is:


```
clean:
    @echo "Deleting package build directories..."
    rm -rf "$(SAGE_LOCAL)/var/tmp/sage/build"
```


which is certainly worth doing.  But maybe this needs to be detangled a bit...

For Odile's use I went ahead and pushed a prototype of this up to Dockerhub: sagemath/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha

Unfortunately it still has a bug.  The `sage-entrypoint` still tries to run `make build` (understandably) which results in re-configuring (needlessly) and breaking things.

A workaround for now is to set the PREREQ_OPTIONS variable which is used by Sage's top-level Makefile when it runs configure.  So you can set this when running the container like:


```
docker run -ti --rm -e PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3' sagemath/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
```


Next up, I think we should modify the Docker build to at least keep config.status so that this doesn't keep happening.

Apparently I was not able to successfully upload the Docker image to hub.docker.com because (AFAICT) of [this issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/33558#issuecomment-510479853).

But I was able to upload it to our image registry on gitlab.com.   So try:


```
docker run -ti --rm -e PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3' registry.gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
```


You can also use this image as a base for another Docker image by doing something like:


```
FROM registry.gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/sage/sagemath-dev-py3:alpha
ENV PREREQ_OPTIONS='--with-python=3'
...
```


That is, you would ensure `PREREQ_OPTIONS` is set as an environment variable in the new image, by default.

This is not ideal and should be fixed, but it's a start anyways...
