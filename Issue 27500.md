Keywords: polytopes, non-rational

With #25097, we have:


```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[AA(sqrt(2)),1]], backend='normaliz')
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,1],[1,0]], backend='normaliz')
sage: P & Q
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'sage.modules.free_module_element.FreeModuleElement_generic_dense' and 'list'
```
