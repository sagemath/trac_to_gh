Follow-up from #29113 ("Reimplement `sage -i SPKG` for optional/experimental packages as `configure --enable-SPKG && make build`").

Isn't a space missing between "passing" and "$ENABLE_ARGS" here?

```
+        echo >&2 "to be installed by passing$ENABLE_ARGS to ./configure"
```

$ENABLE_ARGS should contain a leading space: it's defined by the line

```
ENABLE_ARGS="$ENABLE_ARGS '--enable-$PKG'"
```

adding `" '--enable-...'"` (including a leading space) each time it's updated.
