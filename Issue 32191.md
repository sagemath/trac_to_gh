CC:  mkoeppe tscrim dimpase

Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in sage.combinat, sage.graphs).

Here we avoid the use of `Integer(round(p.solve(...)))` whenever possible.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32428

This is a proposal for avoiding some calls to `Integer(round(...))` on the objective value. To do so, we use our new functionalities. It is cleaner this way.

I think a better solution would be to just recompute the objective function on the retrieved solution instead of getting it from the solver.

I only have a small doubt about parameter `objective_only` of method `solve`. It seems that it is not used so it's ok. Otherwise, we may (really?) be in a situation in which we have the objective value but not the values of the variables.
