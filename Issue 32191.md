Part of #32191 (Meta-ticket: Audit/fix all uses of `MixedIntegerLinearProgram` in sage.combinat, sage.graphs).

Here we avoid the use of `Integer(round(p.solve(...)))` whenever possible.

This is a proposal for avoiding some calls to `Integer(round(...))` on the objective value. To do so, we use our new functionalities. It is cleaner this way.

I think a better solution would be to just recompute the objective function on the retrieved solution instead of getting it from the solver.

I only have a small doubt about parameter `objective_only` of method `solve`. It seems that it is not used so it's ok. Otherwise, we may (really?) be in a situation in which we have the objective value but not the values of the variables.

Probably better not to pass it to `solve`.

I agree. I have removed the parameter from calls to solve.

```
+            obj = sum(in_cut[u, v] for u, v in g.edge_iterator(labels=False) if in_cut[u, v])
```

This can be simplified to `sum(1 for ...)`

Right. done.

This one too:

```
+            obj = sum(in_cut[frozenset((u, v))]
+                          for u, v in g.edge_iterator(labels=False) if in_cut[frozenset((u, v))])
```

LGTM; green bot => positive review

so then. Thank you for the review.

To go further (maybe in a follow-up ticket
given the two-weeks-old positive review):


```diff
-            obj = sum(1 for u, v in g.edge_iterator(labels=False) if in_cut[frozenset((u, v))])
+            obj = sum(1 for uv in g.edge_iterator(labels=False) if in_cut[frozenset(uv)])
```



```diff
-    p.set_objective(p.sum(in_set[1, v] for v in g))
+    p.set_objective(p.sum(1 for v in g if in_set[1, v]))
```

I agree for the first remark, but not for the second. The objective function needs variables ;)

Resolution: fixed
