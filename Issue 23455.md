I played around with the code and it looks good! Thank you for implementing this, Travis!

One thing I noticed is that the links from the crystal index to kac_modules do not work (same for the odd negative roots part) even after running `make` several times.

Forgot to add it to the module list. Now it should be there.

They still do not appear here:

This should fix the links in the catalog.

Ok, looks good to me now! Ben, are you also satisfied?

Ben and I took a look at it today, and we found a bug with how we were computing the inner products and what the fundamental weights should be. So now the weights of the Kac modules are considered to be dominant by Sage.

Green bot. (Mostly for Frédéric: the `iteritems()` is a call on a `vector` object, not a `dict`, so it is Python3 compatible.) Just needs someone to flip the switch.
