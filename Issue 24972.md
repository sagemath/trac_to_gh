CC:  vdelecroix

Keywords: PowerSeries, LaurentSeries

Currently (sage-8.1), only square roots can be taken of power series, and Laurent series don't even implement that.  The goal is calculations like this:


```
sage: K.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 't', 5)
sage: (t^3)^(1/3)
t
sage: (1+t)^(1/3)
1 + 1/3*t - 1/9*t^2 + 5/81*t^3 - 10/243*t^4 + O(t^5)

sage: x = Frac(QQ[['x']]).0
sage: g = 1/x^10 - x + x^2 - x^4 + O(x^8)
sage: g^(1/2)
x^-5 - 1/2*x^6 + 1/2*x^7 - 1/2*x^9 + O(x^13)
sage: g^(1/5)
x^-2 - 1/5*x^9 + 1/5*x^10 - 1/5*x^12 + O(x^16)
```

The patch works by renaming the PowerSeries sqrt() method to nth_root() and extending its logic to handle any integer root.  sqrt() method is now just a wrapper around nth_root().

PowerSeries and LaurentSeries pow() methods now check for a fractional power and evaluate it by calling nth_root().

This branch was not written with a recent enough version of Sage. It is adding a method `nth_root` to the class `PowerSeries` but a method called `nth_root` was recently (8.2.beta2, January 1st 2018) added to the same class in #10720. The merge commit 2864e95 is the commit which creates two methods with the same name in the same class.

With this brach, the git log on the file `power_series_ring_element.pyx` gives:

OK, let's try this again...

I discarded my version of nth_root() and rebased the other changes to use the nth_root() that was added in December 2017.

There were some bugs in that version of nth_root() that I fixed.  Not sure if that should be a separate ticket.  I left it in with this one because otherwise the tests for this ticket's code would fail.

laurent_series_ring_element.pyx:

1. Add spaces around operators `right=QQ(r)` should be `right = QQ(r)` (idem `right=int(r)` in `power_series_ring_element.pyx`)

2. `right = QQ(r)` is very bad

```
sage: QQ(1.3)
13/10
```

  You should rather use `QQ.coerce(r)`.

3. `ZZ(val / d)` is a bad way of testing whether `d` divides `val`. Simply do

```
if val % d:
    raise ValueError
```

   And then, don't use `val / d` (that produces rational number) but `val // d`.

3. You define `P = self._parent` but then never use it!

power_series_ring_element.pyx:

1. Remove the import of `ZZ` that you do not use.

2. In

```
Check precision on `O(x^r)`::

    sage: O(x^4).nth_root(2)
    O(x^2)
    sage: O(x^4).nth_root(4)
    O(x^1)
```

   could you add tests for `O(x^m).nth_root(k)` where `k` does not divide `m`.

I did puzzle for a while about how to handle something like `O(x^4).nth_root(3)`.  Should this return `O(x^1)` or `O(x^2)`?

An argument can be made for `O(x^2)`.  After all, if there's a first degree term, then cubing it will result in a third degree term, which is impossible.  So maybe this calculation should be rounded *up*.

I opted for `O(x^1)` (rounding *down*), since it seems more conservative.

The logic in

```
    right = int(r)
    if right == r:
        return type(self)(self._parent, self.__u**right, self.__n*right)
 
    try:
        right = QQ.coerce(r)
```

is quite strange. You first convert `r` to a Python integer, then test equality with the former `right` and then coerce to `QQ`. As a consequence you have misleading error messages

```
sage: K.<t> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 't', 5)
sage: (t^3) ^ "3"
...
ValueError: exponent must be a rational number
sage: sage: (t^3) ^ "1/3"
...
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1/3'
```

I would rather do the other way around

1. coerce to QQ and raise appropriate error if not possible
2. then treat the case ZZ vs QQ in a `if/else` statement

this is weird

```
sage: K.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ, 't', 5)
sage: (O(t^-2))^(1/2)
O(t^-1)
sage: (t^-4 + O(t^-2))^(1/2)
t^-2 + O(1)
```

I think that makes sense.  The relative precision remains the same on powering operations.


```
sage: a = (t^-4 + O(t^-2))^(1/2)
sage: a
t^-2 + O(1)
sage: a^2
t^-4 + O(t^-2)
