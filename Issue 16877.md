# Issue 16877: Linebreaking and html escaping on notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2014-10-08 12:41:55

`for i in range(65, 75): print '.' * i + '>'` yields to line ending with "&g\", next line starting with "t;". Somehow escaping of html codes is broken.

Pretty sure that is a bug in sagenb, not sage itself.
