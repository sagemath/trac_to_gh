Keywords: hypergeometric trace formula

It seems that in earlier tickets meant to speed up the computation of the hypergeometric trace formula (especially #28902), the optimization of using symmetry in the trace formula for `p**f` when `f>1` did not get applied fully. Here we address this.

The status quo:

```
sage: from sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive import HypergeometricData as Hyp
sage: H = Hyp(cyclotomic=([4,2,2],[3,3]))
sage: time H.padic_H_value(next_prime(4096), 2, 1337)
CPU times: user 47.9 s, sys: 456 ms, total: 48.4 s
Wall time: 48.4 s
-5526
```

This is already beating Magma (v2.24-9):

```
> H := HypergeometricData([4,2,2],[3,3]);
> time HypergeometricTrace(H, 1/1337, 4099^2);
-5526
Time: 84.140
```

But there is still room for improvement. (Restart Sage to suppress cacheing.)

```
sage: from sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive import HypergeometricData as Hyp
sage: H = Hyp(cyclotomic=([4,2,2],[3,3]))
sage: time H.padic_H_value(next_prime(4096), 2, 1337)
CPU times: user 32.9 s, sys: 1.1 s, total: 34 s
Wall time: 34 s
-5526
```

I thought of another improvement: since we only implement parameter values in Q, I can consolidate from `q-1` to `p-1` terms in `hgm_coeffs`. This speeds things up some more:

```
sage: from sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive import HypergeometricData as Hyp
sage: H = Hyp(cyclotomic=([4,2,2],[3,3]))
sage: time H.padic_H_value(next_prime(4096), 2, 1337)
CPU times: user 24 s, sys: 255 ms, total: 24.3 s
Wall time: 24.3 s
-5526
```

As a bonus, cacheing this result takes much less memory.

Let me sleep on this a bit before putting this up for review, to see if I'm missing another easy trick.
