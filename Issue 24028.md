# Issue 24028: py3: fixes to sage.misc.fpickle module

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24265

Miscellaneous fixes to the `sage.misc.fpickle` module for Python 3 support.

I confirmed that all the module's tests passed on Python 3.  This also fixed some errors in tests that relied on this indirectly (e.g. through pickling of methods).

Looks good, but shall we keep the call to the attribute "im_name" ? I thought it also disappeared in py3.

This code isn't accessing an `im_name` attribute anywhere that I can see.  It's just using `im_name` as a variable name.
