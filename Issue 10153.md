# Issue 10153: document Sage's use of MPLCONFIGDIR

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10154

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2010-10-22 15:30:20

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: matplotlib environment

In #6235, we set the matplotlib config directory MPLCONFIGDIR to a subdirectory of the user's .sage directory, to avoid issues when switching between versions of matplotlib.  We need to document this somewhere, probably in the installation guide, in the section about environment variables.

Applied patch, rebuilt documentation with 'sage -docbuild installation html' and I see that the new documentation is installed.  It looks like it makes sense. Positive review!
