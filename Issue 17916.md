We just add support to the following

```

sage: libgap.eval('infinity').sage()
+Infinity
```

DRY: `__int__` is just `self.sage(ring=int)`.

There is also `IsNegInfinity` for negative infinity...

Right! I did implement a `_gap_init_` method. That way even the gap interface gets some benefit in it.
