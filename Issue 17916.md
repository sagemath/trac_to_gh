We just add support to the following

```
sage: int(libgap(3))

sage: libgap.eval('infinity').sage()
+Infinity
```

DRY: `__int__` is just `self.sage(ring=int)`.

There is also `IsNegInfinity` for negative infinity...

How about also adding the other way, libgap(oo) should do the right thing.... e.g. by adding a `_libgap_` method to `sage.rings.infinity.PlusInfinity`. Then you could also clean up the docstrings, the raw `libgap.eval` isn't what you would want to show to users.

Right! I did implement a `_gap_init_` method. That way even the gap interface gets some benefit in it.
