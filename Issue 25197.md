I strongly believe that `PathTableaux` should not be a category. You should just have an abstract base class (ABC) for the `*Tableau` objects (the `ElementMethods` is currently playing this role, but you're using a sledgehammer in place of a ball-peen). It is something that is easy to change back if there becomes a practical use/need for the category, but I think it puts more distance between the concrete class and the ABC code, which makes it harder to maintain.

At this point, I am thinking it might be best to make a new folder in the `combinat` folder called `tableau` with your new code (one file for the ABC and your other two files). Then it will become the eventual home for all tableau files (but moving those should be done on separate tickets).

Some other misc comments:

- What is this doing here: `#!/usr/bin/env python2`?
- I would call the method `plot` instead of `draw`.
- Your `drawL` and `drawC` might be best as separate standalone functions in the ABC file. Otherwise if you feel that they should be methods, then make them hidden by calling them `_drawL` and `_drawC`.
- I don't see the point of having `draw_partition` in `drawL` as an internal helper function (in `drawC`, it makes sense because of the two `for` loops and avoiding code duplication).
- There are a bunch of malformatted docstrings (`EXAMPLES:` -> `EXAMPLES::` (or missing altogether) when followed by code, which should be indented by 1), and some that should be at the class level or at the top of the module.
- The copyright should be comments, not part of the docstring.

Hi Travis, Thank you for the feedback.

"At this point, I am thinking it might be best to make a new folder in the combinat folder called tableau with your new code (one file for the ABC and your other two files). Then it will become the eventual home for all tableau files (but moving those should be done on separate tickets)."

Could you please expand on this? I understand your suggestion to use an ABC instead of a category.
I am not clear on how this should be done within the trac system.
I understand that I could open a new ticket, copy the files by hand,
and at some point delete the existing ticket. However I suspect you may mean a different approach.

Is the first step to create a new ticket with the new folder called tableau containing just one
file with the ABC?

I understand this to mean my code could construct the wrong graph but this test would not notice
if it happened to have the same adjacency matrix. Really? or did you mean something else?
> I don't see why you have a `PathTableaux` class. It look like it is a very malformed parent.
Could you please expand on this? I take malformed to be pejorative. I will want these to be (finite) enumerated sets but I haven't thought this through yet.

Now you have a proper parent and element. So that part is a good improvement over trying to do things with categories.

A naming convention, you should call the folder `path_tableaux`. For filenames, etc. that are all lowercase, words are separated by underscores `_`.

I believe you are better using `ClonableArray` instead of `ClonableList` because your object should be a fixed length because it is effectively immutable.

All methods need a doctest, including `__classcall_private__` and the abstract `_local_rule`.

Instead of `display`, the somewhat standard argument name is `verbose`.

I think your `__getattr__` hack is dangerous and violates the principle of least surprise. It is dangerous because suppose you have two `PathTableau` that convert to each other but neither implements a given method. My understanding is that would lead to an infinite loop. It is also slow because it has to do and then check for each such conversion. Nor does not dispatch to base classes, which might interfere with some of the hacks of the category framework (I would have to check this one specifically, but this might not be an issue because this is not a Cython class).

This is also extremely brittle as it depends heavily on implementations in other unrelated classes (violating code locality) and the result depends strongly on the order of `_conversions`. Which brings me to the violation the principle of least surprise. Suddenly you get a `DyckPath` instead of a `PathTableau` when asking for a method that might be natural or nonsense:

```
sage: t = CatalanTableau([0,1,2,3,2,1,0])
sage: t.to_DyckWord()
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
sage: _.reverse()
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
sage: t.reverse()
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

These are `PathTableau`, so either you implement methods directly there or you explicitly convert.

The rest of it mostly looks good other than perhaps a few small formatting tweaks. I can address those once the above is taken care of.

Realized that I should probably focus on this one before (or at least concurrently with) oscillating tableau. Travis has hopefully covered all the bases in terms of the programming technicalities (and should probably confirm before this gets a final positive review), I'll focus more on doc/usability.

Some of my previous comments from oscillating tableau actually apply to this ticket (I didn't realize this ticket was being pulled into oscillating tableau ticket as a dependency).

* Adding the underscores to the folder/file names requires a few other lines to be changed.

Finally, in CatalanTableaux, the link `:class:`sage.combinat.pathtableau.pathtableaux`` needs to be updated to `:class:`sage.combinat.path_tableau.path_tableaux``.

* As with OscillatingTableaux, the docstrings for CatalanTableaux need to be moved from _classcall_private_ up to the class itself.

* `descents` method needs some sort of definition, because in particular, whatever definition is used here doesn't agree with my first idea of what it should be (i appearing in a row below i+1 in the associated two row tableau.

* `to_perfect_matching` should first check to see if the tableau is skew, and give an appropriate error message (rather than having the call to DyckWord fail).

`EXAMPLE::` -> `EXAMPLES::` which should also have a blankline after it.

Many methods do not have doctests.

Remove the `CylndricalDiagram.__str__` and change the `__repr__` -> `_repr_`. You should also implement an `_ascii_art_` (and possibly a `_unicode_art_`) and have `pp` call that.

For the `_test_involution`, I would move the `all` out and do an explicit `for` loop that tests each pair (better control of what fails). Also this way you can also use `tester._max_runs` in case `size()` is really big.

`PathTableau` should inherit from `ClonableArray`. IMO your divider comments in that class should be indented to make it easier to read too.

I don't see the point of the `_rule` function in `_local_rule`. Just put that in the `for` loop.

What follows after an `INPUT:` block should *not* be indented.

The docstring for `catalan.py` should be first, not the copyright

I have fixed the above.

The method without a doctest is _element_constructor_ on line 422

I am not sure when this gets called. I assume it has been called several times implicitly in the existing doctests and I don't know what an explicit doctest would do.

I am inclined to agree with you. It probably would be best as a catalog of the form `path_tableaux.Name` and have that be in the global namespace.

There are also a few places (e.g., in `to_word()`) that need the docstring to being `r"""` (although I would argue you should essentially always do this to be safe). 

There are also a few other places where the docstrings are not formatted for Sage (`cactus` has `$`'s, `PathTableaux` really has a one-line docstring (instead of having the `"""` on their own lines), one-line docstrings should end in a period/full-stop, etc.) However these are very minor things.
