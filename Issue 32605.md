Currently, `FiniteField_ntl_gf2eElement` calls generic-group `discrete_log()` to compute logarithms.

We should instead call PARI's `fflog()`, which uses an index-calculus algorithm and is dramatically faster in some cases.

The code looks good to me.
However, I find it odd the comment

```
Big instances used to take very long before :trac:`32842`::
```

in the examples block quite odd.

Travis, what do you think?

The example, as I usually only see trac tickets mentioned under tests referring to a bug that has been fixed.
This is only a minor thing, and if you think it's alright, we can give it a positive review.
