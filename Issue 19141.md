# Issue 19141: mod 2, product of nx0 matrix and 0-dimensional vector: segfault

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19378

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2015-10-08 23:20:42


```
sage: matrix(GF(2), 11, 0) * vector(GF(2), 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault: 11
```

This has to do with the dense `GF(2)` matrices:

```
sage: matrix(GF(2), 11, 0, sparse=True) * vector(GF(2), 0)
(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
```

Here is a fix which just skips the multiplication of a vector times matrix since the result will be 0.
