# Issue 16546: fix simplex in polytopes doc

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16783

Original creator: moritz

Original creation time: 2014-08-08 11:52:22

for some reason it read "cross-polytopes" where it should read "simplex" in the doc of the polytope library. See patch, where it is corrected.

Sorry, but what is the problem ? The former branch name was `u/moritz/doc/polytopes`

The "Branch" field must be the branch name, not commit sha1
