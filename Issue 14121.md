# Issue 14121: Lazy p-adics

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14325

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2013-03-21 04:14:26

Assignee: roed

Long ago, Sage had lazy `p`-adics (the remnants are still in the code).  It would be nice for this feature to be revived.

Do we still want to have this feature included in Sage?

One option would be to write an interface between Sage and Mathemagix. How does it sound?

I think this ticket can be closed.  An interface with Mathemagix would be cool, though it sounds like a lot of work.

OK for closing the ticket. How should we do it?

Presuming these are all correctly reviewed as either duplicate, invalid, or wontfix.
