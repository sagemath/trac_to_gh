# Issue 5951: [with patch, needs review] fix a few minor issues with the reference manual in 3.4.2.rc0

The file latex.py causes some warnings to pop up when building the reference manual (because of my patch at #5791).  This fixes them.  It also adds the file latex_macros.py to the reference manual.
