Hello Quentin,

You need to start a **new** branch for this ticket. Here you started from the same as for #18439.

Some more comments:

1. you should break the lines in your comments. The line `The construction of a Hughes plane is based on a nearfield ...` is one kilometer long. Try to keep the width around 80.

2. you should align the comments `# xyz` with the code

3. It would be cool to have some code in the `EXAMPLES` section which proves that Hughes plane are indeed different from the standard finite projective plane. You can show that the theorem of Desargues is not satisfied.

4. For the function `normalize` it would be better to say that it is only intended to be used in `HughesPlane`. And you can even call it `normalize_hughes_plane_point`, in other words choose something more explicit.

5. In the function `HughesPlane`, it would be nice to add few words explaining the construction and also add references (for example to Hughes original article and also Dembowski 1971)

Instead of calling 'is_projective_plane' in the constructor of desarguesian projective planes, could you make it return a BIBD instead of a Block Design? This way, the constructor would automatically check the property.

Thanks,

Hello Quentin,

There is a lot of work to do in the documentation. Most of it is uncomprehensible. Hopefully I know what you are trying to do but any other person will not get a word. I already modified some of it in my commit at `public/18527` but there are still a lot of things to do:
- In `HughesPlane` the following sentence is uncomprehensible

```
    For p an odd prime.
    If kernel K of order `p^n` coincides with the center of a nearfield N.
    The construction of a Hughes plane is based on N of order `p^2n`.
```

   you should explain **simply** what is the Hughes plane. If it is complicated just make a reference to wikipedia and just explain what it is (e.g. The Hughes plane is a finite projective plane introduced by XYZ and which is not Desarguesian)

- If you want to include mathematics formula in the documentation you must use the block `MATH`. This is described in details in [the developer's guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)

- the example that shows that the Hughes plane is not Desarguesian is not finished... And you should explain what you are doing with sentences (not Python comments starting with `#`). I already modified and simplified the begining.

Hello,

When you are done with your changes, you need to set back to `needs review`. That way I know that I need to have a look.

Some more comments:

- with your last commit the test do not pass
- put spaces around equality signs `a = b` and not `a=b`. Similarly, add spaces in function declaration `f(a, b)` and not `f(a,b)`.
- When you define the Hughes plane you start with `p` being an odd prime but it is never used
- for coherence of notations, instead of using `n2` and `n` it would be better to use `q2` and `q` (and do not forget to modify the `INPUT` section)

I did a bit of profiling and it appears that most of the time is spent in doing matrix by vector multiplication! I will try to see whether it is possible to improve that part (in another ticket).

```

In my review commits I changed few things (removed `random` from `random_q3_minus_one_matrix`, make `HughesPlane` works for non prime `q` and improve a bit the code).

There are still some issues with the documentation. Please pay more attention to what you write.

You wrote

```
Return the Hughes projective plane of order `n2`.
```

But the name of the parameter is now `q2`. Moreover you must use double quotes for the parameters ```q2````. Simple ones are for latex code.

This is not a sentence

```
For q an odd prime.
```


When you test the fact that it is not Desarguesian, it is weird to do it in two ways. Here you print the name of the points

```
        sage: set(b_0_1).intersection(b_57_70)
        {2}
        sage: set(b_1_10).intersection(b_70_59)
        {73}
        sage: set(b_10_0).intersection(b_59_57)
        {60}
```

But then you just test equality

```
        sage: p = set(b_0_57).intersection(b_1_70)
        sage: q = set(b_1_70).intersection(b_10_59)
        sage: p == q
        False
```

You should do it coherently.

You can also add a section `AUTHORS` with your name in the function `HughesPlane` (see the developer guide).

Oups. I understood... you are not testing the same thing! Sorry. Forget about this specific comment.

When you add some stuff pay attention to the fact that you do not add trailing whitespaces (i.e. spaces at the end of the lines).

I added a small commit which move around some stuff and simplify the documentation.

There is one more thing to do: the new function `HughesPlane` does not appear in the list of the functions available in the top of the file `design_catalog.py`. You can put the reference just after `DesarguesianProjectivePlaneDesign`.
