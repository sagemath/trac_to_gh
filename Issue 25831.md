I'm not sure about the following:  FriCAS computes a real limit and returns a pair if the right hand limit and the left hand limit do not coincide.  For example, from #14677:

```
sage: f = (x^x-sin(x)^sin(x))/(x^3*log(x))
sage: fricas(f).limit(x=0)
                                            1
[leftHandLimit = "failed", rightHandLimit = -]
                                            6
```


What should sage return in this case?  Should it be `und`, or can we do better?
