I don't understand the default behavior of `to_word`. Why isn't it just what gives you `Tietze`

```
sage: F = FreeGroup(3,'x')
sage: x0,x1,x2 = F.gens()
sage: w = x0*x1^-2*x2^2*x0^-1
sage: Word(w.Tietze())
word: 1,-2,-2,3,3,-1
```

I concur that "to_word" is slightly controversial. The rest is fine.

This is no longer compatible with the current code in sage => needs work status
