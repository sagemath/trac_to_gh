# Issue 29121: Orientation suffix

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29358

Original creator: @Shlokatadistance

Adding the orientation suffix when using the
 {{{
add_path
}}}
 functionality, instead of Sage returning random paths each time the code is executed

Also, adding something like a closed() suffix to create a closed directed graph is useful.

unless the reporter wants to clarify the proposal and to propose some code, I think we should move this ticket to wontfix.
