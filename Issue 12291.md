# Issue 12291: Polyehdron intersection and equality inconsistencies

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12463

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2012-02-07 15:30:31

Assignee: mhampton

CC:  vbraun

Keywords: polyhedron, equality, intersection

First of all, polyhedron __eq__ documentation is wrong. It states

"""
    def __eq__(self, other):
        """
        Test whether ``self`` is a strict sub-polyhedron of ``other``.
"""

This does not correspond with the actual code nor the test.

Morevover, intersection of polyhedra produces output with wrong internal representation.


```
sage: P=Polyhedron([[0,0]], rays=[[1,1]])
sage: Q1=Polyhedron([[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: Q2=Polyhedron([[1,0],[0,1]])
sage: Q=Q1.intersection(Q2)
sage: Q==P
True
sage: Q < P
False
```

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Attachment

It seems that now inequality/containment are checked correctly, but the documentation of `__eq__` still has a typo.

Changing keywords from "polyhedron, equality, intersection" to "polyhedron, equality, intersection, sd40.5".

Does not seem to be necessary with #11763 where only cmp is left.

This is fixed in #11763. Resolve as duplicate.

This should be rebased to #13638.

Close ticket as duplicate, see comment:4. Does not need rebasing ;-)

Then you should put the milestone to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix. Never expect the release manager to read the ticket comments.
