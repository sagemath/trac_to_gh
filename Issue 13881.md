The updated patch fixes two minor doctests failures I had missed and that the patchbot reported. I assume that the third failure in interface/expect.py is unrelated.

Cheers,

New version with quite a few improvements. Unless I missed something, I consider this patch as final. Please review!

Anne reviewed this patch on the Sage-Combinat queue. The updated patch includes her changes which were cross checked by Nicolas. We also discussed further the math with Mark Shimozono.

Positive review!
                               Anne and Nicolas
