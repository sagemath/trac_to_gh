And rename them to *.dll, or rather make sure they are directly compiled to *.dll files, otherwise youre asking for trouble (kind of DT_SONAME or things like that will confuse the runtime linker).

is this really worth the trouble? E.g. cygwin packages have some .so files...

At least within the standard packages there are no longer any .so files.  There might be some still in some optional packages that do this-or-that incorrectly w.r.t. Cygwin, but those can be updated on a case-by-case basis as we encounter them, if any.
