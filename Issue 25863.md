This solution is essentially what I meant in #25309. I just don't like that it silently fails if I explicitly provides `MAXIMA_FAS`. I'd prefer it if ECLDIR would just default to `None` in `env.py` and the default is only used when it is `None` (not explicitly overwritten).

In fact, `... is not None` is the appropriate test if `None` is used as a sentinel value. The empty string `""` would also be "False", and I imagine you might want to treat it differently from the value not being present. There are some wilder scenarios where it matters, e.g. if someone makes a string type that always tests `False`, but that is pretty exotic.

From ecl's configure script:

AC_ARG_VAR([ecldir], [the directory where *.fas files are installed])
test -z "${ecldir}" && ecldir="${libdir}/ecl-${PACKAGE_VERSION}"

Sage works fine without a system ecl and without setting ECLDIR (even after removing it from sage-env). From #7186 setting it was added to fix issues after moving the sage tree - I wonder if that still makes sense now that moving the tree is no longer supported
