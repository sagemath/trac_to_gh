Keywords: magma

These doctests currently fail:


```
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/matrix/benchmark.py
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/rings/integer_ring.pyx 
```

Changing status from new to needs_info.

All doctest failures fixed except for 


```
sage -t --long --optional sage,magma /bulk/home/malb/software/sage/src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py
```


where I'm not immediately sure what to do.

These were the ones failing for me on bsd.math with *vanilla* Sage 6.2 (and `--long --optional=magma,sage --all`, Magma V2.18-6):

P.S.:  Sorry, I only later noticed the purpose of #16282 was _not_ to fix all Magma doctests; I somehow completely misread the ticket and/or your post to sage-devel (presumably due to the Gmane outage ;-) )...

these are all resolved except for the Galois group thing mentioned above (I fixed one more issue where newer versions of Magma report errors slightly different from older versions)

anyone up for reviewing tis?

Maybe you want to set the ticket to "needs review" first? Is it?

Resolution: fixed
