My ticket was not ready, I'm not even sure it still works as it was done a while ago. It was based on the implementation of binary trees, basically doing the same thing with some extra stuff.

Are some of you going to be in Canada? Or at FPSAC? I believe this could be wrapped up or at least in  a very good shape in one day.

(See Frédéric, we do care, but Adrien is right, we just have no time...)
