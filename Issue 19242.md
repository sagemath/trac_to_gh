Hello, Adrien and Bérénice !

Have you looked at #13987 ? Modulo k=m, maybe you could join efforts with Viviane (if she is still interested) ?

I just want to see if Florent or Viviane have any quick thoughts/opinions about the two implementations, to see what we might want to combine between the two branches.

As you can see, not so many people feel concerned by your question, Travis. Let us close this one, please.

We fell concerned, but we have no time. It is not the same thing !

In this ticket we need to write the documentation and the doctest to finish him.
Perhaps, the ticket of Viviane is ready.

My ticket was not ready, I'm not even sure it still works as it was done a while ago. It was based on the implementation of binary trees, basically doing the same thing with some extra stuff.

Are some of you going to be in Canada? Or at FPSAC? I believe this could be wrapped up or at least in  a very good shape in one day.

(See Frédéric, we do care, but Adrien is right, we just have no time...)

ok, ok.

The point is that I already worked and made Viviane's ticket #13987 fully ready (at least on a formal level, namely full doctests and all tests pass, green bot). This one is much less ready, and I would prefer if the work concentrate on the other one, given our available time.

Four years later, I propose again to close this as duplicate of #13987.

But nobody is listening.
