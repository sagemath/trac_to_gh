CC:  jdemeyer slelievre

With 8.3.rc1:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 - x^5 - 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 3*x - 1)
sage: K.ideal(1,1)
```

takes a long time to return -- why?  Using %time it immediately shows 1ms for the second line but the prompt does not appear until *minutes* later.

Since the field discriminant is less than `10^6` the string function calls gens_reduced, and that is taking the time.  Specifially the call to self_cache_bnfisprincipal() is.  This suggests that something needs fixing;  but also it might be a good idea to include special case code for the unit ideal -- this ideal has norm 1 which is trivial to compute so returning the string '(1)' could be done as a short cut.

That's such a special case, I'm not convinced that it's worth it.

Indeed. So I would say that this heuristic bound of the discriminant is not sufficient to predict that the class group is easy to compute.

```

There is something strange here.  Nothing to do with the representation if ideals really.  For this field, if you construct its pari_bnf, it takes ages to return even with no output:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 - x^5 - 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 3*x - 1)                                                                                 
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                    
CPU times: user 1min 11s, sys: 128 ms, total: 1min 11s
Wall time: 1min 11s
```

but in a fresh Sage session, if I interrupt the second line immediately and then rerun it:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^6 - x^5 - 5*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 6*x^2 - 3*x - 1)                                                                                 
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                
<interrupt after <1s>
sage: %time pK = K.pari_bnf(proof=False, units=False)                                                                                                  
CPU times: user 36 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 36 ms
Wall time: 37.2 ms
```


Also, after this, displaying K.ideal(1,1) is instantaneous.  So I think that there *is* a bug in here, though I cannot tell what is happening.

Simplifying further:

```
sage: y = polygen(QQ, 'y')                                                                                                                             
sage: f = pari(y^6 - y^5 - 5*y^4 + 4*y^3 + 6*y^2 - 3*y - 1)                                                                                            
sage: %time f.bnfinit() 
CPU times: user 1min 9s, sys: 144 ms, total: 1min 9s
Wall time: 1min 9s
```

while again, interrupting immediately and reissuing the last line gives the output immediately.

Lastly, 

```
sage: %gp                                                                                                                                              

  --> Switching to PARI/GP interpreter <--

pari: K = bnfinit(y^6 - y^5 - 5*y^4 + 4*y^3 + 6*y^2 - 3*y - 1);                                                                                        

pari: ##                                                                                                                                               
  ***   last result computed in 24 ms.
