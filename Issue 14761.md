Implementation for wrapping GAP's `SemidirectProduct` function for finitely presented groups


```
sage: C2 = groups.presentation.Cyclic(2)
sage: C8 = groups.presentation.Cyclic(8)
sage: hom = (C2.gens(), [ ([C8([1])], [C8([-1])]) ])
sage: D = C2.semidirect_product(C8, hom)
sage: D.as_permutation_group().is_isomorphic(DihedralGroup(8))
True
```


Depends on #14791 for `groups.presentation.Cyclic(12)` functionality in doctests, and #14913
for computations using finitely presented groups.

The patch on this ticket uncovers a bug in GAP's automorphism group capabilities. Will report soon but currently I do not have an account for GAP's tracker.

Hey,

Here's a review patch which does some formatting fixes. If you're happy with my changes, you can set this to positive review.

Best,

Review patch looks great, thanks for taking the time to make some of my examples more clear, on top of the formatting fixes.
