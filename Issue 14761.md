Implementation for wrapping GAP's `SemidirectProduct` function for finitely presented groups


```
sage: C2 = groups.presentation.Cyclic(2)
sage: C8 = groups.presentation.Cyclic(8)
sage: hom = (C2.gens(), [ ([C8([1])], [C8([-1])]) ])
sage: D = C2.semidirect_product(C8, hom)
sage: D.as_permutation_group().is_isomorphic(DihedralGroup(8))
True
```


Depends on #14791 for `groups.presentation.Cyclic(12)` functionality in doctests, and #14913
for computations using finitely presented groups.
