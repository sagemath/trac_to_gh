Keywords: laurent series, truncate

There is the following difference in behaviour between truncate() for power series and laurent series:

sage: P.<p> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: L.<l> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: f = p^2 + p^3 + p^5 +p^6 + O(p^7)
sage: g = l^2 + l^3 + l^5 +l^6 + O(l^7)
sage: f.truncate(6)
p^5 + p^3 + p^2
sage: g.truncate(6)
l^2 + l^3 + l^5 + O(l^6)
sage: f.truncate_powerseries(6)
p^2 + p^3 + p^5 + O(p^6)

The problem is simply that g.truncate() calls truncate_powerseries() on its underlying power series.

The attached patch changes LaurentSeries.truncate() such that is calls truncate() on the underlying powerseries. For the current behaviour, it also adds a method truncate_laurentseries() which calls truncate_powerseries() on the underlying powerseries.

In my opinion, the methods truncate_powerseries and truncate_laurentseries are superfluous since they are equivalent to add_bigoh().

Looks good, positive review.  Doesn't break any doctests in rings because Laurent series are so poorly tested!
Only bad thing is that you should include the ticket number on the patch, i.e. this one should have been named something like trac_10272_laurent_series_truncate.patch.  This helps the release manager and others in a variety of ways.
