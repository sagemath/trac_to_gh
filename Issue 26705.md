# Issue 26705: Python is missing from dependencies in installation instructions

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2018-12-22 16:45:08

Just tried out WSL which doesn't install python by default, should be added to  https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#linux-prerequisite-installation

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
