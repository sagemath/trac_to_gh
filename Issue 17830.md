Keywords: graphs, sage-combinat,

The idea seems to be that the `__init__` method of `Graph` should check if the user provides some edges more than 1 time, and, if so, return a multigraph instead of a graph. In reality, whether this happens depends on the order of vertices the user provides:

```
sage: Graph([[1,2],[1,2]])
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
sage: Graph([[1,2],[2,1]])
Graph on 2 vertices
```

Apparently, it is the `if len(set(data[u])) != len(data[u])` conditional on line 1497 of graph.py which fails to fire in the second example.

Hello !

I was actually thinking of this very behaviour last week, as many things in the (di)Graph constructors should be rewritten. A lot of time is also wasted because we have to detect what the user 'intends' to build, and at some point I thought that this could be solved by asking the user to tell us explicitly whether (s)he wants a simple graph or a multigraph, using the `multiedges=True` flag. Nowadays, I am not so sure anymore.

In this specific case, I also believe that, as you advise, we should return a multigraph. But to understand better what it works this way, see how it works for dictionary input (note that 'list of edges' input is converted into dictionary input):

```
sage: Graph({1:[2],2:[1]}).edges()
[(1, 2, None)]
```

What do you think the user wants in this case ? Is (s)he giving us a multigraph, or merely giving the adjacencies between the vertices in both directions?

Right now, giving the adjacencies in both direction or giving them only once yields the same result

```
sage: Graph({1:[2],2:[1]}) == Graph({1:[2]})
True
```

And of course, saying twice that 2 is a neighbor of 1 yields a multigraph

```
sage: Graph({1:[2,2]})
Multi-graph on 2 vertices
```

I will fix this bug soon, by making `Graph(list_of_edges)` call `add_edge` immediately. The code will also be shorter. But the graph constructors will have to be rewritten, and standards will change. We cannot guess the user's intent without guessing wrong at times, and we want to avoid that.

Don't worry, I will write some code for that very soon. I am about to leave to Liege (Belgium) for some Sage days so I will not be able to do it this week-end most probably (I'll be backpacking) but it will definitely be done during the week.

I would also like to turn this huge `__init__` into independent functions, but that is not totally straightforward either. I do want to make it shorter, though.

I agree with you. But I already wrote something to make those argument mandatory, and noticed that it broke doctests.. Because a complete graph stored as a multigraph is not (for Sage) equal to a complete graph (stored as a simple graph) and other problems like that.

Well. 1) I will fix this in the next days and 2) I am aware that this code has to be changed, and I will do something about it. Especially since David Coudert would like to be able to load huge graphs in Sage, and that it is currently impossible.

Hello,

Well, this code really needs to be rewritten properly.

> is so ugly it is almost ridiculous.

+1

> Good job improving the if-condition, but IMHO the whole logic should go to hell.


Ahahaha. Well, I also agree with you on that point, but I cannot get code in Sage by myself. I know that I only fixed a small part of the problem in this ticket, but doing too many things at once makes it impossible to find a reviewer. Soooooo while I already know what the next ticket will be about, I thought that it was better to write a smaller patch first. Then the other will come.

I do not believe in adding doctests to explain that our code is bad. Let us change the code.
