Remind me, why are you pulling `SAGE_ETC` from `sage.misc.misc` rather than `sage.env`? In fact I would like to know if this file is needed at all.

It just write one useful line for `qepcadrc`

```
SINGULAR $expanded_path_to_SAGE_LOCAL/bin
```
If this is the path to singular, unless it is hardcoded to a location by default, it is in the path and therefore not very useful.

Let me see if I understand: this was in `sage-location` because it needed to hardcode the value of `SAGE_LOCAL` in `default.qepcadrc`, so if that location changed, `default.qepcadrc` needed to be rewritten. Is that right? If so, it makes sense to move it to the `spkg-install.in` script.
