This is split out from #15105.

QEPCAD assumes unusual locations for several files, including 
 - `$SAGE_LOCAL/default.qepcadrc` (which would better live in `$SAGE_ETC` (= `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc`)
 - `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/qepcad.help` (which would better live in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/qepcad`)

The patch (split out from #15105) tried to makes a change regarding the location on the Sage side of things; but QEPCAD itself also would need changing.

That's a bigger project; lots of things about QEPCAD need changing (build system, memory management, ...)

Remind me, why are you pulling `SAGE_ETC` from `sage.misc.misc` rather than `sage.env`? In fact I would like to know if this file is needed at all.

It just write one useful line for `qepcadrc`

```
SINGULAR $expanded_path_to_SAGE_LOCAL/bin
```

If this is the path to singular, unless it is hardcoded to a location by default, it is in the path and therefore not very useful.

Let me see if I understand: this was in `sage-location` because it needed to hardcode the value of `SAGE_LOCAL` in `default.qepcadrc`, so if that location changed, `default.qepcadrc` needed to be rewritten. Is that right? If so, it makes sense to move it to the `spkg-install.in` script.

Yes, that's right.

And to clarify, you're not changing the odd locations mentioned in the description. Is it worth modifying the description? The changes look good to me.
