The changes look good.

In `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/conway_polynomials.py`,
lines 514 to 521, the patchbot complains about `path`
being used without having been defined.

Should it be `levelling_path` instead?
Can pbruin who authored these lines comment?

I have no idea; I only moved this code between files.  Maybe David Roe or Jean-Pierre Flori (CC) can say more?

Yes, it should be `levelling_path` instead.  Though obviously this code path is not getting reached at the moment.
