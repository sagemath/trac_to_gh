This patch implements testing for isomorphism (equivalence up to `GL(n,ZZ)` rotation) of fans

```
  sage: m1 = matrix([(1, 0), (0, -5), (-3, 4)])
  sage: m2 = matrix([(3, 0), (1, 0), (-2, 1)])
  sage: m1.elementary_divisors() == m2.elementary_divisors() == [1,1,0]
  True
  sage: fan1 = Fan([Cone([m1*vector([23, 14]), m1*vector([   3,100])]), 
  ...               Cone([m1*vector([-1,-14]), m1*vector([-100, -5])])])
  sage: fan2 = Fan([Cone([m2*vector([23, 14]), m2*vector([   3,100])]), 
  ...               Cone([m2*vector([-1,-14]), m2*vector([-100, -5])])])
  sage: fan1.is_isomorphic(fan2)
  True
  sage: fan1.isomorphism(fan2)
  Fan morphism defined by the matrix
  [18  1 -5]
  [ 4  0 -1]
  [ 5  0 -1]
  Domain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
  Codomain fan: Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```

This is implemented by first computing the isomorphisms of auxiliary labelled graphs, and then trying to lift those to actual fan morphisms.

Computing the graph automorphism group goes through GAP, which is slow. The updated patch uses a special version of the isomorphism check for 2-d fans which avoids this.

There is very nice code to compute one particular graph isomorphism, but I want to iterate over all graph isomorphisms. I'm doing this by combining the chose iso with the automorphisms of one of the graphs. But enumerating the automorphism group is using GAP, presumably you can gain more through group theory than what you can gain by making the graph theory fast.

Glanced through, spotted a few typos that I'll fix in the reviewer patch.

What do you mean by the following change of output description??

```
By default, ``True`` if ``self`` and ``other`` are in the same
`GL(n, \ZZ)`-orbit, ``False`` otherwise.
```


Do you mind if I also switch computation of the virtual rays to the fan constructor and allow user to specify them? It is convenient e.g. when considering an affine toric variety corresponding to a face of another cone, or a subfanfan with similar structure. Then coordinates on the smaller variety can match the bigger ones.

The new module also has to be included into documentation, I think. Is there actually a particular reason why it is not just in `fan.py`?

I'm trying to say that it returns whether the two fans are equivalent up to a `GL(n,ZZ)` basis change. Apparently not comprehensible enough ;-)

If you want to implement that, go for it.

OK, positive review to Volker's patches modulo reviewer's one, which needs review now.

Changes:
* move `virtual_rays` method to fans only and allow specifying them during fan construction;
* allow addition of point collections, which results in some simplification of code and examples;
* a bunch of clarification/typo fixes in the documentation.

Also, am I right that with automatically chosen virtual rays the choice cannot affect the isomorphism of cones?

I forgot the commit message in trac_13189_cone_isomorphism.patch, no actual code changes.

The reviewer patch looks good to me.

The virtual ray choice doesn't change whether or not there is a isomorphism of two cones / two fans (barring any bugs), but the matrix entries of the lattice map of course differ.
