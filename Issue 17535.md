# Issue 17535: Sublinking of static_dense_graph

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: gouezel

Original creation time: 2015-02-12 17:34:16

Since #17665, `static_dense_graph.pyx` includes `bitset.pxi` and should therefore be linked against `gmp`. This is not apparent on linux, but shows up on cygwin which is more picky on linking.
