Hello,

Your branch does not apply anymore. It might be related to the recent changes introduced by David and Johan that are now in copy.

Hi Vincent,

someone started to make the current huffman also compatible with Python 3. I did now at least the same changes, but it is also not completely compatible by now.

Quick question: Is it necessary to merge the branch with the current version of Sage (for the automerging to succeed)?

Quick answer: yes.

If you modify a file that is also modified by some commits in the current beta then there are some merge conflict.

I think I've fixed the merge conflicts. I also performed some python 3 fixes for `print` and  relative imports. This should now hopefully be as ready for review as the previous commit was.

I might go ahead and clean this up a bit more, and incorporate #26026 into it.

the branch is red, this does not make sense to switch to positive review

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
