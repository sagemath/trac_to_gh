The attached patch adds to the Sage testsuite most examples appearing Chapters 6 and 8 (Polynomials, Polynomial Systems) of the French book [Calcul mathématique avec Sage](http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/). See #9395 for some background.

All tests pass with sage 4.7.

Martin, please could you review this? This will help our book to be more stable with future
versions of Sage. Thank you in advance (as a coauthor of the book, I'm quite reluctant to
review this).

Sure, I can take a look:

* Please rename the patch to have the ".patch" suffix.
* There might be an issue with the UTF-8, but we should try and wait if anybody complaints.
* Do you really want to include an autogenerated file without any manual post processing? ("This file was *autogenerated* from sagebook.tex with sagetex.sty")
* Please add your full name to the author field here on Trac.
* I get some numerical noise errors:

```python

I wonder why we get different results for `x`. If all computations are based on IEEE 754, we should get the same (wrong) value. Is it possible to know which components of Sage are used for `J.variety(RDF)` on each platform? On mine I get:

```
sage: get_systems('J.variety(RDF)')                          
['MPFI', 'Singular', 'numpy', 'ginac']
```

Since MPFI is based on MPFR, MPFI should be architecture independent, but I wonder if the same applies to Singular, numpy and ginac...

Anyway, this test doesn't make much sense, I shouldn't have included this test in the first place. Here is a new version of the patch without that test. I took the opportunity to ignore the last few significant digits in another numerical result that might change a bit in the future.

yes, or with a different rounding precision. Anyway, it might be worth tracking down this issue. Jeroen, is there a way to trace the calls to the different Sage components (MPFI, Singular, numpy, ginac)?

Well, the test obviously indicate that there is a problem somewhere, and I tend to believe that we should keep the test and track the problem.

Either your computation is ill-conditioned, and the test should be removed from Sage (and probably also from the book), or there is a component of sage that misbehaves. We should understand what the situation is, and act accordingly. These tests have been there for 1.5 years, so we are not in a hurry.  Maybe we could compare intermediate results on different machines?
