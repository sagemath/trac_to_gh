Helloooooooooo !!!

It would be cool to have an explicit error message when there is no output due to this 10ms thing. Could you also add this new file to the reference manual ?

By the way, what it this `:param s:/:type s:` ? I never saw them before. Could you wrap that in a "INPUT" block btw (the two crun functions need one) ?

Also : the gif output is cool but would there  be a way to make it available through %crun directly ? Or at least crun("cmd") ?

There is also an unfinished sentence in the doc :


```
By default, a if 
```
