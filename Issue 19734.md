There is an effort under way to implement SCSCP interface for python at https://github.com/OpenMath/py-scscp This seems to be making progress. This should be a good basis.

A pip-installable package is available here: https://github.com/OpenMath/py-scscp.

It contains a command-line synchronous client, base classes to implement a server, and a (pure-python) demo server exposing a very limited content dictionary.

At this point, client support for SCSCP can be considered done for Sage (modulo bugs). We may have to decide whether to make an spkg or not, but `sage -pip scscp` is probably good enough.

True server support requires #19970, and this is a long way coming.
