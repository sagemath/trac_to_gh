Some `configure` scripts are buggy when they are run with shells other than `bash`. See #23451 for example. Since Sage requires `bash` anyway, we can easily work around this by forcing `bash` to run `configure`.

Are there any other packages with non-portable configure scripts, other than the two mentioned in #23451? I think I was able to build all of sage using dash 0.5.9 with only those two "fixed".

Using `/bin/sh` when possible is a way to give extra testing to configure scripts, which are meant to ensure portability of software. Sage packages some mathematical software that is not included in distros, so they won't get exposure to diverse environments otherwise.

Also, a script that works with several different shells is a script that is less likely to break when bash changes, or with older versions of bash, etc.

----

Anyway, maybe it is a good idea to do

```
if [ -z "$CONFIG_SHELL" ]; then
    export CONFIG_SHELL="$SHELL"
fi
```

to allow overriding of `$CONFIG_SHELL` ?

I don't know what you exactly mean.
Just check the 1st line of the top `./configure`. There is no `bash` there.

But this does not guarantee that `sdh_configure` is only launched from there.
Someone could source the `sdh_configure` in a non-bash session and shoot themselves in the foot...

On some systems, `/bin/sh` is `bash`:

```
jdemeyer@sage4:~$ /bin/sh --version
GNU bash, version 4.3.48(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)

Given that `bash` is meant to be POSIX-compliant, it should not be a problem to force the use of `bash`.

I disagree completely with this point. It's not the goal of Sage to use our users for testing the portability of configure scripts.

We should ensure that Sage can be installed on as many systems as possible. I claim that using `bash` for configure scripts is more portable than using `/bin/sh`. So that is what we should do.

Related question I've been wondering about for a while (while we're discussing it here): Do we require GNU make for Sage, or should any POSIX-compatible make work?  I would very much like to make use of GNU-specific features (e.g. #21524) and I'm not 100% sure if all of Sage's packages will work with a generic make but it's never been clear to me if that's a requirement or not.

Been there, done that, got the T-shirt. Proof is in the pudding, someone should do a complete build. My experience is that a libtool component will break sooner rather than later.

GNU make is needed. Once upon a time (in 2008) me and a debian developper at the time tried to patch packages to be able to use other `make`. We did go exactly nowhere. Fully autotooled packages are probably OK, it is all the custom ones that are troublesome - and it is so easy to use GNUism in make because they are so useful...

Good, I'm glad.  While this is a problem autotools is supposed to solve that's not a universal solution anyways.
