* Typo in:

```
+.. [ILZ2018] \K. Iohara, G. Gehrer, and R. Zhang.
```

second author should be G. Lehrer

* unicode art ? (ok, not really needed...)

Fixed for the first. As for the second, it took some work, but I implemented an ascii/unicode art and it looks beautiful IMO. Now the question becomes will someone figure out a better way to do it or to generalize it in some way to general partition diagrams. Anyways, it works for now.

patchbot plugin is not happy with invalid espace sequences, some missing `r"""` ?

Indeed I was missing a necessary one on `TL_diagram_ascii_art()`. Fixed.

ok, looks good. But I suspect that the bullet ⚫ will break the unicode display alignment in many fonts. Maybe the letter "capital O" would do a better job, even if not as nice.

Much better !

Say hello to the

```
   __         __

Okay, I have tried to fix the pdf docbuild. At least, this is the only thing that I could see that would break it. I will try to test it later today.

unicode may be another source of latex issues, alas

Well, if that is indeed the problem, we can just remove that output (well, the ones with the blobs on them).

So it was that in part, and because I forgot to add the blob algebra to the BLOC (big list of combinatorics) modules. The html and pdf docs now builds for me.

ok, looks good. Let us try again

Looking at https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.2#Unicode_art,
unfortunately the "⚬" does not align well with the line art when viewed in the Chrome browser on macOS (it's fine, of course, in Emacs and in the terminal)

Same for me using Firefox on Ubuntu, but it might just be something we have to live with.
