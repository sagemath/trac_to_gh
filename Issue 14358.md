Wow.
This patch is scary.
Really scary.
The construction is awful, and there's not much that I could do to make the code clear.
The point is that I do not understand the construction myself, and I did not try either, I just wanted to implement it. And it already took Quiiiiiiiiiiiiiite a lot of times, and headaches `:-)`

This patch implements a method that returns a Steiner Quadruple System whenever it exists. It follows the construction from Haim Hanani in a paper from 1960, which gives 6 differents constructions to make a large system from a small one, and all must be used to solve all cases.

Considering that I was able to test this code until `n =`, and that all constructions have been tested for different values of `n`, I believe that this code is a correct counterpart of the paper itself. That's what makes me think that there is no typo in the code anymore (I fixed one thousand of them while writing it). So, even if it is very, very scary and unclear, I think that it is correct...

Hi Nathann,

concerning typos, i think that the new doctest trick

```
....: 
```

was created to correctly align the indentations. Hence, it could be better to add 4 spaces in your examples, instead of 3.

Oh ? Well, I added four. But I don't get why : I think that the purpose was to align the length of this with the length of "sage:". So I thought that the number of spaces put use in front of an "if" is irrelevant `O_o`

> Meuuuuuuuuuh non t'es pas tout seul a chialer dans ta chambre.


D'aileurs j'ai pas de chambre.
Et en plus je suis pas seul parce que dans ma coloc y'avait un annif hier soir, et qu'il y avait tranquille 10 personnes qui campaient cte nuit. Dont deux dans ma chambre.
Des gens bien `:-D`

The point is that while I was writing this patch I had a loop trying to build all SQS from 4 to 100, and it was slightly faster when cached. If you think that it is useless here I will remove it. I don't mind much `:-)`

Hello!

Don't ask how I came to this ticket.

I have a question. Is there a reason you use

```
 for i in range(n) 
```

instead of 

```
for i in xrange(n)
```

?

Best,

J
