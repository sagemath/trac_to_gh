This patch implements 
* the prime spectrum for affine toric varieties. 
* patches for algebraic schemes with singular ambient toric varieties

This uses both the Hilbert basis for cones and the algebraic schemes, and, therefore, depends on
* #10525: move algebraic subschemes of toric varieties to their rightful places
* #10529: dimension() and is_smooth() for algebraic subschemes of toric varieties
* #9918: triangulate point configurations
* #10023: Compute Hilbert basis of cone

Comments/questions on the first patch (toric ideals):
1. The default names of variables are not described in the class constructor.
2. Perhaps, as an alternative to specifying names, it should be possible to specify the ring in which the ideal has to be constructed?
3. Out of curiosity: are there any reasons for using `QQ` as the default ring and not `ZZ`?

Looks good!

For the second patch:
5. (line 433) The implementation looks very confusing to me: why would you store in the field `embedding_morphism` an exception??? I would expect either returning the stored value if it exists, or constructing the default embedding into the ambient space...
1. (line 441) Am I right that `embedding_origin` may be a non-origin as in not (0,0,0)? In this case I kind of really don't like using the word `origin`, how about `marked_point` instead or `embegging_marking` or `embedding_center` to put it next to the embedding?
2. (line 1847) There should be no "local", this scheme is just isomorphic to a neighbourhood of the point.
3. (line 1859) ```result.embedding_morphism``` should be more like `:meth:`embedding_morphism`` or at least ```result.embedding_morphism()```, same for (1862).
4. (line 2076) `affine_patch` was used for compatibility with projective spaces, do we really need to change its name? If yes, then a) the old name should be kept as well for compatibility, b) how about `covering_patch` since toric varieties are printed as `covered by 5 affine patches`?
5. "algebraic" attached to patches seems a bit weird to me...
6. Aha, now I see that `affine_patch` is preserved. Now the question is - do we really need three functions or maybe `affine_patch` with several forms of input will do?..
7. (line 2169) Why 0 is listed as one of the ideal generators?

Also, it seems that with `-long` option the long test is really long both on my machine and on sage.math, although I didn't try any other version of Sage but 4.7.1.alpha2. Applying Hilbert cone speed up does not seem to help.

Andrey reported a performance regression in Sage-4.7.1.alpha2 for the long doctests. The reason is that the syntax for computing the LLL-reduced kernel changed from `A.right_kernel(LLL=True)` to `A.right_kernel(basis='LLL')`. Unfortunately #10746 did not add a deprecation warning, but then we were the only users of the `LLL=True` syntax. The result was that Sage-4.7.1.alpha2 computed the naive ideal with the echelon form of the kernel and not the LLL-reduced form, which makes the Groebner basis computations much much harder.

The updated patch switches to the new syntax and works as fast as before.
