A minor comment: I believe that 

```
We check that #11403 has been resolved:
```

should read

```
We check that :trac:`11403` has been resolved::
```

(at least someone once told me that I should use the `:trac:` syntax.)

For everything else, I'm waiting for the results of my doctests.

Two minor issues with the patch files:

* [This is the Trac macro *attachment:11403_sig.patch* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#attachment:11403_sig.patch-macro) does not mention the ticket number. 
* [This is the Trac macro *attachment:11403_fix.patch* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#attachment:11403_fix.patch-macro): I believe it should read `Trac 11403:` instead of `#11403` which is understood as a comment (?).
