(from #31538)

`ubuntu-focal-i386-standard` consistently fails - lots of missing packages (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/2170889217).
"Upgrades on i386: Users of the i386 architecture will not be presented with an upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Support for i386 as a host architecture was dropped in 19.10." (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes)

We replace it by [https://github.com/pypa/manylinux manylinux_2_24](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux manylinux_2_24) (which is based on `debian-stretch`).
