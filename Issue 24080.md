# Issue 24080: Improve conversion of inexact symbolic values

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-12-03 15:26:47

Because there is no conversion implemented between some fields this ticket adds fallback code that goes through a RR/CC intermediate. Example:

```
sage: SR(CBF(1+I))._convert(CDF)
...
AttributeError: 'PolynomialRing_field_with_category' object has no attribute 'complex_field'
```

It is not the role of the symbolic ring to decide which conversion should exist. Concerning the example provided, the only reasonable way to go is to improve `CBF` (see #24318).

Ah the symbolic ring does not decide that but the symbolic function code has to return the input type, and as long as this can be done with a few lines of code successfully it's certainly better to do so. Moreover this can handle cases that are unknown at the moment.

Your conversion code (when EVER it exists) will be called automatically BTW.

You are pretending that it is successful. Conversion is not a trivial task. Going through an intermediate ring is not innocent (especially with floating point).

> Moreover this can handle cases that are unknown at the moment.

For me it is: this proposal is hiding missing conversions that will remain unknown.


Again: the aim of the symbolic ring is not to be better than the rest of Sage. If a conversion does not exist, then it does not exist. It might be a bug, a mistake, but it is not the role of the symbolic ring to complete the conversion.

At least, the doctest mentioned in the ticket description should be solved by #24318 that is in needs review.

Okay, I tested #24318 and it works. This ticket should then add these doctests to `ex._convert`:

```
sage: SR(RBF(1))._convert({'parent':RDF})
1.0
sage: SR(CBF(1))._convert({'parent':RDF})
1.0
sage: type(_.pyobject())
<type 'sage.rings.real_double.RealDoubleElement'>
sage: SR(CBF(1+I))._convert({'parent':RDF})
1.0 + 1.0*I
sage: type(_.pyobject())
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
sage: SR(CBF(1+I))._convert({'parent':CDF})
1.0 + 1.0*I
```

The PR just adds some doctests (and makes minor formatting corrections).
