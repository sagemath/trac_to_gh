Ooops.


```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, 2, 2, range(4))
sage: ev = A.eigenvalues()          
sage: ev
[-0.5615528128088302?, 3.561552812808830?]
sage: ev[0]=300                     
sage: A.eigenvalues()                
[300, 3.561552812808830?]
```


I suspect eigenspaces and eigenmatrices might also need a look.

Change this in the def eigenvalues():


```
        x = self.fetch('eigenvalues')
        if not x is None:
            if not extend:
                x1=Sequence([])
                for i in x:
                    if i in self.base_ring():
                        x1.append(i)
                x=x1
            return x
```


to this (add an else...)


```
        x = self.fetch('eigenvalues')
        if not x is None:
            if not extend:
                x1=Sequence([])
                for i in x:
                    if i in self.base_ring():
                        x1.append(i)
                x=x1
            else:
                x = copy(x)
            return x
```

Ah, I forgot that you can have an immutable sequence.  Nice.

Also, I wonder if we can use Simon King's work on cached methods?  CCing him to get his thoughts.
