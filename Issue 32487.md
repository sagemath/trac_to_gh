There are a number of tests `... is SR` in the Sage library, as found by `git grep 'is SR' src/sage/`

These tests ignore symbolic subrings, as constructed by `SR.subring(...)`.

All or most of these uses should be changed to `isinstance(..., sage.rings.abc.SymbolicRing)`.

In addition to handling the case of subrings, this will help with modularization (#32601).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32724

Now that we have a passing patchbot, this LGTM. I think "the symbolic ring (or a symbolic subring)" is awkward to repeat so many times and would be better phrased "a symbolic ring," but it's not important.
