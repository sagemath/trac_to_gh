CC:  @dkrenn @egourgoulhon @orlitzky

There are a number of tests `... is SR` in the Sage library, as found by `git grep 'is SR' src/sage/`

These tests ignore symbolic subrings, as constructed by `SR.subring(...)`.

All or most of these uses should be changed to `isinstance(..., sage.rings.abc.SymbolicRing)` or `isinstance(..., sage.symbolic.ring.SymbolicRing)` (if the module already imports other things from `sage.symbolic`)

In addition to handling the case of subrings, this will help with modularization (#32601).

We leave a few uses of `is SR` to follow-up tickets #31988, #31999.

Now that we have a passing patchbot, this LGTM. I think "the symbolic ring (or a symbolic subring)" is awkward to repeat so many times and would be better phrased "a symbolic ring," but it's not important.
