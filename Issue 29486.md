Given a homomorphism `f: K[x] -> K[y]` of (multivariate) polynomial rings that respects the `K`-algebra structure, we can find preimages of `y` by computing normal forms modulo the graph ideal `(x-f(x))` in `K[y,x]` with respect to an elimination order. More generally, this works for morphisms of quotient rings `K[x]/I -> K[y]/J`, which allows to handle many types of ring homomorphisms in Sage.

This ticket constructs the graph ideal and implements the method `inverse` for ring homomorphisms. This functionality can then be used for related computations such as inverse images, kernels and subalgebra membership tests, which will be implemented on another ticket.

It turns out to be more convenient to implement `inverse_image` first, so this branch is now based on #9792 (kernel and inverse_image of (polynomial) ring homomorphisms).

I would appreciate if someone could give these tickets a review.

Is there a particular reason why you raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the inverse doesn't exist? I feel like it would be better as a `ValueError` (or maybe a `TypeError`).

Mainly for consistency with morphisms between vector spaces:


```
sage: f = (QQ^2).hom([[1,1], [1,1]], QQ^2)
sage: f.inverse()
...
ZeroDivisionError: matrix morphism not invertible
```


Morphisms can be composed using the multiplication operator, so with respect to that operation, a `ZeroDivisionError` sort of makes sense. Another option would be to raise an `ArithmeticError`. I do not have a strong opinion about this matter, though.

This reminds me that we should probably add an alias `__invert__` for ring homomorphisms as well, so that the syntax `~f` can be used.

I see, and I agree that it sort of makes sense. Then let us keep it as a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Please do so. Once that is done, this will be a positive review.

Thank you. I have rebased the branch and implemented `__invert__` -- not as an alias though, as it would not work well with inheritance.
