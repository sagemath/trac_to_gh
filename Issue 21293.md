Works.

`[-2*t+i for i in range(2*t)]` is not beatiful.

It is not needed to change `g.add_vertices(range(11))`, as `add_vertices()` can take an iterator. (Same does not apply to `add_cycle()`, but maybe it should.

What is the meaning of `new_verts = [self.add_vertex() for i in range(k)]`? `add_vertex()` has no return value.

`list(range(20))[10:20]` is odd.

Feel free to mark this as positive review without any changes, as this patch does not make any of those worst than they now are.
