CC:  @mantepse @tscrim @xcaruso

In several places the commutativity of a ring is tested via `isinstance(base_ring, sage.rings.ring.CommutativeRing)` rather than `base_ring in sage.categories.commutative_rings.CommutativeRings()`. This makes it impossible to have a nicely interacting ring that would just inherit from `Parent`.

Note that the answers from `ring.is_commutative()` and `ring in CommutativeRings()` could be different : the former tests the category initialization whether the second could involve some (possibly costly) checks.

Yet another tiny step, probably already noticed by Frederic:

Without the patch, after the function `PolynomialRing` delegates to `_single_variate`, we check

```
        if not isinstance(base_ring, ring.CommutativeRing):
            constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_general
```

which succeeds, because `A.<t> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)` does not inherit from `CommutativeRing`.

With the patch, however, we have instead

```
        if base_ring not in _CommutativeRings:
            constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_general
        elif base_ring in _CompleteDiscreteValuationRings:
            constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_cdvr
        elif base_ring in _CompleteDiscreteValuationFields:
            constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_cdvf
```

and, since `A in _CommutativeRings`, it is the last check here which succeeds.

It is only afterwards that things go wrong: the `element_class` of `PolynomialRing_cdvf` in the dense case is `Polynomial_generic_dense_cdvf`.  This class inherits from `Polynomial_generic_dense_inexact`, which looks wrong to me, because `LazyLaurentSeriesRing(QQ)` is an exact ring.

I don't know whom to ask at this point.  More precisely:

* why does `Polynomial_generic_dense_cdvf` inherit from `Polynomial_generic_dense_inexact` rather than `Polynomial_generic_dense`?  Note that this seems to be the only place where `Polynomial_generic_dense_inexact` is used.

* even if this is wrong, I think that this is only masking a further bug - `LazyLaurentSeriesRing` should work just the same over inexact rings.

hhmm, one then meets something like this

```
File "src/sage/rings/lazy_series.py", line 3375, in sage.rings.lazy_series.LazyDirichletSeries._format_series
Failed example:
    f = D([2, 0, 1/(1-z), 3]); f
Expected:
    (2)/1^s + ((1+z+z^2+z^3+z^4+z^5+z^6+O(z^7))/3^s) + (3)/4^s
Got:
    Traceback (most recent call last):

My guess is that is coming from `_lmul_`/`_rmul_` versus `_acted_upon_` not playing nicely. There are some annoying subtle incompatibilities that come up when dealing with `ModuleElement` and some Cython behaviors IIRC.
