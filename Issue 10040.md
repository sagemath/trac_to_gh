With the forthcoming 4.6.alpha2, I get this doctest failure on the Skynet machines cicero (x86-Linux-pentium4-fc) and fulvia (x86_64-SunOS-core2):

```python
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/tensor/differential_forms.py"

I will need to think some more about this.  After hearing about this bug, I built 4.6.alpha2 on my Mac OS 10.6 machine and ran the doctests there, all of which passed without errors.

I am currently building Sage on my Linux machine and hope to be able to reproduce that bug shortly.  In the meantime, could this be due to `cmp` behaving differently on different platforms?  This would seem very weird to me...

The problem seems to be in the coordinate patch code, I think.

Notice that:


```
sage: var('x,y,z')
(x, y, z)
sage: (x,y,z)<(y,x,z)
x < y
```


I think that comparing tuples of symbolic variables is not well-defined.  Instead, you might compare strings (i.e., call str() on each tuple)

Should this ticket be marked as "needs review"?

Regardless, I think resolving that design issue should be a separate ticket.

Good point -- that wouldn't make sense indeed.

I've put this up for review as #10053.  This patch just takes out the calls to the `__cmp__` member functions and replaces them with equivalent calls to `__eq__`.
