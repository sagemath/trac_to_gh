Having an iterator for Lyndon words with a fixed length and alphabet size is useful that does not return elements (e.g., the free Lie algebra). Moreover, by having less transient objects, we can also improve the speed.

Current branch:

```
sage: LW = LyndonWords(11,6)
sage: %time for x in LW: pass
CPU times: user 2.17 s, sys: 40 ms, total: 2.21 s
Wall time: 2.17 s

sage: LW = LyndonWords(11,7)
sage: %time for x in LW: pass
CPU times: user 20.7 s, sys: 20 ms, total: 20.7 s
Wall time: 20.7 s
```

vs old version:

```
sage: LW = LyndonWords(11,6)
sage: %time for x in LW: pass
CPU times: user 2.86 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 2.87 s
Wall time: 2.85 s

sage: LW = LyndonWords(11,7)
sage: %time for x in LW: pass
CPU times: user 26.8 s, sys: 12 ms, total: 26.8 s
Wall time: 26.7 s
```

Given #25262, it would be good to add a "long" doctest, so we can avoid performance regressions in future.

There seem to be Gray codes available, eg:

That is not really how #25262 is suppose to work, and I don't believe is a better way to catch regressions (there will be less noise, but the noise will still be there). However, I've added it.

Here is a naive implementation of the iterative FKM algorithm from Ruskey's book. I couldn't get http://puma.dimai.unifi.it/17_1_2/weston.pdf to work, and I haven't checked what it's advantage would be.

I won't steel the joy of timing this from you :-)

The "joy" of timing...sure...

Anyways...that was a good find. The FKM algorithm is *much* faster than what was previously there (approximately 4x faster):

```
sage: %time for l in generate_lyndon_words(11,6): pass
CPU times: user 1.74 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 1.78 s
Wall time: 1.76 s
sage: %time for l in FKM_iterative(11,6): pass
CPU times: user 452 ms, sys: 32 ms, total: 484 ms
Wall time: 432 ms

sage: %time for l in generate_lyndon_words(11,7): pass
CPU times: user 16.7 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 16.7 s
Wall time: 16.7 s
sage: %time for l in FKM_iterative(11,7): pass
CPU times: user 3.75 s, sys: 28 ms, total: 3.78 s
Wall time: 3.74 s
```


With Cython (approximate another 10x speedup):

```
sage: %time for l in FKM_iterative_cython(11,6): pass
CPU times: user 36 ms, sys: 20 ms, total: 56 ms
Wall time: 40.7 ms
sage: %time for l in FKM_iterative_cython(11,7): pass
CPU times: user 340 ms, sys: 12 ms, total: 352 ms
Wall time: 322 ms
```


I have merged in #25462 and added the Cython code in such a way as to not (add) conflict with #25659.

To be nicer with the words code use

The change in comment:13 is actually slower in both Python and Cython. It has something to do with how Python constructs these things internally (but I agree that it is counter-intuitive).
