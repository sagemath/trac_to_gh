Robert,

unfortunately I cannot get the patches to apply cleanly and there are various rejects. Sage 3.1.3.alpha1 should be out in a few hours. Could you please rebase them against that release and I will make sure they go in first. 

Cheers,

Michael

Robert,

I merged the four patches and the only issue is the following:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/real_mpfr.pyx           
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha2/tmp/real_mpfr.py", line 1900:
    sage: RR(-1.234567)._pari_()
Expected:
    -1.2345670000000000000
Got:
    -1.2345670000000000001
**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of  11 in __main__.example_58
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /scratch/mabshoff/release-cycle/sage-3.1.3.alpha2/tmp/.doctest_real_mpfr.py
         [10.8 s]
```

I don't changing the doctest is the solution here since the "Real Number Inputs Improved" patch from 3.1.2 was supposed to fix this. Or am I completely wrong here? Either way: feel free to add a patch here or in case it is something more than non-trivial open another ticket.

Cheers,

Michael

Actually, after those patches I get

Sit looks like a pari issue for sure. For example, I get 


```
