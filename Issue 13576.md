# Issue 13576: Typo in the docstring for echelon_coordinate_vector in FreeModules Documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13780

Original creator: knsam

Original creation time: 2012-11-30 18:18:25

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: FreeModule, echelon_coordinate_vector

There is a minor typo in the docstring for the function: `echelon_coordinate_vector` in the FreeModules reported in the sage-support mailing list [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/qhzchfrq-5M/discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/qhzchfrq-5M/discussion) by Philipp Kerling. 

>The description of the function "echelon_coordinate_vector" of sage.modules.free_module.FreeModule_submodule_with_basis_pid says: "Write v in terms of the user basis for self." while it should correctly read: "Write v in terms of the echelonized basis for self."

The patchbot complained about this patch which does not make much sense. I told it to rerun tests. Let's see what happens this times.

Thanks for looking into this! The patchbot seems to be happy now, inferring from its green light... :)
