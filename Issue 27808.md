this might need a tricky (?) check that the configuration is as needed for ecl.

otherwise, libatomic has no deps, and gc only depends on libatomic

Should we do these separately? If gc winds up being tricky, we can do the dead-simple libatomic in the meantime.

Let's do libatomic here, and gc in #28991. I'd like to get the easy ones out of the way and then we can spent as much time as it takes to do the tricky ones.

Works for me. `gc` finds it. `checking which libatomic_ops to use... external`
