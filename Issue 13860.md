# Issue 13860: Matrix.subdivide goes haywire if indices are not in increasing order

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: Bouillaguet

Original creation time: 2013-02-06 00:13:36

Assignee: jason, was


```
sage: M = identity_matrix(5)
sage: M.subdivide([4,1], [3,2])
sage: M
[1 0|0|0 0]
[-----++-----]
[0 1|0|0 0]
[0 0|1|0 0]
[0 0|0|1 0]
[-----++-----]
[0 0|0|0 1]
```


This is broken, and there is an easy fix.

The 'subdivide' method just needed its inputs sorted to work correctly.

The fix seems to work as expected. Could you please:
* Add your real name in the "Author" Field of the ticket
* Improve the documentation of the function (as discussed)
* Add a doctest enforcing that the problem is fixed

After that, the tickets get a positive review (if the patchbot agrees).

Then you should add you full name to the "Reviewers" field of the ticket, and mark it as "positive_review"
