# Issue 28959: Make Ehrhart series related function cached

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29196

Original creator: jipilab

Original creation time: 2020-02-14 12:29:51

CC:  selia @kliem

Currently, the construction for `ehrhart_series` and other related methods in `backend_normaliz` are not cached, which means that they need to be recreated every time they are called.

These functions should be cached.

This is the first try. The tests are not passing. It needs some fixing.

According to the documentation [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/cachefunc.html), this should do it.

Are the "work issues" resolved?


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-19 16:53:43

Obviously :-) We have a green bot.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-06-19 16:55:34

Well, ok, that doesn't mean anything if the bot doesn't have normaliz, which appears to be the case.

But I claim they are resolved anyway.

If latte_int is installed:

```
File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base_QQ.py", line 547, in sage.geometry.polyhedron.base_QQ.Polyhedron_QQ.?
Failed example:
    Q.ehrhart_quasipolynomial.is_in_cache()         # optional - latte_int
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False

Sorry, I missed that. Didn't have `latte_int` installed on my laptop. You need to give `is_in_cache` the same arguments of course.
