Of course.  If you want the aspect ratio to be 1, then use the aspect_ratio=1 argument, which controls the aspect ratio.  The figsize option controls the "figure size", i.e., the size of the entire figure.

Thanks for rebasing, I got the following errors. (But I do not switch the 'needs_review' flag unless somebody confirms this issue.)

The following tests failed:

It would be also nice to add :: in between each pair of different examples - this allows to run any of the examples provided in this patch immediately from reference guide.
