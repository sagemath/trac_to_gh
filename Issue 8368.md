(update makes colorbars work even when fill=False)

One thing I don't like about this is that you can't easily get a 1:1 aspect ratio plot - using figsize = [a,a] makes the overall figure square but not the plotted region.

Of course.  If you want the aspect ratio to be 1, then use the aspect_ratio=1 argument, which controls the aspect ratio.  The figsize option controls the "figure size", i.e., the size of the entire figure.

apply instead of previous patch (rebased for the new #8366)

OK.  I think I got into the habit of using figsize before aspect_ratio worked.  I will check the rebased version as soon as I can.

Thanks for rebasing, I got the following errors. (But I do not switch the 'needs_review' flag unless somebody confirms this issue.)

```
...
      File "/mnt/usb1/scratch/marik/sage-4.3.5-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/plot/contour_plot.py", line 193, in _render_on_subplot
        if options['colorbar']:
    KeyError: 'colorbar'

The following tests failed:

        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/plot/contour_plot.py"
Total time for all tests: 25.0 seconds
```


It would be also nice to add :: in between each pair of different examples - this allows to run any of the examples provided in this patch immediately from reference guide.

I fixed both issues in the above patch.

I also doctested contour_plot.py this time!Â  Things should work now.
