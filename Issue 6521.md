This passed all doctests in sage.matrix, sage.modules, and sage.groups.matrix_gps, so hopefully I got all of them.

Is there a deprecation warning now on .copy()?  I didn't see one on this patch.

Does there need to be?  I don't recall that in #111 there was, but maybe there is supposed to be?

Yes, there does need to be a deprecation warning.  #111 was *way* before we had the deprecation warning policy, so that's why it wasn't mentioned there.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of code (including my code!) has used the .copy() function since then that would break.  We need to give us poor folks a warning that things are changing.

Unfortunately, the patch for #111 was only merged a few weeks ago, and is new in 4.1.1!   That means that you should probably open a followup patch for putting deprecation warnings in for all of those.   And then opening another patch that says to remove them in 6 months...

Ouch, okay.  I'll post a quick patch to this ticket (since I know at least some of my stuff will break) and open up a follow-up ticket for the rest of the stuff in #111.

positive review for kcrisman's patch.

kcrisman, can you review my patch?  It adds the deprecation warning.

Looks okay, passes relevant tests.  I hadn't seen that doctest:...: thing before, it's good to know about.

I got the following doctest failures. Except for the twist.py related failure, these are all a direct consequence of having deprecated the method `.copy()`.

The -fixes.patch should take care of all of those doctest failures.

Merged patches in this order:

 1. `trac_6521-copy-matrix.patch`
 1. `trac_6521-deprecation.patch`
 1. `trac_6521-deprecation-fixes.patch`

All doctests pass.
