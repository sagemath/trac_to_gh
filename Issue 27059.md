rather use `Wiener-Araya_graph` in wikipedia link to `Wienerâ€“Araya_graph` to avoid  the unicode dash symbol.

otherwise, good to go

The french wikipedia page of the Sousselier graph contains currently much more information than the english one. [Graphe_de_Sousselier](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphe_de_Sousselier) vs. [Sousselier_graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sousselier_graph).
I did not changed it when working on #25590 for that. May be we could have both links ?

Here is a new branch where:
* changes in giac interface are now made in #23313,
* wikipedia links have been corrected as suggested.

Needs review now
