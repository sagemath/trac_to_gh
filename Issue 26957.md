Some doctest fixes so that riemann_surface.py tests OK under Py3 as well as Py2. One doctest remains, due to `graph.genus` not working. This should be fixed by another ticket.

Little nitpick, but could you make the tests be more PEP8 compliant? In particular, spaces around the `=` and after the `#`? Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
