Currently many modules cannot be imported without prior loading of `sage.all` (or for other reasons). This is however needed for modularization and for running them with pytest.

They can be found using the following script (run via `./sage`)

```
import importlib.util
import pathlib
for file in pathlib.Path().glob("src/sage/**/*.py"):
    try: 
        spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("module.name", file)
        module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
        spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    except:
        print(file)
```
