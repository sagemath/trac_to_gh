# Issue 26793: show(f) after assume(x > 0, x < 1)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27030

Original creator: @kendonB

Original creation time: 2019-01-08 03:54:14

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: show, assume

The behavior of `show` could be improved using `assume`.

Start with:

```
x = var('x')
f(x) = 1 - x
assume(x < 1, x > 0)
```

The current behavior is that `show(f)` will output `x - 1`, whereas a human mathematician would always write this as `1 - x`.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
