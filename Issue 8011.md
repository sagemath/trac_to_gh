Needs to be rather severely updated, most likely, to actually compile, but why not?  Though there are other tutorials out there.

See https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/296

Proposing to close all sagenb tickets as outdated, so that all remaining open tickets in the notebook component are about the Jupyter notebook.
