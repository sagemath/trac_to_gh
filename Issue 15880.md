Looks good, could not find a typo by eyeball, congratulations. I found it easy going and motivating. I cannot comment on correctness, so please someone look at that and give positive.

Thank you for the quick review! It would be great if my students can see that what they are learning in class is already in Sage :-) !

Hey Anne,

I've made a couple of changes:

- removed tab characters,
- some minor grammar corrections,
- added a reference for Stanley's book and links in the tutorial,
- added link to splay trees in Tsetlin library,
- changed the format for edges in the digraph, and
- other misc formatting tweaks.

If you're happy with my changes, then it's a positive review.

Underscores are not valid identifiers in TeX:

```
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.18566 \bibitem[Bidigare_1997]{Bidigare_1997}
                                              {\phantomsection\label{algebra...

? 
! Emergency stop.
```

Thanks, that should be fixed now!
