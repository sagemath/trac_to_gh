CC:  slelievre dimpase roed was klee slabbe vdelecroix

GitHub has many features that are superior to the ones trac provides. For example, pull request reviews, code view and navigation, issue management with projects and labels, [GitHub](GitHub) actions for automatic code checks and other automation. Moreover, it's the de facto standard for open source projects.

For this reason, I would propose to migrate to [GitHub](GitHub).
The following needs to be done in this process:
- Make it possible to contribute via Github Pull Requests (this is the most important one for me as a 'simple' contributor).
- Replace/integrate patchbot by [GitHub](GitHub) actions. Refs #28936
- Migrate existing issues

(feel free to add things that I've overlooked.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30363

There once was a bot called sageb0t that would transform
any pull request opened on the SageMath repo at GitHub
to a ticket on the Sage Trac server. The bot was lost.

There is now a mechanism that will transform any merge request
opened against the SageMath repo at GitLab into a ticket
on the Sage Trac server. Read more about this mechanism:

I would argue that a simple bot that converts github pull requests and issues to trac is not enough in the long term. It might ease the transition period, but also duplicates the infrastructure. Moreover, you don't get to enjoy the above mentioned benefits if pull requests are still reviewed here on trac etc.

Are there any issues that prevent a clear one-time migration of the current issues and code contributions to github, say using tools like https://github.com/trustmaster/trac2github.

Let's not get bogged down in political discussions here -  we're paying about US$4000 to Google for trac hosting, and Google is not an angel, either. Even if we create our own exclusively solar panel and wind power generator operating hosting site for trac, we still will be reliant on various arguably evil parties to be operational.

Besides, GitLab's free tier (and not only) is lacking in functionality compared to GitHub, and https://gitlab.com/sagemath
is semi-broken, in part due to this, in part due to lack of attention.

I bring this up just to figure out if we want to be explicit about some policy in advance that we can point to if such a situation arises.  For example:

I just looked further, and found that [Admins](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization) have the ability to "merge pull requests on protected branches, even if there are no approving reviews."  So I think that takes care of my technical objection.  It still may be worth codifying a social policy like I described to help in situations where people get stuck, but I'm fine putting that off for now.

I tend to agree with this too. We could say that write permission can be requested - as a convenience if that developer is very active and finds themselves inconvenienced by the extra hassle.

We've been talking about `:trac:` directives, but there is a bigger problem: `git grep trac.sagemath.org src/` yields lots of hits, and all of those links are going to be broken if we get rid of the trac server.
