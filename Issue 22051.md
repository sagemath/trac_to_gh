# Issue 22051: Change size arrow head in directed graphs

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: johanneshuisman

Original creation time: 2017-02-01 20:53:36

Keywords: digraph, plot, arrow head, size

It would be nice to be able to change the size of arrow heads in directed graphs:


```
G=digraphs.Complete(3)
G.show(arrowsize=1)
```


The option arrowsize is not passed through to arrow2d, unlike other options as edge_thickness for example.
