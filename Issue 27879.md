Tried on py2-based and py3-based [SageMath](SageMath) on macOS 10.10.5. All tests pass.

Will test on Linux and Windows too before giving positive review (unless someone beats me to it).

Samuel was getting one test failure from this on Windows--there was some unhandled unicode error coming from Cython but I haven't tried to reproduce it yet.  I'll test this now...

Nevermind, this doesn't have anything to do with Cython (it just happened to occur in the `sage.misc.cython` tests).  There's one test that raises an error from GCC and the locale was in French ("compilation terminÃ©").  Sage's doctest runner bugs out on Python 2 on tracebacks containing non-ASCII characters.

I'm still testing this ticket anyways but I suspect it will be fine.

Should we upgrade to Cython 0.29.13 which came out in the meantime?

In principle I don't mind, but only if the ticket will actually be reviewed (if this ticket stalls again, then maybe Cython 0.29.14 will be released, leading to an endless cycle).

I'm ready to give this positive review--if you want to change it to 0.29.13 I'll rebuild and, assuming no problem, will also give it positive review today or by Wednesday (mostly afk tomorrow).
