CC:  @dimpase @jhpalmieri @orlitzky

As observed, for example, in #31267:
Build SPKG `readline`, build SPKG `singular` (which has the dependency on `readline`); then removing the SPKG `readline` and using the system readline does not trigger a rebuild of `singular`.

This is caused by a shortcoming of our build system: All system packages are represented by the target `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/.dummy` - which is old.
