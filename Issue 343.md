In Firefox, if you make a long (~50 line) input cell, with your cursor towards the bottom, and hit the tab key, focus (in the input cell) bounces to the top -- though the cursor stays where it was. In many cases, it actually scrolls the cursor out of view.

I can't reproduce this either.  It's been quite awhile ago and the notebook has been reworked since then.  I'm going to mark this as invalid.
