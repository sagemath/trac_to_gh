We remove the constructor argument `structure` and the private field `_structure` in the manifold class (and its subclasses). Instead, now inheritance is used to provide the information that originally were controlled by the structure. That is, the subclasses control now this data by either specifying it in the constructor (e.g. `_name_modifer` variable that be one of 'topological', 'differentiable', etc) or by overwriting methods (e.g. `scalar_field_algebra`). 

Currently, the structure combines two aspects. Namely on one hand information that is in the definition of the manifold (e.g. if charts are real-valued) and on the other hand data that a manifold may carry in addition (e.g. Riemannian metric).
This leads to a bit of code duplication and potentially strange behavior.
For example, one can construct a topological manifold (using the TopologicalManifold constructor) that has the "structure" of a differentiable manifold. Another example is that one has different "structures" of Lorentzian and (pseudo-)Riemannian metrics, but in the end there is no intrinsic difference there except for the signature. In particular, these are all just differentiable manifolds at the core (and thus have the same algebra of smooth functions etc).

Based on the discussion in #33001.

Discussion points:
- Currently, a complex manifold is displayed as "1-dimensional complex manifold M" if its differentiable and as "Complex 1-dimensional topological manifold M" if its only topological. I find this somewhat confusing. What do you think about "Complex 3-dimensional differentiable/topological manifold M"?
- Should the display text be really "degenerate_metric manifold M" with underscore?

To be honest, I don't understand the purpose of this ticket. Didn't we agree in #33001 to keep the structure implementation and set some keywords argument triggers instead?

Why do you change this?


```diff
             # trivial cases
             if self == 1:
-                self._mixed_forms[nab] = A(dom._one_scalar_field)
+                self._mixed_forms[nab] = A(dom.scalar_field_algebra().one())
             elif self == 0:
-                self._mixed_forms[nab] = A(dom._zero_scalar_field)
+                self._mixed_forms[nab] = A(dom.scalar_field_algebra().zero())
```


That was done on purpose. Besides, that is not part of this ticket.

Another thing I noticed already in other tickets:


```diff
         for dom in domain.open_supersets():
-            dom._zero_scalar_field._express[self] = self.function_ring().zero()
-            dom._one_scalar_field._express[self] = self.function_ring().one()
+            dom.scalar_field_algebra().zero()._express[
+                self
+            ] = self.function_ring().zero()
+            dom.scalar_field_algebra().one()._express[self] = self.function_ring().one()
```


Imho, line breaks like this make the code much harder to read.

In general, I would appreciate if you stick to the conventions that are already in the code. Switching back and forth between different conventions within one module (or file) just leaves mess.

In particular, I don't like that you add typing for just some parts. I'd prefer if we add typing for everything at once or leave things as they are (for now), but not some kind of hybrid.

#33001 is about the `structure` argument to the manifold builder, which is not touched in this ticket here. To reference to #33001 is only insofar relevant as I realized during the discussion that the different structures (as defined in `structure.py`) are not really needed; and this ticket here implements this idea.

Previously, the fields `_scalar_field_algebra` as well as `_one_scalar_field` and `_zero_scalar_field` were set in the constructor of `TopologicalManifold`. I removed these variables because now the differentiable manifold creates the correct scalar field algebra by overwriting `scalar_field_algebra`. I think this strategy also fixed a bug where an open subset of a diff manifold only had the scalar algebra of a topological manifold, see one of the changed doctests. (Also the code previously referenced protected variables from outside the class which is usually not a good idea.)

That's because of the line length limit (of 80?). I usually use `black` to format the code I've changed so that it adheres to this limit (and to fix other pep8 issues automatically).

> In particular, I don't like that you add typing for just some parts. I'd prefer if we add typing for everything at once or leave things as they are (for now), but not some kind of hybrid.

I think it's just not feasible to fully type all of sage (or even of a single class) in one ticket. I think the spirit "add typing for the code you touch" seems a nice guide, because then the developer and reviewer are already familiar with the corresponding code. But I'm happy to follow a different approach if that's the consensus. (Also note Frédéric Chapoton already added a bit of typing here and there in other tickets, just not for manifolds.)
