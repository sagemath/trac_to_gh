In sage/symbolic/relation.py inside a warning block a "{does}" should be replaced by "*does*".

I'm OK with jpflori's patch. However, note that it doesn't have the ticket number in the commit message. The ticket number is very useful when debugging merge conflicts between patches to be merged, and those patches that are already in Sage. The patch [attachment:trac-10079_typo-fix-symbolic-relation.patch] is the same as jpflori's patch, but with the ticket number in the commit message. Positive review to jpflori's fix. See the ticket description for instruction on which ticket to merge.
