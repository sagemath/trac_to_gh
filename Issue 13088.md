We've long needed a substantial, graded set of tutorials starting from absolute scratch geared toward new mathematical users of Sage who do not have any particular programming background.  In the PREP workshops the last three years, such a series of tutorials, including eight disciplinary "quickstarts" and an intro to interacts, have taken good shape, and are ready for inclusion.

Apply [attachment:trac_13260-tutorials.patch], [attachment:trac_13260-quickstarts.patch], and [attachment:trac_13260-images.patch].

Recommended reviewing method is to apply all three patches, build the documentation, and then look at it.  Then one can refer to the relevant patch in review.

```
sage -docbuild prep html
sage -docbuild website html
```

is what I usually do.

Putting author as me because I did the work on actually turning it all into .rst files, but the project authors in conf.py are all three of the original authors from the 2010 PREP.  For positive review, I would want at least one person NOT involved as a leader in the 2010 or 2011 workshops to review this, but of course they are also welcome to give this partial review!  *Participants* in said workshops would be more than welcome to help give positive review.

There are quite a lot of empty lines (especially before `::`) are they all necessary?

Remove trailing white spaces and replace the tabs.

The maximum line length should be about 79 characters, at least for the text parts.

Yes, the empty lines are all necessary.  This is not the same as Sage code, it's the documentation.

Unless you mean that one could do 

```
Do this thing::

    sage: do_it()
```


instead of 

```
Do this thing.

::

    sage: do_it()
```


I'm not sure which looks nicer right now in the built doc.

There shouldn't be any trailing whitespace or tabs left.

Line length noted - this was from some other stuff, but you are right about this, of course.

I am all +1 on that project. You may also want to have a look at

http://combinat.sagemath.org/doc/thematic_tutorials/index.html

which contains the tutorial we are using during Sage-Combinat days and that we want to get progressively merged into Sage too.

Hmm, looks like a more expanded version of some of this stuff in the more detailed topics, and a shorter version of this in the intro versions.

I personally think that either of these sets are more appropriate than the current "tutorial", which dates from the days when the Sage user could be expected to have familiarity with the command line etc.   Feel free to cc: me on some of your things as they become ready for review.

Meanwhile, I'm working on slowly removing the whitespace and justifying... a little tedious since I'm not a power editor user :8

Actually, I HAD all of those plots and removed them!  That's what #10637 does - it keeps as many images as possible.  But I got rid of them because they aren't present in any other Sage documentation.

The problem is that there is the "live" documentation as well as the "static" documentation, and putting images in one means that in the other you would get two images when you evaluated it.  I didn't want to try to fight that, though maybe I should have at least *kept* the images!

I put the main tutorial images in media, but kept the two for quickstarts in the quickstarts.  The other docs in doc/en seems to switch back and forth.  Also because I don't like typing `../filename` because it's more breakable.  But either is fine, if it's important.

Okay, I have heard of this file but don't really understand it.  Why wouldn't I have to do anything for the .rst files, just the images?  Precisely which files have to be in there?  Thanks.

MANIFEST.in is [documented here](http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest-template). The second line of the file is

```
recursive-include doc *.rst *.py *.inc
```

so all .py and .rst files are included automatically. I'm not sure why we don't do this for png files; I guess that building the documentation without the jsMath option can generate lots of png files that we don't need to include. So anyway, you have to include any png files in there, with a syntax like

```
include doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Rplot001.png
include doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/heawood-graph-latex.png
recursive-include doc/en/prep/media *
```

probably somewhere near the bottom with the rest of the lines related to the doc directory. (The order doesn't matter, but it's nice if the file is somewhat organized.) You can test it by running `sage --sdist ...` and making sure that the appropriate files are included in the Sage spkg.

The problem was that it should be `HaveSignin.png` - I have fixed this.

Thank you so much for helping with this.

Done.  As far as I can tell with my modest grep skillz.  Any very minor remaining ones could be fixed in a reviewer patch, of course.

Okay, all that is done.  I ended up moving all the images to the media directory for `MANIFEST.in` ease of use.

I still don't know why the tutorials patch doesn't preview correctly.  The manifest changes is in the images patch.

Patchbot, apply trac_13260-tutorials.patch, trac_13260-quickstarts.patch, and trac_13260-images.patch.

One remaining issues might be that the images showing the worksheets are quite large compared to many browser window sizes.  On the other hand,

More comments welcome.

I'll just separate these out for now, then, and create a new ticket for them.  That will be a big enough change in the images patch that it will need another brief review just to make sure I got everything I was supposed to, and might as well check that the other changes did indeed work.

This was trickier.  Moving the "skips" fixed the typesetting problem, but then the cells weren't skipped in doctesting.  I fixed this by just adding the `# not tested` business.

Ok, I see what you mean.  I had single backticks instead of doubles.

As long as no one minds, although I removed the quickstart stuff from this ticket, I left the (two) images, because I wasn't sure how to hg rm a file from within the middle of a queue.  I seriously doubt this will cause any problems.

For my own reference:

```
In the :doc:`Quickstart tutorials <quickstart>`, we assume
familiarity with the topics at the level of a student who has just
completed a course in the subject, or of a faculty member who is about
to teach it.
