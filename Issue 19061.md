In #18323 and in a recent thread packages were identified that need C++11 more or less urgently. They need different subsets of C++11. The first full featured C++11 gcc version is 4.8.1. The version shipped with Sage at the moment is 4.9.2. This ticket should implement install/usage of Sage's gcc if the native gcc version is less than 4.8.1. The resp. package tickets will depend on this ticket and activate the C++11 switch in their compile process.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19298

I don't understand. With this patch and `make` it will start to build gcc (toolchain) although my native gcc is 4.8.3.

Can you please be more concrete? Because I find this too vague: "In #18323 and in a recent thread packages were identified"
