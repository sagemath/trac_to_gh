In #13579, for security reasons and modularity, we moved temporary filename constructors from `sage.misc.misc` to their own module.  Most things were moved with it, but [a](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l557) [couple](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/33242a07d2ab/sage/plot/animate.py#l381) places in animate.py were missed.  Let's make sure they are **all** fixed in this ticket.

See [this ask.sagemath.org question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2065/module-object-has-no-attribute-graphics_filename) for a real-life bug this caused.

Incidentally, ran into the `sage -n` not starting while testing this... so I'm glad that will be fixed before the final 5.5, right?

This makes sense, but unfortunately it doesn't actually show up in the notebook.  In fact, even at the command line it shows up in the current working directory, which is *not* standard Sage behavior for graphics, though it is the documented behavior.  My personal preference would be to have it changed, but that wouldn't be this ticket.  What do you think the "right" behavior should be for the notebook and `EMBEDDED_MODE`?  Not that I'm angling for a line for that situation, but it would be nice to have.

Actually, this must be a really old function, since `matrix_plot` does what we want here.  `hg blame` tells me it's an addition by malb from **2007**!
> I don't think it's possible to add a doctest to animate.py, since those require ImageMagick or similar to run.
Sounds reasonable, as I suspected but hoped against.

Sorry about asking the matrix notebook question.  I hate it when we discover bugs or unneeded functionality when trying to do very routine fixes.  I'd be tempted to just can the function entirely, except there's the deprecation period and we should probably ask Martin if  it's needed...

Random annoyance this has nothing to do with.

Are these actual unused branches or is the compiler just blowing off steam?  Anyway, not worrisome here.
> For the `sage -n` problem, see #13794. I think the scripts patch at #11409 will fix it.
Yes, I just couldn't remember the ticket numbers, I wasn't actually complaining.
