CC:  @dkrenn @cheuberg @thhagelmayer

The setup for getting a `TermMonoidFactory` in doctests in `sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid` currently looks like


```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import TermMonoidFactory
sage: TermMonoid = TermMonoidFactory('__main__.TermMonoid')
```


when in fact the already available `DefaultTermMonoidFactory` could be used via, e.g.,


```
sage: from sage.rings.asymptotic.term_monoid import DefaultTermMonoidFactory as TermMonoid
```


On top of that, the note on lines 3985--3987 in `term_monoid.py` should be adapted accordingly (currently it is not true).
