In the doc, ok, why not. But I would rather not change anything in the code and doctest results, because we are very far from being ready to use that.

```

To say it once again,

```
+ name=u'Poincaré Disk Model', short_name="PD",
```

and

```
+ name='Triangulation of the Poincaré homology 3-sphere')
```

are changes that we are potentially not ready to handle, and that should rather wait until a fully-utf8-aware doctesting framework is ready.

I am not happy about that, but I would prefer to be very cautious for the moment.
