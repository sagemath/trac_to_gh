This patch will change Poincare to Poincaré, except one place that is handled in #22734.

Can't do more until Python 3 and real Unicode support.

In the doc, ok, why not. But I would rather not change anything in the code and doctest results, because we are very far from being ready to use that.

and do not forget to add the utf-8 encoding first line when needed.

Don't worry, I did not change those.

Good point. Changed, now compiling and testing.

To say it once again,

```
+ name=u'Poincaré Disk Model', short_name="PD",
```

and

```
+ name='Triangulation of the Poincaré homology 3-sphere')
```

are changes that we are potentially not ready to handle, and that should rather wait until a fully-utf8-aware doctesting framework is ready.

I am not happy about that, but I would prefer to be very cautious for the moment.
