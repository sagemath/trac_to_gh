# Issue 25016: Singular can't handle nested lists

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25253

Original creator: @BrentBaccala

Original creation time: 2018-04-26 17:19:29

CC:  @mwageringel

Keywords: Singular

There doesn't seem to be any way to create nested lists using Sage's Singular interface:


```
sage: b = singular.list([1, 2, [3, 4]])
sage: b
[1]:
   1
[2]:
   2
[3]:
   4*gen(2)+3*gen(1)
sage: b = singular.list([1, 2, singular.list([3, 4])])
```


The last command just hangs indefinitely.

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

integer_types is no longer available, just use int

As suggested, I have removed the use of `integer_types`. Other than that, this looks good to me. If the bots are happy, we can set this to positive.
