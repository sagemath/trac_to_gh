Good cleanup. Maybe take the opportunity to fix a typo:


```
-    Return the genus of a two times a quadratic form over `\ZZ`.
+    Return the genus of two times a quadratic form over `\ZZ`.
```


and to turn "Conway-Sloane" into a proper reference;
probably it's this book?

But also okay to call these further things out of scope here.

Voici. J'en ai profité pour unifier les 2 références au même livre.
