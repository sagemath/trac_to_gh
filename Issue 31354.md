`MemoryAllocator` doesn't rely on anything in sage, hence we expose it as independet python package. It can be useful for other cython projects.

In order to remove the dependency on `cysignals`, which at the moment doesn't work on windows without cygwin, we remove `sig_block`/`sig_unblock` from the allocation. The seems not harmful as the allocation via `MemoryAllocator` should not be called within `sig_on`/`sig_off` anyway.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31591

```
