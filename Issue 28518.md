I don't see any good reason to print the contents of the build directory:

```
The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):

* package: cliquer-1.21.p4

```

For most users, the log file has the relevant information.

For the timestamp itself, in principle it's a good idea, but using `ls -l` gives extraneous information, and unfortunately it's the first information printed: file permissions, owner, group, etc. The most important thing is the location of the file, second is the timestamp.

Now I see this, which I like better:

```
Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all-start'):

* package:         pari_galdata-20080411.p0
  last build time: Jan 24 10:25
  log file:        /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/28755/sage-9.1.beta1/logs/pkgs/pari_galdata-20080411.p0.log

* package:         pari_seadata_small-20090618.p0
  last build time: Jan 24 10:25
  log file:        /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/28755/sage-9.1.beta1/logs/pkgs/pari_seadata_small-20090618.p0.log
  build directory: /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/28755/sage-9.1.beta1/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pari_seadata_small-20090618.p0
ls: /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/28755/sage-9.1.beta1/logs/pkgs/../doc*.log: No such file or directory

It is safe to delete any log files and build directories, but they
contain information that is helpful for debugging build problems.
WARNING: If you now run 'make' again, the build directory of the
same version of the package will, by default, be deleted. Set the
environment variable SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS=yes to prevent this.

make[1]: *** [all-start] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2
```

However I do not like the error message

```
ls: /Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/28755/sage-9.1.beta1/logs/pkgs/../doc*.log: No such file or directory
```
