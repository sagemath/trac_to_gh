Assignee: jason, was

CC:  simonking @miguelmarco

Adds three methods to the matrix morphism class:

1.  `is_bijective()`
2.  `is_identity()`
3.  `inverse()`

I did not notice that `__invert___` via ~ was available by using tab-completion, which should explain the last one.

If there is a theme, it is better support for compositions of these morphisms.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11553

The surjectivity test doesn't work fine over other euclidian domains:



```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: A=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: B=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: H=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([x^2,1])])
sage: H   
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[x^2 - 1       1]
[    x^2       1]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]        
sage: H.is_surjective()
False
sage: H.is_injective()
True
sage: H.inverse()
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[      -1        1]
[     x^2 -x^2 + 1]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.is_identity()
False

```



But 



```
sage: F=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([-x^2,-1])])
sage: F.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]     
sage: F.is_surjective()
True
sage: F.is         
sage: F.is_identity()
False
```



I think the problem is in ticket 11552, it still needs work.

Strikes me there is a more general problem with free module equality, which I will ask about on sage-devel:


```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a')
sage: x = vector(R, [1, 0])
sage: y = vector(R, [0, 1])
sage: z = vector(R, [0,-1])
sage: A = (R^2).span([x, y])
sage: B = (R^2).span([x, z])
sage: A == B
False
sage: A.is_submodule(B)
True
sage: B.is_submodule(A)
True
```


which at its root might be


```
sage: S = matrix([x, y])
sage: S._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: T = matrix([x, z])
sage: T._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]
```

v3 patch makes `is_identity()` more robust, adds `is_zero()` and a test to see if two matrix morphisms are equal *as functions*, not just that they have the same representation.

A few methods are relocated within the file, as well, to group things more logically.

Martin,

Thanks for the improvements.  The changes in the review patch look good to me, and pass tests in sage/modules, sage/matrix.  So, as suggested, I've set this to positive review.

4.7.2.alpha1 + #11552 + #10793

Rebased main patch to make v4 patch.  This was a trivial change.

Got bit by the nasty bug that is fixed in #10793, so two doctests needed to have their matrix dimensions reversed (maybe not really transposes *per se*).  This minor change to the code is on the "doctests" patch and should require a (simple) review.

"review-v2" patch is a trivial rebase to eliminate a fuzz warning.  I'm going to presume this does not need a change in review status.
