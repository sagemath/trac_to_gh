Assignee: jason, was

CC:  simonking mmarco

Adds three methods to the matrix morphism class:

1.  `is_bijective()`
2.  `is_identity()`
3.  `inverse()`

I did not notice that `__invert___` via ~ was available by using tab-completion, which should explain the last one.

If there is a theme, it is better support for compositions of these morphisms.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11553

The surjectivity test doesn't work fine over other euclidian domains:



```
sage: R=PolynomialRing(QQ,'x')
sage: A=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: B=FreeModule(R,2)
sage: H=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([x^2,1])])
sage: H   
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[x^2 - 1       1]
[    x^2       1]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]        
sage: H.is_surjective()
False
sage: H.is_injective()
True
sage: H.inverse()
Free module morphism defined by the matrix
[      -1        1]
[     x^2 -x^2 + 1]
Domain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
Codomain: Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain ...
sage: H.is_identity()
False

```



But 



```
sage: F=A.hom([B([x^2-1,1]),B([-x^2,-1])])
sage: F.image()
Free module of degree 2 and rank 2 over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
Echelon basis matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]     
sage: F.is_surjective()
True
sage: F.is         
sage: F.is_identity()
False
```



I think the problem is in ticket 11552, it still needs work.

Strikes me there is a more general problem with free module equality, which I will ask about on sage-devel:


```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'a')
sage: x = vector(R, [1, 0])
sage: y = vector(R, [0, 1])
sage: z = vector(R, [0,-1])
sage: A = (R^2).span([x, y])
sage: B = (R^2).span([x, z])
sage: A == B
False
sage: A.is_submodule(B)
True
sage: B.is_submodule(A)
True
```


which at its root might be


```
sage: S = matrix([x, y])
sage: S._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: T = matrix([x, z])
sage: T._echelon_form_PID()[1]
[ 1  0]
[ 0 -1]
```

v3 patch makes `is_identity()` more robust, adds `is_zero()` and a test to see if two matrix morphisms are equal *as functions*, not just that they have the same representation.

A few methods are relocated within the file, as well, to group things more logically.

4.7.2.alpha1 + #11552 + #10793

Rebased main patch to make v4 patch.  This was a trivial change.

Got bit by the nasty bug that is fixed in #10793, so two doctests needed to have their matrix dimensions reversed (maybe not really transposes *per se*).  This minor change to the code is on the "doctests" patch and should require a (simple) review.
