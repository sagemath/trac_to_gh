Moved from compositions to integer vectors because Sage `Composition`s should not have zero entries.

This will not quite work as the parent might require the integer vector to have a fixed length. You should simply return an element in _all_ integer vectors. You can also more directly construct the elements by `P.element_class(P, foo, check=False)` (which will also make this faster) since you can assume you started with an integer vector.

Makes senses, thanks!
