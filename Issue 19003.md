# Issue 19003: Rename matrix_mod2e_dense to matrix_gf2e_dense

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19240

The name `matrix_mod2e_dense` suggests that it's about matrices in `Z/(2^e)Z`, while it's really for matrices in `GF(2^e)`.

Even if you think that no deprecation is needed, I do believe that it is at least needed to be able to read old pickles of matrices over `GF(2^e)`. Users are likely to have those stored somewhere, as part of ubiquitous applications.

I don't see how you take care of that in your commit.

Apparently there is a malformed docstring:

```
Error building the documentation.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/king/Sage/git/sage/src/doc/common/builder.py", line 1626, in <module>
    getattr(get_builder(name), type)()
  File "/home/king/Sage/git/sage/src/doc/common/builder.py", line 292, in _wrapper
    getattr(get_builder(document), 'inventory')(*args, **kwds)
  File "/home/king/Sage/git/sage/src/doc/common/builder.py", line 503, in _wrapper
    x.get(99999)
  File "/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python/multiprocessing/pool.py", line 558, in get
    raise self._value
OSError: [matrices ] docstring of sage.matrix.matrix_gf2e_dense.unpickle_matrix_gf2e_dense_v0:15: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

I try to fix it.

Done. Turn """ into r""".

Why is trac automatically changing the branch back to the old value?? Odd.

You didn't actually *introduce* the old-style raise statements that the plugin is complaining about, but anyway I'm fixing them...

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Since tests pass and the code and docstrings now seem fine, I'm giving it a positive review.

Unless of course you don't like my reviewer commits, or unless you worry about the patchbot reporting a slowdown in startup time (which I find hard to believe, given that you merely rename a module).
