Is this the only failing test with 4.2.1? Either way, I think we should change the tests to pass with >=singular-4.2.1, for two reasons. First, v4.2.1 is not that old, and it's polite to give distros some time to catch up. Second, testing for "patchlevel 2 or higher" is a pain in the ass because it doesn't show up in the pkg-config file.

Yes, this is the only failing test for me.

I'm not sure what's the purpose of this example/test. It seems to me the simplest thing is to tag it as "# not tested - requires singular >=4.2.1p2".

While it *is* a known bug, I don't see what benefit there is to (temporarily) recording one of the many possible wrong answers in the sage source code. Once the bug is fixed in #33178, the test will be brought back with the correct answer and a meaningful explanation.

We should find what we believe to be the correct answer and record it there.

From my experience, I would be skeptical of it reappearing. This doctest is testing something, but the answer doesn't necessarily reflect that. If we don't trust at least one way of generating the "answer," then the other algorithm should have big warnings attached to it.
