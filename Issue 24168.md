CC:  mmezzarobba cheuberg

As for the real field `RR` we introduce 4 methods to obtain the constants: pi, log(2), euler_constant, catalan_constant. We also provide pi on CBF (as it is for CC).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24405

Some trivial things:

- I think it is usually capitalized `Euler constant`.
- Double pi: `Return a ball enclosing `\sin(Ï€ \pi x)`.`
- Maybe ``\log(2)``?

Otherwise LGTM.
