Keywords: copy, vectorspace

There are some serious problems using deepcopy on vectorspaces where the inner_product_matrix is specified.  This fails over GF(p) for large primes, and over RR.

Please see also Ticket #10577 for a related problem over GF(2).


```
sage: V = VectorSpace(GF(46337), 2, inner_product_matrix=DiagonalMatrix(ZZ, [1,1]))
sage: deepcopy(V)
Ambient quadratic space of dimension 2 over Finite Field of size 46337
Inner product matrix:
[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: 
sage: V = VectorSpace(GF(46349), 2, inner_product_matrix=DiagonalMatrix(ZZ, [1,1]))
sage: deepcopy(V)
