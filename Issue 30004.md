(from #30169)

Currently, we have the following identifications:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3, name='M')
sage: M is M.exterior_power(1)
True
sage: M is M.tensor_module(1, 0)
True
```


In contrast:

```
sage: M.dual() is M.dual_exterior_power(1)
True
sage: M.dual() is M.tensor_module(0, 1)
False
```


The dual is implemented twice, as a special case of both `TensorFreeModule` and `ExtPowerDualFreeModule`.

We create a separate implementation class `FiniteRankDualFreeModule` for it.

By adding `__classcall_private__` methods, we delegate the construction to the new class for the special cases.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30241

This doesn't sound sensible to me. `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` and `TensorFreeModule` follow *very* different construction patterns. For a reason: even from the mathematical point of view, one forms and (0,1) tensors are constructed differently, though they are isomorphic.

From that perspective, the current implementation makes perfect sense. What would make more sense is implementing the isomorphism.

The same is true for `M.exterior_power(1)` and `M.tensor_module(1, 0)`, but we do have this identification.

Fair point. Then I would vote for changing this to the expected outputs rather than creating a whole new class which has no further purpose than everything that is already there.

Either way, I agree that consistency is desirable here.

Strictly speaking, they should return instances of `ExtPowerFreeModule` or `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` respectively, which are isomorphic to the base ring.

You definitely have a good point. And I totally agree that this should be unified, in either way.

But I am strictly against a new class dedicated to just one special case. At least, this is how I understand your proposal.

Thanks. Prompted by your remark, I have taken a look and I noticed that `VectorFieldModule` also has similar code. I have yet to study this code in detail (I am slowly making my way up the stack...), but it looks it has the same inconsistency between primal and dual:

```

sage: XM = M.vector_field_module()
sage: XM.tensor_module(1, 0) is XM
True
sage: XM.tensor_module(0, 1) is XM.dual()

I think I have a solution that could make everyone happy. 

In #30169, I had implemented `FiniteRankDualFreeModule.__classcall_private__` methods that delegate to other classes and implement the identification.

But we could as well take care of all identifications in the `FiniteRankModule.exterior_power`, `dual_power`, `tensor_module` methods.

Then the class constructors `ExtPowerFreeModule` could keep the strict behavior (I would also check that the case of degree 0 is correctly implemented - I don't think it is currently).

Looks good, thanks. There are some minor issues regarding the documentation of class `FiniteRankDualFreeModule`:

```diff
-     the *dual of* `M` is the set `M^*` of all linear forms `p` on `M`,
+     the *dual of* `M` is the set `M^*` of all linear forms on `M`,
```



```diff
-    - ``name`` -- (default: ``None``) string; name given to `\Lambda^p(M^*)`
+    - ``name`` -- (default: ``None``) string; name given to `M^*`
```



```diff
-    EXAMPLES:
+    EXAMPLES::
```

It would also be nice to update the `AUTHORS` field of `finite_rank_free_module.py`.

You probably already know it, but just in case: instead of running `make doc` (which is so slow that one always hesitate to run it), a fast way to generate the documentation regarding tensors on finite rank free modules is 

```
sage -docbuild reference/tensor_free_modules html
```

The documentation is then located in `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/tensor_free_modules/index.html` under the Sage root directory. 

Michael, do you have any further comments?

Another issue regardng the documentation: in the html doc, the method `construction()` of `FiniteRankDualFreeModule` appears as an empty item, which is somewhat weird. This is because its docstring contains only a `TESTS` field. There should be at least something like "Not implemented yet" and/or the comment that appears only in the Python code (`No construction until we extend VectorFunctor with a parameter 'dual'`). Same remark about the `construction()` methods of `TensorFreeModule`, `ExtPowerFreeModule` and `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` after #30235.

I'll do this in a follow-up ticket to avoid a merge conflict with #30229.

Sorry, it's a long time ago I looked into this.

We want tensor products for dual elements, am I getting this right? Is the long term goal then to implement `ExtPowerDualFreeModule` as a quotient of tensor powers of `FiniteRankDualFreeModule`?
