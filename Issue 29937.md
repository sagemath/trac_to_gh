(from #30094)

```
sage: Q3 = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: Q3 in Modules(QQ)
True
sage: Modules(QQ)(Q3)
TypeError: 'FiniteRankFreeModule_with_category' object has no attribute 'vector_space'
unable to coerce x (=3-dimensional vector space over the Rational Field) into Category of vector spaces over Rational Field
```

Compare with:

```
sage: Modules(QQ)(QQ^3)
Vector space of dimension 3 over Rational Field
```

tscrim, #30094 comment 4:

  My 2 cents for the error reported in the ticket is to first check that the object is not in the category. The other option is to lift the vector_space method up to the category of modules and then implement a change_ring method for Q3.
