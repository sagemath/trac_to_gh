# Issue 14980: %cython doesn't work correctly with C++

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15217

Original creator: vbraun

Original creation time: 2013-09-22 20:52:38

For full C++ support we need to call `cython -cplus`. This is currently not done:

```
cython("""
#clang c++
cdef extern from "linbox/element/gmp-rational.h" namespace "LinBox":
    cdef cppclass GMPRationalElement:
        GMPRationalElement(int)
cdef GMPRationalElement* i = new GMPRationalElement(1)
""")
```

results in 

```
Error compiling Cython file:
------------------------------------------------------------
...
#clang c++
cdef extern from "linbox/element/gmp-rational.h" namespace "LinBox":
    cdef cppclass GMPRationalElement:
        GMPRationalElement(int)
        
cdef GMPRationalElement* i = new GMPRationalElement(1)
                                ^
------------------------------------------------------------

_home_vbraun__sage_temp_desktop_2912_tmp_u0QwxY_spyx_0.pyx:9:33: Operation only allowed in c++
```

This correctly uses C++ now. (The example still fails for a difference reason: it needs C++11 now).
