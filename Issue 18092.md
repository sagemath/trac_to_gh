Can you tell how it actually works?

There are two things you need to know:

1. The Cython "metaclass" mechanism implemented in #18330. This is similar to but not the same as a Python metaclass. It is a mechanism to change the `type()` of a Cython extension type and call the `__init__` method (but not `__new__`!) of the metaclass. Using the C preprocessor, a hook to implement this is added which is called whenever a Cython extension type is created.

2. This ticket uses that mechanism to manually inherit the `tp_compare` and `tp_richcompare` slots of extension types, see the code in `src/sage/misc/inherit_comparison.pyx` in the branch.

What do you mean with "would still be copied"? I don't understand what you're trying to say.

I still don't understand what it is supposed to mean. What do you mean by "manually inherit"?

See the comments in sage.structure.element:

    # For a derived Cython class, you **must** put the __richcmp__

My understanding was that with the ticket here it would in future NOT be needed to copy the `__cmp__` and `__richcmp__` methods.

An extension type with the `InheritComparisonMetaclass` "metaclass" will inherit `__cmp__` and `__richcmp__` from its base class if neither `__cmp__` nor `__richcmp__` is defined.

In practice, it means that we no longer need the boilerplate code

```
def __richcmp__(left, right, int op):
    return (<Element>left)._richcmp(right, op)

def __cmp__(left, right):
    return (<Element>left)._cmp(right)
```
in subclasses of `Element` since those will be inherited from `Element`.

As far as I know, there is not. There is some documentation in `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/coercion_and_categories.rst`, but that's really about Python only.

I do plan to write documentation in #18306, but I haven't gotten around to actually do it.

Since this would be ticket with a lot of potential conflicts, it's best if the author and potential reviewer agree in advance that such a thing be a good idea and to try to get that ticket merged quickly after a new beta comes out.
