Assignee: was

I can define this function in a xterm or in a emacs buffer linked to the sage shell buffer.

I get an error when I type it in the *Sage Inferior* mode.


```
def test (n) :
  if n==2 :
    return 2
  else :
    return 3
```

In emacs I get the error around the "else :" line


```
------------------------------------------------
  File "<ipython console>", line 4
    se :
      ^^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

sage:     return 3

-----------------------------------------------------
  File "<ipython console>", line 1
SyntaxError: 'return' outside function (<ipython console>, line 1)
```


This error isn't in the sage*.el mode because I get the same problem in any shell buffer that I run with [Alt-x] shell [return] sage [return].

```

FWIW typing it in without indenting works:


```

sage: def test(n) :
....: if n==2 :
....: return 2
....: else :
....: return 3
....: 
sage: test(2)
2
```


But indenting it "manually" causes problems:


```
def test (n) :
....:   if n==2 :
....:     return 2
....:   else :
------------------------------------------------------------
   File "<ipython console>", line 4
     se :
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```


In a shell, the proper indentation is added automatically i.e. the transcript below resulted from typing exactly the same characters as the first:

```
sage: def test(n) :
....:     if n==2:
....:         return 2
....:     else:
....:         return 3
....:     
sage: test(3)
3
```


It's probably related to the TERM environment variable (set to "dumb" inside emacs), but I don't know where this is handled in Sage (probably ipython).

This can be done by adding to `main()` in `ipy_user_conf.py`:


```

    import os
    if os.environ['TERM'] == 'dumb':
        o.autoindent = 0
```


I plan to wait until after #12167 to fix this.

Does it actually merge?

Also, wouldn't the same hold for plain IPython? Maybe its better to fix the default upstream?

Replying to [comment:4 vbraun]:
> Does it actually merge?

Sorry, I must have tried merging it when I had an old branch checked out.

> Also, wouldn't the same hold for plain IPython? Maybe its better to fix the default upstream?

Yes, you are right.  It probably should be fixed upstream.  You can close this ticket.

Can you link to the upstream ticket when you open it? IPython uses github as issue tracker.
