I will, but I ran into #29449 first.

Replying to [comment:6 mjo]:
> What exactly failed?

I see this in the matplotlib log file:

```
                            * The following required packages can not be built:
                            * png
                            * Try installing png with `brew install libpng` and
                            * pkg-config with `brew install pkg-config`
```

and then the build fails.

This looks to me like an issue with Homebrew installing packages in a non-standard location, and then they get mixed up with system packages.

It should be totally indifferent whether it is using Sage's pkgconf (providing pkg-config), or system's pkg-config, they both do exactly the same thing (if not, it's a bug in our management of its PKG_CONFIG_PATH).

No, that's not the correct solution.

If an spkg-configure has more general ways of finding a library than one of the spkgs depending on it, then spkg-configure needs to communicate the install information to that spkg.

you say that reinventing the wheel is the correct solution...

Writing tricky autoconf code, where the user can simply do `brew install pkg-config`, seems to be a waste of time to me.
