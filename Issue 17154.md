[Flagmatic](http://flagmatic.org/) is a downstream project that was reasonably active until the past year or so, and now has a few "friendly forks" to add functionality and/or maintain compatibility with Sage.  We should find out exactly what its status is, and possibly assist in either its incorporation as an optional package, or at least have a little doctesting in some appropriate file so that people know what to expect.

(Note that #14505 added its dependency, csdp, as an optional or experimental package, so that prereq for this is already around.)

Hi, I'm writing a GSoC proposal to incorporate flag algebras (not necessarily Flagmatic) as an optional package in Sage. Any chance that someone would like to supervise (mentor) this? I'd mainly need help with Sage development rules and customs. I understand flag algebras, wrote code implementing them a few times, and modified flagmatic a few times in the past 2 years. Cheers

I would be honoured to mentor such a GSoC project.

Thank you, that's great! I will go on and submit the proposal today. I am not sure how it gets to you or who decides whether it's a good project... I guess we will see.
