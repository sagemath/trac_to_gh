# Issue 22952: The integers embed into their extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23189

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2017-06-09 06:53:13

Keywords: sd86.5

Currently this does not work:

```
sage: CyclotomicField(5).maximal_order().coerce_map_from(ZZ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
```


This probably works if we switch over a `DefaultCoerceMap_unique` to have the right category set.

Is this still relevant?

```
sage: CyclotomicField(5).maximal_order().coerce_map_from(ZZ).is_injective()
True
```
