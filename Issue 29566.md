Is it the new `wheel` package?

pip likes to install via `bdist_wheel` now. Something is getting compiled that was not compiled before. 

I think it reveals that the sagetex code is not compatible with python 3.

Replying to [comment:36 dimpase]:

Good, that should take care of it. I'm surprised that sagetex still works, given these syntax errors.

probably it's from some file that we normally didn't install, or perhaps it was using some compatibility kludge that is now gone.
