CC:  @vbraun @fchapoton @saraedum @slel @kiwifb @dimpase @jhpalmieri

Big upgrade steps, enabled by drop python 2 support.

* https://pypi.org/project/pip/   20.1.1
* https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/  47.1.1
* https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/  4.1.2

Add new packages to satisfy dependencies:

* https://pypi.org/project/wheel/ 0.34.2

These are the latest versions as of 2020-06-05; all claim to support Python >= 3.5 (note #29033)

We adjust `spkg-install` of several packages by removing `pyproject.toml` to remove the need for more extensive build infrastructure. We disable the build of `zope_interface` (no longer needed, see #29754).

Tarballs: See checksums.ini [upstream_url]. (To configure Sage to download from the upstream URL, use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`.)

Previous updates: #26969, #27886, #26008

}
```

Not a big deal, but I'm curious: with `pip`, why only the change to set `versions=3`, instead of removing the loop `for vers in $versions ...` and replacing `$vers` with `3` in `spkg-install.in`?

Is it the new `wheel` package?

pip likes to install via `bdist_wheel` now. Something is getting compiled that was not compiled before. 

I think it reveals that the sagetex code is not compatible with python 3.

Good, that should take care of it. I'm surprised that sagetex still works, given these syntax errors.

probably it's from some file that we normally didn't install, or perhaps it was using some compatibility kludge that is now gone.
