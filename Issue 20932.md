As reported [comment:ticket:20926:60 here]...

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Will most probably vanish with #17635.

(LinBox, FFLAS-FFPACK and Givaro will then *require* C++11, while they currently require `-std=c++98`, i.e., do not support C++11 at all. :-) )


Should we until then add `-std=c++98` in Givaro's `spkg-check` (and probably also `spkg-install`) anyway?

I confirm that since #17635 was merged, givaro test suite (run through `sage -f -c givaro`) passes.
This ticket can be safely closed.

As a wontfix ticket, I guess I can positive review it, even if it has no author.
