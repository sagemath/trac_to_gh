It seems to have a pickling problem with some combinatorial objects (Partitions and others) when trying to return them during parallel computation. 
See the attached file for examples of what raise an error and what doesn't.

Changing keywords from "parallel, fpsac2019" to "parallel, pickling, fpsac2019".

This looks like it working correctly in the latest release:

```
sage: @parallel
....: def some_func_to_parallelize(n):
....:     return Partitions(n).random_element()
....:
sage: for (((_),_), p) in some_func_to_parallelize([n for n in range(2)]):
....:     print(p)
....:
[]
[1]
```
