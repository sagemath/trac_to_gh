Most of the changesets are pretty obviously related to the tickets in question, and I'll put comments there.  Here are a few things which I will put here for archiving which came up in discussion, because a few changesets in Pynac are nonobvious.

You can't check this in the Sage library. The auto generated calls were
something we inherited from GiNaC as a convenience for programming in
C++. Since we use Python, which uses a function call mechanism very
similar to the vector arguments case GiNaC supports, there is no reason
to keep the auto generated functions.

I kept the calls up to 3, since functions implemented in GiNaC use at
least up to 2. I don't know if there is anything which needs 3.

It just deletes some files from the mercurial repository. They are
generated by autoconf. William just imported everything in the GiNaC
distribution tarball when he started working on pynac. This is just
cleaning up some of that cruft.
```

Incidentally, we also note that the conjugate handling change came from upstream.

Update for release manager: positive review for all but #9879 and #9900.  #9879 awaits a review of the reviewer patch (just because it's somewhat long), and #9900 will be positive review once the reviewer creates a reviewer patch, hopefully sometime tomorrow.

Also, although the Pynac website doesn't mention these changes yet, the changesets ARE available [here](http://pynac.sagemath.org/hg/), so it is on the web and not just in Sage :)

I only run at the docsets and everything went fine.
I'll have a look at #9879 and #9900 later.

I just did them in numerical order when I tried them.  Since the ticket #8568 is already closed, I guess that means

* attachment:trac_9394-leading_minus.patch:ticket:9394
* attachment:trac_9878-zeta_infinity.patch:ticket:9878
* attachment:trac_9879-hold.patch:ticket:9879

* attachment:trac_9900_conjugate_doctests-rebase.patch:ticket:9900
* attachment:trac_9900-reviewer.patch:ticket:9900

That order should work.
