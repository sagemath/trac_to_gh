#29025 broke buidling scipy with system's OpenBLAS. I'm now looking into how to tweak  
`numpy/distutils/site.cfg` to make it work, but it is not obvious. Probably there are more bugs there (in numpy).

it's a bloody mess, if you read the numpy issue linked at #29025 - some numpy config functions use `[ALL]` section.

Removing `[DEFAULT]` section allows the build with system OpenBLAS to work again,
so there is clearly something amiss. I messed up while testing #29025 and so it went through.

IMHO all these paths are better set up per library-specific section (`[blas]` etc.)
than via "globals" like `LIBRARY_PATH`.

I'll be honest. None of these failures can be a result of this ticket. May be the git branch needs rebasing to include some fix for those separate issues.

I just downloaded the 9.1.beta2 tarball today, and on an Ubuntu virtual machine it fails on `scipy`, complaining about `blas`:

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

        config = configuration()

        raise NotFoundError(msg)
    numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: No lapack/blas resources found.
```
The main Sage `config.log` file says

```
configure:22549: result:     openblas-0.3.6.p0 will not be installed (configure check)
```
Am I doing something wrong?

No you are not. This ticket is supposed to deal with the stuff you just experienced. But this ticket is not included in 9.1.beta2, so it is effectively broken for external openblas.
