3 is done. Anyone has a better name than `degree_negation` for the algebra automorphism of ``SymmetricFunctions`` which acts as 1 in even degrees and 0 in odd ones?

The changes in the antipode method not only made it work over any rings, but also sped it up on each basis except for the powersum one (and the monomial one, but I improved that with a trivial fix):

Test suite:


```
def testall():
    Sym = SymmetricFunctions(QQ)
    print "m"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).m()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "h"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).h()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "e"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).e()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "s"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
    print "p"
    timeit("SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()([4,3,2]).antipode()")
```


Results:


```
original version:

sage: testall()
m
125 loops, best of 3: 1.86 ms per loop
h
25 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop
e
25 loops, best of 3: 10.8 ms per loop
s
25 loops, best of 3: 30.6 ms per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 146 µs per loop

after change of generic antipode to go via omega rather than via coercion to powersum basis:

sage: testall()
m
125 loops, best of 3: 2.16 ms per loop
h
125 loops, best of 3: 2.92 ms per loop
e
125 loops, best of 3: 2.92 ms per loop
s
625 loops, best of 3: 250 µs per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 148 µs per loop

after microoptimization in the antipode of powersum (replacing (-1)**blah by case distinction):

sage: testall()             
m
125 loops, best of 3: 1.79 ms per loop
h
125 loops, best of 3: 2.88 ms per loop
e
125 loops, best of 3: 2.95 ms per loop
s
625 loops, best of 3: 252 µs per loop
p
625 loops, best of 3: 113 µs per loop

Replying to [comment:9 darij]:
> 1) Is it a good idea to also use cache for e-to-w and w-to-e? (The downside is that there will be more caches in memory.) Same for p-to-w (my current implementation is cacheless, thus not as fast as it could be) and w-to-p.

Only practice will tell, and you'll probably be the one putting this
most to practice; I'd say don't cache for now, and see later if
you need it.

And at some point in the future we would want a mechanism that would
allow the user to specify which caches he want to use for his own
preferred application.

Go ahead. For most classical basis, Symmetrica provides a direct
conversion, and when there is one the coercion system is not as stupid
as using his depth first search :-)

In any case, if something would need to be fixed, it's the coercion
system, not the usage of coercions as above.

Cheers,
                              Nicolas

It's fun how s(w) is quickest with the e-coercion but the advantage disappears when all three coercions are on (because it doesn't know where to go)...

Hey Darij,

Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday. I don't like the phrasing you used (and canonical to me means there is a clear/special reason why this basis is "better" than the others). How about something like

1 - "there is no natural choice for a basis",

2 - "there are multiple natural bases"?

Looking at the arithmetic product (which should go here I think), I have some suggestions:

- The math equation on line 2842, could you set it in a `.. MATH::` block?
- I think the OUTPUT block should be a sentence (it really just needs to be capitalized and have a period).
- Remove the `else` on line 2929 since it makes the code more clear (at least to me since the function ends on the same indent level it started at; and do the de-indent of course).
- Remove some of the comments, in particular the ones describing the variables in the for loops since they are cluttering up the code IMO.

Last, could you fold all of the patches into a single patch? This will make it easier for me to do the final review.

Thank you,

Travis

It seems like there is something special happening for negative numbers / 1 / -1:

```
sage: %timeit (-1)**1000
1000000 loops, best of 3: 993 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**2000                    
100000 loops, best of 3: 968 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**5000
1000000 loops, best of 3: 924 ns per loop
sage: %timeit (-1)**10000
100000 loops, best of 3: 881 ns per loop
```

It probably is doing an if/then via modulus for "large" powers. So having it as `(-1)**x` is faster. Good caveat to know.

I agree that we should avoid doing the sum twice, but it's faster to store it as a variable instead of a lambda function:

```
sage: y = lambda a: 5
sage: %timeit y(2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 770 ns per loop
sage: %timeit x = 5; x
1000000 loops, best of 3: 336 ns per loop
```


Any doc typos are my fault from copy/pasting.

Thanks for the comments Mike.

Either way the time difference is small and tends to hide behind noise (my firefox is running), and I'm not sure whether it is due to the exponentiation itself or to the fact that the former syntax coerces `(-1)**a` into the parent of `x` and then does multiplication within that parent, while the latter only ever uses negation in the parent of `x`.\n\nUploading file now...",

Thanks!

About `(-1)**a * x` vs. `x if a % 2 == 0 else -x`: I've changed it to the former (= more intuitive) syntax now in the Verschiebung method. I was getting a speedup from the latter syntax in a different method (omega or antipode, I don't remember), which made me adapt it as a general tactic. I guess Python is smarter than that, though. Either way the time difference is small and tends to hide behind noise (my firefox is running), and I'm not sure whether it is due to the exponentiation itself or to the fact that the former syntax coerces `(-1)**a` into the parent of `x` and then does multiplication within that parent, while the latter only ever uses negation in the parent of `x`.

Uploading file now...

Done. Someone (Mike? Travis?) should take a look at this as I've been making a lot of manual whitespace changes and who knows whether they're really all whitespace. ;)

The threshhold is easy: anything that is not purely a trailing-whitespace change. Fixing typos is good, rewriting docstrings is good, changing non-trailing whitespace (in a [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant way) is good.
