The `next()` method of a Partition `p` returns the partition that lexicographically follows `p` of the same *size*. We suggest to update the documentation accordingly.


```
sage: Partitions(3)([1,1,1]).next()
False
sage: Partitions()([1,1,1]).next() # One might expect to get [4].
False
sage: PI = iter(Partitions())
sage: [PI.next() for i in range(8)]
[[], [1], [2], [1, 1], [3], [2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [4]]
```
