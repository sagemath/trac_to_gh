# Issue 20415: weird output: show of FiniteField

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20652

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-05-22 09:42:17

Keywords: cloud

We have

```
sage: show(FiniteField(2))
\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}0 1
```

which is the list of elements and not $F_2$.

However, the LaTeX-representation is fine:

```
sage: latex(FiniteField(2))
\Bold{F}_{2}
```


Note that on SMC show behaves differently.
