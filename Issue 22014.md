# Issue 22014: Fix lie_polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22251

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-01-24 18:00:00

We currently have

```sage
sage: F = FreeAlgebra(QQ, 3, 'x,y,z') 
sage: M.<x,y,z> = FreeMonoid(3)
sage: F.lie_polynomial(w)
x*y*z - y*z*x
```

and instead should result in:

```
x*y*z - x*z*y - y*z*x + z*y*x
```

I have just noticed a strange line in the reference file:

```
S\. Murphy, M\. Robshaw
```

could you correct that by passing ?
