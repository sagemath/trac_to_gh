I *think* I know what causes this (an import in sage.matroids.utilities), but I'll do a thorough review of the imports in sage.matroids so this is the last ticket of its kind.

For the record, we started seeing these things when we moved to lazy_import in sage.matroids.all. Before, everything would be imported in a "safe" order at startup. Now it's possible to import things in a different order, and these circular imports are coming to light. It's probably a good thing, I guess.

```
sage: from sage.matroids.linear_matroid import LinearMatroid
