In Python 2, the default implementation of `__format__` implicitly converted the argument to string. In Python 3, one needs to convert explicitly. This was changed because otherwise it would be very difficult to implement `__format__` for an existing class in a backward compatible way because a valid format spec for strings may not be a valid format spec for other classes. See https://bugs.python.org/issue7994. Therefore, implementing a generic `__format__` in `SageObject` by converting to string might not be desirable. Instead, explicitly convert to string:


```
sage: "{!s:5}".format(pi)
'pi   '
sage: "{:5}".format(str(pi))
'pi   '
```


In principle, `__format__` should depend on the type of an object and thus should be implemented for specific classes. For example, I would expect this to work for floating point numbers:


```
sage: "{:.3f}".format(RR(1/3))  # py3
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber.__format__
sage: "{:.3f}".format(RR(1/3))  # py2
...
ValueError: Unknown format code 'f' for object of type 'str'
```

For real numbers, this could be implemented by delegating to `Decimal` which is what [Sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/9aa14250cfcc7b9a62c4c41fa00f90e9f1ce4cfc/sympy/core/numbers.py#L1496) does. For other classes like symbolic expressions, it is less clear what to do.

What's the benefit of doing that over just relying on inheritance and overriding `__format__` to achieve exactly the same? It seems to me it's just less efficient: you need to look further up the inheritance tree to retrieve the first `__format__`, and then you need to look up again to find `_format_`; possibly have an expensive failure (do absences of attribute lookups get cached in python?), and then take action.

I know that indirections like `__add__ -> _add_` are required to have the coercion framework hook in, but I'm less sure that `_repr_` and other similar functions have a need. Before copying that design you'd probably first want to have a good reason why it's required.

In the case of `__repr__` this is to support `.rename()`

Ah good. point. That's a bit of a misfeature in the presence of uniquerepresentation objects, though:


```
sage: M=matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: f=M.charpoly()
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R=ZZ['x'] #this ring is constructed completely independently
sage: R.rename("Arrr")
sage: f.parent() 
Arrr
```


Spooky action at a distance ...

I see, that looks like a problem indeed (though, maybe this is example is not that relevant in practice). See also #27788.
