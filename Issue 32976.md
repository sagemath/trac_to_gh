In many cases, we use `tmp_dir()`, `tmp_filename()` and `SAGE_TMP` where the standard python library functions would be more appropriate. Picking a doctest at random,


```
sage: q = Tachyon()                                                                                                                                              
sage: q.light((1,1,11), 1,(1,1,1))                                                                                                                               
sage: q.texture('s')                                                                                                                                             
sage: q.sphere((0,-1,1),1,'s')                                                                                                                                   
sage: tempname = tmp_filename()                                                                                                                                  
sage: q.save_image(tempname)
```


would be much better off with the last two lines,


```
sage: with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
....:     q.save_image(f.name)
```


That's simpler, cleans up the file immediately, and uses the OS's temporary storage rather than the user's home directory. The last bit can make a big difference when (for example) `/tmp` is mounted in RAM to minimize accesses to a slow disk.

Not important, just something to kill time on a rainy day.

I've posted a work-in-progress branch that raises a question. The python docs,

  https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html

state that, in regards to a named temporary file,

> Whether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary
> file is still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on
> Windows NT or later)

So in many cases, where I would have liked to have done


```
sage: with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
....:     q.save_image(f.name)
```


I have instead done something like


```
sage: f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False); f.close()
sage: q.save_image(f.name)
sage: os.remove(f.name)
```


or


```
sage: with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
....:     filename = os.path.join(d, "foo.png") 
....:     q.save_image(filename)
```


to avoid the `save_image` call reopening the same name. However, the docs are unclear about what "on Windows" means. So the two examples above can be simplified if this is not a problem on cygwin.

How did you solve the problems that sage-cleaner solves?  It's not like I wrote it for no reason.  There are many situations in practice that people hit where temp files and subprocess get left around.  Make sure that at least the following works:

1. Start sage.  Do something that creates a temp file and also something that spawns a subprocess.
2. Segfault the sage that you started, e.g., by doing something stupid with Cython.

What happens?  Are all temp files and spawned processes properly cleaned up?

It's an unfortunate reality that we make Cython relatively easy to use, hence it's easy from the command line or notebook to segfault a running Sage process.

1. Now that all temporary files are created in `/tmp` or equivalent, they'll be cleaned up by the system eventually. In the event of a crash, I would say that this is preferable, because those temporary files can contain important debugging information.

2. Sage doesn't segfault. More seriously, it depends on the process. In the simplest case, the subprocess will continue doing whatever it's doing until it completes, and will then terminate. Next would be subprocesses that communicate with the parent; eventually they'll be sent a SIGPIPE and commit suicide. If you go out of your way to launch something that is basically a daemon, though, it can indeed outlive the parent.

For (2) to be an issue, you have to launch a standalone process that never terminates, detach it from the parent, compile a C extension, load the extension into your current session, and then cause it to segfault. I don't think cleaning up after that situation should be the responsibility of *any* application; but especially not of a computer algebra system.

If you intend to do something like that frequently (or host a service for users who will...), there are better solutions these days -- cgroups on linux being the best example. Keeping in mind that sage-cleaner works by parsing a `spawned_processes` file that must be updated every time a process is launched, solving the problem at the OS level in particular has the advantage that it will catch sub-subprocesses. Sage-cleaner generally cannot (unless the subprocess is also sage), because the subprocess doesn't know that it's supposed to add a line item to `spawned_processes`.

Thanks `@`mjo for your explanation.   Your responses don't necessarily apply in the context of users that got me to write the sage-cleaner in the first place, and they will probably be pretty annoyed if they ever realize what happened.

Fortunately, over the years the number of subprocesses Sage spawns has been reduced due to writing and using C library interfaces instead of pexpect, etc.

Regarding /tmp, unless you specifically set something up to periodically clean up files, unless things have changed a lot, don't most Linux distros *not* automatically delete files from there, possibly until a reboot?  You're making a huge change from "temp files get cleaned up by Sage itself quickly" to "maybe someday the system will clean them up".

You're making a huge change from "temp files get cleaned up by Sage itself quickly" to "maybe someday the system will clean them up".

Systemd comes with a timer (like a cron job) to clean up `/tmp`, but I'm not familiar with its out-of-the-box configuration on mainstream distros. I still use OpenRC myself, where a reboot is what triggers it.

On systems like mine, "leftover junk" is a fair criticism, but keep in mind the bigger picture: the python `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` and `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()` functions *automatically remove the file/directory as soon as it's done being used.*  In this branch, I've changed a bunch of manual `SAGE_TMP` code to use those two functions, so a lot of what would have been leftover junk is now simply not created in the first place. Any remaining junk is due to sage's own `tmp_filename()` and `tmp_dir()`, which expect you to clean up the file yourself, or assume that sage-cleaner will do it eventually.

If this gets merged, we can deprecate `tmp_filename()` and `tmp_dir()` as obsolete in favor of the python functions. Over a hopefully-short amount of time, that should eliminate the leftover junk at the source.

It doesn't really delete anything except the files created specifically for the benefit of sage-cleaner, and some legacy paths whose locations were changed in the `fix_old_mistakes()` funtion.

I'm not strongly opposed to leaving sage-cleaner alone, but a deprecation warning on killed processes is going to produce false positives on every process that would have terminated nicely but was killed prematurely by sage-cleaner, i.e. most of them.

>>> import tempfile
>>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".txt") as f:
...     with open(f.name, "w") as g:

In many cases, the point of the method is that it writes what would normally be shown to the user to a file instead. If you want to see this MILP, for example, then `p.show()` can be used instead. I'm dodging your point, but looking back, many of these tests are in the same spirit.

In general, I would say it's bad practice to give users code that will write to a temporary file and teach them to expect it to remain there. It's better to have these copy/paste examples fail immediately, so that the user will pick a non-temporary path for his own experiments.
