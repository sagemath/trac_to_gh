Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: associahedra

The patch contains the implementation of the generalized associahedron, as constructed in Chapoton, Fomin, Zelevinsky - Polytopal realizations of the generalized associahedra, http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0202004.


```
sage: Associahedron(['A',3])
Generalized associahedron of type ['A', 3] with 14 vertices
```


The class inherits from Polyhedra, and uses several new methods for root spaces.

I wouldn't know how to fix that in this patch actually.

What about:

```
    sage: sorted(Asso.Hrepresentation(), key=repr)
    [An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0, An inequality (1, 1) x + 1 >= 0]
```


Then the result should be sorted according to their string
representation, and string comparison should be platform independent.

Done - how can I know that string representations should be platform independent and some others aren't?

Thanks! Christian

Thanks! Positive review, assuming the tests pass.

> how can I know that string representations should be platform independent and some others aren't?

Because:

- I am amost certain that Python compares strings lexicographically (it does for e.g. tuples; see http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html; it's certainly specified somewhere for strings too)
- The Inequality class implements _repr_ independently of the platform
- On the other hand, this class does not implement __cmp__, so its behavior is unspecified. And likely to be platform dependent.

The buildbot somehow doesn't like the test


```
for root in L.almost_positive_roots():
         print 'tau({:<41}) ='.format(root), tau(root)
```


I guess, you added it, didn't you? On my 5.0.beta6, it passed though.

Best, Christian

Indeed.

Python has been upgraded to 2.7 in Sage 5.0. I guess this syntax for format was not yet supported in Python 2.6. Let's just wait for the buildbot to run on 5.0.
