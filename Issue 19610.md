Calling `direct_sum()` can produce the following:


```
/home/mjo/src/sage.git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module.pyc in direct_sum(self, other)
   1327             raise TypeError("other must be a free module")
   1328         if other.base_ring() != self.base_ring():
-> 1329             raise TypeError("base rins of self and other must be the same")
   1330         return self.basis_matrix().block_sum(other.basis_matrix()).row_module(self.base_ring())
   1331 

TypeError: base rins of self and other must be the same
```


In the error, "rins" should be "rings".
