I have in local/lib64:

```
libec.a         libgap.so        libgf2x.so.1      liblrcalc.so.0.0.0  libmpc.so.3
libec.la        libgap.so.0      libgf2x.so.1.0.0  liblrcalc.so.1      libmpc.so.3.0.0
libec.so        libgap.so.0.0.0  liblrcalc.a       liblrcalc.so.1.0.0
libec.so.0      libgf2x.a        liblrcalc.la      libmpc.a
libec.so.0.0.0  libgf2x.la       liblrcalc.so      libmpc.la
libgap.la       libgf2x.so       liblrcalc.so.0    libmpc.so

-rwxr-xr-x 1 ralf users     983 Jul 29 14:49 local/lib64/libgap.la*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ralf users      15 Jul  1 11:00 local/lib64/libgap.so -> libgap.so.0.0.0*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ralf users      15 Jul  1 11:00 local/lib64/libgap.so.0 -> libgap.so.0.0.0*
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ralf users 3262386 Jul  1 11:00 local/lib64/libgap.so.0.0.0*

(sage-sh) ralf@ark:sage$ set|grep LD_
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/ralf/sage/local/lib:/home/ralf/sage/local/lib64:/home/ralf/sage/local/lib/R/lib
```

System is OpenSuSE 12.3.
I also have `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/libgap.so` but I don't think that's relevant here? These are the only files with name `libgap.so*`



For completeness, when I take back commit 02a25d5626c0527e81559d3229ac6b6f64d35978 every complaint made goes away.

Fixed to not depend directly on the libdir (only indirectly through cythonize -> extension module timestamp)

Doctests in `graphs/` pass now, and the documentation gets built. Do we need a ptestlong?

I'll run it on the buildbot and then make a beta8 since this is bound to affect many users.
