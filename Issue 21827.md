At the moment, `subs` of a (multivariate) laurent polynomial implements its own subs, whereas polynomials, etc. use the more efficient `__call__` for doing so.

The provided branch implements using __call__ and it is indeed more efficient: much less evaluation time is needed, in particular when having laurent polynomials with many terms.

The (minor) drawback

```
sage: L.<a,b> = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: (b^2/a + b/a^2).subs({a: SR('aa'), b: SR('bb')})
(aa*bb^2 + bb)/aa^2
```

There is a failing doctest detected by the patchbot.
Why is the status "needs_info"?
