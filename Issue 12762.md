Some components of Sage, e.g., libsingular, link in the systemwide libtermcap.so dynamically instead of statically linking the libtermcap.a that is built by the Sage termcap spkg.  This is a *big problem* when building a binary on a system that has libtermcap.so and trying to run it on another system that does not have that so.

Solution?: Modifying the spkg-install script for termcap so it also builds the so libraries. 

* See also #12725, which changes the termcap spkg...   T

The version of termcap in Sage (i.e. the official upstream version) does not support building shared libraries.  So, I am a bit surprised to see the file `libtermcap.so` appear on your system.  Could you try whether the spkg from #12725 fixes the problem?  i.e. build termcap from #12725 and then rebuild Singular and check whether `local/lib/libsingular.so` still links against `libtermcap.so`
