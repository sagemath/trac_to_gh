```
G=SL(2,ZZ)
identity = matrix(ZZ, [[1,0], [0,1]])
G.cayley_table(names='elements',elements=[identity, -identity])
```

From [this ask.sagemath.org](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/383/badly-formatted-cayley-table) question.  Essentially, matrix groups don't seem to work out too well:

```

sage: G.cayley_table(names='elements',elements=[identity, -identity])
              *      [1 0]
[0 1] [-1  0]
[ 0 -1]
               +--------------------------------
    [1 0]
[0 1]|     [1 0]
[0 1] [-1  0]
[ 0 -1]
[-1  0]
[ 0 -1]| [-1  0]
[ 0 -1]     [1 0]
[0 1]
```
