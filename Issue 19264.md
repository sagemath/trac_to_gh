```
print 1000000000000000000.factor(algorithm='foobar')
print 10000000000000000000.factor(algorithm='foobar')
```


outputs


```
2^18 * 5^18
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
ValueError: Algorithm is not known
```


Also indentation is wrong in proof-keyword.

This gives three errors:


```
File "src/sage/tests/cmdline.py", line 106, in sage.tests.cmdline.test_executable
Failed example:
    out.find(version()) >= 0
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```


I suppose those do not relate to this patch and so mark this as needs_review.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Frédéric? This is a trivial fix, but I don't know who to ask for a review.

* I do not like `assert False` ; simply remove the else clause instead

* correct the indentation also in the INPUT 'limit' paragraph

* put the `raise ArithmeticError, "text"` into the new format `ArithmeticError("text")` also

Done.

Done. And grepped: there is 1480 old-style `raise`s left. Want to review next massive trivial change?

> * correct the indentation also in the INPUT 'limit' paragraph

Done. (But it was not that bad, because Sphinx was able to parse it right.)

ok, positive review.

Please refrain from opening a ticket for correction of raise syntax. They should all be in cython files, by the way.

Thanks. According to

`egrep 'raise [a-zA-Z]+Error, ' -R src/sage -l | cut -f 2 -d . | sort | uniq -c` there are 36 in .py -files.
