We already override the built-in `help()` function from Python with our own that prints some useful help text when it's called without arguments.

However, when called with arguments like `help(Integer)` it just uses the default Python `help()` implementation, and not the help provided through the IPython `<obj>?` syntax.

That said, `help(<obj>)` is sometimes more informative as it lists all the methods on an object and their docstrings as well (sometimes this is _too_ informative if you just want a summary of methods).  Whereas `<obj>?` typically just lists the docstring of the object's class, but not documentation for methods or attributes.

Meanwhile `<obj>??` is almost always too much.  It displays the full source code of the object's class, which is great when you want to see it, but too much information for general help purposes.

From a UX perspective I believe there's no reason `help(<obj>)` and `<obj>?` should do different things.  As it is it's more than one way to do a thing, and it shouldn't have different results--the user is force to remember which syntax they want to use to get different levels of information, and there's no obvious reason for the present distinction.

So I would be for merging the functionality of `help(<obj>)` and `<obj>?`--make them do the same thing, and also make whatever it is they do informative.
