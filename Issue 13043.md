# Issue 13043: Skew polynomials

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: skew polynomials

If R is a ring equipped with an endomorphism sigma, the ring of skew polynomials over (R,sigma) is the ring of usual polynomials over R with the modified multiplication given by the rule X*a = sigma(a)*X.

Skew polynomials play an important role in several domains like coding theory or Galois representations theory in positive characteristic.

The attached patch provides:

1. a basic implementation of skew polynomials over any commutative ring (including addition, multiplication, euclidean division, gcd...)
1. a more complete implementation of skew polynomials over finite fields (including factoring)

With your changes it is now possible to test some element in an Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring to be a unit and to compute its inverse. Unfortunately, this computation gives wrong results:


```
sage: Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[]
sage: GR.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x**2 + x+1 )
sage: (2*y).is_unit()
True
sage: (2*y)^(-1)
15*y + 15
sage: (2*y)*(2*y)^(-1)
2
```

Thanks for catching this!

I've updated my patch. (I've simply decided to raise a NotImplementedError when the base ring is not a field and, by the way, I've added some doctests.)

PS: apply patch trac_13215_skew_polynomials.patch and forget trac_13215_skew_polynomials.2.patch (is it possible to remove it?)

Maybe you should produce a seperate trac ticket for the fix of 

```
sage: (2*y)^(-1)
...
NotImplementedError: The base ring (=Ring of integers modulo 16) is not a field
```


By the way, I know that this is a problem which also occurs for usual polynomials (because of the default definition of the reduce function). Do you have any idea how to fix this:


```
sage: Z16x.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(Integers(16)) 
sage: # Z16x.<x> = Integers(16)[] # has the same behaviour
sage: GR.<y> =  Z16x.quotient(x**2 + x+1 )
sage: I = GR.ideal(4)
sage: I.reduce(6)
6
```

Ok, I split my patch in two parts and I open a new ticket (cf #13303).

I'm afraid I don't understand quite well the problem with reduce. Could you explain it a bit more please?

Hi Xavier,

you are right this is a more general problem. I started a discussion on
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/s5y604ZPiQ8/discussion.
The function reduce() does what it says _returning an element of the ring_.
But in the definition of a QuotientRing there is the following assumption
    `I.reduce(x)==I.reduce(y) \iff x-y \in I`, and
    `x-I.reduce(x) \in I`, for all `x \in R`.
With this default behaviour, the quotient ring is just a copy of the original ring R. 

Best, Thomas

It would be great to have all this in Sage. Thanks a lot for your work.

I haven't had a chance to look at the patches yet. I will try to make some time available for this in the coming weeks. For now, I have two questions,

 * Did you consider using Singular's noncommutative component, Plural, as a basic data structure for skew polynomials? I expect the arithmetic to be much faster with Plural than a new implementation in Cython.
 * Can the patches be broken down into smaller components for easier review?


---

Comment by caruso created at 2012-08-28 19:34:31

I haven't heard about Plural before that... so, I haven't considered using it for skew polynomials yet. I will compare how fast is the arithmetic with Plural and with my own implementation in Cython and let you know.

Ok, I will split my patch in several components. (Is two enough or are you expecting more than that?).

Thanks for the prompt response! I am attending a workshop this week and I haven't had a chance to read through your patch properly yet. So please excuse me if I am completely off the mark in my response below. :)

Replying to [comment:15 caruso]:
> I haven't heard about Plural before that... so, I haven't considered using it for skew polynomials yet. I will compare how fast is the arithmetic with Plural and with my own implementation in Cython and let you know.

Your patch provides more functionality than Plural, for example gcd's and factoring. The coefficient domains supported by Plural are also limited. I suppose your implementation supports more general coefficient domains, basically anything Sage already knows about.

It would be good to have a clear comparison between Plural and your implementation first. But I imagine having two skew polynomial classes in Sage, a generic implementation from your patch and one based on Plural. We could probably share the high level functionality not provided by Plural using the category framework. 

I am not opposed to just including your patch and think about the Plural part later as an optimization if you say that your implementation is more capable.

> Ok, I will split my patch in several components. (Is two enough or are you expecting more than that?).

I don't know yet. It depends on how many functionally independent parts there are. For instance, the short representations for morphisms can be an independent piece that is trivial to review.  The hash functions for morphisms would also be a separate bug fix. Actually, I attempted to fix that a long time ago at #9016.

Comment by caruso created at 2012-08-29 12:23:06

I had a quick look at the documentation of Plural but I didn't find how to create a skew polynomial ring (i.e. I don't know how to represent a skew polynomial ring as a G-algebra). Could you please learn me this?

The hash functions for morphisms would also be a separate bug fix. Actually, I attempted to fix that a long time ago at #9016.

From a cursory reading of attachment:trac_13215_skew_polynomials.patch, I see these separate parts that should have a ticket of its own:

 - short representations for morphisms
 - hash functions for morphisms (#9016)
 - q_jordan
 - modular exponentiation of polynomial_element

A few comments (not a full review):

 - the operator `/` always constructs the quotient domain in Sage, even if exact division is possible. Since in this case we need a generic Ore localization for `/`, I suggest you only implement exact division with `//` and raise an error on `/`.
 {{{
+    sage: d = a * b
+    sage: d/b == a   # Right division
+    True
+
+    sage: c/b
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    ValueError: the division is not exact
 }}}

 - For the constructor, why don't you check if the argument of the `__getitem__` method is a `Morphism` instead of this:
 {{{
       from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
        if isinstance(x,tuple) and len(x) == 2 and isinstance(x[1],Morphism):
 }}}
 This should remove the limitation of having to specify the variable name on the right hand side as documented here:
 {{{
+One can also use a shorter syntax::
+
+    sage: S.<x> = R['x',sigma]; S
+    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring twisted by t |--> t + 1
+
+Be careful, with the latter syntax, one cannot omit the name of the 
+variable neither in LHS nor in RHS. If we omit it in LHS, the variable 
+is not created::
+
+    sage: Sy = R['y',sigma]; Sy
+    Skew Polynomial Ring in y over Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring twisted by t |--> t + 1
+    sage: y.parent()
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    NameError: name 'y' is not defined    
+
+If we omit it in RHS, sage tries to create a polynomial ring and fails::
+
+    sage: Sz.<z> = R[sigma]
+    Traceback (most recent call last):
+    ...
+    ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is 'Ring endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring
+      Defn: t |--> t + 1' which is not.
}}}

 - There is a class `SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field` defined in `sage/rings/polynomial/skewpolynomial_ring.py`. There is also a file `sage/rings/polynomial/skewpolynomial_finite_field.pyx`. It seems that the class defined in the latter does not use the latter:
 {{{
cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense (SkewPolynomial_generic_dense):
}}}

 - I suggest using `skew_polynomial` in the file names instead of `skewpolynomial`.

 - Are the `Left` and `Right` objects defined in `sage/structure/side.py` really necessary? If `Right` is the default, can't you just have a keyword argument `left=<bool>`?

 - There are many functions missing a docstring or tests. Here is partial coverage output:

Here is some more information from Viktor Levandovskyy about Plural and skew polynomials rings over finite fields with the frobenius map.


```
> Plural can be used in the following situations:
> Let |F|=p^k, where p is a prime.
> *) always possible: k = 1,2 and k = p-1,p.
> *) For k=3,...,p-2 there's no general statement, sometimes
> works, sometimes not. Depends on p and k
> *) k>p: impossible (with Plural)
```

Ok, I've done it (see tickets #13640, #13641 #13642 and old ticket #13214 for "hash functions for morphisms").

> After applying the patches on this ticket and its dependencies, I get the following error:

It's now fixed. (I haven't really understood what was the problem. It worked well on sage 5.1.0. I just removed some `inline` somewhere.)

>  - the operator `/` always constructs the quotient domain in Sage, even if exact division is possible. Since in this case we need a generic Ore localization for `/`, I suggest you only implement exact division with `//` and raise an error on `/`.

Done.

>  - For the constructor, why don't you check if the argument of the `__getitem__` method is a `Morphism` instead of this:
>  {{{

It's not possible to remove this limitation this way because of the preparser (you see in the following example that the variable 'x' doesn't appear in the first instruction on the last line).


```
sage: k.<t> = GF(5^3)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: preparse(S.<x> = k[Frob])
sage: preparse("S.<x> = k[Frob]")
'S = k[Frob]; (x,) = S._first_ngens(1)'
```


>  - I suggest using `skew_polynomial` in the file names instead of `skewpolynomial`.

Done.

>  - Are the `Left` and `Right` objects defined in `sage/structure/side.py` really necessary? If `Right` is the default, can't you just have a keyword argument `left=<bool>`?

Sometimes, `Left` is the default (for lcm). I agree that we can just have a boolean argument but, when I wrote this code, I thought that it was more elegant to do this way. Anymay, I can change if you insist :-).

>  - There are many functions missing a docstring or tests.

I've added some documentation and doctests (but I'm still far from a 100% coverage).

Needs to be rebased on sage-5.12beta5. The patch fails to apply to sage/structure/all.py.

I'd do it myself but when I try to open the file in gedit, I get:
"The file you opened has some invalid characters. If you continue editing this file you could corrupt this document.
You can also choose another character encoding and try again."
Might be some accents or umlauts on names.

A little thing I noted: `is_SkewPolynomial` should be removed, I think. Sage
moved away from that kind of functions. The category framework should be used
instead, but I don't think we need to find a replacement for it just now.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-06-24 15:46:57

A better idiom is to just use `isinstance(S, SkewPolynomialRing_general)` as it is explicit (and there is no category for skew polynomial rings).


---

Comment by jsrn created at 2016-07-09 18:07:19

One of the bugs in the doctest has to do with failing in the proper manner when the twist map is not invertible (this is the `TypeError: bad operand type for unary ~` bug). This is because `self._map ** n` is being called with negative `n`, which will then try to invert `self._map` using the unary `~` operator which is not supported by `self._map` of type `Homomorphism_im_gens`.

But the code was always supposed to fail! The doc-test just expected the error NotImplementedError, while the error nowadays is this unhelpful unary-~-stuff. 

One solution is therefore simply to catch the strange error and rethrow a NotImplementedException. The following patch should be put in `skew_polynomial_ring.py` (the line numbers are not completely correct):


```
`@``@` -534,9 +534,18 `@``@` class SkewPolynomialRing_general(sage.algebras.algebra.Algebra,UniqueRepresentat
         try:
             return self._maps[n]
         except KeyError:
-            map = self._map**n
-            self._maps[n] = map
-            return map
+            if n >= 0:
+                map = self._map**n
+                self._maps[n] = map
+                return map
+            else:
+                try:
+                    map = self._map**n
+                except TypeError:
+                    raise NotImplementedError("Inversion of the twist map %s" % self._map)
+                self._maps[n] = map
+                return map
+                    
```

Johan

The current ticket now contains only the basic framework for skew polynomials. All features related to finite fields, irreducibility, center and karatsuba multiplication will be put into a separate ticket. The aim is to fix the failed doctests in the `skew_polynomial_element.pyx` file and then refactor the code, improve/add documentation and tests, phase out "side".

We planned on breaking up this skew polynomials ticket into five pieces namely:
1. Ticket A - The main framework. Skew polynomials, basic operations, coercions, skew polynomial rings, etc.
2. Ticket B - Class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_dense, class SkewPolynomialRing_finite_field and related methods
3. Ticket C - cdef class SkewPolynomial_finite_field_karatsuba and related methods
4. Ticket D - class SectionSkewPolynomialCenterInjection, class SkewPolynomialCenterInjection, class CenterSkewPolynomialRing and related methods
5. Ticket E - Irreducibility and Factoring related methods.

The current ticket #13215 has been modified to cover Ticket A. I will post an update here with the links to the remaining tickets once they have been created. For now, based on discussions, the main framework has been refactored, appended to, edited, documented and tested. I'm now opening this ticket for review.

Hello,

I started reviewing your work. For now, I mostly read documentation and checked
formatting, without focusing on the code itself. 
Here are my comments:

## Generic comments:

- For now, there's nothing related to skew polynomials in the index file, so it won't be possible
 for the user to access the documentation through the online reference manual.
 Can you please add a dedicated section in the related index file? See `src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings/index.rst`.

- I would also use the experimental decorator here: the code in itself seems stable, but it
 will allow us to make later name changes (for instance) without putting deprecation warnings
 all over the place. In particular, I have in mind later implementations of sparse rings and
 multivariate rings, which might trigger some renaming in the classes implemented here.

## skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py

- I might be wrong, but it does not seem to have any reason to get both input `name` and `names`.
 The argument in the `NOTE` block sounds weird to me, especially when reading the code: it seems
 to be some kind of argument for later enhancements (multivariate skew polynomial rings), as for now
 it does not work if the list contains more than one element. Furthermore, the input `names` is
 only used to set `name` if the latter is `None`, and dropped just after.
 And in any case, I think it's better to use only one input and use type checks.
 I propose to remove `names`, rename `name` into `variable_names`, and use sanity checks: if it's 
 a string, or a list with a single string, use it, otherwise return an appropriate error.
 I also suggest to add a line in the note block to say that multivariate rings are not
 supported (it's only detailed in tests for now).
- Can you please explicit what `LHS`/`RHS` means?
- There's an option `sparse=False` which, if set to `True`, returns a `NotImplementedError`.
 I suggest to remove it for now in order to not confuse the user, and reinstate it later
 when it will be fully implemented. In this case, also remove all references to this feature
 in the documentation.
- `INPUT` block could be enhanced: I would rather explain what's `name` (or `variable_names` if
 you agree with my comment above) instead of just saying "a string". I would also rename `sigma`
 to something more indicative. What about `base_ring_endomorphism`?
- As I suggest to remove some not implemented but planned features, it might be a good
 idea to add a `TODO` block as a reminder of these features (sparse rings, multivariate rings).
- Module title says "constructorS for skew polynomial rings", while there's only one method
 in this module. `</quibbling>`
- Module documentation itself is not great. I think it might be a good idea to add a few
 links to `skew_polynomial_ring.py`, and even to give a small definition of a skew polynomial ring
 in this module.

## skew_polynomial_ring.py

- The short description of this module:
 "Sage implements dense skew univariate polynomials over commutative rings.",
 seems unhelpful. I'd rather replace it by something explaining the purpose of this
 module.
- I think the definition can be enhanced a bit: for instance, you find references to "twisting"
 all over the examples, but it's not defined everywhere. Reading what's in the `DEFINITION` block
 should be enough to understand the terminology used in the module, even if you're not familiar with
 skew polynomials at all.
- Same remark as above regarding `LHS`/`RHS`.
- Some imports are not necessary anymore, e.g. `import sage.misc.latex as latex`.
- Some methods here do not follow the mandatory documentation template.
 For instance, `__init__` does not have a short description, nor an `INPUT` block...
- There are a few methods in this file which are commented. If these are no longer useful,
 I suggest to remove them instead of commeting them.
- In some methods, documentation is not really helpful: see `twist_map` for instance. 
 If says "Return the twist map [...]" which is not very informative... 
- While I'm talking about it, would it be possible to explain why this method might fail
 if you pass a negative number as input? The sentence "Sometimes it succeeds" seems to imply
 it's more or less random, but if you could investigate this a bit it would lead to a more
 satisfying documentation.

## skew_polynomial_element.py

- Same remark as above regarding the definition of a skew polynomial ring.
- Same remark as above regarding imported packages.
- Same remark as above regarding informativeness of docstrings for some methods.
- Same remark as above regarding documentation itself: a few methods (e.g. `conjugate`) do
 not have a short description, while `make_generic_skew_polynomial` does not have documentation at all!

Best,

David

It is okay to change class names as long as the public API doesn't change (although this can entail unpickling issues in either case). I would instead future-proof this by

I think these are such common abbreviations for Left(Right)-Hand Side that being explicit about them will add some clutter.

I disagree with these comments. This is documenting an upcoming feature, it helps keeps the API consistent with future plans and other parts of Sage, and tells someone reading the code what is currently not implemented.

> - Some methods here do not follow the mandatory documentation template.
>  For instance, `__init__` does not have a short description, nor an `INPUT` block...

I treat this more as a strong guideline than a hard rule, but with that being said, anything more non-trivial should at least document its inputs (e.g., the `__init__` would be useful).

I agree with the rest of David's comments.

Also, from a cursory glance, there seems to be a lot of duplication with the current implementations of polynomials (i.e., the elements). I feel there could be a lot of simplification of the code by either subclassing or creating a mix-in (cython) class that overrides the `_mul_` of polynomials. Is there a reason why you didn't do this? This might entail doing some refactoring/abstracting of the polynomial code though, but it should make the implementation of skew polynomials a lot easier (and bug proof).

I read up a little on Sphinx documentation and from what I understand, I need to add the following in the file you mentioned, right?


```
`@`sage.misc.superseded.experimental(trac_number=13215)
Skew Polynomials

Placing the experimental warning (like I did above) is not the right way to do it because it does not throw an error. Do I instead place this line at the start of every class in all the three files instead?

I agree. `names` and `name` are both not required and `variable_names` along with tests to check type of the input is cleaner. I've made this change.

Like `@`tscrim mentions, I think LHS/RHS are extremely common terms that are used almost everywhere and perhaps don't need explicit description.

There are a lot of places where a NotImplementedError is raised and not just in this ticket but in other polynomial files as well. I think it makes more sense to have them if they are already there. However, there is then the inconsistency in that derivations in skew polynomials are not implemented and are marked as `todo` as is the multivariate case in some places. Still, I argue for keeping sparse as it is since it is integrated in the framework already unlike the other two. And with the experimental warning showing up, changing this will not create too much trouble.

An endomorphism that admits an inverse is an automorphism and skew polynomial rings AFAIK are based on automorphisms. Please correct me if I'm mistaken in this. If so, the places where it says that the twist map is not invertible, maybe should say that twist map should be invertible. And accordingly, the name can be changed to `base_ring_automorphism`.

Understood. I've made changes and expanded on the definitions and examples from other files. Same goes for all other notes (below) about improving explanations. 

> - Some imports are not necessary anymore, e.g. `import sage.misc.latex as latex`.
I tried to do that with the ones I thought were not needed/deprecated. I've obviously missed a few. I'll go over this once again.

Is there a reference doc or something where I can go through the mandatory documentation template? Or is it that Description, Input, Output, Examples, Tests - should these be present for every method? A lot of places, it doesn't make sense to have all of this.

> - In some methods, documentation is not really helpful: see `twist_map` for instance.

Oh right! I mentioned this in the email thread with Johan except that I somehow messed up the name. I wasn't sure of what this method was doing.

Yup! I you're not sure of what you're doing, here's a way to test it:
run `sage --docbuild src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings html`, it will compile the 
doc and give you an address. Copy-paste this address in your browser, and click on "index"
in the page which opens. If what you added in `index.rst` works, you should see it here (and
you'll be able to check its formatting as well).

Mmh, I reconsidered my position on this thanks to Travis' comment: as we'll not change the public API (which is the method in `skew_polynomial_ring_constructor.py`), I don't think it's necessary to
put experimental warnings everywhere, as long as we're future proof as Travis suggests.
\\\\

Yes, you're both right, let's drop that and keep `LHS`/`RHS`.

Yes, thinking again about it, I think you're both right. It's better to be future proof, and if
it's used elsewhere in `polynomials`, there's definitely no trouble in doing so.

Err, yes my bad. `base_ring_automorphism` sounds good `:)`

Don't worry, it's quite tricky.

You can read this [tutorial](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) for Sage developers.
But I agree this is not strong rules: while I do follow the "short description, jump line, optional
long description" for my methods, I only write an `OUTPUT` block when the output is not obvious from reading the short description. I always write an `INPUT` block when there's input arguments, as I
think that even if the names of the input arguments seems obvious, it's always nice to have an
explicit definition. `EXAMPLES` are of course mandatory. `TESTS` are not, I think you should only 
use them when you want to run a few more tests which do not really make sense for the user. For instance, I use `TESTS` to doctest sanity checks. It's nice to add a doctest to ensure everything is
sanitized, but it's of little interest for the user.

Oh ok! I'll read it and try to understand what it does.

That command you mentioned didn't work. I get the following error message.


```
'src/doc/en/reference/polynomial_rings' is not a recognized document. Type 'sage --docbuild -D' for a list
of documents, or 'sage --docbuild --help' for more help.

```


I've made the other changes according to the discussions above.

This is debatable: sparse skew polynomials are not very useful whenever there is a derivation (since sparsity is not retained well across operations), and it's not very clear what a multivariate skew ring is. The most natural generalisation of this structure is Ore polynomials, but that would likely be a separate class. I don't think it makes sense to leave implementation artifacts that will, most likely, never lead to real implementations. In the odd case that they *would* lead to implementations, we could reinstate them with no penalty.

> Also, from a cursory glance, there seems to be a lot of duplication with the current implementations of polynomials (i.e., the elements).

That's arguably true. To be fair: Xavier Caruso made the code, and Arpit just tried to get it into shape with less than full-rewrite-workload. That said, I would be concerned about subclassing commutative classes that commutative-only code creeps into the skew polynomials: for instance if someone later on adds a method to the parent class and forgets to explicitly overwrite or remove this method in the skew polynomial class. It's really only all the basics that are shared btw commutative/non-commutative: all the substantial and complex properties are not shared at all.

Oh, I just remembered that this patch doesn't provide skew polynomials with derivations :-D So then this comment might be somewhat moot ;-)

One would perhaps add skew polynomials with derivations before full-fledged Ore rings, though :-)

That must of gotten lost when I had connectivity issues. This was suppose to be "by using a consistent API".

I thank them both for working on this and pushing it forward.

I don't want to diminish their work, but sometimes after having the code there and looking ahead, major refactoring can be needed. However, there would likely need to be refactoring of the usual commutative polynomials to address the issue you brought up. There could also be ways to factor out common code from other algebras across Sage. So in short, what I'm suggesting is to have a common abstract base class for both for the basic/core functionality. If there is only a little overlap (I really haven't looked), then we can just continue in our current fashion.

Ah ok. You're right: aim for a good API. I think that the experimental decorator is still a good idea for such a big, brand-new feature, though. That what it was introduced for.

I agree that this would be nice and should be looked at. However, can I suggest
that this is for another ticket (cf. Reviewer's Checklist ["The perfect is the enemy of the good"][http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/reviewer_checklist.html)).

That way, improvements could progress on both ends (improving code sharing between the polynomial types, while improving skew poly functionality, and the coding theory constructions that we will build using skew polynomials).

In this case we have very similar features that we have had for a long time, in addition to a certain amount of stability with the code. By that, I think we shouldn't scare users with such a warning.

I'm not asking for perfection. If we do decide to subclass, then it just makes it somewhat harder to refactor once this is included. Just to be clear, I am just raising the question, not making the refactoring a requirement.

> That way, improvements could progress on both ends (improving code sharing between the polynomial types, while improving skew poly functionality, and the coding theory constructions that we will build using skew polynomials).

If only I had time... :P

Oh, my mistake, `sage --docbuild reference/polynomial_rings html` is enough... By the way, don't forget to rebuild before compiling documentation. If you don't, changes you made to the docstrings/tests since your last rebuild will not be considered.

Hi David,

The `name` and `names` that we had agreed upon changing to `variable_names` is giving a problem I did not notice until I was testing stuff today. I think the reason they exist is not just to facilitate multi-variate rings but also to support the diamond bracket notation. `S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(R, sigma)` and without it gives TypeError (unexpected keyword argument). Also, this is a syntax present in other ring constructors in Sage. And while we don't support multivariate rings for Skew Polynomials, perhaps this feature might be added later on and we do need the diamond notation. Is there an alternate way in Sage to capture the diamond bracket or should we revert back to the original?

Hello,

Oh, ok I was not aware of that. I tested it on my side, and indeed whenever you use diamond bracket, it expects an argument called `names`. 
Xavier's comments on the `NOTE` block makes sense now.

In that case, what about removing the argument `name` and keep only `names`?
Then, through input sanitization, allow only string, list containing one string, fail with a specific error if one passes a list with several strings in it explaining multivariate ring is not yet supported, and fail with a generic error message, e.g. "You can only pass a string, or a list of string for input `names`" otherwise.
I think it does the trick.

You have a point. The names and conventions are unlikely to change within the
limited scope of this ticket. For the follow-up tickets containing the rest of
Caruso's code the experimental decorator could be considered.

I don't think it makes it harder to refactor later on than now: it's exactly the same work, since the full implementation of skew polynomials has already been written, doctested etc. That's one reason I would suggest leaving it for a future ticket.

It just means we have to deal with getting old pickles to work, which might be non-trivial (granted, Sage is not always successful with this).

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-07-21 14:03:16

You do want to use `names`:

```
sage: preparse('R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)')
"R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, names=('x',)); (x,) = R._first_ngens(1)"
```


Some notes on the code from a skim through:

- You seem to be using the exact same format of polynomials, which contains a lot of old code. For example, don't implement a `_repr_()` that just calls (a _Python_ function) `_repr()`. This is useless (even in the usual polynomial ring code it seems); instead just implement `_repr_()`. Similarly, there are a number of methods you could simply `cpdef`.
- Kill with fire and holy water `is_*` methods. They just trivially call `isinstance`.
- You can use
  {{{
self._no_generic_basering_coercion = True
  }}}
  to avoid constructing the coercion from the base ring when initializing the skew polynomial ring.
- `_cmp_` is planned to be removed. Use `_richcmp_` instead.
- You should lazy import the ring constructor.
- You are double importing things in the element class; only keep the `cimport`'s.

Hi Travis,

You seem to understand these things quite well, and we had quite some problems
with getting this code to work, so could you please elaborate on the following
things:

That would be great. Can you give us the full list of the methods for which we can do this, or point us to how we can figure it out?

> - You can use

To be precise, do you mean that can insert the above line in `SkewPolynomialRing_general.__init__` just before the call to `Algebra.__init__`, and then remove the call to `self._unset_coercions_used()`? Or is there more to it?

> - `_cmp_` is planned to be removed. Use `_richcmp_` instead.

Are you talking about `SkewPolynomial._cmp_`? We spent many hours debugging the comparison code because it threw strange errors and segfaults. To avoid me spending many more hours, could I ask you to tell us exactly how to write the correct comparison code then?

Simon King's tutorial on implementing algebraic structures should be updated to be more informative on this, I think.

> - You should lazy import the ring constructor.

Do you mean `sage.rings.ring` in `skew_polynomial_ring.py`? Why is exactly that one important to lazily import?

Thanks for the help!

Best,
Johan

Which "is_" methods are you referring to? I couldn't really find any that call isinstance directly apart from the is_SkewPolynomialRing. For example, ``is_finite`` returns true if the base ring is finite and has order 1 and false otherwise. And so on. Each have minor conditions that the user could of course check themselves if need be, but its not always a one line call and its not always obvious what methods are available to the user so that they may verify. Should such methods then still be removed?

> - You are double importing things in the element class; only keep the `cimport`'s.
Could you elaborate with a tiny example or something what you mean by this? 

Again, thank you for your help!

Arpit.

Sorry, I misspoke slightly. It is the `is_*` functions, which as you say are things like `is_SkewPolynomialRing`.

You should make this change:


```diff
-from sage.structure.element import Element, AlgebraElement
 from sage.structure.element cimport Element, AlgebraElement, ModuleElement
 from sage.structure.parent cimport Parent
-from polynomial_compiled import CompiledPolynomialFunction
 from polynomial_compiled cimport CompiledPolynomialFunction
```

Anything python method (a `def`) which only calls a `cdef` method. Another example is `list` calling `_list_c`. IIRC, you can't do this for `__hash__` because this is a Python special method. I think `_list_c` is the only other one (and you can replace this by just calling the attribute `__coeffs`).

Yes, exactly.

You can look at `src/sage/rings/real_arb.pyx` or `src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx` for example. We can include the `_cmp_` as it is now, but it means some more hardship when we finally start converting.

> Simon King's tutorial on implementing algebraic structures should be updated to be more informative on this, I think.

Yes, it should be. It was written before we really had to worry about going to Python3.

> > - You should lazy import the ring constructor.
>

It is the thing which imports the rest of the code (once the `is_*` functions are gone). So all of the other files are not imported on startup, which helps keep that down because this is not a "common" object that the average user will use (IMO).

> Thanks for the help!

Thank you for the good discussions and work.

Comment by arpitdm created at 2016-07-22 23:05:50

Stuff fixed in the commits above based on latest set of discussions:
1. Improved descriptions for element, ring and ring constructor files
2. Improved definitions.
3. Input sanitization and INPUT block for init methods
4. `name` and `names` merged into a single `names` argument.
5. Improved documentation and tests for `twist_map`, make_generic_skew_polynomial` and other such methods.
6. Removed all functions that trivially called `isinstance`. Merged _repr_ and _repr into _repr_. 
7. Improved call to coercion, removed double imports, removed unnecessary imports. Added lazy import where possible.
8. Solving any doctests that came up in the course of the aforementioned changes.

Please let me know if I have missed something and of course any other changes that ought to be made. I'm now opening this for review.

Comment by dlucas created at 2016-07-25 09:06:24

Hello,

Good work on docstrings and module documentation, it's much better now.
However, I have some comments:

- documentation does not compile: it seems you have some formatting errors in bullet lists.
- you used single backquote notation at some places in the documentation where it should be 
 double backquotes, e.g. in `SkewPolynomial` class, you wrote `self` between single backquotes (which triggers LaTeX formatting) instead of double.
- a few lines below, `default: False`, `False` should be between double backquotes.
- you kept the import `import sage.misc.latex as latex`. I'm quite sure you can remove it, but in that case, you'll have to change `latex.latex(self.base_ring())` to `self.base_ring()._latex_()` (l. 359, skew_polynomial_ring.py). There's probably some more to change.

Apart from that, it looks good to me.
Patchbot says some doctests fails, but according to which doctests are failing, I'm quite sure it's not because of this ticket.

Best,

David

I think I managed to replace the _cmp_ method with _richcmp_. Please let me know if I did it incorrectly or something. Back tick inconsistencies are resolved. The latex import in skew_polynomial_element.pyx was removable, but the skew_polynomial_ring did not allow it. It threw up errors and I think its because the latex method of the self._map does not support it. 

Also, I don't understand what is going wrong when I try to build the documentation. I can't find any indentation errors.

This is the kind of error sphinx returns when there's no blank line after a bullet list. 
Usually, it's because you did not indented properly if you put several lines in a single bullet.
It should be like this:

```
- my first line
  and my second line
```


so it's not 4 whitespaces, it has to be aligned with the first character of the line above.

Anyway, for your issues, I'd say run `make doc-clean` and `make`.

David

Hi David,

I finally managed to make sense of the error messages that were showing up in the documentation. For instance,
[polynomia] docstring of sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_element:16: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.

Represents some error in the 16th line of the documentation of the file and so on..

And like you suggested, one set of errors was because it indented incorrectly. Anyway, I think I've solved all the issues (docs build successfully on my system) and I do get a path to all the html files. Can you please confirm this?

Oh, sorry, I thought you knew how to read these! Otherwise, I would have told you... It's not the most intuitive error message for sure, and I had some troubles with Sphinx compiler messages when I started working on Sage `:)`.

I just pulled your branch and I'm recompiling the reference manual. 
If everything goes smoothly, I don't have other remarks, so if Johan and Travis agree, we can set this to `positive_review`.

So, documentation compiles, tests passes, you fixed what we asked you to, I'm fine with it.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-07-26 17:20:42

The important thing is the first comment. The rest is more polish, but I think a fair amount more is needed.

- _All_ methods and functions must have doctests (e.g., the one added to `map.pyx` and hidden methods). Also, I think you should remove the commented out code.
- You should remove this line from `module_list.py`:
  {{{
# depends = numpy_depends),
  }}}
- I would swap these lines in `rings.py`:
  {{{#!diff
            
-            from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
             if isinstance(arg, tuple):
+                from sage.categories.morphism import Morphism
                 if len(arg) == 2 and isinstance(arg[1], Morphism):
                    from sage.rings.polynomial.skew_polynomial_ring_constructor import SkewPolynomialRing
                    return SkewPolynomialRing(self, arg[1], names=arg[0])
                 
  }}}
- Remove all trailing whitespace (well, at least do not add any).
- In `skew_polynomial_element.pyx`, there are a number of things that need to be in latex mode (and an equation using the `.. MATH::` block).
- I would move most-to-all of the module-level doc to the user entry point and then have a `.. SEEALSO:: block referencing said doc`, so it is visible from the `?` on the command line. This also applies to the parent class(es?) (i.e. module-level to class-level).
- You should make `list` into a `cpdef` with an output type of `list` and remove `_list_c`.
- For `__iter__`, just iterate over `self.__coeffs`. Actually, a similar statement applies to many other places you call `_list_c` where you don't expose it to the user or modify the list (e.g., `__getitem__` and `_richcmp_`. The multivariate and sparse versions should be overriding these methods anyways.
- You should use the cached version of `0` instead of going through coercion and getting a new object in memory:
  {{{#!diff
         try:
             l = (<SkewPolynomial>self)._list_c()[n]
             return l
         except IndexError:
-            c = self.base_ring()(0)
-            return c
+            return self.base_ring().zero()
  }}}
- Use Python3 syntax for errors: `raise IndexError("skew polynomials are immutable")`.
- Similar to above: `self.parent()(0)` -> `self.parent().zero()`.
- `is_nilpotent` should have a short description of what the method should do (as well as the intended operation).
- `Returns` -> `Return` in a few first-line of docstrings.
- `.. Note::` -> `.. NOTE::` (this is a consistency thing).
- You have a blank `.. SEEALSO::` in `__floordiv__`.
- `is_left_divisible_by` doesn't have a short description. Similar for other such methods.
- Error messages should start with a lowercase letter (this was something we've agreed upon in somewhat more recent history).
- There is a preference to have ```True``` in code formatting since it is a Python object/concept.
- Actually, a number of functions that use `_list_c` should be moved to the concrete class (and maybe an ``@`abstract_method` placeholder done in the ABC.

I might have some more comments later too. However this is looking very good and it will be a great addition to Sage.

Also, the `_richcmp_` looks correct (although I don't have time right now to run any serious tests).

The implemented operator evaluation `__call__` is incorrect. For instance, `1(a) = a` and `x(a) = sigma(a)` in a correct implementation, but that is not the case here. The following implementation works:


```
    if eval_pt not in self._parent:
        raise TypeError("Evaluation point must be a ring element")
    sigma = self._parent.twist_map()
    coefficients = self.coefficients(sparse=False)
    sum = self._parent.zero()
    a = eval_pt
    for c in coefficients:
        sum += c * a
        a = sigma(a)
    return sum
```


I think we should make an effort to cythonize this method. Could you try that Arpit?

Best,
Johan

I would make a change like this:

```diff
 """
 Top/Module-level
 
-Description
 """
 class Foo:
     """
     Class-level.
+
+    Description
     """

That way when you do `Foo?`, you get `Description`. You also want some cross-linking so that someone using the online doc has links to follow to get to `Description`.

Don't make it double underscore (you can also do the explicit name-mangling). In general, I avoid double underscores so you can use the hidden attributes in subclasses (unless you really wanted it to be completely hidden from all subclasses, which is very rare).

ABC = Abstract Base Class, so the methods you have that just raise a `NotImplementedError` (e.g., `_inplace_add`), you should have them be blank (modulo a docstring and a doctest of a concrete implementation) with a ``@`abstract_method`. These then get picked up by a failure of the `TestSuite`.

I tried adding the `@`abstract_method to the `cdef void _inplace_add` method and I got an error message saying "Cdef functions/classes cannot take arbitrary decorators." According to [their docs](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html), I don't think decorators are implemented yet.

Some doctests are still missing. If you're not sure you documented everything, use the following command: `sage -coverage <path_to_files>`. On my side, it returns:

Also, documentation does not compile:

- line 872 in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx`, I think it would be better to return an error message with the exception `ValueError`.

- There are some undocumented methods/classes in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx` (starting at line 2776 with `_left_pow`).

- There's still one old style `raise` statement (l. 494 in `skew_polynomial_ring.py`).

- Is there any sense to the function `make_generic_skew_polynomial`? Shouldn't
  it just be removed? (incidentally, I don't see the sense of
  `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.make_generic_polynomial` either,
  which presumably was the inspiration to `make_generic_skew_polynomial`.)

- You created `_leftpow_` and `_rightpow_` from `__pow__` to avoid the optional
  argument `side`. But they are not standard magic functions, so there's no
  sense in them being underscore-methods. Rather, they should be called
  something different. E.g `power_left_mod` and `power_right_mod`, where
  `modulus` is now a mandatory argument.

- I'm worried about the `_inplace_*` methods: they are not doc-tested but are
  also not indirectly used anywhere (except `_inplace_pow` which is used in
  `_leftpow` and `_inplace_rmul` which is used in `_inplace_pow`). I only tried
  to read `_inplace_add` yet, but already found one bug (duplicate line `x +=
  y[len(x):]`). I would prefer that these methods be removed, possibly
  reinstated at a later time when they will be used (and hence at least
  slightly doctested). I believe they were more arduously used in the Karatsuba
  or factorisation implementations?

The `is_nilpotent` method is not implemented since order of the automorphism is not supported in Sage yet. How about if I remove this method completely and place the note instead in `def is_unit`? Or should I leave it as it is? 
> Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
>      * line 3129: cpdef Element _call_with_args(self, x, args=(), kwds={})
There is a `cpdef Element _call_(self, x)` method that does exactly the same thing as the above method. Do we need to keep both or can we keep the more general `_call_with_args` and remove `_call_`?

Yup. I believe that was the inspiration. And I agree. If one wants to make a generic skew polynomial using coefficients, it can be directly done without using this method.

Yes. They are used in factorizations and center related methods. Which is why it was not possible to add indirect tests for them either. Alright, removing `_inplace_add`, `_inplace_sub` and `_inplace_rmul`.

I fixed some other stuff that I came across. Most importantly, I changed the parent type of `SkewPolynomialBaseringInjection` so that it mimics `PolynomialBaseringInjection`: I'm not fully understanding the extend of what this means, but if `PolynomialBaseringInjection` should be a `Morphism` and not a `RingHomomorphism`, then I don't see why it should be different for `SkewPolynomialBaseringInjection`.

I also removed `_call_with_args`: as the name says, it's there for supporting calling an object that takes more than one argument. This makes sense in the very general `PolynomialBaseringInjection` as the example in the source shows. But it doesn't (yet) make any sense for skew polynomial rings, so I've removed it for now. If it should ever be useful, someone can add it at that time. For now, it will simply throw a (somewhat meaningful) error when one tries to apply more than one argument to a call to a `SkewPolynomialBaseringInjection`.

There's a bug in `right_lcm`. I don't yet know what it is but here is an example which makes it blow up:

    {{{
    k.<a> = GF(3^2,'a')
    sigma = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
    S.<x> = k['x', sigma]
    (x^2 + 1*x + a).right_lcm(x - a)
    <BOOM>
    NotImplementedError: the leading coefficient is not a unit
    }}}

Since we're over a field, it must be the `ZeroDivisionError` causing this, which should never happen.

I also don't see why we should catch the `ZeroDivisionError`: it is never
expected behaviour that `V3` is 0?

As an aside, the naming in this and related methods is terrible: `R` means two very different things in 10 lines, and the skew polynomial variables should not be capitalised.

Best,
Johan


---

Comment by caruso created at 2016-08-02 08:11:30

The problem comes from the multiplication by the skew polynomial 0 which does not work as expected (it returns a polynomial of positive degree):

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(5^2)
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(k, k.frobenius_endomorphism())
sage: zero = S(0)*x
sage: zero.degree()
1
sage: zero + 1
 + 1
```



---

Comment by jsrn created at 2016-08-02 09:44:48

Thanks Xavier: it turned out that the problem was even with `S(0)`, which got represented as `[0]` instead of `[]`. I fixed it now and added a test for posterity.

Just skimming the code, not a full review...

1. All this

```
        if op == 0:
            return x < y
        elif op == 1:
            return x <= y
        elif op == 2:
            return x == y
        elif op == 3:
            return x != y
        elif op == 4:
            return x > y
        else:
            return x >= y
```

can be replaced by `return PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)`, see `src/sage/structure/coerce.pyx` for an example.

2. Lots of private methods are unused:

```
    cdef void _inplace_add(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cdef void _inplace_sub(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cdef void _inplace_lmul(self, SkewPolynomial_generic_dense right)
    cpdef _leftpow_(self,right,modulus=*)
```

Since these are private, I see no point in implementing them.

3. The `.pxd` file contains too much stuff. In particular, the following all seems unused:

```
include "cysignals/signals.pxi"
include "../../ext/cdefs.pxi"
include '../../ext/stdsage.pxi'

from sage.rings.integer cimport Integer
from polynomial_compiled cimport CompiledPolynomialFunction
```

Some of this might be needed in `.pyx` files, but then it should be in the `.pyx` file. The `include` statements for `cdefs.pxi` and `stdsage.pxi` should be replaced instead by the relevant `cimport` statements.

4. Use the standard copyright template from http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#headings-of-sage-library-code-files

5. `__getslice__` is deprecated.

6. `__mod__` should use the coercion model (#269).

7. `__floordiv__` should use the coercion model (#2034).

8. Replace `trac #13215` by `:trac:`13215``

9. In several places, you use exact type checks of the form `type(x) is foo`. Why not `isinstance(x, foo)`?

Just a remark (feel free to change this or not): there is no point in writing `cdef list` here since you're not using the fact that it's a `list`:

```
        cdef list x = (<SkewPolynomial>left)._coeffs
        cdef list y = (<SkewPolynomial>right)._coeffs
        return PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)
```


In general one should avoid such pointless type declarations.

In this case, it doesn't hurt since Cython knows anyway that it's a list (`_coeffs` is declared to be a `list`).

By copyright, do you mean add names inside the block too? I added myself and Johan as authors (commit ac109c8)

As for the cdef list, I went with the rest of the code on the ticket which declares  things similarly at the time. But I can change that.

Hello,

There's still some small issues here:

- `ValueError` line 836 in `skew_polynomial_element.pyx` does not have any error message to explain
 to the user why this exception was raised.

- There's one old raise statement l.528 in `skew_polynomial_ring.py` (`raise IndexError, "generator n not defined"`) 

- Some methods in `skew_polynomial_element,pyx` are still undocumented. Even if I'm kind of ok with `_call_` not having a short description, I'm definitely not fine with a constructor  (l. 2945) without any description of its input parameters...

Back to `needs_work`.

Hello,

It seems good to me.
I just have two remarks:

- You wrote error messages for every exception, including `ZeroDivisionError` and `NotImplementedError`. IMHO, it's not necessary to write (for instance) `ZeroDivisionError("division by zero is not valid")`. To be honest, I would have been fine with it... But you wrote `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero is not valid` which I think is not compatible with Python 3 (not sure though).

- There's a broken doctest:

```
File "../rings/polynomial/rings.py", line 744, in sage.rings.polynomial.rings.Rings.ParentMethods.__getitem__
Failed example:
    k['x',Frob]
Expected:
    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in t of size 5^3 twisted by Frobenius Endomorphism x |-> x^5 on Finite Field in t of size 5^3
Got:
    Skew Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field in t of size 5^3 twisted by t |--> t^5

```


Apart from that, I'm fine with your changes, tests pass and a lot of work have been done here. Issues found by reviewers have been fixed, and if no one objects, I'll set this to `positive_review` on the next iteration.

Best,

David

I looked up online if it was required to write an error message along with `ZeroDivisionError` since it seems pretty obvious what the error is. It seems, that depending on the situation, this error can mean different things and people write "infinity", "not valid" or simply "division by zero" as an error message after raising the error (python 3 [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)). And my thinking behind adding an error message for `NotImplementedError` is to allow the user to understand the reason behind this not being implemented. Should I remove them?

There isn't a `rings.py` file in `sage/rings/polynomial`. That was moved to `sage/categories` and the doctest passes there. Maybe you have some portion of an older version of this ticket?

Comment by dlucas created at 2016-08-09 11:52:30

Mmh maybe... But it's weird though because I recompiled 7.3 a few days ago, then made a branch and pulled your branch from #13215. I have the latest version of this ticket on my local branch (commit 88196bf) and there's a file `rings.py` in `rings/polynomial`.
Even with my clean version of 7.3 as it's available from download (I always keep a clean version of the `develop` branch), I can find such a file...

Anyway, as `git log rings/polynomial/rings.py` returns nothing while `git log categories/rings.py` returns your commits, I probably messed up somewhere.

So, I guess we're good to go now.
If no one objects, I'll set this ticket to positive review.

Comment by jsrn created at 2016-08-11 19:12:05

Sorry to object, but I would like to re-insist on adding the experimental decorator on construction of skew polynomials. The reason is that I'm right now talking to a researcher in skew polynomials (Felice Manganiello), and he is making me aware of considerations that might mean some restructuring down the road. In particular, his natural notion of evaluation is *not* operator evaluation, but rather right (resp. left) modulo of `x-a`.

Therefore, it is not clear that the syntax `f(a)` should mean operator evaluation. Perhaps it should be e.g. `f(a, 'operator')` etc. or something different. In any case, it demonstrates that this module is maybe not as mature as we had initially assumed.

Best,
Johan

This reminds me of the three approaches to evaluating a skew polynomial we discussed once before. One of them was, given a skew polynomial `p` and a point `a`, `p(a) = p.right_quo_rem(x-a)` (resp. left). Which I believe is what you are referring to? I think we now have the features to support this generalization of the remainder evaluation method in the non-commutative case. Or perhaps, we add an option to the `call` method. It takes as argument the algorithm "remainder" (or "operator") and default is set to one of them. That way the third approach of using normal basis can also be easily added if need be in the future.

Best,
Arpit.

The only thing I would agree with being marked experimental in this case would be the evaluation (i.e., `__call__`), which would be the only thing that would really see this (behavioral) change. I also think we should take the time to get this consistent with the conventions of skew polynomial research. Could you give Felice access to the code to experiment with (in particular, to get feedback on what additional features he would want and bottlenecks)?

Did anyone look at the compiled documentation? I highly doubt the pdf documentation would build because `\base_ring_endomorphism` is not valid latex.

Looking more closely, there are also some incorrect statements about the code and many overly verbose statements (e.g., the definition of an automorphism). I'm going over the doc and code now trying to clean things up. However, you currently have an issue in that the skew polynomials themselves do not pickle (which was caught by a `TestSuite(S).run()` test I'm adding). Feel free to push changes and I can merge them into my branch once this is fixed.

Pickling is how Python allows you to save data. In particular, you want

```
sage: loads(dumps(x)) == x
True
```

for (essentially) any object `x`.

Hi,

> {{{

> for (essentially) any object `x`.

So I ran some examples and here's what I have so far. When the base ring is a finite field of the form `GF(q^m)`, pickling succeeds, but unpickling does not. Specifically, it fails to recognize or coerce the exponent `m` as an integer, I think. I tried pickling various other skew polynomials over Integer Ring, Rational Field, etc. and it works just fine. I don't understand where the problem is coming from. Also,


```
sage: k.<t> = GF(5^3)
sage: Frob = k.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: S.<x> = k['x', Frob]
sage: loads(dumps(S)) == S
Traceback:
...
ValueError: (ValueError('exponent must be an integer',), <function SkewPolynomialRing at 0x7f02ca186140>, (Finite Field in t of size 5^3, Identity endomorphism of Finite Field in t of size 5^3, 'x', False))

sage: loads(dumps(k)) == k
True
sage: loads(dumps(Frob)) == Frob
False
```



---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-12 12:42:07

The bigger problem is that a skew polynomial itself does not pickle:

```
sage: R.<t> = ZZ[]
sage: sigma = R.hom([t+1])
sage: S.<x> = SkewPolynomialRing(R, sigma)
sage: loads(dumps(x))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'dictproxy'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.dictproxy failed
```


With that being said, the above pickling issue with the Frobenius endomorphism is a separate issue that necessitates a ticket:

```
sage: loads(dumps(Frob))
Identity endomorphism of Finite Field in t of size 5^3
```

in addition to this independent issue:

```
sage: Frob.parent() is Hom(k, k)
True
sage: Hom(k, k)(Frob)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

Comment by arpitdm created at 2016-08-12 13:13:21

Yes. I was able to recreate this error earlier myself. But I figured that the correct pickling of the ring was dependent on the correct pickling of the underlying automorphism and every other attribute for that matter. 

How can I resolve these coercion errors? Any pointers would be really helpful. I have no idea where these stem from.

Best,
Arpit.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-12 13:24:42

Well, the pickling issue doesn't stem from coercion, nor does it have to do with the pickling of the parent (which worked okay). It is likely that you need to implement a `__reduce__` method.

The _conversion_ failure of `Frob` above is likely coming from the generic code for `Homset` being too strict, but as I said, this is an independent issue.

Comment by arpitdm created at 2016-08-12 20:49:51

I've added a `__reduce__` method that pickles and unpickles a skew polynomial and a skew polynomial ring over a non-finite base ring correctly now. The error in the earlier example you mentioned is now resolved. However, the problem with the finite fields case persists. I haven't managed to swat that bug away yet. 
Any ideas on what is causing that?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-12 23:46:45

The (un)pickling of the Frobenius (well, perhaps its base class) is not setting the `_power` correctly:

```
sage: Frob.power()
1
sage: loads(dumps(Frob)).power()
0
```

The solution is probably to make the `__reduce__` less generic. This will need to be a separate ticket (which we don't have to make as a dependency of this one).

About the experimental warning: `@`arpitdm: yes, what you describe is exactly the other evaluation notions, so it is not complicated to implement them - it is only a matter of discussing interface. For progressing with our GSoC, I strongly prefer to take that discussion in a follow-up ticket (e.g. during SD75) and just mark skew polynomials with the experimental warning.

`@`tscrim: Marking *only* `__call__` is certainly an option, and will be less disconcerting to users who wants to take skew polynomials into use soon, and I am also sort of OK with this. However, I prefer to mark the entire module as experimental: this `__call__` issue might just be the first example of other similar conventions. Felice has already asked for a trac account and will look at the functionality when he has time. But in the interest of being able to continue with our other goals, I would strongly prefer to get this major ticket closed before we are sure everything has converged, and the point of the experimental decorator is exactly to be able to do that.

Best,
Johan

Comment by jsrn created at 2016-08-13 09:55:48

I renamed `power_left_mod` to `left_power_mod` similarly for `right`. I suggested the old names myself, but realised that it's much better if all such sided operations begin with left/right (and all the other sided operations already do).

If we are placing the experimental decorator, which I think we should, I second placing it over the entire skew polynomial ticket. Because `call` is not the only one that will be changed. Derivations are missing. Anyone who is working on skew polynomial research will probably point that out immediately. And there could be a bunch of changes to accommodate that.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-13 14:18:41

I've gone through and made some cleanup to the documentation and code. I've made the `SkewPolynomial` actually behave like an ABC that can be subclassed to sparse skew polynomials (mainly, removed the `_coeffs` attribute).

I strongly disagree with marking the entire class with ``@`experimental`. For example, all of the changes I did would not require any deprecation, i.e., the public API and behavior was unchanged. If you know you must change the API/behavior to accommodate something, then this code has no business being in Sage and you should just go ahead and do it. If the behavior could undergo (radical) changes, then the code isn't (IMO) correct and should not be included.

(Personally, I see very little use-cases for ``@`experimental` and no real use at the top-level. People who will actually experiment with the code will be those who can just get the code from the trac server (which requires no login). By marking something at the top-level, nobody will really use the code because there are no guarantees.)

I see we disagree on the ``@`experimental` decorator itself. It is a "local beta", in that it says: "you can count on this functionality being in Sage soon in roughly the same shape. If you want to use it already, be prepared that the API might change mildly". It facilitates Request-for-comments from developers who believe they have well-designed some module, but acknowledge that they might not have considered everything. This goes doubly for math code, since any given math structure can be considered from so many angles, and usually the initial developer considers mostly just one. It allows building other new stuff on top of it (which we really need now: #20970), which postponing the ticket wouldn't, and that new stuff might not need an ``@`experimental` warning itself (for #20970, skew polynomials is just a tool, and its exact API has roughly no bearing on the API of the Gabidulin codes).

The decorator was originally suggested because without it, it is difficult to start introducing the "basic" modules on a new set of functionality, since one can only really judge its design once many things have been developed on top of it. This happened for us in coding theory, where we felt forced to have our own fork of Sage and develop for nine months before making the first pushes to Sage, greatly complicating the development process.

See also the discussion here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/LXWs6KOw0Lk.
This ticket is exactly one of the intended use cases for this decorator.

I still insist on the module-wide experimental warning here. I expect I will be active in polishing the skew polynomial module in the coming months, and I really don't want to be burdened/limited by deprecation considerations all the time. On the other hand, we really need this ticket to go into Sage to proceed with the GSoC, and at least >95% of the current functionality and API is good.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-14 13:04:59

From the discussion above, there are suggestions of _major_ behavioral and API changes, not mild. While this is not the hill I necessarily want to die on, I do have a use-case for this code. By saying the module is "subject to change without notice" means I can't build upon it because it could break all of my code, as well as yours for #20970. You say you only need this as a tool, but suppose #20970 is merged before this is stable and then you force whomever has to make changes to this code to also fix your code (which defeats the entire point) or your code gets broken if it is something not doctested.

You also seem stuck on the idea the code has to be merged in order to proceed with GSoC. You can build other code on top of this, and this doesn't need to be merged by the end of the program for the GSoC to be considered successful (granted, it took a little too long for the knot theory GSoC code to get merged).

Additionally, if 95% of the code is set, then mark the 5% with ``@`experimental` if you think it is that likely to change. If you disagree, then I am forced to disagree with your assessment of the completeness of the code. As a reminder, _internal_ changes do not need to be deprecated (for example, none of the changes I pushed would not require one).

I don't consider the `__call__` discussion a major change. My current idea for accommodating multiple notions of evaluation would be to throw a warning/error when `__call__` is used before "setting" the default evaluation on the skew polynomial ring in question. That's a completely local change (local to `__call__`. But as I mentioned, I prefer to postpone that discussion to a later ticket.

> While this is not the hill I necessarily want to die on, I do have a use-case for this code.

As I said, I imagine that it would be an overlapping set of developers (at least me) who would improve skew polynomials in the forseeable future, as well as use it before it was "stable", in e.g. #20970. This is, once again, what I would regard the common use-case of ``@`experimental` (whoever adds some feature usually needs it him/herself).

If you want to build upon this code yourself, I also don't understand your stance: not having ``@`experimental` means that any near-future sensible change to this module's API will be clumsy to accommodate. If you have made use of this module in the mean-time, either included in Sage or not, there's two possible outcomes: the improvement is not done, or it is done and your code will start spewing warnings. I don't see how either outcomes are better than what would happen with the ``@`experimental` warning on.

> You also seem stuck on the idea the code has to be merged in order to proceed with GSoC. You can build other code on top of this, and this doesn't need to be merged by the end of the program for the GSoC to be considered successful (granted, it took a little too long for the knot theory GSoC code to get merged).

You know how it is: unmerged code just has a much larger probability of rotting on trac or ending up causing a huge workload for the mentors/other interessants of the project. We already have a queue of 4 tickets waiting for this one, and I really want to pop most of them before GSoC runs out!

> Additionally, if 95% of the code is set, then mark the 5% with ``@`experimental` if you think it is that likely to change.

But I don't *know* what could change! It's my assessment that this is pretty close to stable, and Xavier, Arpit, David, Burcin, you, and me have thought things pretty well through. But it *is* a large, new structure to Sage.

> If you disagree, then I am forced to disagree with your assessment of the completeness of the code. As a reminder, _internal_ changes do not need to be deprecated (for example, none of the changes I pushed would not require one).

I am somewhat shocked at how vehemently you are against the ``@`experimental` decorator. Discussion on sage-devel it is, I guess...

The discussion on sage-devel seems to have tapered off, so we need to take a decision here. We got two pieces of input: leif suggested a compromise with a warning in the doc, and wstein seemed to favour something like not pre-importing the module until the module is deemed "stable".

IMHO, neither of the two shared your concerns of not being able to build upon
the module, and seemed OK with the idea of accepting not-completely-stable code
into Sage. Conversely, they apparently didn't really like `@`experimental in the current form either.

I like both of the alternative suggestions less than just including the module and defining it as stable, handling any possible deprecation warnings that might arise in the near future. However, I still claim that using `@`experimental on the module is the right way to go.

But in the interest of progressing, I leave it to you Travis: if you are still strongly against a module-level `@`experimental, let's drop it. I guess you are still OK with having `@`experimental on __call__, together with a sensible message in the doc, e.g.


```
    WARNING::

        Currently only "operator evaluation" of skew polynomials is implemented. There are two other common notions of evaluation of `f(x)` at some `a` from the base ring, namely the remainder after left or right modulo by `x-a`. The current calling convention might change in the future to accommodate these.
```

Johan

I still strongly am against a module-level ``@`experimental`, but I think this is a good compromise. Positive review on my part once this is done. Thank you for your input and work on this!

Based on the conclusions reached above, I tried adding the experimental warning to the call method. And I get an error message while building Sage that seems to that it is not possible to add the experimental decorator at all.

```

Ah ok, that's a snag. Have you tried looking up the source code for ``@`experimental` in `sage/misc/superseded.py`? You should be able to just print the warning manually as the first line of `__call__`. Perhaps add a comment mentioning this emulates ``@`experimental` such that it can be found if one greps "`@`experimental".

Best,
Johan


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-18 12:42:46

That's right, it's a Cython issue because double-underscore methods need to be assigned to slots at compile time (or at least be handled in a special way), so decorators don't work on them. I agree with comment:181, just issue the warning yourself.

Hello,

I've added the experimental warning to the `__call__` method manually based on the source code for `experimental` as suggested by `@`jsrn. There are a couple of doctests that "fail" because they issue the experimental warning before returning the correct answer. Should I modify the doctests or keep them as it is?

Best,
Arpit.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-08-18 13:56:54

You need to make sure all doctests pass, so you need to include the warning in the doctest output.


---

Comment by dlucas created at 2016-08-18 13:57:37

As warnings are issued only once per session, you can fix this by triggering the experimental warning in a specific "doctest" at the top of the file.
See what have been done in `rings/asymptotic/asymptotic_ring.py` for instance.

`@`jsm `@`dlucas Warnings for doctests are handled different than in a session. For deprecation warnings, these are done every time the deprecation message is hit, and I believe that behavior extends to all warnings.

`@`arpitdm If you are going to do a redirection, which is good for if evaluation does change provided you give it a more descriptive name (and include it as part of the public API), I believe you can just mark the (Python) function with the decorator without problem (as it is no longer a special method).

Is that a recent behaviour? Because triggering the experimental warning once works just fine in the file I referenced above. I also used this myself in #20284 and it also worked perfectly.

As David, I have my doubts about this too...

Agree, since you did an indirection anyway. `operator_eval` is a more descriptive name. Then the two others that we might add later on could be `left_mod_eval` and `right_mod_eval`; not too long, uses very common abbreviations, and all follow the same style.


---

It's also quite possible that classes and methods/functions are handled differently by the decorator.

As far as understand, one has to use the decorator ``@`coerce_binop` for all binary operations.

A helper function `def _call` has been added that acts as a helper function to accommodate for operator evaluation. The `def operator_eval` is available as a public method. And the experimental warning is triggered at the top of the module. The segmentation fault due to `Graphics()` for `def right_quo_rem` (resp. left) have been resolved.

- You need to change the docstring of `_call` to reflect that its existence is only because of ``@`experimental`:

```
Helper function for the ``__call__`` method to accommodate
the ```@`experimental`` decorator.
```

- I think you should make `operator_eval` into a `cpdef` method as it will likely be an important method (and should have a C version). You also need to change
  {{{#!diff
-(<RingElement> c)*a
+c * a
  }}}
  so the skew polynomial ring can support non-`RingElement` classes as a coefficients and to avoid an unneeded type check by Cython.
- You have added extra coercion checks for each step of things like `left_xgcd`. I feel that you would be better having a public method that does ``@`coerce_binop` and then private (`cdef`?) functions that assume both elements belong to the same parent. If you don't think this is so important, than don't feel compelled to change it.
- Are the `*_monic` methods useful to have at the public namespace (instead of (effectively hidden) `cdef` methods)? I feel one can just divide by the leading coefficient and that this operation will not be called frequently by a user.

Seems like the gain would currently be very small, since these methods now mostly do not call each other internally. If this changes later on, the private method can be added at this time.

Usual commutative polynomials have a `monic` method. This is the analogue for non-commutative polynomials.

However this feels it could be used in tight loops, and so while individual calls are marginal, the net sum over 10000 loops can add up. I leave it up to you.

Only for univariate, and in that case all it does is divide by the leading coefficient. However, in that case it extends the base ring so the leading coefficient is a unit, which is different than the behavior here. Also, I don't necessarily see the point of having `monic` in the public API for commutative polynomials (and don't take that as a guide for what must/should be included in the API).

It's mostly the relative gain that's important, which is still low as long as the functions don't call each other a lot.

I think it's a handy helper function that I think people will expect. I've used `monic` for univariate polynomials many times. (for multivariate polynomials, it's much more ambiguous what can be meant so the helper function is less useful).

          should be normalized to be monic. This parameter must be passed as a

  }}}
  At least I don't see a reason why must go `monic=True` as an argument (for everything but `left_xgcd`).
  Actually, I don't see why `left_xgcd` has unlimited number of arguments but `right_xgcd` does not.
- This change make it seem like there is one unique skew polynomial ring (to rule them all :P).
  {{{#!diff

- You should not break `:trac:`13215`` across multiple lines (I might just be paranoid for this one though).

Indeed. I've chatted with Xavier, and the original reason for the "This parameter must be passed as named argument" (and perhaps the `*` in `left_xgcd`) is the broken behaviour of `coerce_binop`. This has now been fixed, see #21322. Therefore I've now set the doc and the code to what it should be as soon as #21322 is merged.

OK, that change was a bit fast ;-)

I found this overkill, which is why I removed it. But if you insist.

I disagree. It makes the source code look terrible. Also:


```
$ grep  '.\{80,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l 
4703
```


So the 80 chars/line is defacto not a convention upheld in raise-statements.

Indeed. Emacs reflow doesn't understand Sphinx magic syntax probably doesn't allow line breaks :-)

The entirety of the `__call__` doc reads better now, IMHO: the first line clearly states that operator evaluation is considered. So the note doesn't need to repeat this.

Indeed.

It makes the source code look fine if you are using < ~160 chars wide editors. We do try to stick to ~80 character lines overall in the code, but it is not absolute. Plus, there is a big difference between 90 chars and ~160 chars. IMO, a more fair comparison would be to look at how many `raise` statements are 80,90,100,100+ lines. I do not see the gain for the long line unless you have an editor with a very large character line limit (literally).

The key word is "only", and the `__call__` doc does not mention this (nor is it anywhere else IIRC).

I went through the docs once and clarified them in some places where it was not clear/missing and made some small changes to standardize the docs whereever possible.

Based on discussions with `@`caruso and `@`jsrn, the `def reverse` method is inappropriate in that, reversing a skew polynomial actually involves creating a new skew polynomial ring over the inverse twist map. And that requires more consideration since twist map cannot always be inverted in Sage and also perhaps since "dual_ring" or something like that could also be nice to have.

Best,
Arpit.

Changes like:

```diff
`@``@` -134,7 +134,7 `@``@` cdef class SkewPolynomial(AlgebraElement):
     where `\sigma` is the base ring automorphism. This is called
     the *operator evaluation* method.
 
-    EXAMPLES:
+    EXAMPLES::
 
     We illustrate some functionalities implemented in this class.
 
```

are wrong because text follows, not (indented) code. So the last commit should be reverted. Also, I disagree with changing the `.. TODO::` block because it is a TODO.

One other thing I just noticed, a better test than `if not isinstance(base_ring, ring.CommutativeRing):` would be `if base_ring not in Rings().Commutative():` as it is a mathematical check, not an implementation check.

It is also okay to have methods that rely on others than can error out in certain cases when implementations are not done yet. Just FYI.

You also did not need to change `r"""` for every docstring (it doesn't hurt, but it is only necessary when you have escape `\` characters).

I just checked whether the html documentation builds and in this particular case, it did not give an error while in a couple of other places it did.

Do you mean, changing the name from `TODO` to `NOTE` or the description as well?

Okay. I will change that.

I was just trying to follow the conventions in other files where I saw that `r"""` is used everywhere. So while, I was going through the code, I figured, it didn't hurt to change it.

You made a change `.. TODO::` -> `.. NOTE::`, where the message is describing a TODO.

Yes, it's perfectly fine (in some aspects, it should be the standard way we do docstrings in Sage). This was another just FYI and future reference.

Replying to [comment:221 tscrim]:

Not in our opinion: what we do here is the intended behaviour of coerce_binop,
and the decorated methods works as well as all other methods in Sage decorated
with coerce_binop. So #21322 is just a (already known) bug that should be fixed.

> It makes the source code look fine if you are using < ~160 chars wide editors.

??? The line is 141 chars. Also, having a < 160 chars editor doesn't make the
old 4-line wrapping look good.

Indeed my point before.

```
    $ grep  '.\{100,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    1628

    $ grep  '.\{120,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    588

    $ grep  '.\{140,\}' -r src/sage | grep "raise" | wc -l
    210
```


Also, btw:


```
    $ grep  '.\{140,\}' -r src/sage | wc -l
    10459
```


So it's not like you're not likely to come across a long line in your editor
while editing Sage codes.

It says "The current calling convention might change in the future to
accommodate these. Therefore, the current method has been marked as
experimental.". Try to read the doc-string in its entirety -- it really does say
everything.

Oh yeah, forgot to add about the whole wrapping thing: I now pushed a compromise where the line is wrapped in two but takes up 92 chars.

It makes it more consistent and it is a standard way to split long lines of text by PEP8.

I can accept the 92 char lines as a compromise.

There are a number of lines that are forced to be long because they are large numbers with no spaces. Plus, I have no idea exactly how many lines of code we have in Sage, but this smells of a fallacy.

I very carefully had read it, and no, it does not say everything. It does not say that this is the _only_ type of evaluation currently implemented. I know this is dangerously close to bikeshedding because this is only visible at the code level. Yet, I think it is important to state why we are (currently) doing things this way: there currently is no other option.

Sorry for this grumbling. I shouldn't reply to comments before my morning coffee.

Anyway, it seems the issues are getting exponentially less important, so perhaps we can positive review this ticket soon.

Sorry I have a bit of a stick up my `@`$* about this, but I'd like to get this right. So we don't have to deal with issues because someone came along and changed things due to a lack of documentation.

Anyways, I believe we are at a positive review.
