This ticket implements a SAT solver by relying upon the MILP features of Sage.

This is not glorious, but at least the feature is available by default and we can assume it exists in all cases.

Since cryptominisat is optional for (much) more than one year, why not make it standard ?

I do not like it either. But the doc of the same function in cryptominisat says that the function returns None when it is interrupted.

I don't believe that doc. From an example based on a doctest:

```
sage: from sage.sat.solvers import CryptoMiniSat          # optional - cryptominisat
sage: from sage.sat.converters.polybori import CNFEncoder # optional - cryptominisat

sage: sr = mq.SR(1,4,4,4,gf2=True,polybori=True)          # optional - cryptominisat
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()                        # optional - cryptominisat
sage: cms = CryptoMiniSat(maxrestarts=10,verbosity=0)     # optional - cryptominisat
sage: phi = CNFEncoder(cms, F.ring())(F)                  # optional - cryptominisat

A few more details:

1. It's ugly that your ILP solver returns values as `0.0` and `1.0`. It should be converted to `True`/`False`.

2. `Its performances` -> `Its performance`

3. `cryptominisat_available = True` -> `solver = 'cryptominisat'` and `cryptominisat_available = False` -> `solver = 'LP'`. That's a lot cleaner: you can remove the `solver is None` checks.

4. Please fix the `deicison` typo also in `src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py`

Done.
