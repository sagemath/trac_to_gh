# Issue 18805: Default SAT solver in Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19042

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2015-08-16 18:33:42

CC:  malb vdelecroix tmonteil

This ticket implements a SAT solver by relying upon the MILP features of Sage.

This is not glorious, but at least the feature is available by default and we can assume it exists in all cases.

Since cryptominisat is optional for (much) more than one year, why not make it standard ?

Check the license and if it is compatible write to sage-devel. It may still be useful to have a LP backend to double-check results.

Why call it "LP" when it's an ILP?

> Why call it "LP" when it's an ILP?

I use it as a generic term. LP, MILP, ILP... As long as people understand what it is about ..

Just a comment: why is `src/sage/sat/solvers/sat_lp.pyx` a Cython file? You don't seem to use any Cython features...

I also don't like the `except KeyboardInterrupt`. Why did you add that?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-09-30 12:58:57

We now have `PackageNotFoundError` (in `src/sage/misc/package.py`) for this:

```
        except ImportError:
            raise ImportError("To enable this feature, run 'sage -i cryptominisat'.")
```


I remind you that this is an expensive check: `is_package_installed('cryptominisat')`
Checking whether the `import` succeeds is a lot more efficient.

Probably because it used to be a copy/paste of the cryptominisat file. I can change it if you prefer.

I do not like it either. But the doc of the same function in cryptominisat says that the function returns None when it is interrupted.

Replying to [comment:10 ncohen]:
> But the doc of the same function in cryptominisat says that the function returns None when it is interrupted.

I don't believe that doc. From an example based on a doctest:

```
sage: from sage.sat.solvers import CryptoMiniSat          # optional - cryptominisat
sage: from sage.sat.converters.polybori import CNFEncoder # optional - cryptominisat
sage: set_random_seed( 22 )                               # optional - cryptominisat
sage: sr = mq.SR(1,4,4,4,gf2=True,polybori=True)          # optional - cryptominisat
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()                        # optional - cryptominisat
sage: cms = CryptoMiniSat(maxrestarts=10,verbosity=0)     # optional - cryptominisat
sage: phi = CNFEncoder(cms, F.ring())(F)                  # optional - cryptominisat
sage: alarm(0.2); cms()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I asked #418 about the `KeyboardInterrupt`, in case somebody remembers there.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-09-30 13:31:12

The correct call is

```
raise PackageNotFoundError("cryptominisat")
```

In turns out that the word "interrupt" has a specific meaning in cryptominisat, which is unrelated to `KeyboardInterrupt`.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-09-30 20:16:13

Why the `# random`?

```
sage: solver = SAT() # random
```



---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2015-09-30 20:16:39

I would prefer this to be a lazy import:

```
from solvers.satsolver import SAT
```

About random: I wrongly believed that Cryptominisat always printed information when instanciated.

A few more details:

1. It's ugly that your ILP solver returns values as `0.0` and `1.0`. It should be converted to `True`/`False`.

2. `Its performances` -> `Its performance`

3. `cryptominisat_available = True` -> `solver = 'cryptominisat'` and `cryptominisat_available = False` -> `solver = 'LP'`. That's a lot cleaner: you can remove the `solver is None` checks.

4. Please fix the `deicison` typo also in `src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py`

Right.

Done.

> 3. `cryptominisat_available = True` -> `solver = 'cryptominisat'` and `cryptominisat_available = False` -> `solver = 'LP'`. That's a lot cleaner: you can remove the `solver is None` checks.

I'm an idiot.

> 4. Please fix the `deicison` typo also in `src/sage/sat/converters/polybori.py`

Done.
