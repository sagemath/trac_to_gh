Sage univariaty polynomials do not admit numerator and denominator by default:

```

AttributeError: 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.P' object has no attribute 'numerator'
```

The same happens for multivariate polynomials, see #6496

SAGE implements denominators for some univariate polynomial ring and numerators for sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_rational_dense

For denominators, first, it trys to compute the lcm of the denominators of the coefficients of the polynomial. If the coefficients do not have a denominator method or these denominators do not have a lcm method then the function fails with an exception.

Numerators of polynomials with rational coefficients are polynomials over the integers.

I propose to add the following methods:

1.- Change the denominator function. First try to compute the denominator as it is done now, if it fails, return a generic denominator
self.parent()_one_element()

2.- Add a numerator function returning self * self.denominator()

This will not change the cases where denominators are used.
