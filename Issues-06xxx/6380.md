Although the ntl-5.4.2.p7 package would build on Solaris 10 with gcc 4.4.0 if the gcc was configured to use the GNU linker from binutils, the package would not build with the gcc if the compiler was configured to use the Sun linker, with the following options:

--with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --without-gnu-ld 

The part of the makefile executed when building a shared library would fail if the Sun linker was used. The makefile specified the same output filename twice, but in a way the Sun linker would not tolerate. 

This patch simply removes a very small bit of code (just "-Wl,-soname,lib`cat DIRNAME`.so "), which allows NTL to build properly, irrespective of the linker that is being used.

Positive review, though I didn't test it with the Sun linker, it looks very sensible and doesn't break things.

OK, I've made the changes. 

Please see: 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/ntl-5.4.2.p9/ (different directory to last one)

I created a patchfile which shows the differences from the last copy of 'mfile' otherwise the patch would be huge and uncomprehsible, as mfile has been changed so many times. There is actually a patch in the 'patches' directory. 

I just noticed I probably put the original and new files in the wrong order, as it looks like I've added stuff to the 'mfile' not taken it away. I have in fact just *removed*   -Wl,-soname,libcat DIRNAME.so

Formally the line was:
	$(LINK_CXX) -fPIC -shared -Wl,-soname,lib`cat DIRNAME`.so -o lib`cat DIRNAME`.so $(OBJ) $(GMP_LIBDIR)

now it is 
	$(LINK_CXX) -fPIC -shared -o lib`cat DIRNAME`.so $(OBJ) $(GMP_LIBDIR) $(GMP_LIB)

After installing the NTL package at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/ntl-5.4.2.p9.spkg

and running doctests on all of the Sage library, I got this:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/modular/hecke/morphism.py # 0 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/categories/morphism.pyx # 0 doctests failed
```
The funny thing is that it reports doctest failures, with "0 doctests failed". I reinstalled `ntl-5.4.2.p8.spkg` and ran all doctests again, and they passed. I then installed **ntl-5.4.2.p9.spkg** a second time, ran all doctests, and they now passed without any of those weird "0 doctests failed".
