Generally the code looks good to me (though there is at least one functions with no doctests at present).

Once rebased, I'll test it properly.

"I wrote that code as part of an undergraduate summer research program. I was not particularly savvy with Sage development then (and even less-so now).

So I (kedlaya) took the liberty of manually rebasing the patch. I haven't even tried to build this yet; probably that will reveal some other issues.
