Attachment: **[libsingular_more_functions.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6909/libsingular_more_functions.patch.gz)**

The attached patch
* implements a Pythonic interface to the Singular options 
* fixes a bug where local orderings were not used correctly 
* switches `groebner_basis()` and `elimination_ideal()` to libsingular.

For most functions on multivariate polynomial ideals we first need to wrap libSingular lists since many functions return lists. This would require an updated SPKG.

Hi,
I spent 10 minutes reading the code and like it (this is not a formal review).
Cheers,
Michael
