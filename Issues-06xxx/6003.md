Thanks, Doug.  Yes I think this has exceeded its shelf-life.  The referenced tickets (and maybe one or two others) basically put Cholesky decomposition on a firm footing again.

I'll try to put this into the right status to get Jeroen's attention.

**Release Manager**

This can be safely marked "wontfix" or made obsolete in some other way.  Thanks.

Just for your information: it's better to also change the milestone the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix.
