<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Here's how to workaround it (namely, put "dict(constants)" instead of "constants").  In the code for `__call__` or subs, something similar should be done. 

```
sage: var('v t')
sage: f = v*t
sage: s = {v: 2}
sage: f(dict(s), t=3)
6
sage: s
{v: 2}
```
