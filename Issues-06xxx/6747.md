When one plots a tree with  `G.plot(layout='tree')`, the result is ugly.  For one thing, a tree plot should never have crossing lines.  I have code that makes a nice tree plot in nearly-linear time, which should be included in Sage.

Thanks much for improving the layout of trees!

Please have a look at #7004, which also started splitting the layout algorithms in different methods. So we need to decide on a naming convention. 

Then I guess this patch can get in, and #7400 be rebased on it.
