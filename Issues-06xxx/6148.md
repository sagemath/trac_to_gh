```
In sage-4.0.rc1 if I define:


```
sage: r(u) = floor(u) - 2*floor(u/2)
sage: s(u) = ceil(u) - 2*ceil(u/2)
```

The following gives an incorrect plot:

```
sage: plot(r, (0, 10))
```

but

```
sage: plot([r], (0, 10))
```

gives the correct plot.

For ceil it is even worse

```
sage: plot([s], (0, 10))
```

gives the correct plot, but

```
sage: plot(s, (0, 10))
```

gives a runtime error:

```
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

All of this works correctly in sage-3.4.2, so it is probably
related to the new symbolics.

Additionally

```
sage: r(0)
-2*floor(0)
```

but

```
sage: s(0)
0
```

as expected.
