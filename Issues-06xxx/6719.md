This is a report of a test failure of elliptic_eu (0.5, 0.1), seen on Sage sage-4.1.1.rc0 with updated Maxima (5.19.0) and ecl (9.8.1)

I don't understand the maths of this, and don't even know how to independently verify this. But I'm just reporting it as a test failure. I don't even know if this should be 'algebra'. Please someone set the 'Component' to something else if this is inappropriate.

Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll (Juanjo), the main developer of ECL has discovered a bug in ECL 9.8.1. On his advice, I took the CVS on August 10th 2009  and have updated just the one file. 

```
ecl-9.8.1/src/cmp/sysfun.lsp
```

This fixes the problem. 


As far as I am concerned, this, and trac #6716 (which effected elliptic_e) can now be closed. Doctest

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py"
```

now passes. 

I will produce a revised ecl .spkg file, as per trac #6564
