I do not know if you are aware of it ( I was not until very recently ) but the docstrings are used to generate a very complete documentation accessible through there :

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs.html

This also means that you can use LaTeX in your description if you deem it necessary, and that the formula will be automatically translated into beautiful equations on this page ;-)
