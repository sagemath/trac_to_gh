In order to track the build progress, it is necessary to store the start time of the build process. (elapsed time, estimate of remaining time, ...) 

This patch inserts a line in "install" which stores the seconds since 1970-1-1 in a hidden file `.BUILDSTART` in `%SAGE_ROOT` when the build process starts. This could also be useful for other applications.

Although this is marked as fixed, it should be noted that it makes use of a non-portable option to the `date` command so fails on some systems. See 

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/date.html

for a list of portable options. 

Since the file created is not actually used by anything it's not a big problem, but if anyone tried using it on a Unix system, it would likely fail. A better method is:

```
# Compute seconds since the Epoch.

# Call 'date'. Note that
# %Y = year including century
# %j = day number (1-365)
# %H = hour (0-23)
# %M = minute (0-59)
# %S = seconds (0-59)

if type env >/dev/null 2>&1 ; then
    set -- `env LC_ALL=C LC_TIME=C LANG=C date -u '+%Y %j %H %M %S'`
else
    set -- `date -u '+%Y %j %H %M %S'`
fi

# $1 = year including century
# $2 = day number (1-365)
# $3 = hour (0-23)
# $4 = minute (0-59)
# $5 = seconds (0-59)

if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ $# -lt 5 ] ; then
  TIME="Error computing seconds since the Epoch"
fi

DAYS=`expr 365 \* \( $1 - 1970 \) + \( $1 - 1969 \) / 4 + $2 - 1`
TIME=`expr $5 + 60 \* \( $4 + 60 \* \( $3 + 24 \* $DAYS \) \)`
echo $TIME
```
