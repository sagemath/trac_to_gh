1. Modify "residues" function so that it returns a canonical set of coset representatives.

2. New "reduce" function for number field ideals that returns the canonical reduced representative of a given integral element: I.reduce(f) is an element of the set of representatives returned by I.residues(). 

3. Have "inverse_mod" working for integral elements of a number field without having to coerce to the ring of integers (using existing  functionality for order elements)


Patch based on 3.4.2 to follow soon.

This is unlikely to make it into Sage 4.0, so bumping it to 4.0.1.

I fixed these things in the review patch (which also fixes a few minor documentation issues I noticed that are nothing to do with this ticket as such), but someone else should look at this too.
