1. Modify "residues" function so that it returns a canonical set of coset representatives.

2. New "reduce" function for number field ideals that returns the canonical reduced representative of a given integral element: I.reduce(f) is an element of the set of representatives returned by I.residues(). 

3. Have "inverse_mod" working for integral elements of a number field without having to coerce to the ring of integers (using existing  functionality for order elements)


Patch based on 3.4.2 to follow soon.

The patch applies fine to 4.0.alpha0, and all tests in sage/rings/number_field pass.

There are some small glitches in the docstrings:  in inverse_mod() in the first line, N should be I.  In reduce(), there is a formatting problem which I think would go away if a space is inserted after the second ` in `I`=self, and later on the single backquotes aroung small_residue should be double.  Ans some small indentation issues (which aer oly seen as problematical when docbuild is used).

I fixed these things in the review patch (which also fixes a few minor documentation issues I noticed that are nothing to do with this ticket as such), but someone else should look at this too.
