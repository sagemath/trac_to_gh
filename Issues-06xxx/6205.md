I like it. My only minor quibble is that I would add the one line "Return the inverse of self." to the docstring, even though it really adds no value whatsoever. 

So since there were no methods in that class before, and 1 now, does that mean this patch makes number field homomorphisms infniitely more useful? `:)`
