From Pat LeSmithe:

Control-enter is bound to spliteval_cell.  To make control-shift-enter, say, insert a line break, try augmenting notebook.py's tinyMCE.init()'s setup with some code ripped from the Safari plug-in:

     // Around line 1840 of sage/server/notebook/notebook.py
     setup : function(ed) {
         ed.onKeyDown.add(function(ed, e) {
             // Make ctrl-shift-enter insert a line break.  Copied from
the Safari plug-in.
             if (e.keyCode == 13 && e.shiftKey && e.ctrlKey) {
                 // Workaround for missing shift+enter support,
http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16973
                 var dom = ed.dom, s = ed.selection, r = s.getRng(), br;

                 // Insert BR element
                 r.insertNode(br = dom.create('br'));

                 // Place caret after BR
                 r.setStartAfter(br);
                 r.setEndAfter(br);
                 s.setRng(r);

                 // Could not place caret after BR then insert an nbsp
entity and move the caret
                 if (s.getSel().focusNode == br.previousSibling) {

s.select(dom.insertAfter(dom.doc.createTextNode('\u00a0'), br));
                     s.collapse(1);
                 }

                 // Scroll to new position, scrollIntoView can't be
used due to bug: http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16117
                 ed.getWin().scrollTo(0,
dom.getPos(s.getRng().startContainer).y);

                 tinymce.dom.Event.cancel(e);
             }
         });
         // Make shift-enter quit editing.  This is the "old" code.
         ed.onKeyDown.add(function(ed, e) {
             if (key_enter_shift(key_event(e))) {
                 $(ed.formElement).submit();
             }
         })
     }

This seems to work on Linux in Firefox, Opera, and the Qt 4.5 WebKit
demo browser (e.g., /usr/lib64/qt4/demos/browser/browser).

I can't give a full positive review because I don't have access to any other browsers, nor am I competent to make sure it doesn't introduce a nasty bug, but partial positive review.  The rest of a review should not be hard.

I think this ticket should be reviewed again (sorry!), since I don't have access to a Mac machine.

I think the issue here was making multi-paragraph list items.  Maybe we could just make it so that pressing control-shift-enter in a list makes a new paragraph inside of an <li>.

It really seems that there should be an easier way of doing this.  I guess we are hampered by shift-enter, ctrl-enter, and alt-enter having more global meaning.

On lists: I was working from [this sage-devel post](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/1f5658399f500c24).  The current patch should work inside lists, too. 

On simplicity:  I think many of TinyMCE's source lines are devoted to similar tricks, although they may well be far more effective.

Just let me know what I should do.
