Shorter snippet:

```
sage: var('theta1,theta2')
var('theta1,theta2')
sage: (theta1 == theta2).test_relation()
/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.0.rc1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 198:  8823 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

This doesn't have a problem:

```
sage: var('t1,t2')
(t1, t2)
sage: (t1 == t2).test_relation()
False
```

This is caused by the fact that theta1 and theta2 have the same hash (as all symbolic variables which have the same 4 characters in their name), and trying to put them as keys in a dictionary calls `__nonzero__`() and test_relation() in turn, causing an infinite loop.

```
sage: hash(theta1) == hash(theta2)
True
sage: hash(t1) == hash(t2)
False
```

This is easily fixed by reverting symbol::calchash to the original code in pynac. Since we use the symbol name for comparison in symbol::compare_same_type, this change doesn't effect the printing order. However, it makes the hash values random.

I can't see anything wrong with having random hash values. Are there any objections to this?

New pynac package here reverts to the original `symbol::calchash` and fixes this issue:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.8.spkg

Attached patch makes the necessary doctest changes.

The new package also contains a fix for #6144, so these tickets should be merged together.
