<a id='comment:1'></a>Shorter snippet:

```
sage: var('theta1,theta2')
var('theta1,theta2')
sage: (theta1 == theta2).test_relation()
/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.0.rc1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 198:  8823 Segmentation fault      sage-ipython "$@" -i
```

This doesn't have a problem:

```
sage: var('t1,t2')
(t1, t2)
sage: (t1 == t2).test_relation()
False
```

This is caused by the fact that theta1 and theta2 have the same hash (as all symbolic variables which have the same 4 characters in their name), and trying to put them as keys in a dictionary calls `__nonzero__`() and test_relation() in turn, causing an infinite loop.

```
sage: hash(theta1) == hash(theta2)
True
sage: hash(t1) == hash(t2)
False
```
