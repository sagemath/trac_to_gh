    205

    207         if operator is None:

arctan2(real_part(y) + imag_part(x), real_part(x) - imag_part(y))


Both of these fail because Sage doesn't define a symbolic arctan2
function. There is instead a simple wrapper around arctan in
sage/functions/trig.py:

sage: arctan2(x,y)
arctan(x/y)

```

It's possible that this worked on 4.0, and I broke it with #6244.

Okay, this seems to fix everything and passes tests on trig.py and symbolic/expression.py and /function.py.    I made the function consistent with Maxima, Pynac, and Python math.  Only issue, which I would really appreciate some insight on but should not prevent it from going in, is the following:

```
sage: latex(arctan2)
\arctan
sage: var('y')
y
sage: latex(arctan2(y,x))
\mbox{atan2}\left(y,x\right)
```
Of course, this doesn't fix the question about plotting, but now the failure on that will be clearer.

Looks good, thanks for this.

I added a small patch with doctest fixes in `sage/symbolic/random_tests.py`.
