Attachment: **[trac_6183.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6183/trac_6183.patch.gz)**


```
sage: B.<i, j, k> = QuaternionAlgebra(RR, -1, -1) 
sage: latex(i + 1 - k) 
1.00000000000000 + i - k
```

With all due respect, this is hideous :-) I know you only did it for consistency with the `repr` method, of course; but what would you say to the suggestion that we change `repr`, and `latex`, so they return something like `1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*i - 1.00000000000000*k`? This is consistent with our conventions for other algebras over inexact rings (e.g. polynomials and power series).

Point taken.

I'm changing this to "needs work".  I'll try to find an elegant way of using the printing code for polynomials so that things are consistent (and stay that way).

Actually, note that printing of polynomials is *not* consistent, in that multivariable polynomials have "hideous" printing, whereas univariate ones have "pretty" printing:

```
sage: R.<i, j, k> = RR[]
sage: i + 1 - k
i - k + 1.00000000000000
sage: R.<i> = RR[[]]
sage: i+1
1.00000000000000 + 1.00000000000000*i
```

So this needs fixing.
