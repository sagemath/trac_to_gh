REFEREE REPORT



The patch `trac_6011.patch` applies OK against the "post-final" version sage-3.4.2, all doctests pass with the options `-t -long`, and the doctest coverage is now 100% as claimed. Note that `sage/plot/arrow.py` is not included in the reference manual, so you can't search for it in order to view the documentation for `sage/plot/arrow.py`.



The patch adds some trivial inconsistencies in how "two-dimensional" and "three-dimensional" are abbreviated. These and other inconsistencies are fixed in the reviewer patch `trac_6011-reviewer.patch`. Apart from the issue of consistency throughout the whole module, positive review for kcrisman's patch. Only my patch needs to be reviewed.
