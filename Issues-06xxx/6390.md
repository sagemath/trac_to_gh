As of 4.0.2 we only have elliptic logs for curves defined over the reals (including curves over number fields with a real embedding).  We also need the complex case, which can be implemented using the complex AGM.  I expect to be adding this during June/July 2009.

The patch implements complex elliptic logs as promised, and makes a few minor improvements to the periods & elliptic log code generally.

The new code works fine for real embeddings too, and is almost as fast:  for the database curves up to conductor 1000 (and with the optional database installed so that all generators are pre-installed) the new code takes 183 seconds to find all logs of all generators (for the optimal curves) while the old code takes 154s.  The new code is also rather simpler.  I have left in the old code.  Reviewers wishing to test this can do so by switching lines 1243 and 1244 of period_lattice.py: doctests almost all succeed, with a tiny amount of fuzz in some elliptic exponential computations.

I am CC'ing rlm since after installing the optional database of curves (and generators) and testing all of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, I found that there were some failures in heegner.py, mainly caused by E.gens() sometimes now producing different generators.  I fixed almost all of these (since I think that as a matter of principle these doctests should not be dependent on the database not being installed!) but there are two I cannot fix (lines 1409 and 1415 of heegner.py) and I am hoping that Robert M will be able to.

The following change fixes this, but I can't vouch for its advisability.
