As of 4.0.2 we only have elliptic logs for curves defined over the reals (including curves over number fields with a real embedding).  We also need the complex case, which can be implemented using the complex AGM.  I expect to be adding this during June/July 2009.

The patch implements complex elliptic logs as promised, and makes a few minor improvements to the periods & elliptic log code generally.

The new code works fine for real embeddings too, and is almost as fast:  for the database curves up to conductor 1000 (and with the optional database installed so that all generators are pre-installed) the new code takes 183 seconds to find all logs of all generators (for the optimal curves) while the old code takes 154s.  The new code is also rather simpler.  I have left in the old code.  Reviewers wishing to test this can do so by switching lines 1243 and 1244 of period_lattice.py: doctests almost all succeed, with a tiny amount of fuzz in some elliptic exponential computations.

I am CC'ing rlm since after installing the optional database of curves (and generators) and testing all of sage/schemes/elliptic_curves, I found that there were some failures in heegner.py, mainly caused by E.gens() sometimes now producing different generators.  I fixed almost all of these (since I think that as a matter of principle these doctests should not be dependent on the database not being installed!) but there are two I cannot fix (lines 1409 and 1415 of heegner.py) and I am hoping that Robert M will be able to.

The following change fixes this, but I can't vouch for its advisability.

I wanted to review it, then I noticed from a problem in the documentation that the first patch has many tabulators in it. Unfortunately, I can not just replace all tabs by 4 spaces in the patch as then it makes a mess out of the code. So I guess that John can do the replacement faster than me.

(Most editors allow the setting that all tabulators are replaces by 4 spaces automatically, this would avoid these problems automatically.)

It is a shame that the tabs are not visible here.

I uploaded a new patch that incorporates the previous two changes, switches the tabs to spaces and also solves the two remaining doctest problems in heegner.py (using random and only testing the squares, admittedly ugly), and it fixes a problem in the documentation (a missing ::).

I start testing now. Unless the author claims that I made an error in the indentation of the new patch (when removing the tabs), I will give it a positive review after the test.
