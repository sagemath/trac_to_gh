As of 4.0.2 we only have elliptic logs for curves defined over the reals (including curves over number fields with a real embedding).  We also need the complex case, which can be implemented using the complex AGM.  I expect to be adding this during June/July 2009.

March 2010:  it was clearly a mistake to put in a time estimate.  We now have a preprint explaining all the relevant theory:

J. E. Cremona and T. Thongjunthug, "On computing complex elliptic logarithms" (provisional title) 

which I am now going to implement i nSage (my coauthor has already implemented it in Magma).

The following change fixes this, but I can't vouch for its advisability.

(Most editors allow the setting that all tabulators are replaces by 4 spaces automatically, this would avoid these problems automatically.)

It is a shame that the tabs are not visible here.

I uploaded a new patch that incorporates the previous two changes, switches the tabs to spaces and also solves the two remaining doctest problems in heegner.py (using random and only testing the squares, admittedly ugly), and it fixes a problem in the documentation (a missing ::).

I start testing now. Unless the author claims that I made an error in the indentation of the new patch (when removing the tabs), I will give it a positive review after the test.

Many thanks, Chris, and sorry for not responding earlier but I was on holiday for a few days.

Sorry too for the tab/space issue.  I just don't see to be able to set up emacs correctly on all the machines I use... but I'll try not to do it again.
