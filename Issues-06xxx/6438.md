At the very least, native complex support will be valuable. 

The spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/ built and passed all doctests a couple of versions back.

The SPKG at

doesn't contain a file called `.hgignore` like the current version in Sage 4.1. So when one executes the command

```
hg status
```
one sees a lot of source files. I've added a `.hgignore` file to the repository of that SPKG. The updated SPKG is up at
