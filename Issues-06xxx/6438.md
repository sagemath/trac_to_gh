The spkg at http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/ built and passed all doctests a couple of versions back.

I don't see anything in SPKG.txt that needs changing--the changelog would be pretty boring if it was there ("Upgraded to version x.y.z" * 100).

The SPKG at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/cython-0.11.2.1.spkg

doesn't contain a file called `.hgignore` like the current version in Sage 4.1. So when one executes the command

```
hg status
```
one sees a lot of source files. I've added a `.hgignore` file to the repository of that SPKG. The updated SPKG is up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/cython-0.11.2.1.spkg

All doctests passed with the latter SPKG and `6438-cython.patch`.
