I added features in the category of group algebras (especially linked to the center).

Moreover, the symmetric group algebra now is a parent of this category.

Note : I have folded it with a previous patch on the same features, so look at the new version of the file (sorry, I should have worked on the same patch since the beginning)

Apply [attachment: group_algebras_feature_central_vf.v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6654/group_algebras_feature_central_vf.v2.patch.gz)

Keywords: **group algebra, center**

Reviewer: **Frédéric Chapoton**
