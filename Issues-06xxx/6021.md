For elliptic curves over number fields we currently only support the period lattice for real embeddings.  here we will implement the same for complex embeddings too (using the complex AGM method to compute the basis).

**Assignee:** @williamstein

**CC:**  @robertwb

**Keywords:** elliptic curve periods

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** John Cremona

**Reviewer:** Robert Bradshaw

**Merged:** 4.0.1.rc0

The patch does what was proposed.

I added an is_real() method to mpfr reals (returning True of course) also, for convenience.

Unsurprisingly this causes a bunch of numerical noise problems:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_point.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/rational_field.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice.py # 11 doctests failed
```
Some of them are quite disturbing:

```
File "/scratch/mabshoff/sage-4.0.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/period_lattice.py", line 439:
    sage: Ls[2]._compute_periods_complex(100)
Expected:
    (1.9072648860892726204877126889 - 1.3404778596244020430694806590*I,
    -1.9072648860892726204877126889 - 1.3404778596244020430694806590*I)
Got:
    (-1.9072648860892727038846028695 - 1.3404778596244020695699736749*I,
     -1.9072648860892727038846028695 + 1.3404778596244020695699736749*I)
```
I.e. notice that for the real part above **11** digits are different.

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

Good question.

I knew we use pari for complex agm and had assumed we also did for real agm.  I suggest that first we implement complex agm in native Sage, to remove that variable.

Here are the steps:  

1. compute 2-division poly over the number field (exact)
2. embed the coeffs into RR or CC (depends on the embedding precision)
3. find its roots in RR or CC (depends on precision)
4. compute some square roots (ditto)
5. compute some AGMs
6. take reciprocals and multiply by pi

What should be done is to find out exactly at what point things differ.

OK, so I have added two new patches:  embed_qqbar.patch is independent of the others, and adds functionality to the refine_embedding() function for embeddings of number fields to allow extending any embedding into RR or CC to an embedding into AA or QQbar (choosing the correct root).  Then cperiods.patch uses that to rethink how precision is handled for period lattices (real and complex):  the embedding supplied by the user is only used to determine which embedding is wanted, not its precision (which is ignored).  the lattice converts this (on construction) into an embedding into AA or QQbar, which it keeps.  Then the period-finding functions do as much as they can exactly (i.e. in AA or QQbar), up as far as computing sqrt(ei-ej) where e1,e2,e3 are the roots of the 2-division polynomial (so these expressions may have degree 6* the degree of the field);  only then are they converted into RR or CC (with the correct precision) for the transcendental step of computing AGMs.

To test this I removed the "..." which worried robertwb and reran the doctests -- they now all pass and agree on both 32 and 64-bit machines.

I think this is a good strategy to use for number field embeddings (a.k.a. infinite places): separate the information "which place" from the information "what precision".

If this is approved, I will use the same tactic to improve the precision of the elliptic log (since the next thing on this agenda is to implement complex elliptic logs).

Yet another patch, to be applied after the previous ones.

1. Better handling of precision.  The algebraic quantities needed for both periods and elliptic logs are now cached.  Then period and log computations just have to coerce into the appropriate Real/ComplexField, and do the transcendental part via agm.
2. Elliptic log implementation now moved into period lattice class (except for the algorithm="pari" case which is unchanged).  Also available via call i.e. as L.elliptic_logarithm(P) or just L(P).  Uses an extended agm function which has been separated off.
3. Earlier precision issues with a difficult example are fixed;  we get all the same digits as pari, and faster.  To do this we compute the extended AGM in double the required precision and then revert to desired precision at the end.  (I tried adding 10 or 20 bits of precision, but that nasty example (18074g1) needs more).

The only remaining thing is to implement elliptic logs for non-real lattices.  This is not hard to do but harder to justify!  Before I do that, to test it  I need to implement the reverse of the elliptic log -- using Weierstrass P-functions and derivative to go from z mod L back to P(x,y) with complex coords in general.

Apologies for adding this after a positive review (which applies to the first three patches only).  So: the first 3 patches have a positive review, while the 4th does not (yet).
