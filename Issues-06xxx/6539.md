Thommy Malmstrom, thommy.m.malmstrom@gmail.com reported a problem to me with a failed build of Sage on an OpenSolaris (AMD or Intel processor).

```
Host system
uname -a:
SunOS bigblue 5.11 snv_101b i86pc i386 i86pc Solaris
```
What can be seen in the configure script's output is the linker is determined to be the GNU linker:

```
checking for ld used by gcc -std=gnu99... ld
checking if the linker (ld) is GNU ld... yes
```

But this is incorrect, as the output from the compiler shows:

```
Configured with: /builds2/sfwnv-gate/usr/src/cmd/gcc/gcc-3.4.3/configure
--prefix=/usr/sfw --with-as=/usr/sfw/bin/gas --with-gnu-as
--with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld --without-gnu-ld
--enable-languages=c,c++,f77,objc --enable-shared
Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.4.3 (csl-sol210-3_4-20050802)
```

The error is a result of sending the -soname to the Sun linker, which generates an error - clearly this is nothing like you would expect from a GNU tool, and is the Sun linker:

```
usage: ld [-6:abc:d:e:f:h:il:mo:p:rstu:z:B:CD:F:GI:L:M:N:P:Q:R:S:VW:Y:?]
file(s)
        [-64]           enforce a 64-bit link-edit
        [-a]            create an absolute file
        [-b]            do not do special PIC relocations in a.out
        [-B direct | nodirect]
                        establish direct bindings, or inhibit direct binding
                        to, the object being created
        [-B dynamic | static]
                        search for shared libraries|archives
        [-B eliminate]  eliminate unqualified global symbols from the
                        symbol table
        [-B group]      relocate object from within group
        [-B local]      reduce unqualified global symbols to local

```
I've attached the part of the log connected with the building of mpir. 

The configure script was generated using autoconf 2.61, which is about (Nov 2006), so is around two and a half years old. It might be that the old version does not perform too well on OpenSolaris, so I would suggest a later version is used to generate the configure script.

I've just tried to build mpir on what I believe is the same OS as above - the 11/2008 release of OpenSolaris and do not see this issue - the configure  script reconises this as a non-GNU linker properly. It is not clear why it should get it wrong on another system with the same OS

```
$ cat /etc/release
                       OpenSolaris 2008.11 snv_101b_rc2 X86
           Copyright 2008 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.
                        Use is subject to license terms.
                           Assembled 19 November 2008
```


Here's the output of configure of mpir-1.2.p4

```
./configure 
<SNIP>
checking for a sed that does not truncate output... /usr/bin/gsed
checking for ld used by gcc -std=gnu99... /usr/ccs/bin/ld
checking if the linker (/usr/ccs/bin/ld) is GNU ld... no
checking for /usr/ccs/bin/ld option to reload object files... -r

```
