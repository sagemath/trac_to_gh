With sage-4.0.alpha0:

```
sage: kronecker(2/3,7)
...
TypeError: no conversion of this rational to integer
```
Same for `kronecker_symbol` and `legendre_symbol`. However, it does make sense for these to be defined on rationals.

This is actually used by `is_padic_square` when used with rationals, and triggered by some of the new quadratic form doctests.
