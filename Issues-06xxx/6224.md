This is after the cache is warm, otherwise it's even worse: 

```
Robert-Bradshaws-Laptop:~/sage robert$ echo "" | time sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.0, Release Date: 2009-05-29                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: referee
sage: sage: 
Exiting SAGE (CPU time 0m0.08s, Wall time 0m0.17s).
        2.58 real         1.23 user         1.19 sys

```

We need to go through and audit the startup imports again.
