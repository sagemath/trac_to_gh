Building the documentation for 4.1.alpha2, there is a warning:

```
WARNING: /home/david/sage-4.1.alpha2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/abstract_method.py:docstring of sage.misc.abstract_method.abstract_method:19: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
```
This is due to a rogue "::" in a docstring introduced by #6097.
