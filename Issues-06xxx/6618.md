The point is that tightpage crops if the picture is small, but also does *not* crop to the page size if the picture is big.
In other words, it really sets the page size to be the size of the picture.

I have a apparently working patch. I still need to test it further and document it this time :-)

I think that tightpage should impose pdflatex = True, because producing badly cropped images is bad.  One other comment (for now -- I may have more later): in line 1264

```diff
 	1261	    if tightpage: 
 	1262	        title = '' 
 	1263	        extra_preamble += '\\usepackage[tightpage,active]{preview}\\PreviewEnvironment{page}' 
 	1264	        math_left  = '\\begin{page}$\displaystyle' 
 	1265	        math_right = '$\\end{page}' 
```
add a space after "displaystyle".  On my computer:

```
sage: CB = CrystalOfLetters(['B',2]) 
sage: latex(CB)
dot2tex not available.  Install after running 'sage -sh'
dot2tex not available.  Install after running 'sage -sh'
None
```
Since `latex(CB)` returns `None`, then when I try 

```
sage: view(CB, tightpage = True)
```
it forms a latex document containing

```
\begin{page}$\displaystyleNone$\end{page}
```
This leads to an error.  A space after "displaystyle" would fix this.

Two more comments, and otherwise I think this looks okay: first, it needs to be rebased against 4.3.3 (alpha0 or later), because of #8219.  Second, the issue with the cropped images seems to be the fault of "convert": if you create a dvi file using tightpage, say by using "debug=True" in the view command and cutting and pasting the latex, and then if you run dvips on it, then run 

```
convert -density 150x150 -trim test.ps test.png
```
it's badly cropped.  The postscript file is actually okay: if you run ps2pdf on it, the pdf file looks good.  So maybe it's a bug in "convert"?

For a future ticket: should we consider changing the default so that pdflatex is True rather than False?

On my OS X machine, running doctests opens up an external viewer for PDF files. Also, doctests fail because I don't have dot2tex installed (this is easy to fix). For the external viewer issue, maybe we should just rip out these doctests:

Other suggestions?

I also still some cropping issues in the notebook, say with this code:

```
g = graphs.BidiakisCube()
latex.add_to_jsmath_avoid_list('tikz')
view(g, tightpage=True)
```
But maybe that's not a big deal.
