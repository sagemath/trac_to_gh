A quick comment: denominator should return the right "1", I guess the one in the base ring `self.base_ring()(1)` or the parent `sage.parent()(1)`.

I sent the original patch. I have realized that SAGE does neither implement numerator and denominator for univariate polynomials in general. I have open a ticket with patches in #6541 so maybe is better to wait until that patch is accepted to review this one.

I have written a new patch trying to be compatible to the univariate case.

a new function denominator in MPolynomial:

1.- First it tries to compute the lcm of the denominators of the coefficients. Returns this computation as result.

2.- If it cannot compute the previous denominator, returns a generic denominator. self.parent().one_element()

a new function numerator in MPolynomial:

returns self * self.denominator()

In the univariate case there is a special case, the numerator of a polynomial with rational coefficients QQ['x'] in a polynomial with integer coefficients ZZ['x'] So I have added another patch to MPolynomial_libsingular.

3.- If the base ring of the polynomial is the field of rational numbers, the numerator is coerced to the ring of multivariate polynomials over the integers, with the same variables and same ordering as self.parent()
