Nice work; thanks for doing this!

Marking as "needs work" for the following reasons:

* Doctests which rely on internet should be marked "optional - requires internet"
* image_convert should probably let me specify an output file name, or by default write in the current directory so that we can use it easily in the notebook (e.g., we convert something and it magically appears in the cell output).
* someone should test this on a mac and then remove the note about it not being tested on a mac
* stylistically, it looks like there is lots of duplicated code that opens files from the internet; maybe this could be refactored into a single function (and then used for image_convert as well)?

I will try to work on these referee comments/suggestions now. It probably needs rebasing anyway.
