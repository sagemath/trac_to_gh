Background: Some months ago, we upgraded from gap 4.4.10 to gap 4.4.12 (gap 4.4.11 was skipped due to some technical problems). This
caused some docstrings to break, since some of gap's print methods were changed.

The patch at 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap-4.4.12.p0.spkg
will also break some docstrings. However, it applies fine (using sage -f) to sage 4.0.2.rc1. 

A patch fixing the breaks will be posted later.

First do 
sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wdj/patches/gap-4.4.12.p0.spkg
This will cause several (minor) docstring test failures. All are fixed in this patch,
which passes sage -testall.

By the way, the best way to fix a patch is to use Mercurial queues. First, you use `hg qimport` to import the patch, then `hg qpush` to get it in the queue. Rebuild, edit, do whatever you like, and then you can use `hg qrefresh` to incorporate the changes into the patch, and `hg export tip > filename.patch` to get the new patch, and finally `hg qpop` if you want the patch back off the queue again.

I had no problem on an amd64 ubuntu 9.04 machine and likewise for an intel macbook running 10.4.11.

I tried to build sage 4.1 from source on sage.math and ran into some compiling errors. Can you tell me what version of sage you used on sage.math?

Patches to the Sage library don't belong in spkgs-- but this is gone in `gap-4.4.12.p1`.

My guess is that you can reproduce this behavior on sage.math as follows:

Install a fresh `sage-4.1`, and when it is finished, run the full doctest suite on long. This will guarantee that `gap-4.4.10` gets used nontrivially. Then upgrade to `gap-4.4.12.p1`. Run the doctests again.

If I copy over a sage-4.1 install and run long doctests, after having successfully used gap-4.4.12, the gap-4.4.10 in there has problems which look just like the problems I had going the other way:

It looks like this happens whenever the version of GAP used is changed. This is why I was hinting at temp files and workspaces before. Something is ringing a bell, about GAP failing to reset its own workspace on upgrade.

Hmm, after doing the above, upgrading went just fine. I just can't reproduce the `AssertionError`, even though I've seen it on Linux and OS X. Maybe it's because of the state of my `DOT_SAGE` directories.

I'm almost ready to give this a positive review, but it makes me uneasy, since it seems each user will experience this once on upgrade, possibly even if they've just installed a new version from scratch...
