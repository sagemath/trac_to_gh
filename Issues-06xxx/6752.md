At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/86d0d032eac5a840) thread, it was reported that once a Sage script is loaded into a running Sage session, then one cannot locate the corresponding generated Python script. We need to make it clear in [this section](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/programming.html#loading-and-attaching-sage-files) of the tutorial that the generated Python script can be found under the hidden directory `$HOME/.sage`.
