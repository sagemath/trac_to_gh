This completes in a fraction of a second:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order="lex")
sage: ideal(a^16,a-b^16,b-c^16,c-d^15).interreduced_basis()
[d^61440, c - d^15, b - d^240, a - d^3840]
```

I stopped the following after more than an hour, which leads me to believe that Sage is stuck in an infinite loop:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order="lex")
sage: ideal(a^16,a-b^16,b-c^16,c-d^16).interreduced_basis()
```

The only difference between the two is that the power of d in the input binomial involving c as the initial term is increased from 15 to 16. This difference has no mathematical significance and should have no impact on the computation time.

I suspect that the reason is that by default Sage uses Singular to implement interreduced_basis, and Singular has limitations on the size of exponents. See http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/latest/sing_343.htm#SEC384 which in particular says

```
the maximal allowed exponent of a ring variable depends on the ordering of the ring and is at least 32767.
```

In this case increasing the exponent from 15 to 16 makes the output have an exponent of 16<sup>4</sup>=2<sup>16</sup>=65536, while leaving it at 15 puts it just a bit below that, allowing to contain it within a 16 bit integer.
