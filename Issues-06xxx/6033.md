This patch brings coverage to 100% for plot/disk.py, clarifies that disk really means sector/wedge of a circle, and adds a plot3d method for disks.

Positive review of referee patch; jason, can you review this final patch which makes a couple things more clear (e.g. if someone tried to plot the first example without using thickness and then view it, they might get confused, 2nd example should keep color since that is part of the subplot rendering, etc.)?  

Then apply all four patches once reviewed.  I had some trouble attaching the last one, so if there are two identical ones with the same name only use one of them!
