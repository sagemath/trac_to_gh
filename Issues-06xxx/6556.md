I think it would be helpful for users if the info on the notebook
Help link was more organized. Here is a suggestion to group
topics, especially about key bindings, to make them easier to
find.

A few questions:

I changed "Delete Cell" form ctrl-backspace to backspace. Is there
any reason not to?

The < and > indentation bindings do not work form me in firefox
3.0.13 (tab and shift-tab do).

I added Comment/Uncomment Blocks bindings. Which bindings are
preferred, ctrl-./ctrl-, or ctrl-3/ctrl-4 ?
