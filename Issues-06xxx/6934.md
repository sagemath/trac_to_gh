From sage-devel [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4f39037d7fd17133](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/4f39037d7fd17133) we have the following:

```
sage: A=matrix(SR,[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]) 
sage: A.eigenvectors_right() 
Traceback (most recent call last): 
... 
TypeError: degree() takes exactly one argument (0 given)
```
As it turns out, there are a HOST of things you can't do with A because of the new symbolics, which no one has yet implemented.  Another example:

```
sage: A = matrix(SR, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
sage: A.charpoly()
(x - 1)*((x - 9)*(x - 5) - 48) - 29*x - 3
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: B = matrix(QQ, [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
sage: B.charpoly()
x^3 - 15*x^2 - 18*x
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_rational_dense'>
```
which means minpoly does not work (because it requires a polynomial, not an expression) and so on. 

These were not caught before because these things were not tested, since they weren't actually implemented in the dense symbolic matrix file.

Several things need to be done:

1. Documentation for the function needs to be written.

2. doctests need to be run in Sage to check to make sure something didn't break.

To apply the patch, you can follow the instructions in the Sage Developer's guide.

Hi Jason,

I can't get this to finish on a non-trivial 3x3 matrix.

9 different variables:  100 minutes, 2 GB memory used, killed my system

3x3 `VanderMonde` matrix, with one variable per row (each row is the 0, 1, 2 powers of the variable).  I killed it after 5 minutes.

So, yes, this would be nice for completeness, but seems of very limited value.  Do you (or anybody reading this) have any bigger, more interesting examples that actually finish?

The characteristic polynomial of a symbolic matrix can be computed quite quickly.  I don't imagine there is a good way to factor such a thing, though?

Rob
