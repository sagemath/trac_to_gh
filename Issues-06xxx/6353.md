At present, a user cannot log into two different notebooks at the same address with different ports.  For example, if I run two notebooks at

http://sage.math.washington.edu:8001

and

http://sage.math.washington.edu:8002

then I can only use one at a time unless I use two separate browsers.  A simple change to the cookies should fix this.
