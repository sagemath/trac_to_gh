Things are failing early on, with the roots command.  E.g.:

sage: var('a, d')
sage: ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots()
[(x, 1)]

While the eigenvalues method works, it doesn't compute multiplicities, so I am not sure what the easiest fix is.

I agree that the symbolic ring is inexact, and that Jordan normal form requires exactness...

What is failing here? In order to get the expected answer you need of course to specify the variable

```
sage: var('a d')
(a, d)
sage:  ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots()
[(x, 1)]
sage:  ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots(x)
[(d, 1), (a, 1)]
sage:  ((d - x)**2).roots()
[(x, 2)]
```

Here is a straightforward implementation of `jordan_form()` for symbolic matrices using Maxima.  Even though the "symbolic ring" is considered to be inexact, it still seems useful to have a working `jordan_form()` method for it.

The Jordan normal form does not require more "exactness" from the ring as do the eigenvalues which are already implemented for symbolic matrices (calling maxima). Hence I see no point in discussing whether or not we should offer a jordan_form method for symbolic matrices, it seems natural to do it as what is proposed here.

Just one thing: to be consistent with what is returned over other coefficient domains, the Jordan form should display the subdivision of the block matrix.

  ```python
  sage: a = matrix(QQ,3,[1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1])
  sage: a.jordan_form()
  [2|0 0]
  [-+---]
  [0|1 1]
  [0|0 1]
  ```
