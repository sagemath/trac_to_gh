Things are failing early on, with the roots command.  E.g.:

sage: var('a, d')
sage: ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots()
[(x, 1)]

While the eigenvalues method works, it doesn't compute multiplicities, so I am not sure what the easiest fix is.

What is failing here? In order to get the expected answer you need of course to specify the variable

```
sage: var('a d')
(a, d)
sage:  ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots()
[(x, 1)]
sage:  ((d - x)*(a - x)).roots(x)
[(d, 1), (a, 1)]
sage:  ((d - x)**2).roots()
[(x, 2)]
```

The Jordan normal form does not require more "exactness" from the ring as do the eigenvalues which are already implemented for symbolic matrices (calling maxima). Hence I see no point in discussing whether or not we should offer a jordan_form method for symbolic matrices, it seems natural to do it as what is proposed here.

Just one thing: to be consistent with what is returned over other coefficient domains, the Jordan form should display the subdivision of the block matrix.

  ```python
  sage: a = matrix(QQ,3,[1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1])
  sage: a.jordan_form()
  [2|0 0]
  [-+---]
  [0|1 1]
  [0|0 1]
  ```
