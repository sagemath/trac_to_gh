```
Change documentation of the notebook to a uniform format and complete notebook doctest/documentation coverage.

* Some docstrings are improperly formatted.
* The formatting of docstrings is inconsistent, e.g.:

Some have:

```
Output: footype

Description
```

While others have:

```
Output:

- footype -- description
```

etc.

I think there is some "overlap" here with version 2 of the patch at #5360.  But that patch makes only a few changes to `notebook.py`.  To avoid merge conflicts, should I put them in a separate patch or bring them here?

Version 3 adds *lots* of small changes to `introspect.py`, `misc.py`, `docHTMLProcessor.py`, `interact.py`, `notebook.py`, `template.py`, and `support.py`.  

Topics: missing docstrings, directives, blank lines, bullet points, headings; other inconsistencies; Sphinx warnings; etc.  The doctests pass, apart the known problem with randomly ordered tests in `worksheet.py`.

I apologize for stepping on any toes.  There may still be other problems, besides those I just introduced.  Prepping `server/` for the reference manual is tedious, but the docstrings do appear to render somewhat more nicely now, especially those in `interact.py`.

Please feel free to make more changes.  Or we can just put this up for review and fix the remaining quirks as we find them.

Version 4 adds docstrings and doctests for `cell.py` except for 2 functions: one of which is a hack (`doc_html`), and the other I have no idea how to test (`stop_interacting`).

I'll put this up for review, and we can work on the rest of the documentation another time (unless you want to add some more now?).

I'm marking this as "needs work", since at least the doctest failure must be resolved. The warnings from building the reference manual can be addressed via another ticket. However, it would be nice if both of these issues could be fixed here.

v6 changes:

* Fixed `INPUT::` in `template.py`.
* Removed the space immediately after `:meth:` in two places in `cell.py`.
* Removed `config.py` from `notebook.rst`, since there's no significant documentation yet on notebook key bindings.

That's impressive coverage for `cell.py`!  It seems that `Cell.stop_interacting()` isn't even called in the Sage library.

The updated reviewer patch also addresses this issue.

I don't know.

That's a good idea. Document what works and what doesn't. I usually have a "TESTS:" section for a method/function/class where I document exceptions that could be raised when using that method/function/class.
