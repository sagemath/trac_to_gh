The top-level `index.html` for Sage documentation now includes links to the corresponding PDF files (cf. #4460).  However, it can be useful to suppress these links.  Building on #6187, this ticket adds an option `--no-pdf-links` to `sage -docbuild`.

See #4460 for some history and an earlier version.

Looks good to me: running "sage -docbuild website html --no-pdf-links" turns the links off, and then running "sage -docbuild website html" turns them back on again.
