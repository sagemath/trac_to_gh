The function cartesian_product_iterator (which takes a list of iterators as input) gets the wrong answer when given an empty list. It returns an empty list; but the cartesian product of an empty list of iterators should be *the list containing the empty tuple*. 

The current behaviour means as a consequence that listing the elements of the zero finitely-presented module returns an empty list, rather than [0] which is clearly the right answer.
