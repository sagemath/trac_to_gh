Lines 134-135 have a line break which shouldn't be there.

At the end, is it worth giving brief descriptions of what these do?

```

Or do you think it's clear enough without that?

Other than that, I think it looks pretty good.

Regarding kcrisman's comment about doctesting, this file doesn't contain anything which gets doctested: run "sage -t -verbose -long" on it.

I don't know how to reproduce that error. With Sage 4.1.1, I got this:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/games/sudoku.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/games/sudoku.py"
         [4.9 s]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.9 seconds
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ sage -t devel/sage/sage/games/sudoku.py

    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/sage/tmp/tmp'
```
With Sage 4.1.2.alpha1, I got this:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.2.alpha1]$ ./sage -t devel/sage/sage/games/sudoku.py
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/games/sudoku.py"
         [5.4 s]

    mkdir(name, mode)

```
In both cases, using a system-wide Sage resulted in permission error.

Yes, if you're using a local Sage installation, not a system-wide one:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ cd devel/sage-main/sage/games/
[mvngu@sage games]$ ls
all.py    __init__.py         sudoku_backtrack.pyx
hexad.py  sudoku_backtrack.c  sudoku.py
[mvngu@sage games]$ pwd

Overall, it's looking good.  I have a few more comments and questions.

Replying to [@sagetrac-mvngu](#comment%3A5):
> I don't know how to reproduce that error.

Try using a version of Sage for which you have all the necessary permissions, and doctest a file outside of the Sage library by specifying a path name including slashes:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ ./sage -t ../testing/junk.py
```
or

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ ./sage -t [path to sage-4.0]/devel/sage/sage/algebras/steenrod_algebra.py
```
Does that give you an error?

Maybe my point is that "sage -t" is inconsistent: it can accept a filename within the current directory, or it can accept a pathname if that path points to a location within the Sage library (can it accept any such path?), but it won't accept a path which includes directories pointing outside of the Sage library.  This throws me off all the time, and I don't think I even knew the pattern until writing this.  I'm not even sure that I have it right.  Since inconsistencies are confusing, perhaps this could be mentioned, or the allowable file- and/or path-name arguments to `sage -t` described.

Along these lines, do you want cross-references between this new chapter and the section on "Automated Testing" in conventions.rst?

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A6):
> Try using a version of Sage for which you have all the necessary permissions, and doctest a file outside of the Sage library by specifying a path name including slashes:


```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ ./sage -t ../testing/junk.py
```
> or


```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1]$ ./sage -t [path to sage-4.0]/devel/sage/sage/algebras/steenrod_algebra.py
```
> Does that give you an error?

Yes, it did.





> Maybe my point is that "sage -t" is inconsistent: it can accept a filename within the current directory, or it can accept a pathname if that path points to a location within the Sage library (can it accept any such path?), but it won't accept a path which includes directories pointing outside of the Sage library.

I added a little explanation at the start on the general syntax to use for doctesting. It doesn't cover all cases, but I think it should cover cases where someone wants to do basic doctesting. There is now a new section called "Beyond the Sage library" that explains the limited support for doctesting modules outside of the Sage library.





> Along these lines, do you want cross-references between this new chapter and the section on "Automated Testing" in conventions.rst?

Done.
