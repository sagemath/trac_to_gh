The result is similar to that expected, but not identical. I tried this in Mathematica 7.0 too, but using 1/2 instead of 0.5, and 1/10 instead of 0.1. Then asked for the result with 50 digits of precision. 

```

```


I know it would be unwise to trust Mathematica fully, but the Mathematica result does agree much more closely with what the doctest is expecting than it does the answer on Solaris. The difference between the answer from Mathematica and that from Sage on Solaris is -0.000210294 or around 0.04%.

Just to add a few more comments.

Juanjo, the main developer of ECL has discovered a bug in ECL 9.8.1, which was effecting both elliptic_e and elliptic_eu. A patch, which corrects both this and #6719 can be found on #6719 


As far as I am concerned, this, and trac #6719 (which effected elliptic_eu) can now be closed. Doctest

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py"
```

now passes. 

I will produce a revised ecl .spkg file, as per trac #6564
