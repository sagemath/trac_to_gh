Jinja is a templating engine based on Django's. It's already included
in Sage due to the inclusion of Sphinx. Migrating from HTML to
templates should make it easier to make future changes to the code,
and make things easier to read.

Additionally, this will give us the option of switching to a web framework such as Django.

timdumol: There should be a proper username on the patch. At the moment I see this

```
# User deadlyx@localhost.localdomain
```
The username should not be a leet handle or anything like that. In order to properly credit contributors to Sage, the username should following this format:

```
# User Full Name <email@somewhere.com>
```
You can set a proper username in the file `~/.hgrc` with something like

```
[ui]
username = Full Name <email@somewhere.com>
```
I say "should", not "must". If you don't want to, then at least fill in the "Author(s):" field with your full name. That way, it makes it easy to credit you.

Hi,

I get 8 rejects when trying to apply the first patch to a 100% clean build of sage-4.1:

The new patches are against r12658. The old ones were as well, but I don't know what happened to them.

I've fixed them up with `hg histedit`. I don't see any repeated changes in the patches anymore. Please tell me if there are anymore problems.\n\nBreaking them up seems like a good idea. There are quite a lot of functions though, so there'll be a lot of patches. It may be inconvenient to try them all. Anyways, I'll work on them asap.",

@qed777

Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, that's a typo. Thanks for catching it.

It seems that the patches are messed up. I've fixed them up with `hg histedit`. I don't see any repeated changes in the patches anymore. Please tell me if there are anymore problems.

Breaking them up seems like a good idea. There are quite a lot of functions though, so there'll be a lot of patches. It may be inconvenient to try them all. Anyways, I'll work on them asap.

From some testing in Firefox 3.5 on Linux, with both new patches applied:
* Live doc worksheets do not load their stylesheets.
* Published worksheets are now [partially] editable.
* The "re-publish" and "stop publishing" buttons do not work, apparently.
* The print representation of a worksheet is missing cell boundaries.

Also, a number of doctests in `notebook.py` and `worksheet.py` failed with `sage -t -long -option -verbose -randorder`.  For `worksheet.py`, there are mostly just small changes in expected HTML output.  I think some of the randomized failures are pre-existing:

* I think clicking "No" in reply to "Do you want to publish this worksheet" unpublishes the worksheet, but it does not return the sheet to interactive mode.

  * jsMath is not included in printed worksheets.  The page itself is missing the title.

  * How does the `morecss` block work?  Can we now avoid `twist.py`'s "hack" altogether?

  * Should, e.g., `server/notebook/templates/doc.html` still be there?

If you're not already using the [Mercurial Queues extension](http://wiki.sagemath.org/MercurialQueues), it may be worth trying. `hg qrefresh` can be very helpful.

I've added Jason Grout to the CC: list, since my checks may not cover the range of notebook usage patterns.  Perhaps we can get other volunteers?

**Attachment:** [trac_6568-jinja_migration_v2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6568/trac_6568-jinja_migration_v2.patch.gz)

Version 2 (of the uber-patch) should fix introspection.  It also
* Simplifies `Notebook.plain_text_worksheet_html()`.
* Indents `Notebook.html_debug_window()`'s docstring.

There's still some HTML generation in
* `Notebook.object_list_html()`, `Notebook.list_window_javascript()`, `Notebook.html_settings()`.
* `Worksheet.html_ratings_into()`
but these methods are unused or minor.  Of course, there's markup in `interact.py`, etc.

Should we make a separate ticket for moving `css.py`'s stylesheets to `templates/`?  Rebasing other tickets against this one may be easier than the opposite.

My review is positive, though someone else should check the most recent changes.  It would be useful to get feedback from other testers.

REFEREE REPORT:

The Sphinx docstrings that you added, which are very good, have a formatting problem, namely below there needs to be a newline before each - (i.e., lots of whitespace):

```
 	1315	        INPUT: 
 	1316	        - ``username`` - a string 
 	1317	        - ``worksheet`` - an instance of Worksheet 
 	1318	 
 	1319	        OUTPUT: 
 	1320	        - a string containing the HTML 
```
See this screenshot: http://wstein.org/home/wstein/tmp/jinja1.png which illustrates how the ReST is messed up.  This isn't a big deal, since I don't think this code is even in the reference manual yet...  But it would be good to go through and fix. 

All doctests pass, and *using* the notebook after applying the patches seems to work fine -- I can't find any visible difference. 

I give this a positive review.  Proper Sphinxing of docs can go in a future patch, and be done throughout the notebook server code.

```
When I ran the test suite with the patch, I received a timed out error:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/ecm.py
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
	 [1800.1 s]
```
This error has nothing to do with the patch. It might be due to sage.math being too busy or its system resources (probably RAM) nearing capacity. Merged `trac_6568-jinja_migration_v2.patch`.

I think #6840 will take care of these.

**Attachment:** [trac_6568-manifest.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6568/trac_6568-manifest.patch.gz)

The patch `trac_6568-manifest.patch` prevents repository corruption. A repository corruption can happen because `trac_6568-jinja_migration_v2.patch` adds two new directories:

1. `sage/server/notebook/templates/notebook/`
2. `sage/server/notebook/templates/worksheet/`

If the file `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/MANIFEST.in` is not patched to handle files under these new directories, those files won't be picked up when making a source release with `sage -sdist`.
