Building the documentation currently raises something like 50 errors because of incorrect ReST formatting in docstrings (mostly "unexpected indent" or similar). We should probably have a policy of not merging patches that cause documentation building errors, just as we don't merge patches that cause doctest failures.

I have found and fixed most of the errors in 4.0.rc1 (some with great difficulty, because the ReST parser is very unreliable at telling you where the error is arising in a given file).

I know this is a bit last-minute, but the patch below doesn't actually change any code at all, so it might not be too late to include it in the final 4.0 release.

With the above patch applied, the documentation should build fine.

John: I've cced you here, since you say you have suffered from this too :-) Any chance you could review this one quickly, since it would be good to get it into 4.0?
