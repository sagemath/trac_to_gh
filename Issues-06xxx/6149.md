Building the documentation currently raises something like 50 errors because of incorrect ReST formatting in docstrings (mostly "unexpected indent" or similar). We should probably have a policy of not merging patches that cause documentation building errors, just as we don't merge patches that cause doctest failures.

I have found and fixed most of the errors in 4.0.rc1 (some with great difficulty, because the ReST parser is very unreliable at telling you where the error is arising in a given file).

I know this is a bit last-minute, but the patch below doesn't actually change any code at all, so it might not be too late to include it in the final 4.0 release.
