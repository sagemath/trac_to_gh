Upgrading from alpha0 on Fedora 10 failed somehow. I had to remove constants.so
by hand.

$ rm devel/sage/build/sage/symbolic/constants.so

Now testing.

On Fedora 9 I'll do a fresh install.

```

I (=william) did remove enough constants.* files, which resulted in the above.  I will attach a patch to fix this.
