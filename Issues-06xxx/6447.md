```
This feature would add another backend to 3D plotting, in addition to Jmol and Tachyon, that would render the plot using the new HTML5 <canvas> element, which supports drawing arbitrary shapes to a section of a web page.

The idea was initially suggested in [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9e0ca32eb97d5757/d47d88b28d292512) on sage-devel.

Although JavaScript is significantly slower than Java, a canvas backend is feasible and might provide a nice, compatible, alternative.

<a id='comment:1'></a>The attached patch implements the feature as described, although it currently only renders in wireframe.

Try it out for yourself:

```
x, y = var('x y')
plot3d(sin(pi*(x^2+y^2))/2,(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1), viewer='canvas3d', plot_points=(20, 20))
```

A couple of issues need to be addressed:

* Doctests. As well as documentation to make this feature visible to an end-user.
* Solid polygons. Here we run into problems like depth-testing and shading. I'm sure there are JavaScript libraries available for 3D rendering using canvas. Could we plug one of these in?

(1) I don't think you should worry too much about wireframe versus solid polygons yet.   This is javascript/canvas, after all.  I think it would be much better to focus on rendering a wider range of objects, e.g., make it so 

```
icosahedron(color='red', viewer='canvas3d') + sphere(viewer='canvas3d')
```
works. 

(2) I notice that you're "I'm sure there are JavaScript? libraries available for 3D rendering using canvas. Could we plug one of these in?"  I tried googling for some of those words, and the first thing that pops up is:
   http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas3dtexture_0.2/
If you turn off the texture in that link and render some of the models (select from the list on the right), you'll see that indeed you are right, there are now 3d canvas javascript libraries.

That's a good idea. I found a tuple called "orientation" in Graphics3d.export_jmol, so I think I can copy the values from that.

>  * Is it possible to enable axes?


Axes are not currently implemented, although they can be. I think all that's necessary is to add support for arrow3d.
