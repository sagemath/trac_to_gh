    Hi David,

    This is inconsistent:


    sage: e =EtaProduct(3, {3:12, 1:-12})
    sage: e.qexp(10)  # but no q_expansion function

    Everywhere else in Sage we write "q_expansion" and have qexp as an alias. It thus took me a while to find e.qexp, since I expected e.q_expansion. What do you think?


Agreed. I wrote most of that class during a lunch break at a conference last summer, and at the time I didn't have much of a clue about Sage conventions (as is probably clear to anyone reading the code). Please feel free to change it!
