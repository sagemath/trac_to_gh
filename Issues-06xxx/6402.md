Looks good, and the added documentation is really great.

I'm attaching a tiny referee patch fixing a few typos, and if you are ok with it we can give this a positive review.

There is one small issue, which I leave up to you whether you want to fix it or not: in the method `valuation_plot`, you added an optional argument `rmax`, but the docstring says nothing about its role.
