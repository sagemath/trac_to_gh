The code for both v*M and M*v has the result of type:

        s = v.parent()(0) 

However, the dimension here is clearly wrong---we don't get a result the size of the vector, but the number of rows of M if computing M*v, and the number of columns of M if computing v*M.

I still think there is a problem.  For dense things, v*M gets its base ring from M, not v.  However, the above patch gets the base ring from v.  That's what my doctest patch tests.

<a id='comment:10'>**Comment 10:**</a>
The doctest

```
sage:  (m*v).parent() is m.row(0).parent()
```

looks backwards to me (columns <-> rows).  A matrix-vector product should be a linear combination of the columns of the matrix, no?  I think the only reason it passes is that the matrix employed is square.  If I make the matrix rectangular, it fails.  If correct, the companion in the other method also needs fixing.

The original doctest patch has contributions to to `sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx` and `sage/matrix/matrix_sparse.pyx`, but the sparse tests are in the latest patch, but the "0" tests are not.

With some guidance, I'd look at this again for a review.
