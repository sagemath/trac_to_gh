If I delete a data file using the notebook (Data... pop up menu -> file name -> delete file name link), the file is deleted, but the browser then goes to a blank page titled "Error | Sage Notebook". The browser is Safari 4 on OS X 10.5, in case that makes a difference.

William Stein reported on Sage-Support:

I've seen this.  This definitely didn't used to happen.  Somebody introduced this bug a few months ago.  Please report it to trac.  I'll fix it in September/October when I work on the notebook, if nobody beats me to it.
