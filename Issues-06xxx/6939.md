Currently, a scrollbar appears down at the bottom of the entire worksheet, which is only minimally helpful, since you then need to go to the bottom and scroll everything over.

This patch makes scrollbars appear on output that is too wide, but just on that output.

To test, do something like:

```
f=cos(x)-x
show(f.taylor(x,0,50))
```

in the notebook

Sweet.  I love CSS.  Tested successfully on Safari 4 and Firefox 3.5.  Wish I had access to IE or Linux versions, but this should be okay.

Check out also:

```
show(plot(sin(x),-10,10),figsize=[20,20])
```
So you can now generate big pictures in the notebook if you have a reason to do so.  

But question: why not just overflow, not overflow-x, or also overflow-y?  Those eternally long outputs can be a real pain at times.  Try factorial(10000). Also, how many browsers support CSS3 and not just CSS2?  I can imagine a lot of people on XP having problems with some old version of IE.

Not overflow-y because Sage already handles long vertical outputs by shunting to a file and suppressing text, and besides, who's to say how tall is too tall?  Vertically, we just go by the browser width.  It's a lot harder to guess the magical height that is just right.

If you think this is good, then you can put a positive review and we can discuss the overflow-y and see if it is needed.

No problem with the vertical, though personally I would prefer a little shorter output, as the screen sometimes jumps rather dramatically and it's hard to scroll back and forth...

What about the CSS3 versus CSS2 issue?  On the one hand, I found a quote on css3.info that "Support for these properties is strong as they were first defined by IE6." but on the other hand wikipedia implies that support for this first came in Trident engine 7, which may or may not correspond to IE7...  Maybe the best solution is this one: "Try specifying the CSS2 overflow property first ... then specify the CSS3 overflow-x/y properties to override it on browsers that can."  Of course, that comment was from 2007.

Anyway, as long as it doesn't cause the page to not render at all, I guess this is okay.  If you have time to put in an overflow check first, that would be great.

I don't see anything wrong, as long as you don't review your own changes and make it positive review. In this case, I see that you reviewed someone else's (mpatel) changes which in this case is a rebase. You never know; rebasing a patch can actually cause unexpected problems. Thank you for your work!
