This module provides a class to study properties such as nonlinearity, resiliency, correlation immunity, algebraic immunity and other cryptographic properties of Boolean functions.

Some of these are still missing, but I think it is a good start.

**Review**

* typo: "This module allow" -> allows
* it would be nice to have docs for `walsh`, `yellow_code`, `reed_muller`
* maybe replace "BooleanPolynomial" with ":class:`sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanPolynomial`" which adds a link in the reference manual
* `if isinstance(x, list)` could be changed to `if isinstance(x, (list,tuple,GeneratorType)` to be less dependent on the type, you'll need to `from types import GeneratorType`
* is it wanted that these don't have a type? `cdef _walsh_transform, _nvariables, _big_endian, _nonlinearity`
* typo: "table truth" -> "truth table"
* cmp doesn't have a proper doctest
* Maybe put the world "True" in  "``True``" ?
* Should() popcount() really return a Python int instead of a Sage integer?

* Patch applies without error but with some fuzz against 4.1 (this isn't an issue)
* Doctests pass.
* Reference manual builds without warning.
* Reference manual looks good.

Hi,
here is an updated patch. I addressed most of Martin's remarks.
popcount now returns an int, because it's what nbits does.

If someone wants to try some Boolean functions, he can have a look at http://www.ii.uib.no/~mohamedaa/odbf/search.html and compare the results.

Merged patches in this order:

1. `trac_6514_BooleanFunction.patch`
2. `trac_6514_review.patch`
 
Running the test suite gave me some doctest failures:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/server/simple/twist.py # 3 doctests failed
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/server/notebook/notebook.py # 1 doctests failed
```
A full log is attached. These doctest failures have nothing to do with the above patches; they have been reported before in Sage 4.1.1.
