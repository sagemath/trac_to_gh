The full Stein-Watkins package fails to install cleanly on x86_64-
redhat-linux

http://modular.math.washington.edu/Tables/ecdb/stein-watkins-ecdb.spkg

The relevant lines from install-log seem to be:

mv: invalid option -- r
Try `mv --help' for more information.

Since the install script only moves some .bz2 files into the data
directory, it's easy to figure out how to do this by hand and after a
2.7Gb download, one is remarkably motivated to do so. So I'm a very
happy user of the database now. But William might want to fix the
install script ...

Cheers,

Nils
