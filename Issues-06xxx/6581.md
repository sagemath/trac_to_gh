I'm not sure if this is a problem in the multivariate polynomials (which seem to raise the actual error) or somewhere in the symbolics.

The failure is because the polynomials' parent is of type `MPolynomialRing_polydict`, but `MPolynomialRing_polydict_domain` is the type with the necessary methods `monomial_divides`, `monomial_pairwise_prime`, etc.

* Should a polynomial ring in this case always initialize as `..._domain`?
* If not, is there an easy option to create the ideal of such a ring? (in this case, at most a documentation change is necessary)
* If no such method currently exists, what would be the best way to let the user do this?

If you only want symbolic variables, wouldn't this work:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c> = QQ[]
sage: K = Frac(P)
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in a, b, c over Rational Field
```

This gets mapped to a Singular ring with parameters, i.e., to this one:

```
> ring r = (0,a,b,c),(x,y,z),dp;
> r;
//   characteristic : 0
//   3 parameter    : a b c 
//   minpoly        : 0
//   number of vars : 3
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

So, this works:

```
sage: singular(P)
//   characteristic : 0
//   3 parameter    : a b c 
//   minpoly        : 0
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y
//        block   2 : ordering C
sage: I = Ideal([P.random_element(), P.random_element()])
sage: %time gb = I.groebner_basis()
```

but it's slow.

Would this work when we place some assumptions on the variables; e.g., `a<sup>2+b</sup>2==1`? That was my particular situations, and I was under the impression that doing it in the way you suggest won't work for that.
