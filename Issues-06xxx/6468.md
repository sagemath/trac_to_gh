The `__call__` method of `FiniteField_prime_modn` reads like this:

```
    def __call__(self, x):
        try:
            return integer_mod.IntegerMod(self, x)
        except (NotImplementedError, PariError):
            return TypeError, "error coercing to finite field"
        except TypeError:
            if sage.interfaces.all.is_GapElement(x):
                from sage.interfaces.gap import gfq_gap_to_sage
                try:
                    return gfq_gap_to_sage(x, self)
                except (ValueError, IndexError, TypeError), msg:
                    raise TypeError, "%s\nerror coercing to finite field"%msg
            else:
                raise
```

So, in the fourth line of the function body, an error is not raised but returned.

Actually I met this when calling `GF(2)` with one of my extension types. Unfortunately I did not find anything in Sage that would trigger it as well.

Anyway, I think it should be obvious that 

```
            return TypeError, "error coercing to finite field"
```
should be changed into

```
            raise TypeError, "error coercing to finite field"
```

This is what my patch does.

I'd be happy to do so. But it turns out that it is not easy to make `integer_mod.IntegerMod(self, x)` raising a `NotImplementedError` or a `PariError`. By accident, I found that this is the case when using my extension class for describing elements of modular polynomial rings of finite p-groups. But certainly items from a to-be-created-and-at-most-optional package can't be part of a doc test...

I try to cook something else up that triggers the error. But perhaps you now better how to produce a PariError?

Anyway, since currently the call method has no doc test at all, it is certainly wise to create one.

Best regards

Gotcha!

The following nasty example triggers the error:

```
sage: class foo_parent(Parent):
....:     pass
....:
sage: class foo(RingElement):
....:     def lift(self):
....:         raise PariError
....:
sage: P = foo_parent()
sage: F = foo(P)
sage: GF(2)(F)
(<type 'exceptions.TypeError'>, 'error coercing to finite field')
```

I will produce a patch, adding doc tests to the call method (it is currently lacking any doc tests!), and also adding the nasty example with reference to this ticket.

PS: I did the doc tests for the patched version of sage/rings/integer_mod_ring.py, and they passed. However, as I have only sage-4.0.2, it'd be better if someone else runs the tests as well.
