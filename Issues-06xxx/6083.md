It turns out the segfault was coming from an infinite loop in Cython. The issue was that after the first patch above, doing `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` would call into the `__mod__` on `IntegerMod_gmp`, which tried to check if something was zero by doing something of the form `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` ... and repeat ad infinitum. 

So the new patch adds a small snippet to fix this, and a doctest.
