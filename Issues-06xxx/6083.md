I now get one trivial test failure (changed exception message):

```
File "/home/fredrik/sage-4.0/devel/sage-mpmath/sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 2163:

Otherwise, this patch has my approval.

Unfortunately, this causes a segfault with the 4.0.2.alpha0 singular:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py # Segfault
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 524.4 seconds
Tests failed!

Attachment [trac-6083-referee.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6083/trac-6083-referee.patch) by @craigcitro created at 2009-06-22 07:45:17

It turns out the segfault was coming from an infinite loop in Cython. The issue was that after the first patch above, doing `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` would call into the `__mod__` on `IntegerMod_gmp`, which tried to check if something was zero by doing something of the form `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` ... and repeat ad infinitum. 

So the new patch adds a small snippet to fix this, and a doctest.
