This patch looks good. I've added a referee patch that makes a few really minor changes:

* removes the unused `_floordiv` function
* changes the error messages: they all now say either "Integer division by zero" or "Integer modulo by zero." I think these are more informative, and they also now mirror the Python ones (which all say "integer division or modulus by zero"). The old ones were of the form `"other (=%s) must be nonzero"%other`, and by definition **always** had other equal to 0, so that just seemed silly.

It turns out the segfault was coming from an infinite loop in Cython.
