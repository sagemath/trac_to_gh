This patch looks good. I've added a referee patch that makes a few really minor changes:

* removes the unused `_floordiv` function
* changes the error messages: they all now say either "Integer division by zero" or "Integer modulo by zero." I think these are more informative, and they also now mirror the Python ones (which all say "integer division or modulus by zero"). The old ones were of the form `"other (=%s) must be nonzero"%other`, and by definition **always** had other equal to 0, so that just seemed silly. 

Unless Robert or Fredrik has any objections to the second patch, I'd say this is good to go.

It turns out the segfault was coming from an infinite loop in Cython. The issue was that after the first patch above, doing `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` would call into the `__mod__` on `IntegerMod_gmp`, which tried to check if something was zero by doing something of the form `Integer % IntegerMod_gmp` ... and repeat ad infinitum. 

So the new patch adds a small snippet to fix this, and a doctest.
