```
eval_modular_form(points, prec) 
Evaluate the L-series of this elliptic curve at points in CC 
INPUT: 
•points - a list of points in the half-plane of convergence 
•prec - precision 
OUTPUT: A list of values L(E,s) for s in points 
Note: Better examples are welcome. 
EXAMPLES: 
sage: E=EllipticCurve(’37a1’) 
sage: E.eval_modular_form([1.5+I,2.0+I,2.5+I],0.000001) 
[0, 0, 0] 
```

It should *NOT* say L-series above.  It should say modular form.
