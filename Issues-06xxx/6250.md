As far as I remember, what was discussed on the list was about the order of an *element* of a field/group/...

Here this is about the order of the group itself, which is its cardinality.

I don't agree with the suggestion in one of the docstrings that order might be deprecated. But that is just my (American) opinion, which might not be shared by the rest of the world:-) In any case, the patches do not apply cleanly to 4.0.rc0.

I am fine with both options. From discussions on sage-devel, it seems that in general aliases are somewhat frowned upon.
We definitely want .cardinality(). But yes, even in Europe, some users would certainly be trying G.order() to get the size
of the group. That's why I raised the issue.

I am happy to remove the comment if you think its better.

? I just retried, and it applies smoothly on sage 4.0.1. Did you only apply the second patch? (the first one should be deleted)

The second patch applied cleanly to 4.0.rc0 but failed sage -testall. I think it was unrelated but I'll retry on another version of Sage.
