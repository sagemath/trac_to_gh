Help for is_SymbolicVariable and is_SymbolicExpressionRing is nonexistent, for Python reasons, apparently:

```
sage: is_SymbolicExpressionRing??
Error getting source: could not find class definition
Type: partial
...
partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application of the given arguments and keywords.
```
Notice that these functions do have useful docstrings, they just aren't showing up.  This was originally reported in #2562.

Keywords: **partial, help, doc**

    Returns True if *R* is the symbolic expression ring.
