This should work:

```
sage: S = mq.SBox(3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2)
sage: S(0)
3
sage: S([0,0,0])
[1, 1]
```

REFEREE REPORT



Patch applies OK against sage-4.0.1.alpha0, all tests pass even with `-long` option. Most of the patch deals with Sphinxifying the module `sage/crypto/mq/sbox.py`. But the main issue is to fix the bug reported at this [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/91ec1975d7bfc565/d6113194a8a6cc3f) thread. And the patch does exactly as claimed. Positive review. I've attached a reviewer patch that fixes some trivial formatting typos.
