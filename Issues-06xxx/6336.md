Here's a patch.  This seems to fix this bug, but exposes another optional doctest failure (related to octave, I think): on sage.math, before the patch, I see the error message printed above.  After the patch, I don't, although I see this:

```
sage -t -optional "devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst"
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! PROCESS KILLED! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
*** *** Error: TIMED OUT! *** ***
	 [360.1 s]
```
So this patch is a partial fix.  Any takers for the octave timeout?

Patch applies fine to 4.0.2.rc1 and passes sage -tp 1 SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/. Also the builds sage -docbuild constructions html (resp., pdf) went fine.
