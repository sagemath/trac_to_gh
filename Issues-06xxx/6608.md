If you type (at the command line)

```
latex.blackboard_bold?
```
you get the docstring for this, but it is missing all of the backslashes.  This is because the docstring is being processed by the `detex` function, but it's not supposed to be: the docstring contains a "nodetex" directive.  (You can see the backslashes and the "nodetex" directive if you type `latex.blackboard_bold??`.)

The attached patch makes this work again.  Test with the above, or with `view?` or with `sage.misc.sagedoc.detex?`, for instance.

Looks good to me. I tried to create a new doctest for this but it was a) too big and ugly and/or b) too fragile to be useful. Adam
