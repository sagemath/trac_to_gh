I'm not sure what needs to be checked here. It installs fine on an amd64 ubuntu 9.04 machine and passes sage -testall.

Are there any tests I should run? I saw nothing on the url given in the ticket but I am not an OR person.

Positive review from me as far as I can tell, as an optional package.

I forgot all about the voting process I immediately send a message on Sage-devel about it.

This package has to be included in the --standard-- package repository if we want Sage to have any native LP feature ( see #6502 ). Coin-or and Cplex are both GPL-uncompatible ;-)

I did not know that !!!

I'm pretty new aboard, and the only thing I wrote for Sage was an interface for Cliquer, which has seemingly found a shortcut through all these steps ;-)

I may be in a hurry, but it is just because :
* I am impatient to see this patch accepted 
* I have already written several graph functions waiting to be included in the Graph class that I will not post until MIP is included into Sage 

Sorry again ! I'll try to be a bit more patient ;-)
