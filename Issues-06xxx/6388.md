```
Although log(x) function in new symbolics is appeared to be defined for entire complex plane, it throws out error sometime 

(1) Negative argument

```
sage: log(-1 + 0*I)
I*pi
sage: log(-1)
...
ValueError: self must be positive
```
It behaves differently for mathematically equivalent arguments.


(2) Value of log(x) at x=0

```
sage: log(0)
...
ValueError: self must be positive
```

log(0) should throw out an unevaluated symbolic expression "log(0)" instead of raising error. Depending on the way it appears in an expression, one could use it for simplifications.

Hi,

Thanks, you have added more features than I had wanted. Here are my last comments before
I give positive review:

```
sage: log(SR(-1), e)
I*pi
sage: log(CDF(-1), e)
3.14159265359*I
```

works but it doesn't work or CC, RR, CIF...

I think, it would be better if you could change this two lines in log() 

```
except AttributeError:
    return ln(x) / ln(base)
```

to

```
except (AttributeError, TypeError):
    return log(x) / log(base)
```

We should call log() recursively so that it can take advantage of
the features that you have added. Another supplementary patch should be fine too.
