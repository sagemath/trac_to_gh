```
Although log(x) function in new symbolics is appeared to be defined for entire complex plane, it throws out error sometime 

(1) Negative argument

```
sage: log(-1 + 0*I)
I*pi
sage: log(-1)
...
ValueError: self must be positive
```
It behaves differently for mathematically equivalent arguments.


(2) Value of log(x) at x=0

```
sage: log(0)
...
ValueError: self must be positive
```

log(0) should throw out an unevaluated symbolic expression "log(0)" instead of raising error. Depending on the way it appears in an expression, one could use it for simplifications.

I am going through this patch. It applied cleanly and also passed some of the doctests that
I tried. Few initial comments:

While log(SR(0)) typesets nicely but log(CC(0)) or log(RDF(0)) doesn't. Although, I don't think
that this patch should fix these typesetting issue but in case there is an one-liner fix.

Hi,

Thanks, you have added more features than I had wanted. Here are my last comments before
I give positive review:

```
sage: log(SR(-1), e)
I*pi
sage: log(CDF(-1), e)
3.14159265359*I
```

works but it doesn't work or CC, RR, CIF...

I think, it would be better if you could change this two lines in log() 

```
except AttributeError:
    return ln(x) / ln(base)
```

to

```
except (AttributeError, TypeError):
    return log(x) / log(base)
```

We should call log() recursively so that it can take advantage of
the features that you have added. Another supplementary patch should be fine too.
