For example, there seems to be a simple knapsack problems solved here: http://sites.google.com/site/mikescoderama/Home/0-1-knapsack-problem-in-p
There is a more complicated one here: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Knapsack_Problem#Simple_Solution

I just added documentation and the example you required. I guess the docstrings took me 10 times what the function requires, but I learned a lot about sage's documentation, the Reference manual, Sphinx, and the fact that you should NEVER, for ANY REASON, delete a branch of Sage.

It gets angry if you do.

And I uploaded a new knapsack.patch replacing the old one ;-)

This patch (after the dependencies are applied) applies fine to 4.1.1.rc2 on an intel macbook running 10.4.11. It passes sage -testall except for (apparently unrelated) errors with 

```
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
```
However, I will ask someone at work (an expert in OR) to check the code before posting a positive review.

Excellent suggestion ! So :
* I fixed the grammar error ( sorry, I'm still learning english every day ;-) )
* I Included the objective value in the output

But :
Actually, this objective value requires no computation at all as it is automatically computed by the LP solver.. So as it can be useful anyway, the function now returns a pair [value, list] ( where list is the value the function returned previously ), and value=maximum useful value.
Besides, I added the flag value_only in case the use only needs the optimal value and does not care about the assignment. This, because the LP solvers can be forced not to return the assignment of the variables and only the objective value, avoiding this way some computations.

Besides, this syntax makes knapsack consistant with the other optimization functions I wrote for graphs, and I hope will all the LP functions we will write in the future ;-)

To avoid mistakes, I updated both patches ( they were identical ), and the new version obviously contains the old one, plus the update I just wrote ! 

Thank you for your review !

Nathann

I always forget the LP solvers are non-deterministic algorithms, and because of this the values they return sometimes change, which causes trouble with docstrings ;-)

Sorry !

This last patch (and its dependency) installed fine as before (same system, and version) with the following failures:

```
The following tests failed:

I think these are unrelated, so this gets a positive review from me. Thanks for implementing it!

With `knapsack-symbolics.patch`, I got a warning when building the reference manual:

```
