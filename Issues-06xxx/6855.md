<div id="comment:0"></div>

A Sage Embed API, for loading cells or worksheets easily in external web pages, could be useful.  For example,

```text
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
    <title>Sage Embed API demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sage_embed.css" />
    <script src="sage_embed.js"></script>
    <script>
```

```js
      var initialize = function () {
          var cell = new SageCell(); // empty by default
          cell.init(document.getElementById('cell1'));

          var ws = new SageWorksheet();
          ws.load('http://sagenb.org/url/to/worksheet/');
          ws.init(document.getElementById('worksheet1'));
      };
```

```text
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="initialize();">
    <div id="cell1" style="height: 10.0em; width: 20.0em;"></div>
    Blah, blah, blah.
    <div id="worksheet1" style="height: 600px; width: 100%;"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

There's still plenty to do, but I'm making progress.  Version 10:

They should have wider applicability than published and remote embedded interacts.  For example, we could use "g" cells to communicate graph data bidirectionally (cf. #1321), "p" cells for plots, "i" cells for introspection, and so on.

* Should contain **far less** [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/).  This was painful, but it was very useful --- it revealed subtle (to me, at least) problems, potential and actual.

* Subsumes #5644.  This required rewriting most of the introspection functions.  Now each cell has it's own set of introspection variables, but they're all stored in just one global dictionary `introspect`.  Reducing our global footprint (and the probability of library conflicts) is important for embedding worksheets, but I don't plan to take this further just now.

V14 gets (all but one of the) [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) ([Grid](http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/)) test to pass in

* Linux: FF3.5.
* Windows XP: FF3.5, IE8, O10.

Several tests fail in Chrome on XP --- `self.logout()` raises the complaint, ["This webpage has a redirect loop."](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22This%20webpage%20has%20a%20redirect%20loop.%22)  I think this is a Chrome bug.

Safari on XP interprets, e.g., `/home/mike/0/` as the local resource `file:///home/mike/0/`, which it refuses to load.  I think this is a Selenium bug.

But both Chrome and Safari sometimes display `Please enable cookies or delete all Sage cookies and localhost cookies in your browser and try again.`  Could this be a SageNB bug?

Selenium is far from consistent in its ability to fire "special" keyboard events (e.g., `tab`, `shift-enter`), so I've substituted notebook JS functions, for now.

"I love it when a plan comes together." - [Hannibal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_%22Hannibal%22_Smith)

Not quite, perhaps, but we're getting close.  The new published interacts patch sequence (`trac_6855-published_interacts_B*.patch`), based on #7666, is at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/6855/

Still to do:

* Give proxy cells an expiration date.

* Some of the "TODO" items in `twist.py`.

I'm a bit behind schedule --- I think I underestimated the extent of the changes needed.  But I think it was very important, if not necessary, for me to understand more deeply how the many parts of the Sage Notebook *interact*.  We'll get there soon!

Other changes of interest:

* Data sent from server to client is [JSON](http://www.json.org/js.html)-encoded.
* `active_cell_list` is `console.log`ged (or displayed in a floating dialog) *when* it changes.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

B15 enables cell expiration ("garbage collection") for the proxy worksheet process, which can handle multiple concurrent viewers.  Still to do:

* Security: Make recomputing / updating `interact`s send only *data* (e.g., arguments), not call the library functions `_interact_.update` and `_interact_.recompute` directly.  Otherwise, a user can execute arbitrary code (on a private server with working published interacts) by prefixing it with `'%__sage_interact__'`.  This should be straightforward to implement, although I'm not sure about replacing the `sage_eval`s in `interact.py`.  Perhaps we can suppress them in "public mode"?

* Allow a worksheet to use a *pool* of `sage` processes to evaluate queued cells [1].  Since we `reset()` after each `interact` update, the main difficulty here is passing a cell's global `_interact_.state` to the process assigned to evaluate the cell.  Can we simplify and store this state in a cell attribute?

[1] Related: Share one compute process among multiple worksheets (cf. #7655).

Anyway, with or without these changes, the logical next step is allocate a `W_remote_proxy` worksheet for *remote* `interact`s analogous to the published `interact`s' `W_pub_proxy`.

Published interacts apparently are there (but highly recommended not to be used), while the [Sage cell server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/) very admirably enables embedding - probably using a lot of the same ideas here, in principle.  There is so much awesome work here, but I just feel like it has gone nowhere in many years so it is probably better to close it, since the main goal is indeed available.
