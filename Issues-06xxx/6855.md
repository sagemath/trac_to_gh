A Sage Embed API, for loading cells or worksheets easily in external web pages, could be useful.  For example,

```text/html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
    <title>Sage Embed API demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sage_embed.css" />
    <script src="sage_embed.js"></script>
    <script>
```

```js
      var initialize = function () {
          var cell = new SageCell(); // empty by default
          cell.init(document.getElementById('cell1'));

          var ws = new SageWorksheet();
          ws.load('http://sagenb.org/url/to/worksheet/');
          ws.init(document.getElementById('worksheet1'));
      };
```

```text/html
    </script>
  </head>
  <body onload="initialize();">
    <div id="cell1" style="height: 10.0em; width: 20.0em;"></div>
    Blah, blah, blah.
    <div id="worksheet1" style="height: 600px; width: 100%;"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Version 10:\n\n* Should allow alphanumeric cell ids.  \"Integers\" project to integers (e.g., `'0'` is `0`, `\"19\"` is `19`, etc.).  In particular, we can continue to use non-negative integers for ordinary compute/text cells.  But cells whose ids begin with a non-integer character are [optionally] \"special\" (e.g., `'tmp123'` is `'tmp123'`).  They should have wider applicability than published and remote embedded interacts.  For example, we could use \"g\" cells to communicate graph data bidirectionally (cf. #1321), \"p\" cells for plots, \"i\" cells for introspection, and so on.\n\n* Should contain **far less** [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/).  This was painful, but it was very useful --- it revealed subtle (to me, at least) problems, potential and actual.\n\n* Subsumes #5644.  This required rewriting most of the introspection functions.  Now each cell has it's own set of introspection variables, but they're all stored in just one global dictionary `introspect`.  Reducing our global footprint (and the probability of library conflicts) is important for embedding worksheets, but I don't plan to take this further just now.\n\nNote: I still need to test browsers other than FF 3.5.5 on Linux.",

<a id='comment:11'></a>Updated patches are available here:

* [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/6855/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/6855/)

There's still plenty to do, but I'm making progress.  Version 10:

* Should allow alphanumeric cell ids.  "Integers" project to integers (e.g., `'0'` is `0`, `"19"` is `19`, etc.).  In particular, we can continue to use non-negative integers for ordinary compute/text cells.  But cells whose ids begin with a non-integer character are [optionally] "special" (e.g., `'tmp123'` is `'tmp123'`).  They should have wider applicability than published and remote embedded interacts.  For example, we could use "g" cells to communicate graph data bidirectionally (cf. #1321), "p" cells for plots, "i" cells for introspection, and so on.

* Should contain **far less** [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/).  This was painful, but it was very useful --- it revealed subtle (to me, at least) problems, potential and actual.

* Subsumes #5644.  This required rewriting most of the introspection functions.  Now each cell has it's own set of introspection variables, but they're all stored in just one global dictionary `introspect`.  Reducing our global footprint (and the probability of library conflicts) is important for embedding worksheets, but I don't plan to take this further just now.

Note: I still need to test browsers other than FF 3.5.5 on Linux.

<a id='comment:12'></a>V14 gets (all but one of the) [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) ([Grid](http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/)) test to pass in

* Linux: FF3.5.
* Windows XP: FF3.5, IE8, O10.

Several tests fail in Chrome on XP --- `self.logout()` raises the complaint, ["This webpage has a redirect loop."](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22This%20webpage%20has%20a%20redirect%20loop.%22)  I think this is a Chrome bug.

Safari on XP interprets, e.g., `/home/mike/0/` as the local resource `file:///home/mike/0/`, which it refuses to load.  I think this is a Selenium bug.

But both Chrome and Safari sometimes display `Please enable cookies or delete all Sage cookies and localhost cookies in your browser and try again.`  Could this be a SageNB bug?

Selenium is far from consistent in its ability to fire "special" keyboard events (e.g., `tab`, `shift-enter`), so I've substituted notebook JS functions, for now.

<a id='comment:13'></a>"I love it when a plan comes together." - [Hannibal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_%22Hannibal%22_Smith)

Not quite, perhaps, but we're getting close.  The new published interacts patch sequence (`trac_6855-published_interacts_B*.patch`), based on #7666, is at

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/6855/

Still to do:

* Give proxy cells an expiration date.
* Proxy worksheet process pool.
* `server_conf` setting.
* Some of the "TODO" items in `twist.py`.

I'm a bit behind schedule --- I think I underestimated the extent of the changes needed.  But I think it was very important, if not necessary, for me to understand more deeply how the many parts of the Sage Notebook *interact*.  We'll get there soon!

Other changes of interest:

* Data sent from server to client is [JSON](http://www.json.org/js.html)-encoded.
* `active_cell_list` is `console.log`ged (or displayed in a floating dialog) *when* it changes.
