I did a search, on www.sagemath.org, for "gram schmidt".  In the Documentation section, there was no link returned for the documentation of the method "gram_schmidt", although this was exactly what I was looking for:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/matrix/matrix2.html#sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix.gram_schmidt

Perhaps our custom Google search can be tweaked?

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

technically, it is all set so that it should work. I've added some redundant sites:

```
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage    doc 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/a_tour_of_sage/    doc 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/    doc 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/    doc 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/    developer 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/constructions    doc 
	http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/    doc 
```
(label "doc" is for used for documentation)

and a master page for the reference to point to all pages

```
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/genindex-all.html [extract linked partial sites]   doc   
```

maybe it works now better, but i'm not sure.

tested again, it finds "gram_schmidt" now. only "gram schmidt" seems to be too vague. ticket can be closed.
