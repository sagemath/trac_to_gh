This looks good, with the same caveat that we need to remember to remove the `spkg-check` before we release. (Is there an obvious reason there isn't just a flag for these we set somewhere in the sage build process?)

There is such a flag.  It's SAGE_CHECK.  See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6282.  It's just not documented, so nobody seems to know about it.
