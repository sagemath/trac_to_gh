New version of package GLPK for Sage. There is nothing new except that this spkg now embeds the function solveGLPK which was previously included directly into Sage ( stupid, as this is to be an optional package ).
Hence, this code has already been positively reviewed in #6502

As with package COIN-OR/CBC, the function is now compiled when the package is installed, then loaded by sage.numerical.mip when solve() is called.

The package can be installed this way

I tested this as before (with #6502). It applies fine to 4.1.1.rc2 in an intel macbook running 10..4.11 ( I could not get 4.1.1 to compile from source on that platform), so positive review from me again.
