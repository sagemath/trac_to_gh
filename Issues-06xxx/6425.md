This looks fine, it applies to 4.1.1 and the tests (in the directory modular/arithgroup) pass.

Suggestion:  there is already a function _normalize_H(H, level) which checks that H is a list, reduces its entries modulo the level, sorts and deletes 1 if present.  Why not add the gcd test in there?  I would not mak a lot of difference, but the code would be tidier that way.
