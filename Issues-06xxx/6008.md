This patch makes an improvement to the efficiency of elliptic curve torsion subgroup computation (over number fields).

I noticed something in the code I wrote which can be improved.  This
is something which was not in Chris Wuthrich's original
implementation, so it is my fault.

Here's what we do:  (1) find an upper bound on the torsion order, i.e.
a positive integer N such that the torsion order is certainly a
divisor of N.  This uses the function _torsion_bound() in
ell_number_field.py.    (2) For each prime dividing N, find a basis
for  the p-primary torsion.  This is done in
_p_primary_torsion_basis() in ell_generic.py.  (3) Put together the
primary parts.

Here's the inefficiency.  In step (2) I ignore the bound we have on
the exponent of each prime.  This wastes time in computing the
p-primary torsion basis.  So I will change the function
_p_primary_torsion_basis() to take an optional parameter which is a
bound on the  exponent of the order (not the exponent of the p-primary
subgroup).

e.g. in Jim's example, the bound is 49 and the actual torion is C7xC7. But when we compute the 7-primary torsion, after finding that the 7-torsion is complete and of order 49, we do not stop, but test 8 points in the 7-torsion subgroup to see if they can be divided further by 7.  that last part is obiously a waste of time since we have already reached the bound.

Before: Jim's example took 12.64s.  After: 9.73s.

The hunk in this patch changing `sage/version.py` needs to be removed before merging the patch since it will cause rejects and should have never been part of the patch to begin with ;)

Thanks for reopening - I think it is pretty clear in the trac guidelines not to close tickets, but it happens on occasion by new reviewers.

Cheers,
