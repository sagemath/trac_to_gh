This patch makes an improvement to the efficiency of elliptic curve torsion subgroup computation (over number fields).

I noticed something in the code I wrote which can be improved.  This
is something which was not in Chris Wuthrich's original
implementation, so it is my fault.

Here's what we do:  (1) find an upper bound on the torsion order, i.e.
a positive integer N such that the torsion order is certainly a
divisor of N.  This uses the function _torsion_bound() in
ell_number_field.py.    (2) For each prime dividing N, find a basis
for  the p-primary torsion.  This is done in
_p_primary_torsion_basis() in ell_generic.py.  (3) Put together the
primary parts.

Here's the inefficiency.  In step (2) I ignore the bound we have on
the exponent of each prime.  This wastes time in computing the
p-primary torsion basis.  So I will change the function
_p_primary_torsion_basis() to take an optional parameter which is a
bound on the  exponent of the order (not the exponent of the p-primary
subgroup).

e.g. in Jim's example, the bound is 49 and the actual torion is C7xC7. But when we compute the 7-primary torsion, after finding that the 7-torsion is complete and of order 49, we do not stop, but test 8 points in the 7-torsion subgroup to see if they can be divided further by 7.  that last part is obiously a waste of time since we have already reached the bound.

Before: Jim's example took 12.64s.  After: 9.73s.

Doctests all came out clean.

Moreover the example given took 71 seconds in 3.4.2 on my travel notebook before the patch and 62 seconds after the patch.

The hunk in this patch changing `sage/version.py` needs to be removed before merging the patch since it will cause rejects and should have never been part of the patch to begin with ;)

Thanks for reopening - I think it is pretty clear in the trac guidelines not to close tickets, but it happens on occasion by new reviewers.

Cheers,

Michael
