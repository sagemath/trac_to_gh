Unpickling elements of number field orders doesn't work:

```
sage: L = QuadraticField(-11,'a'); OL = L.maximal_order(); w = OL.0
sage: loads(dumps(w))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

```

With orders in higher-degree fields, I get a different error message:

```
sage: L = NumberField(x^3 - x - 1,'a'); OL = L.maximal_order(); w = OL.0
sage: loads(dumps(w))

```
(and the analogous thing for relative fields as well.)

This is a real problem because I am working on a computation where I need to be able to save results to disc, and this result is preventing me from loading what I've saved. (Elements of the fields rather than the orders unpickle OK, but it's next to impossible to prevent elements of the orders creeping in somehow when I pickle stuff.)
