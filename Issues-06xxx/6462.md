Unpickling elements of number field orders doesn't work:

```
sage: L = QuadraticField(-11,'a'); OL = L.maximal_order(); w = OL.0
sage: loads(dumps(w))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

```

With orders in higher-degree fields, I get a different error message:

```

sage: loads(dumps(w))

```
(and the analogous thing for relative fields as well.)

This is a real problem because I am working on a computation where I need to be able to save results to disc, and this result is preventing me from loading what I've saved.
