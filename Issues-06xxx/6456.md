We are shipping an *ancient* version of cvxopt in sage.  It's worse than Debian shipping sage-3.0.5!

Note that upgrading cvxopt should be fairly easy, since basically nothing in Sage depends on cvxopt.

New spkg: [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/cvxopt-1.1.3.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/cvxopt-1.1.3.spkg)
and the patch to use the interface to GLPK : [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6456/6456-cvxopt-glpk-interface.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6456/6456-cvxopt-glpk-interface.patch.gz)

Component: **packages: standard**

Author: **Harald Schilly, Dmitrii Pasechnik**

Reviewer: **Mike Hansen, Karl-Dieter Crisman**

Upstream: **Completely fixed; Fix reported upstream**

Merged: **sage-4.6.1.alpha2**

I've recently upgraded it for me to 1.1.2. The problem is, that the sources from them did not compile on my ubuntu 9.10 machine. So I went to the [ubuntu packges db for lucid](http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/python-cvxopt) and grabbed their version. I don't know what they did in their patch, but I guess it's non trivial...

My spkg is [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/schilly/sage/spkg/).

The only remaining modification I had to made to run the examples from the cvxopt website in `%python` mode was to replace 

```
from random import ...
```
to

```
from sage.misc.prandom import ...
```
in `./src/src/python/__init__.py` at several places.

**Q:**

1. what's the usual/best mechanism to avoid using Sage's `random` and switch back to python's random?!
2. i have no idea what the solaris patches did in the older version, neither do i know how to get it building on another system :(

sage -t  "devel/sage-work/sage/numerical/optimize.py"

bumps out essentially due to:

```

sage: from cvxopt import cholmod
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

ImportError: /home/dima/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/cvxopt/cholmod.so: undefined symbol: _g95_filename

Can you reproduce this on a stand-alone build of cvxopt?

Thanks, I knew that it is something with that! Works now!!! ;) 

I've uploaded [1.1.1.p2 here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/schilly/sage/spkg/)

Next I'll try if using the debian/ubuntu version of it was really necessary.

For everyone who wants to try this, don't forget that you have to disable the preparser in Sage via `preparser(False)` ... otherwise there are unknown types when you try to create a matrix with cvxopt's matrix command.

I think that really what remains to be done is to remove dependencies on 
obsolete fortrans (f77), see my other comment on this.
Let's get it done!

I don't see a necessity to try non-debian/ubunty version.
If you look at the debian patches, you see that all they changed is the source
were slight tweaks in setup.py

Does this mean that we should think of importing cvxopt's matrix into Sage under some other name? I don't know what the usual Sage's way to deal with such things, i.e. name clashes between packages, is.

no, but I can try on one of Skynet's machines (perhaps you can tell me which

You better check the license issue with William. Code should be GPL 2 or GPL2+, but there are exceptions if a package is optional and some other conditions - I've never fully understood  under what conditions code can be GLP 3. But you might find you can only use the latest version which is GPL 2, and not a GPL 3 version. 

```
sage: license()
```

says all code except jsmath is GPL2, and apparently jsmath is ok, as Sage does not link to it. 

The code will not build on skynet, as there are no SPARC machines there. It should build it on 't2' easily though. 

I suggest you download sage 4.3.0.1 from one of the mirrors

http://www.sagemath.org/download-solaris.html

Use the following settings. 

```
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $PATH
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/bin:/usr/local/bin2:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib:=/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib/sparcv9:/usr/local/lib
```

type make, and build Sage, then try your package. 

There is also a binary of Sage on the mirrors. You could download that. I'm not precisely sure what you then need to do to build just your package using the binary as a starting point. 

The latest Sage source will not build on Solaris, but 4.3.0.1 will.

Well, cvxopt is an optional package, so it must be in the same boat as jmath,
or some gap packages, that are also not GPL 2.

Yes, it is. Sorry, I was not aware of the existance of that machine. 

However, I do not know how the compilers and paths are configured on that machine. You need to have GNU make & GNU tar in your path before the Sun ones, and you need to have the Sun linker (/usr/ccs/bin/ld) in your path before any GNU ones. There are some general instructions on building Sage on Solaris at http://wiki.sagemath.org/solaris which you would need to follow. 

I've written some somewhat simpler instructions at http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/Building-Sage-on-the-T5240-t2 on how to build Sage on 't2'. They are simpler, as I have already put the right tools in the right locations. 

The Sun Blade 2500 (mark2) should be quicker than the T5240 (t2) at building Sage. However it would require some setting up of the build environment to build Sage. If you just want an easy solution, 't2' will just work, albeit not as quickly as the Sun Blade 2500.

I'm not however aware of anyone building Sage on there recently, so I don't know if the environment is set up suitably. Quite a few Solaris-specific changes have been made in the last year, and some of them might not be compatible with the build system on there. I don't know. Specifically, if 

```
gcc -v 
```

shows gcc was configured with the GNU linker, then the GNU linker must be in your path before the Sun linker. (Basically, whatever linker gcc uses, must be in your path first, as some code makes the assumption the first linker in your path is the one gcc uses, which might not be true.) I'm not aware of a foolproof test of this.

There should be something like 

```
--with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld
```
if the Sun linker was used, or 

```
--with-ld=/path/to/gnu/ld
```
if the GNU linker was used. 

Certainly, I've never had a problem with gnutls failing on 't2'.

I've emailed William to ask if you can have an account on t2, as that might be the simplest solution, though that Blade 2500 would be significantly faster than 't2'.

I can see your point about upgrading, though I'm not aware of any particular issues with the version in Sage. That version will build on Solaris. You could try appending /usr/sfw/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. I have known of issues with gnutls on OpenSolaris, but not on Solaris 10. 

I see your post about the GPL 3. That bit is sorted out then.

It's just that the name shouldn't have the .p3, the SPKG.txt is not correct (your name missing), the patches aren't yours but still mine and there is no mention what you have really done with the *.h files for solaris. where is a good page to read about the spkg policies?!?

Hello !!!

This patch applies, the spkg compiles fine and is well built, everything runs in the end and the doctest using it passes !!!

The only trouble I could find is the need to disable the preparser (mentionned by Harald earlier) to use regular CVXOPT scripts in Sage, but this is not new and could be adressed later. Clearly, this is an improvement for Sage :-)

Thank you for your work !!!

Nathann

P.S. : what would you think of creating another ticket to add a line about this perparsing bug somewhere there : http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/cvxopt.html ?

iirc we have removed documentation and examples. They are not exposed in any way or not used at all (tex sources).

I don't think this is ready to go in.  Some issues:

1. I don't think there should be a patches-old directory.  If people need them for historical reasons, then they should get them from the hg repo since that's what it is there for.

2. Files are modified in place in the src/ directory.  That should be as close to clean as vanilla upstream as possible.  The modified files should be copied over from patches/

3. In the patches directory, the patches should be unified diffs (diff -Naur).

4. In spkg-install, you should just remove the old, unnecessary code instead of just commenting it out.  Also, I don't think the SAGE_LOCAL check is necessary.

OK, this is clear. We need to check if we didn't nuke the old .hg/,
and put it back, if necessary.

I don't get this. Are you saying that patches cannot be just files that are ready to be copied, that they must be diffs, and the spkg-install must be patching rather than copying?

There is no file `src/src/C/sun_complex.h` so the first line just creates copies the file `/usr/include/complex.h` from Solaris to the patches directory. That file is from Sun, and its doubtful we can legally distribute `/usr/include/complex.h`

The second patch, patches/cvxopt.h differs from src/src/C/cvxopt.h by very little. A diff shows:

```

If I'm not mistaken, all these two patches achieve is to  

* Add a file `/usr/include/complex.h` to Sage taken from Solaris, that it is doubtful we can legally include, though I doubt Sun (now Oracle) will complain. 
* Change a file `patches/cvxopt.h` to include the file we have just illegally copied. 

It would to me at least be a lot easier to just change the second file so it had

```
#ifdef if defined __sun /* Need to check if that's the best one */ 
#include <complex.h>
#endif
```

Why are we bothering to copy a system file from Solaris, rather than just not use `#include <complex.h>`?

I tested it again and also tried to use glpk as an lp solver and it worked:

```
sage: from cvxopt import matrix, solvers
sage: c = matrix([-4., -5.])
sage: G = matrix([[2., 1., -1., 0.], [1., 2., 0., -1.]])
sage: h = matrix([3., 3., 0., 0.])
sage: sol = solvers.lp(c, G, h, solver='glpk')
GLPK Simplex Optimizer, v4.44
4 rows, 2 columns, 6 non-zeros
Preprocessing...
2 rows, 2 columns, 4 non-zeros
Scaling...
 A: min|aij| =  1.000e+00  max|aij| =  2.000e+00  ratio =  2.000e+00
Problem data seem to be well scaled
Constructing initial basis...
Size of triangular part = 2

dear release manager, please don't forget to include GLPL as a dependency for cvxopt in the spkg/standard/deps file according to [this comment](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9598#comment:3).

Are you sure its a good idea to merge the changes from #9598? IMHO, it would be better to make these tickets separate, as:

* #9598 has not been tested properly. 
* There is no documentation for the updates, so nothing to indicate that cvxopt can be used with the glpk solver.
* There are no additional doc tests which show the output of using cvxopt with the glpk solver. 
* The author does not know if it's platform dependent or not, and says he has only checked on OS X. 

I've marked #9598 as needs work, as based on what I deduce, it does need work before being what I personally consider acceptable.

I don't think that was such a good idea, as the documentation and the examples can be used to test the package. To quote from the `INSTALL` file. 

```
Test it:
--------
To test that the installation was successful, go to the examples
directory and try one of the examples, for example,

    $ cd examples/doc/chap8
    $ python lp
```

So if a spkg-check file was created, whilst leaving the documentation and examples in place, it would be possible to check this. 

Given there is only one .spkg which will be merged in 4.5.2, would it not be better to work on this a bit more? I can see some obvious things that could be improved. 

* Put back the examples and documentation. 
* Add an spkg-check file and test the examples - this will only happen if SAGE_CHECK=yes
* Try removing all the Solaris specific patches. I just did a **very** quick test on an OpenSolaris machine, and found this built without those patches. 
* Change the directory structure to what is standard in Sage, and not as it is now. 
* Remove the patches from #9598, which IMHO have not been checked carefully. 

I'll leave it up to you guys how you resolve it. If you want me to make a package based on that above, I'd be willing to do it.

Dave, it's just the question of turning a particular interface on.
There should be no problems --- most of all cause there is 0 exposure of
this to any Sage code at the moment.

The next step would be to have a proper test for this somewhere...

But my understanding is that there should be a test, so code like that in #9598 can't be committed until there is a test and documentation for it - I note that some documentation has now been added, though I'm not sure about test code. It does not seem right to me to link to a library when

* Whether the linking on some platforms is untested.
* The is no documentation to cvxopt to show how to use this library.
* There is no test code. 

(That was the situation at the time I marked it as needing work - that may have changed now). 

Note also that cvxopt does have test code, which is not executed. Since that was not before, I'm not suggesting that should be made conditional on getting a positive review. But given this ticket will not be merged in 4.5.2 (as only one .spkg file will be), it would seem wise to sort out that too, and run the package's self-tests. That would mean restoring the documentation and examples, as that is how this code gets tested. 

Sorry if I appear too pedantic, but I'm just trying to ensure that what we have works on all platforms, is tested on all platforms, and is documented properly.

Attachment: **[6456-freebsd-spkg-install.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6456/6456-freebsd-spkg-install.patch.gz)**

6456-freebsd-spkg-install.patch adds support for FreeBSD (this is a port of the patch in #9601).  I have compile-tested this but not yet tried to use the resultant module.

Note that further changes are necessary for cvxopt-1.1.2.p1.spkg to work on most 64-bit OSs.
Compiling in FreeBSD/amd64 (with or without the above patch) gives:

`Py_ssize_t` is typedef'd from `ssize_t`, which is `long` on at least FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris.  I believe this is a blocking issue.

While this builds on t2.math, it fails to build on mark (a skynet solaris machine).  Of course, the old version of cvxopt doesn't build on mark, either...

With either version, I get this, right at the start of the build:

John, what is the md5 checksum of the package you used? Where did you get it from? I took Dima's package 

 http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/cvxopt-1.1.2.p1.spkg

(md5 = 38681db8e19f69b0e7972c5278e8e183)

but get no such error message on t2.math (Solaris 10). I do notice a lot of unused variables, and other compiler warnings, which always make me a bit weary of code. 

I think in light of what Peter Jeremy has found, it would be foolish to not add an spkg-check file and execute the self-tests for cvxopt.

could it simply be that some -m64 or whatever flag settings to be added to spkg-install? 

It can very well be that the standalone cvxopt does not work on that fancy 64-bit systems anyway. If this is the case, I am not willing to do anything on this at this ticket.

sun_complex.h is in the current cvxopt spkg.
I added the sun_complex.h inclusion to 1.1.2 cause I was not able to make it work on t2 otherwise. So I just went with the solution that is known to work. 

Note that <complex.h> is included in cvxopt.h by default, albeit under some condition, etc.

If you have a better solution that works on t2, please post a patch here, and I make

I am also willing to put back examples and docs.

The current patch for Solaris does not work at all with gcc 4.5, as there's a syntax error in the code I wrote above, which you copied. 

This line is not legal C

```
#ifdef if defined __sun /* Need to check if that's the best one */
```

and gives a warning from the compiler

```
In file included from C/glpk.c:20:0:
C/cvxopt.h:30:11: warning: extra tokens at end of #ifdef directive
```

It then goes on to give an error message, as I suspect the header file <complex.h> does not get included. I suspect gcc is interpreting this as 

```
#ifdef if
```

I think we need the documentation and examples back, add an spkg-check file, and run all the self-tests. Unfortunately, I don't have time to do any of that now, though I can do it later today. (My wife is waiting on me to do some things in the house!)

Note Peter's problem is new to this upgrade, and the warning looks to me that it could cause a problem on any 64-bit system - irrespective of whether -m64 is added as a compiler flag. In fact, I doubt Peter ever uses -m64 in his builds on FreeBSD.

I've spent as long on this as I am able to for a while, so I thought I'd post what I have got. 

Note, that since 1.12 has never been merged into sage, this should be called 1.12 and not 1.12.p0, 1.12.p1 or similar. There's noting wrong with people adding a temporary letter or patch level if they want, but when its finally merged, it should not have all these temporary builds. 

I've created a package which builds on Solaris, but it fails all self-tests on Solaris.

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/cvxopt-1.1.2.spkg

It builds on Linux, but fails about half the self-tests on Linux.

To run the self-tests, type

```
$ export SAGE_CHECK=yes
$ ./sage -i http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/cvxopt-1.1.2.spkg
```

I've not committed any changes. 

I'm not sure what to make of this. I don't feel this is ready, given the high failure rate of the self-tests.

It's odd, since if I comment those lines out on OpenSolaris, it fails to build:

```

I think Dima's package 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/cvxopt-1.1.2.p1.spkg

has a syntax error in the patch, so that will fail on Solaris. But my own package 

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/cvxopt-1.1.2.spkg

lacks that syntax error. But it seems to be necessary to add patches on some version of Solaris and messes up the build on another. 

> I haven't tried building on t2 with this modification.

Do not be too surprised if you need to change it again!

I will need to double-check if the old version of cvxopt was building on OpenSolaris. I think it was, but #9525 shows that the package would report it had built, even if it failed. 

I've deleted my older builds on OpenSolaris but since I use a ZFS file system, with snapshots enabled every 15 minutes, so I can easily get back to an older build. Or I could just rebuild an older Sage on here, as it takes less than half an hour. I do need to check what's happening here. 

Unfortunately, the last few weeks I seem to be spending a lot of time trying to test things on Solaris for people. I've been involved in the cvxopt, Pari, Singular and some other package updates.

There are still currently some problems with the spkg.

- All of the .patch files are made in the wrong direction (i.e. removing Sage-specific code and adding generic code).

- On OSX, the package links against libgslcblas which is not what we want to do.  See #3435.  The blas libraries for OSX are found in `/usr/lib`.  We also don't build ATLAS on OS X.

That may be true. I don't know exactly what exists on sage.math. But many of the messages do not seem to indicate such a problem to me. Things like:

```
   from sage.misc.prandom import seed
   ImportError: cannot import name seed
```

does not look like a plotting problem or library to me. Would you agree?

Yes, I had noticed that, but given the large number of problems, it was only one in around 20 tests. I can easily change that, but it seems to be in the noise at the minute.

At the minute, this is certainly worst than the previous version on Solaris. 

The warning messages noticed by Peter look pretty serious to me and are new to this version. Those occur on any platform. 

I personally feel these issues should be resolved, otherwise we could end up making matters worst. If the upgrade does not get done properly now, it probably never will.

I do not consider an amd64/x86_64 system to be "fancy".  I suspect that anyone wanting to do serious work with Sage will be using a 64-bit system.

There is little point in upgrading to a package that is known to be broken.  This particular bug does not appear to be present in cvxopt-0.9 (at least I can't find the "incompatible pointer type" warnings in either my own or boxen builds) so by upgrading, we would be introducing a regression into Sage.  I am very concerned at this "release it now, we'll make it work later" mentality.

Did the previous version build on the Solaris host 'mark' on Skynet? 

> I'm not sure what syntax error you're referring to, but I don't see a difference in any of the files in the "patches" directory between your spkg and Dima's.

In a build log I see of yours on mark, there was a warning reported about extra items on line 30 (IIRC) of a header file. That came from the code

```
#ifdef if defined __sun /* Need to check if that's the best one */ 
```

which I typed above in this ticket, but appears to have been copied into one of the versions of this package. That code was incorrectly typed by me - it was put as a comment in this ticket, and I'd not checked it with a C compiler. It certainly does not what do what I had intended.

Agreed. 

I don't think some of the people commenting on the ticket realise what that warning is about. In fact, I personally feel gcc should consider that an error and not just issue a warning. I doubt the Sun compiler would permit that code.

Me neither. That bug is a regression.

Yes.

Me too. There is **far** too much emphasis in Sage of adding features and far too little in controlling quality. This ticket seems to be a prime example of that.

Yes.

I don't see any benefit in this. The only justification I can find mentioned in this thread for updating cvxopt is that the current version is "ancient". Unless someone comes up with a more compelling reason for updating, I would suggest sticking to the current spkg until problems with cvxopt-1.1.2 are resolved.

> * Contact the author, making him aware of the bug Peter found - i.e. passing 64-bit pointers when the code is expecting 32-bit ones. Also point out there are a lot of variables declared, which are never used.

To be precise, the code is passing pointers to 64-bit objects to functions expecting pointers to 32-bit objects.

I started to look at how difficult it would be to fix this morning but ran out of train journey before I got very far.

Also, whilst reading through the revision history for cvxopt, I notice that there have been a couple of changes that don't appear to be backward compatible: The `cvxopt.random` module was deleted in 0.9.2 and the definition of `bool(A)` (where `A` is a matrix) was changed in 1.1.

I am not aware of any Sage component that uses cvxopt. Surely, upgrading from 0.9 to 1.1 will break some code using cvxopt, but this is to be expected. The structure of the library has changed somewhat, so some imports might need to be fixed.

Regarding random, cvxopt has switched to using external random sources before 0.9.8, which is the currently used in Sage 4.5.1 spkg version. So I do not see why this is relevant at this point at all.

There is also little point in keeping 0.9.8 in Sage! It's next to impossible to use 0.9.8 for anything serious, as it's not supported, it is known to be buggy in one or another way (one can dig this up in cvxopt archives, if needed), there are no easy to find examples to look at for 0.9, etc etc etc.

Sticking to 0.9.8 is the same as having no cvxopt in Sage at all...

The pointer problem could potentially cause segfaults and data corruption. That's my single biggest concern. Not a single test passed on my Solaris build. 

There appears to be a split view on this ticket

* Those that want it updated for the functionality. 
* Those that don't want the current code updated because they feel it's a regression. 

How about making the updated version an optional or experimental package? (Personally I feel the latter is more appropriate). Those that feel they need the update can use it, whilst those that consider it makes Sage less stable will simply not bother installing it. 

I think Peter's comments about the: 

*"release it now, we'll make it work later" mentality*'

is very true here.

Why was 0.9.8 ever put in Sage if its so useless? 

Your comment about 0.9.8 being buggy is interesting. 

Version 1.1.2 is most obviously buggy.

Dave, 

your spkg-check is buggy. You probably end up calling a very wrong python to run the examples. E.g. if I cd to  
cvxopt-1.1.2/src/examples/doc/chap8
make a symbolic link mcsdp.py to mcsdp, fire up sage, and do

sage: load('mcsdp.py')

it happily runs without any errors etc. And this is one of examples your spkg-check fails on with weird error messages. So the problem does not seem to be in cvxopt here, but rather in your script...

Dima, 

I made it very clear that "I've spent as long on this as I am able to for a while, so I thought I'd post what I have got." I also made it clear I'd not committed the changes - a clear reflection I was not confident of them all. 

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6456#comment:58

If the wrong python is being called, that's a bug, as the first in the path, which is the one in Sage, should be called. One could work around that with "$SAGE_LOCAL/nib/python"

I'm aware of the issue with calling the .bin file, but as I remarked above, that's in the noise compared to the most significant issues of warnings from the compiler. 

Feel free to improve the test suite. Rather than execute them all in a loop, perhaps its better to cd to the directory and run them from there. But those changes are not going to get around the more serious issue, which is seen well before the test suite is run. 

I'm involved in many things at Sage at the moment. 

* This ticket
* #9343 - the upgrade of Pari, which is a non-trivial issue
* #9281 - trying to get more self-tests into Sage. 
* #8059 - update Singular SPKG to newest upstream release. Another big package

In addition, I've involved in same way with other less time consuming tickets

* #9533: Update GSL to the latest upstream release (1.14) & permit parallel building.
* #9568: Update IML to the newest upstream release, and improve spkg-install
* #9603: Force iconv to build + install on HP-UX. Currently it is only installed on Solaris and Cygwin.
 
I really don't have a huge amount of time to devote to this one. I'm less inclined to devote time to improving the self-tests on this package, as its clear the package is more seriously broken when its compiled. 

I seem to get cc'ed on a number of tickets where people can't be bothered to build on Solaris, so they think I will do the work for them. I'm tending to do that less now. There should be a much larger disk on t2 soon, so there will be even less excuse for people to pester me do do the Solaris checking. I never pester others other check code on Linux or OS X. I just do it myself. 

To be fair Dima, this is not aimed at you, as you have checked code on Solaris many times.

With all the comments above on this ticket, how many people have actually made an effort to test cvxopt on a few computers with a few different operating systems. Compare that with 

#9533: Update GSL to the latest upstream release (1.14) & permit parallel building.

where a lot of people have tested the code on multiple operating systems, with multiple compilers and run all the self-tests and run all the doctests on popular platforms. That's been done on 

* Cygwin
* FreeBSD
* HP-UX
* Linux
* OpenSolaris
* OS X
* Solaris

the following 2-byte change appears to cure the problem. Semantically, this 
restricts the dense matrices that are dealt with to the sizes 2^31 by 2^31, but this
is OK for all the practical purposes.
Hopefully CVXOPT people will come up with a better fix, but for the time being
this should suffice and cure this particular headache.

It remains to sort out the complex.h stuff on Solaris...

One of cvxopt developers has acknowledged this as a valid fix. Further, he says that it will get into a new cvxopt release, 1.1.3, due shortly.

I am inclined to wait for 1.1.3, while preparing an spkg-check starting off from Dave's version, and eventually sorting out OSX and Cygwin.
(and eventually hooking up the cvxopt's documentation to Sage's documentation)

Further, the Sun complex.h related issue, I looked at the /usr/include/complex.h over on t2 and mark. It just does not make sense how  _Imaginary_I is (not) defined there,
something like

```
#define _Imaginary_I _Imaginary_I
```
---no wonder it does not work. While it does make sense in the supplied patches/sun_complex.h, which differs from the former at this and few other places.

I set about trying to resolve why cvxopt would build on some Solaris systems but not on others. I believe I have finally got to the bottom of this. 

If one looks in the current cvxopt SPKG.txt file, there is a reference to this bug, and why the sun_complex.h was added. 

http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6549313

which does not appear to have any activity for more than 3 years. There's a little test program there, which I modified a bit to print good or bad:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <complex.h>

/*
 * "volatile" is meant to prevent gcc from calculating the sqrt as a
 * constant, we want to test libc.
 */
volatile complex double z = -_Complex_I;
int
main(void)
{
        z = csqrt(z);
        if (creal(z) > 0.0)
                printf("good\n");       /* good */
        else
                printf("bad\n");       /* bad */
}
```

After saving that to a file `test.c` I then tried to compile this using 

```
gcc -lm -std=c99 test.c  # Or in some cases using the Sun compiler.
```
in each case noting if the file compiled, or whether it gave an error like:

```
$ gcc -lm -std=c99 test.c
test.c:8: error: '_Complex_I' undeclared here (not in a function)
```
Assuming it did compile (which was the minority of cases), if that test program printed 'good' or 'bad' when it was run. 

Comparing different 12 systems I have access to, **sorted in order of the release date** of the operating system, this is what I found:

This problem with cvxopt on Solaris has become critical now, as there are no longer any compilers except gcc 4.5.0 on any of the Solaris machines. 

I've created a very small patch to fix the current version of cvxopt so it builds on Solaris. The #9657. I'd like to get that merged asap, as it is really a pain now we can't build on skynet,

We should get that patch upstream if possible. As you can see, it is very trivial. All we need to add to the upstream source is something like this. 

```
#include <complex.h>
#if defined(__sun__) && defined(__GNUC__)
   #if __GNUC__ < 4  || ( __GNUC__ == 4 && __GNUC_MINOR__ < 5   )

      #undef  _Complex_I
      #define _Complex_I (__extension__ 1.0iF)

      #undef I
      #define I _Complex_I

   #endif
#endif
```

There's no need to have a huge great header file as there is at the minute. It is totally unnecessary. One two items are missing from the header file, so only two need to be added. The patch currently add a very large proprietary header file when only a few lines of code are needed.

Why do you check for gcc here? I imagine with other compilers the problem
would be the same, too. (for the sake of reporting upstream...)
Is SunStudio 12 providing its own fix for this?

Otherwise I agree that this looks more pleasant than the current sun_complex.h hack;
I'll put it in the updated cvxopt 1.1.2 now.

The fix is not needed with the SunStudio compiler. I can compile a test program that uses `_Complex_I` with the Sun compiler without resorting to any hacks - see the big table above I produced. 
 
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6456#comment:85

In any case, I've not done much testing with SunStudio on this, so it would be unwise to start applying patches without testing them.

Yes, I think so too. gcc 4.5.0 creates a file with the fixed header, which I inspected. That is huge, looking similar to that the current patch in Sage. There's no need to repeat them all. And as I noted before, it is doubtful if its 100% legal to do so. All I did was copied the necessary parts. 

I did email the cvxopt developers about this, so hopefully it can be fixed upstream. You might not actually need the patch at all when 1.13 is released.

New spkg is here:
 http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/cvxopt-1.1.2.spkg

here is the list of goodies that got added/updated/fixed:
* applied P.Jeremy's FreeBSD patch
* corrected the 64-bit specific int* bug reported by pjeremy
* turned on GSL extension (this is the default mode for CVXOPT, and GSL is a standard Sage spkg, so
  this makes perfect sense); this in particular allowed to get rid of strange random seed-related
  import bugs uncovered by David Kirkby's spkg-check
  TODO(?): one might want to enchance the code to allow other Sage random sources,
   at the moment only GSL is used in CVXOPT-1.1.2 spkg, apparently it will need an unclear
   to me "with seed(..)" construct.
  TODO: We will need to make sure that CVXOPT is built after GSL
* modified spkg-check to report test names, cd to appropriate subdirs, and skip .bin files.
  TODO: add more tests.
* corrected the .patch files in patches/ to be in right order --- just run the makepatchfiles
  script to re-create these files!
* removed html doc files in src/doc; the .rst doc files are there, so it's a question of
  rebuilding them 
  (e.g. one can do sage -sh; cd src/doc; make html)
  TODO: incorporate docs buiding into spkg-install, and/or merge into 
  Sage documentation 
* included David's shortened and gcc-version targeted Sun-specific patch
  (comment 88); removed sun_complex.h  
* took care of SPKG.txt sections, as mentioned in comment 87

MAJOR change:
it now depends on GSL--- this gets rid of sage.prandom related problems

MAJOR TODOs:
MacOSX fixes, and testing with gcc-4.5 on as many platforms as possible
(otherwise it looks good to go !)

Dima

I've been to the pub tonight and have several beers. I think it's best if I don't start building anything now! 

But I'll look at that when I have sobered up a bit. 

Be aware, there is a ticket to update gsl #9533.

I tried your spkg on Sage 4.6.alpha1 (Debian x64), and it seems to work just fine.
That undefined symbol you got must really have something to do with your setup, not with the spkg
(moreover, noone reported something like this with my latest 1.1.2 spkg, while you have this problem with 1.1.2, as well)

I just tested it on MacOSX 10.5 PPC that uses g95, and it works just fine (not only the doctest in numerical/optimize.py, but also some of my code that uses other CVXOPT features).
Very good, as I feared this to be the major sticking point...

as I read on sage-devel, it's not a problem, as CVXOPT is not a part of sage-x.y.z.spkg. SPKG.txt merely reflects the CVXOPT's copyright notice, as given here:
http://abel.ee.ucla.edu/cvxopt/copyright.html
So we should not change SPKG.txt.

IMHO you're slightly misquoting. The text goes on there, and mentions more licences. Anyway.

Would you agree to the following text in SPKG.txt?

```

Although the LICENSE file starts by saying it is GPL3, read further down and you will find:

```
The CVXOPT distribution includes source code for a subset of the 
SuiteSparse suite of sparse matrix algorithms, including:

- AMD Version 2.2. Copyright (c) 2007 by Timothy A. Davis, Patrick R. 
  Amestoy, and Iain S. Duff.
- CHOLMOD Version 1.7.1 Copyright (c) 2005-2009 by University of Florida,
  Timothy A. Davis and W. Hager.
- COLAMD version 2.7.  Copyright (c) 1998-2007 by Timothy A. Davis.
- UMFPACK Version 5.4.0. Copyright (c) 1994-2009 by Timothy A. Davis.

These packages are licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public 
License, version 2 or higher (UMFPACK, the Supernodal module of CHOLMOD)
and the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or higher 
(the other CHOLMOD modules, AMD, COLAMD).  For copyright and license 
details, consult the README files in the source directories or the website 
listed below.
```

So there are multiple licenses.

IIRC, it was me who added those comments, though it might have been another package I'm thinking of.

Yes, it was me who added the comments - see my comments 3 months ago on this ticket. 

I don't see what the problem is though - Sage includes a lot of code licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License - e.g. MPIR recently changed to that.

I have some recollection that the cvxopt authors were going to incorporate my Solaris patch, so given this has ticket has been changed from using version 1.1.2 to using 1.1.3, I'm puzzled that does not appear to have happened. 

I'm more concerned we have made this use GLPK, but to the best of my knowledge, there's not a single doc test showing any example of how to use GLPK, so we have no idea of that functionality works at all.

Well, it depends what you mean with "multiple licences".  It is true that cvxopt **includes** code under GPLv2, LGPL2.1 but the package **as a whole** is licenced as GPLv3.  So as far as Sage is concerned, the licence is GPLv3+ and that's it.

Well, personally I don't think testing the **new** functionality should be left to a TODO. There's not a single test of the GLPK working with CVXOPT. We have made changes to allow them to be used together, but not tested that they actually work. I think that's bad practice myself. 

Would it take you long to write a few doctests which show how to use GLPK with CVXOPT?

Hi Dima, a few points:

* You have addressed most of the concerns I had 
  * The bug Peter found has been fixed. 
  * The Solaris/GCC bug has been resolved. 
  * There's now some doc tests testing the GLPK interface. 

* I personally don't have the maths knowledge to review this properly. 

If I understand this correctly, the default solver gives a result of 6.2499999 and GLPK gives 6.25. These two are very similar, so although I've got no idea what sort of relative error can be expected of the different solvers, intuitively it looks like the two solvers are agreeing with each other. 

I've got no idea if the answer is right though! Is there any theoretical reason for accepting these answers? Or is the answer accepted just because that what's the computer gives? If it was possible to compute this in another way (perhaps using Mathematica or something like that), or better still a theoretical explanation of why it is right, it would give me personally more confidence. I really dislike numerical results which are not substantiated in any way. 

Of course, we are using two solvers here, but part of the code is common. 

Another concern I have is that the doctest might not be too good across multiple platforms. It would never surprise me, if on another CPU, the GLPK solver gave something like 6.2499999 instead of 6.25. Making the doctest accept any value starting with 6.2 would be silly, as that could allow huge errors to pass. But I don't know how best to handle this. This seems a weakness in the way we doctest. Assuming the real answer is 6.25, we really want something that will accept any x such that abs(x-6.25) < 1e-6 or something like that. 

I don't know what this does on SPARC ('mark' or 'mark2' on skynet), but I'd not be too surprised if the answers came out slightly differently. My Sun you tested on is not a SPARC processor, but an Intel Xeon. 

Overall I'm a **lot** happier with this than I was a few months ago, but don't have the maths knowledge to review it properly and have some concerns about the numerical results for the doctest.

(the fact that `sol['s']*sol['z']` is 0.0 (well, with an acceptable error, for both solvers, although the default server could be tuned a bit better) is that complementary slackness condition in action)

But this is more coding, if done properly.
In fact, a function checking these should become a part of the library.
In this case, however, I am positive the answers are correct, and I can call myself an expert on this stuff :-)

Dima, 

I don't have the maths knowledge to fully understand all this, but you are an expert in this area, so I'm going to accept all what you say. 

I'm not convinced the GPLK doctest will necessarily pass on Solaris 10 SPARC systems, due to different rounding issues. As you note, GPLK does give an exact answer on my Intel system and your system. However, it's far from obvious this will give the exact answer on SPARC, due to differences in the rounding of the floating point processors. The Intel/AMD use 80-bits for intermediate calculations, whereas SPARC uses 64. All processors return their answers using 64-bits. 

If you can test this on a Solaris 10 SPARC system, showing the 

* The doctests pass 
* The package's set-test pass (set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` when building cvxopt)

then I'm willing to give this a positive review! You can use 'mark', 'mark2' or t2.math for testing on Solaris 10 SPARC. 

If you use t2.math, you can set `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/local/ATLAS32` which should mean that  ATLAS does not have to be built, so the build time will be significantly reduced. (I've just built the whole of Sage on t2.math, and have copied the necessary 32-bit ATLAS files to /usr/local/ATLAS32). I have not built Sage using those files, but I'm pretty confident that setting `SAGE_ATLAS_LIB` will work. If not, ATLAS will have to be built, but I doubt that will be necessary. So it should be possible to build Sage on t2.math in a few hours. 

Note Mercurial is not currently installed on t2.math, so it might be easier if you create a patched tar file and copy that over. I will install a new Python and Mercurial at some point on t2.math, but this is not yet set up. I only got t2.math working today after William messed it up. 

Sorry, I don't have time to test this myself, but if you can show the packages self-tests and the doctests pass on Solaris 10 SPARC, I'll give this a positive review. 

The ticket has been open for 17 months, but it should be possible to get a positive review in well under 17 hours! 

Dave

It does. There is not SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libcblas* on MacOSX PPC (however linking works for me on MacOSX 10.5 PPC)
Please try the new, just updated, spkg. (Both on PPC and on MacOSX x86, if possible).

no, they don't exist on MacOSX PPC! I don't know about MacOSX Intel, as I don't have such a machine yet.
Moreover, on my 10.5 PPC linker is not bothered by nonexistence of these libraries.
So this is an artefact of old hard- and soft-ware. What a bloody mess...
Could you tell me the result of the following on your 10.4:

```
$ sage -python
>>> import os
>>> os.uname()
```
so that  I can code this into setup.py of the package...

Maybe that helps.  Where does libcblas come from in other systems?  It's not a Sage package, and the BLAS spkg-install only installs libblas.a, as far as I can tell.

if they should all be in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`, then I have 

```
 liblapack.a
 libgsl.a       
 libgsl.dylib   
 libgsl.la      
 libgslcblas.a
 libgslcblas.dylib
 libgslcblas.la
 libblas.a     
 ```

sure, I have the same.

These are platform-optimised libraries, that should be used on MacOSX.
So your linker trouble seems to be a sign of Xcode not being properly installed, or that your Xcode is much older than mine, and the directories layout has changed.

Do you have anything like this in /usr/lib ?

But anyway, one just have to link against the native libraries.
What does your gcc -v say? In my case:

```
$ gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
Target: powerpc-apple-darwin9
Configured with: /var/tmp/gcc_42/gcc_42-5577~1/src/configure --disable-checking --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --enable-languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/$/-4.2/ --with-slibdir=/usr/lib --build=i686-apple-darwin9 --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.0.0 --program-prefix= --host=powerpc-apple-darwin9 --target=powerpc-apple-darwin9
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577)
```
So you see with-slibdir=/usr/lib there, so this must mean that it picks up these libcblas, etc, there.

I tested sage/numerical/ and got only a couple failures, but they look ominous - all of this type, where it can't find a symbol with g95.  Which is weird, because of course I used G95 to compile this Sage.

well, an old gcc toolchain (?): g95 somehow doesn't know where to look for its own libf95.a
(it worked for me, also with g95...)
This should be fixed in  just uploaded update of  the spkg.
Could you please test it?

(also, if it builds, could you try building it with SAGE_CHECK=yes, too ?)

Just tested on t2, on Sage 4.6, with SAGE_CHECK=yes, and the tests in sage/numerical/optimize.py, all works.
(Actually, it already worked on PPC, which is also not an 80-bit floating point, but only 64...)

Now waiting for OSX 10.4 results, and hopefully MacOSX Intel, too.

With `SAGE_CHECK=yes` I get a whole bunch of errors, all looking for the same thing - like this one:

```
Error: /Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.6/local/bin/python l2ac.py failed
Testing  robls.py ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "robls.py", line 5, in <module>

  Referenced from: /Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.6/local/lib//libgsl.0.dylib

```
All of these ask about `_cblas_zhemm`.

Testing sage/numerical gives me all tests passed, though.

Is there any other part of Sage which would conceivably depend on these changes at all?  Testing the whole thing on this computer would take until Monday.

Do you have an account on bsd.math? If not, ask William for one. That is not a speed daemon, but its an Mac with an Intel CPU running 10.6. It takes a few hours, but not days to test Sage on that.

Most probably this is due to missing gslcblas in the list of libraries to link. I've put it back in and uploaded the updated
spkg. Please test! (with SAGE_CHECK=yes, naturally).
Thanks.

No, there is no need to test anything else; the only exposure to cvxopt is in sage/numerical/optimize.py.

I got an account on bsd.math and tested on OSX 10.4 Intel. I had to change the way the package detects which fortran compiler is used, so this is now done without resorting to checking for platforms (Darwin, etc) at all.
So after these changes it tested OK on OSX10.4 Intel, OSX10.5 PPC, Solaris (t2) and Debian x64.
The updated version is uploaded.

At any rate, a test on OSX 10.6 would be great to have.

bsd.math runs 10.6, not 10.4.  You might have been confused because of the output of "uname", more particularly "uname -r":

```
bsd:~ palmieri$ uname -r
10.4.0
```
The "10" corresponds somehow to OS X 10.6, and the "4" means it's running OS X 10.6.4.  (OS X 10.4 would return "8.???" and OS X 10.5 would return "9.???".)

Why the hell do the operating systems do this. Solaris is just as bad. 

This is Solaris 10

```
kirkby@t2:64 ~$ uname -r
5.10
```

and AIX 6.1

```
$ uname -r
1
$ uname -a
AIX lpar5 1 6 00C6B7C04C00
```

Linux is no better 

```
kirkby@sage:~$ uname -r
2.6.24-28-server
```

I can't recall if HP-UX is a bit more sensible, and can't be bothered to switch on my HP-UX machine to find out.

Of course!

I have a brief question about the patches.  The Solaris one and the init one seem fine, and most of the setup.py makes sense for finding Sage-specific things.  

I do have a question about `BUILD_GLPK` being set to 1, since there is a comment that one can only do this if glpk is installed, "optional at this moment".  So will this cause problems?  Apparently not... There is a hanging parenthesis there as well.   Anyway, I'd like to know what that is about.

Also, in SPKG.txt there is a spelling "enchance" instead of "enhance", and "recongnision" instead of "recognition".

Everything else seems to make sense, though I should note I am not a shell script or install expert :)  Still, with no problems reported on 4.6.1.alpha2, perhaps it's time for positive review once those things get resolved.

I thought this had been debated on sage-devel before, and William's opinion is that it should not be .p0. There's noting in the Sage Developers Guide to say it should be either. As such, I don't think that this is a reasonable reason for putting the ticket to needs work.

I believe the opposite, and was specifically indoctorinated into my belief when I was updating GAP and its GAP-packages spkgs.
Hereby I blatantly change the status to Positive Review :-)
