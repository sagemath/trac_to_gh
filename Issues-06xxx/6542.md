The patch fixes a mistaken deletion of critical functionality in tachyon's tostr function.  Looks like a piece of this function was sliced off by mistake during the colorsys refactoring.

I will open a seperate ticket to improve the tachyon doctests; I think this patch should go in ASAP since tachyon is totally broken without it.

True; I just meant to add a string with doctest that 

```
tostr([5,4,3])
' 5.0 4.0 3.0 '
```
as per Sage convention to check that it was fixed; that shouldn't be too bad.  I'd do it myself but do not have a current Sage build available.

Yes, I've been thinking about doing this for a while too.
