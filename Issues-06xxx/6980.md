**Attachment:** [trac6980_nonzero_positions_by_column.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6980/trac6980_nonzero_positions_by_column.patch.gz)

After patching, we obtain what is expected:

```
sage: time matrix(ZZ,5000,sparse=True)._nonzero_positions_by_column()
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
