Actually, i guess it is documented.  However, I consider it a serious design flaw.
Many thanks for pointing this out!!

I consider this a serious design flaw for the following reasons:

 (1) it is too hard to understand the above behavior, since it depends on the hash values symbolic variables, which might possibly be system-dependent.

 (2) it is totally inconsistent with the behavior for symbolic expressions, where things are done right.

 (3) it is totally inconsistent with the behavior of *homomorphisms*, where things are also done right.

Here is a session to illustrate the above points:

# BAD
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: g=x+y
sage: g.subs({x:x+1,y:x*y})
x*y + x + y + 1

# BAD
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: g=x+y
sage: g.subs(x=x+1,y=x*y)
x*y + x + y + 1

# GOOD
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: phi = R.hom([x+1,x*y])
sage: g=x+y
sage: phi(g)
x*y + x + 1

# GOOD
sage: var('x,y')
sage: g = x+y
sage: g.subs({x:x+1,y:x*y})
x*y + x + 1

# GOOD
sage: var('x,y')
sage: g = x+y
sage: g.subs(x=x+1,y=x*y)
x*y + x + 1
        

> What should be done to this?

1. I suggest that for now you use Hom, as illustrated above, as a workaround.  

2. I think subs should be reimplemented using Hom ASAP.  Note that this could break existing code, so will have to be done carefully.    We can leave the old behavior in for speed, but as a non-default option.

3. Come up with a fast way to implement the new behavior.

the main use-case for which I wrote it is (which **must** be fast):

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: g=x+y
sage: %timeit g.subs({x:2,y:1})
10000 loops, best of 3: 62.9 µs per loop
```

The performance for elements in R is:

```
sage: %timeit g.subs({x:x+1,y:x*y})
10000 loops, best of 3: 153 µs per loop
```

However, to my surprise `hom` is faster:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[]
sage: phi = R.hom([x+1,x*y])
sage: g=x+y
sage: %timeit phi(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 45.8 µs per loop
```


Is it because it caches or is really just better code?

Hom is implemented by Singular when the base ring is a singular ring. 

```
sage: R.<x,y>=GF(next_prime(10^9))[]
sage: phi = R.hom([x+1,x*y])
sage: g=x+y

sage: phi = R.hom([x+1,x*y])

sage: print type(g)
sage: timeit('phi(g)')
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element.MPolynomial_polydict'>

So it is `_im_gens_` in `MPolynomial_libsingular` then (sorry for not checking myself earlier). 

It seems the most straight-forward implementation possible including the comment `#TODO: very slow` in `_im_gens_` wins for small examples, but for bigger ones we get:

```
sage: P.<a,b,c,d,e> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = P.random_element(degree=3,terms=50)
sage: g = {a:b,b:c,c:d,d:e,e:a}
sage: %timeit f.subs(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 138 µs per loop
```

```
sage: phi = P.hom([b,c,d,e,a])
sage: %timeit phi(f)
1000 loops, best of 3: 893 µs per loop
```

To emphasize the point, here is the result after applying the patch:

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[] 
sage: g=x+y 
sage: g.subs({x:x+1,y:x*y}) 
x*y + x + 1
sage: g.subs({y:x*y, x:x+1})
x*y + x + 1
```

Note that things are *not* in order in the second example.

I think this is probably hopeless as stated.  If the substitutions were given as a list of tuples, then you could depend on the order.  In other words, if you had something like `g.subs([(y,x*y), (x,x+1)])` then you could say something about doing the substitutions in order.  Or even if you did something like `g.subs((y,x*y), (x,x+1))` you could do something in order, since *args is a list that preserves the order of the arguments.

I think that this patch should get a positive review.  The behavior after the patch is the correct behavior and is consistent with the rest of Sage.
