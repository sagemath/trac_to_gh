NO.  Pari has no functionality at all for doing anything nontrivial with multivariate polynomials.    Do b.factor?? to see the source.  Sage tries to convert b to a poly over QQ, this works, then it calls SINGULAR to factor that.  If conversion doesn't work, it falls back to Maxima right now. 

All the time is actually spent in converting b to Singular:

sage: timeit('c = b.polynomial(QQ)')
5 loops, best of 3: 149 ms per loop

It is silly that this is slow.  I don't know why it is so slow. 

It's the conversion itself not the tree walk:

+NO.  Pari has no functionality at all for doing anything nontrivial with multivariate polynomials.    Do b.factor?? to see the source.  Sage tries to convert b to a poly over QQ, this works, then it calls SINGULAR to factor that.  If conversion doesn't work, it falls back to Maxima right now.

+All the time is actually spent in converting b to Singular:

+sage: timeit('c = b.polynomial(QQ)')
+5 loops, best of 3: 149 ms per loop

+It is silly that this is slow.  I don't know why it is so slow.
