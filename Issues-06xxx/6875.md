The fill option for polar_plot does not work correctly anymore.

The following two doctests don't produce the supposed output:

* Fill the area between two functions:

```
sage: polar_plot(cos(4*x) + 1.5, 0, 2*pi, fill=0.5 * cos(4*x) + 2.5, fillcolor='orange').show(aspect_ratio=1)
```

* Fill the area between several spirals:

```
sage: polar_plot([(1.2+k*0.2)*log(x) for k in range(6)], 1, 3 * pi, fill = {0: [1], 2: [3], 4: [5]})
```

This regression has been introduced with the changeset 12287 (Ticket: #5930).

Sage really needs a test framework for plots. Otherwise more and more regressions will creep in, without anybody noticing.

I've attached two images with the correct output of the two examples.
Is this what you get with the patch?

I compiled a fresh version of 4.1.1.alpha1 overnight, and everything seems to work on that.  So positive review!

(Note to everyone else: the functions above were already in the doctests, but just were not working).

I wish this would have been working last week when I taught finding areas in polar coordinates! I'm glad you found the fix.
