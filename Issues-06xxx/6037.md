Looks nice. For the record, the following exported member functions (of QuadraticForm) have been renamed/removed:
- `reindex_vector_from_extraction` was removed
- `count_modp__by_gauss_sum` was renamed to `count_modp_solutions__by_Gauss_sum`.
- `local_good_density_congruence_even__experimental` was removed.
- `VecIncrement__deprecated` was removed.
- `local_solution_type__deprecated` was removed.
- `CountAllLocalTypesNaive__deprecated` was removed.
- `count_local_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions`.
- `count_local_good_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__good_type`.
- `count_local_zero_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__zero_type`.
- `count_local_bad_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type`.
- `count_local_bad_typeI` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type_I`.
- `count_local_bad_typeII` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type_II`.
- `local_good_density` was removed.
- `local_zero_density` was removed.
- `local_bad_density` was removed.
- `local_badI_density` was removed.
- `local_badII_density` was removed.

I think the `__deprecated` and `__experimental` functions need no comment. For the renamed functions, though, it may be nice to add a compatibility wrapper with deprecation warning... (where and how?)

Jon, internal routines should be using names starting with an underscore (that's the python convention).
