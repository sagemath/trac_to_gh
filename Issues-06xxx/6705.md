Code in ATLAS can not detect the processor type on machines like the Sun T5240 ('t2') as it 

This has been passed upstream

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2825994&group_id=23725&atid=379483

but there is no fix yet. I probably have enough information to fix this, but have not done so yet.

If I run `./sage -f -m spkg/standard/atlas-*.spkg` on t2, where can I find the tuning parameters under `spkg/build/atlas-*`?  Can we include them in an updated ATLAS package?  I assume this will speed up the build, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Is there a system on which ATLAS does build / tune successfully in parallel?
