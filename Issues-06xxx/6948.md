Nice, but does it actually fix the examples provided?  

```
sage: exp(a)^(1/2)
sqrt(e^a)
```
I guess that's okay.  But

```
sage: exp(a)^(1/3)
e^a^(1/3)
sage: exp(a^(1/3))
e^(a^(1/3))
```
I think there are missing parentheses in the first example, particularly because it's not typeset.   Even if that is a convention, which I'm not so sure of, the dictum is that it's better to be explicit.  

I also get a doctest failure (not mentioned in the Pynac upgrade ticket) in product and quotient rule differentiation in calculus/tests.py, but it looks like that's the one in #6524, so it's properly speaking another issue, I guess.
