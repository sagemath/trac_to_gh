To facilitate the learning of cryptography (in particular the Advanced Encryption Standard), it's a good idea to add a class to allow students to explore the working of a block cipher. The goal here is to implement the Mini-AES block cipher of Phan as described in the paper:

R. C.-W. Phan. Mini advanced encryption standard (mini-AES): a testbed for cryptanalysis students. Cryptologia, 26(4):283--306, 2002.

This is a simplified variant of the AES to be used for cryptography education.

Mini-AES and the simplified AES variant by Musa, Schaefer, and Wedig have been designed for teaching purposes.

What I want to do with the patch is to implement a variant of the AES that fits in with Neal Koblitz's idea of Kid Krypto, where one should not require too much advanced maths to describe the working of a cryptosystem. Each method of the class `MiniAES` is designed so that a student can follow through the whole processes of encryption and decryption, one step at a time. But the class also has a callable that a student can use to perform encryption or decryption in one step.

`mq.SR` does not really make use of the S-Box class (since the S-Box is so structured). Have a look at `mq.SBox` (a weird place for that class, I know), it seems it would be useful for your purposes. Also, this class also gives you difference distribution tables etc. for free.

Btw.   ``\text{GF}(2^4)`` should now be ``\GF{2^4}``.

That can be arranged.

You read my mind. I forgot to add that. Man, it's early in the morning over here :-)

Let's leave them in for now and see how users react.

The methods `encrypt` and `decrypt` are meant to deal with only 16-bit blocks of data, so they're very limited in the length of their input. As their input are matrices over a finite field, I think the structure of the input and output mimics how a student would go through the encryption/decryption by hand. If they rather work with integers than finite field elements, they could use the provided conversion methods.

The callable `__call__` is designed for performing encryption/decryption in one go, operating mainly on binary strings. So once someone is comfortable with how Mini-AES works, they can encrypt binary strings longer than 16 bits in length, which is at present not possible with the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods. You can think of `__call__` as being there to do Mini-AES encryption/decryption on arbitrary data, while `encrypt` and `decrypt` aid in understanding the corresponding processes on a small scale, i.e. on 16-bit blocks.

I'm not sure. It's meant as a specification of the decryption process.




> * Maybe http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/misc.html#dir-tabularcolumns is a good alternative to LaTeX tabular for readability?
 
Sure. Let me try that one for a change.

Fixed the following issues raised by malb:
* Mini-AES is now under the directory `sage/crypto/block_cipher`
* add the function `sbox()` to return the S-box of MiniAES

I still use LaTeX markup for tables, as the `tabularcolumns` tag of Sphinx doesn't give the effect I want, at least I can't figure out how to do so.
