The latest matplotlib we have in Sage is 0.99, though.  It's in 4.1.2 already.  See #5448 for the spkg.

I was just going to update the spkg to have 0.99.1, which was just pre-announced on matplotlib-devel (barring any problems) as svn 7813.

So at bare minimum, the spkg above needs to use the spkg from #5448.  Ondrej, if you want to update to 0.99.1, that would be great too.  0.99.1 obsoletes several of the patches in the spkg, as they've been merged upstream.

I'll do so. I don't know why I used 0.98.5. I will first build femhub with this tonight and if all works, update matplotlib and see if I can fix that one too.
