Thumbs up from me. The patch successfully applied to my 4.0 install and the tests in integer.pyx pass.

This patch is important for mpmath performance (#6196). Time for sage.libs.mpmath.all.runtests() without patch = 63.66 seconds, with patch = 51.88 seconds.

I'm definitely happy with this patch. As Robert points out in the patch, there are a few inconsistencies in some of the `integer.pyx` code -- for instance, there are the incongruously named `_lshift` and `_rshift_`, which are basically the same and are barely used. I've removed them, cleaned up the bits of code that used them, and made one or two (morally) small changes to Robert's `_shift_helper` code, such as some comments and more error checking.

Interestingly, I'm having some funny results using `timeit` vs. `%timeit`, namely that `timeit` tends to be inconsistent on timings this tiny:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 11
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 200 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 323 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 371 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 360 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 360 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 370 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 368 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 418 ns per loop
```

As you can see, it's generally around `368 ns`, but the timings have several outliers. But IPython `%timeit` thinks the fast outlier is the **correct** value!

```
sage: %timeit a << b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 188 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a << b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 187 ns per loop
```

I tend to trust it, because it's running a ton of loops -- maybe the fact that my computer is doing several things at once is disturbing `timeit`?

Anyway, new patch attached. Robert, if you could look over the changes, I'd say this is a positive review. It seems to give me a nominally faster (around `5%`) timing than the previous version, but that's probably just my computer being weird.

Also, why do 

```
if n < 0: 
    n *= -1 
    sign *= -1 
```

rather than 

```
n *= sign
```

sage: %timeit a << b

sage: %timeit a >> b

10000000 loops, best of 3: 190 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a << c
1000000 loops, best of 3: 222 ns per loop
```

and after the second patch 

```
sage: sage: a = 5; b = 6; c = 6r
sage: sage: %timeit a << b
1000000 loops, best of 3: 192 ns per loop

With repeated timings, the variance seems to be about 5 or so ns. The only significant differences are that Integer >> Integer is a bit faster with the second patch, and Integer << int and Integer >> int are faster with the first. 

I'm (pleasantly) surprised making it a cpdef function didn't slow it down. I don't think `shift_helper` needs to do error checking, and it seems odd to introduce a new auxiliary variable `normalize_Integer`.

I got some hunk failures when applying `trac-6118-pt2.patch`:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6118/trac-6118-pt2.patch && hg qpush
adding trac-6118-pt2.patch to series file
applying trac-6118-pt2.patch
patching file sage/rings/integer.pxd
Hunk #1 FAILED at 15
1 out of 1 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/integer.pxd.rej
patching file sage/rings/integer.pyx
Hunk #1 FAILED at 4363
Hunk #2 FAILED at 4405
Hunk #3 FAILED at 4417
Hunk #4 FAILED at 4434
Hunk #5 FAILED at 4443
5 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/rings/integer.pyx.rej
patch failed, unable to continue (try -v)
patch failed, rejects left in working dir
Errors during apply, please fix and refresh trac-6118-pt2.patch
```
This needs a rebase against Sage 4.1.2.alpha1 or a later version.
