Thumbs up from me. The patch successfully applied to my 4.0 install and the tests in integer.pyx pass.

This patch is important for mpmath performance (#6196). Time for sage.libs.mpmath.all.runtests() without patch = 63.66 seconds, with patch = 51.88 seconds.

I'm definitely happy with this patch. As Robert points out in the patch, there are a few inconsistencies in some of the `integer.pyx` code -- for instance, there are the incongruously named `_lshift` and `_rshift_`, which are basically the same and are barely used. I've removed them, cleaned up the bits of code that used them, and made one or two (morally) small changes to Robert's `_shift_helper` code, such as some comments and more error checking.

Interestingly, I'm having some funny results using `timeit` vs. `%timeit`, namely that `timeit` tends to be inconsistent on timings this tiny:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 11
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 200 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 323 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 371 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 360 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 360 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 370 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 368 ns per loop
sage: timeit("a << b")
625 loops, best of 3: 418 ns per loop
```

As you can see, it's generally around `368 ns`, but the timings have several outliers. But IPython `%timeit` thinks the fast outlier is the **correct** value!

```
sage: %timeit a << b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 188 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a << b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 187 ns per loop
```

I tend to trust it, because it's running a ton of loops -- maybe the fact that my computer is doing several things at once is disturbing `timeit`?

Anyway, new patch attached. Robert, if you could look over the changes, I'd say this is a positive review. It seems to give me a nominally faster (around `5%`) timing than the previous version, but that's probably just my computer being weird.

I just realized this touched integer.pxd, so some comments first. We care about shifting by ints a lot because library code (especially mpmath) does a lot of stuff like "x << 1". I think the patch may make that path slower. Also, the error checking and cpdefing may make it slower too (I'll test, might be negligible). 

Also, why do 

```
if n < 0: 
    n *= -1 
    sign *= -1 
```

rather than 

```
n *= sign
```

and after the second patch 

```

With repeated timings, the variance seems to be about 5 or so ns. The only significant differences are that Integer >> Integer is a bit faster with the second patch, and Integer << int and Integer >> int are faster with the first. 

I'm (pleasantly) surprised making it a cpdef function didn't slow it down. I don't think `shift_helper` needs to do error checking, and it seems odd to introduce a new auxiliary variable `normalize_Integer`.

I also removed the one extra error check in `_shift_helper` and made a note about it. \n\nOne last question, though -- do we really need the case where `y = ZZ(y)` raises a `ValueError`? Looking at the `Integer` constructor, this seems to only happen when we're given a string in a base larger than 36; in this case, the code in the `except` clause won't work, anyway. So are there other cases where this is used that I'm not thinking of? (It's obviously not too important, but I'm curious.)",

Attachment: **[trac-6118-pt2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6118/trac-6118-pt2.patch.gz)**

I've added a new version of the second patch, which mostly just adds comments and removes the inconsistencies with things like `_lshift` and `_rshift_`. 

In particular, I've come around to Robert's point that we want to speed up the `Integer << int` and `Integer >> int` cases the most -- I just did a `search_src('>>')`, and there seems to be a lot of code that shifts by literals (which will be Python `int`s). I also removed the one extra error check in `_shift_helper` and made a note about it. 

One last question, though -- do we really need the case where `y = ZZ(y)` raises a `ValueError`? Looking at the `Integer` constructor, this seems to only happen when we're given a string in a base larger than 36; in this case, the code in the `except` clause won't work, anyway. So are there other cases where this is used that I'm not thinking of? (It's obviously not too important, but I'm curious.)

I think that Craig's patch looks good, and his question shouldn't really hold this up.  I'll open a new ticket for that so that these can go in.

This needs a rebase against Sage 4.1.2.alpha1 or a later version.
