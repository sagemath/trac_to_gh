If you used the `@cached_method` decorator when defining a function in the Sage library, then get help about it (either in the notebook or command line), the File: field lis as follows:

```
File:           /.../local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/cachefunc.py
```

That's of course technically right, but very wrong/misleading for the user, who maybe wants to know more.  We should add specialized code to IPython and the notebook to correct for this.

This problem has already been fixed (by some work in sage.misc.sageinspect - sorry, I am too lazy to look up the ticket number). For example:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x,y]
sage: I.groebner_basis?
Type:           CachedMethodCaller
Base Class:     <type 'sage.misc.cachefunc.CachedMethodCaller'>
String Form:    Cached version of <function groebner_basis at 0x1507b18>
Namespace:      Interactive
Loaded File:    /home/simon/SAGE/sage-5.0/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/cachefunc.so
Source File:    /home/simon/SAGE/sage-5.0/devel/sage/sage/misc/cachefunc.so
Definition:     I.groebner_basis(self, algorithm='', deg_bound=None, mult_bound=None, prot=False, *args, **kwds)
Docstring:
    File: sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py (starting at line 3476)
...
```

Hence, we can close this.
