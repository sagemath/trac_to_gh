In the [Sage Notebook Bugreports](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA), there is a report of an error with typesetting Laurent series elements:

```
sage: R.<a,b>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: T.<x>=LaurentSeriesRing(R)
sage: latex(a*x+b*x)
'a + bx'
```
It ought to be (a+b)x, but the parentheses are missing.  The attached patch should fix this.

Before the patch:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-09                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: R.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: T.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(R)
sage: y = a*x + b*x
sage: y._latex_()
'a + bx'
sage: latex(y)
a + bx
```
After the patch:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1.1.rc0, Release Date: 2009-07-29                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
*                                                                    *

sage: y = a*x + b*x
sage: y._latex_()

sage: latex(y)

```
Note that one can also obtain the LaTeX representation of an object through the `latex()` function. So I'm attaching a patch on top of John's that also calls that function. If John is OK with the patch `trac_6656-reviewer.patch`, then the ticket has positive review from me.
