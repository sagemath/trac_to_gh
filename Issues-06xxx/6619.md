Those examples did not pass due to a typo in the code.

```
            sage: IV = IntegerVectors(3,10,inner=[4,1,3], min_part = 2)
            sage: min_length, max_length, floor, ceiling, min_slope, max_slope = IV._parameters()
            sage: floor(1), floor(2), floor(3)
            (4, 2, 3)

            sage: IV = IntegerVectors(3, 10, outer=[4,1,3], max_part = 3)
            sage: min_length, max_length, floor, ceiling, min_slope, max_slope = IV._parameters()
            sage: ceiling(1), ceiling(2), ceiling(3)
            (3, 1, 3)
```
