This is an upgraded optional package for gap-4.4.12, as in #6348.
This spkg applies fine to 4.0.2.rc1 and all related failures in sage -testall -optional are fixed in the patch in #6348.

The command "newest-version gap" mentioned in the old spkg-install script is broken. I was unable to locate that script, so I slightly modified the spkg-install so it would compile the binaries correctly.

They were from both database_gap and gap_packages. I have database_gap-4.4.10 installed and the spkgs here and from #6348 on Sage 4.1. These might be related although I don't get errors from gap-4.4.12. It probably doesn't make sense to worry about this until #6348 is cleared up. The full log is attached.

All I can say is that they worked fine for me when I posted them. I agree that it is a waste of time
to work on this until #6348 is cleared up.
