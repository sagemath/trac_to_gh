Attach to this ticket some of the fixes for getting Sage to build on OS X 10.6 (the new release of OS X).

Note that a Sage build on OS X 10.5 does seem to work fine on 10.6, but Sage does not "just build" on 10.6.

1. We upgrade readline to 6.0, since 5.2 doesn't build on OS X 10.6:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/tmp/readline-6.0.spkg

or

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/readline-6.0/readline-6.0.spkg


This new spkg needs to be reviewed and build tested on Linux and OS X 10.4. (I tested it on 10.5.)


* Boehm GC -- fixed at trac #6969

* ECL fails to build (for same reasons to Boehm GC) -- fixed at trac #6971

* R  -- see trac #6972

* MPIR -- see trac #7006 -- this is needed if one tries to build without specifying 64-bit explicitly on a 64-bit platform.

* Fortran -- see trac #6981, in particular .p8, which is critically needed to build if one does not specify SAGE64="yes".

* Matplotlib font cache issue -- see trac #7022

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/readline-6.0/readline-6.0.spkg

which addresses this, but also does some other things that are not necessarily necessary for readline, but which can be helpful in general, to make a more robust spkg. 

* Upgrade to 6.0 (latest upstream) - see trac #6849
* Remove numerous ugly build hacks needed only on OS X for older readline.
* Track #6844 Made a test for /etc/SuSE-release, as the previous spkg-install
  greped on it, which generates a warning if the file does not
  exist, which it will not on most peoples systems.
* Added '-m64' to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS and F77FLAGS
  if SAGE64 is set to 'yes'. I'm aware it is not necessary to do
  all of these in readline, but its better to stick to something that
  works on all packages.
* Removes -m64 as a linker flag - no such linker flag exists.
* Checks CC and CXX are not a mix of GNU and non-GNU compilers.
* Added -Wall on gcc to show all warnings.
* Adds -g by default, but it can be removed by setting
  SAGE_DEBUG to something other than 'yes'

You might notice that gcc gives a lot of compiler warnings now I've added -Wall. It's a wonder the package works at all.

On 10.6, after building using the spkgs mentioned in the ticket, I have the following other doctest failures:

```

For instance, functions/other.py crashes Sage here:

`sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` crashes on the line `float(SR(RIF(Integer(2))))` with a similar message.  (I'm typing these on one computer while testing on another -- I'm not cut-and-pasting, so apologies for any typos.)

Setting SAGE64 to "yes" resulting in a build with the same doctest failures.  I don't know if setting SAGE64 to "yes" has any actual effect, but it does have cosmetic effects: first, when building a package like readline, without SAGE64, I get the message "Building a 32-bit version of Readline", but the resulting library is 64-bit.  Also, when SAGE64 is set, then compiler flags (for example when building bzip2) include "-m64".  I don't know if these are just cosmetic, or if they have a more serious effect.

On 10.5, using these spkgs, I get some failures with the 32-bit build, but these are known: see [this thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/954ecbadeb7676a8?tvc=2).

On 10.5, 64-bit build, all tests pass!

Here is John Palmieri's report from [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e47addca35db2f5f/55d70e14b5c25a0e):

```

In an attempt to save time, I attempted to build using all of these at
once (instead of doing one at a time), along with the new fortran spkg
(#6981) and the new r spkg (#6972).  On OS X 10.5, both 32-bit and 64-
bit, building was successful.  After applying the appropriate patches
-- the ones from 6883, 6919, 6972 -- 64-bit: all tests passed.  After
applying these patches to the 32-bit build, same failures as Minh
reported in another thread ("Sage 4.1.2.alpha2 doctest failures on OS
X 10.5.8").

In other words, the packages seem to all look good.  I have not
examined each one to see if the spkg-install files make sense, for
instance, but from the point of view of building and (apparently)
functioning on OS X 10.5, they work.

I don't have the energy to comment on each ticket individually, so
take this as my portion of a positive review for each ticket: on Mac
OS X 10.5, they build properly and seem to work.
```

Here is my report. I compiled Sage 4.1.2.alpha2 from scratch with the following packages:

* #6972 --- r-2.9.2.spkg
* #6981 --- fortran-20071120.p8.spkg
* #6974 --- libgpg_error-1.6.p2.spkg, gnutls-2.2.1.p3.spkg, python_gnutls-1.1.4.p6.spkg, libgcrypt-1.4.3.p2.spkg, opencdk-0.6.6.p1.spkg
* #6976 --- numpy-1.3.0.p2.spkg
* #6982 --- atlas-3.8.3.p8.spkg, linbox-1.1.6.p1.spkg
* #6969 --- boehm_gc-7.1.p2.spkg

* #7006 --- mpir-1.2.p6.spkg
* #6919 --- flint-1.5.0.p0.spkg
* #6990 --- python-2.6.2.p2.spkg
* #6951 --- singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.p0.spkg

The building machines are:

 which have been reported before to [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ff85e2965dc9e59b).
* eno on SkyNet: x86_64 Fedora 9 --- compile: yes; doctest pass: yes
* lena on SkyNet: x86_64 RHEL 5.3 --- compile: yes; doctest pass: yes
* menas on SkyNet: x86_64 openSUSE 11.1 --- compile: yes; doctest: yes

Positive review from me. Any doctest failures are to be fixed in upcoming rc release(s). At the moment, there are so many packages with porting work to Cygwin and OS X 10.6. I'm happy that those packages build OK on Cygwin and OS X 10.6.
