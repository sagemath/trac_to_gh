Attachment: **[trac_6993-revert_evalf.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6993/trac_6993-revert_evalf.patch.gz)**

This package includes corresponding changes for the tickets:

* #6948 powers of exp are over simplified
* #6902 log(x) is typeset as \ln x
* #6851 hashes for derivatives of symbolic functions still collide
* #6524 Ratio of two symbolic expressions involving derivative does not simplify
* #6992 rename lngamma to log gamma

The patch attached to this ticket is just an enhancement. It is the first step to cleaning up the interface for symbolic functions. Pynac now evaluates symbolic functions on non-exact input again. This eliminates the need for a separate `__call__` method in `sage.symbolic.function.PrimitiveFunction`.

There are a lot of other doctest failures caused by this package than the ones fixed above.  It is possible that some are spurious because I missed something in the tickets listed above, but I will post them here for now.

I think you should have been more explicit about how to test this - it wasn't clear that all the patches were necessary to avoid doctest issues.  I checked and I think they must all have been related to powers of exp.

Anyway, relevant tests pass, the "children" were easy to follow, so the only thing (possibly) hindering positive review is the parenthesis issue in #6948.

Positive review!  Great.  My only complaint is that Pynac is not on the Sage revision control system, so it's both difficult to look at (hence, thanks for the link to the changesets) and difficult to fix symbolic issues in Sage that really "should" live in Pynac.

To release manager: apply .p0 package first, then the tickets listed above in reverse numerical order, with #6948 ticket applying first the regular patch, then the print patch.  I think that should be the correct order, and should lead to no new doctest failures.
