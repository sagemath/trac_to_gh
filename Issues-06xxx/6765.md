Hello !!!

Following http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9d9b09274f1eab83/79938a2139ba25d9?lnk=gst&q=isr#79938a2139ba25d9 , here is the requested Tutorial page for Linear Programming.

To doctest it, you will need the spkg GLPK from #6867 and numerical.MIP from #6869

I hope you will like it !!! And thanks to Minh for helping me with Sphinx !

Nathann, you need to give commands on how to use the MIP capabilities of CBC. Where is `MIP()` defined? How do I import and use it? Please include those information in your patch.

Here's a conversion in IRC with Nathann:

```
05:00 < ncohen> mvngu: I do not understand the problem you have with MIP. It seems you copied some part of the examples into Sage
05:00 < ncohen> mvngu: and Sage answered it did not know where to find the class MIP
05:01 < ncohen> mvngu: even though I have added in sage/numerical/all.py a line : from MIP import *
05:01 < mvngu> ncohen: David Joyner replied to me in an email that it depends on #6502.
05:01 < mvngu> So I'll mark #6765 as depending on #6502.
05:02 < ncohen> ooooops
05:02 < ncohen> sorry ^^;
05:02 < mvngu> This means that #6502 must be merged first.
05:02 < ncohen> I've been working on this for some timme so sometimes I forget about it... ^^;
05:02 < ncohen> indeed
05:02 < ncohen> the thing is that I already posted something like 5 or 6 patches based upon #6502
05:02 < ncohen> LP is so useful for graphs !
05:03 < mvngu> Since GLPK is an optional spkg at the moment, so the doctests that depends on GLPK should be flagged as optional.
05:03 < mvngu> Do so with the flag "# optional" in doctests.
05:04 < mvngu> That way, when the test suite is run, anything with the flag "# optional" would be skipped over.
05:04 < mvngu> Unless you have the required optional spkg installed.
05:05 < ncohen> I see... :-/
05:05 < mvngu> And any doctests that depend on CBC must also be flagged as "# optional".
```
Also, this ticket depends on #6502.

As the functions dealing with LP have not been reviewed, I prefer to rewrite the MIP class for Sage to make it easier to use. I will post a new version of the MIP patch as soon as possible, along with all the patches for functions using it.

Sorry for the trouble, I'll try to make it quick !

Some comments: 

(1) When I run "sage -docbuild tutorial html", it complains

```
/Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/tutorial/tour_LP.rst:64: (WARNING/2) Title underline too short.

Variables in ``MixedIntegerLinearProgram``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
```
The string of double quotes should line up exactly with the previous line.  (Maybe it's good enough it is at least as long, but I think it should be the same length.)

(2) In a string like `minimized ( for example `2 x + y` )`, you shouldn't have a space after `(` or before `)`: it should say `minimized (for example `2 x + y`)`.  This happens throughout the document.  Along the same lines, there should be no space before "?" or before ":".  Before a block of examples (like lines 69-70), I think you want a visible colon, and you achieve that by having "::" with no preceding space.  (Using "::" with a preceding space signals a block of examples but doesn't print a colon at all.)

(3) On line 75, "remperature" should presumably be "temperature".  Try running a spell check.

(4) You don't have a period at the sentence ending the paragraph "What is a Mixed Integer Linear Program ?"  I haven't done any more careful proofreading, but you should check for other spelling, usage, and grammar errors.

(5) In multiline doctests, you need to change "....:" to "...".  As it stands, doctesting bombs on these lines.

(6) If I don't have GLPK or numerical.MIP installed, doctests have to pass anyway.  Also, if I don't have them, I absolutely don't want doctesting to try to install them, which the lines

```
     sage: # To install GLPK
     sage: install_package('glpk')
     sage: # To install Coin-OR Branch and Cut ( CBC )
     sage: install_package('cbc')
```
will do.  Maybe mark those lines as "# not tested"?
