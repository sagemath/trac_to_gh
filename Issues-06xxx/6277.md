<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Just for the record, 
`sage -tp a.py a.py`
results in 

```
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'devel/sage/sage/rings/arith.py'
```
so I'm fixing the title of the ticket.  

I also consider this invalid.  There are good reasons to want to test the same file a bunch of times, e.g.,

```
sage -tp 10 a.py a.py  a.py a.py a.py a.py a.py a.py a.py a.py a.py
```
would be very useful when tracking down errors that only happen with some probability.
