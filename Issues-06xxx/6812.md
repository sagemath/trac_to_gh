Refactoring :

-> I implemented a new class InfiniteEnumeratedSet (with category)

There is no a shortcut in sage to IntegerVectorsUptoPermGroup which is a user friendly parent (with hope).
This code stay really strongly connected to the Invariant theory and connected with a the graded algebras of multivariate polynomial view as combination of orbit sum. This really why the code enter this new folder : sage/combinat/invariant_ring_perm_gps (other things have to come here....)

Hi!

This is not a review yet, just some remarks.

Indeed it seems to me that the comments and the documentation should be proof read by a native speaker. I am not a native speaker, I'm afraid.

I also suggest to rename some methods. For example, the purpose of "generate_list_of_sum" is not clear from that name:

* "generate" suggests a process. Therefore, I expected that the method would return an iterator. But in fact, an actual list is returned. A similar statement applies to "get_orbit". Why not simply "orbit"?
* "list_of_sums" is not clear at all. I mean, there is the notion of "partition", so, there is no reason to describe it as "list of sums". Of course, not all partitions are returned, but representatives for each permutation class of partitions.

So, I think "partition_class_representatives" or slightly less precise "partition_classes" would be clearer.

And "generate_canonicals": The return value is the list of canonical representatives of all children of the input. So, why not "children_representatives" or "canonical_children"?

Best regards, Simon

This looks very interesting, and I could definitely use it in my research (instead of looping over *all* integer vectors).  A few comments:

The syntax seems rather different than `IntegerVectors`, though; for instance, to access these vectors with a given sum one has to use a fairly awkward notation, instead of something analogous to `IntegerVectors(5,6)` for those sum 5, length 6.  Is it possible to streamline that?  

Also, there is fairly non-idiomatic English in some of the docstrings.  

Finally, you should put your normal name in the "Author" field, instead of your Trac username, since the script which generates contributor lists uses this information directly.

I am sorry that I am not familiar enough with the category framework to properly review this properly, though :(

Thanks for your remarks,

I am going to open right now a vote for a better name and access to these class of parents on sage-combinat-devel (and you in CC to vote too). 

Feel free to point language mistakes to me! I have to improve my English. Use classical e-mail if you don't want to charge the trac.

Thanks very much, the code will be as much better as it will be used.

For this last upload : 

* Cythonize the is_canonical test
* Change syntax to have IntegerVectorsModPermgroup(G, sum=n) like IntegerVectors or other
* Add a very heavy collection of tests in documentation for developers in the cython part

I feel that my code is not very well polished, but I need advises, corrections and comments. Especially, I hope my English is not too much horrible. Flyspell is well configured on my emacs to american but I don't always use the right words. Sorry for that.

Other things, I know the importance to have good tests in the code. But here, as the method `strong_generating_system` is very slow, test the module on any group take a very long time (around 3 seconds per group).

That should raise an error - I feel like we just had something like this somewhere else, but I can't remember where.  Also, you should put an example of how to get elements of the infinite class in the main class, since people may not ever read the documentation for something other than `IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup`, which is the one intended to be used by people, right?  (It's the only one imported into the global namespace, at any rate.)

<div id="comment:22" align="right">Comment 22</div>

Any reason why you don't just use the tests but with this?

```
sage: long_test() # long time
```
It's too much work to remove all the #s anyway if one wanted to try them out.

I like the splitting things into pyx and not.  Also, any reason not to incorporate the pyx file into the documentation?  

You might want to add a couple examples to the cdef'd functions.  I realize this isn't required, but why not? :) 

What happens when you `list()` one of the infinite classes?  That should raise an error - I feel like we just had something like this somewhere else, but I can't remember where.  Also, you should put an example of how to get elements of the infinite class in the main class, since people may not ever read the documentation for something other than `IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup`, which is the one intended to be used by people, right?  (It's the only one imported into the global namespace, at any rate.)  For this one, I put 'needs work'.

Finally, you are right about the English; there are a few places where I'm not quite sure what is intended, even.  But that can be fixed.  Keep it up - this will be great!  (And very useful for me once I figure out how to use it correctly in my situation.)

<div id="comment:23" align="right">Comment 23</div>

Thanks a lot for having regarded this...

For # long time, I do not know. I think I will select a subpart of the tests and include them with long time. The developer guide say : "These will not be run regularly during Sage development, but will get run before major releases. No example should take more than about 30 seconds.". Currently, on my three years old macbook, all tests take something like 6 minutes. Especially, there are also # optional - gap_database tests here. I will select some groups and add some tests with long time.

I didn't know we can add pyx file in the doctree, I will add it. I will also add comments on the fact that the is_canonical test is polymorph. I just checked the only thing required is a comparison test:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup import is_canonical
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4,5,6)]])
sage: sgs = [map(lambda x: Permutation(x), trans) for trans in G.strong_generating_system()]
sage: is_canonical(sgs, ['c','b','a','b','b','a'])
True
sage: is_canonical(sgs, [3,2,1,2,2,1])
True
```
As string can be compared with `<` and `>`, the function can be also used on such object.

I think that examples in cdef functions aren't required just because one cannot import them in the sage console. Try from file.pyx import <tab>. There is perhaps another way to import them, but I don't know...

For the behavior of list(), I think it is ok. The category framework do the job:

```
sage: I = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]]))
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = IntegerRange(1,+Infinity, 5)
sage: I
{1, 6, ..}
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: I
An example of an infinite enumerated set: the non negative integers
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
```

I going to improve the doc of IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup. You're definitely right and I think it deserves to stay the only entrance point for this module.

Thanks for your comments.

But some patches (before me in the queue) and supposed to have the status "Needs review" on the trac make this patch can be apply (typically, file like '\modules_list' or '\doc\bla\foo' are concerned). As It was late in the night and I was tired, realize It doesn't work make me a little angry. Sorry for that.

I will finalize it on a separate branch as much of Sage contributors usually do.

Dima visited me last week in Orsay and he is also interested by the enumeration of integer vectors over 0 and 1 modulo the action of a permutation group. I already fixed all the details, just a (possible) rebase and some doctests should be fine before reuplaoding it.

No, I can't. I was searching for "Borie", and all I got was

Searching for "integer vectors modulo permgroup" (the commit message of the patch) didn't help either.

Replying to [@sagetrac-nborie](#comment%3A56):
> I will propose a new version this week end and the possible ameliorations will be part of separate tickets. The use of Clonable integer array is ok and fine because all is in Sage.

Great! And will the Cython stuff we discussed in Paris also be part of that patch?

For the record: I finally re-implemented my algorithm for the computation of fundamental invariants of non-modular invariant rings of finite groups for the special case of permutation groups, using your implementation of orbits. I should have done that earlier. After all, thanks to your work on enumerating orbits, it will probably be a lot faster than my original implementation in Singular (which dealt very inefficiently with orbits).

<div id="comment:58" align="right">Comment 58</div>

Ok, here is a last version :

- Including categories of quotient of set and (In)finite enumerated set
- Using the cython data structure based on C array
- Tests of coherences with others features from combinat (Partition, monomials, graphs)
- Handling of 0-1 enumeration (like adjacent matrix of graph)

On this last Patch, all tests pass with --long and --optional for the two new files. I didn't run all tests of Sage but this new feature is orthogonal with other part of Sage. The docbuild produce no warning and the doc looks clean.

To present one other test, here is the way to build all unlabeled graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)
sage: G.cardinality() == factorial(7)
True
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
```
This module, not optimized for the graphs do that in less than 1 minutes on my 4 years old macbook. As improvement for the future, the code is trivially "parallelizable". But this parallelization should be done on SearchForest and not on this module.

For the reviewer, please be careful with my English. I still try to correct myself as much but I am sure some sentences are not full-sense and there are probably some mistakes that flyspell (and me) didn't catch.

Some more comments:

There should not only be a fast `ClonableIntArray.list()`, but also a fast
`ClonableIntArray.tuple()`: Sometimes, one needs a tuple, not a list, and it
would be awkward and slow to first transfrom the clonable int array into a list
and transform that into a tuple.

I think that could be done here, or do you prefer a different ticket?

You know that my application of your work would be: Compute non-modular
invariant rings of permutation groups. For that purpose, it would be good if
clonable int arrays could be used to define exponent vectors of a monomial. But
that should clearly be on a different ticket.

What still needs review here?  Any English help still needed?

A couple points on the built doc:
* Some inconsistency in formatting, e.g. 

```
If sum is an integer, it returns a finite enumerated set containing all integer vectors maximum in their orbit for the lexicographic order and whose entries sum to `sum`.
```
  should pick `sum` or sum, preferably `sum`, I guess?
* Similarly, sometimes there are no links, as in 

```
To get the orbit of any integer vector  under the action of the group, use the method orbit:
```
  but others are indeed hyperlinked.  Might as well get it all done for ease of browsing.
* `last corner case :` should be `last corner case:`
* There are lots of missing periods at ends of sentences.  That is, at the ends of sentences which are not ended by colons, which is fine.

Replying to [@kcrisman](#comment%3A67):
> What still needs review here?  Any English help still needed?

Sorry, I really should have focused on reviewing. Instead, I tried to use the patch in order to provide a better implementation of my algorithm on computing fundamental invariants of non-modular representations of finite groups, in the case of permutation groups.

Yes, the patch basically works (as confirmed by the patch bot). However, I will do some checks: My impression is that the combinat people tend to keep the most recent patch versions in the combinat queue, rather than posting them on trac.

Anyway, the plan is that I provide a reviewer patch. But since I am no native speaker either, some additional help with English is certainly appreciated.

When I see

```
            for child in children:
                if child not in new_to_analyse:
                    new_to_analyse.append(child)
```
in the cpdef function "orbit" in sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup.pyx, it seems to me that new_to_analyse should rather be a set, not a list, since the containment test "child not in new_to_analyse" works a *lot* faster on (long) sets than lists.

Create a relatively large set of random ints, and get the corresponding list (unsorted, apparently):

```
sage: S = set(randint(1,20000) for _ in range(5000))
sage: L = list(S)
sage: L[:10]
[16384, 5019, 16203, 8195, 16388, 8197, 16391, 600, 16394, 8204]
```
Now, define one function operating on lists and another operating on sets that add the integers from 0 to 10000 to the list or set - but only if it isn't in the list/set yet.

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test1(list L):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         if i not in L:
....:             L.append(i)
....: def test2(set S):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         S.add(i)
....: """)
sage: len(L)
4426
sage: %time test1(L)
CPU times: user 2.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.12 s
Wall time: 2.12 s
sage: len(L)
12240
```
The operation on the set is so much faster that I'm measuring it with timeit, also taking the time to copy the set (so that the length is preserved when running the loop for the timing):

```
sage: len(S)
4426
sage: %timeit test2(copy(S))
625 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ms per loop
sage: len(S)
4426
```

Hence, the same operation (at least in my proof-of-concept) is roughly 2000 times faster on sets than on lists.

The disadvantage is that the output of orbit() would be in a random order, so that to the very least it has to be sorted in the doc tests. Do you want that the output of orbit() is a sorted list (which would of course be easy to implement)?

Thanks so much for your comments!!!

I didn't know Cython have a set data structure and YES, deleting the doubles at each step is the right way to take care of automorphism group of the vector, I must have used set!

You already explain to me at Orsay for the getitem with ClonableIntArray, it is an another mistake from me to not having updated the old code with that.

I worked a lot on the algorithmic but I am a poor python/cython programmer. All your detailed comments make me understand what need to be done to produce an efficient code, thanks very much for this didactical approach.

From my point of view, orbit() should return a set and not a list (mathematically and computationally speaking). Sorting it deserve to be only the choice of the user.

I prepare for you some interesting benchmarks. Most of them consists in generating all canonical vectors under staircase for cyclic groups, symmetric groups and some transitive groups if you have installed the optional packages database_gap.

<div id="comment:77" align="right">Comment 77</div>

I just added two files providing a good k-test (especially for invariant theory):

The function to use is: TEST_generation_orbit_sum
The function is in the file: benchmarks_generating_orbit_sum.py

The good tests to run are the following (depending the size you want to test):
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(8,1), verbose=True) (~2 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(9,1), verbose=True) (~20 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(10,1), verbose=True) (~3 min)

All the complexity are contained in such examples.

For graphs lovers and the change from list to set, you should use a test including vector with large automorphism group like :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(15,28)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: timeit('S._cardinality_from_iterator()')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.3 s per loop
```
This test build the 156 graphs over 6 vertices enumerated up to an isomorphism. And vectors whose entries are 0 or 1 have 'often' large automorphism group.

Comparing the old implementation with Python list (and 2 years of development of Sage), the module is currently 3 or 4 times faster.

OK. What I had a few minutes ago was: Compute with sets internally and return an ordered list. But if you agree that a set is nicer then I can change it (means: Change the doc tests and the specification of the output).

There are two problems with the orbit() method:

```
        assert isinstance(v, (list, ClonableIntArray)), '%s shoud be a Python list or an element of %s'%(v, self)
        try:
            if v.parent() is self:
                return orbit(self._sgs, v)
        except:
            return orbit(self._sgs, self.element_class(self, v, check=False))
```
That means that *None* is returned if v happens to be a ClonableIntArray with a different parent. Shouldn't v be transformed into an element of `self` instead?

And is it really a good idea to convert v into an element of `self` without checking?

Yes, this piece of code is horribly ugly... The point is that the orbit method will work with any integer vector. v doesn't need to be canonical. I don't have a use case but I was thinking it would be more convenient to allow the user to use this method for any integer vector (canonical or not). 

After for safety, I don't know the consequence of such a choice on the lung run.

Anyway, the test is_canonical should be very very much faster than the full expansion of an orbit and a user who want just an orbit can also compute his own function.

Agreed. So, check=False should be fine.

But I do think that the orbit method should try to convert the input vector from a different parent into self, and should certainly not return "None".

Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.

By the way, I made some further tweaks and am now down to

> Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.

And more than that, there is a king of gardener lemma inside the is_canonical method, the partial_lex comparison cut some branches of the orbit just by reading the first entries.

I also think the change from list to set produce more than x2 speedup, it is probably an exponential optimization, you should try before and after with graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: time S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
Time: CPU 128.64 s, Wall: 136.10 s
```
It become to be a large test for this last one. (1044 symmetric matrices of size 7)

A student of Florent Hivert had to master project to parallelize SearchForest. Imagine what such module can need by inheritance... (with possible adaptations according changes of SearchForest)

I hesitate to directly give it a positive review, since I somehow think that my patch is not just a reviewer patch (in spite of its name), because it changes the code non-trivially. So, please have a closer look on it!
