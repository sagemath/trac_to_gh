Refactoring : 
-> I move the code in sage/combinat/invariant_ring_perm_gps (advise form Nicolas Thiéry)
-> I implemented a new class InfiniteEnumeratedSet (with category)

There is no a shortcut in sage to IntegerVectorsUptoPermGroup which is a user friendly parent (with hope).
This code stay really strongly connected to the Invariant theory and connected with a the graded algebras of multivariate polynomial view as combination of orbit sum. This really why the code enter this new folder : sage/combinat/invariant_ring_perm_gps (other things have to come here....)

Hi!

This is not a review yet, just some remarks.

Indeed it seems to me that the comments and the documentation should be proof read by a native speaker. I am not a native speaker, I'm afraid.

I also suggest to rename some methods. For example, the purpose of "generate_list_of_sum" is not clear from that name:

* "generate" suggests a process. Therefore, I expected that the method would return an iterator. But in fact, an actual list is returned. A similar statement applies to "get_orbit". Why not simply "orbit"?
* "list_of_sums" is not clear at all. I mean, there is the notion of "partition", so, there is no reason to describe it as "list of sums". Of course, not all partitions are returned, but representatives for each permutation class of partitions.

So, I think "partition_class_representatives" or slightly less precise "partition_classes" would be clearer.

And "generate_canonicals": The return value is the list of canonical representatives of all children of the input. So, why not "children_representatives" or "canonical_children"?

Best regards, Simon

Thanks for your remarks,

I am going to open right now a vote for a better name and access to these class of parents on sage-combinat-devel (and you in CC to vote too). 

Feel free to point language mistakes to me! I have to improve my English. Use classical e-mail if you don't want to charge the trac.

Thanks very much, the code will be as much better as it will be used.

For this last upload : 

* Cythonize the is_canonical test
* Change syntax to have IntegerVectorsModPermgroup(G, sum=n) like IntegerVectors or other
* Add a very heavy collection of tests in documentation for developers in the cython part

I feel that my code is not very well polished, but I need advises, corrections and comments. Especially, I hope my English is not too much horrible. Flyspell is well configured on my emacs to american but I don't always use the right words. Sorry for that.

Other things, I know the importance to have good tests in the code. But here, as the method `strong_generating_system` is very slow, test the module on any group take a very long time (around 3 seconds per group). I will be happy to get some advise and opinion on what deserve to be launch in doctest, what deserve to be kept in comment inside the code and what deserve to be trashed. Currently, the patch present a lot of tests in comments inside the code. It is perhaps too much (or the tests are not the goods one).

It's too much work to remove all the #s anyway if one wanted to try them out.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:23'></a>\nThanks a lot for having regarded this...\n\nFor # long time, I do not know. I think I will select a subpart of the tests and include them with long time. The developer guide say : \"These will not be run regularly during Sage development, but will get run before major releases. No example should take more than about 30 seconds.\". Currently, on my three years old macbook, all tests take something like 6 minutes. Especially, there are also # optional - gap_database tests here. I will select some groups and add some tests with long time.\n\nI didn't know we can add pyx file in the doctree, I will add it. I will also add comments on the fact that the is_canonical test is polymorph. I just checked the only thing required is a comparison test:\n\n```\nsage: from sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup import is_canonical\nsage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4,5,6)]])\nsage: sgs = [map(lambda x: Permutation(x), trans) for trans in G.strong_generating_system()]\nsage: is_canonical(sgs, ['c','b','a','b','b','a'])\nTrue\nsage: is_canonical(sgs, [3,2,1,2,2,1])\nTrue\n```\nAs string can be compared with `<` and `>`, the function can be also used on such object.\n\nI think that examples in cdef functions aren't required just because one cannot import them in the sage console. Try from file.pyx import <tab>. There is perhaps another way to import them, but I don't know...\n\nFor the behavior of list(), I think it is ok. The category framework do the job:\n\n```\nsage: I = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]]))\nsage: list(I)\n...\nNotImplementedError: infinite list\nsage: I = IntegerRange(1,+Infinity, 5)\nsage: I\n{1, 6, ..}\nsage: list(I)\n...\nNotImplementedError: infinite list\nsage: I = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()\nsage: I\nAn example of an infinite enumerated set: the non negative integers\nsage: list(I)\n...\nNotImplementedError: infinite list\n```\n\nI going to improve the doc of IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup. You're definitely right and I think it deserves to stay the only entrance point for this module.\n\nThanks for your comments.",

Thanks a lot for having regarded this...

For # long time, I do not know. I think I will select a subpart of the tests and include them with long time. The developer guide say : "These will not be run regularly during Sage development, but will get run before major releases. No example should take more than about 30 seconds.". Currently, on my three years old macbook, all tests take something like 6 minutes. Especially, there are also # optional - gap_database tests here. I will select some groups and add some tests with long time.

I didn't know we can add pyx file in the doctree, I will add it. I will also add comments on the fact that the is_canonical test is polymorph. I just checked the only thing required is a comparison test:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup import is_canonical
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4,5,6)]])
sage: sgs = [map(lambda x: Permutation(x), trans) for trans in G.strong_generating_system()]
sage: is_canonical(sgs, ['c','b','a','b','b','a'])
True
sage: is_canonical(sgs, [3,2,1,2,2,1])
True
```
As string can be compared with `<` and `>`, the function can be also used on such object.

I think that examples in cdef functions aren't required just because one cannot import them in the sage console. Try from file.pyx import <tab>. There is perhaps another way to import them, but I don't know...

For the behavior of list(), I think it is ok. The category framework do the job:

```
sage: I = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4)]]))
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = IntegerRange(1,+Infinity, 5)
sage: I
{1, 6, ..}
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
sage: I = InfiniteEnumeratedSets().example()
sage: I
An example of an infinite enumerated set: the non negative integers
sage: list(I)
...
NotImplementedError: infinite list
```

I going to improve the doc of IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup. You're definitely right and I think it deserves to stay the only entrance point for this module.

Thanks for your comments.

That means, including our discussion of last November, I guess.

Could you remind me how I can obtain the current version of the patch?

Unfortunetly, I can update the last version...

I need to download the 5.0, update the combinat queue and probably rebase my patch...

Possibly, you can have access to it browsing the sources at : http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/ 

However, I don't know if this latest version can be applied on any version of Sage.

Dima visited me last week in Orsay and he is also interested by the enumeration of integer vectors over 0 and 1 modulo the action of a permutation group. I already fixed all the details, just a (possible) rebase and some doctests should be fine before reuplaoding it.

At least the patch from here smoothly applies to sage-5.0. And since there are only few changes to existing files, I don't think there will be conflicts.

> Possibly, you can have access to it browsing the sources at : http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/ 


No, I can't. I was searching for "Borie", and all I got was

```

```

Searching for "integer vectors modulo permgroup" (the commit message of the patch) didn't help either.

So, please provide an exact reference.

I don't know if the links will work on your computer. Once you will have this page, click on 'raw', it downloaded the patch from the repository when I tested just 1 minute ago.

I am sorry but I really don't manage the use of this mercurial web interface for repository. And as I said before, I will try to do something in the two days to come..

Currently, I just finish to build Sage and the patch doesn't need rebase for 5.0, I apply and Sage started with errors. This patch currently depends on : refactor_integer_vectors_clonableintarray-nb.patch #-4_7_2 # very experimental
which is just before in the combinat-queue. I will make the patch for 6812 independent shortly.

Ok, here is a last version :

- Including categories of quotient of set and (In)finite enumerated set
- Using the cython data structure based on C array
- Tests of coherences with others features from combinat (Partition, monomials, graphs)
- Handling of 0-1 enumeration (like adjacent matrix of graph)

On this last Patch, all tests pass with --long and --optional for the two new files. I didn't run all tests of Sage but this new feature is orthogonal with other part of Sage. The docbuild produce no warning and the doc looks clean.

To present one other test, here is the way to build all unlabeled graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)
sage: G.cardinality() == factorial(7)
True
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
```
This module, not optimized for the graphs do that in less than 1 minutes on my 4 years old macbook. As improvement for the future, the code is trivially "parallelizable". But this parallelization should be done on SearchForest and not on this module.

For the reviewer, please be careful with my English. I still try to correct myself as much but I am sure some sentences are not full-sense and there are probably some mistakes that flyspell (and me) didn't catch.

Thanks for this comment and for the further to come. There are probably much more things to improve in the current code. I hope the current patch can allow you to play with invariants of permutation groups. However, I won't touch this patch anymore until one or two weeks. I am sorry but I need to prepare important dates for my future. I have an audition Tuesday for an associate professor position in the Faugère'team PolSys and I must focus my work around the preparation of such appointments.

Anyway, I will read all this page once I could come back to this stuff. Feel free to give some comments and commands around this module to improve the code.

the algorithmic details are explain in French in (with some Benchmarks):

It is from page 39 to 51. It is in French but pictures should make things easy to understand.

Some more comments:

There should not only be a fast `ClonableIntArray.list()`, but also a fast
`ClonableIntArray.tuple()`: Sometimes, one needs a tuple, not a list, and it
would be awkward and slow to first transfrom the clonable int array into a list
and transform that into a tuple.

I think that could be done here, or do you prefer a different ticket?

You know that my application of your work would be: Compute non-modular
invariant rings of permutation groups. For that purpose, it would be good if
clonable int arrays could be used to define exponent vectors of a monomial. But
that should clearly be on a different ticket.

What still needs review here?  Any English help still needed?

A couple points on the built doc:
* Some inconsistency in formatting, e.g. 

```
If sum is an integer, it returns a finite enumerated set containing all integer vectors maximum in their orbit for the lexicographic order and whose entries sum to `sum`.
```
  should pick `sum` or sum, preferably `sum`, I guess?
* Similarly, sometimes there are no links, as in 

```
To get the orbit of any integer vector  under the action of the group, use the method orbit:
```
  but others are indeed hyperlinked.  Might as well get it all done for ease of browsing.
* `last corner case :` should be `last corner case:`
* There are lots of missing periods at ends of sentences.  That is, at the ends of sentences which are not ended by colons, which is fine.

When I see

```
            for child in children:
                if child not in new_to_analyse:
                    new_to_analyse.append(child)
```
in the cpdef function "orbit" in sage.combinat.enumeration_mod_permgroup.pyx, it seems to me that new_to_analyse should rather be a set, not a list, since the containment test "child not in new_to_analyse" works a *lot* faster on (long) sets than lists.

Create a relatively large set of random ints, and get the corresponding list (unsorted, apparently):

```
sage: S = set(randint(1,20000) for _ in range(5000))
sage: L = list(S)
sage: L[:10]
[16384, 5019, 16203, 8195, 16388, 8197, 16391, 600, 16394, 8204]
```
Now, define one function operating on lists and another operating on sets that add the integers from 0 to 10000 to the list or set - but only if it isn't in the list/set yet.

```
sage: cython("""
....: def test1(list L):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         if i not in L:
....:             L.append(i)
....: def test2(set S):
....:     cdef int i
....:     for i in range(10000):
....:         S.add(i)
....: """)
sage: len(L)
4426
sage: %time test1(L)
CPU times: user 2.11 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 2.12 s
Wall time: 2.12 s
sage: len(L)
12240
```
The operation on the set is so much faster that I'm measuring it with timeit, also taking the time to copy the set (so that the length is preserved when running the loop for the timing):

```
sage: len(S)
4426
sage: %timeit test2(copy(S))
625 loops, best of 3: 1.12 ms per loop
sage: len(S)
4426
```

Hence, the same operation (at least in my proof-of-concept) is roughly 2000 times faster on sets than on lists.

The disadvantage is that the output of orbit() would be in a random order, so that to the very least it has to be sorted in the doc tests. Do you want that the output of orbit() is a sorted list (which would of course be easy to implement)?

I just added two files providing a good k-test (especially for invariant theory):

The function to use is: TEST_generation_orbit_sum
The function is in the file: benchmarks_generating_orbit_sum.py

The good tests to run are the following (depending the size you want to test):
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(8,1), verbose=True) (~2 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(9,1), verbose=True) (~20 sec)
* TEST_generation_orbit_sum(TransitiveGroup(10,1), verbose=True) (~3 min)

All the complexity are contained in such examples.

For graphs lovers and the change from list to set, you should use a test including vector with large automorphism group like :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(15,28)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: timeit('S._cardinality_from_iterator()')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.3 s per loop
```
This test build the 156 graphs over 6 vertices enumerated up to an isomorphism. And vectors whose entries are 0 or 1 have 'often' large automorphism group.

Comparing the old implementation with Python list (and 2 years of development of Sage), the module is currently 3 or 4 times faster.

OK. What I had a few minutes ago was: Compute with sets internally and return an ordered list. But if you agree that a set is nicer then I can change it (means: Change the doc tests and the specification of the output).

There are two problems with the orbit() method:

```
        assert isinstance(v, (list, ClonableIntArray)), '%s shoud be a Python list or an element of %s'%(v, self)
        try:
            if v.parent() is self:
                return orbit(self._sgs, v)
        except:
            return orbit(self._sgs, self.element_class(self, v, check=False))
```
That means that *None* is returned if v happens to be a ClonableIntArray with a different parent. Shouldn't v be transformed into an element of `self` instead?

And is it really a good idea to convert v into an element of `self` without checking?

Yes, this piece of code is horribly ugly... The point is that the orbit method will work with any integer vector. v doesn't need to be canonical. I don't have a use case but I was thinking it would be more convenient to allow the user to use this method for any integer vector (canonical or not). 

After for safety, I don't know the consequence of such a choice on the lung run.

Anyway, the test is_canonical should be very very much faster than the full expansion of an orbit and a user who want just an orbit can also compute his own function.

Agreed. So, check=False should be fine.

But I do think that the orbit method should try to convert the input vector from a different parent into self, and should certainly not return "None".

> Anyway, the test is_canonical should be very very much faster than the full expansion of an orbit


Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.

By the way, I made some further tweaks and am now down to

Yes! None is not an option here. It must return a set or raise an error.

> Of course. The algorithm for is_canonical looks almost the same as the full expansion of an orbit, but if it is in fact non-canonical then the function will return "False" before finishing the computation of the whole orbit.


And more than that, there is a king of gardener lemma inside the is_canonical method, the partial_lex comparison cut some branches of the orbit just by reading the first entries.

I also think the change from list to set produce more than x2 speedup, it is probably an exponential optimization, you should try before and after with graphs over 7 vertices :

```
sage: G = TransitiveGroup(21,38)          
sage: S = IntegerVectorsModPermutationGroup(G, max_part=1)
sage: time S._cardinality_from_iterator()
1044
Time: CPU 128.64 s, Wall: 136.10 s
```
It become to be a large test for this last one. (1044 symmetric matrices of size 7)

A student of Florent Hivert had to master project to parallelize SearchForest. Imagine what such module can need by inheritance... (with possible adaptations according changes of SearchForest)

I was just double checking everything... You really done a lot of work finally, really much as I expected. My first patch was not so much ready.

As you posted another reviewer patch, once I will test everything, I will perhaps merge the 3 patches into a final one for the release manager.

I am completely agree with all corrections and improvements provided by the two reviewer patches from Simon. I just merge them into my first proposition.

The current implementation pass all my corner cases around invariant theory. All tests pass, the documentation seems good to me and the code looks ready to go. I give the patch a positive review.

This is a three years old wanted improvement (beginning of my PhD thesis) and Sage changed so much these last three years.... Thanks you Simon for the hours you spent on finalizing this and thanks you Karl for English suggestions/corrections (especially those sent by mail 6 month ago...)
