When using the MATLAB interface in Sage MATLAB crashes on startup. This is due to library conflicts with Sage.

I have created a (minor) patch to use sage-native-execute when starting MATLAB. This fixes the problems on my machine (OS X 10.6) and the interface now passes all doctests.

I can't test the exact setup, but in all cases using sage-native-execute is a good idea, and this does work on Linux, so positive review.
