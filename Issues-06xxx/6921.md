When using the MATLAB interface in Sage MATLAB crashes on startup. This is due to library conflicts with Sage.

I have created a (minor) patch to use sage-native-execute when starting MATLAB. This fixes the problems on my machine (OS X 10.6) and the interface now passes all doctests.

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
