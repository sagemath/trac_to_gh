This patch implements kittens, hexads and mathematical blackjack as explained in

```

It is used in a book on coding theory I'm writing with Jon-Lark Kim on coding theory, which uses Sage throughout to illustrate error-correcting codes.

These patches add the examples suggested by the referee.

One odd thing is that it appears that a list of elements containing infinity is sorted differently on an intel mac than on an ubuntu machine.
Because of this, I had to add a # random comment to a docstring.
