This patch implements kittens, hexads and mathematical blackjack as explained in

```
    R. Curtis, ``The Steiner system $S(5,6,12)$, the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, 
    and the kitten,'' in {\bf Computational group theory}, ed. M. Atkinson, 
    Academic Press, 1984.
    J. Conway, ``Hexacode and tetracode - MINIMOG and MOG,'' in {\bf Computational 
    group theory}, ed. M. Atkinson, Academic Press, 1984.

    http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_8/Abstracts/v8i2r11.html
```

It is used in a book on coding theory I'm writing with Jon-Lark Kim on coding theory, which uses Sage throughout to illustrate error-correcting codes.

These patches add the examples suggested by the referee.

One odd thing is that it appears that a list of elements containing infinity is sorted differently on an intel mac than on an ubuntu machine.
Because of this, I had to add a # random comment to a docstring.
