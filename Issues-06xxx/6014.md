It is used in a book on coding theory I'm writing with Jon-Lark Kim on coding theory, which uses Sage throughout to illustrate error-correcting codes.

This implements the referee's suggestions, passes sage -testall on 4.0.1.a0 on a 64bit ubuntu 9.04 machine(except for the problem with html.py, which was already reported as a separate issue). Also, sage -docbuild reference html worked without errors.

Both patches need to be applied.

These patches add the examples suggested by the referee.

One odd thing is that it appears that a list of elements containing infinity is sorted differently on an intel mac than on an ubuntu machine.
Because of this, I had to add a # random comment to a docstring.
