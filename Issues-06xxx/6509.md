Tested this with a lot of values taken from:
[http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A006431](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A006431)

and usage of:

[http://www.alpertron.com.ar/FSQUARES.HTM](http://www.alpertron.com.ar/FSQUARES.HTM)

When we look at [http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A002635](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A002635)
we see that for instance 82 can be written in 7 ways as the sum of
4 squares. For more results see:
[http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/b002635.txt](http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/b002635.txt)

So indeed this can be improved. But for now this is ok for a first attempt.
Positive review.
