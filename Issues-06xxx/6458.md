These doctests don't actually assert that the results are correct.  Could you add the few lines verifying that you're really getting a basis and really getting an inverse?

Also, I get a doctest failure on sage.math.  This could be transient -- this is with a slightly out of date sage build.  But there's no way this will work on all architectures, so testing the property will be much better.
