This patches extend the sage.combinat.backtrack library with other
generic tools for constructing large sets whose elements can be
enumerated by exploring a search space with a (lazy) tree or graph
structure.

- SearchForest:
  Depth first search through a tree descrived by a `child` function
- GenericBacktracker: (was readilly there)
  Depth first search through a tree descrived by a `child` function, with branch pruning, ...
- TransitiveIdeal:
  Depth first search through a graph described by a `neighbours` relation
- TransitiveIdealGraded:
  Breath first search through a graph described by a `neighbours` relation

Todo: the names are crappy and inconsistent, because they come from
different point of views. We need to find a good naming scheme!!! 

Do we want to emphasize the underlying graph/tree structure?  The
branch&bound aspect? The transitive closure of a relation point of
view?

Todo: which interface do we want:
- TransitiveIdeal(relation, generators)
- TransitiveIdeal(generators, relation)
The code needs to be standardized once the choice is done.

Passes tests:   ./sage -t devel/sage-backtrack/sage/combinat/

Reviewer patch adds two doctests, and some general cleanup, so apply on top of the main patch.

In the case of a search tree (not a graph), options for "leaves only" would be useful.  Then the generators could be checked for a first element when using a search tree for existence questions.

Building a single function to call these routines as variants might ease the question of names and interfaces.

Positive review.
