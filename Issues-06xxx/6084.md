<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
I eventually found this ticket after a bug hunt related to #9457.  That patch changes power series comparison to use `padded_list` instead of `list`; I noticed that this patch (6084_ALL.patch) also makes changes to power series comparison, so maybe it makes sense to incorporate #9457 into this patch?

I think to get this reviewed, some additional organization will be useful -- here's what I would suggest:

* Give us an introductory description of what this patch accomplishes: What are the "many different ways of handling precision"?  Why was this needed?  What had to be done?  What are the main ideas of your implementation?

* Presumably the patch has been broken into some conceptual pieces -- it would be useful if you could explain what these are, so that they can be reviewed somewhat independently if possible.

* I would suggest versioning each separate patch piece (since they will surely need to be updated), so a naming scheme like `6084_1.n.patch`.

* An always-up-to-date `6084_ALL.patch` will make for easy downloading and applying (but viewing the separate pieces on trac is very useful for me)

* Any other ways you can think to break the review down into distinct pieces will be much appreciated

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>\nI will build a copy of 4.7.1.alpha2 overnight and port the patches to there.\n\nThe key idea of this patch is that a polynomial over Zp should not be stored as a list of coefficients, but instead as an element of ZZ[x], together with some sort of precision object that records the precision to which each coefficient is known.  There are two main benefits of this approach:\n1. One can use fast algorithms for things like polynomial multiplication, rather than being forced back on naive multiplication due to a desire to preserve precision.  For example, Karatsuba multiplication uses the identity\n\n(f<sub>0</sub> + x<sup>n</sup> f<sub>1</sub>) (g<sub>0</sub> + x<sup>n</sup> g<sub>1</sub>) = (f<sub>0</sub> g<sub>0</sub>) + (f<sub>1</sub> g<sub>1</sub>) x<sup>2n</sup> + ((f<sub>0</sub> + f<sub>1</sub>)(g<sub>0</sub> + g<sub>1</sub>) - f<sub>0</sub> g<sub>0</sub> - f<sub>1</sub> g<sub>1</sub>)x<sup>n</sup>\n\nThis can lose precision over the naive definition since there are more additions than needed.  But if one computes an approximation over ZZ and then determines precision separately, one can use Karatsuba or FFT algorithms at will.\n1. If one wants to use different methods for tracking precision (see below), the separation makes the implementation more modular and thus easier to implement and maintain.\n\nThese patches implement two kinds of polynomials: an anchored polynomial type which stores an approximation (in ZZ[x] for example) and a precision object, and a floating polynomial type which stores a common power of p for all the coefficients together with an anchored polynomial (thus allowing polynomials over Qp).  \n\nThere are three kinds of precision defined so far:\n* Flat precision.  The precision of every entry is just a constant value n.  This is certainly the fastest option, and frequently is perfectly adequate.\n* Jagged precision.  Each coefficient has its own precision, subject only to the precision cap of the base ring.  This is mainly for backward compatibility, but might also be useful in generating functions (maybe?).\n* Newton precision.  The Newton polygon of the polynomial and of the precision are stored.  This is the default precision type, since it provides a compromise between the previous two types, and having precision above the Newton polygon is useless for evaluating the polynomial anyway.\n\nI'll write more about the contents of the individual patches and some more of the contents tomorrow morning.",

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
I will build a copy of 4.7.1.alpha2 overnight and port the patches to there.

The key idea of this patch is that a polynomial over Zp should not be stored as a list of coefficients, but instead as an element of ZZ[x], together with some sort of precision object that records the precision to which each coefficient is known.  There are two main benefits of this approach:
1. One can use fast algorithms for things like polynomial multiplication, rather than being forced back on naive multiplication due to a desire to preserve precision.  For example, Karatsuba multiplication uses the identity

(f<sub>0</sub> + x<sup>n</sup> f<sub>1</sub>) (g<sub>0</sub> + x<sup>n</sup> g<sub>1</sub>) = (f<sub>0</sub> g<sub>0</sub>) + (f<sub>1</sub> g<sub>1</sub>) x<sup>2n</sup> + ((f<sub>0</sub> + f<sub>1</sub>)(g<sub>0</sub> + g<sub>1</sub>) - f<sub>0</sub> g<sub>0</sub> - f<sub>1</sub> g<sub>1</sub>)x<sup>n</sup>

This can lose precision over the naive definition since there are more additions than needed.  But if one computes an approximation over ZZ and then determines precision separately, one can use Karatsuba or FFT algorithms at will.
1. If one wants to use different methods for tracking precision (see below), the separation makes the implementation more modular and thus easier to implement and maintain.

These patches implement two kinds of polynomials: an anchored polynomial type which stores an approximation (in ZZ[x] for example) and a precision object, and a floating polynomial type which stores a common power of p for all the coefficients together with an anchored polynomial (thus allowing polynomials over Qp).  

There are three kinds of precision defined so far:
* Flat precision.  The precision of every entry is just a constant value n.  This is certainly the fastest option, and frequently is perfectly adequate.
* Jagged precision.  Each coefficient has its own precision, subject only to the precision cap of the base ring.  This is mainly for backward compatibility, but might also be useful in generating functions (maybe?).
* Newton precision.  The Newton polygon of the polynomial and of the precision are stored.  This is the default precision type, since it provides a compromise between the previous two types, and having precision above the Newton polygon is useless for evaluating the polynomial anyway.

I'll write more about the contents of the individual patches and some more of the contents tomorrow morning.

Should apply against 4.7.1.alpha4.  One can apply only 6084_ALL.2.patch, with the rest existing so that one can view code on trac.

The breakdown into patches is not the best, but here's a description.
Patch 1: Some changes to polynomials and power series to allow leading terms that are indistinguishable from 0.
Patch 2: Original changes outside both sage.rings.padics and sage.rings.polynomial.
Patch 3: Changes to sage.rings.padics
Patch 4: The new code in sage.rings.polynomial
Patch 5: A small change to polynomial_ring_constructor to allow arbitrary kwds to be passed on to polynomial ring `__init__` methods.
Patch 6: First update, bugfixes
Patch 7: Second update, bugfixes
Patch 8: Third update, bugfixes
Patch 9: Fourth update, bugfixes
Patch 10: Removing an ill-advised attempt to use fmpz_montgomery types to speed up computations for polynomials over Zp with p odd.

If reviewers would like, I can split up the ALL patch into more reasonable chunks.  Suggestions are welcome.  Bugs still remain, which I will continue to hunt down.
