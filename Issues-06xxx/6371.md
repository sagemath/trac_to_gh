Fredrik, somewhere in here there are lots of calls to the incomplete gamma function.  I used low precision as much as possible as you will see, because I don't really need high precision, I just need large outputs.

Chris, this applies against 4.0.2.alpha1 at least.  Documentation and testing appreciated!

Over the past month or two I've done considerable work vetting out the bugs and errors in the above code. Within a week or so I hope to post a replacement patch. Hence, the change of owner. I'll keep everyone who's interested posted on my progress.

A word of warning, though: since I know a lot of people who are interested in my getting Riemann theta into Sage as soon as possible I had to strip Shimura phi, Siegel theta, and Klein P. I'm not qualified to review / bug fix that part of the code. I hope this is okay with the original authors and people who are interested in seeing this patch resolved. Perhaps we can move these implementations into a new patch once Riemann theta is implemented.

Again, I'll be posting a replacement patch sometime within the next two weeks or so.

I am the original author, and I think this is a very reasonable decision!  You should know that I use "Siegel theta" and "Riemann theta" interchangeably.  Riemann theta often seems to mean just with characteristics (0, 0, ..., 0) and Siegel theta seems to be a Mathematica-ism.  Whatever we decide on is (probably) fine by me.

These bits are interesting for my research, but probably are not all that interesting more generally.  Cut them for now.

Thanks for you efforts, Chris!

I tried just deleting the first patch called "trac_6371-riemann-theta.patch" but I don't have permissions to do so. I'm also unfamiliar with how to tell patchbot to ignore certain patches.

A manual importing of the three patches using ``sage -hg import <the patch>`` results in no issues.

I see. The error is:

```

However, I'm not qualified to make a fix since I don't really understand the purpose of this test. Does anyone on cc: know what's going on in this file and why my Riemann Theta code would affect it?

Yes, I read this ticket but I'm not sure how to resolve the "potential leakiness".

One candidate for where this issue might be coming from is my use of a class constructor. I have some code in `riemann_theta.py` in the following form:

```
def RiemannTheta_Constructor(foo, bar):
    class RiemannTheta(Function_RiemannTheta):
        def __init__(...):
            self.foo = foo
            self.bar = bar
            Function_RiemannTheta.__init__()

    return RiemannTheta(...)

RiemannTheta = RiemannTheta_Constructor

class Function_RiemannTheta(BuiltinFunction):
   ...
```

I needed to do things this way so I could parameterize `RiemannTheta` by things such as directional derivative and Riemann matrix. Otherwise, things behave not as expected due to the way `BuiltinFunction` behaves. (For example, two instances of `RiemannTheta` would share the same Riemann matrix or derivatives.)

It was my misunderstanding that `BuiltinFunction` is necessary for doing symbolic manipulation. My only reason for using it is so I can compute derivatives, etc. If you know of an alternate way to enable symbolics then I'd love to hear about it!

> Your objects however depend on a parameter Omega, and are functions only of z. They are maps `theta(Omega): CC^g --> CC : z |--> theta(z)`. This will not be a "built-in function of Sage" for every Omega, so it does not sound to me like this should be a `BuiltinFunction` object. Maybe the memory leak is caused by this.


I'll experiment with the code and see if this is an issue.

In practice, $\Omega$ is treated more as a parameter than an argument of the Riemann theta function. That is, $\Omega$ is usually fixed and $z$ varies. Several users of my code would like to see this behavior be reflected by having the Riemann theta function be "initialized" by this matrix.

However, if memory leaks are unavoidable in this context then I suppose I'll just have to make $\Omega$ behave like an argument no different from $z$.

> The function `theta: CC^g x H_g --> CC : (z, Omega) |--> theta(z, Omega)` definitely make sense as a built-in function, but not a function `theta(Omega) : CC^g --> C` that depends on Omega. In other words, if you have a function for which Omega is not a parameter but an actual variable, then that would make a good built-in function.


Makes sense.

Of course! (As an in-terminal emacs user I usually try to do this anyway.)

I don't: I've never implemented any of them.

:) Actually, when I use theta functions in my research, Omega is usually the variable and z is usually some fixed vector in with entries in QQ.

Anyway, what is the (programming technical) reason for having objects that depend on Omega? Is there some kind of caching involved? Some part of the algorithm that depends on Omega only and that you only want to do once?

A student will be doing a summer project towards getting Riemann theta functions, their directional derivatives, and characteristics into sage. Can we repurpose this ticket for that?

The work is done:

https://github.com/nbruin/RiemannTheta

I have for now published it as a separate pip-able package in the hope that makes it easier for non-sage developers to install it, use it, and comment on it, but eventually the proper place is probably within sage (it's not a lot of code and it's tightly bound to a lot of sage-specific functionality). So the question prior to making a branch for inclusion into sage:

* functionality and correctness checks. We tried to be careful, but testing generally needs to be done by other people too to get a good idea of how the code performs more generally
* where to put it into sage? (sage.numerical would be appropriate, or we could place it next to riemann_surfaces because theoretically that's what it's close too -- although of course theta functions are properties of complex lattices, not particularly of Riemann surfaces.
* do riemann_theta and siegel_reduction go in the same spot?

Also, once it's in, where/how do we expose the functionality in the global namespace (if at all)? Note that the design is a little less ambitious than the cswiercz and no attempt is made to have an `SR` wrapper of the numerical tool. It does have the big advantage that, as far as I know, the code produces answers of the accuracy one can reasonably expect and does so with reasonable efficiency.
