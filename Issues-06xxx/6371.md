Fredrik, somewhere in here there are lots of calls to the incomplete gamma function.  I used low precision as much as possible as you will see, because I don't really need high precision, I just need large outputs.

Chris, this applies against 4.0.2.alpha1 at least.  Documentation and testing appreciated!

I am the original author, and I think this is a very reasonable decision!  You should know that I use "Siegel theta" and "Riemann theta" interchangeably.

These bits are interesting for my research, but probably are not all that interesting more generally.  Cut them for now.

Thanks for you efforts, Chris!

I tried just deleting the first patch called "trac_6371-riemann-theta.patch" but I don't have permissions to do so. I'm also unfamiliar with how to tell patchbot to ignore certain patches.

A manual importing of the three patches using ``sage -hg import <the patch>`` results in no issues.

I see. The error is:

```

However, I'm not qualified to make a fix since I don't really understand the purpose of this test. Does anyone on cc: know what's going on in this file and why my Riemann Theta code would affect it?

Yes, I read this ticket but I'm not sure how to resolve the "potential leakiness".

One candidate for where this issue might be coming from is my use of a class constructor. I have some code in `riemann_theta.py` in the following form:

```
def RiemannTheta_Constructor(foo, bar):
    class RiemannTheta(Function_RiemannTheta):
        def __init__(...):
            self.foo = foo
            self.bar = bar
            Function_RiemannTheta.__init__()

    return RiemannTheta(...)

RiemannTheta = RiemannTheta_Constructor

class Function_RiemannTheta(BuiltinFunction):
   ...
```

I needed to do things this way so I could parameterize `RiemannTheta` by things such as directional derivative and Riemann matrix. Otherwise, things behave not as expected due to the way `BuiltinFunction` behaves. (For example, two instances of `RiemannTheta` would share the same Riemann matrix or derivatives.) With the above code structure I found that these issues don't arise and two instances of `RiemannTheta` behaved independently as expected.

It was my misunderstanding that `BuiltinFunction` is necessary for doing symbolic manipulation. My only reason for using it is so I can compute derivatives, etc. If you know of an alternate way to enable symbolics then I'd love to hear about it!

> Your objects however depend on a parameter Omega, and are functions only of z. They are maps `theta(Omega): CC^g --> CC : z |--> theta(z)`.

I'll experiment with the code and see if this is an issue.

In practice, $\Omega$ is treated more as a parameter than an argument of the Riemann theta function. That is, $\Omega$ is usually fixed and $z$ varies. Several users of my code would like to see this behavior be reflected by having the Riemann theta function be "initialized" by this matrix.

However, if memory leaks are unavoidable in this context then I suppose I'll just have to make $\Omega$ behave like an argument no different from $z$.

> The function `theta: CC^g x H_g --> CC : (z, Omega) |--> theta(z, Omega)` definitely make sense as a built-in function, but not a function `theta(Omega) : CC^g --> C` that depends on Omega.

Makes sense.

Of course! (As an in-terminal emacs user I usually try to do this anyway.)

I don't: I've never implemented any of them.

:) Actually, when I use theta functions in my research, Omega is usually the variable and z is usually some fixed vector in with entries in QQ.

Anyway, what is the (programming technical) reason for having objects that depend on Omega? Is there some kind of caching involved? Some part of the algorithm that depends on Omega only and that you only want to do once?

<a id='comment:52'></a>The work is done:

https://github.com/nbruin/RiemannTheta

I have for now published it as a separate pip-able package in the hope that makes it easier for non-sage developers to install it, use it, and comment on it, but eventually the proper place is probably within sage (it's not a lot of code and it's tightly bound to a lot of sage-specific functionality). So the question prior to making a branch for inclusion into sage:

* functionality and correctness checks. We tried to be careful, but testing generally needs to be done by other people too to get a good idea of how the code performs more generally
* where to put it into sage? (sage.numerical would be appropriate, or we could place it next to riemann_surfaces because theoretically that's what it's close too -- although of course theta functions are properties of complex lattices, not particularly of Riemann surfaces.
* do riemann_theta and siegel_reduction go in the same spot?

Also, once it's in, where/how do we expose the functionality in the global namespace (if at all)? Note that the design is a little less ambitious than the cswiercz and no attempt is made to have an `SR` wrapper of the numerical tool. It does have the big advantage that, as far as I know, the code produces answers of the accuracy one can reasonably expect and does so with reasonable efficiency.
