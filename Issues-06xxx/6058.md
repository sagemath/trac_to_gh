Sage should provide basic statistics functionality at the top level.  These functions might use scipy.stats or R or a new native implementation.  For graphics in particular we should probably bypass R.  

This ticket will merely start this process with one patch, but will not completely address the needed functionality.

Two quick comments:

* With the mean function, dividing by `len(a_list)` is **really** dangerous -- for instance, if you give the function a collection of Python `int`s, then it will do Python `int` division -- so `3/2 = 1`, etc. Bad news.

* Do we want to use the name `std` for standard deviation? Since the other systems (e.g. R) use that, we should have it available, but I would also like to have the full `standard_deviation` available (especially since we have `variance` as opposed to just `var`, for obvious reasons).

This apparently was done at around the same time as this was posted by #7197, and no one noticed.  Sorry, Marshall :( but on the plus side we have had this since Sage 4.3 :)

To release manager - this is invalid/dup.
