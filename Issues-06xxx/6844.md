The spkg-install for readline does a lot of silly things. 

* It does a grep on /etc/SuSE-release even if the file does not exist. 
* It adds  -m64 only on OS X if SAGE64 is set to 'yes'
* It adds -m64 as a linker flag, even though no such linker flags exists on any linker I can find. 

It needs a cleanup. I'll do this.
