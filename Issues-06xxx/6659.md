Here is a patch, based on the networkx code, which implements some of the optimizations noted in the paper referenced in the networkx documentation.  This leads to what I think are asymptotic speedups.

As for the bug, before, the doctest added would fail from an error in the networkx code.  Now it does not.

I fixed a bug (the doctest I added used to fail), implemented some optimizations that massively sped things up, and cleaned up the documentation.

Robert or Rob, can one of you review this so it can go into 4.1.1?

An example of a speedup:

BEFORE:

```
sage: a=random_matrix(GF(2), 50000, density=0.0001,sparse=True)
sage: len(a.nonzero_positions())
125063
sage: c=DiGraph(50000)
sage: c.add_edges(a.nonzero_positions())
sage: %time
sage: e=c.cores(with_labels=True)
CPU time: 429.14 s,  Wall time: 430.89 s
```

AFTER:

```
sage: d=c.cores(with_labels=True)
CPU time: 1.86 s,  Wall time: 1.86 s
sage: e==d
True
```
