REFEREE REPORT:

1. Awesome trace of product trick!

2. I think the following range must start at 1 -- otherwise this is potentially (in theory) a major bug:

```
span = [self.hecke_operator(n) for n in range(2, bound+1) if not self.is_anemic() or gcd(n, level) == 1] 
```

3. "eisenstein" should be capitalized below:

```
 	1182	        Returns whether self is cuspidal, i.e. has no eisenstein part.
```

4. The patch doesn't seem to apply cleanly to 4.1.2.alpha1:

```
Hunk #4 FAILED at 214
1 out of 6 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/modular/hecke/algebra.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
