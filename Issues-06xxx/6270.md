This adds the 8 files to the reference manual (since kcrisman has put so much work into getting them to 100% coverage).  It also adds a few cross-references to plot.py and makes one or two small changes (e.g., it removes a reference to `rgbcolor` at the beginning of plot.py, since that function isn't in the global name space, and its mention suggested that it might be).

After applying the patch, the following modules are in the reference manual, but the ReST formatting need some polishing:

```
sage/plot/circle
sage/plot/disk
```
The following are referred to in the reference manual, but are not yet in the manual. So there's no hyperlink to any of them even if one is defined.

```
line()
implicit_plot()
region_plot()
scatter_plot()
bar_chart()
contour_plot()
density_plot()
plot_vector_field()
plot_slope_field()
matrix_plot()
complex_plot()
```
I can give the patch a positive review for adding files under the `sage/plot` directory to the reference manual. The formatting and referencing issues I mentioned above are **not** introduced by the patch, and should be addressed in another ticket. So patches should be applied in the following order:
1. apply the patch at #6257
2. then apply the patch on this ticket.
