polybori-0.5rc.p7/patches/

DefaultBuild = Default
if distribute or rpm_generation or deb_generation:
    def DefaultBuild(arg):
        return arg

defaultenv = Environment()

def sonameprefix(env):
    if env['PLATFORM']=="darwin":
        return "-Wl,-dylib_install_name -Wl,"
    else:
        return '-Wl,-soname,'


It needs modifying if the OS is Solaris and the linker is not GNU, but I don't know how to do it.

I've now got this fixed, thanks in no small part to the help of Arnaud Bergeron, as my python skills are next to useless. 


The patch is here. 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/polybori/

Since the SConstruct file has been patched many times, I also created a diff from the last version (p7).

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/polybori/SConstruct-diff-from-p7.patch

since a patch from the original source is very large. 


I will have gcc 4.4.0 using the Sun linker and assembler on t2 very soon. so perhaps someone can review it.

FWIW, the actual code which decided on what flags to use is below. 

```
def sonameprefix(env):

    if env['PLATFORM']=="darwin":

        # if GNU in os.system('ld --version 2>&1 /dev/null '):

           print ("You are using the GNU linker on Solaris. Linker flag set to -soname")
           print ("Genererally, the Sun linker is recked to be better on Solaris")
           print ("but Sage has been built using the GNU linker")

After uncompressing polybori-0.5rc.p9.spkg, I see a junk file:

```
[mvngu@sage polybori-0.5rc.p9]$ hg st
M SPKG.txt
M patches/SConstruct
M patches/custom.py
? patches/SConstruct.p7
```
namely `patches/SConstruct.p7`. If you've patched the relevant scripts/build files, can you please remove the junk files? Afterwards, if you're not comfortable with checking in changes using Mercurial, I can deal with that.
