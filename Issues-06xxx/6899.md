```
Here's a simple example:

```
sage: a = real((-I*float(1))^2); a
-1.00000000000000
sage: float(a)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't convert complex to float; use abs(z)
sage: b = a.simplify(); b
-1.0
sage: float(b)
-1.0
```

Dylan Thurston reported this on sage-support, but in a more complicated situation involving plotting.

The issue is that `ComplexNumber.__float__` was automatically throwing an error.  However, that method is used for `_conversions_` as well as coercions.  I made it work when the complex number is actually real.

Attachment: **[trac_6899.take2.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6899/trac_6899.take2.patch.gz)**

[attachment: trac_6899.take2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6899/trac_6899.take2.patch.gz) doesn't go through python function calls for the conversions. Thus, it is much faster.

With the python calls to `.is_real()` and `.real_part()`:

```
sage: t = CC([2^20,0])
sage: float(t)
1048576.0
sage: %timeit u = float(t)
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.48 Âµs per loop
```

Using mpfr directly:

```
sage: t = CC([2^20,0])
sage: float(t)
1048576.0
sage: %timeit u = float(t)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 221 ns per loop
```

I give a positive review to Mike's changes. Mike, can you look over the two lines I touched?

I see several doctest failures in rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx (sorry, can't cut and paste it here) involving the stable_hash function.  

Other than that passes tests in sage/rings and plot/complex_plot (perhaps a doctest should be added somewhere in plot/plot that shows this works?), and the mpfr fix seems appropriate, though perhaps an expert should weigh in...
