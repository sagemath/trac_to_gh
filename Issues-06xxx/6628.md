The attached patch implements the following:

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(127),10,'x')
sage: I = Ideal(P.random_element() for _ in range(3000))
sage: from sage.libs.singular.function import singular_function, lib
sage: groebner = singular_function('groebner')
sage: %time groebner(I)
CPU times: user 0.07 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.08 s
Wall time: 0.08 s
[1]
```

For comparison, the Singular pexpect interface needs almost two seconds for the same task (due to string parsing on both ends, IPC, etc.)

```
sage: %time I.groebner_basis()
CPU times: user 0.96 s, sys: 0.24 s, total: 1.21 s
Wall time: 1.92 s
[1]
```

This patch requires an updated Singular SPKG (see below).

Hi!
It looks very promosing.
However, I have difficulties to apply the patch.
Using sage-4.1.0 and the updated singular spkg:

I tried it with and without the refactoring patch, also using a fresh installation:

Hi Michael, this is strange, here is what works for me

* I installed the new Singular SPKG
* `hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6596/libsingular_refactoring.patch.gz`
* `hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6628/libsingular_functions.patch.gz`
* `sage -b`

I have no failed hunks etc. with that.

Here some different timings with even better factor: opposite kind of example: very tiny input, output and almost nothing to compute, replaces some
singular interpreter call via pexpect with libsingular kernel function call

```python
from sage.libs.singular import function as sf
intersect=sf.SingularKernelFunction("intersect")
sage: P.<x,y,z>=QQ[]
sage: j=P.ideal(x,z)
sage: i=P.ideal(x,y)
sage: timeit("z=i.intersection(j)")
125 loops, best of 3: 5.12 ms per loop
sage: timeit("z=intersect(i,j)")
625 loops, best of 3: 60.9 µs per loop

This stuff is great!  I've attached a small referee patch that fixes some very minor typos.

I will note that line 280 of `singular-cdefs.pxi` is not entirely confidence-inspiring, but I believe the best way to test and refine this stuff is to get it into Sage and start using it a lot.

Note to the release manager: as pointed out above, one must first merge the new Singular spkg, and the patch(es) at #6596.

The referee patch looks good. I think the next step would be to port stuff in `multi_polynomial_ideal.py` to use this new stuff and see what happens.

Indeed.  I'm expecting awesomeness (more Singular functionality readily exposed in Sage), speed, and the occasional bug fix.

I'll try to have a look at #6596 soon, but it's a bit bigger, and it will probably take a few days.

regarding 280:
I was a little bit confused, as I thought it would be the same type in idrec and sleftv.
But it's indeed void* in sleftv, so the code is correct, but the comment is wrong.
Nothing dangerous, you can remove the warning.
