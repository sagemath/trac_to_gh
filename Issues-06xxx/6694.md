I've attached a first take.  I haven't tested it extensively, but it seems to work for several pages at different depths in the reference manual's hierarchy.

Should we change the green background color for Sage output?  Perhaps we can insert a CSS directive after `default.css` in `twist.py` (see lines 194+).

Actually, the patch is not specific to the manual, so we should be able to add other complex documents, including textbooks, specialized tutorials, etc.

This seems to work great, and I would give it a positive review except that I just saw William Stein comment that in his notebook refactoring he is switching all path joining to use os.path.join.  In this patch, there are lines:

path = self.docpath + '/' + '/'.join(segments) 

and

path = self.docpath + '/' + '/'.join(segments[ind:])

that should be changed to use os.path.join().

No problem.  To really tax a browser, try "evaluating all" cells in a long section of the manual.
