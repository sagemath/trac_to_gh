```
This is in sage-3.4.2:

```
sage: delta_qexp(K=GF(5))
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZX.ntl_ZZX'> to an integer
```

I don't have time to investigate this right now, but it might be a similar issue as #5102.


Keywords: **delta q-expansion finite field**

Component: **modular forms**

This is pretty interesting: I get entirely different timings on my laptop, which is why I didn't remove the NTL code. I wonder if something funky went on with my FLINT compilation?

The `NTL` version:

```
sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.50 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.52 s
Wall time: 0.53 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 1.04 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 1.08 s
Wall time: 1.15 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 2.08 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 2.18 s
Wall time: 2.20 s
```

The `FLINT` version:

```
sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 1.01 s, sys: 0.35 s, total: 1.36 s
Wall time: 1.37 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 2.08 s, sys: 0.70 s, total: 2.78 s
Wall time: 2.81 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 4.34 s, sys: 1.46 s, total: 5.80 s
Wall time: 5.88 s
```

That seems really weird ... I'm going to try looking at this tomorrow when I'm sitting next to you. This is kinda weird; I'd like to do some random timing comparisons.

On my 32-bit Linux laptop, I get these timings:

With NTL:

```
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.95 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.99 s
Wall time: 1.01 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 2.03 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 2.06 s
Wall time: 2.08 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 4.46 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 4.59 s
Wall time: 4.91 s
```

With FLINT, i.e. with the "if False" hack:

```
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.76 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.83 s
Wall time: 0.85 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 1.62 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 1.78 s
Wall time: 1.79 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 3.50 s, sys: 0.40 s, total: 3.91 s
Wall time: 4.03 s
```

So FLINT is faster for me (but not by so much as for William).

As I said #6671 I merge this with the new code given there. I did some timings and the result is clear: Coercion into the new ring after using FLINT is fast.
Timeing:

```
sage: P = PowerSeriesRing(GF(7), 'q')
sage: from sage.modular.modform.vm_basis import _delta_poly

sage: %timeit P(_delta_poly(50).list(), check = True)
625 loops, best of 3: 407 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _delta_poly(50, GF(7))
625 loops, best of 3: 1.41 ms per loop

sage: %timeit P(_delta_poly(10**5).list(), check = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 620 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _delta_poly(10**5, GF(7))
5 loops, best of 3: 1.62 s per loop

sage: %timeit h = P(_delta_poly(10**6).list(), check = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 7.98 s per loop
sage: %timeit h =_delta_poly(10**6, GF(7))
5 loops, best of 3: 16.9 s per loop

```

I conclude that it is better to wait for Craig's new code. If nobody is opposed I will asked the current release manager (I think it's Minh) to make this as closed (since it is fixed by #6671).
