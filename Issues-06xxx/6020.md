This is in sage-3.4.2:

```
sage: delta_qexp(K=GF(5))
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.libs.ntl.ntl_ZZX.ntl_ZZX'> to an integer
```

I don't have time to investigate this right now, but it might be a similar issue as #5102.

Changing 

```

```
to

```
 if False and K is ZZ:
```
results in code that is way *faster*!  That's because FLINT kick's NTL's ass, and FLINT is the default for poly's over ZZ now.  Just get rid of the flint implementation.

With NTL (on my OS X laptop):

```

With the "False" as above inserted, so FLINT gets used:

This is pretty interesting: I get entirely different timings on my laptop, which is why I didn't remove the NTL code. I wonder if something funky went on with my FLINT compilation?

The `NTL` version:

```
sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.50 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.52 s
Wall time: 0.53 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 1.04 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 1.08 s
Wall time: 1.15 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 2.08 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 2.18 s
Wall time: 2.20 s
```

The `FLINT` version:

```
sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 1.01 s, sys: 0.35 s, total: 1.36 s
Wall time: 1.37 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 2.08 s, sys: 0.70 s, total: 2.78 s
Wall time: 2.81 s

sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 4.34 s, sys: 1.46 s, total: 5.80 s
Wall time: 5.88 s
```

That seems really weird ... I'm going to try looking at this tomorrow when I'm sitting next to you. This is kinda weird; I'd like to do some random timing comparisons.

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
On my 32-bit Linux laptop, I get these timings:

With NTL:

```
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.95 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 0.99 s
Wall time: 1.01 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 2.03 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 2.06 s
Wall time: 2.08 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 4.46 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 4.59 s
Wall time: 4.91 s
```

With FLINT, i.e. with the "if False" hack:

```
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(50000)
CPU times: user 0.76 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.83 s
Wall time: 0.85 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(100000)
CPU times: user 1.62 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 1.78 s
Wall time: 1.79 s
sage: sage: time b = delta_qexp(200000)
CPU times: user 3.50 s, sys: 0.40 s, total: 3.91 s
Wall time: 4.03 s
```

So FLINT is faster for me (but not by so much as for William).

I'm going to fix this soon, at SD15 if not before. (Me giving three talks during SD15 may prevent it from happening before.)

Here's the status, though: we've discovered that on 64-bit OSX and on `sage.math`, it's much faster to just call the naive code (the `else` clause in the patch above.

I'm changing the status to something slightly snarky to summarize the above. :)

As I said #6671 I merge this with the new code given there. I did some timings and the result is clear: Coercion into the new ring after using FLINT is fast.
Timeing:

```
sage: P = PowerSeriesRing(GF(7), 'q')
sage: from sage.modular.modform.vm_basis import _delta_poly

sage: %timeit P(_delta_poly(50).list(), check = True)
625 loops, best of 3: 407 µs per loop
sage: %timeit _delta_poly(50, GF(7))
625 loops, best of 3: 1.41 ms per loop

sage: %timeit P(_delta_poly(10**5).list(), check = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 620 ms per loop
sage: %timeit _delta_poly(10**5, GF(7))
5 loops, best of 3: 1.62 s per loop

sage: %timeit h = P(_delta_poly(10**6).list(), check = True)
5 loops, best of 3: 7.98 s per loop
sage: %timeit h =_delta_poly(10**6, GF(7))
5 loops, best of 3: 16.9 s per loop

```

I conclude that it is better to wait for Craig's new code. If nobody is opposed I will asked the current release manager (I think it's Minh) to make this as closed (since it is fixed by #6671).
