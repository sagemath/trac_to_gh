Looks good, applies fine to 4.1.alpha2 and tests pass (I tested all schemes/elliptic_curves).

Is it possible to add a doctest illustrating the suggestion to "try an_padic instead"?  That would be useful for the reference manual.  Of course, an_padic has its own tests but it would look good to include one right after one of the new tests which shows the message.
