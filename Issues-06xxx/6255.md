Hi there,

I just attached two patches. They need to be applied in

```
$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Sphinx-1.1.2-py2.7.egg/sphinx/
```
(I didn't regenerate a spkg yet). Those two packages are very experimental and
they certainly break a lot of things. The goal of `timing.patch` is to
improve Sphinx timning and progress report. The second one uses
`@parallel` to parallelize the writing part of the doc generation. This is
very raw and could certainly be optimized using Pool, Queue and the
like. Still the improvement is allready here:
On a intel i7 8 multithreaded core:
- serie:

```
reading sources...  Elapsed time = 385.334967136
writing output...  Elapsed time = 1903.10733795
```
- parallel:

```
reading sources...  Elapsed time = 418.675282001
writing output...  Elapsed time = 253.907614946
```
On a 24 core server:
- serie:

```
reading sources...  Elapsed time = 243.982397079
writing output...  Elapsed time = 1366.98643208
```
- parallel:

```
reading sources...  Elapsed time = 243.729380131
writing output...  Elapsed time = 176.76424408
```

With a little tunning I managed to have

```
serie    writing output...  Elapsed time = 1366.98643208
parallel writing output...  Elapsed time = 106.421586037
```
Looks efficient !
