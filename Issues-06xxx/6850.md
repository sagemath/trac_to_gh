The patch `trac_6531-restify_generic_ring-rebase.patch` at #6531 was intended to provide documentation and doctests for the module `sage/rings/ring.pyx`. It was also meant to add that module to the reference manual, but doesn't really make any changes to `doc/en/reference/rings.rst` to allow this.

Sorry, that was my fault -- David's original patch did make the necessary changes to the .rst file but somehow that was carried forward into the patch I made.

The patch applies and builds fine (on top of the new one at #6531).
