Attachment [trac_6715-spell-check-logic.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket6715/trac_6715-spell-check-logic.patch) by @haraldschilly created at 2009-08-14 10:18:39

looks good, only comments and doc-lines touched, no code or doctests.

there is just a "newline missing" note from mercurial at the bottom of the first part of the first patch. i think it is still ok, though (line 123 in sage/logic/booleval.py, first patch).
