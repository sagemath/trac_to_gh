ZeroDivisionError: fraction field element division by zero
```
One can see from the line that causes the error that the calculation of the *y*-component of the isogeny involves a division by *m*, which in this case is the characteristic of the ground field.

I wrote the offending line of code, knowing full well that it would not work in the inseparable case.  I may or may not have made a ticket at the time, but likely not.

When someone writes code to deal with the inseparable case, just make sure that it continues to be efficient in the separable case!
