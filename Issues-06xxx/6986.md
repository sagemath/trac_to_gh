A while ago, on http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/caac9691d6fb0160, it was voted to move PIL from optional to standard.  However, this was never done.

The spkg lives in the optional repository.

I suppose that since I'm not the author, I can review this.  Plenty of people applied it on their systems (see the above thread), so positive review.
