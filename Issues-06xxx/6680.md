Hello everybody !!!

Here are several new functions for the Graph class in Sage : 
* def min_dominating_set(g, value_only=False,log=0):
* def min_independent_dominating_set(g, value_only=False,log=0):
* def min_vertex_cover(g,value_only=False,log=0):
* def max_matching(g,value_only=False, use_edge_labels=True):
* def max_flow(g,x,y,value_only=True,integer=False, use_edge_labels=True):
* def min_edge_cut(g,s,t,value_only=True,use_edge_labels=True):
* def min_vertex_cut(g,s,t,value_only=True):
* def edge_connectivity(g,value_only=True,use_edge_labels=True):
* def vertex_connectivity(g,value_only=True):

If you have no LP Solver installed, you can download GLPK or CBC from this address : http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/
