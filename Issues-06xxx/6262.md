Even with no worksheets active, with sage-4.0.1 the server takes a long time to quit after pressing ctrl-C.  This did not use to be the case, and is extremely annoying.  It consistently happens to me on an OS 10.5 intel mac.

That directory had 250 worksheets for admin, the only user account.  I used a new directory, and everything was very snappy.   So you are right, it must be related to the number of worksheets.  I still think its a bug - if there are no active worksheets it shouldn't take 10 minutes to save the notebook.
