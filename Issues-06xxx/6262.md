Even with no worksheets active, with sage-4.0.1 the server takes a long time to quit after pressing ctrl-C.  This did not use to be the case, and is extremely annoying.  It consistently happens to me on an OS 10.5 intel mac.

You're definitely what I'd consider a "power user".  How many worksheets do you have?  Can you move your .sage directory temporarily, and then see if you get the same behavior?
