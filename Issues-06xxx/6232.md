CADO-NFS is an implementation of the number field sieve:

```
CADO is sponsored by the French Research Agency (ANR).
It started in 2008 for 3 years. It involves 3 teams: CACAO (INRIA Nancy), TANC (INRIA Saclay), and Gerald Tenenbaumâ€™s team (IECN Nancy). 

Objectives:
 * better understand how the Number Field Sieve works
 * publish a state-of-the art implementation, not to break new
   records, but to routinely factor numbers of 155 digits
 * use that code base to try new ideas and/or new algorithms
```

The Block-Wiedemann in CADO-NFS might be of independent interest.

I use this ticket to report an issue related to CADO-NFS. I'm not sure the problem is due to Sage. I could open a separate ticket if needed.

The issue is the following. Some colleague wrote the following Sage code to call CADO-NFS
from Sage:

```
import subprocess
def my_exec_factor(nbr):
    cmd = ['/tmp/cado-nfs-1.1/factor.sh', str(nbr)]
    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    output, unused_err = process.communicate()
    retcode = process.poll()
    if retcode:
        print "Output :"
        print output
        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
    return output

res=my_exec_factor(90377629292003121684002147101760858109247336549001090677693)

r=[]
for i in res.splitlines()[-6].split(' '):
    r.append(Integer(i))
print r
```
When used with CADO-NFS 1.1, this code works fine.

However with CADO-NFS 2.1.1 it fails:

```
sage: %runfile /tmp/garambois.sage
Output :

```
My guess is that there is an interaction between the version of Python used by CADO-NFS 2.1.1 (Python 3) and the one used by Sage (Python 2.7). (Note that CADO-NFS 1.1 did not use Python but Perl instead.)

Can anybody reproduce that problem? Any idea how to solve it?

thanks to Alexander Kruppa, the solution is to undefine the environment variables PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH:

```
import subprocess, os
def my_exec_factor(nbr):
    cmd = ['/tmp/cado-nfs-2.1.1/factor.sh', str(nbr)]
    my_env = os.environ
    if my_env.has_key("PYTHONHOME"):
       my_env.pop("PYTHONHOME")
    if my_env.has_key("PYTHONPATH"):
       my_env.pop("PYTHONPATH")
    process = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, env=my_env)
    output, unused_err = process.communicate()
    retcode = process.poll()
    if retcode:
        print "Output :"
        print output
        raise subprocess.CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)
    return output
```

Hi Andrew,

> I have no access to â€‹https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs/-/issues

The relevant bit of info is https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/cado-nfs/2020-10/msg00006.html (the link was dead for yet another fallout of this infrastructure change, sorry for that). TL;DR: send me an e-mail, I'll happily open you an account.

As regards your feature request: the number field sieve as a factoring algorithm does not really make sense for numbers that small. You would be much better off trying to use another piece of code to factor 45-digit integers (check out yafu, for example). This is the reason why we didn't care to write parameter files for these sizes.

The reason for the existence of the 30-digit file is different: it's used for continuous integration.

If you really really want to factor a 45-digit number with NFS, the approach that you have taken is the right one: interpolate between nearby parameter files. A first working guess is unlikely to be "optimal", but again, there's zero chance that NFS is "optimal" in this size range anyway. (patches with contributed parameter files are welcome, of course!)
