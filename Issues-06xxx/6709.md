I added "32-bit" to the title, as this ticket was created when Sage was only building 64-bit. 

It can be closed as fixed, as all doctests have passed on Solaris or OpenSolaris both SPARC and x86 for a long time.

I mean the ticket was opened when Sage was only building 32-bit. Now it will build 64-bit, but does not work very well in 64-bit mode.
