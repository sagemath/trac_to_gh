I have implemented the rules for restriction and tensor products found in Thm 4.5 and Cor 4.7 (pages 15 and 18):

http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2268

The backbone is a recursive algorithm to compute tensor products.

```
u/chapoton/supercharacters
```
containing Franco's rather complete implementation. It almost works and needs more documentation.
