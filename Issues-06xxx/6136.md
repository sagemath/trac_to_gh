- Deprecates CombinatorialAlgebra
- Abstracts some of the generic code into ModulesWithBasis, Algebras, ...
- Implements the functorial constructions: tensor and cartesian product
- Stronger type checking, use UniqueRepresentation
- Disabled dangerous conversions (see doc of _element_constructor), strict __contains__
- Naming cleanup: _term -> term, __repr__ -> _repr_, _element_class -> element_class
  _combinatorial_class -> _basis_keys
- New methods: monomial, sum_of_terms, sum_of_monomials, term_or_zero_if_none, from_vector,
  _repr_term, _repr_option_bracket
- More interesting an_element, using heuristics
- Handle non sortable objects in repr
- Implements sage.categories.poor_man_map.PoorManMap for maps between
  sets which are not modelled by parents.
- This is used to make term and sum_of_monomial into maps, with
  codomain and composition.

Depends on the category patches.

Apply only the last patch trac_6136-categories-freemodule-nt.2.patch

Note: it breaks some doctests which are corrected in #6137 (See http://sagetrac.org/sage_trac/wiki/CategoriesRoadMap)

Ready to go.
