This doctest is silently ignored:

```
Sage: 1+1
45
```

I.e. no warning is displayed, and doctesting the file it is in produces no failures. This is because I wrote Sage: rather than sage:. I don't now if other capitalizations than "sage" should be accepted, but certainly they should not be silently ignored.

I propose to report an error on "Sage:" or any other capitalization of that in any context where "sage:" would be interpreted as a doctest.

Is this **really** a problem?

1. You shouldn't be re-typing your doctests by hand; you should copy/paste an actual sage session to avoid errors.
2. This only affects one-line doctests, unless you make the same mistake more than once. For example any lines referencing `t` should fail if your first line is "Sage: var('t')".
3. If there are N tests passing before you add yours, there should be N+1 passing afterwards.
4. All patches are reviewed and this should certainly catch (3).

Yeah, this is developer error, IMO. "Sage: 1+1" is not recognized by the doctester as a test input line, and neither is "Warning: 1+1" or "Hello: World" or any other such examples. We don't (and obviously shouldn't) produce error messages for these other examples, and I see no reason why "Sage:" should get special treatment.
