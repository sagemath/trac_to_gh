Seems ok to me ! I Applied it, used it, and did not understand why it was not possible already !

By the way, I added some docstrings to the function, so if you think it is ok.. ;-)

The patch `multinomial_list.patch` contains some badly formatted docstrings. But those shouldn't prevent the patch from being merged. Better to fix those formatting issues in a separate ticket. See #6845 for a follow up to fix this docstring issue.



ncohen -- Your username should be in your patches; it makes it easier to credit you for your contributions. Please also remember to put in a sensible commit message for your patches.



While merging and testing these patches:

1. `12846.patch` -- rishi's contribution
2. `trac_6819-reviewer.patch` -- ncohen's contribution
 
I ran into a doctest failure:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/misc/getusage.py
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 69:

```
This has nothing to do with the above patches. Strangely, it crops up when I run the test on sage.math. But the test passes on mod.math and geom.math. Merged patches in this order:

1. `12846.patch`
2. `trac_6819-reviewer.patch`
