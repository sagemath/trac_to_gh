By the way, I added some docstrings to the function, so if you think it is ok.. ;-)

While merging and testing these patches:

1. `12846.patch` -- rishi's contribution
2. `trac_6819-reviewer.patch` -- ncohen's contribution
 
I ran into a doctest failure:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/misc/getusage.py
**********************************************************************
File "/scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/getusage.py", line 69:

Got:

**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:

```
This has nothing to do with the above patches. Strangely, it crops up when I run the test on sage.math. But the test passes on mod.math and geom.math. Merged patches in this order:

1. `12846.patch`
2. `trac_6819-reviewer.patch`
