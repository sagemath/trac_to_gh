```
As the summary says.  The spkg can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/sphinx-0.6.3.p1.spkg

After installing it and before building any docs, you will probably need to delete the directory SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output -- this holds cached information which may not be compatible between different versions of Sphinx.

Sphinx 0.6.3 also uses Jinja2.  Sage includes Jinja, not Jinja2.  As long as you're connected to a network, the installation of Sphinx 0.6.3 downloads Jinja2 and installs it -- it can coexist with Jinja, so it shouldn't mess anything up.  If you're not connected to a network, and for putting in the Sage tar ball, there is an spkg for Jinja2:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/jinja2-2.1.1.p0.spkg

For producing a new Sage tarball, since we're adding a new spkg, I think we need to modify the files `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps`; I've attached new versions of these.

Finally, the patch below ("inheritance_example.patch") is not required.  It provides an illustration of a new capability of Sphinx 0.6.3 (and I think it's quite nice), but it's not something that needs to be installed or reviewed for this ticket.

I installed the updated SPKG with

```
./sage -f http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/SPKG/sphinx-0.6.2.p0.spkg
```
and applied the patch at #6585. When doing

```
./sage -docbuild reference html
```
I got the following errors:

When these lines are removed, the HTML version of the reference manual builds OK. So a possible fix for line 2233 is to replace everything in the TEST block starting from that line by:

```
sage: p = PartitionsGreatestLE(10,2)
sage: p == loads(dumps(p))
True
```
We can do something similar for line 2294; replace everything in the TEST block starting from line 2294 by:

```
sage: p = PartitionsGreatestEQ(10,2)
sage: p == loads(dumps(p))
True
```
As for the TEST block starting from line 2839, I have no idea how to fix it so that the reference manual would successfully builds. Someone on the sage-combinat team to the rescue?

Apparently, the culprit is `sphinx.pycode`'s Python source analyzer, which `sphinx.ext.autodoc` uses to extract *attribute* docstrings.  From `Sphinx-0.6.2-py2.6.egg/sphinx/pycode/__init__.py`:

```
    The docstrings can either be in special '#:' comments before the assignment
    or in a docstring after it.
```
According to the analyzer, there are just two places to find such docstrings in the Sage library:
* `combinat/designs/block_design.py`
* `schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_field.py`
Still, resource use is high, because there is a **lot** of caching going on.  We can reduce it with [weak references](http://docs.python.org/library/weakref.html):

```

This does reduce build time and memory usage, but I don't know if the output is identical.

The new [inheritance diagram](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/inheritance.html?highlight=inheritance#module-sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram) extension has potential.  I've attached a minimal example.  **Please do not merge it.**

The options are limited, however.  For example, I could not find a directive that auto-generates a diagram for each module.  Also, it seems there's no way to color-code the nodes/classes, e.g., to indicate their modular provenance.  Maybe it's possible to do one or more of these ourselves, in `builder.py`, `conf.py`, or by patching Sphinx.

Some timings in minutes for "sage -docbuild reference html --jsmath", with the patch at #6664 applied:

```
                    Mac      sage.math  ubuntu
Sphinx 0.5.1         6           5        10
Sphinx 0.6.2.p2      6           6        10
Sphinx 0.6.3         8           9        11
```
"Mac" is my Intel iMac running OS X 10.5; "sage.math" is sage.math, and "ubuntu" is an old ubuntu box I have access to.

As I said above, the memory usage seems to stay within reason for all of these, but I'm not using anything sophisticated to test this: with the terrible version, my computer would become very sluggish, and with the versions tested here, that doesn't happen.

For Sage 4.1.2.alpha0's HTML reference manual, at least, the new spkg seems to work just as Georg indicated.  I'll try to do more testing soon.

By the way, it might be useful to update spkg-install along the lines of #6598 and [this example](http://wiki.sagemath.org/DavidKirkby).  For example,

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -z "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi

success() {
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error building Sphinx: '$1'"
        exit 1
    fi
}

set -e

echo "Removing old version..."
rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/python/site-packages/Sphinx-*
success 'deleting previous version'

I think it would probably best to make a separate spkg so that installation will not require network access. I've made an spkg that I can post if you want.

Also, the spkg for this states that it depends on Jinja>=``1.1``, which is no longer the case.

Thanks -- that worked!  (Except that I cannot read and deleted all SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc and not just the output directory, so had to copy the rest from another clone...)

I like the percentage meter and the fact that the output overwrites one line rather than running off the screen.  Minor point here:  it does not overwrite long lines when they are followed by short ones so you see strange garbage characters on the end of te line like this:

```
reading sources... [ 49%] sage/misc/explain_pickle      _densensephismsmpecies
```
Of course this is a triviality.

Otherwise all went well and (from the point of view of an ordinary user/developer) I'm happy with this spkg.  (There are lots of warnings and at least one error in the docstrings, but that is another matter).  I have no objection to this getting a positive review, assuming tha the other issues discussed above have been dealt with.

I updated `spkg/install` and `spkg/standard/deps`, replaced the old Sphinx spkg with the new one in `spkg/standard`, and copied the Jinja2 package to `spkg/standard`.  With these changes, `sage -bdist 100` generates the expected binary distributions on sage.math from both binary and compiled source distributions.  Moreover, `sage -sdist 200` makes a source distribution that compiles as expected.

There's a failed test:

```python
