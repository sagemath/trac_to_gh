This patch adds a function WorldMap to graph_generators.py, which lets the user load the graph in which vertices are countries and links denote a shared boundary between two of them. The data I used to build this comes from The Cia Factbook ( mentionned in the docstring )

To use it, you need to apply the patch, but also to move the file graph_world.sobj to SAGE_ROOT/data/graphs/

Thank you for your help ! :-)

I get a totally different checksum..... Good job noticing it !!!

I just retried to load the graph with a version of the file graph_world downloaded from the TRAC server and it worked for me. My checksum is the following :

```
sage: sage: g=graphs.WorldMap() 
sage: g
Graph on 251 vertices
sage: import md5 
sage: sage: md5.md5(sage.misc.misc.SAGE_DATA + 'graphs/graph_world.sobj').hexdigest()
'805fdf0227e964c41f3892c6979f62dc'
```

As I suspect it may come from some weird encoding, here is a .rar version of the file : http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/world.rar

I also copied the file on sagemath in the directory as ~/ncohen/graph_world.sobj

On my machine 

```
~$ md5sum  /usr/local/sage/data/graphs/graph_world.sobj
438bc195a9486caebeb47442ff8b8d8c  /usr/local/sage/data/graphs/graph_world.sobj
```
On sagemath 

```
ncohen@sage:~$ md5sum graph_world.sobj 
438bc195a9486caebeb47442ff8b8d8c  graph_world.sobj
```

Could you check if this version works, and if the checksum is correct ? Thank you !!!

Nathann
