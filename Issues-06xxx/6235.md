Yep, it does.  We can make sure easily enough by running Sage and asking:

sage: DOT_SAGE
'/Users/wstein/.sage/'

By the way, I just realized it is called "DOT_SAGE", not "SAGE_HOME".

I just noticed that *some* (I don't know yet which, i.e. the one from alpha2 or alpha3) matplotlib 1.0.0 spkg broke **all** previous Sage installations, due to `~/.matplotlib/`...

(And especially made testing #9896 totally useless. :( )

Without deleting `~/.matplotlib/`, I get the doctest errors in `sage/plot/` mentioned [here](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9896#comment:128).

```
if [ "$SAGE_MPLCONFIGDIR" = "" ]; then
    MPLCONFIGDIR=$DOT_SAGE/matplotlib

As mentioned above, the configuration should be inside a *specific Sage installation* hierarchy, not just yet another *user-specific* directory, which is (usually) the same for all Sage installations.

I don't understand why the matplotlib developers broke compatibility with older versions; I think it's likely to have different MPL installations included in other software packages, but I might be wrong. IMHO bad design anyway; also the exceptions raised are odd.

At the same time, this directory should not be inside a specific Sage installation (i.e., below SAGE_ROOT) since that means system-wide installs can't have individual customizations, and it also breaks system-wide font cache generation (i.e., matplotlib assumes that a user can update the font cache file, I believe).  So where are we now?  Separate matplotlib config directories for each version of Sage inside of the .sage directory?

I was thinking of that, too. Not that easy, though. (E.g. using the Sage version as an "index" isn't reliable either.)

Is the font cache the only problem? If so, we could just delete it upon every Sage [script] start-up... (quite ugly, of course)

But older versions of MPL should simply recognize config files from newer versions and e.g. (partially) ignore them. Or at least print an *appropriate* error message. (Not very pythonic, I know. *SCNR*)

I'm not sure if MPL writes anything to that during installation; it's perhaps sufficient to set MPLCONFIGDIR before *using* MPL (i.e., after installation) to fix the `TypeError` issue with parallel installations of older versions.

At least our current 1.0.0 doesn't write to / create `$HOME/.matplotlib/` during *installation*.

(I simply renamed the directory and did `./sage -f matplotlib-1.0.0`.)

Doing

```
sage: import matplotlib
```
recreates the directory (`$HOME/.matplotlib/`).

Okay, but it also works this way, and seems readable to me this way, so I'm leaving it as is.

You're right, the scripts in local/bin use "mkdir", not "$MKDIR", so I've changed that, too.

Tested with Sage 4.6.alpha3.

Also works after deletion of `$HOME/.sage/` (i.e., dirs get properly recreated s.t. MPL doesn't raise an error).

Since this fixes MPL 1.0.0 (#9221) breaking other, older Sage installations, I'm increasing the priority.

That's just what I posted to sage-release.  The relevant lines in matplotlib/texmanager.py are

```
    if not os.path.exists(texcache):
        os.mkdir(texcache)
```
so that seems a likely explanation.
