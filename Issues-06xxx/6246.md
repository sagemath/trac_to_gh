I built a Sage-4.0.1 on sage.math (a 32-bit vmware machine actually) using the SAGE_FAT_BINARY environment variable.  This set MPIR's --enable-fat option (or should have!).    I then dropped the binary on cicero (on skynet), and it does *NOT* work at all.   The problem is definitely still MPIR.  This will have to get fixed soon.
At least this nails down that MPIR is the problem, and gives me a straightforward testcase.

So I think all the "SAGE_FAT_BINARY" stuff -- the atlas only using sse2, the MPIR building FAT -- absolutely none of it works at all. 
But again, now that there is a good test system in place (build on sage.math, test on cicero), this will be fixable.

Here's a plan:

```

Fixing this is on the todo list, and I hope it happens for sage-4.1.1.  Mostly atlas and mpir are the only two packages that "cause trouble", though I'm not convinced of that -- I tried building a binary on sage.math (on a 32-bit vmware machine), then putting it on an *old* Pentium withouts ssse3 pni, and it of course wouldn't start.  Then I rebuilt atlas and mpir, and it seemed to work fine.  I then ran the test suite, which did *not* come close to passing -- so other things evidently fail.  If anybody wants to help with this, the plan is the following.

1. Fix the atlas and mpir spkg's so they definitely support the SAGE_FAT_BINARY environment variable (this might be the case already).

2. Build sage binary using the SAGE_FAT_BINARY variable set on a modern 32-bit linux box.

3. Move that binary to an old 32-bit linux box.

4. Try it out -- if it fails to start then the SAGE_FAT_BINARY flag doesn't work.   Go to 1.

5. If Sage starts, try "random_matrix(ZZ,300).det()", which will test ATLAS.  If this fails, go to 1.

6. Run the full Sage test suite.  Inspect and see what is still built using ssse3/pni, etc.  Go to 1.

The virtual machine where I was building the test binary that I could try on cicero is down, and the VMware server admin web page is also down.  I'll likely have to do a slow and painful reboot of a lot of stuff to get his fixed.   I can also try building on an old laptop that's in my office.\n\nThanks for the idea above, which I can try.\n \n -- William\n\n```",

Unfortunately, I don't have easy access to a system to replicate the problem either.  The virtual machine where I was building the test binary that I could try on cicero is down, and the VMware server admin web page is also down.  I'll likely have to do a slow and painful reboot of a lot of stuff to get his fixed.   I can also try building on an old laptop that's in my office.

Thanks for the idea above, which I can try.

More from Jason Moxham:

```

gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux/4.2.4/specs
Target: x86_64-pc-linux
Configured
with: ../gcc-4.2.4/configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared --enable-languages=ada,c,c++,fortran,java,objc --disable-multilib --enable-threads=posix --enable-__cxa_atexit --disable-checking --with-gnu-ld --verbose
--build=x86_64-pc-linux
--target=x86_64-pc-linux
--host=x86_64-pc-linux
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.2.4

These three parts

--build=x86_64-pc-linux
--target=x86_64-pc-linux
--host=x86_64-pc-linux

specify the default system , so we want to find a system where these
are "higher" than another system and then try the fat build on them , it
should fail if this is the answer

This will be easier on x86 than x86_64 as I expect gcc doesn't use the slight
differences on the 64bit arch much.

on fedora32 it gives i686.  I bet the same is true for ATLAS.
An easy option for mpir at least is just to always pass -enable-fat if
SAGE_FAT is yes , else you will need to list all cpu's in the script that
uname -m can return.
