This is the results of the Abelian groups project at SD16. This is not really finished, but I am going to be pretty busy for the next few weeks so I am posting it here anyway in the hope that somebody else will chip in and finish it off.

This relies on all of the patches at #5882.

The new functionality:

- A new class for additive abelian groups. This is very similar to the finitely presented modules class, but with a slightly different print representation. This is mostly finished (although the string representation of morphisms needs a little work).

- A class for "additive abelian groups embedded in an arbitrary parent". Think rational points on an elliptic curve, for instance, which should be able to derive from this class and transparently inherit code for things like morphisms and subgroups. This is a lot less complete.

Here are three patches: the first is the new classes, and the second make alterations to the two places where abelian groups are used "in an additive way" in the Sage library to convert them over (which I did chiefly in order to get a feel for how well it would owrk in practice).

I'm hoping that we can sort this out and get it finished!

Comments on the patches:
1. Lines 47-53 of patch 1.  Not sure I understand the issue here.  Isn't each coordinate just reduced modulo the appropriate integer (if positive)?
2. Some functionality (e.g. annihilator()) is presumably inherited from one of the base classes.  I think it would help if this was written down explicitly in comments, especially as there is more than one base class.
3. As well as an is_multiplicative() returning False, should tere not be an is_additive() returning True?  Or does that exist already from a base class?
4. You mention a black-box discrete log would be desirable.  We have that in sage/groups/generic.py -- does that do what is needed here?  Or is the problem that that only deals with the cyclic case?
5. Patch 2 looks quite simple, I have not looked at it in detail.
6. Patch 3 is mainly changes on doctest output, but also shows how some code can be simplified using the new framework, which is good.

Now I'll actually try applying the patches to 4.3 and see how it looks.

I think the 4th (review) patch does what is necessary.  Does it?  I remember doing some manual editing after applying the first three (there were some hunks rejected), and that would be reflected in the last patch.

If that does not work, ask again.  I still have that queue on my laptop.

Sorry about that.  There was only trivial rebasing needed to the first patch (it fixed some small bugs in mrange, and those had already been fixed elsewhere, so it was possible to just ignore the failing hunks).  The patch named trac_6449-1a-abgps.patch can therefore replace the one named trac_6449-1-abgps.patch, followed by -2, -3 and -review.  These apply to 4.5.alpha0 (and probably also to 4.4.4, but my 4.4.4 build is currently devoted to the pari upgrade).  I am currently testing the whole sage library -- done (see below).

If a single folded patch is still required I should be able to do that, but applying 4 patches is not as bad as on some tickets (and they are logically separate).

There is one doctest failure:

```
File "/storage/jec/sage-4.5.alpha0/devel/sage-6449/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py", line 538:
    sage: bool(T) # indirect doctest
Expected:
    False
Got:
    True
```
I suggest changing the code of that one-line function to 

```
return self.order()>1
```
but I don't actually know what is going on there as it's an indirect doctest!

Yes, that part of the patch got factored out as #6561.

Hmm. I see what's happening: that doctest assumes that elliptic curve torsion subgroups are an instance of the old `AbelianGroup` class, while the new patch makes them an instance of my new `AdditiveAbelianGroup`. Patch coming up.

Looks good, so I am putting this back to positive review (originally positively reviewed by Robert Bradshaw).

I actually made that last patch without the other patches applied :-) So I've now realised that there is a problem with applying those patches; whatever I do it won't apply cleanly. If I apply

```
trac_6449-1a-abgps.patch
trac_6449-2-homology.patch
trac_6449-3-elliptic.patch
```
then I get a bunch of rejects. If I just delete the .rej files and apply `trac_6449-review.patch` I get even more rejects, and a whole load of doctests fail in elliptic curves. I spent a while fixing them -- most were trivial (although tedious), but one stubborn failure in BSD.py required me to add half a dozen lines of new code to get the coercion system to behave itself; this isn't something that can be left to the release manager!

Since Jim and I already went through those minor doctest failures fixing them, it's a great pity that you repeated the work.

I can't be #9127 -- all that does is add three dots to a doctest output!

I'll try again with alpha1, but I am seeing tutees all afternoon.

I guess the moral here is that one can't rely on an old outdated patch always failing in exactly the same way, i.e. the selection of exactly which hunks apply and which don't seems to be a bit random. 

Anyway: another issue here is the danger of conflicts with other positively-reviewed patches which touch elliptic curves. Right now there are 13 of these from 11 tickets: 7930, 8680, 9087, 9110, 9266, 9287, 9302, 9313, 9324, 9342 and 9372. 

So I downloaded all of these, applied the patches from this ticket (including the review patch), and cleaned up the mess, and everything was fine except for one thing: there wasn't a coercion from the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve to the full M-W group, and more generally from an additive abelian group wrapper to its "universe", which causes the doctest failure in BSD.py reported in my previous message. I added an UnwrappingMorphism class to additive_abelian_wrapper which does exactly that. With that change, all doctests seem to pass.

It turns out that the patch thus obtained actually doesn't conflict with any of the other positively reviewed patches above except #9278, but you need that one installed. It passes doctests both with and without the other 10 tickets. If someone could quickly check that the new UnwrappingMorphism looks plausible, then I think this will finally be ready to merge.

The alpha1 test showed up these:

```
	sage -t  devel/sage-6449/sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py # 1 doctests failed
	sage -t  devel/sage-6449/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/BSD.py # Exception from doctest framework

	sage -t  devel/sage-6449/sage/modular/modsym/space.py # 3 doctests failed
```
where the first one is the little one fixed by youur doctest patch and the others are trivialities caused by the different output of torsion groups now.

Next I'll test the new folded patch... applies ok, starting to test.

I'm mystified that it's not working for you. I just created yet another new clone on selmer, downloading the patches afresh from trac, and it works fine there too. See session transcript below.

One order of patches that works (for me) is:

```
trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part1.patch                            
trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part2.patch                            
trac_6449_everything.patch                                                    
trac_8680-untabify-4.5.alpha1.patch                                           
trac_8680-tinyfix.patch                                                       
trac_6449_ones_that_got_away.patch                                            
```

#8680 can also come earlier in the sequence -- everything except trac_6449_ones_that_got_away.patch is independent of it.

Here's a patch with the missing doctests. The current situation is that one needs to apply:

- the #9287 patches
- trac_6449_everything.patch
- trac_6449_ones_that_got_away.patch
- trac_6449_more_doctests.patch

If someone with trac admin rights could delete all the other patches that would be helpful.

I checked that the patches as specified by David, and repeated here:

1. trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part1.patch
2. trac_9287.coverage_for_elliptic_curves_part2.patch
3. trac_6449_everything.patch
4. trac_6449_ones_that_got_away.patch
5. trac_6449_more_doctests.patch

apply ok to 4.5.alpha4.  The new doctests look fine and pass, and coverage in this directory is now 100%.

I have therefore left the tag as "positive review" and hope that mhansen is now happy!

For the record, I did *not* apply [attachment:trac_6449_ones_that_got_away.1.patch] to 4.5.2.alpha0.
