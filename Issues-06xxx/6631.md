Here is the new timing: 

```
sage: c = words.ChristoffelWord(380447,34369)
sage: time c.is_lyndon()
CPU times: user 1.15 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.15 s

That's much better.

The end of the loop can be simplified (there is no break statement in the loop, and we know that j==n at the end).

```
while j < n:
    [...]
else:
    return j - i == n
```

could become:

```
while j < n:
    [...]
return i == 0
```
