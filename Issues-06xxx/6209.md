```

```
in fmpz.c change

#include "zn_poly/zn_poly.h"

to

#include "zn_poly/src/zn_poly.h"

Also, in the FLINT makefile

-DNEBUG -> -DNDEBUG

in a couple of places. David Harvey found these.

These will fix the issues you note. The next version of FLINT due at
the end of June will have these fixes.
