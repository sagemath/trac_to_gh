There's libSingular, there's libPari, and next we need to create libGAP.  

To try it out,
* Install http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap-4.5.6.spkg from #13211
* Install http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/libgap-4.5.6.spkg
* Apply [attachment:trac_6391_libGAP.patch] to the Sage library
* Apply [attachment:trac_6391_libGAP_root.patch] to the root repository

Code in `sage/libs/gap/test/` demonstrates an interface to `libgap` from C.

<a id='comment:10'></a>Overview:

* Modified version of GAP, which is built by doing

```
sage -f -m  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/gap/gap-4.4.10.p17.spkg
wait...
cd sage/spkg/build/gap-4.4.10.p17
```
To rebuild:

```
steinz@sage:~/scratch/sage/spkg/build/gap-4.4.10.p17/src$ make
steinz@sage:~/scratch/sage/spkg/build/gap-4.4.10.p17/src/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc$ gcc -shared *.o -o libgap.so
```

* Cython code to use the Gap library:

```
In here:
   sage/devel/sage/sage/libs/gap/gap.pyx
```

If you change gap.pyx, do `sage -br` to build the changed version and start Sage.

The cached_function decorator works at the interpreter level so I really do not see what is happening. When the line is removed  the import works fine and from what I understand about cache_function this should be okay.

it turns out that cached_function won't work in Cython at all, so indeed this needs to be changed.
The cumulative patch 6391.6.patch fixed this, as well, as it supersedes the previous 4 patches.

To install for Sage 4.6.1, install the updated spkg, and this patch.

I am not so sure that we should invest a lot of time in libGAP based on the current GAP 4.4.12, as GAP 4.5 is almost ready,
(as a GAP package developer, I'm expecting to get it pretty soon) and has a lot of internals reworked. I understand that the GC is replaced by the Bohm's GC, and the arbitrary precision arithmetic is done by GMP, not by the internal GAP code (I suggested that they should try MPIR instead of GMP).

Hi Volker,
please see my current (Sage-4.6.1) snapshot, catching zero division etc.

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/gap-4.4.12.p6.spkg

It gets rid of the zero division problem. I.e. I can divide by 0 in GAP and still retain Sage/GAP session.
Here is an example (sorry for extra print statements producing noise below)

```

I'll try to get access to GAP 4.5 for Sage as soon as possible.
As I understood from GAP people, their current GC is a major headache making it hard to write a "usual" library interface, 
which might be much nicer to have...
AFAIK, Bohm's GC is more manageable in this respect.  

Well, perhaps indeed the changes in 4.5 aren't that big to warrant putting this on old.

Changes to the newest spkg:
* removed dist directory
* removed unsetting CC/CXX since "sage -sh" sets these to sane values
* converted all copied files from patches/ into patches
* using libtool to build libGAP
* Code cleanups

Basic functionality now works including trapping errors:

```
sage: import sage.libs.gap.gap as g
sage: g.libgap('1/0')
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1312, 0))

This sounds  great! What about matrices? 
(it would be even better if there was a well-explained in docs implementation example of such a conversion).
E.g. for my work I need to convert GAP matrices (or non-standard sparse GAP matrices) into CVXOPT matrices.

If a dense matrix is good enough for you then you can just convert it to a List of Lists in Gap and then use the `.sage()` method which recurses through the lists and can convert numbers:

```
sage: from sage.libs.gap.libgap import libgap
sage: M = libgap('BlockMatrix([[1,1,[[1, 2],[ 3, 4]]], [1,2,[[9,10],[11,12]]], [2,2,[[5, 6],[ 7, 8]]]],2,2)')
sage: M
<block matrix of dimensions (2*2)x(2*2)>
sage: M.List().sage()
[[1, 2, 9, 10], [3, 4, 11, 12], [0, 0, 5, 6], [0, 0, 7, 8]]
sage: matrix(ZZ,_)
[ 1  2  9 10]
[ 3  4 11 12]
[ 0  0  5  6]
[ 0  0  7  8]
```

I expect that this is caught by Sage itself rather than by GAP (Sage recognizes that an illegal division is going to happen).

I added some authors, in alphabetical order--–don't know if this is a complete list.

The error message could be a bit more helpful, but  when runnning under `sage --valgrind` it leads to a segfault.

I only applied this most recent one.  I was just wondering whether somehow I should have applied the .2.patch.  But I don't think this is the issue.

Interestingly, I get long hangs, so I think you may be right that I'm somehow missing the !sig_on stuff.  But

```
        try:            sig_on()            result = make_GapElement(self.parent(),                                     DIFF(self.value, (<GapElement>right).value))            sig_off()            return result        except RuntimeError, msg:            ClearError()            raise ValueError, 'Gap: '+str(msg)
```
is what I get for the code of `g1._sub_??`.

But I did get this scary thing:

```
sage: libgap(1)
/Users/student/Desktop/sage-4.6.2/local/bin/sage-sage: line 308: 14591 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
```
Could this is another example of using the wrong !MAC_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET or something, like it was for the initial problems with 10.6 not working... ?  Maybe that's impossible.

Hi Volker, you mentioned adding doctests etc.
Do you mean for the low-level stuff in gap.pyx ? 

Did you try completely replacing gap interface with libgap interface?
IMHO it's about time to start doing this --- this would uncover more  things to do, I imagine.

It would be great is libgap/ contained at least one C example on building a C application that links against libGAP and does something, like computing the order of a permutation group. Would be good for stress-testing, and just understanding the
interface better.
Anyone out there who has time for this now? (not me :-( ) I imagine it's more work on a makefile than on the C side.

Regarding Sage-libGAP  interface, I would like to understand what happens in a scenario when a Python object P holds
a reference to a GAP object G, and then P gets GC'ed. This should result in G getting freed (eventually) by GAP's GC.
It would be good to see an evidence that this actually does happen.

Did you check that things work with GAP workspaces (Saving/Loading workspaces, that is)?

    "body": "<a id='comment:61'></a>Hi Dima,\n\nYes everything in `libgap.pyx` is doctested. I have't tried to replace gap by libgap in the Sage library, first I want to see if the new spkg compiles on all supported platforms. But p8 uses the standard autotools to build the shared library, so I'm pretty confident.\n\nThere is a subdirectory `sage/libs/gap/test` that contains a small C program for testing purposes just like what you want.\n\nGetting garbage collection in Gap work to work correctly was one of the major issues that I worked on over the week. For starters, Gasman has no explicit reference counts. It is also compacting, so we must never hold direct pointers into the memory. The way it works is that \n1. `libgap.pyx` first creates a new Gap global variable `libgap_owned_objects` and assigns an empty `rec()` to it.\n2. Every Python `GapElement` adds is wrapped Gap object to `libgap_owned_objects`.\n3. The `GapElement.__dealloc__` removes the Gap object from `libgap_owned_objects`. It is then no longer referenced inside Gap and Gasman eventually recycles the object.\nThis is doctested in the `__dealloc__` documentation.\n\nI haven't tried saving/loading Gap workspaces. But it doesn't make much sense in libGAP since it would break the Python<->Gap object relations. If you need to load a huge pre-evaluated Gap script then you probably don't need libGAP, which is all about fast interaction with Gap.",

Yes everything in `libgap.pyx` is doctested. I have't tried to replace gap by libgap in the Sage library, first I want to see if the new spkg compiles on all supported platforms. But p8 uses the standard autotools to build the shared library, so I'm pretty confident.

There is a subdirectory `sage/libs/gap/test` that contains a small C program for testing purposes just like what you want.

Getting garbage collection in Gap work to work correctly was one of the major issues that I worked on over the week. For starters, Gasman has no explicit reference counts. It is also compacting, so we must never hold direct pointers into the memory. The way it works is that 
1. `libgap.pyx` first creates a new Gap global variable `libgap_owned_objects` and assigns an empty `rec()` to it.
2. Every Python `GapElement` adds is wrapped Gap object to `libgap_owned_objects`.
3. The `GapElement.__dealloc__` removes the Gap object from `libgap_owned_objects`. It is then no longer referenced inside Gap and Gasman eventually recycles the object.
This is doctested in the `__dealloc__` documentation.

I haven't tried saving/loading Gap workspaces. But it doesn't make much sense in libGAP since it would break the Python<->Gap object relations. If you need to load a huge pre-evaluated Gap script then you probably don't need libGAP, which is all about fast interaction with Gap.

At least the initialization of libGAP should probably use a prebuilt workspace, as is done by the current interface.
The reason is to speed it up. 

Even with Python<-> GAP relations lost, saving workspace might still make sense (if you know the GAP names of objects
created, you can get them, right?).
And I don't see why it is really lost, as is it recorded in Gap global variable libgap_owned_objects. 
Which would make it possible to re-create the corresponding Python's `GapElement` data.

OK, but it does add to libGAP startup time.

I certainly agree with this.

<a id='comment:66'></a>A relevant status update and overview from Volker:

Hi Stephen,

I wanted to contact you for a while about whether and how to integrate
the C GAP library interface that we wrote. I think it would be great
to have a well-defined shared library interface, and it sounds like
you are interested in that as well. We have a working prototype at
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6391 that just needs review
as far as I am concerned. It doesn't have a nicely abstracted
interface, but it works for Sage purposes. Let me comment on the
points in your pdf:

1) IO: we want to inject input and catch output, so we can evaluate
input strings and parse output strings. For this, we just patched
SyFgets() / PutChrTo().

2) For errors, just send a signal from the shared library. We patched
ReadEvalError() to call abort(). The user of the shared library can
then install their own signal handler if they want to catch that. I
don't think entering the break/eval loop is particularly useful in a
shared library, we just set BreakOnError = 0.

3) similarly, if the user of the library wants to interrupt a GAP
computation she can just signal SIGINT etc.

4) To keep objects alive, the Sage library interface just creates a
global GAP record (which aren't garbage collected)

   libgap_owned_objects = GVarName( "libgap_owned_objects" );
   AssGVar(libgap_owned_objects, NEW_PREC(0))

and then references any objects that are wrapped by libGAP:

   libgap_owned_objects_counter += 1
   self.libgap_owned_objects_rnam = RNamIntg(libgap_owned_objects_counter)
   AssPRec(VAL_GVAR(libgap_owned_objects),
       self.libgap_owned_objects_rnam, self.value)

For simplicity we implemented this in Cython, but that should probably
be moved in the C library interface.

5) Memory management: I replaced the sbrk with a malloc'ed workspace.
Added advantage: you can then use valgrind. I think valgrind disallows
large sbrk() calls to force the libc malloc implementation to avoid
it. For now, the libGAP workspace size has to be fixed at
iinitialization. This isn't ideal but Dima thought that you have some
long-term plans for switching to a different garbage collector. Maybe
you can tell us more about that.

6) We didn't hit any name collisions in Sage, so its not an urgent
issue. I agree that eventually only the relevant symbols should be
exported by the shared library but GAP generally uses less common
names. Most C code doesn't use [CamelCase](CamelCase), for starters.

7) I haven't tried loading modules from within libGAP.

8) I didn't encounter any problems with GMP. Sage uses MPIR.

In any case, I'm very interested in getting a library implementation
upstream and can help with that. I'm currently travelling around for
conferences and will be back in DIAS in Dublin for more than a couple
of days starting in August.

Best wishes,
Volker

Is it possible to fix the memory limit for the gap session?

I can send you the whole file with the definition of the classes for G and x0, but i don't think it would give any useful information here: g is just a finitely presented group object of the ligbap interface, and x is one of its generators.

I couldn't reproduce the error.

For ecllib I ended up keeping a doubly linked list, since insertions and deletions are O(1), at the cost of a largish constant in memory overhead.

Alternatives include inserting in the first unbound spot of the list, which has the wrong complexity for object creation unless you keep a free list. You could keep a stack or a deque of free spots. I don't know if a FIFO or LIFO strategy would lead to better opportunities to shorten the reference list.

<a id='comment:97'></a>Ok, done. Comparison works now:

```
sage: libgap('test') == libgap.Concatenation(libgap('te'), libgap('st'))
True
```

I made one incompatible change: since `libgap` is the parent to all gap elements, it should do element construction for strings:

```
sage: libgap('1+1')
"1+1"
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_String'>
```
To evaluate a GAP command in a string, you now have to use

```
sage: libgap.eval('1+1')
2
```
Since we aim at wrapping more of GAP one expects that the `libgap.eval` method becomes less useful over time.

Well, yes 8-/. 

What about eliminating a hardcoded path in `sage/libs/gap/test/main.c` ?
Is it possible to test this, via a Cython wrapper, say? (It's also easier to test this in sage-check script).

I cannot guess the correct value of this relative to `$SAGE_LOCAL` or `$SAGE_ROOT`. In fact it should be easy to have this build and run from Sage shell prompt (i.e. `sage -sh`), then these hardcoded paths in Makefile and in main.c are not necessary. It would be great to have this fixed.

Then hooking it up on sage-check becomes trivial, too.

I don't understand whether MPIR is used as the replacement of GMP here, or not.
(according to spkg-install it looks as if it uses MPIR, actually).

<a id='comment:4'></a>The `sage/libs/gap/test/main.c` is only for instructional purposes, it demonstrates how to build a standalone binary so you can run libGAP under a debugger/valgrind without Sage. It doesn't exercise anything thats not already in doctests. 

One could add a `spkg-check` to test `src/test` in the spkg, but they again don't exercise anything thats not covered by libGAP doctests.

I've removed the upstream-gap-x.y.z directories from the spkg, the `make-spkg.sh` script copied them there accidentally.

Gap links against MPIR just fine, the only issue is with a version check that I reported here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mpir-devel/X48SfwGkSd8/discussion. This is why the `spkg-install` adds `-D__GMP_MP_RELEASE=50002` to the `CFLAGS`:

```

The memory you can use in the gap session is limited to the pool size, but at least on 64-bit this should always be a lot.

I tried it on the system I am testing libgap now, and it doesn't work (I needed to do changes --- see the patch to be attached --- to the source to make it compile, but it seems to need more, as I get suspicious warnings during compilation, and then a segfault)

I don't think there is any reason for statically linking gmp other than their build system predating much of autotools...

The implicit declaration and pointer cast warnings are normal, GAP just predates ansi C :-)

Well, anyhow... Could you confirm that my change of the code was OK, and this is a genuine issue?
gdb tells me the following:

Well, I rebuilt libgap with SAGE_DEBUG on, and I can see it starting the interpreter interaction, parsing the input, calling gasman, then something goes wrong, it tries to print the message `"Variable: 'FreeGroup' must have a value"`

```

(gdb) 
libGAP_SPrTo (buffer=0x7fffffffd0d0 "Variable: 'FreeGroup' must have a value", maxlen=120, 
    format=0x7ffff7750098 "Variable: '%s' must have a value", arg1=140733014557528, arg2=0)
    at scanner.c:3049
```
then I see

```
(gdb) 
libGAP_SyStrncat (dst=0x7fffffffcd20 "justQuit", src=0x7ffff775e32c "justQuit", len=1023)
    at system.c:682

(gdb) 
libGAP_RNamName (name=0x7ffff775e32c "justQuit") at records.c:110
```
and it tries to go further. Eventually I see

```
(gdb) 
libGAP_ErrorQuit (msg=0x7ffff77472a0 "Variable: <<unknown>> must have an assigned value", arg1=0, 
    arg2=0) at gap.c:1451
(gdb) 
libGAP_CallErrorInner (msg=0x7ffff77472a0 "Variable: <<unknown>> must have an assigned value", 
    arg1=0, arg2=0, justQuit=1, mayReturnVoid=0, mayReturnObj=0, lateMessage=0x7ffef510a678, 
    printThisStatement=1) at gap.c:1430

```

this gets repeated many times (buffer corruption), and eventually a segfault.

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff75a8eef in libGAP_RNamName (name=Cannot access memory at address 0x7fffff7fefa8
) at records.c:79
```

the trouble starts of course much earlier, before it fails to recognize `FreeGroup` as a valid GAP function...

`sage.interfaces.interface.Interface` doesn't look like the most useful parent, its non-unique and operates on the assumption that one is dealing with a separate process. Here we have a shared library that is full of global variables. I think libGAP should aim at directly translating Sage<->GAP objects, so that the libGAP user does not have to input gap commands as strings at all.

It wouldn't take much to also build a libtoolized standalone interpreter, or even a GAP interpreter that communicates over zeromq. The problem is that 3rd party packages often expect a stand-alone gap tree with upstream's hacked up semi-autotools to install themselves in. From talking with people in St. Andrews I understand that upstream probably would have switched their build system already if it were not for this legacy problem.

I got rid of the assert abuse and added some more tests.

>  a GAP interpreter that communicates over zeromq


This is a great idea. Would we be able to use IPython as the GAP interpreter if we tied your libGAP to zeromq?

Also based on conversations in St. Andrews, some upstream developers are interested in an autotools based build system. AFAICT, the main problem with compiled GAP packages is that they rely on the object files previously compiled for the GAP executable to find symbols they need from the GAP kernel. libGAP solves this problem. This can be fixed by changing GAP's compiler wrapper which adds the path of these object files to find your libGAP instead. Before trying this approach, a GAP interpreter that uses libGAP is needed. Otherwise we will have the GAP binary and libGAP in memory with the same code.


Volker, many thanks for all the hard work on libGAP.

zeromq is just a transport, you'd have to speak the IPython protocol to do this. Much harder than just tying stdin/stdout/stderr to sockets.

You also need to prefix the symbol names with `libGAP_` if you want to link against libGAP with legacy code. Doable but at least in the short term its much easier to have libGAP and standalone GAP separately. Much like libSingular and Singular.

Do you mean GAP extension packages, things which are compiled using `gac` ?
"Normal" GAP packages do not need any of this, AFAIK.
The extension packages are few and far apart. The only one I know is [EDIM](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/EDIM/index.html).
The main use of `gac` seems to be
to create faster loading GAP executables.

these are calls to random stuff, or so it seems! No wonder different hardware gives different (pseudo?)random elements. If it were tests I'd say they'd be marked `# random`, like

```
         GroupAlgebra(DihedralGroup(6), QQ).random_element() # random

not sure about examples in this case though. Or else, if these random elements are actually predictable, this could be a bug in the pseudorandom source.

But, regardless of the mysterious error, everything seems to work ok (at least my fpgroups code, which is what i am using for testing).

I've rebased the root patch just now, and removed the assert that offended Jeroen a while ago.

The startup error handling will be dealt with at #13588, this ticket is already way too long.

This ticket should be easy to review since it contains only minor changes from the previously-reviewed state.

It is the same computation, but in the gap session it has enough memory (it doesn't need much: even with -o 256M the computation succeeds), and through libgap it runs out of memory.

<a id='comment:143'></a>Replying to [mmarco](#comment%3A142):

Gap does that already. I've described some of the details here:

```
def set_gap_memory_pool_size(size_in_bytes):
    """
    Set the desired gap memory pool size.

    Subsequently started GAP/libGAP instances will use this as
    default. Currently running instances are unchanged.

    GAP will only reserve ``size_in_bytes`` address space. Unless you
    actually start a big GAP computation, the memory will not be
    used. However, corresponding swap space will be reserved so that
    GAP will always be able to use the reserved address space if
    needed. While nothing is actually written to disc as long as you
    don't run a big GAP computation, the reserved swap space will not
    be available for other processes. 
    ...
```

<a id='comment:6'></a>I am starting to work on some project to allow computing reduced forms in some fp groups, and i found that i can't load gap packages via libgap:

```

Also, i don't know if it is because of libgap overwriting something in the usual gap interface, but gap.LoadPackage() gives an error message.

I installed the kbmag package with this .spkg i just made: 
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_B7eBQ-W5NGOFpIMmxiNXZVaGc

Is there something i should take into account?

That's certainly not the best way to host files.
There is http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/
which would make much more sense.

Or, perhaps, even easier, a bitbucket or github account.
