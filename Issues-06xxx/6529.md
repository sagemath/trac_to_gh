Attached patch has functions from ticket #6509 in it as well.  

I deleted the optional argument "k=1" from Euler_Phi, since it didn't seem to be there for any reason.

Good work: patch applies fine, and all doctests pass. But I noticed that several docstrings are mis-formatted, including the one for the new four_squares function. Then I had an attack of enthusiasm and decided to clean all that up. Hence the second patch above.

I'm happy with mhampton's changes; so if mhampton (or anyone someone else) could take a quick look at the second patch, then we can call this a positive review.
