Attached patch has functions from ticket #6509 in it as well.  

I deleted the optional argument "k=1" from Euler_Phi, since it didn't seem to be there for any reason.

I'm happy with mhampton's changes; so if mhampton (or anyone someone else) could take a quick look at the second patch, then we can call this a positive review.
