# Issue 6861: [with patch, positive review] allow users to test Sage script using system-wide Sage installation

At least in Sage 4.1.1, a regular user cannot run tests on their own Sage scripts using a system-wide installation of Sage. Doing so would result in a permission error:

```
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ cat demo.sage 
print 2
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ sage -t demo.sage 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/bin/sage-test", line 49, in <module>
    os.makedirs(TMP)
  File "/usr/local/sage/local/lib/python/os.py", line 157, in makedirs
    mkdir(name, mode)
OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/sage/tmp/tmp'
```
That is due to the testing script writing temporary data to a temporary directory under the system-wide Sage installation. A work around is to have one's own local installation of Sage under one's home directory. But it would be nice if the test script would write temporary data to the user's `DOT_SAGE` directory, i.e. `$HOME/.sage`. This problem was reported at this [sage-support](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/af6d95445f76cbe9) thread.

It seems to me that if (because of the changed definition of `SAGE_TESTDIR`) the directory `~/.sage/tmp` is to be used for testing system files, then logically it should also be used for testing users' own files.  This requires a few more changes.    

It also seems worthwhile to active the function `delete_tmpfiles` in `sage-doctest`; at present this function does nothing.  The obvious things is for it to get called if the doctest succeeds without any failures, but at present the method of counting the number of failures is defective.

I have implemented these ideas and am testing the code.  A patch will follow soon.
