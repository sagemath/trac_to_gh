New Features:

```
- Extended weight lattice/space for affine types
- coxeter_matrix and coxeter_diagram (for crystallographic types)
- Embeddings of the root lattice/space in root lattice realizations
- Embeddings of the weight lattice/space in weight lattice realizations
- Partial conversion from the root space to the root lattice
- Iterator for any Coxeter group, and weak order ideals thereof
- Facade option for weak_poset's and bruhat_poset's of finite coxeter groups
- weak_poset's of finite coxeter groups are lattices; added link weak_lattice -> weak_poset
  (courtesy of Christian Stump)
- Enumerated set for grassmannian elements, and is_grasmmannian test
- Added method register_as_conversion to morphisms
```

Refactoring:

```
- RootLatticeRealization and WeightLatticeRealization are now categories
- Use abstract_methods where appropriate
- Cleanup of an_element
- to_coroot_lattice_morphism: renamed to to_coroot_lattice_space, and
  moved from RootLatticeRealization to RootSpace (it does not make
  sense for, e.g., the weight lattice).
- Moved the implementation of associated_coroot in root_lattice_realization to root_space where it belongs
```

Doc, tests and bug fixes:

```
- 100% doctests on sage.combinat.root_system, except for weyl_group and weyl_characters
- 100% doctests on CoxeterGroups
- Add most modules in sage.combinat.root_system to the reference manual and improved the quickref
- Misc doc fixes in the above modules
- Add minimal documentation to AffineWeylGroups
- Added systematic tests for associated_coroot
- Fixed further missing features revealed by this test:
  - reducible Cartan types were not seen as finite/simply laced/crystallographic as appropriate
  - symmetrizer needed to be generalized to reducible cartan types (including D2)
  - the relabelling for reducible cartan types was broken for affine types
- More tests for scalar products
- Added systematic consistency check between the simple_root and simple_roots methods
- same thing for fundamental_weight and fundamental_weights
- Fixed a SL vs GL glitch when obtaining simple roots for reducible cartan types revealed by the above
- Fixed imports (extraneous ones, and a missing one reported by M. Shimozono and others)
```

I fixed the doctests failures due to this patch. Most of them where due to the fact that affine weyl groups are iterable now, which gives a nicer an_element on any free module thereupon.

The other doctests failures showing up in the log are related to #12518 (or to the ISGCI patch, but that's because I did not upload the appropriate database on my test server).

The review can start!

Hi Nicolas,

Impressive patch! Thanks for working on this.
Here are some first comments:

- In /sage/categories/affine_weyl_groups.py there is a new import
from sage.categories.infinite_enumerated_sets import InfiniteEnumeratedSets
which is not used. Please either remove this line or add InfiniteEnumeratedSets
in the class (which is probably preferable).

- In /sage/categories/affine_weyl_groups.py please add a `TestSuite(s).run()` doctest.

- I am not sure this is related to the patch, but there are some
strange methods in /sage/categories/coxeter_groups.py without doctests:

        `@`abstract_method(optional = True)
        def has_right_descent(self, i):
            """
            Returns whether i is a right descent of self.

#            EXAMPLES::
#
#                sage:
            """

        def has_left_descent(self, i):
            """
            Returns whether `i` is a left descent of self.

            This default implementation uses that a left descent of
            `w` is a right descent of `w^{-1}`.
            """
            return (~self).has_right_descent(i)

Should has_left_descent also be an abstract_method? Or is that implicit through
has_right_descent?

- Why is the cateogry RootLatticeRealization in
/sage/combinat/root_system/root_lattice_realization.py
here and not in categories (if it is a category as specified in the docstring)?

The same question holds for WeightLatticeRealizations(Category_over_base_ring)
in /sage/combinat/root_system/weight_lattice_realization.py.

- When using the extended weight lattice, the list of fundamental weights
does not include `\delta`. On the other hand it is possible to input
`\delta` into the method fundamental_weight. This seems a little inconsistent.

```
    sage: Q = RootSystem(['A', 3, 1]).weight_lattice(extended = True); Q
    Extended weight lattice of the Root system of type ['A', 3, 1]
    sage: Q.fundamental_weights()
    Finite family {0: Lambda[0], 1: Lambda[1], 2: Lambda[2], 3: Lambda[3]}
    sage: Q.fundamental_weight('delta')
    delta
```

Also, I posted a first reviewer's patch on sage-combinat with mostly just
trivial changes. Please fold it if you are satisfied.

Thanks!

Anne

There is a default implementation for this method, so it's not abstract. Indeed, it would be nice to track such dependencies in the documentation; but we don't have the infrastructure for that.

Yeah, we had a similar discussion for the crystal categories and the
categories for Symmetric Functions and friends. And there is a non
trivial borderline to set.

On one hand, we have general categories (like Groups, Algebras, ...)
which are likely to get used in several Sage modules.  Also, they name
a well-known area of mathematics; so it's natural to import them by
default in the interpreter, if not just as an entry point.

On the other hand we have categories that are rather specific to a
Sage module, if not just implementation details. So it's good to keep
them in this module, in particular to be as close as close as possible
from the other sources of that module.

CoxeterGroups clearly fits the first case (most mathematicians have
heard of them; this category is used by WeylGroup (in
sage.combinat.root_system) and by SymmetricGroup (in sage.groups).

The categories for symmetric functions are basically implementation
details and fits in the second case. Anyway, SymmetricFunctions is
already a good entry point.

Crystals are only implemented in sage.combinat.crystals (so far). But
this names an area of mathematics. So this fits a bit more the first
case.

RootLatticeRealizations and WeightLatticeRealizations seem rather
specific. So this fits a bit more the second case.

Yeah, this abuse is documented in "fundamental_weight". Basically, we
need a function that describes the embedding of the basis elements of
the (extended) weight lattice. That's almost what fundamental_weight
does, and I did not have a good alternative name. So I abused
fundamental_weight to do just a bit more that its natural job.
Anyway, we currently only have a single implementation of
WeightLatticeRealizations in the affine case, so it's very localized,
and easy to change in the future if we come up with a good name
(unless you have one!).

Let me know if you are ok with the above and with my reviewer's patch.
If yes, I'll fold the patches, reindent properly
root_lattice_realization.py and weight_lattice_realization.py, and add
a 's' at the end of those files (I haven't done those yet to keep the
diff meaningful). Then, the patch will be good to go.

For the record, all tests pass on Sage 5.0 beta6, with the following
patches applied:

```
trac_10817-generalized_associahedra-cs.patch
trac_12645-fix_rst_markup-sk.patch

No, there is a lot of crystal code in /sage/categories: crystals, finite_crystals, highest_weight_crystals, ....

Why can't fundamental_weights when "extended" is set also include `delta`? This would at least fit with the notational abuse of fundamental_weight.

I meant: the crystals themselves (CrystalOfLetter, KR, ...) are all in
implemented in sage.combinat.crystals.

Because we want to do things like:

    sage: x in self.fundamental_weights()
    
    sage: all(L.some_property() for L in self.fundamental_weights())

So adding delta would change the semantic of fundamental_weights.
Whereas the current abuse of fundamental_weight can't break any code.

But these are not categories, they are classes. In your case, a cateogory is in
/sage/combinat/root_systems/

How about self.fundamental_weights(extended = True) with default extended = False?

Yes: unlike for crystals, and like for symmetric functions (well for
NCSF actually; the categorification of symmetric functions is yet to
be done), I want to keep the categories close to the classes. As I
said, it's borderline, but it feels better to me this way.

> How about self.fundamental_weights(extended = True) with default extended = False?


Well, since it's an abuse, and one that we might want to get rid of,
I'd rather not abuse yet another function. Unless you have a natural
use case for this notation? (for the extended weight lattice, that's
just self.basis()).

> Sorry, I forgot to push.


Given how many times I played that gag to you, I am not going
to throw the first rock :-)

> It should be there now.


Yes, thanks! I have folded together all patches and posted them
here. I also did the reindentation and renaming *_lattice_realization
-> *_lattice_realizations. On my side, the patch is good to go.

Cheers,
                        Nicolas

Good catches. Thanks! Folded.

I allowed myself to further add the weight lattice realizations file to the reference manual, and to replace {\vee} by \vee. I also set back \mathbb{N} to \NN, since \NN will be added very soon to the standard Sage macros.

Hi Anne:

Replying to [aschilling](#comment%3A34):
> I am not sure why you replaced \mathcal{N} by \NN since this currently gives a latex error when compiling the documentation:


As I said: ``I also set back \mathbb{N} to \NN, since \NN will be added very soon to the standard Sage macros''

There are lots of other failures like this in the documentation; it's best to progressively get rid of them, but here it's just temporary, so that's good enough. Let's not waste time on having to update this later.

Cheers,
                           Nicolas
