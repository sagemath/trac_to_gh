GiNaC doesn't do this either:

```
> exp(x)*exp(2*x);
exp(2*x)*exp(x)
```

I'll try to play with the mul::eval method in pynac to do this. The main problem is doing it without compromising speed.

Cheers,

Burcin

New pynac package here fixes the exp simplification:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.8.spkg

Attached patches fix doctests, and change module_list.py to rebuild the sage/symbolic/* modules if the package is updated.

This package also contains a fix for #6163, so these tickets should be merged together.
