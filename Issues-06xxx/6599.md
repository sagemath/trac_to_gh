sage: hmm.GaussianMixtureHiddenMarkovModel(A, B, pi)

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

Note that a long time ago we stupidly turned off doctesting of HMM's so that tests would pass on itanium.  We were lazy and never turned them back on, which is why this never got caught before.
