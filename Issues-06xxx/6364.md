Reported on sage-devel:

```
All seemed well with that test (all tests passed, etc), but the final
lines of output are

All tests passed! Popping patches from queue ...
cd "/home/jec/sage-4.0.2/devel/sage" && hg qpop -a
cd "/home/jec/sage-4.0.2/devel/sage" && hg qdelete trac_5307.patch
Building failed with SystemExit: 0

-- what's with the "failed" in the last line?
```

Craig suggested:

```
Interesting ... I've never seen that before. What os/arch are you on?
Could I ask you to try one thing: go to $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin, and edit
sage-apply-ticket. On the 5th line from the bottom is "sys.exit(0)" --
could you try deleting that line and moving it to the very bottom (and
outdenting it)? I suspect that error will go away. Actually, you could
even try just deleting that line, and I suspect that will fix it, too.
```
and was right:

```
That did the trick -- ran fine and no "failure" line at the end.  (I
moved that line to the end as suggested)
```

Craig's patch would not work for me, it failed to apply, perhaps because the script has changed in the interim.

I have added a new patch and hope it can be reviewed before things  change again!
