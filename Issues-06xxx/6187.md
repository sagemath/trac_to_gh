Currently, `sage -clone` requires a rebuild of the Sage documentation.  This ticket attempts to fix this and a few related problems with the "docbuild" system.  It also includes some features added in the course of fixing the problems:

* Lots of new command-line options. For a list and examples, try, e.g., `sage -docbuild -H`.  The old options and syntax should still work.

* Progress updates with Python's powerful logging framework, which we may wish to adopt later for the Sage library.

The only patches to apply are

This adds a test document similar to the reference manual.  It covers only algebras, so it builds much more quickly and may facilitate experimentation with Sphinx, say.  To build it, try `sage -docbuild testreference html -jv3`.

I think the file modification times need to be copied over as well with a "cp -a" instead of "cp -r".  I'm not sure if there are any hardcoded paths in the Sphinx environment pickle that would need to be changed.

I'm not having any luck with this.

No matter what, if after cloning, I delete the directory doc/output and then recopy it, `sage -docbuild reference html` rebuilds everything.

This is kind of brutal, but we can replace the cloning part of sage-clone with a single line like

```
cmd = 'cp -pr sage %s'%branch
```
(This is with the BSD version of cp on Mac OS X; it might be more portable to use a python equivalent, like shutil.copytree.)

This has the disadvantage that some crap gets copied along with the good stuff. This is probably a bad idea from other points of view, too; what else goes wrong?  

It has the advantage that modification times are preserved, while they are not (as far as I can tell) when you use 'hg clone' to copy the repository.

By the way, the 'clone' section of the hg man page says:

```
In some cases, you can clone repositories and checked out files
using full hardlinks with
$ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE
This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The
operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your editor
breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so). Also,
this is not compatible with certain extensions that place their
metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.
```
This is where I got the idea, although their version creates hard links, which I suppose is why it would be "the fastest way"...

One issue to keep in mind when testing: if you do

```
sage -docbuild --jsmath reference html
```
as is done at the end of 'make', and then you do

```
sage -docbuild reference html
```
the entire reference manual gets rebuilt (and similarly for the other pieces of documentation).  So if you're testing out an idea for how to fix this, make sure that you're consistent with the `--jsmath` setting before and after cloning.

> I noticed an error occurs during cloning if `environment.pickle` doesn't already exist.

The new patch should now work in this case.

The pickle's `srcdir` attribute contains what appears to be the only trace of the name of the cloned (i.e., previous) branch.  This can become an issue when branches are renamed or deleted, as Sphinx will throw an OSError.  The new patch now tells Sphinx to use the sym-linked '.../devel/sage/...'

> I'll try to make a new patch for `builder.py,` after I build 4.1.alpha2.

Apply [trac_6187_new_scripts.patch] to the scripts repository and [trac_6187_mpatel_v2.patch] to the sage repository.

Attachment: **[trac_6187_builder_v4.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6187/trac_6187_builder_v4.patch.gz)**

Apply only the v4 pair to the appropriate repositories.  The `testreference` patch just adds a non-trivial test document that should build quickly.  It may give an indication, at least, of the behavior to expect when building the full reference manual.

Changes in v4:
* Reordering of some code and somewhat better case / exception handling in the reference builder.
* First steps with Python's [logging](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) framework.  It's powerful and easy to use, at least inside one module.  One of Sphinx's utility modules colorizes some of the output.
* More aggressive use of Python's [optparse](http://docs.python.org/library/optparse.html) module, in order to provide several new command-line options (cf. #6488).  The previous syntax should still work, however.
* `sage-clone` should now be compatible with #6512. `--update_mtimes` is now `--update-mtimes`.

I've focused on the reference manual, but I hope the new pieces make it easier to improve the docbuild system for the other documents, too.  Feel free to make constructive comments, as well as changes.  In particular, we should settle on the option names.

Overall, this works as advertised.  I like the new options, the new option parsing, and the help messages.  We might consider eventually updating mtimes on all of the docs, not just the reference manual, but everything else is quick enoug to build that it's not a big deal.

Someone else should take a good look at it, though, since I am an author of part of this (the scripts part).  Also, there are a number of changes to builder.py, and other people should look carefully at them, more carefully than I have so far.

Other comments: if I do something like `sage -docbuild hello html`, then it says

```
sphinx-build -b html -d /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/doctrees/en/hello    /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/en/hello /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/hello
Error: Source directory doesn't contain conf.py file.
Build finished.  The built documents can be found in /Applications/sage/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/hello
```
The problem is, it creates a directory SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/hello, and now "hello" appears in the list of documents.  Should there be better error checking to prevent this from happening?

Actually, I think this belongs on another ticket: it's a "pre-existing condition", and can be dealt with separately.  See #6605.
