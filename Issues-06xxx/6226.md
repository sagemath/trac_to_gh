Comments: very nice overall.  I have a second patch, to be applied on top of yours, which deals with a few small issues:

in producing_patches.rst, `hg_sage.patch(...)` and `hg_sage.apply(...)` are not synonyms, and it sounds like that a bit.  Also, you've deleted one reference to the "doc" repository, but there's another (two lines after "Sage includes these Mercuruial repositories").

in sage_manuals.rst: as far as I can tell, you don't need to run `sage -b` when producing new versions of any manual other than the reference manual: just edit the files and run `sage -docbuild tutorial html` or whatever.  There are a few typos, too.

in trac.rst: I thought that a few of the lines from the wiki were more appropriate for a wiki page than a formal piece of documentation, so I removed them.

I give your patch a positive review, so if you're happy with mine, the whole thing is ready to go.
