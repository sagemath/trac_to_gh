We need to add to the developer's guide some information about docstring formatting in ReST, and how to build the Sage standard documentation. The developer's guide also needs to document further detailed guidelines when working on tickets.

Comments: very nice overall.  I have a second patch, to be applied on top of yours, which deals with a few small issues:

in producing_patches.rst, `hg_sage.patch(...)` and `hg_sage.apply(...)` are not synonyms, and it sounds like that a bit.  Also, you've deleted one reference to the "doc" repository, but there's another (two lines after "Sage includes these Mercuruial repositories").

in sage_manuals.rst: as far as I can tell, you don't need to run `sage -b` when producing new versions of any manual other than the reference manual: just edit the files and run `sage -docbuild tutorial html` or whatever.  There are a few typos, too.

in trac.rst: I thought that a few of the lines from the wiki were more appropriate for a wiki page than a formal piece of documentation, so I removed them.

I give your patch a positive review, so if you're happy with mine, the whole thing is ready to go.
