Try this:

1. Start the sage notebook and go to this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/games/sudoku.html
```
You can do that, e.g, by just clicking on Help, Reference Manual, etc.

2. Try to search for anything, e.g, integer.  

3. It doesn't work at all. 



I consider this a pretty serious bug.  Some ideas:

* make the search box actually bring up the static docs instead, where search *DOES* work

* disable search in the live docs.

* fix the real problem so search works in the live docs as it should.

Any of the above would be way way better than the current situation.

I don't see the search box on that page anymore.  However, if you go to the table of contents, there is a search page listed (for example, at /doc/live/tutorial/index.html).  Clicking on the link to the search page gives the error:

Please activate JavaScript to enable the search functionality. 

Of course, javascript is already enabled.
