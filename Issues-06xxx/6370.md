Try this:

1. Start the sage notebook and go to this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/games/sudoku.html
```
You can do that, e.g, by just clicking on Help, Reference Manual, etc.

2. Try to search for anything, e.g, integer.  

3. It doesn't work at all. 



I consider this a pretty serious bug.  Some ideas:

* make the search box actually bring up the static docs instead, where search *DOES* work

* disable search in the live docs.

* fix the real problem so search works in the live docs as it should.

Any of the above would be way way better than the current situation.
