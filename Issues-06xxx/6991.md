```
In the nfacets method, for non-reflexive lattice polytopes this is computed from:

```
self._nfacets = len(self._facet_normals)
```
but self._facet_normals is a matrix, which does not have a len method.  So I think this should instead be

```
self._nfacets = self._facet_normals.nrows()
```

A doctest should also be added for this case.
