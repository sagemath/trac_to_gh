Many spkg's have tons of `._` files in them since the spkg's were made on OS X.  To fix this we just have to set two environment variables. 

```
Marshall Hampton notes the following:

Helpful post on avoiding this:

http://norman.walsh.name/2008/02/22/tar

...upshot is that one should add

export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true

to your profile if using leopard, or

COPY_EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTES_DISABLE=true

if using tiger or previous stuff (I don't think many sage developers
are using something pre-tiger at this point though).
```

Huh, this is cool!  Although Jeroen and other release managers have been pretty good about marking such spkgs 'needs work' lately, does anyone know if this is still valid?

As far as I know, all the instances of `.DS_Store` files currently in Sage actually come from upstream packages. So adding these environment variables wouldn't make a difference.
