Many spkg's have tons of `._` files in them since the spkg's were made on OS X.  To fix this we just have to set two environment variables. 

```
Marshall Hampton notes the following:

Helpful post on avoiding this:

http://norman.walsh.name/2008/02/22/tar

...upshot is that one should add

export COPYFILE_DISABLE=true

to your profile if using leopard, or

COPY_EXTENDED_ATTRIBUTES_DISABLE=true

if using tiger or previous stuff (I don't think many sage developers
are using something pre-tiger at this point though).

As far as I know, all the instances of `.DS_Store` files currently in Sage actually come from upstream packages. So adding these environment variables wouldn't make a difference.
