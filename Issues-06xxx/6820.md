The attached patch introduces the command `browse_sage_doc`.  It lets you do the following from either the command-line or the notebook:

```
browse_sage_doc.tutorial()   # open the tutorial in a browser window
browse_sage_doc.reference()
browse_sage_doc.developer()
browse_sage_doc.constructions()
```
and also

```
browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix)
```
opens up the docstring for `identity_matrix` in a browser window.  It doesn't look very pretty, but it's legible.  You can also do

```
browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix, output='rst')
```
to output (as a string) the reST version of the docstring, and

```
browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix, view=False)
```
to output (as a string) the html version of the docstring.

New: following cremona's suggestion, this also adds the following top-level commands:

```
tutorial()
reference()
manual()  # synonym for "reference"
developer()
constructions()
```
These open the corresponding document.  The new command `python_help` does what the old command `help` did.  The new command help does the following: with an argument, it acts like the old help -- that is, it calls `python_help(arg)`.  With no argument, it prints this message:

```
Welcome to Sage %s!  To view the Sage tutorial in your web browser,
type 'tutorial()', and to view the (very detailed) Sage reference
manual, type 'manual()'.  For help on any Sage function, for example
'matrix_plot', type 'matrix_plot?' to see a help message, type
'help(matrix_plot)' to see a very similar message, type
'browse_sage_doc(matrix_plot)' to view a message in a web browser, and
type 'matrix_plot??' to look at the function's source code.

To enter Python's interactive online help utility, type 'python_help()'.
To get help on a Python function, module or package, type 'help(MODULE)' or
'python_help(MODULE)'.
```
(with the "%s" in the first line replaced by the version number).

Sphinx 0.5.1 throws a strange exception in `Cell.set_introspect_html()`.  I set `verbose=True` and replaced `sphinx_app.build(None, [rst_name])` with

```
                try:
                    sphinx_app.build(None, [rst_name])
                except Exception as exc:
                    print exc
```
Following `sage -br`:

The lock file remains in the doc cache directory.  This may be peculiar to my current setup, but I can't investigate further right now.

Also, by default `set_introspect_html()` tries to delete the reST file.

Should we delete leftover .lock files on startup?

I think this is a great facility.  Just being able to pop up the 4 main docs so easily is worth including this!

When I tried  browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix) and the like, I found that the first time I did it I got that error:

I'm not sure how useful the output='rst' or the view=False options are though.

On some platforms, this seems to depend on using Sphinx 0.6.2 instead of the version installed with Sage, 0.5.1.  Can you try the spkg at #6586 to see if that helps?  (Use the one listed in [the most recent comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6586#comment:33).)

Me neither, but this was in response to [a discussion on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/fb5f4b2affb89edc/a5d0cdd440aa83fb?tvc=2&q=6820#), in which the ability to see raw rst or raw html was viewed as potentially useful.

I tried this again after installing the new sphinx from #6586, and the problem I reported earlier has gone away.

So I'm giving this s positive review (noting that it should depend on #6586).

Just one thought -- new users might not think of typing "browse_sage_doc", so it might be helpful to include top-level commands tutorial(), manual() [for the reference manual], at least.  Currently help() starts up the python help system which is not so useful in sage, and I would even suggest considering over-writing that with s basic sage help (which would probably just output a brief suggestion to try manual() or tutorial()).

Here's a new patch.  This uses "sphinxify" from sagenb, which is good.

Following cremona's suggestion above, it also adds top level commands: tutorial, manual, developer, constructions, each of which opens up the named document in a web browser.  Furthermore, it redefines "help" so that it prints a short help message:

```
Welcome to Sage 4.2!  To view the Sage tutorial in your web browser,
type 'tutorial()', and to view the (very detailed) Sage reference manual,
type 'manual()'.  For help on any function, for example 'matrix_plot', type
'matrix_plot?' to see display a help message, type 'browse_sage_doc(matrix_plot)'
to view the same message in a web browser, and type 'matrix_plot??' to look
at the function's source code.

To use Python's online help utility, type 'python_help()'.
```
As you can see from this message, the old function "help" is now called "python_help".

Version 3:

* Uses Sphinx's stylesheet and jsMath to format individual docstrings nicely.  Try `browse_sage_doc(identity_matrix)`.
* *May* require upgrading [jsMath to version 3.6c](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/changes.html), because of Firefox's 3.5's same-origin policy for local files.
* Guesses the `obj`'s name.  See [this](http://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread229813.html), [this](http://pythonic.pocoo.org/2009/5/30/finding-objects-names), and/or [this](http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/19521-gathering-variable-names-within-function).

Problems:

* Math does **not** render properly because backslashes are stripped, somewhere.
* It may be better to use a HTML template instead of an inline triple-quoted string.
