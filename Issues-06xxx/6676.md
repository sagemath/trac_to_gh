When I start Sage on Solaris, as soon as I type notebook(), I get a 'DeprecationWarning'. It does not give a good impression to get this after the running the first command one is likely to want to run. It says 'the md5 module is deprecated; use hashlib instead'.

Hence I suggest this is fixed asap, as its going to be the first impression someone gets of Sage.
