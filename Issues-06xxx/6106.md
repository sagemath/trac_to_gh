Review

The patch applied fine to 4.0.1, and it provides some functions which look useful.

I think that not all new new functions have doctests.  Why are the new functions not implemented as member functions of the BinaryQF class?  That would be much better;  as it is anyone using them has to import them explicitly.  So I suggest that they are converted to be member functions (which is trivial to do).

Secondly, the use of the python math functions sqrt and floor is not a good idea, since the coefficients of the form will be Sage integers.  For example:

```
sage: from sage.quadratic_forms.binary_qf import normalized_indefinite_form
sage: f = BinaryQF([10^100,10^500,10^200])
sage: f.discriminant()>0
True
sage: normalized_indefinite_form(f)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/john/.sage/temp/ubuntu/9768/_home_john__sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()

/home/john/sage-4.0.1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/quadratic_forms/binary_qf.pyc in normalized_indefinite_form(f)
    486         raise ValueError, "This only works for indefinite forms"
    487     
--> 488     if sqrt(delta) <= abs(a):
    489         s=(a/abs(a))*floor(-1*b/(2*abs(a)))
    490     else:

OverflowError: math range error
```
For example, the line if sqrt(delta) <= abs(a): could be replaced by if delta <= a**2: .

The docstring for this function should also say what the definition of "normalised" is.

I also slightly amended the ticket's title to give a better description.

If I recall correctly the reduction of an indefinite form is not unique but instead we get a cycle of forms. So we can add some doctests. But the results may be different.

Note that we messed up a little for indefinite forms of square determinant #25861.
