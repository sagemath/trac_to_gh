Take a binary distribution of Sage, uncompress it, and start up Sage for the first time. You should see something similar to the following in your terminal:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.rc1-x86_64-Linux]$ ./sage 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The SAGE install tree may have moved.
Regenerating Python.pyo and .pyc files that hardcode the install PATH (please wait at
most a few minutes)...
Do not interrupt this.
```
The message line starting with "Regenerating Python.pyo..." overflows the standard terminal width, which is 80 characters. And the name "SAGE" should be changed to "Sage". This is no big deal, I know, but it occasional annoys me, especially the said long message line.
