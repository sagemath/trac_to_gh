John Cremona reports:

In 4.0.alpha0, this causes a segmentation fault:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.0.alpha0, Release Date: 2009-05-15                  |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-x+22)
sage: w=-13*a-14
sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,-1728*w])
sage: P1 = E.lift_x(-3*a-66)
sage: P2 = E.lift_x((-21*a-93)/4)
sage: P2.division_points(19)
```

It works fine to do

```
sage: g = P2.division_points(19, poly_only=True)
```
which defines a polynomial of degree 361 over Q(sqrt(-87)), but then
g.roots() goes Boom.

ncalexan verified this on Mac OS X; it looks like the crash is in an NTL function:

```
(gdb) bt
#0  0x01293247 in modii ()
#1  0x014278bc in FpX_red ()
```

Nick, do you know what the roots function is actually doing in this case (univariate poly over a number field)?  I think it is calling factor(), but NTL has no support for polynomials over number fields so I thought it must be calling pari after that.

I recently ran into a similar problem trying to factor over the field generated by the hilbert class polynomial over QQ. For small degree (< 50 or so) it's okay but for larger degree polynomials it gives a segmentation fault with PARI. If there's a way I can help here and get a patch up for this I want to know about it!

That in addition to the fact that the code for factoring a univariate polynomial over a number field appears to essentially consist of "make PARI do it" is why it appeared that PARI was causing the SegFault.

In 4.6.alpha1:

```

sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-x+22)
sage: sage: w=-13*a-14
sage: sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,-1728*w])
sage: sage: P1 = E.lift_x(-3*a-66)
sage: sage: P2 = E.lift_x((-21*a-93)/4)
sage: sage: P2.division_points(19)
[]
sage: g = P2.division_points(19, poly_only=True)
sage: g.roots()
[]
```
so this can be closed as fixed.
