John Cremona reports:

In 4.0.alpha0, this causes a segmentation fault:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2-x+22)
sage: w=-13*a-14
sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,-1728*w])
sage: P1 = E.lift_x(-3*a-66)
sage: P2 = E.lift_x((-21*a-93)/4)
sage: P2.division_points(19)
```
| Sage Version 4.0.alpha0, Release Date: 2009-05-15                  |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
It works fine to do

```
sage: g = P2.division_points(19, poly_only=True)
```
which defines a polynomial of degree 361 over Q(sqrt(-87)), but then
g.roots() goes Boom.

ncalexan verified this on Mac OS X; it looks like the crash is in an NTL function:

```
(gdb) bt
#0  0x01293247 in modii ()
#1  0x014278bc in FpX_red ()
```

Nick, do you know what the roots function is actually doing in this case (univariate poly over a number field)?  I think it is calling factor(), but NTL has no support for polynomials over number fields so I thought it must be calling pari after that.

I recently ran into a similar problem trying to factor over the field generated by the hilbert class polynomial over QQ. For small degree (< 50 or so) it's okay but for larger degree polynomials it gives a segmentation fault with PARI. If there's a way I can help here and get a patch up for this I want to know about it!

If we can come up with an example which fails in gp then it would be easy to send a bug report to the pari developers.  It is harder if we can only get the error using the pari library, since then they might want a C program in the report.  I think (quite reasonably) that the pari developers cannot be expected to debug things which can only be demonstrated in a Sage run -- even if the use of pari in Sage has increased the number of pari users worldwide by a lot!

That in addition to the fact that the code for factoring a univariate polynomial over a number field appears to essentially consist of "make PARI do it" is why it appeared that PARI was causing the SegFault.

Would it be possible to call factornf through gp and pull the factorization back to sage?
