```

`psi()` is defined in GiNaC, but we don't provide wrappers for it.

Defining a function `psi`, similar to the way `arctan2` is defined in line 422 of `sage/functions/trig.py` should fix this.

The unrebased patch is fine; I can't get the other patches in the symbolics queue to work off of the rebase, not yet anyway.

If there is time, would it be possible to make an alias polygamma = psi2?  Not just because Mma uses it, but because a lot of references call it that (such as the ones a students of mine is using for some research) in written form.  This is great functionality to add, though.
