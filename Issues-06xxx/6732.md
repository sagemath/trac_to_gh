Nice catch. Can you please open a ticket for that? Here's a relevant snippet from the file `sage/server/notebook/notebook.py`:

```
try:
    dir = self.__absdir
except AttributeErrro:
    dir = self.__dir
import shutil
# We ignore_errors because in rare parallel doctesting                  
# situations sometimes the directory gets cleaned up too                
# quickly, etc.                                                         
shutil.rmtree(dir, ignore_errors=True)
```

Note: I haven't checked that these are the only spelling errors.

I think the "winner" here is `fludded`.

> Note: I haven't checked that these are the only spelling errors.

Given that I spell-checked all the modules in the Sage library in 3 days, I mostly used a spell checker (in particular, aspell) to do most of the hard work. Occasionally I did read some snippets from library files. The time constraint did not allow me to actually read through all the library files. That would catch many more typos, but would also require substantially more time than what has been allocated for the current release. The release of Sage 4.1.1 has been delayed for far too long now. Originally it was planned to be released on the 01st August 2009, but it has dragged on for over a week now, in part due to #6645 and some unexpected issues that needed to be sorted out.
