sage: QQbar(5).is_square()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

...

AttributeError: 'AlgebraicNumber' object has no attribute 'is_square'
```

but of course:

```
sage: QQbar(5).sqrt()
2.236067977499790?
```
