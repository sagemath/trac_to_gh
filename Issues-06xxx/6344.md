attachment:trac_6344-mma_style_attempt.patch implements an approximation to MMA style. It is just for testing, needs much more work for inclusion.

It doesn't look good in text only mode:

```
sage: f = function('f')
sage: f(x).derivative(x,3)
f^{(3)}(x)
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I uploaded a new patch at attachment:trac_6344-symbolic_derivative_print.patch.

The new patch keeps the text mode printing similar to the old one, but changes the printed parameters to indicate how many times each argument is differentiated. E.g., old output:

```
sage: var('x,y')
sage: f = function('f')
sage: f(x).derivative(x)
D[0](f)(x)
sage: f(x,x).derivative(x,2)
D[0, 0](f)(x, x) + 2*D[0, 1](f)(x, x) + D[1, 1](f)(x, x)
```

New output:

```
sage: f(x).derivative(x)
D[1](f)(x)
sage: f(x,x).derivative(x,2)
D[2, 0](f)(x, x) + 2*D[1, 1](f)(x, x) + D[0, 2](f)(x, x)
```

New latex output:

```
sage: latex(f(x).derivative(x))
f'\left(x\right)
sage: latex(f(x,x).derivative(x,2))
f^{(2,0)}\left(x, x\right) + 2 \, f^{(1,1)}\left(x, x\right) + f^{(0,2)}\left(x, x\right)
```

It would be better to add more documentation to explain the output, provide conversions to "textbook style" and fix other problems that pop up when printing derivatives:

```
sage: binomial(x,y).derivative(x)
<boom>
sage: latex(floor(x).derivative(x))
D[0]\left \lfloor x \right \rfloor
sage: latex(ceil(x).derivative(x))
D[0]\left \lceil x \right \rceil
```

However, I think we should settle on an output style ASAP, without letting too many releases go by.

Jason, Minh, can one (or both) of you review this?

<a id='comment:13'></a>I tried to apply the most recent patch, but did not succeed. It is just too old and when looking at the diff I couldn't make any sense of it. I tried to implement differential notation myself, but got stuck, perhaps someone can help?

All I wanted to do is to change the _latex_ representation of the FDerivativeOperator and added the following lines to src/sage/symbolic/operators.py:


```
def _latex_(self):
        """
            Return the LaTeX representation of X.

            EXAMPLES::

            sage: from sage.symbolic.operators import FDerivativeOperator
            sage: var('x z')
            sage: f = function('f', x, z)
            sage: op = FDerivativeOperator(f, [0,1]); latex(op)
            \frac{\partial \frac{\partial f }{\partial x } }{\partial z }
        """
        fname = self._f.operator()
        vars = self._f.operands()
        difvars = self._parameter_set
        str1 = str(fname)
        for difvar in difvars:
            str1 = '\\frac{\partial '+str1+'}{\partial '+str(vars[difvar])+'}'
        return str1
```
Unfortunately, this does not have any effect on the latex representation of f.diff:

```
sage: f = function('f', x, z)
sage: g = diff(f, x,z)
sage: latex(g)
D[0, 1]\left(f\right)\left(x, z\right)
```

Does anyone have an idea what else I need to modify? Thanks in advance!

For symbolic expressions. `self._latex_` invokes `SR._latex_element_` which calls straight into Pynac via ` GEx_to_str_latex(&x._gobj)`. Your experiment shows that this doesn't dispatch to `_latex_` methods on operators.

Looks like the wrong place to hook into this. For symbolic expressions. `self._latex_` invokes `SR._latex_element_` which calls straight into Pynac via ` GEx_to_str_latex(&x._gobj)`. Your experiment shows that this doesn't dispatch to `_latex_` methods on operators. Perhaps there's another hook?

Incidentally, your code wouldn't work, because that's not how FDerivateOperators occur in code:

```
sage: var("x,y")
(x, y)
sage: function('f',x,y)
f(x, y)
sage: g=diff(f(x,y),x,y)
sage: g
D[0, 1](f)(x, y)
sage: g.operator()
D[0, 1](f)
sage: type(g.operator())
<class 'sage.symbolic.operators.FDerivativeOperator'>
sage: g.operator()._f
f
```
As you can see, there are no variable names to refer to. That's why this ticket has stalled: if you want to do this, you need to recognize on the level of `g` that the operator is an `FDerivativeOperator` and hence that, if the operands of `g` are distinct, simple symbolic variables, that the derivative could be written in Leibnitz notation.

Clearly, people haven't found the effort required worth the payoff.
