It would be nice to be able to factor rational functions. The implementation is trivial, and the enclosed patch tries to do that.

REFEREE REPORT



The patch `12063.patch` looks good. The new method `factor()` works over `ZZ`, `QQ`, `RR`, `CC`, and `GF`. There's only a trivial Sphinx formatting issue, which is fixed in the reviewer patch `trac_6016-reviewer.patch`.

I am not sure this should go in as is since the return result is a little strange. Is this consistent with other interfaces in Sage? What does Magma do?

This is entirely consistent with (for example) factorization of rational numbers in Sage:

```
sage: QQ(123/456).factor()
2^-3 * 19^-1 * 41
```
Magma does not allow factorization in QQ or in function fields, which is very annoying (e.g. you cannot factor the discriminant of an elliptic curve (with integral model) over QQ without coercing it into ZZ first).  But Magma does allow for some non-integral factorizations, e.g. of fractional ideals.

So Michael's worry is a reasonable one but this should definitely be included.  I have therefore removed the "needs discussion" tag!
