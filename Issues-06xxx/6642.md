From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/85929d86accdf94d):

```
     sage: theta = var('theta')
     sage: solve(cos(theta)==sin(theta))
```
should produce

```
     [sin(theta) == cos(theta)]
```
but instead it produces

```

The first version of this -- `solve(cos(theta)==sin(theta))` -- is in the tutorial, and so presumably used to work.  

See #6572 for a related ticket which, among other things, tells doctesting to skip this test in the tutorial.  If the underlying problem is solved, the test in the tutorial should be restored, and of course a test should be put into the main Sage code illustrating that it now works.

<a id='comment:2'></a>In 4.1.2.alpha1, I'm getting something odd when I don't specify `explicit_solutions`:

```
sage: solve(sin(x) == cos(x), x, explicit_solutions=False)
[sin(x) == cos(x)]
sage: solve(sin(x) == cos(x), x, explicit_solutions=True)
[]
sage: solve(sin(x) == cos(x), x)
[x == r2, x == r1]
```
I think at least two changes are in order, if I understand the code right: first, change the default value for explicit_solutions from "None" to "False".  As it stands, in the "if" block that starts with the line

```
if explicit_solutions is not False:
```
the code is executed if explicit_solutions is None or True, but not if it's False.  I suppose this line could be changed to

```
if bool(explicit_solutions) is not False:
```
Second, several comments ("We only reach this if explicit_solutions is None", "This is fine because explicit_solutions is None") may need to be changed to reflect this.

Of course, I could be misunderstanding everything, and we want "False", "True", and "None" to each behave differently.  If so, this needs to be documented; for example, "explicit_solutions" is not a bool in this case.
