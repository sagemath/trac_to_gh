As it was already observed before, there are problems with using LatticePolytope for polytopes with many vertices/points. The problem occurs during pipe calls to PALP for single polytopes and can be avoided using lattice_polytope.all_* functions which work with files. 

This patch switches all interaction with PALP to files by default, while allowing the old method as an option.

It may affect the speed, but I cannot detect the difference on sage.math. On the other hand, in many cases I had to deal with polytopes which worked fine and fast through files and lead to hang-ups with pipes.
