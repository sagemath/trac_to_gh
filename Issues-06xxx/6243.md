From Alex Raichev on sage-support:

```
Hi all:

Upon upgrading to Sage 4.0, i can no longer make a dictionary with
derivatives as keys (see below).  Can someone please fix this?

I suppose an immediate fix is to implement the derivative method in `sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.Converter`. I believe the right fix is to change pynac to pass on the parent for numerical approximation instead of just the precision. I'll work on making the necessary changes in pynac.

I have a fix for this in my local pynac tree. I took a shortcut and changed the fderivative hashes to include the parameters.

I'll make a new pynac package with fixes for some other bugs available soon.

I tested this out. Pynac changes seem fine to me. I encountered one issue though:

```
sage: d = {}
sage: d[x] = 1
sage: d
{x: 1}
sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: d[diff(f(x),x)] = 2
sage: d.keys()
[D[0](f)(x), x]
sage: d.values()
[2, 1]
sage: d
!boom!
```

The origin of this !boom! lies in expression_conversions.py for fderivative
which is clearly NOT in purview of this patch. So I am going to give it a positive review 
shortly.
