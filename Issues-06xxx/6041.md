A new spkg is up at



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/networkx-0.99.p1.spkg



Unfortunately, as I suspected version 0.99 of NetworkX breaks a lot of doctests:

```
The following tests failed:

You should definitely get a good night's sleep before you tackle that!

I would suggest you start by seeing what needs to be fixed to get the doctests in

```
devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.py
```
to work properly. This is where Sage and NetworkX mainly plug in to each other. Once those are fixed, I expect much of the rest will be already done.

Here I assume that `NetworkXGraphBackend` is an undirected graph without multiple edges.\n1. `loops` -- This is irrelevant with the API changes in NetworkX 0.99, since the class `Graph` from NetworkX 0.99 allows for self-loops without having to explicitly set it with a boolean.\n2. `multiple_edges` -- Again irrelevant since the class `Graph` doesn't allow multiple edges.

I managed to get all doctests in `sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.py` to pass, but at the expense of deleting the following methods from the class `NetworkXGraphBackend`. Here I assume that `NetworkXGraphBackend` is an undirected graph without multiple edges.
1. `loops` -- This is irrelevant with the API changes in NetworkX 0.99, since the class `Graph` from NetworkX 0.99 allows for self-loops without having to explicitly set it with a boolean.
2. `multiple_edges` -- Again irrelevant since the class `Graph` doesn't allow multiple edges. Graphs with multiple edges should now be constructed via the class `MultiGraph` (not directed), or `MultiDiGraph` which allows for directed arcs.
Here's a diff of the changes to `sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.py`:

Here I assume that `NetworkXGraphBackend` is an undirected graph without multiple edges.\n\n> \n> Incorrect. NetworkXGraphBackend is simply a wrapper for a NetworkX graph, which can be directed, or have multiple edges.\n  \nAgreed. Version 0.99 now has:\n   * `Graph` --- An undirected graph class without multiple (parallel) edges.\n   * `DiGraph` --- A directed graph that allows self-loops, but not multiple (parallel) edges.\n   * `MultiGraph` --- An undirected graph that allows multiple (parallel) edges with arbitrary data on the edges.\n   * `MultiDiGraph` --- A directed graph that allows multiple (parallel) edges with arbitrary data on the edges.\nThese have been lifted off from the NetworkX 0.99 documentation. `MultiGraph` is the successor to `XGraph` where we allow `XGraph` to have multiple edges. And `MultiDiGraph` is the successor to `XDiGraph` with multiple edges. According to the API change log at\n\n\n\nhttp://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/api_changes.html\n\n\n\nPreviously `XGraph` handle undirected graphs with or without multiple edges, and `XDiGraph` handle directed graphs with or without multiple edges. Now there are four graph classes instead of two, for handling the different types of graphs.\n\n\n\n\n> >  1. `loops` -- This is irrelevant with the API changes in NetworkX 0.99, since the class `Graph` from NetworkX 0.99 allows for self-loops without having to explicitly set it with a boolean.\n> >  2. `multiple_edges` -- Again irrelevant since the class `Graph` doesn't allow multiple edges.

It's there for discussion and to explore ways to maintain compatibility with the existing API in `graph_backends.py`. But as you can see, the diff clearly breaks compatibility :-)\n\n\n\n\n> > It looks like anything under `sage/graphs/` that uses `sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.py` should be changed accordingly.\n\n> \n> Don't forget all of the rest of Sage!

Agreed. Version 0.99 now has:
   * `Graph` --- An undirected graph class without multiple (parallel) edges.
   * `DiGraph` --- A directed graph that allows self-loops, but not multiple (parallel) edges.
   * `MultiGraph` --- An undirected graph that allows multiple (parallel) edges with arbitrary data on the edges.
   * `MultiDiGraph` --- A directed graph that allows multiple (parallel) edges with arbitrary data on the edges.
These have been lifted off from the NetworkX 0.99 documentation. `MultiGraph` is the successor to `XGraph` where we allow `XGraph` to have multiple edges. And `MultiDiGraph` is the successor to `XDiGraph` with multiple edges. According to the API change log at



http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/api_changes.html



Previously `XGraph` handle undirected graphs with or without multiple edges, and `XDiGraph` handle directed graphs with or without multiple edges. Now there are four graph classes instead of two, for handling the different types of graphs.

> >  2. `multiple_edges` -- Again irrelevant since the class `Graph` doesn't allow multiple edges. Graphs with multiple edges should now be constructed via the class `MultiGraph` (not directed), or `MultiDiGraph` which allows for directed arcs.

What needs to happen is for loops and multiedges to become properties of the backend, and for the appropriate work to go on there. We still need to support these options. You should be working on top of the `part-1` patch at #6085, since it implements part of this in `graph.py` (and so that we're less likely to be stepping on each other's toes).

Thanks you for the pointer.

No, the diff isn't meant to be committed in the future. It's there for discussion and to explore ways to maintain compatibility with the existing API in `graph_backends.py`. But as you can see, the diff clearly breaks compatibility :-)

OK, let me see what I can do.

Actually, there were also `Graph` and `DiGraph`, which did not have labels...

You can still post diffs as attachments. It makes the discussion much easier to follow when you're reading the ticket, and it keeps clutter down. Just add the note "not to be applied" if you're worried...

It should be possible to get all of the doctests in Sage working by changing only things which call `networkx` directly (i.e. things involving `import networkx`), and the `NetworkXGraphBackend` class in `graph_backends.py`. Keep in mind that there are several interchangeable backends. In your diff, you were actually changing the signature of some of the backend functions-- this is bad.
