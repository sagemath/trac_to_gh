The first one is readily fixed by the category patches #5891. Please don't fix it separately so as not to create a conflict!

I'm attaching a fix for the second error above -- the `split` function was in the file, but commented out. I confirmed with David Roe that it should, indeed, be uncommented still (because we still don't have an implementation of Round4 in Sage). 

Amusingly, this was debugged during our Math 480 class -- successfully, though saying "oh, it's going to raise a different error" was probably a little unsatisfying.

The other error in the description is indeed fixed.

Positive review.  Patch applies, doctests pass.

Note that this ticket has two separate bug reports; the first bug was already fixed (presumably, as nthiery promised, by the category patches).  trac-6186.patch fixes the second.
