If someone attempts to access a URL for a published worksheet that no longer exists (perhaps because the URL changed when the worksheet went through a published to unpublished to published cycle), or the URL was mistyped, they get a blank page titled "Error | Sage Notebook", with no hint on what to do to resolve the problem.

If they are trying to access a published worksheet that cannot be found, it is probably useful to redirect to the page with the list of published worksheets, perhaps after showing an error message like "There is no worksheet currently available at this URL. You will be redirected to the <a href='URL of published worksheets index'>index of published worksheets</a> in 15 seconds."

V3 should

* Fix #8234.
* Use a title more appropriate than `Error` for certain non-Error pages (see the patch).
* Make "Sign Out" redirect to "/" when `require_login=False`.  This is better than returning a page whose header refers to a user named "None" and has a broken "Home" link!
