This is the first implementation of Ligozat's method of calculating the rational cuspidal subgroup of J_0(N). This is done by doing linear algebra in d(N)*d(N) matrices, which seems considerably faster than the modular symbol methods.

This code is functional at this point. The problems with it are

a) __cmp__ is not called.

b) Hecke operators aren't defined yet.

c) can't coerce specific degree zero cuspidal divisors in our group.

Can you be more careful that the docstrings match what they are documenting, e.g., \n{{{\n764\t    def _sub_(self, other): \n \t765\t        r\"\"\" \n \t766\t        Adds two elements in the cuspidal subgroup. \n}}}\nIt should be \"Subtract\" not add. \n\n5. \n{{{\n        827\t    def __cmp__(self, other): \n \t828\t        r\"\"\" \n \t829\t        Checks if two elements are the same. Right now this is not called, and I'm not sure why. \n}}}\n\nYou probably need to use/call __richmp__ instead...  there is some funny rule that if you define __cmp__ you have to also define __hash__ or something. Search sage-devel about this. \n\n7. Change this\n{{{\n        495\t        TESTS: \n \t496\t            sage: J=J0(25) \n}}}\nto\n{{{\n        495\t        TESTS::\n        496\n \t497\t            sage: J=J0(25) \n}}}\n\n8. I'm not sure about the name \"RationalDirectCuspidalSubgroup\".  Maybe \"RationalCuspidalSubgroupLigozat\" or something, i.e., use \"Ligozat\" instead of direct?",

EXAMPLES::  

    sage:
```
(note the newline)

3. Everywhere you have -'d lists, e.g.,

```
        691	        - `` parent`` - a subgroup of the cuspidal subgroup of  
 	692	        J0(N) 
 	693	 
 	694	        - ``element`` - an element in the quotient module of degree zero divisors of cusps 
 	695	        modulo principal divisors. 
 	696	 
 	697	        - ``check`` - bool (default: False) whether to check 
 	698	        that element is in the appropriate module 
```
change them so the second line (etc.) starts exactly two spaces in from the dash so it lines up with the previous line's text, e.g., 

```
        691	        - `` parent`` - a subgroup of the cuspidal subgroup of  
 	692	          J0(N) 
 	693	 
 	694	        - ``element`` - an element in the quotient module of degree zero divisors of cusps 
 	695	          modulo principal divisors. 
 }}}

4. Can you be more careful that the docstrings match what they are documenting, e.g., 
{{{
764	    def _sub_(self, other): 
 	765	        r""" 
 	766	        Adds two elements in the cuspidal subgroup. 
}}}
It should be "Subtract" not add. 

5. 
{{{
        827	    def __cmp__(self, other): 
 	828	        r""" 
 	829	        Checks if two elements are the same. Right now this is not called, and I'm not sure why. 
}}}

You probably need to use/call __richmp__ instead...  there is some funny rule that if you define __cmp__ you have to also define __hash__ or something. Search sage-devel about this. 

7. Change this
{{{
        495	        TESTS: 
 	496	            sage: J=J0(25) 
}}}
to
{{{
        495	        TESTS::
        496
 	497	            sage: J=J0(25) 
}}}

8. I'm not sure about the name "RationalDirectCuspidalSubgroup".  Maybe "RationalCuspidalSubgroupLigozat" or something, i.e., use "Ligozat" instead of direct?

Chapoton's fix was correct. The initial doctest was incorrect.

Also, that is the correct Ligozat reference. I added the reference to my paper as well, which is what the algorithm is based upon.

I changed the name of rational_direct_cuspidal_subgroup to rational_cuspidal_subgroup_ligozat, as it was suggested, and replaced cmp function with eq and ne functions instead.

Finally, sorry for being MIA on this ticket for so long. I think I had an incorrect filter archiving these emails automatically.
