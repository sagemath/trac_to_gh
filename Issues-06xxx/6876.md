For **nth_prime**

```
sage: plot(nth_prime(x), (x, 1, 100))
```

also gives an error, but

```
sage: plot(nth_prime, (1, 100))
```

works.

This is because it implements its own variable handling, instead of using the standard sage.plot.misc.setup_for_eval_on_grid function (which, to be fair, probably wasn't around when prime_pi was written).

There are plenty of examples of how to use setup_for_eval_on_grid in the plotting code.  Possibly, the variable-handling code should be factored out of that function as well.

Here is what *did already* work.

```
sage: plot(prime_pi,1,1000)
```
because

```
Definition:	prime_pi.plot(self, xmin, xmax=0, vertical_lines=100, **kwds=True)
Docstring:
```
So really we want to make prime_pi symbolic.  Same with nth_prime, presumably.

And it so happens that #11475 has done so, though unfortunately keeping a custom plotting method intact.

```
sage: plot(prime_pi(x), (x, 1, 100)) # works with #11475
sage: plot(prime_pi, (x, 1, 100)) # gives empty plot with #11475 since it is the same as doing sage: prime_pi.plot((x,1,100))
sage: plot(prime_pi,(1,100)) # same
sage: plot(prime_pi, x, 1, 100) # error about floats
sage: plot(prime_pi(x), x, 1, 100) # works with #11475
```
So we would want to someone modify that work to make the other things work that should.  And same for `nth_prime`.

Prime_pi should have a custom plotting method since it is a *step function* so plotting via sampling will be very misleading.

Oh, duh, yes you're right.  So this means the plot at #11475 I just added is bad (actually, it's fine, because we sample plenty, but for larger regions it won't be), so I'm removing it.
