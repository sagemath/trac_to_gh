This issue is that

```
sage: isinstance(True, int)
True
sage: isinstance(True, bool)
True
sage: isinstance(1, bool)
False
```

so the output depended on the order in which items of the latex_table dict were iterated.  This is fixed by changing latex_table to a list so that bool comes first.

Here's another possible fix for the latex_table issue:

``` 
        try:
            f = latex_table[type(x)]
            return LatexExpr(f(x))
        except KeyError:
            if x is None:
                return LatexExpr("\\mbox{\\mathrm{None}}")
            return LatexExpr(str_function(str(x)))
```
Since `type(True)` returns `bool`, this looks up the right thing.  Is this approach better or worse than the one in your patch?
