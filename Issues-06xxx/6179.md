Attachment: **[trac_6179.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6179/trac_6179.patch.gz)**

This issue is that

```
sage: isinstance(True, int)
True
sage: isinstance(True, bool)
True
sage: isinstance(1, bool)
False
```

so the output depended on the order in which items of the latex_table dict were iterated.  This is fixed by changing latex_table to a list so that bool comes first.

Here's another possible fix for the latex_table issue:

``` 
        try:
            f = latex_table[type(x)]
            return LatexExpr(f(x))
        except KeyError:
            if x is None:
                return LatexExpr("\\mbox{\\mathrm{None}}")
            return LatexExpr(str_function(str(x)))
```
Since `type(True)` returns `bool`, this looks up the right thing.  Is this approach better or worse than the one in your patch?  

The try/except approach helps to avoid accidental lookups in the table, but were those being used intentionally for anything?  For example, does `isinstance(blah, int)` return True for other classes that we care about for typesetting?  I tend to think that we should be more explicit rather than implicit (so add more entries `new-type: str` if we want more types to behave the way ints do), so I would favor the dictionary lookup approach.
