Although the patch above isn't finished, I do consider it polished for what it does. The next steps are:

1. plug into NTL for factoring over FF_p[X] for large p.

2. incorporate the optimization based on linear algebra in QQ*/(QQ*)^2.

3. do second descents in the case that the exact rank is not found.

4. General two-descent -- I have a rudimentary version of this in a notebook worksheet, which will eventually wind up here.

Although not in a completely finished state, comments are still welcome!

For my purposes (working within Cremona's big table, N<130000), the dimensions of the subspaces of Q*/(Q*)^2 I am considering are 

0: 242 cases
1: 15019 cases
2: 93479 cases
3: 141373 cases
4: 59005 cases
5: 7339 cases
6: 187 cases

Based on this, I do not consider it a priority to do #2. The others are also not necessary for my purposes, so I'm doing some serious triage and getting this into a mergable state now. These other enhancements can come later.

Applying the patch and doing "sage -t" yields some failures, probably because you assume the large cremona database is installed, but it isn't:

Ok. I tested the patches and they all go through. Also the -coverage gives 6 out of 6 despite the fact that many functions in descent_two_isogeny.pyx lack a good documentation and especially examples are missing often. I guess this is because cdefs are not tested. (I admit I never reviewed a cython file.)

Currently the main function gives back four integers, like mwrank does. They are useful to compute an upper bound on the rank of the Mordell-Weil group and should (in the future) be called from `rank()` and also from `sha()`.

Personnally I would like more, namely I would like to have a phi-Selmer group. Ideally we should give back a abelian group associated to the elliptic curve, or even better to the isogeny. But isogenies are not there yet, though 2-isogenies should be. The Selmer groups would contain more information than just these four integers and I believe this extra-information is already computed in this algorithm.

Right now the functions are not callable without an extra import and so they do not pollute the name-space and we are still flexible in how to do this later; like `.selmer_group()` etc. That is very good. Yet it does not really look like a finished patch.

It is work in progress (and it is very good work in the right direction), but I am incapable of saying whether this sort of work should already be included in sage or not. So before giving a positive review to this patch, I would like to ask the author's and other's opinion on this.

A couple of follow-up points to Chris, from an independent observer:  first, can we have some motivation, such as examples where this works better than calling mwrank?  There will certainly be curves for which the performance is worse (where mwrank would use a second descent).  I suspect that any enhanced perofrmance comes from the use of the more recent version of ratpoints than mwrank uses.

Here's an example where mwrank does not do a second descent, where the runtime is approximately 90 times faster:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('676a1')
sage: from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.descent_two_isogeny import two_descent_by_two_isogeny
sage: timeit('two_descent_by_two_isogeny(E)')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.83 ms per loop
sage: A = E.mwrank_curve()
sage: timeit('A.two_descent(verbose=False)')
5 loops, best of 3: 252 ms per loop
```

I ran the following to compare times in general:

```
sage: for E in cremona_optimal_curves(range(200)):
...    if E.torsion_order()%2 == 0:
...        t = walltime()
...        E.mwrank_curve().two_descent(verbose=False, second_descent=False)
...        t = walltime(t)
...        s = walltime()
...        _ = two_descent_by_two_isogeny(E)
...        s = walltime(s)
```

mwrank is always slower by a factor of at least 5, almost always slower by a factor of at least 20, and frequently slower by factors of up to 150.

I was just trying to address your question whether there were examples where this was better than mwrank. Your second comment, "any enhanced performance comes from the use of the more recent version of ratpoints" is very false: if I remove the use of ratpoints altogether, the speedup factors increase!

```
sage: L = []
sage: for E in cremona_optimal_curves(range(200)):
    if E.torsion_order()%2 == 0:
        A = E.mwrank_curve()
        t = walltime()
        A.two_descent(verbose=False, selmer_only=True, second_descent=False)
        t = walltime(t)
        s = walltime()
        _ = two_descent_by_two_isogeny(E, selmer_only=True)

Thus I argue that this code is definitely worth including, especially since this exact code was the main motivation for including ratpoints in Sage in the first place. I don't know what "typical" means regarding the conductor bound, especially since I'm primarily interested in curves with small conductor.

2. The main concern in Chris's report is just that this code doesn't yet do enough.  However, rlm isn't just writing this as some one-off thing for a little project.  He's doing his Ph.D. thesis mostly on descent (and its applications), and this is what he'll be working on fulltime, probably for the next year (for his thesis, then his postdoc).  So I think getting this in now makes *perfect* sense, instead of waiting until we get a big patch bomb later. 

3. All those cdef'd methods with no doctests and minimal documentation isn't good, just as Chris says.  You could open another ticket and fix that, since it will make it way easier for others to work on (and use in surprising ways!) this code if those functions are documented and tested.  For each cdef'd method, just make a corresponding def'd method called "test_..." that calls the cdef'd method, then put the tests there.   You already do just that in *some* cases, e.g., `def test_els(a,b,c,d,e):`. 

4. Docstrings like this would be more readable if they used latex:

```
Given an elliptic curve E with a two-isogeny phi : E --> E' and dual isogeny 
 	799	    phi', runs a two-isogeny descent on E, returning n1, n2, n1' and n2'. Here 
 	800	    n1 is the number of quartic covers found with a rational point, and n2 is 
 	801	    the number which are ELS. 
```

5. All tests pass with this code applied to sage-4.3.alpha1.

In summary:

I've applied the patches, skimmed them, and run the test suite.  Positive review.
