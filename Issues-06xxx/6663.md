The 4ti2 and glpk packages in experimental are very out of date.  Since there seems to be some growing interest in having them available in sage they should be updated.  If they can be made to work on more platforms they should be moved to optional.

This installed fine and passed sage -testall (except for the known failures) on an intel macbook with 4.1.1.a0 running OS 10.4.11.

This gets a positive review from me. Are there more tests which should be run before "needs review" gets changed to "positive review"?

I have downloaded the spkg to my home directory:



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/4ti2.p0.spkg



Is there any special reason why the package is not under revision control?

```
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ tar -jxf 4ti2.p0.spkg 
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ cd 4ti2.p0/
[mvngu@mod 4ti2.p0]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
