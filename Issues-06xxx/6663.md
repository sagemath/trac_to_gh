I was unaware of the glpk package at:

which has a more recent version of glpk.  That spkg should be used instead of mine.

This installed fine and passed sage -testall (except for the known failures) on an intel macbook with 4.1.1.a0 running OS 10.4.11.

This gets a positive review from me. Are there more tests which should be run before "needs review" gets changed to "positive review"?

<a id='comment:7'>**Comment 7:**</a>
I have downloaded the spkg to my home directory:



http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/4ti2.p0.spkg



Is there any special reason why the package is not under revision control?

```
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ tar -jxf 4ti2.p0.spkg 
[mvngu@mod mvngu]$ cd 4ti2.p0/
[mvngu@mod 4ti2.p0]$ hg st
abort: There is no Mercurial repository here (.hg not found)!
```
