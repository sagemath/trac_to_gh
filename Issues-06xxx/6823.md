Hi Nathann,

This will be a nice addition to the graph generators.  Some suggestions:

1.  How about giving the graph a name with the parameters in the string, like "Kneser graph with parameters 5 and 2"?

2.  The patch just seems to be a diff file, so it really should be a Mercurial patch with your name/email and a one-line comment.  Patch files now seem to uniformly have filenames that begin with "trac_xxxx_" and you should put the trac number in the one-line summary of the Mercurial patch.

3.  I'd really like to see more robust handling of the inputs (and doctests to see that they work).  For example, a negative n will bomb in the subset code.  How about checking that `n >= 0` and then that  `0 <= k <= n`?

4.  English is very good, but I'd suggest "adjacent" or "joined" instead of "linked" and "with parameters" instead of "of parameters" (three places).

With this completed, it'll be easy to add the Odd graphs - just Kneser graphs with n=2k+1.

This passes all tests in sage/graphs and the documentation builds fine.

Rob

Nathann,

Looks very good, builds on 4.1.2.alpha2, passes all tests, etc.

Right now the name of an odd graph reports the Kneser graph parameters, etc.  I'd expect this to confuse someone who builds an odd graph, yet does not know the connection to the Kneser graphs.  I've attached a small patch that just sets the name on the odd graph routine.  If you agree with the change, then you can mark the ticket as positive review.  In other words, you can review my additional patch, and we'll be done.

Thanks,
Rob
