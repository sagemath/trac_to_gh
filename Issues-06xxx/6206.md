Tiny patch moves algebraic_closure method up the tree; I claim this is "obviously" the correct place for it to be, but you only hit this bug (missing method) when you are using strange embeddings of number fields and I don't have a good example at hand.

Just a sec, while we're at it, I just noticed the docstring is wrong. It speaks of the "Complex Double Field" rather than "Complex Lazy Field." This was probably originally my fault, but might as well fix it now.
