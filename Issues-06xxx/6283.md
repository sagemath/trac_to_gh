The top of SAGE_ROOT/makefile is

```
# How many threads should be used when doing parallel testing (and
# sometime in the future, parallel building)?
NUM_THREADS=20

```

I've many times accidently done "make ptest" and with extremely unpleasant results the next day.

I'm not sure what "intelligently" means, but here is a patch which sets it to be the number of processors, as detected by `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.  This also changes the command `sage -tp N <files>`: if N is 0, then replace it with the number of processors.

This depends on the patch at #2624.

I'm happy to ignore this.  If it returns the "wrong" number, that seems like a bug in Python.

I don't have access to many different kinds of machines.  Should we ask people on sage-devel to test `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`?

The file `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` has been manually patched to include the changes in `makefile.patch`. I have also included a warning about using the default value of zero, i.e. having `NUM_THREADS=0` which is the default:

```
# NUM_THREADS is the number of threads to use for parallel testing              
# (and sometime in the future, parallel building).  If this is 0, then

I think people should be made aware that having a value of zero means that all the cores/processors on their system would be devoted to parallel doctesting. On a personal machine, that's OK and any damage done would be localized to the person's own machine. But on a multi-user machine such as the machines making up the Sage cluster, bsd.math, etc., the default value of zero can be dangerous because on sage.math, say, this would use 24 cores for parallel doctesting.

The patch `trac_6283-warning.patch` also adds a warning to this effect to the file `sage-ptest`. If you want to use the file `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` for parallel doctesting, be absolute sure that you have set a sensible positive integer for `NUM_THREADS`.

Agreed.

I think a value of 1 would be sensible. No matter if one runs doctest using `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` on a personal machine such as a Pentium 4, a dual core PC or sage.math, it would still use one thread as default. After manually merging changes to `SAGE_ROOT/makefile`, I did:

```
make ptestlong

only to realize that it spawned 24 cores on mod.math to parallel doctest. In panic mode, I hastily killed all of my threads. So how about opening another ticket to make `NUM_THREADS=1`?
