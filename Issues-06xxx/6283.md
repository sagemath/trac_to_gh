The top of SAGE_ROOT/makefile is

```
# How many threads should be used when doing parallel testing (and
# sometime in the future, parallel building)?
NUM_THREADS=20

```

I've many times accidently done "make ptest" and with extremely unpleasant results the next day.

I'm not sure what "intelligently" means, but here is a patch which sets it to be the number of processors, as detected by `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.  This also changes the command `sage -tp N <files>`: if N is 0, then replace it with the number of processors.

This depends on the patch at #2624.

I'm happy to ignore this.  If it returns the "wrong" number, that seems like a bug in Python.

The file `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` has been manually patched to include the changes in `makefile.patch`. I have also included a warning about using the default value of zero, i.e. having `NUM_THREADS=0` which is the default:

```

Agreed.

I think a value of 1 would be sensible. No matter if one runs doctest using `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` on a personal machine such as a Pentium 4, a dual core PC or sage.math, it would still use one thread as default. After manually merging changes to `SAGE_ROOT/makefile`, I did:

```
make ptestlong
```
only to realize that it spawned 24 cores on mod.math to parallel doctest. In panic mode, I hastily killed all of my threads. So how about opening another ticket to make `NUM_THREADS=1`?

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
