The top of SAGE_ROOT/makefile is

```
# How many threads should be used when doing parallel testing (and
# sometime in the future, parallel building)?
NUM_THREADS=20

```

I've many times accidently done "make ptest" and with extremely unpleasant results the next day.

I'm not sure what "intelligently" means, but here is a patch which sets it to be the number of processors, as detected by `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.  This also changes the command `sage -tp N <files>`: if N is 0, then replace it with the number of processors.

This depends on the patch at #2624.

I'm happy to ignore this.  If it returns the "wrong" number, that seems like a bug in Python.

I don't have access to many different kinds of machines.  Should we ask people on sage-devel to test `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`?

The file `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` has been manually patched to include the changes in `makefile.patch`. I have also included a warning about using the default value of zero, i.e. having `NUM_THREADS=0` which is the default:

```
# NUM_THREADS is the number of threads to use for parallel testing

Most of the time, people are running very long jobs on sage.math, mod.math, and geom.math. Using all 24 cores on any of these machines can have unexpected consequences such as having doctest failures due to segfaults, out of memory error, and even bringing those machines offline. The patch `trac_6283-warning.patch` also adds a warning to this effect to the file `sage-ptest`. If you want to use the file `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` for parallel doctesting, be absolute sure that you have set a sensible positive integer for `NUM_THREADS`.

I realise this has got positive review, but I would have personally not given it that. I would have personally not allowed the default to exceed 8, since for 99% of machines with 8 or more 'CPUs/threads', they are mutli-user servers, not personal workstations.

On 't2' currently this would not cause an issue, since it is not used a lot. But it would be an issue once there are many users. I doubt it would be sensible on sage.math to exploit it to the full.

Agreed.

I think a value of 1 would be sensible. No matter if one runs doctest using `SAGE_ROOT/makefile` on a personal machine such as a Pentium 4, a dual core PC or sage.math, it would still use one thread as default. After manually merging changes to `SAGE_ROOT/makefile`, I did:
