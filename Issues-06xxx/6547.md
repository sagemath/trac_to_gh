For historical reasons, we are using `foo.all.py` instead of `foo.__init__.py`. This is not Pythonic and we should change that (gradually).

Also, the developer's guide needs an update reflecting this change:

One thing that we need to watch out for is importing an object into `foo/__init__.py` with the same name as a module in `foo/`.  Something like:

```
mike@mike-laptop:~/src/test_init$ ls foo
bar.py  bar.pyc  __init__.py  __init__.pyc
mike@mike-laptop:~/src/test_init$ cat foo/__init__.py
from bar import bar
mike@mike-laptop:~/src/test_init$ cat foo/bar.py
bar = 200
```

Then, things like `foo.bar.bar` won't work.

A more specific objection:

Currently in Sage, we have

```
sage: type(sage.plot.plot)
<type 'module'>
sage: type(sage.plot.all.plot)
<type 'function'>
```

If we get rid of `all.py`, what should `sage.plot.plot` be?
