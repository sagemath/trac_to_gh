If `c` is of type `CC`, then `c.abs()` returns the absolute value of a complex number and `c.norm()` returns the norm of a complex number. One problem with this is that the absolute value of a complex number is also referred to as the complex norm. This problem was noticed in IRC:

```
15:32 < greg> the sage command norm() returns the modulus squared of complex
             numbers, is this the desired behavior?
15:44 < mvngu> greg: If c is a complex number (type CC), then c.norm() returns
              the complex norm of c. That is, if c = a + bi then c.norm()
              returns a^2 + b^2.
15:44 < mvngu> Is that what you mean?
15:46 < greg> isn't the complex norm typicaly sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
15:50 < mvngu> greg: That's the absolute value. In that case, use c.abs().
15:53 < mvngu> And I agree that there's various names for this: modulue of
              complex number, absolute value of complex number, complex norm.
15:54 < greg> mvngu: okay thanks
15:54 < mvngu> So it clarifies for you?
15:56 < greg> yeah, I think so.
15:56 < greg> out of curiosity, where is a^2 + b^2 typically used as the norm?
             I'm checking mathworld and wikipedia and my complex analysis
             books and they all use the L2 norm
15:58 < mvngu> You know Gaussian integers?
15:58 < greg> yeah
15:58 < greg> okay i see that
15:58 < greg> cool thanks
15:58 < mvngu> yeah... the norm of a Gaussian integer is defined like that.
15:59 < greg> okay i see
```
