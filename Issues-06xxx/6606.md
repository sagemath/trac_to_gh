The code loooked (though I would have written p**(3*e-2)*(p*p-1) ) but after applying to 4.1:

```
sage: Gamma(19).index()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/john/.sage/temp/ubuntu/25083/_home_john__sage_init_sage_0.py in <module>()

/home/john/sage-4.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/congroup_gamma.pyc in index(self)
    105             32893086819240
    106         """
--> 107         return prod([p**(3*e) - p**(3*e-2) for (p,e) in self.level().factor()])
    108 
```

Looks like someone forgot to run sage -t before submitting the patch...
