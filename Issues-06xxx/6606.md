The code loooked (though I would have written p**(3*e-2)*(p*p-1) ) but after applying to 4.1:

```
sage: Gamma(19).index()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/john/sage-4.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/arithgroup/congroup_gamma.pyc in index(self)
    105             32893086819240

Looks like someone forgot to run sage -t before submitting the patch...
