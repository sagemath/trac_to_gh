It would be neat to be able to do:

`sage -docbuild foo.py`

for a single file not in the library.

The line

```
in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/multidocs.py` raises an error. I think we should disable this assertion when using the `file=...` argument to `sage --docbuild`.

This assert is in `citation_dir`. 
How should single-file docbuilds handle citations?

Ignore them? Or at least ignore references to citations in the Sage library: I think it should treat the single file as being unconnected to the Sage library.
