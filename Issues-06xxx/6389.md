It would be neat to be able to do:

`sage -docbuild foo.py`

for a single file not in the library.

This assert is in `citation_dir`. 
How should single-file docbuilds handle citations?

Ignore them? Or at least ignore references to citations in the Sage library: I think it should treat the single file as being unconnected to the Sage library.
