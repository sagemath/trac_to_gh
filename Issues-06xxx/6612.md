This is an enhancement to sage-update, that's triggerd by `sage -upgrade`. It downloads a list of available and up-to-date Sage mirrors, uses some heuristics to select a new one, and uses that instead of the default. This should further distribute the server load across the mirror network and speed up downloads. [>> see sage-devel discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5fb0ea3a8b396982#)

Things to test:

* script works and selects a mirror, there is a fallback to the current mode, so, it should not make things worse.
* the actual upgrade process works with the content that is actually mirrored. I've tested this and worked (4.0.2 > 4.1) but maybe someone else should give it a try, too.

**Resolution:** fixed

**Author:** Harald Schilly

**Reviewer:** Minh Van Nguyen

**Merged:** Sage 4.1.2.rc0

sidenote to all spkg maintainers for clarification:

mirroring the spkgs means that the current main repository of spkgs is essentially no longer used once this patch goes in. you have to push changes to any (standard) spkgs to the mirrors. that's the same procedure as with a new release and should be done in sync! testing is still possible by providing the url to the sagemath.org website, but it *does not automatically* work as it did until now! optional packages are not mirrored and also not covered by this patch, they are still located at the master server and this patch shouldn't mess around with them.

This error is just the same for all threads, that's why it looks scary.

Does anyone know how to circumvent this? I'm using python 2.6, that's why it works for me. Additionally, even through there are exceptions, the whole process works fine as you can see at the bottom. Those exceptions are just ignored and upgrading would work as usual.

Your version info banner is corrupted and i guess you cannot upgrade from a pre release to a release due to such collissions. you have to resolve all of them first. 

I just upgraded from 4.1 to 4.1.1 using the czech cvut.cz mirror. It worked fine!

I guess we need to document that in the update script. Essentially, the update script is for updating from one previous stable release to another new stable release.\n\n\n\n\n> I just upgraded from 4.1 to 4.1.1 using the czech cvut.cz mirror. It worked fine!\n\nIt worked fine for me too. I upgraded Sage 4.1 under Gentoo (running within VirtualBox) to Sage 4.1.1 using your patch. It went OK. Before I went home, I started the doctest suite and started to upgrade 4.1 under the Ubuntu host.

Hmm... I guess we need to document that in the update script. Essentially, the update script is for updating from one previous stable release to another new stable release.

yes, i'll change that, no problem.

That's a good point for your situation. I can enhance it by a litte menu, where you either hit "return" and you get the random-top-3 or you enter a number to select one from all of the mirrors. That shouldn't be too hard.

patches besides "-r2" can be deleted. now, it selects the "best" mirror automatically, uses the given one if there is any and asks the user which one to use if given url is "ask". additionally, this is documented in "sage-sage".

and i know, line indentations are wrong, but the file has "5" by default but sage policy is 4.

The two patches `6612-sage-update-mirror-network-r1.patch` and `6612-sage-update-mirror-network-r2.patch` look good to me. I have attached a reviewer patch `trac_6612-reviewer.patch` that include the following changes:

* Some formatting fixes to `sage-sage`.
* Remove the re-import of `urllib` and `socket`.
* Remove the unused import of `subprocess`.
* Remove multiple imports on one line.
* Use three double quotation marks `"` instead of three single quotation marks `'`.
* Use 4 space indentation.
* Spell checking.

If my patch gets some thumbs up, then the whole ticket can be merged for Sage 4.1.2.
