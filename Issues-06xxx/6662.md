This patch exposes the general discrete distribution code in the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). It provides a fast way to sample from a user-defined discrete probability distribution, and it also extends the DiscreteProbabilitySpace class by allowing sampling from the defined distribution.

Why is the reference manual formatting broken? After doing "sage -docbuild reference html" the examples in the entry "Interface to gsl discrete random variable generator" in Probability have examples that are not formatted. Why? What's going wrong with the docstring formatting in my pyx file?

This patch installs fine with 4.1.1.a1 on an amd64 machine running ubuntu 9.04. It passes sage -testall, except for the known failures.

I'm a little concerned about the docstrings. If I were more of a probability expert maybe this would not be an issue but not being an expert (which maybe is a good thing?) I don't see how to use it to do some basic sampling which might be useful for teaching a first course in probability.
