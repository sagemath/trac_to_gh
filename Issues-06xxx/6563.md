singular-3-1-0-2-20090620 appeared to install on a Solaris machine, with the file $SAGE_HOME/spkg/installed/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620 existing. 

However, it was later realised that some of the singular header files were not copied to $SAGE_HOME/local/include/singular. Closer inspection of the install.log showed: 

```

make[1]: Entering directory 
`/export/home/drkirkby/sage/sage-4.1/spkg/build/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620/src/kernel'
./mkinstalldirs /export/home/drkirkby/sage/sage-4.1/local/include/singular
for file in *.h; do ../.././install-sh -c $file 
/export/home/drkirkby/sage/sage-4.1/local/include/singular; done
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
```



Changing to the directory 
`/export/home/drkirkby/sage/sage-4.1/spkg/build/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620/src/kernel' 
and doing an 'ls' of ../.././ I see that it got me to the root directory 
of the singular installation - by that I mean where spkh-install, 
SPKG.txt etc exist.

Copying install-sh to there solved the problem.

Willem Jan Palenstijn said on sage-devel:

''If I understand things correctly, this is what happens:
when src/Singular/config.status outputs ../kernel/Makefile, it
interprets the two slashes in that path as the output file being two
subdirectories down from Makefile, and so adjusts (the correct)
'./install.sh' (i.e., actually src/Singular/install-sh) to (the broken)''

'../.././install.sh' .

''The reason this doesn't show up on my system (and presumably other
systems) is that /usr/bin/install (with an absolute path) is found and used
instead of ./install.sh.''

[actually, the missing file is install-sh, not install.sh]

Whatever may or may not be the real reason for this, the simplest solution is to simply copy install-sh to the top level directory. I know it's not normal to do it this way, but it might be the quickest. I've created a patch based on doing just that. 
 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0/

The actual .spkg file is:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0.spkg

It should be noted there are about 10-15 identical copies of the file in the source distribution! Perhaps someone before had trouble find the file. 

So far this has only been seen on Solaris I believe. but is clearly not specifically a Solaris bug.

Did this ever get reported upstream?  Just wondering whether the fix is still needed today (making a new Singular spkg at #12137).

This quote from the description really made me laugh:
> It should be noted there are about 10-15 identical copies of the file in the source distribution! Perhaps someone before had trouble find the file.

So many copies but still not enough...
