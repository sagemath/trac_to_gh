```
Typesetting of real() and imag() methods are broken due to missing parenthesis.

```
sage: latex(x.real())
\Rex
```
"\Rex" is not a valid latex expression. It should be something
like "\Re\left(x\right)".

Similar issues are present also for Symbolic functions

```
sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: latex( f(x).imag())
\Imf\left(x\right)
```
Again it should be similar to "\Im\left(f\left(x\right)\right)".

Hi Burcin,

I am testing out the new pynac spkg. Seems alright to me so far. Out of curiosity: is there
any reason to print the extra spaces around the the argument of real() and imag()?

```
sage: latex(real(x))
\Re \left( x \right)
```
Given it differs a bit from your earlier convention for default typesetting of 
symbolic function

```
sage: psi(x) = function('psi',x)
sage: latex(psi(x))
\psi\left(x\right)
```

Otherwise, I am ready to give positive review as the output is valid latex expression in
both cases.
