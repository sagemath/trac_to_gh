Hello !

I thought it was a pity Sage contained nothing yet about Graph theory. This is what I have written to fix it... Merge any of your ideas in it, it can not hope to be complete !

And.... If I forgot your country when coloring the map of Western Europe, or if you do not stand to watch Western Europe being colored while your country is not, just add the data to the document ;-)

As mentionned, this ticket depends on:
* #6679
* #6680

No, you haven't.  These functions are defined in #6679 and #6680, which haven't been reviewed, let alone merged.  This ticket should have been marked as "depends on #6679 and #6680": we can't have functions mentioned in the tutorial which are not yet part of Sage.

When the tickets #6679 and #6680 have been merged, then open up a new ticket to reinstate the graph theory tour (the corrected version, as of #6952).  Before running doctests, apply the script patches from #6572 to make sure that everything is getting tested -- the current doctesting system is broken, so many doctests in .rst files are inadvertently skipped.

I would have prefered the fixing to be "let's review these two patches now to have a good Graph Theory Tour", but removing it for the moment is a good solution too..
Perhaps Minh just meant that he had applied the corresponding patches to test the tutorial..

The thing is that patches #6679 and #6680 define for Sage some of the most important functions in Graph Theory ( Flows, matching, graph coloring, connectivity, etc .. )

The first version is two month old, and since then I have had to update them each time class MIP is modified. I do not even know myself how many things I have yet to write based on these functions.. What could we do about it ? If the code is not commented enough, if the only things you need are references, tell me and they'll be there in a few seconds :-)

Is it just because it would be a legal problem for Sage to claim as "available" functions that we cannot provide without the addition of a software we are not allowed to embed ?

In this case I understand this decision, but you have to consider the fact that it is very likely 99% of Sage's graph theoretical functions will depend on Linear Programming by the time people REWRITE the functions I defined using Linear Programming through other means.

I'll just try again to find a free LP solver or an old version of GLPK. And in the meantine I'll just update my personnal tutorial on Graphs (available pretty soon).. :-)

It's because everything in the tutorial should "just work".  You shouldn't have to install anything extra, it should work right out of the box.

The graph theory tour as is cannot be added to the tutorial since it depends on an optional package. However, you can open a ticket to add that tour to the Constructions document.
