Hi,

I took the sage-4.1.1.alpha1 release build I had, then did "./sage -bdist", took the result, extracted it, and did "make test". 

 1) It sits there and builds the documentation again, which takes a *long* time.  It shouldn't do this for a binary.

 2) Worse, every single test failed, with errors like this:

sage -t  "/home/wstein/build/sage-4.1.1.alpha1/dist/sage-4.1.1.alpha1-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/doc/common/buil
der.py"
  File "./builder.py", line 18
    from /home/wstein/build/sage-4.1.1.alpha1/dist/sage-4.1.1.alpha1-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/doc/common/build
er import *
         ^

  3) I tried do "./sage" to run Sage, then typed "make test" again about 10 minutes ago.  For some reason, the docs are building again... and I expect the same behavior as above after that finally finishes.

Buiding Sage, doing "./sage -bdist", then extracting the result and having "make test" 100% is a blocker for making the sage-4.1.1 release.

<a id='comment:1'></a>It appears that the doc rebuild is a consequence of

```
#Build the documentation
rm -rf "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage-main/doc/output/doctrees
rm -rf "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/sage/*
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -docbuild --jsmath all html
```
at the end of `spkg/install`.  Perhaps we should recast this as a `make` target?  I think this is a problem in a source distribution, too.

But if I comment out these lines, then run `make test` in the binary distribution's root directory, the tests **still** fail...

On the failed tests:  The attached patch may help.  [os.path.realpath()](http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.realpath) expands all symbolic links.

Should `sage-bdist` set `SAGE_ROOT="....."` in `SAGE_ROOT/sage`?  **Lots** of tests fail, if `SAGE_ROOT` points to the original source distribution, at least for me.

On rebuilding the docs:  Is it enough to remove just the `rm -rf` lines?

To apply the new **non-Mercurial** patch, save it to `SAGE_ROOT/spkg`.  In that directory, run `patch < trac_6645-spkg_install.patch`.

Both patches together appear to solve the problems described in this ticket's description, at least for me.  But let me know, if they're not enough.

Why were the `rm -rf` lines first added to `spkg/install`?

1. Here comes a show-stopper: Wait for the test suite to finish or just preempt it with control-C. Manually rebuild the documentation with `./sage -docbuild all html`. Once the HTML version of the documentation has finished building, now run the test suite again with `make test`. This time, running the test suite would also rebuild the documentation.

3. But if you manually rebuild the documentation again with `./sage -docbuild all html`, then the HTML version of the documentation would be rebuilt as requested. This is interesting because we have already manually rebuilt the HTML version of the documentation.


The upshot is that manually rebuilding the HTML version of the documentation would also cause the documentation to be rebuilt when running the test suite with `make test`. But if you run the test suite with the latter command, then requesting a manual build of the documentation would be done as requested, regardless of whether or not the documentation has been built.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Here's another test which offers some hope: 

1. I took the source tarball of [sage-4.1.1.rc2](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1.rc2.tar), compiled it and built the documentation both in HTML and PDF formats with:
 {{{
./sage -docbuild all html
./sage -docbuild all pdf
 }}}
1. Applied the patch `trac_6645-scripts_doctest.patch` to the scripts repository in `SAGE_ROOT/local/bin`. Manually edited the file `SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` so it now reads
 {{{
#Build the documentation
#rm -rf "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage-main/doc/output/doctrees
#rm -rf "$SAGE_ROOT"/devel/sage-main/doc/en/reference/sage/*
#"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -docbuild --jsmath all html
"$SAGE_ROOT"/sage -docbuild all html
 }}}
1. Made an experimental source distribution of the patched `sage-4.1.1.rc2`, calling it say `sage-4.1.1.rc2-6645`.
2. Unpacked the experimental source distribution `sage-4.1.1.rc2-6645` and compiled it.
3. Made a binary version from the compiled source.
4. Unpacked the binary tarball. Issued `make`, `make test`, and `./sage -docbuild all html` in various permutations. In this case, the documentation didn't rebuild.
5. Ran the command `./sage -docbuild --jsmath all html` and the documentation was rebuilt. It also rebuilt with the command `./sage -docbuild all html`. But then `make test` skipped over rebuilding the documentation.
6. Ran the command `./sage -docbuild --jsmath all html` again and the documentation was rebuilt another time. Executed the command `make test` and the documentation was rebuilt again. But `./sage -docbuild all html` skipped over rebuilding the documentation.
So the culprit here is the option `--jsmath` to the docbuild script. I'm prepared to give the patches a positive review, provided that William is happy with them.

At least, it's not nilpotent, though that would be quite interesting.
