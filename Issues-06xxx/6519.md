You can find comparisons of the new code and the old code at the bottom of
the site [http://wiki.sagemath.org/WordDesign](http://wiki.sagemath.org/WordDesign). The new code is much
faster.

This patch includes code from Sébastien Labbé, Vincent Delecroix and
myself, so we should all get author credit. (I added all names to the Author
field).

The development took place on the sage-combinat patch server, and the attached patch
is just a folding together and re-organizing of all the relevant patches
from the server. It applies cleanly to sage-4.1 and passes all doctests.

**Partial Review:** I reviewed and documented Vincent's code, to which give a positive
review. I also reviewed Sébastien's code, which also gets a positive review.

Sébastien, can you look over the changes that I made that you haven't yet
reviewed? I guess these are just the changes that I made this past week?
(You can find these changes as four independent patches in the sage-combinat
patches server history.)

Okay, I've factored the offending code out of this patch (once it is fixed,
we will create a new ticket for it), so there should no longer be any
problems. Can you test it again?

Doesn't the date in the deprecation comments need to be updated?

The problem. The picklejar contains objects saved with older versions of
Sage, and since we changed a bunch of things, these older objects don't get
loaded correctly.

The solution. The old word objects use the `WordContent` backend, which
my original patch completely removed (the new implementation is much
better). So my fix was to restore the (`word_content.py` and
`utils.py`); this way, an old-style word can be unpickled, and during
the unpickling, it gets converted to a new-style word, and the user is
given a warning to re-save the word:

```
sage: load /tmp/foo
...DeprecationWarning: Your word object is saved in an old file format since FiniteWord_over_OrderedAlphabet is deprecated and will be deleted in a future version of Sage (you can use FiniteWord_list instead). You can re-save your word by typing "word.save(filename)" to ensure that it will load in future versions of Sage.
word: abbabaab
```
I also added a bunch of deprecation warnings to these files and to the
documentation for these files. 

This is a temporary fix: since the `WordContent` code is not necessary
for any other part of Sage, it will be deleted in a few months. In the
meantime, if there is anyone with some saved word objects, then unpickling
will work.

To make reviewing my fix easier: I've attached the file
`old_pickle_support.patch`, which contains only the changes that I made
to address the pickle issue. This patch has already been folded into o
`trac_6519-words_ng.patch`, so do not apply it.

Besides restoring the files `word_content.py` and `utils.py` (and
adding warnings), I needed to touch `word.py`, so this is where the
reviewer needs to concentrate their attention.

I applied the latest `trac_6519-words_ng.patch` on a clean version of sage-4.1. The following now works :

```
slabbe@slabbe-laptop:~/sage-4.1/devel/sage-words_ng$ sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx"
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx"        
	 [4.9 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.9 seconds
```

I also run sage -t -long on all the sage tree and the only tests that failed are the following :

```
slabbe@slabbe-laptop:~/sage-4.1/devel/sage-words_ng$ sage -t -long "devel/sage-words_ng/sage/interfaces/r.py"
sage -t -long "devel/sage-words_ng/sage/interfaces/r.py"

but those were also broken on my clean version of sage-4.1. Hence, I am giving a positive review to the changes made by Franco to solve the pickle problem.
