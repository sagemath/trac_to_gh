Note:  There are currently two broken doctests in this patch (using the older routine IsPadic Square()), which should resolve themselves once Cremona's patch (Ticket #5834) is applied.

Additional patch to bring QuadraticForm doctests to 100%.

Known Issues:
    Several doctests fail because of the need for hilbert_symbol() to accept rational numbers, and similarly for IsPadicSquare().  These should be addressed by the changes made in Ticket #5834.

So, it turns out there are 4 patches in this series, and they must be applied in order. In particular, patch-3 depends on patch-2, which is at #6037, but I misunderstood that.
The correct sequence is to apply patch-1 in #5954, then patch-2 in #6037, then patch-3 and patch-4 in this ticket.

If that order is followed, the patch sequence applies cleanly to 3.4.1 as well as 4.0.alpha0.

Some doctests were broken on 4.0.alpha0 + patch-1 (#5954) + patch-2 (#6037) + patch-3 + patch-4.

All doctests pass for me when adding on top of that
- attachment:patch-5__QF_reviewer__4.0.alpha0.patch
- patch in #6059
- patch in #6062
- patch in #6064

Note that the `patch-3__QF_misc_doctests__4.0.alpha0.patch` I uploaded earlier is a mistake, just ignore it.
