Interesting.  We have in that function:

        `v = [(mn + j*step, mn + (j+1)*step) for j in range(bins)]`

and then a few lines later:

        `cdef Py_ssize_t j`


That's probably a bad idea.  The cdef line should be above that first line.

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
