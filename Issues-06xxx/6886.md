In #6384, code was introduced to check whether the kernel polynomial provided by the user was valid, by checking that it divides the appropriate division polynomial.

This can be too expensive!  I have been working with isogenies of degree 163 over QQ, for which computing the 163-division polynomial takes many hours.  So I want to introduce a check parameter to the isogeny construction, default True, so that users (or other code) can switch off this check (when they "know" they are right!).

I forgot to add the documentation. The second patch (to be applied after the first) fixes that.

If check is false and a (or several) presumably-torsion points are given, the algorithm does not check if they are really torsion anymore. But it still needs the function .order(). I think we should open another ticket for this.

I have been thinking of a better way of testing the validity of a kernel polynomial, and currently have an idea (not implemented ) which would work in the case of a cyclic kernel.
