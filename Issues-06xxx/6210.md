Hello !!!

It's true that this part's tricky, but what about just saying after 

```
``property`` -- (default: ``lambda x: True``) any property to be tested on graphs before generation
```

Something like "The property must fill an inheritance property to work as intended. Please refer to the help of parameter ``augment``" ?

Otherwise the explanations are given twice and we're sure users will read them `:-)`
