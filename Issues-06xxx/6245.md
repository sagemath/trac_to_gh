For reference, the code is:

```
class infix_operator:
    def __init__(self, function, left=None, right=None):
        self.function = function
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __rmul__(self, left):
        if self.right is None:
            if self.left is None:
                return infix_operator(self.function, left=left)
            else:
                raise SyntaxError, "Infix operator already has its left argument"
        else:
            return self.function(left, self.right)

    def __mul__(self, right):
        if self.left is None:
            if self.right is None:
                return infix_operator(self.function, right=right)
            else:
                raise SyntaxError, "Infix operator already has its right argument"
        else:
            return self.function(self.left, right) 
        	
```

And several examples (doctests?) are:

```
# This emul operator returns the element-wise product of two lists...
@infix_operator
def emul(a,b):
    return [i*j for i,j in zip(a,b)] 
        	
a=[1,2,3]
b=[3,4,5]

# Returns [3,8,15]
a *emul* b 
        	
@infix_operator
def hadamard_product(a, b):
   if a.nrows()!=b.nrows() or a.ncols()!=b.ncols():
       raise ValueError, "Matrices must have the same dimensions in a Hadamard product"
   return matrix(a.nrows(), a.ncols(), [x*y for x, y in zip(a.list(), b.list())]) 
        	
A=random_matrix(ZZ,3)
B=random_matrix(ZZ,3)

The patch is an initial go at this.  The documentation for the function needs to change (it still is just the same docs as the code I followed in plot/misc.py).

Here are some examples:

```
sage: from sage.misc.misc import infix_operator
sage: # A post-fix operator
sage: @infix_operator('or')
sage: def pipe(a,b):
...       return b(a)
...
sage: print (x |pipe| cos)
sage: print pi |pipe| n
sage: print pi |pipe| n |pipe| cos
cos(x)
3.14159265358979
-1.00000000000000
sage: # an infix dot product
sage: @infix_operator('multiply')
sage: def dot(a,b):
...       return a.dot_product(b)
...       
...
sage: vector([1,2]) *dot* vector([2,4])
10
sage: # an infix sum
sage: @infix_operator('add')
sage: def esum(a,b):
...       return [i+j for i,j in zip(a,b)]
...
sage: [1,2,4] +esum+ [3,-1,2]
[4, 1, 6]
```

I only chose a few precedence levels (that's really the issue here).  There's no reason we couldn't put all of the special functions in (like subtract, for example).

The problem is that your `__mul__` function does not check its arguments.  Note that:

```
sage: Fraction(2,3)*matrix(2,1,[1,2])
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense'
object has no attribute 'numerator'
```

Instead, you should check your arguments in the `__mul__` function before blindly calling the .numerator method, or at least you should catch the error, like this:

```
class Fraction:
  def __init__(self, numerator, denominator=1):
    self.numerator = numerator
    self.denominator = denominator
  def __str__(self):
    return "Fraction(%d,%d)" % (self.numerator, self.denominator)
  __repr__=__str__
  def zmul(self, other):
    return Fraction(self.numerator*other.numerator,
                  self.denominator*other.denominator)
  def __mul__(self, other):
    try:
        return Fraction(self.numerator*other.numerator,
                  self.denominator*other.denominator)
    except:
        return NotImplemented

```
