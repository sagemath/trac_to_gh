Moving Notebook to Django will abstract the server and  user authentication, and give us a free admin interface, as well as a large support codebase.

Plan:

* Replace `guard.py` and `avatars.py` with Django user authentication.
* Replace `twist.py` with Django Views.
* Change `run_notebook.py` to launch Twisted as a WSGI container.

By another way, it appears there's a new, event-based server from Facebook called [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/).  I'm not sure yet why they didn't use Twisted.

Replying to [timdumol](#comment%3A13):
> As far as I know, yes, Twisted.web2 does support WSGI. I have only used Twisted.web, though. I was/am under the impression that Twisted.web2 is not supported upstream anymore, and thus we should avoid using it.


True.  We should port the notebook back from Twisted.web2 to Twisted.web.  This will be some significant work but it should get done.

This seems like a relevant ticket to the move to a flask-based notebook.  Well, at least the title is relevant, even if most of the content is outdated now.
