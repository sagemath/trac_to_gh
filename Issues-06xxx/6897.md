Moving Notebook to Django will abstract the server and  user authentication, and give us a free admin interface, as well as a large support codebase.

Plan:

* Replace `guard.py` and `avatars.py` with Django user authentication.
* Replace `twist.py` with Django Views.
* Change `run_notebook.py` to launch Twisted as a WSGI container.

Django migration should help with the ff. issues:

* Streamlined deployment - account management, fewer bugs, etc.

* [Captcha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) for notebook sign-up - [reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/).

* LDAP Authentication.

* Add users as admins. (fprimex)

Doesn't Twisted.web2 officially support WSGI?  That was my naive understanding, though I haven't tested it.   This is a good sign:

```
sage: import twisted.web2.wsgi
sage: help(twisted.web2.wsgi)
    class WSGIResource(__builtin__.object)
     |  A web2 Resource which wraps the given WSGI application callable.
     |  
     |  The WSGI application will be called in a separate thread (using
     |  the reactor threadpool) whenever a request for this resource or
     |  any lower part of the url hierarchy is received.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
```

True.  We should port the notebook back from Twisted.web2 to Twisted.web.  This will be some significant work but it should get done.
