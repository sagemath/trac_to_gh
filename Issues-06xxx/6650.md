It's by design: one of the few places where early on, I explicitly and
deliberately deviated from default python behavior.

In interactive computing, one often ends up having computations that
are known to produce gigantic output, and it's nice to have a simple
way to say "don't print the result of this computation, just do it".
I just checked and it turns out that matlab works this way too (though
I didn't know that at the time, I hadn't tried matlab then):

I rely on this feature quite often, and I consider it a huge annoyance
of the default python shell that you can not suppress output without
making an assignment.

Cheers,

This could certainly be made an option, please file it so we don't
forget about it:


https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython

In the meantime, hack out in IPython's prompts.py file around line 530 or so:

           # do not print output if input ends in ';'
           try:
               if self.input_hist[self.prompt_count].endswith(';\n'):
                   return
           except IndexError:
               # some uses of ipshellembed may fail here
               pass

Just remove that block, and the 'feature' will be gone from your
patched version.

Cheers,

Thanks.   I tried and it seems that site is broken for reporting bugs...  It says:

```
Oops!

Sorry, something just went wrong in Launchpad.

We’ve recorded what happened, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience.

(Error ID: OOPS-1480B921)
