Hi William,

It's by design: one of the few places where early on, I explicitly and
deliberately deviated from default python behavior.

In interactive computing, one often ends up having computations that
are known to produce gigantic output, and it's nice to have a simple
way to say "don't print the result of this computation, just do it".
I just checked and it turns out that matlab works this way too (though
I didn't know that at the time, I hadn't tried matlab then):

I rely on this feature quite often, and I consider it a huge annoyance
of the default python shell that you can not suppress output without
making an assignment.

Cheers,

F

This could certainly be made an option, please file it so we don't
forget about it:


https://bugs.launchpad.net/ipython

In the meantime, hack out in IPython's prompts.py file around line 530 or so:

           # do not print output if input ends in ';'
           try:
               if self.input_hist[self.prompt_count].endswith(';\n'):
                   return
           except IndexError:
               # some uses of ipshellembed may fail here
               pass

Just remove that block, and the 'feature' will be gone from your
patched version.

Cheers,

Thanks.   I tried and it seems that site is broken for reporting bugs...  It says:

```
Oops!

Sorry, something just went wrong in Launchpad.

We’ve recorded what happened, and we’ll fix it as soon as possible. Apologies for the inconvenience.

(Error ID: OOPS-1480B921)
