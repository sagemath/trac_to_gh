Reported by `somos` on `#sage-devel` on IRC

```
<somos> when I do 'sage -optional' it tried to make a temp file in SAGE_ROOT
...
<somos> This is ok if you are running as root user.
...
<mvngu> From the help:
<mvngu> -optional     -- list all optional packages that can be downloaded
<somos> Anyway, the problem is the temp file in SAGE_ROOT.
<somos> It should be in /tmp instead.
<mvngu> Can you explain why it should be in /tmp ?
<somos> Becuase SAGE_ROOT requires root permissions.
...
<somos> So, my suggestion is to avoid the temp file. #1
<somos> If a temp file is needed, I suggest TMP or TMPDIR instead.
