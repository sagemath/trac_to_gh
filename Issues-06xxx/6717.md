Georg S. Weber reported the following doctest failures at this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/5f23ec4032f5e91b) thread:

```
on Mac(Intel) OS X 10.4.11 (XCode 2.5 / gcc 4.0.1 build "5370"), Sage
4.1.1.rc2 builds fine.
However, there are two (reproducible) doctest failures, one known one
and one I never saw before. The known one is:

sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"

1 items had failures:
   3 of  24 in __main__.example_62
***Test Failed*** 3 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.1.rc2/
tmp/.doctest_expression.py
         [73.6 s] 
```
Here is William Stein's suggestion for fixing the above doctest failures:

```
The above doctest should be changed so they don't depend on random hashing,
e.g., change the dicts to lists of sorted tuples. 
```

Yep, this patch does the job, now the doctest does not fail anymore for me.
Although I didn't test on a system, where the test already went fine before the patch, from the nature of the changes, I'm confident, that it will still work.
