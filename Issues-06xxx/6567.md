Currently, the function `primitive_root()` finds a primitive root modulo n. Ticket #6467 proposes to find all primitive roots modulo a fixed n. We should also implement a function to determine whether or not some integer is a primitive root modulo n. A good way is to do this without first having to generate all primitive roots mod n.

Should that be `k-1`?  I'd also put it "# now self..." just to make it clear

Everything else looks nice.  I feel like I want to check the logic for numbers divisible by 2, 3, or 5 but where start > 5 a little more closely (getting late here) but if someone else does that first that is fine.
