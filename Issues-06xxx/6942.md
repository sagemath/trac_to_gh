The following code returns an incorrect result:

```
mm=Matrix(GF(2),[[1,0,1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1,1,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,1,1,1],[1,1,1,0,0,1,0],[1,1,1,0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,0]])
_,S = mm.jordan_form(transformation=True)
S.rank()
```
S should be invertible, so the rank should be 7, but the rank of the above is 5.

Hi Sebastian,

Very nice!

1.  One line in a list indented one-too-many characters.  Fix in reviewer patch for your convenience.  Accept or not.

2.  Most of the linear algebra matrix decompositions return all the pieces, all the time.  I've always thought it inconsistent Jordan form has this `transformation` switch, sometimes returning one matrix, other times two.  Now would be a good time to change this behavior.  But I see that the form is almost a combinatorial routine (once you have the spectrum), while the basis vectors require a whole lot more work, so maybe best not to compute it unless it is asked for?

3.  The list `Vsmall+Y` ends up in a `span()` in the "vector_in_difference" routine.  The span has an `already_echelonized` switch, so I spent a lot of time trying to decide how (or if it was possible) to somehow "keep" `Vsmall+Y` echelonized, since `Vsmall` will start that way.  Couldn't see a reasonable way to do anything too clever, though.

4.  Do you want the 10x10 matrix above for the doctests?  I'd be happy to package it up with the one-character patch.  ;-)

Other than the doctest fix, this is ready to go.  If you want to accept the doctest fix, then go ahead and mark this as "positive review" - everything else is just for your consideration.

Great to see all your good work since the summer, including this.

Rob

Dear Rob,

I am sorry that I am only looking at this again now.  Of course, the reviewer patch looks fine.  Thanks again for reviewing this!  About your other points...

3) Yes, that is a good observation.  I am almost sure that if one looked closer at the linear algebra operations then this code could easily be improved.  There are currently two reasons why I won't look at this, though.  (a) The previous code was broken, so I think it's important to first have something that "obviously" works, in the sense that it is moderately easy to review since the code only uses "high-level" operations.  (b) I've got my first year interview this coming Monday.

4) This is completely up to you.  The matrix looks quite intriguing and more examples certainly couldn't hurt.  Since this ticket will probably be closed soon, if you decide to include this new example, feel free to let me know (via email or sage-devel) and I'll review it right away.

Also, Minh, thank you for picking up the slack and completing the review process!

Kind regards,

Sebastian
