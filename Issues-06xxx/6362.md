singular is last package that don't compile with latest GCC 4.4 for me, it's because of use of strchr function, see GCC 4.4 [porting guide](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/porting_to.html) part "Strict null-terminated sequence utilities" - there is used

char* strchr(const char*, int)

that silently cast-away const, simple explicit cast to char* removes the error during compilation for me so it's trivial to fix. The strchr function in this form is used twice. 

I made spkg that's fixed, wasn't creating patches/spkg for Sage for some time so I ask for strict review even if it's trivial fix :) I tried to remember about everything with spkg creation but something could still slip. There is spkg: ~~[http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.spkg](http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.spkg)~~.

Update:

spkg merged with Martins version: ~~[http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-4-20090620.spkg](http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-4-20090620.spkg)~~, and the
fixed one: http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-4-20090703.spkg

My current attempt is here:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-0-4-20090611.spkg

It needs a fix applied where the ring variables print without a space. Do you want to merge your patch with that SPKG?

<a id='comment:16'></a>I checked the changes (after some tutoring from was and jhpalmieri) against the default package included with 4.0.2, released 18 Jun and against the source included with the spkg.

Is there an error in line 725 of patches/mpr_complex.cc? The original source file src/kernel/mpr_complex.cc contains

```
          sprintf(out,"%s",currRing->parameter[0]);

but the patch contains

```

What happened to the "%s"? I thought that was required.

Everything else looks fine.

Oh, that's something already... but anyway, if I can suggest something, maybe [#6470](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6470) would be better for continuation of this (closed) ticket? It will be better exposed that way I think
