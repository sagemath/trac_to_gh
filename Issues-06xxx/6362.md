singular is last package that don't compile with latest GCC 4.4 for me, it's because of use of strchr function, see GCC 4.4 [porting guide](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.4/porting_to.html) part "Strict null-terminated sequence utilities" - there is used

char* strchr(const char*, int)

that silently cast-away const, simple explicit cast to char* removes the error during compilation for me so it's trivial to fix. The strchr function in this form is used twice. 

I made spkg that's fixed, wasn't creating patches/spkg for Sage for some time so I ask for strict review even if it's trivial fix :) I tried to remember about everything with spkg creation but something could still slip. There is spkg: ~~[http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.spkg](http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.spkg)~~.

Update:

spkg merged with Martins version: ~~[http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-4-20090620.spkg](http://giniu.ravenlord.ws/singular-3-1-0-4-20090620.spkg)~~, and the

I told upstream about this bug and they replied:

We should patch it, but the next Singular SPKG needs a couple of other fixes applied (and updated to 3-1-0-4) this is I guess why it is taking so long.

My current attempt is here:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-0-4-20090611.spkg

It needs a fix applied where the ring variables print without a space. Do you want to merge your patch with that SPKG?

I checked the changes (after some tutoring from was and jhpalmieri) against the default package included with 4.0.2, released 18 Jun and against the source included with the spkg.

Is there an error in line 725 of patches/mpr_complex.cc? The original source file src/kernel/mpr_complex.cc contains

```
          sprintf(out,"%s",currRing->parameter[0]);
```
but the patch contains

```
          sprintf(out,currRing->parameter[0]);
```
What happened to the "%s"? I thought that was required.

Everything else looks fine.

The spkg causes several doctest failures when built on sage-4.1.alpha3:

```
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/quotient_ring.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/quotient_ring_element.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/term_order.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_singular_interface.py # 6 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx # 1 doctests failed

        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/interfaces/singular.py # 10 doctests failed
```

These all seem to be just from the way Singular is printing things, e.g.:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/space/rlm/sage-4.1.alpha3/devel/sage-main/sage/interfaces/singular.py", line 975:
    sage: singular.current_ring()

    //   number of vars : 3

I assume this is nothing major. If someone wants to post a patch, I will gladly finish the review.

also, what about:

```
S = singular.ring('real', '(xx,yy)', 'lp')

vs

```
R = singular.ring('real', '(x,xyy)', 'lp')
```
that looks same when variables are printed without separation?

As contained in Sage-4.1.rc0, singular-3-1-0-4-20090703.spkg does not even build on OS X, neither 10.4 nor 10.5. Changing the line 201 in /src/factory/GNUmakefile.in:

```
factoryobj :=   $(factorysrc:%.cc=%.o) $(factorysrc:%.y=%.o)
```
into the following two lines:

```
factoryobj :=   $(factorysrc:%.cc=%.o)
factoryobj :=   $(factoryobj:%.y=%.o)
```
made the resulting Singular spkg build on OS X 10.4. But after installing it into Sage-4.1.rc0, Sage doesn't even start, it fails with:

```
ImportError: dlopen(/Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.rc0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.so, 2): Symbol not found: ___eprintf
  Referenced from: /Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.rc0/local/lib//libsingular.dylib
  Expected in: dynamic lookup
```
This might be due to the fact that I had dropped in the 3.1.0.2 Singular spkg before, so I am re-running the build from the start. (I doubt that it'll help, but let's see.)

For the record, skipping through the install logs, I spotted another error (this time "copy'n'paste") in the Singular 3.1.0.4 build scripts. In /src/libfac/Makefile.in, the two identical lines 157/158 read:

```
	-$(RANLIB) ${libdir}/libsingfac_g.a
	-$(RANLIB) ${libdir}/libsingfac_g.a
```
and it is obvious from the surrounding lines, that the line 158 should end with "..._p.a" instead of "..._g.a".

`@`Martin:
Would you please report the findings so far upstream?

Oh, that's something already... but anyway, if I can suggest something, maybe [#6470](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6470) would be better for continuation of this (closed) ticket? It will be better exposed that way I think
