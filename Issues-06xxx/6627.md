```
The last 1 in the word disappeared:

```
sage: Word([1,2,1,3,1,2,1]).lyndon_factorization()
(1213.12)
```

Lyndon factorization of the empty word should work.

```
sage: Words('01')('').lyndon_factorization()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration
```

The standard factorization of 321 is 32.1.

```
sage: sage: Word([3,2,1]).standard_factorization()
(321.)
``` 

The standard factorization of the empty word should return the empty word, and not two copies of the empty word. 

```
sage: Words('123')('').standard_factorization()
(.)
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>
This new implementation is correct and also faster.

```
sage: sage: Word([1,2,1,3,1,2,1]).lyndon_factorization()
(1213, 12, 1)
sage: sage: Words('01')('').lyndon_factorization()
()
sage: sage: sage: Word([3,2,1]).standard_factorization()
(32, 1)
sage: sage: Words('123')('').standard_factorization()
()
```

I also changed the repr of the (word) Factorization class to use ',' instead of '.' because otherwise the period is confusing if you factor a long word:

```
sage: WordOptions(truncate_length=10)
sage: tm = words.ThueMorseWord()
sage: tm[:100].lyndon_factorization()
(011, 01, 0011, 00101101, 0010110011..., 0010110011..., 0010110011..., 0010110011, 0)
```
