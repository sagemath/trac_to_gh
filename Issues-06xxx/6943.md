At the present, `@`parallel calls pickle_function() on its argument.  However, the documentation claims that it should work with any callable object.  Additionally, it should be possible to stop computations after a certain amount of time.

This asks for:
 (1) not pickling args, and (2) timeouts. 

#6967 also does both as a biproduct.
