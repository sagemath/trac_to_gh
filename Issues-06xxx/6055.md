The top level README.txt has a few problems reguarding Solaris.

1) It says:

---
  SOLARIS:
     It is reportedly possible, but not recommended yet (see below).
     A fully supported port is planned.

---

But there is nothing below that. 

2) The OS is spelled as Solaris and SOLARIS. Makes searching more difficult. If you must use SOLARIS, then put 'Solaris' in a word close by. i.e, something like:

---
  SOLARIS:
     It is reportedly possible to build Sage on Solaris, but not recommended yet (see below).
     A fully supported port is planned.

Should I close this ticket as a "duplicate" of #9226?

Replying to [@qed777](#comment%3A3):

This should indeed be closed now. It can be considered fixed by #9226 in sage-4.5.2 , though I would not call it a duplicate, as #9226 was created long after this ticket.
