This is a follow-up of #6042. That patch increased doctest coverage in the modular subdirectory from 91.8% to 96.4%. I have finished off the job by doctesting the last few files in sage/modular/modsym, and will upload a patch soon (once I have got a ticket number to put in the patch header, and run full tests on 4.0.alpha0).

Great job.  Applies fine as advertised and all looks very good.

Small point 1: in the preamble to boundary.py there a re  few things nto in math mode which could be (e.g. Gamma1).

Small point 2: is it intended that g1list & ghlist are not included in the reference manual?

I'm giving this a positive review anyway, but if David wants to make further small changes he is welcome.

It looks fine to me ( and I hardly dare suggesting anything else new or David would write a whole book!).

Extra patch applies fine on top of old, and builds (inc. reference html) fine.  And it looks very good (including the two new files now in the ref man).

This patch by itself causes a doctest failure for the pickle jar:

That is without #5080, so there is also the other two failures mentioned above. Note the comment on #5080 causing a significant slowdown in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py.

Sorry, but "needs work" :(

I haven't tried the new patch yet, but the old one caused issues in `sage/modular/modsym/space.py` which were fixed by #5080. Unfortunately that ticket caused a massive slowdown (see David's comment toward the end why), so I cannot merge both tickets due to the slowdown and this ticket due to the failure.

We are about to leave for MSR, so I won't have net access for the next 8 hours or so.

Sounds good as a reasonable stopgap.  

I applied both patches in turn to 4.0.alpha0.  There was this:

```
patching file sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 233 with fuzz 1 (offset -81 lines).
```
which I think can be ignored.  All tests (including long) in sage/modular pass, as does Michael's test of sage/structure/sage_object.pyx.  So I am reinstating the positive review and hoping for the best.
