This is a follow-up of #6042. That patch increased doctest coverage in the modular subdirectory from 91.8% to 96.4%. I have finished off the job by doctesting the last few files in sage/modular/modsym, and will upload a patch soon (once I have got a ticket number to put in the patch header, and run full tests on 4.0.alpha0).

Great job.  Applies fine as advertised and all looks very good.

Small point 1: in the preamble to boundary.py there a re  few things nto in math mode which could be (e.g. Gamma1).

Small point 2: is it intended that g1list & ghlist are not included in the reference manual?

I'm giving this a positive review anyway, but if David wants to make further small changes he is welcome.

This patch by itself causes a doctest failure for the pickle jar:

That is without #5080, so there is also the other two failures mentioned above. Note the comment on #5080 causing a significant slowdown in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py.

Sorry, but "needs work" :(

> Since I gave the earlier patch a positive review I clearly don't know all the tests which need doing -- so Michael, is David's new patch passes your tests it is certainly ok with me.

I haven't tried the new patch yet, but the old one caused issues in `sage/modular/modsym/space.py` which were fixed by #5080. Unfortunately that ticket caused a massive slowdown (see David's comment toward the end why), so I cannot merge both tickets due to the slowdown and this ticket due to the failure.

We are about to leave for MSR, so I won't have net access for the next 8 hours or so.

Cheers,

Michael

Sounds good as a reasonable stopgap.  

I applied both patches in turn to 4.0.alpha0.  There was this:

```
patching file sage/modular/modsym/ambient.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 233 with fuzz 1 (offset -81 lines).

which I think can be ignored.  All tests (including long) in sage/modular pass, as does Michael's test of sage/structure/sage_object.pyx.  So I am reinstating the positive review and hoping for the best.

With both patches applied all tests including the pickle jar pass. The speed regression due to #5080 is avoided since the doctest has been adjusted to not hit the bug, so we are good to go.
