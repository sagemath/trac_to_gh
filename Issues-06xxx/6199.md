    "body": "<a id='comment:5'></a>\nHi Fredrik,\n\nWell, let's not give up hope yet. :) I'll give the full explanation of what's happening with the coercion system below, but first, I want to ask: is there any reason you couldn't just switch to using `sage.integer.Integer` everywhere, or at least in more places? (If you're worried about modifying existing code, the preparser can do the hard work for you, and we can definitely adapt it if needed.) Or, in other words, where are you getting all these Python `int`s from?\n\nAlso, I want to note that there's one more reason to not worry so much: arithmetic on Python `int`s is going to take at least a ~%20 performance hit in Python 3 (at least for the example at the top of this ticket).\n\nHere's what's happening with this code. Every object that derives from Sage's `Element` type goes through the coercion system. It does a lot of things for us: in particular, it makes things like \n\n```\nsage: R.<x> = ZZ[]\nsage: 1/2 + x\n1/2 + x\nsage: parent(1/2 + x)\nUnivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field\n```\nhappen without any hard work on the part of the user, and with a minimal amount of code duplication. So what you're suggesting above does in fact happen: the `__mul__` code ultimately calls into the `bin_op` method of the coercion model (which is itself an object, and has lots of useful methods; try `cm = get_coercion_model()` from the sage prompt), and that checks a few things in order for a multiplication, say `x*y`:\n\n* are the parents of `x` and `y` identical? If so, call the `_mul_` method. (This actually happens in `__mul__`.)\n* have we saved an action of `x.parent()` on `y.parent()`, or vice-versa? If so, apply that. If not, see if we can find one, and use it if we can.\n* can we coerce `x` and `y` into the same parent? If so, do it and then call `_mul_` on the result.\n* some other stuff.\n\nSo what's happening right now is that we're hitting the third bullet, i.e. we end up doing the coercion of the `int` into `ZZ`, as you noted in the ticket description. What I did was write some code that added an action of `int` objects on `ZZ`, which gets picked up in the second bullet above. This is the \"natural\" way to add this kind of thing to the coercion model. The problem is that it's still too slow for what you want: Robert wrote a custom dictionary for storing the actions, but it's still doing work on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds to get called and look it up. For most everything, this isn't so bad, but in your case, it's causing trouble. \n\nNow, that's saying that the \"right\" fix, i.e. use the coercion model the way it's intended, doesn't work out. Of course, that doesn't mean we don't have other options. I just sat down and hacked together a little code that short-circuits things earlier on (just before the second bullet above). It definitely works ... here's before:\n\n```\nsage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = polygen(ZZ)\nsage: a*c\n56088\nsage: %timeit a*c\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.27 us per loop\nsage: %timeit a*y\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 us per loop\nsage: %timeit a*b\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 150 ns per loop\n```\nand after:\n\n```\nsage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = polygen(ZZ)\nsage: a*c\n56088\nsage: %timeit a*c\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 207 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit a*b\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop\nsage: %timeit a*y\n1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.99 us per loop\n```\nIn the case that it's not `Integer * int`, it's one test of a C `int` being nonzero and between two and four extra pointer comparisons on any call to `bin_op`. Mind you, that's going to happen for **every** binary arithmetic operation where the parents aren't identical, which is definitely a hefty price if you live in a world where you don't multiply `Integer * int` very often. I think we could eliminate the C `int` test, if we were crafty.\n\n(Side note: I got a ~10% performance regression on the `a*y` line above between 4.2 and 4.3 -- do either of you have both installed to try it out?)\n\nRobert, what are your thoughts?

Hi Fredrik,

Well, let's not give up hope yet. :) I'll give the full explanation of what's happening with the coercion system below, but first, I want to ask: is there any reason you couldn't just switch to using `sage.integer.Integer` everywhere, or at least in more places? (If you're worried about modifying existing code, the preparser can do the hard work for you, and we can definitely adapt it if needed.) Or, in other words, where are you getting all these Python `int`s from?

Also, I want to note that there's one more reason to not worry so much: arithmetic on Python `int`s is going to take at least a ~%20 performance hit in Python 3 (at least for the example at the top of this ticket).

Here's what's happening with this code. Every object that derives from Sage's `Element` type goes through the coercion system. It does a lot of things for us: in particular, it makes things like 

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: 1/2 + x
1/2 + x
sage: parent(1/2 + x)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```
happen without any hard work on the part of the user, and with a minimal amount of code duplication. So what you're suggesting above does in fact happen: the `__mul__` code ultimately calls into the `bin_op` method of the coercion model (which is itself an object, and has lots of useful methods; try `cm = get_coercion_model()` from the sage prompt), and that checks a few things in order for a multiplication, say `x*y`:

* are the parents of `x` and `y` identical? If so, call the `_mul_` method. (This actually happens in `__mul__`.)
* have we saved an action of `x.parent()` on `y.parent()`, or vice-versa? If so, apply that. If not, see if we can find one, and use it if we can.
* can we coerce `x` and `y` into the same parent? If so, do it and then call `_mul_` on the result.
* some other stuff.

So what's happening right now is that we're hitting the third bullet, i.e. we end up doing the coercion of the `int` into `ZZ`, as you noted in the ticket description. What I did was write some code that added an action of `int` objects on `ZZ`, which gets picked up in the second bullet above. This is the "natural" way to add this kind of thing to the coercion model. The problem is that it's still too slow for what you want: Robert wrote a custom dictionary for storing the actions, but it's still doing work on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds to get called and look it up. For most everything, this isn't so bad, but in your case, it's causing trouble. 

Now, that's saying that the "right" fix, i.e. use the coercion model the way it's intended, doesn't work out. Of course, that doesn't mean we don't have other options. I just sat down and hacked together a little code that short-circuits things earlier on (just before the second bullet above). It definitely works ... here's before:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = polygen(ZZ)
sage: a*c
56088
sage: %timeit a*c
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.27 us per loop
sage: %timeit a*y
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.97 us per loop
sage: %timeit a*b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 150 ns per loop
```
and after:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = polygen(ZZ)
sage: a*c
56088
sage: %timeit a*c
1000000 loops, best of 3: 207 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a*b
10000000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop
sage: %timeit a*y
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.99 us per loop
```
In the case that it's not `Integer * int`, it's one test of a C `int` being nonzero and between two and four extra pointer comparisons on any call to `bin_op`. Mind you, that's going to happen for **every** binary arithmetic operation where the parents aren't identical, which is definitely a hefty price if you live in a world where you don't multiply `Integer * int` very often. I think we could eliminate the C `int` test, if we were crafty.

(Side note: I got a ~10% performance regression on the `a*y` line above between 4.2 and 4.3 -- do either of you have both installed to try it out?)

Robert, what are your thoughts? I know that "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules," and in general I don't like special-casing things. Plus, it's potentially less significant with Py3 on the horizon. But if it's really going to be a showstopper for Fredrik, we should at least think about it more. It's not like there are very many types where the operations are noticeably faster than a few lookups, so it's not opening a loophole that could be abused very much, I think.

If we're going to special case, we could override `__mul__` for Integer directly, rather than stick stuff in `Element.__mul__`. That's "breaking the rules" even more though. Alternatively, we could add a `cdef Element _mul_long(self, long n)` method which is checked for right after the parents aren't the same. This is a bit hackish, but would provide a good avenue for improvements for other types as well (QQ, RDF). Do we need addition as well? (No, I don't think this should be extended to other operands...)

Note that 

```
sage: timeit("a", number=10**6)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 58.1 ns per loop
```

so I wrote my own

```
def time_mul(a, b, long n):
    cdef long i
    for i in range(n):
        a*b
```

With this, I did a special _mul_long method. 

Before:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = RDF(pi)
sage: a*c, a*y
(56088, 386.415896392)
sage: %time time_mul(a,b, 10**7)
CPU times: user 1.13 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.13 s
Wall time: 1.13 s
sage: %time time_mul(a,c, 10**7)
CPU times: user 17.14 s, sys: 0.04 s, total: 17.18 s
Wall time: 17.25 s
sage: %time time_mul(a,y, 10**7)
CPU times: user 8.21 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 8.24 s
Wall time: 8.25 s
```

After:

```
sage: a = 123 ; b = 456 ; c = 456r ; y = RDF(pi)
sage: a*c, a*y
(56088, 386.415896392)
sage: %time time_mul(a,b, 10**7)
CPU times: user 1.16 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.16 s
Wall time: 1.17 s
sage: %time time_mul(a,c, 10**7)
CPU times: user 0.95 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.96 s
Wall time: 0.96 s
sage: %time time_mul(a,y, 10**7)
CPU times: user 8.52 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 8.54 s
Wall time: 8.57 s
```

I'm leaning towards it being worth it, on the right only, for * and + only. The cost is (on my machine) an extra 25ns per non-identical-parents operation, which are at the cheapest is at least 100s of ns.

Thanks for working on this!

In mpmath, there are a lot of loops for fixed-point power series that basically look something like:

```
prec = counter_type(150)
s = t = x = value_type(1) << prec
k = counter_type(1)
while t:
    t = (t*x) >> prec
    t = t*k//(4*k+1)
    s += t
    k += 1
```

Because Python ints are significantly faster than Integers for small values and Integers are significantly faster than ints for large values, it's optimal to use counter_type = int and value_type = Integer. (It's even more optimal to Cythonize the same code, but I'm not there quite yet.) Shift and division were already fixed.

> I'm leaning towards it being worth it, on the right only, for * and + only.


Unfortunately I think it's equally common for the int to be on the left (this can be fixed, but it's hard to track down where it happens). Addition is not as important.

This is actually on MPIR's list of "development ideas"; I think the only reason it isn't supported is that no one has written the code yet. Still, there are reasons to keep using Python ints: ints are a bit faster than custom types because they are special-cased in various places in the Python interpreter, and JITs can optimize them (psyco does a decent job with mpmath partly because of this -- maybe in the future we'll also have Unladen Swallow and PyPy).

It already uses sage.Integer when it's available. 

Since the core is fairly complex (and hence difficult to optimize), I've recently split everything cleanly into "core" and "high level" code. All the high level code can easily use different cores (or "contexts"). There is now both the standard multiprecision context, and a fully working machine-precision context (using float/complex) implemented in less than 300 lines of code. It should be possible to implement a light wrapper of Sage's real and complex numbers in close to 300 lines so that Sage can use all the high-level functions in mpmath "natively".

Still, since Sage's numbers don't provide quite the same features as mpmath's core, it remains necessary to continue optimizing mpmath's core as well. This will eventually have to be done by rewriting more of it in Cython (already a few Cython helper functions are imported from Sage when available). But for now, fixing basic inefficiencies in the present code (such as this issue) seems worthwhile IMHO.
