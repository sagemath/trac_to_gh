sage.combinat.ranker needs improvements:
-  With:

    ```
    sage: f = sage.combinat.ranker.rank_from_list([...]) 
   ```

   f uses `list.index`, and is therefore `O(n)`. This should be made `O(1)` with a hash table.

Further potential improvement (for a later ticket?):

- make the rank / unrank objects produced by this library picklable.

> I'm okay with the hashability as we assume all elements to be hashable


Well, this hashabilitiy assumption was not there before this ticket. So technically speaking that's a backward incompatible change. I agree that in all use cases I can think of, the objects are hashable, so it probably is not a big deal.

>, nor is picklability important to me. However this now makes `rank_from_list` to be the `O(n)` function, and the function itself is not cached.

When `rank_from_list` is called, that's usually with the intention of calling it intensively afterward; in particular the ranker is typically stored in the calling object for all later reuse. At least, that's the case in all the current calls in the Sage library.

Being completely lazy and implementhing `rank_from_list` as a cached function on top of `list.index` would imply an overhead of `O(n^2)` instead of `O(n)` before we reach the limit state where the complexity in `O(1)`; not great. We could introduce some partial lazyness, making sure that the first time an object `x` is looked up, the cache is set for all objects before `x` in the list. What do you think? Is it worth it?

A note: the name `from_list` makes it relatively explicit that the iterable will be expanded anyway.

Cheers,
                          Nicolas

You know that with `@cached_function` instead of a plain dictionary you are building a 2-tuple containg a tuple enclosing the object and an empty tuple?

```
sage: r = rank_from_list(range(10))
sage: r.get_cache()
{((0,), ()): 0,
 ((1,), ()): 1,
 ((2,), ()): 2,
 ((3,), ()): 3,
 ((4,), ()): 4,
 ((5,), ()): 5,
 ((6,), ()): 6,
 ((7,), ()): 7,
 ((8,), ()): 8,
 ((9,), ()): 9}
```

What is wrong with

```
def rank_from_list(l):
    my_dict = {j:i for i,j in enumerate(l)}
    def rank(i):
        return my_dict[i]
```
It is not very clean, but at least cleaner. And also faster by the way.

Ah, good point; I thought our cached functions had a special case for
one parameter functions. Other than that, using a cached function was
mostly a (failed) attempt at having something picklable as well.

So, let's see about speed with various implementations:

```
sage: l = range(100);
sage: d = { x:i for i,x in enumerate(l) }
sage: @cached_function
....: def rank_cached(): pass
sage: for i,x in enumerate(l):
....:     rank_cached.set_cache(i, x)
sage: def rank_dict(x):
....:     return d[x]
sage: rank_dict_getitem = d.__getitem__

sage: cython("""
l = range(100);
d = { x:i for i,x in enumerate(l) }
cpdef int rank_dict_cython(x):
    return d[x]
""")
sage: cython("""
l = range(100);
d = { x:i for i,x in enumerate(l) }
cpdef int rank_dict_cython_exception(x):
    try:
        return d[x]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("%s is not blah blah blah"%x)
""")

sage: cython("""
cdef class RankFromList(dict):
    def __call__(self, x):
        try:
            return self[x]
        except KeyError:
            raise ValueError("%s is not blah blah blah"%x)
""")
sage: rank_dict_cython_class = RankFromList((x,i) for i,x in enumerate(l))
```

Here are the timings, in decreasing order:

```
sage: sage: %timeit rank_cached(50)
The slowest run took 41.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 381 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit rank_dict(50)
The slowest run took 15.56 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 245 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit rank_dict_cython_class(50)
The slowest run took 22.12 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 226 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit rank_dict_cython_exception(50)
The slowest run took 36.63 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 195 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit rank_dict_cython(50)
The slowest run took 31.18 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 191 ns per loop
sage: sage: %timeit rank_dict_getitem(50)
The slowest run took 17.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1000000 loops, best of 3: 173 ns per loop
```

Those timing seem to be consistent from one call to the other. Most of
the time this feature is used with non trivial objects where the
bottleneck is the computation of hash/equality of the objects. So we
don't necessarily need to optimize to the last bit.

In view of the above, the fastest is to return the `__getitem__`
method of the dictionary. The main caveat is that we don't have
control on the exception (a `KeyError` instead of a
`ValueError`). Maybe it is not so bad since a `KeyError` is a special
kind of `ValueError`.

The most flexible is to use a class. In particular, this would make
the ranker picklable (this can be useful: I have had cases where an
object would not pickle properly because one of it's attribute was a
ranker). This also opens the door for reintroducing laziness later
on. It's 30% slower than `getitem` which could be acceptable (I was in
fact expecting a smaller overhead; maybe I missed something in the
cythonization).

What do you think?

Cheers,
                         Nicolas

If pickling is an issue then I would go for `cdef class RankFromList` but with a more appropriated name. It is not possible to set `tp_getitem = tp_call` since the signatures are different.

If you create a Cython class, then please replace the `sage.combinat.words.morphism.CallableDict` with the new one.

Hello,

The final picture looks good. One good thing would be to clean the git history.

The fastest way to create a dictionary from a list is

```
cdef dict d = {x:i for i,x in enumerate(l)}
```
I guess it avoids the creation of the pair `(i,x)`.

The documentation can be more precise

```
No error is issued in case of duplicate value in ``l``. Instead,
the rank function returns the position of some of the duplicates::
```
The rank of the **last value** is returned not just **some**. It would possible to use `PyDict_MergeFromSeq2` to return the first though. But it is not clear to me that it is what we want.

Sided note: I am pretty sure that with #18330 that something better can be done so that `__call__` becomes as fast as `__getitem__` (up to a C function call). But not for this ticket.

Vincent

I hesitated about this; however we are creating a `CallableDict` not a
dict at the end. So using this notation means we are first
constructing a dictionary and then copying it into the `CallableDict`.
This is indeed slightly faster for lists of trivial objects:

```
sage: l = range(1000)
sage: %timeit rank_from_list(l)           # using generator expression
1000 loops, best of 3: 145 ¬µs per loop

sage: %timeit rank_from_list(l)           # using {...}
10000 loops, best of 3: 109 ¬µs per loop
```

But not anymore for lists of objects with non trivial hash/eq:

```
sage: l = list(Permutations(8))
sage: %timeit rank_from_list(l)           # using generator expression
The slowest run took 10.96 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 18.8 ms per loop

sage: %timeit rank_from_list(l)           # using {..}
The slowest run took 10.08 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached 
1 loops, best of 3: 21.7 ms per loop
```

Note that we can hope for the generator expression to be optimized in
the long run when ranker.py will be cythonized.

This is on purpose: I don't want to set this behavior in stone, in
order to leave room for future reimplementations. In any cases it's
explicitly said that this function is meant for lists without
duplicates.

Great!
