After merging the patch `trac_4135.5.patch` at #4135, rebuilding the reference manual results in a warning:

```
WARNING: <autodoc>:0: (ERROR/3) Error in "module" directive:
no content permitted.

.. module:: sage.server.notebook.twist

    TESTS::

    It is important that this file never be imported by default on
    startup by Sage, since it is very expensive, since importing Twisted
    is expensive. This doctest verifies that twist.py isn't imported on
    startup.

    sage: os.system("sage -startuptime | grep twisted\.web2 1>/dev/null") != 0  # !=0 means not found
    True
```
