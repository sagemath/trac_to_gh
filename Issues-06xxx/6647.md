This is a nice addition. I have a question though.

In the docstring for a transversal, you have `Return a list of representatives of the orbit of the given integer in the group.` The usual definition (as one finds for example in wikipedia) is `... given a subgroup H of a group G, a right (respectively left) transversal is a set containing exactly one element from each right (respectively left) coset of H.`.

Hello wdj,

This is one piece i need for strong generating system thus generate integer vector up to action of a permgroup thus invariant theory of multivariate polynomials. The road will be long...

My English is pretty horrible. You're definitely right. I don't really know in which order place my words and that can change the meaning. Here I Think the transversals as Representative of the quotient G/G_{integer} where G_{integer} = subgroup of G which stabilize integer.

The reviewer have to feel free of correcting, susgesting improvement and hiting me for my mistakes.

I would replace `Return a list of representatives of the orbit of the given integer in the group` by 
`If G is a permutation group acting on the set X = {1, 2, ...., n} and H is the stabilizer subgroup of <integer>, a right (respectively left) transversal is a set containing exactly one element from each right (respectively left) coset of H. This method returns a right transversal of G by H.`

However, if this is to be reviewed by applying 6620 and then this patch, I can tell you that I had a problem 
doing that.

Add a strong generating system method.

I really need this method and so, this first implementation is not very good. The data structure (list of list) is dense and perhaps not very adapted (the python list begin at zero and the structure should be in correlation with positions and integer...(Dictionary? , family?, ...) ). This is really not optimized (I am waiting for LinGap...). If it goes in Sage as a first version, one could easily improve it...  
 
Comments, corrections, suggestions welcome!

I've forgotten now the exact problem. I guess hg_sage.apply did not work for me. What does "the sage-combinat queue" mean? Does sage-combinat have their own trac system?

I wonder if this patch was been submitted to the wrong trac system. I guess what the author is saying in some comments above is that the patch is to be applied to the sage-combinat version of sage, not the "standard" version. If that is correct, then either the patch should be submitted t the sage-combinat trac or rebased for the "standard" version. If that is not correct, then a better explanation of why it does not apply to the "standard" sage could be helpful.
