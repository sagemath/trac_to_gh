This is as simple as I can make it at the moment:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1.1.rc0, Release Date: 2009-07-29                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

**********************************************************************
*                                                                    *
* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
*                                                                    *
**********************************************************************
sage: K = Qp(2, prec=5)
sage: P.<x> = K[]
sage: f = P(x^4 + 2^3*x^3 + 2^13*x^2 + 2^21*x + 2^37)
sage: f.newton_polygon()
[(0, 37), (1, 21), (2, 13), (3, 3), (4, 0)]
```

This is wrong, as it's not convex (the point (2,13) should not be there).  Indeed, note that the sequence of Newton slopes is not non-increasing:

```
sage: f.newton_slopes()
[16, 8, 10, 3]
```

This should be [16, 9, 9, 3].

here is a quick patch that should fix the problem

I have not been careful concerning the precision of the coefficients

Needs review !

Actually, I believe that they can't occur but it seemed to be really safer to check them anyway. (I added a comment in the code to mention that.)

I also corrected another bug: the valuation of the coefficients are not the values in the list `self._valadded` but these values augmented by `self._valbase` (as far as I understand David's code). As a consequence, the computation was wrong when the gcd of all coefficients was not 1. I added a doctest to check this issue.
