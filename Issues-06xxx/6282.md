Add the following to the SAGE_ROOT/README.txt, since right now the SAGE_CHECK flag is totally undocumented:

```
If you want to run the test suite for each individual spkg as it is installed, do

   export SAGE_CHECK="yes"

before starting the Sage build.  This will run each test suite, and will raise an error if any failures occur. 
```

The above should be added to step 3 in MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS in the README.txt:

```
    3. Extract the sage source tarball, cd into a directory
       with no spaces in it.  If you have a machine with 
       n processors, say, type  
             export MAKE="make -j4"
       To start the build type
             make
       If you want to run the test suite for each 
       individual spkg as it is installed, type
             export SAGE_CHECK="yes"
       before starting the Sage build.  This will 
       run each test suite, and will raise an error 
       if any failures occur.

The "patch" is just the text in the description, which must be manually added to the README.txt by the release manager who closes this ticket.  Refereeing this means reading the text and making sure there are no typos and that it is not stupid.

By the way, in this part:

```
If you have a machine with n processors, say, type  
             export MAKE="make -j4"
```
should "n" be changed to "4"?
