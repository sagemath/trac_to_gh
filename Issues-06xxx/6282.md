Add the following to the SAGE_ROOT/README.txt, since right now the SAGE_CHECK flag is totally undocumented:

```
If you want to run the test suite for each individual spkg as it is installed, do

   export SAGE_CHECK="yes"

before starting the Sage build.  This will run each test suite, and will raise an error if any failures occur. 
```

The above should be added to step 3 in MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS in the README.txt:

```
    3. Extract the sage source tarball, cd into a directory
       with no spaces in it.  If you have a machine with 
       n processors, say, type  
             export MAKE="make -j4"
       To start the build type
             make
       If you want to run the test suite for each 
       individual spkg as it is installed, type
             export SAGE_CHECK="yes"
       before starting the Sage build.  This will 
       run each test suite, and will raise an error 
       if any failures occur. 
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>By the way, in this part:

```
If you have a machine with n processors, say, type  
             export MAKE="make -j4"
```
should "n" be changed to "4"?
