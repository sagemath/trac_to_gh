As a comment related to trac item 6423, 

*By the way, evidently one can no longer convert I=sqrt(-1) to sympy:*

```
sage: (x+sqrt(2))._sympy_()
x + 2**(1/2)
sage: (x+I)._sympy_()
SympifyError: SympifyError: I is NOT a valid SymPy expression
```

He wanted this, and the other issue reported as TRAC tickets, but was busy writing a talk. 

I don't feel able to comment much more on this, and personally don't intend trying to fix it (outside my knowledge), so I've just reported it.

Can someone else please add appropriate priority, milestones, keywords etc, as this is completely outside my comfort zone.

I vaguely remember William run into this bug recently. It was caused
by switching to the new symbolic, the problem was that passing things
directly to Mul classes in sympy goes in the fast track and only
sympifies easy things like python ints. For Sage integers, a full
sympify must be called, which is what my patch does. The core of the
problem is in fact in sympy cache mechanism, which only does fast
track sympify for performance reasons, so the proper fix is to fix our
cache, which is exactly what we plan to do --- get rid of it,
hopefully by the end of the summer.

We are about to release a new sympy now, so the above patch makes all
sympy 0.6.6 tests pass.
