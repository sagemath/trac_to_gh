```
Get sage-4.0.rc0 from 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/sage-4.0.rc0/dist/

which is stable and has all the new symbolics code in it. 

You can also do:

./sage -upgrade http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/build/sage-4.0.rc0/

Note that the code for symbolics is one big flattened patch.  The only way to referee it is is to read straight through all of devel/sage/sage/symbolics, devel/sage/sage/calculus, and also look at the diff outside of those two directories at the patch to see what else was changed.

```
sage: ((x+y)^9).polynomial(None, ring=ZZ['x']['y']).list()

Some comments after reading the changesets to pynac after the unreleased 0.1.6 version (numbers next to the bullets refer to changesets in the repository from the pynac-0.1.7.spkg file):


* 90:fb6582f9bd81 

 isn't this already handled by the first lines of pyExpression_to_ex() in pynac.pyx?
* 88:25d02eeb427d 

 we should add error checking to py_get_constant() call, we can't guarantee that a constant with the same name will be available between different versions of Sage
* 84:7b3272f4b4bf  is mine, author field lists Mike
* 82:da7d7a220723  evalf for constants using a lookup table

 I already commented on this on IRC and the devel list. ginac/pynac already provides a framework to handle this, I would like to revert this in a future version. My previous message:
 http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/dc46d9d94dd31b5e (scroll to the paragraph below the bullet items)

I will try to prepare a new package which fixes the version numbers of the library and error handling of py_get_constant().

New package which adds error handling for py_get_constant() and changes the library version to 0.1.7 is here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.7-r1.spkg

Changing the version numbers of the library might expose some modules in the Sage library which should be rebuilt when the package is updated. The fix is to add a dependency to the pynac header in module_list.py. I didn't try to see which files need this, since my tree wasn't clean and all the relevant files (sage/symbolic/* is more than enough) got rebuilt for me.

Answering my own comments above, I see that the patch I sent Mike for changeset 84 didn't have hg headers, and returning None from eval or derivative methods is a good trick to halt the evaluation. The evalf function for constants is still as it is, I don't think it's a good idea to introduce big changes at this stage.

Thanks everyone for all the work to make the switch, I still can't believe we're almost there.

Cheers,

I like it!  I quickly read through all of sage/symbolic except for expression.pyx, and attached a patch fixing the issues I found.  Technically somebody else should review sage/symbolic/random_tests.py, since I wrote the original version; but if you do, be sure to review rc0+my reviewer patch, since the reviewer patch adds doctests.

So: positive review for sage/symbolic/* except for expression.pyx (which I didn't look at) and random_tests.py (which I can't review since I wrote it).
