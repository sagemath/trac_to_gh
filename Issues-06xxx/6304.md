I would be OK with the following:

* if somebody tries to use the bernmm algorithm on OS X 10.5, then it gives a warning and falls back to the single threaded PARI version.

* on OS X 10.5 the default algorithm never uses bernmm.

William,

I got the feeling while trying to debug that it could be a compiler issue. The gcc version is 4.0.1 on that box. I've read online that newer versions of XCode for leopard also include gcc 4.2.1, but it's not switched on by default. I couldn't find it on that machine. Would it be possible to try installing apple's newer xcode/gcc to see if that helps?

That's a very good idea.  What happens on your laptop (I assume you can't replicate the issue). 

Anyway, I can't do anything admin-wise on that box until August when I back in Seattle.

I completely built with the latest gcc-4.2.1, and bernmm test still fails.   I've updated the ticket accordingly.  I think the right thig to do at this point is to make using bernmm off by default for OS X 10.5 intel, and put a remark in the docstring that it will sometimes crash sage with an illegal instruction error, and that using the latest XCode with either GCC 4.0.1 or 4.2.1 does not fix the problem.

I am trying to debug again on my laptop (core 2 duo, 2 cores, mac os 10.4.11). If I build bernmm standalone using GMP 4.3.1 + NTL 5.4.2 with default configure options, I can get the test suite to fail quite regularly (bus error) with `./bernmm-test --rational 40000 8`. Interestingly, if I configure GMP 4.3.1 with recommended "maximum debuggability options" (`--disable-shared --enable-assert --enable-alloca=debug --build=none CFLAGS="-m64 -g"`), I can't get it to crash any more.

Finally got somewhere.

It appears to be a stack overflow issue. It occurs inside GMP's xgcd function. The default stack size for new threads is 8 MB on sage.math but apparently only 512 KB on OSX. If I increase the thread stack size inside bernmm, the crashes stop happening.

I wrote a test program (below) that calls `mpz_invert` for a given input size using a given thread stack size. (The `mpz_invert` call is what seems to be causing the problems in bernmm.) I found that for stack size = 512 KB, GMP doesn't have any problems, but if I bump it down to only 448 KB, it starts crashing for inputs of 2800 limbs and above. This is around about the largest size that is used in bernmm for computing B(40000), which is the value of k where problems seem to start occurring. So if bernmm is only using a few 10's of KB of stack, it could push GMP over the limit.

I haven't tried any of this with MPIR, but given that it uses a similar quasi-linear XGCD algorithm, it wouldn't surprise me that the cause is the same.

This is not so easy to address. A band-aid solution is to make bernmm use a bigger stack. The real issue is whether it is reasonable for GMP to require so much stack space for the XGCD operation (or conversely whether the default stack size on OSX is too small). I will ask on the GMP mailing list about this.

I have released bernmm 1.1 which addresses this issue, by providing a THREAD_STACK_SIZE compile-time option. See attached patch.

This doesn't address the underlying issue (that in my opinion, GMP/MPIR uses too much stack space by default for XGCD), but it will have to do for the moment.
