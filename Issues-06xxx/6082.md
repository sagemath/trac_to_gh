When putting objects back into the pool, we realloc the `mpz_t` to a smaller size to be able to reclaim the memory for larger integers. Unfortunately, chopping them to one limb means that they will often need to grow again (even if subsequent arithmetic fits in a limb).

**Attachment:** [6082-integer-speed.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6082/6082-integer-speed.patch.gz)

Now it only reclaims the memory if more than 10 limbs (80 bytes) are used.
