Hello everybody ! I hope this is the last step for this patch to compute the maximum cliques in a graph.
Here is the SPKG file with the source code of Cliquer.
As for planarity or other modules, the original source code of cliquer is copied, but in this case it is copied in local/lib/cliquer-1.2, I was told planarity was to be an exception to the rule.

You can download the SPKG file at this address :
http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/cliquer-1.2.spkg

The vote to include this SPKG can be found here:
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/b24e7c1603b5f988

There is also an accompanying patch, at #5793.

This ticket, plus #5793 and #5669, are all a total mess, IMHO. There are two separate spkg's linked, here and on #5669, and there are two different sets of patches (`11803.patch` is separately 229.4KB and 6.0KB) at #5793 and #5669.

1. Patch names need to be of the form `trac_####-description.patch`.
2. I don't even know which spkg to review.
3. #5793 and #5669 are total duplicates.

My recommendation is to close the other two tickets as duplicates, indicate which spkg to review here, properly format the correct patches to be applied, and post everything here. There's just too much confusion right now.

Nathann -- I would really like to see cliquer included in Sage, so if you need any help getting this in, please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

True, this builds a shared library, but it doesn't seem very portable. The problem is that the code you've written probably works only on systems very similar to yours. For example, when I try building on OS X (32- or 64-bit), I get:

```
ld: unknown option: -soname
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
cp: cannot stat `libcliquer.so': No such file or directory

real	0m2.000s
user	0m0.465s
sys	0m0.190s
sage: An error occurred while installing cliquer-1.2
```

You need to use SCons or some form of autotools as I suggested above, for this to ever be a viable SPKG.

Nathann,

This is great work! However, you are still hard-coding some Linux-isms in spkg-install:

```
scons && cp Build/libcliquer.so "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/"
```

Unfortunately, on OS X, it is `libcliquer.dylib` that is built by SCons. Why don't you copy `Build/*` over, to include all cases? You should also delete the commented part from spkg-install. While I'm reviewing, you need a Mercurial repository in the base directory of the spkg, and the License section of SPKG.txt needs to be clarified (i.e. GPLv2+).

Keep up the good work!

1. You need to check in your changes to the repo!

2. You should add a line to `spkg-install` which copies header files to the right place, something like `cp src/*.h "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/cliquer/"`

3. This is all I can think of, so after this it's a lot of testing on different platforms.

The SPKG at

http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/cliquer-1.2.spkg

doesn't conform to the naming convention for SPKG's. I've renamed it as `cliquer-1.2.p0.spkg` and uploaded the renamed SPKG up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/cliquer-1.2.p0.spkg

As far as I understand, this new SPKG doesn't depend on #5793. So I'm merging the SPKG into the standard SPKG repository.
