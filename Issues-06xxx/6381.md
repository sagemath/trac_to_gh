OverflowError: range() result has too many items
```

It might be better to use xrange, or say that the rank is too big, so the computation would never finish or something meaningful.

On 32-bit it fails in the same place but with a *different* error:

```
...
TypeError: range() integer start argument expected, got sage.rings.integer.Integer.
```
