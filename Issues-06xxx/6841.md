Here are some of rbeezer's comments on sanity checking the key value:

```
23:24 < mvngu-6971> rbeezer: Going back to shift cipher: The callable of 
                    ShiftCryptosystem (i.e. __call__) takes care of converting 
                    any value of key to 0 <= key < alphabet_size.
23:24 < mvngu-6971> rbeezer: Perhaps I should make that clear in the 
                    documentation.
23:27 < rbeezer> mvngu-6971: yes, I see it being Mod'ed, but I think you should 
                 disallow bad keys on input
23:27 < rbeezer> S(29) for "regular" alphabet just churns along, I'd prefer an 
                 error
23:27 < mvngu-6971> rbeezer: New patch coming up... in a hour or so. I'm still 
                    doing some release manage work...
23:28 < mvngu-6971> rbeezer: Thank you *very* much for the valuable feedback!
23:28 < rbeezer> For example with binary strings, my S(5) could have thrown an 
                 error, and I would have had to think about it right then, 
                 instead of looking for a positional shift of 5.  ;-)
23:29 < rbeezer> mvngu-6971: no rush, probably be tomorrow night before I get 
                 to it
23:29 < mvngu-6971> rbeezer: Cool.

Builds and runs on 4.1.2.alpha2.  Passes tests, docs build without warnings.  Great documentation.

Would you want to put similar input protections on `inverse_key()`?  Your call.

Positive review, either way.
