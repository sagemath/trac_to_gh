The main goal of the patch was to add two functions namely `arm_cells` and `leg_cells`. On the way I found several bugs or inconsistencies:

Whereas the various cells methods returns the cells as tuple `(i,j)` Partition.corner used to return them as lists `[i,j]`. I changed them to return tuples. Various methods had to be fixed methods accordingly...

On the way I found that `Tableaux.slide` which uses `Partition.Corner` was modifying it's argument.

Hi Florent,

Thank you for this patch. Here are a couple of comments:

* Please use consistently "in English convention" instead of "in english notations",
see line 840, 963, 924.

* Would it be possible to lift the methods arm_length, leg_length, hook_length, arm_cells, etc also to SkewPartitions? I recently needed those and it would be convenient to have them directly in Sage.

Cheers,

Anne

Except for `cells` which I just added, they are all accessible through `l.outer().arm_length`... So I'm not sure we wan't to link all of those.
