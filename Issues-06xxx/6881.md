Implement the algorithm of John Cremona and Mark van Hoeij for solving conics over fraction fields of polynomial rings.

The article [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/papers/conicFT.pdf](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masgaj/papers/conicFT.pdf) contains references to implementations in Maple (van Hoeij) and Magma (Cremona-Roberts), but these implementations heavily rely on things specific to these systems.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I changed the description to better fit what is already in #727. Besides things that are already in #727, all that I removed from the original description were the following two requests.

1. Use John Cremona's algorithms for finding points on conics over QQ.

It seems that Simon's algorithms (in #727) are better, but that doesn't have to stop us from giving Cremona's code as an option. It is inside mwrank, which is part of Sage. If someone wants to do it, then it can be made into a separate ticket.

2. Getting primes of bad reduction of conics.

This is as good as in #727: make a Conic C. Then do C.determinant().factor()
