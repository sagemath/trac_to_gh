This looks good to me.  One question:  in the line

```
ppart = p**Integer(a).exact_log(p)
```
do you really mean ppart to be the largest power of p which is <= a, rather than the pargest power which divides a?
If so, please change this to "positive review".

Remark:  I have a Magma implementation of an algorithm to determine when a polynomial over ZZ is cyclotomic (algorithm of Smyth and Beukers).  That could be used to extend this function to matrices over ZZ, at least.
