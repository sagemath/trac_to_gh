Currently, the documentation uses a stock jsMath loader script.  This excludes Sage-specific customizations, e.g., the notebook's default jsMath macros.  The patch

* [attachment:trac_6673-jsmath_macros_docs_v3.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6673/trac_6673-jsmath_macros_docs_v3.patch)

inserts the settings via a template when the docs are built.  The patch also sets up a 'sage' HTML theme (cf. [Sphinx docs](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html#creating-themes)) for later customization.

See #4714 for a "notebook" version.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
With the patch, commands like `\ZZ` in the docs appear correctly in the off-line (html+jsmath) version of the reference manual, the tutorial, etc.

Is there any way to generate the list of macros automatically, the way it is done in `doc/common/conf.py` for the LaTeX version:

```
for macro in sage_latex_macros:
    # used when building latex and pdf versions
    latex_preamble += macro + '\n'
    # used when building html version
    pngmath_latex_preamble += macro + '\n'
```
I don't see anything helpful in the Sphinx documentation, unfortunately.  So instead, I'm attaching a small patch to the file `sage/misc/latex_macros.py`, suggesting that if the list of macros there gets changed, the list in `jsmath_sage.js` must be changed also, and I've put a pointer to `latex_macros.py` in `jsmath_sage.js`.

For the file jsmath_sage.js, it looks like a modified version of easy/load.js, but it's not the same as the one distributed with Sage (the one in local/notebook/javascript/jsmath/easy); there are white space differences, and there are differences below the line saying "DO NOT MAKE CHANGES BELOW THIS".  Do I need to worry about this?  Let me know, and if it's not a problem, I can give this a positive review.

Rather inconveniently, I described the patch, briefly, in a [comment:ticket:4714:8 comment] at #4714.  I apologize for not adding some information here.

With Sphinx 0.6.2 (cf. #6586), we might use [static templates](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html#static-templates) to insert the macros on-the-fly.  A test:

* Move `jsmath_sage.js` to `jsmath_sage.js_t`
* Temporarily sandwich the `macros: { }` block between `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}` to placate Jinja.
* Add the comment `// {{ foo }}` somewhere.
* Run `sage -docbuild testreference html -jv3 -S -Afoo=bar`.

I find `// bar` in place of the "`foo`" statement in `_static/jsmath_sage.js`.  In the next few days, I'll try to create a new ticket with a proper patch.

Since we're not there yet, I give the "referee" patch a positive review.

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
The forthcoming alternative patch inserts macros on-the-fly.  It
* Moves `jsmath_sage.js` to `jsmath_sage.js_t` and replaces the list of jsMath macros with a Jinja macro.
* Adds `convert_to_latex_js_math_easy()` to and generates the string `sage_jsmath_macros_jinja` in `latex_macros.py`.
* Includes the string in a command-line option to Sphinx, in `builder.py` [1].
* Adds a trailing semcolon ("`;`") in `latex_macros.convert_latex_macro_to_jsmath()`.

[1] It seems that we can override the templates' default `html_context` dictionary only on the command-line, i.e., with the `-A` option (cf. `sphinx/config.py`).  This means that adding `html_context = <the macros>` in `conf.py` won't work.

Version 3:

* Organizes a 'sage' theme for easier customization.  See `SAGE_DOC/themes/sage/theme.conf` for the settings.
* Uses the theme to avoid passing jsMath macros on the command-line.
* Disables tex2math.
* Subsumes #7204.  In particular, this depends on [SageNB](http://nb.sagemath.org/) version 0.3.2 or later.
* Makes the Sage logo a link to the top-level doc page.  For the doc page itself, the link is to [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/).
* Adds `SAGE_DOC/themes` to `MANIFEST.in`.
* Leaves alone the now empty `SAGE_DOC/templates` and `SAGE_DOC/static`.

Remarks:

* We should add a friendly welcome message to the top-level doc page, e.g., near the top or in the sidebar.

The code looks good.  I've played around with it for a while, and it seems to do what it's supposed to.

Now schilly can get to work modifying "theme.conf" to produce a custom Sage theme...
