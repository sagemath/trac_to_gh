On line 43, the constructor for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)` is

```
43	    def __init__(self, xdata, ydata, options)
```
Currently with Sphinx, any docstring of `__init__` will not be shown in the documentation for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)`. The situation is the same for every class. So one issue to fix is to copy the examples in `__init__(self, xdata, ydata, options)` and paste them within the docstring for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)` after line 32.
