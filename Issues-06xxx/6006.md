This patch also actually implements the height option for the plot3d method of the Point class that the old doctest was actually using through a 3D graphics object.

On line 43, the constructor for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)` is

```
43	    def __init__(self, xdata, ydata, options)
```
Currently with Sphinx, any docstring of `__init__` will not be shown in the documentation for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)`. The situation is the same for every class. So one issue to fix is to copy the examples in `__init__(self, xdata, ydata, options)` and paste them within the docstring for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)` after line 32. Another issue is, the constructor arguments `xdata, ydata, options` on line 43 are not documented in the docstring for `Point(GraphicPrimitive_xydata)`. Constructor arguments must be documented to explain what they are, and how to properly use them.

No, do not do this. It will be fixed in the future. This is still "needs work" due to the other issue.
