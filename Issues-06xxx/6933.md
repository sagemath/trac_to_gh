The title pretty much says it all. The spkg-install is ignoring SAGE64 unless the OS is Darwin (OS X). 

it currently has:

```

if [ `uname` = "Darwin" -a "$SAGE64" = "yes" ]; then
   echo "Building 64 bit OSX version of Sage"
   CFLAGS="-O2 -g -m64 " && export CFLAGS
   LDFLAGS="-m64"
fi

```


Component: **porting: Solaris**
