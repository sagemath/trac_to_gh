When we include Pari's `sum` function via `libs/pari/decl.pxi`, it takes precedence over the default Python one. This causes some rather confusing compiler errors -- see, e.g., this thread:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/68a7bd7e99ef22e6#

The attached patch uses string replace magic to rename it to `pari_sum`.
