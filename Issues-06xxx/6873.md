Observe:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x + 2*y
sage: f.subs(x=y,y=x)
3*y
sage: var('x,y')
sage: f = x + 2*y
sage: f.subs(x=y,y=x)
2*x + y
```


This is really really bad.   Notice in the first and second substitution that the semantics are completely wrong/inconsistent.  The semantics should be as in the second one in both cases. 

If you do `f.subs` in the first case above you'll see at the bottom code using I think libsingular that is really wrong.  Probably the only way to do this right will be to construct a homomorphism and apply it (?), sort of like this:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: f = x + 2*y
sage: R.hom([y,x])(f)
2*x + y
```

This is a dupe of #6482.

I think the fix is to not check whether `b` in `a=b` is a monomial but whether it is constant. If it isn't a constant we should just fall back to `fast_map`.
