I'm using the simple server, and it seems like the logout command doesn't really log you out. From a regular Python (2.6) session:

```
>>> import urllib
>>> def get_url(url): h = urllib.urlopen(url); data = h.read(); h.close(); return data 
... 
>>> print(get_url('http://localhost:8000/simple/login?username=admin&password=xxx'))
{
"session": "515f64ef06471627e1d4a903ee921899"
}
___S_A_G_E___

>>> sess = "515f64ef06471627e1d4a903ee921899"
>>> print(get_url('http://localhost:8000/simple/compute?session={0}&code=2*2'.format(sess)))
{
"status": "done",
"files": [],
"cell_id": 1
}
___S_A_G_E___

4

>>> print(get_url('http://localhost:8000/simple/logout?session={0}'.format(sess)))
{
"session": "515f64ef06471627e1d4a903ee921899"
}
___S_A_G_E___

```

But you can still issue compute commands and have them evaluated. In the same Python session:

```
>>> print(get_url('http://localhost:8000/simple/compute?session={0}&code=3*3'.format(sess)))
{
"status": "done",
"files": [],
"cell_id": 3
}
___S_A_G_E___

9

```
In the LogoutResource class of twist.py, I see that we quit the worksheet and remove all the cells, but it's retaining some state -- note above that after we logout, the next compute command uses  cell 3. You never explicitly remove "session" from the sessions dictionary; is that something that should be done?

The "further-stuff" patch removes the nodoctest, since the file does pass doctests. It also adds the server to the reference manual and improves the documentation a bit. It doesn't have anything to do with fixing the issue in this ticket, but while we're there, we might as well fix some things up.
