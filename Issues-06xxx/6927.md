The CachedFunction class is a wonderful decorator that provides caching of computations, unique rings, etc.  However, for any number of databases, it would be useful if the computed data was to persist between sessions.  So, we should extend the CachedFunction class to enable disk caches, too.

Comments on the first patch:

```
yo
[4:32pm] williamstein:
Do you break pickling?  I'm curious.
[4:32pm] williamstein:
that lambda scares me.
[4:32pm] williamstein:
You could do: "stringify = lambda k: arguments_to_string(f,k) "
[4:33pm] williamstein:
via a partial function evaluation object (which is also somewhere in Python -- see ref guide) and avoid the lambda whilst making sure to not break pickling.
[4:33pm] williamstein:
Pickling would of course only be an issue if you generalize this to methods of a class.
[4:33pm] williamstein:
Oh, it could also be a problem if you say combine this with @parallel and multiprocessing.
[4:33pm] williamstein:
Have you tried that?
[4:34pm] williamstein:
boothby_ -- ping
[4:34pm] williamstein:
I don't like this: "if isinstance(cache, FileCache) and clear_disk_cache_too != 'yes I mean it':"
[4:34pm] williamstein:
It needs to be broken down a little more so that one gets an error if clear_disk_cache_too is true but not that string.
[4:35pm] williamstein:
As is, it is undocumented and you would never know how to use it without reading the source.
[4:36pm] williamstein:
the empty line 560 should be deleted, I think.
```

I'm not sure if this problem is local to this patch, but running:

```
@cached_function
def oddprime_factors(n):
     l = [p for p,e in factor(n) if p != 2]
     return len(l)
oddprime_factors.precompute(range(1,100), 4)
```

, which is in the doctets of `cachefunc.py`, in the Notebook throws a `NameError`:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/deadlyx/.sage/sage_notebook/worksheets/admin/0/code/1.py", line 13, in <module>

  File "", line 1, in <module>

  File "/opt/sage-bin/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/processing/pool.py", line 470, in next
    raise value
NameError: global name '_sage_const_2' is not defined
```

Running it in the command line works perfectly.

* The paths for `FileCache` are not OS agnostic: Windows uses backslashes, instead of slashes. Using `os.sep` instead should fix it.
* The examples in the docstrings are not properly formatted. To display them as a code block, please use the ff. format:

```

EXAMPLES::

    sage: foo()
    bar
    sage: bar()
    baz

:: # Another code block

    sage: foo()
    foo

```

Everything else seems to work well. Oh, it may be worth hashing the function being cached and adding that to the key. It should prevent problems with using the same directory for the cache folder.

This patch should fix the issues regarding the docstrings. The NameError is due to the implementation of `@`parallel. I am not sure if it is feasible to fix the error. In any case, this is orthogonal to this patch. Positive review so far as I can do.

Can anyone review the referee patch?

I've attached a combined, rebased patch.  I've removed

```python
        return P(arglist) 
```
from the "ref" patch.  Otherwise, the precomputed values are not cached.  Or am I mistaken?

I've also relocated

```python
from sage.structure.sage_object import save, load
```
to avoid a circular import problem with `sage -docbuild reference html -j`:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/apps/sage/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 11, in <module>
    from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
  File "/home/apps/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/misc/cachefunc.py", line 20, in <module>
    from sage.structure.sage_object import save, load
  File "/home/apps/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    import dynamic_class # allows for sage.structure.dynamic_class?
  File "/home/apps/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/dynamic_class.py", line 119, in <module>
    from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method, cached_function
ImportError: cannot import name cached_method
```

To the extent it counts, my review is positive, but someone should check the combined patch.
