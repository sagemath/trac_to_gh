In new symbolics, ratio of two symbolic expressions involving derivative does not simplify

```
sage: f(x) = function('f', x)
sage: g = f(x).diff(x)
sage: h = f(x).diff(x)*sin(x)
sage: h/g
sin(x)*D[0](f)(x)/D[0](f)(x)
```


However, for some ordering it does simplify

```
sage: f(x) = function('f', x)
sage: g = f(x).diff(x)
sage: h = sin(x)*f(x).diff(x)
sage: h/g
sin(x)
```
