Are these mathematically equivalent? It seems to me the factor in the numerator has changed from (2*i2) to (2*i2-1) and denominator from 2 to 1. That seems a different result to me. 

I tried what I **think** the test is doing in Mathematica and got:

```
In[7]:= f=Log[Sin[x]/x]

            Sin[x]
Out[7]= Log[------]
              x

In[8]:=  Series[f,{x,0,12}]

          2    4      6      8       10           12
        -x    x      x      x       x        691 x           13
Out[8]= --- - --- - ---- - ----- - ------ - ---------- + O[x]
         6    180   2835   37800   467775   3831077250

In[9]:=
```

I've no idea what's right or not.
