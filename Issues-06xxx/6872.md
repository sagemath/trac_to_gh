The module `sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx` is currently not in the reference manual. After adding it to the reference manual and (re)building it, you get something like that shown in the screenshot `trac_6872-without-patch.png`. Notice the redundant colon ":" after "ALGORITHM". Now supposing you leave "ALGORITHM::" alone and move "Uses Singular via libSINGULAR" to a new line. Building the reference manual would result in a warning:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.so:docstring of sage.libs.singular.groebner_strategy.GroebnerStrategy:8: (WARNING/2) Literal block expected; none found.
```
But removing the redundant colon and the documentation builder is now happy. Hence the patch `trac_6872-fix-typo.patch`.
