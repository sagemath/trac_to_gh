In a %latex cell I couldn't use any accentuated letter. I had to write \"o to get รถ.

Using this patch I can write unicode characters directly. For example Hungarian chars:

This feature is important because most of the world uses more than the first 128 characters of ANSII.

Looks good to me except that it doesn't pass doctests.  Apply the patch at #6434 and you're good to go.

So this patch depends on #6434; modulo that, positive review.

As my comment says, doctests don't pass until you apply the patch at #6434.  Once #6434 gets in, this one is ready to go.  Is there some way to label this besides "positive review" to indicate this?
