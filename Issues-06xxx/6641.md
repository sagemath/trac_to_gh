The current implementation of antichains must construct the complete set of antichains, but it can be done via an iterator (using the `GenericBacktracker` class).

I have a patch that I will post shortly.

A slowdown might be acceptable if there's a big win in code clarity, memory use, ease of doctesting, etc, but I'm not sure we get any of that, except maybe the memory usage. Thoughts?
