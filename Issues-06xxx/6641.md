The current implementation of antichains must construct the complete set of antichains, but it can be done via an iterator (using the `GenericBacktracker` class).

I have a patch that I will post shortly.

I've done a bunch of testing, and this patch is consistently 30-50% slower than the current code. For some things, it was only about 15-20% slower, but mostly it's 30-50%. Here's what I tested:

A slowdown might be acceptable if there's a big win in code clarity, memory use, ease of doctesting, etc, but I'm not sure we get any of that, except maybe the memory usage. Thoughts?
