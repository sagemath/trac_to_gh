The current implementation of antichains must construct the complete set of antichains, but it can be done via an iterator (using the `GenericBacktracker` class).

I have a patch that I will post shortly.

For the record, I took the recursive algorithm that is currently used and did very minor adaptations to be able to use it with the backtracker code.

The main advantage to using the backtracker code is that you get an iterator instead of a list.
