The current implementation of antichains must construct the complete set of antichains, but it can be done via an iterator (using the `GenericBacktracker` class).

I have a patch that I will post shortly.

I've done a bunch of testing, and this patch is consistently 30-50% slower than the current code. For some things, it was only about 15-20% slower, but mostly it's 30-50%. Here's what I tested:

* antichain posets 5 and 10 elements

A slowdown might be acceptable if there's a big win in code clarity, memory use, ease of doctesting, etc, but I'm not sure we get any of that, except maybe the memory usage. Thoughts?

Thanks for running the timings. That is a significant difference. I agree that this should be marked as needs work.

For the record, I took the recursive algorithm that is currently used and did very minor adaptations to be able to use it with the backtracker code. So the backtracker code seems to be adding a lot of overhead in this case. The best way to proceed would be to better adapt the recursive construction.

The main advantage to using the backtracker code is that you get an iterator instead of a list.
