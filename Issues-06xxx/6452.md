This ticket add some support to submodules of `(ZZ/mZZ)^r` (e.g. containment, iteration). There is no new algorithm, we just use the code available for submodules of `ZZ^r` and the Schmidt normal form of integer matrix.

Is there any way we can get documentation for the cdef methods as well as possibly some more code comments?  I'm just worried that there's no one who is able to maintain this code.

Also, it's not clear to me that there are not memory leak issues with this code as there are lots of malloc's and only one free.

As I said, I could try to add comments to the code, but I really don't know cython
nearly well enough to deal with malloc issues.

I've emailed Cesar and not gotten any response about the memory leak issues.

Given that, should the status change to "resolve as won't fix"? That would be too bad since Sage could really use "linear codes" over rings.

I'm not particularly fond of this patch, I must admit. It doesn't seem very well thought out. I prefer not putting in code which is weak and not thought through, rather than superficially being able to claim that "Sage can do codes over rings". For instance, what can the code actually do right now, besides computing the list of codewords?

Some concrete complaints:

* `gen_mat` should (nowadays) be `generator_matrix`.
* The class has many non-hidden-but-actually-private-and-stupidly-named fields
  `self.codeSet`, `self.minimum`, etc. They should be renamed and start with an underscore.
* `next(self)` is not the way we implement iterators, AFAIK.
* The name `RingCode` is not sensible, since only `ZZ/mZZ` is supported.
* The mathematical object of such a code is a free `ZZ/mZZ` module. Shouldn't
  this be reflected by some parent/category magic in `__init__`?
* `__latex__` is wrong: it says "Linear code".
* English is bad in some texts, e.g. for `length()`, a "the" is missing.
* What's the point of `spanning_codewords`? The nomenclature is not used in
  `LinearCode`, and function just returns the rows of the generator matrix
  anyway.

On a broader design level: I dislike that tons of computation is done at `__init__`, in particular tabulating all codewords. In coding theory stuff that I have been involved in, we have tried very hard to postpone computation until it becomes necessary. In particular, construction should be cheap.

For instance, I think that e.g. the cardinality of such a code can be relatively easily computed without tabulating the entire code.

The design of ring codes should also think the new (well, almost-accepted) `Encoder` and `Decoder` structure into it: #18376, #18813.

Note that I did not run or test the code -- I just looked at it.

Nothing I guess. But it is already something and it seems to be done efficiently.

Nope. It is not necessarily free. The submodule of `(ZZ/4ZZ)` generated by `2` is **not** free.

True. It would basically be equivalent to implement a generalized echelon form for matrices over `ZZ/nZZ` that give you a "pseudo-basis" of submodules of `(ZZ/nZZ)^r`. I have no idea where to find such algorithm.

The tests do not pass, but at least some examples run just nicely. Moreover, there was at least one person interested. This is why I thought it would be worse to make it a branch.

I don't think that it is enough to determine the structure. An example of a problem is if `R=ZZ/4ZZ` and a matrix of the form

```
2 * *
0 2 *
0 0 2
```
If you have a vector which is a sum of its row with coefficients `0` or `2` then the leading coefficient vanish... and you lose the nice Hermite form!

But I guess that the Smith normal form would be of more help. If I intrepret correctly what I read, it tells you that any submodule of `R^r` where `R = ZZ/nZZ` is actually of the form `R / (I1) + R / (I2) + ... + R / (Ik)` for some ideals `I1`, ..., `Ik`. These ideals are basically the product `SAT` (which is diagonal) and the decomposition is explicitly given by `T` (my source and notations from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_normal_form)).

> All right, I will try to do something. I had a more careful look at the code (and the corresponding master thesis) but I was not able to understand anything. With the Smith form it will also be straightforward to implement a (possibly very efficient) iterator over the elements of the module.


Nice, I didn't consider that.

> One non trivial point is to decide equality of sub-modules. The only canonical part of the Smith form is the diagonal matrix (which only gives you a hint about isomorphisms between submodules). But I guess that we can somehow echelonize the part corresponding to a given ideal. I would be much more happy with a clean reference...

Such a ticket would definitely make sense. And it seem to cover most of the functionality here (I mean, the minimum distance is right now just exhaustive checking distances...)

The distinction between vector subspaces and linear codes (given only by their generator matrix) is right now that the latter exposes a list of specialised coding theory functions. Such functions might be interesting for non-coding theorists, but probably won't be. That's an argument for having a special class which basically just wraps vector subspaces. Exactly the same argument could be made for submodules of `(ZZ/nZZ)^r`. But no need to get ahead of ourselves here, though...

A different matter: the current patch is Cython. Do we want that? I remember Jeroen's advice to always try Cython only after you have determined that you really need the performance, and that Cython will give this to you.

Most of it will be in Python. Only the iterator can possibly be in Cython and it should not be more than 20 lines of code. But it makes sense to do it in a second time.

Great work Vincent!

Just to be sure: is this "In review"? You made many changes but didn't change the state of "needs review".

I will look at it in detail later, and when I'm sure it's ready. But in any case, some preliminary remarks:

- Could you explain to me (reviewer) the reason for the patch in the category
  files? Something with you using the `Facade` in a previously unthought case.
  Is this related to the `Free`-thing below?

- `FreeModule_ambient_IntegerModRing.span` never uses its `check` argument.

- Since you compute the smith form at construction, then construction is expensive even when nothing is asked of the object afterwards. Is the argument for this that nothing interesting can be said about the module without computing the smith form anyway? Generally, I like construction to be cheap and postponing computation till the user asks it.

Generally, it looks pretty good though.

Hi,

Replying to [jsrn](#comment%3A29):
> Great work Vincent!


Thanks ;-)
 
> Just to be sure: is this "In review"? You made many changes but didn't change the state of "needs review".


It is in needs review. After the first commit, it appears that one doctest failed. And then, I found many typos and some better conventions. This is why there are so much commits afterwards. Shortly: it is ready and in needs review.

> I will look at it in detail later, and when I'm sure it's ready. But in any case, some preliminary remarks:
>

Nope. There is no `TestSuite(U).run()` anywhere for submodules. And this is the reason why.

A facade is a concept from the Sage category. A parent is a facade if its elements do not belong to itself, as for submodules

```
sage: F = FreeModule(ZZ,2)
sage: U = F.span([F((3,0))])
sage: U.an_element().parent() is U
False
sage: U.an_element().parent() is F
True
```
So `U` is a **facade** for `F`. But this is currently not properly done

```
sage: U in Sets().Facade()
False
```
I did it for the submodules over `ZZ/nZZ`. I will fix it later on for the other base rings as well and add some `TestSuite`.

There are many generic tests in category (that are automatically run with the `TestSuite` thing) but some of them do not care about facades. In particulal the `_test_zero` and `_test_one` that I modified.

> - `FreeModule_ambient_IntegerModRing.span` never uses its `check` argument.


True. I did it for compatibility with the other `span` functions. Maybe I could remove it.

> - Since you compute the smith form at construction, then construction is expensive even when nothing is asked of the object afterwards. Is the argument for this that nothing interesting can be said about the module without computing the smith form anyway? Generally, I like construction to be cheap and postponing computation till the user asks it.


Without this nothing can be computed (number of generators, cardinality). Note that I postponed the `_lift` argument computation.

Now, no worries about facades... they do not appear anymore. Needs review again.
