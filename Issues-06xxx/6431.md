<a id='comment:4'></a>No, the problem is that `PowerSeriesRing._element_constructor_(self, f)` does not currently accept Laurent series.  Here is another example:

```
sage: L.<q> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: P = L.power_series_ring()
sage: P(q)
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: Unable to coerce q (<type 'sage.rings.laurent_series_ring_element.LaurentSeries'>) to Rational
