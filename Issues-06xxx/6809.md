I'm done reviewing this patch. It is good upto a small detail: the code access to a private attribute. I've added an accessor method. 

I just uploaded a new version of the patch after review which add a is_optional method for better encapsulation (as suggested by former comment in the code).

Nicolas: please add a positive review when you finished reviewing my changes.

Cheers,

Florent
