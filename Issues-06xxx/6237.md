And if you run it with just `roots(CDF)` you get nine different occurrences of (0, 1), i.e. root 0 with multiplicity 1.

The attached patch fixes this.

This is fine overall, assuming the answer to the following question is yes.

```
            if output_complex:
                rts = sort_complex_numbers_for_display([L(root) for root in ext_rts])
            else:
                rts = [L(root.real()) for root in ext_rts if root.imag() == 0]
```
The first list gives a canonical ordering, so using 

```
                rts_mult.append((rt, mult))
                j += mult
```
is okay, it won't append the same thing twice.  Is that also true for the second list?  I couldn't come up with an example that breaks it, but that just means I don't know much about how polynomials are represented internally.  At any rate, it should probably be ordered, just to be on the safe side, if you use that way of finding multiplicities.  Does Pari not compute multiplicities for this?

Thanks for catching this.

From Pari's documentation for the function we're using:

```
polroots(pol,{flag = 0})

complex roots of the polynomial pol, given as a column vector where each root is repeated according to its multiplicity. [...]

The algorithm used is a modification of A.SchÂ¨nhage's root-finding algorithm, due to and implemented by X.Gourdon. Barring bugs, it is guaranteed to converge and to give the roots to the required accuracy.
```

There is no mention of the roots being sorted.  I guess I could read the source code and find out, but I like you suggestion of sorting the Pari output anyway -- just in case they change the behaviour in the future.

Also from the above snippet, Pari indeed does not give the multiplicities, it just repeats each root the correct number of times.

I will replace the patch soon.

Did you try the whole thing, including `pari('v')` and `pari('u')` ?

It seems to work for me.  Of course, if I had written the example I would have tried something like

```
sage: R.<u> = QQ[]
sage: S.<v> = R[]
sage: f = v^3 - u^7 + 2*u^3*v
sage: f.discriminant()
```

This does indeed fail with a `PariError(8)`.  And this is apparently documented in the docstring for `discriminant`.  It's a shame that it doesn't work out of the box.  In fact, I would even like something like the following to work:

```
sage: R.<u, v> = QQ[]
sage: f = v^3 - u^7 + 2*u^3*v
sage: f.discriminant(v)
```

Anyway, it's beyond the scope of this ticket.  I might open an enhancement ticket about it.
