This patch could possibly depend on #6745.

The goal of this patch is to implement computation of the ternary quadratic form associated to an order in a rational quaternion algebra.  These are useful, e.g, in computing with Heegner points, in decided whether quaternion orders have embeddings from orders in quadratic imaginary fields, and in computing elements of the Kohnen + subspace of modular forms of weight 3/2.

Looks good to me:  applies fine to 4.1.1, tests pass, some examples I tried looked correct (as does the code).

There's one small typo ("had" for "has" in the docstring) which I put into a second patch (overkill perhaps!)
