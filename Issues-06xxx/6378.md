A few features would be nice to add to sage -merge:

1. Ask all questions at the start instead of between tickets (that way, the user can kick off the process and just wait until it finishes, instead of having to check back every 20 minutes)
2. Display comments with the patches

Also, sage -merge doesn't properly handle the '-a -f' combination.  Fix that.

<a id='comment:7'></a>I'm generally happy with Tom's changes. In fact, one should note that no patch of his needs merged -- these changes are already live in sage 4.1 and 4.1.1. Looks like someone's been editing trunk. (`*tsk tsk*`)

My referee report comes in the form of two new patches, one for the bin repo, and the other for the main repo. The change to the main repo is tiny -- it's just changing `sage/misc/hg.py` to use the new `subprocess` module instead of `popen3`, because the deprecation warning is annoying to see in the output of `sage -merge`. I could easily be convinced to move this to a new ticket, if people would prefer that. 

The patch to the bin repo does the following:

* remove a dirty hack involving `tee` by using python's `subprocess` module
* add a few comments about the hackish parsing of trac pages
* use `urllib2` to parse urls
* be (unnecessarily?) pedantic about `os.path.join` instead of explicit use of `/`
* clean up some spacing and indentation issues
* add an option to e-mail when a run of `sage -merge -a` finishes

I ran some tests, but I didn't do any exhaustive testing on `sage.math`, which should probably be done. (I'm currently on vacation, and without good internet access.)

```
Usage: sage -merge <ticket_number>
For more advanced usage, see the file /home/john/sage-4.1.1/local/bin/sage-apply-ticket.
```
then as well as finding something human-readable in that script file, there could be more usage instructions in (say) the reference manual.

That should go for all the other command-line options, of course: a sort of "man sage"-type output.

Anyway, adding a reference to wiki.sagemath.org/release would already be useful!

Meanwhile(?) http://wiki.sagemath.org/release appears to be a dead link.

http://wiki.sagemath.org/devel/ReleaseManagement is all I've found.

The patch to the main Sage respository is unneeded now, as it's been fixed already by sage-4.4.alpha0. The patch to the scripts repository works fine, except for the email part. It doesn't get the mail argument. Calling it with, say,

```
sage -merge -a -e timdumol@gmail.com
```

results in an error after merging everything, stating that the email address, which is the null string (''), is invalid.

This patch rebases it on #8712, while adding the requested documentation. This seems to detect the email argument.

Hmmm, I'm ok with John's new help messages, but when will more return codes be tested?

I can't tell if this ticket is that urgent s.t. we should postpone such to the follow-up.

At least there is already one... (#9319) ;-)
