[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) is a problem tracker for software projects.  For example, see here.

The latest available Trac spkg is [old](http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/).  Version [0.11.5](http://trac.edgewall.org/browser/tags/trac-0.11.5/RELEASE) may include several new features, either [built-in](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracGuide) or  [added-on](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/PluginList) ([more plug-ins](http://trac-hacks.org/)).  Moreover, we can use the spkg to test potential improvements to [Sage trac](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac).

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/257b1e92d98c40d7/724cc866319332a0?#724cc866319332a0) for a discussion of requested features and potentially useful plug-ins.

The new spkg and accompaying patch:

* http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mpatel/trac/6928/trac-0.11.5.p0.spkg
* [attachment: trac_6928-trac_spkg.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6928/trac_6928-trac_spkg.patch.gz)

Easy setup for [Mercurial repository browsing](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracMercurial):

* `sage -f trac-0.11.5.p0.spkg`
* `sage: trac(easy_setup=True, open_viewer=True)`

Please see `SPKG.txt` or the patch for help on creating user and administrator accounts.

See [TracPlugins](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins) for ways to sample plug-ins.  Here's one way, roughly:

* Download `plugin.zip` from a plug-in's page.
* `unzip plugin.zip`
* `cd plugin/` 
* `cd 0.11/` (if necessary; `0.11` here matches the Trac version)
* `chmod u+rw,go+r -R *` (if necessary)
* `sage -python bdist_egg`
* `cp dist/plugin-ver-py2.6.egg $SAGE_ROOT/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage_trac/plugins`
* Restart the Trac server in sage.

Note: Plug-ins installed in this way --- directly to a project's `plugins` directory --- are automatically enabled, but the plug-in may still require configuration in `sage_trac/conf/trac.ini`.  See the plug-in's home page for details.
