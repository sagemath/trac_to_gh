LARGE GRUMBLE.

Was it really that urgent to integrate this in????? 

I said I was going to handle it.

Now I again need to rebase the category code + work around the compatibility in the sage-combinat patches.

Alex had asked explicitly whether this should wait for the category code to be merged.

Oh well.

Btw: other than that, I truly appreciated the hard work you did put into making this release happen!
