```

This applies cleanly to 4.0.rc2 and passes doctests.  It looks good to me, but someone with a better overview should decide whether to merge it or just wait for the new category code to be merged.

LARGE GRUMBLE.

Was it really that urgent to integrate this in????? 

I said I was going to handle it.

Now I again need to rebase the category code + work around the compatibility in the sage-combinat patches.

There wasn't any comment on the ticket saying that it shouldn't be merged.  It had a positive review and fixed a bug that someone actually encountered.  I guess I'm just so used to rebasing things that I don't think anything of it.  Sorry about that.

Alex had asked explicitly whether this should wait for the category code to be merged.

Oh well.

Btw: other than that, I truly appreciated the hard work you did put into making this release happen!
