In a discussion with David, we realized that he's been using "method" for "algorithm" in several places. This fix will follow up on #5701, and will probably depend on the patches there.

It is also *not* the standard arg name. If you think method is better, take it to the mailing list.

Actually, neither did I. But when David and I did a search for "method=", most of what we found were places where he was using that name.

In fact, here is a complete (I think) list of the functions which use this (4.0.alpha0):

```
calculus/desolvers.py: eulers_method, eulers_method_2x2
coding/decoder.py: decode
coding/linear_code.py: decode, is_permutation_equivalent, permutation_automorphism_group, spectrum
finance/easter.py: easter
combinat/designs/block_design.py: ProjectiveGeometryDesign
combinat/designs/covering_design.py: __init__, method
combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py: dual_incidence_structure
groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py: as_permutation_group, module_composition_factors
schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py: frobenius
matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx: exp
matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.pyx: _rank_linbox
rings/polynomial/polynomial_compiled.pyx: __init__
```

I wrote a new patch which uses the decorator mentioned above. **This patch assumes applying the patch for Trac #9907!**

I basically rewrote the patch, so it works for Sage 4.5.3 (accidentally wrote 4.5.1 in the patch message).

I also did a grep on all Sage source which uncovered more places where method should be replaced with algorithm (I assume). I also changed the doc-texts to refer to "algorithms" instead of "methods" for the relevant functions changed.

Hope I can get a fast review on this; I plan to do major relocations to the coding theory library soon, and this trac touches a lot of code in a lot of places :-)

Cheers,
Johan

Decorator complaint is bigger than these tickets.  Its on sage-devel.

sage -tp 4 devel/sage yields:

```
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/padic_lseries.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/misc/sagedoc.py # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx # 1 doctests failed
```

which are all reproducible on my machine.

First is an easy fix, extra deprecation warning in a doctest elsewhere when using `frobenius()`.

Second is just me.  I nuked all my documentation while testing the new color scheme.  Ignore it.

Third looks like something is pickling the two decorators and once they get moved the pickle breaks, so maybe this really belongs on #9907?  Complaint follows.  Parts look mysterious to me, other parts look like they involve these decorators.  It could be a false alarm from my development setup.

No problem.  Just holler if you want to learn some new ropes.

> sage_object.pyx also fails on my machine -- don't know how I missed that when testing. I'll look into that and your sage-devel thread.

If you see how to contribute to the sage-devel thread, that would be great.  But don't let it delay this.

Pickling is a rat's nest.  #9907 is well-intentioned, but not strictly necessary.  You may not want this to depend on it?  In other words, can you proceed without the move and the fix for classes?  You really just want to ultimately do coding theory, right?

I'm also interested in cleaning up and improving Sage ;-) But you're right. This opened up a can of worms, I didn't expect. I've created a new Trac #9919 for making the workaround mentioned in #9907 general by patching sage_wraps. Then I can make this patch depend only on #9919. The future of #9907 can then be decided later (the current patch there would then have to be dependent on this patch and include patching the files patched here).
