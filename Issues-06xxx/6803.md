We should have a symbolic Kronecker delta in Sage.

Also, current implementation of signum (sgn) function 
returns wrong answer for symbolic input.

```
sage: sgn(x)
1
sage: sgn(-x)
1
```

So we should make sgn() symbolic aware. Given, implementation of 
these functions in new symbolics should be very similar to the existing generalized function **Dirac delta** and **Heaviside**, I am putting them together here. 

Also, ticket #777 should be closed down as Sign is already in Sage
and this ticket will further enhance it.

**Patch:**

Apart from implementing these two symbolic functions, attached patch slightly speeds up three other generalized functions by avoiding default `__call__` method of PrimitiveFunction. These functions take explicit value either 0,-1,1 so those checks are not needed.

Timing **before** the patches:

```
sage: timeit('dirac_delta(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 179 µs per loop
sage: timeit('unit_step(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 345 µs per loop
sage: timeit('heaviside(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 344 µs per loop
```

Timing **after** the patches:

```
sage: timeit('dirac_delta(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 159 µs per loop
sage: timeit('heaviside(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 324 µs per loop
sage: timeit('unit_step(1.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 323 µs per loop
```

Also, it does slight re-arrangements of references.

Resolution: fixed
