Apparently 0.99.1 has a special osx makefile, which I don't think we are using.  Should we use it?

Hmm, well, it seems to be working fine on my copy of OSX.5.8.  Maybe someone else who knows something about makefiles should comment on this...

Maybe this would be a good time to improve that documentation about things like

```
sage: plot(x^3,-10,-1)
```
which almost looks like they should intersect but they don't... that's already a ticket somewhere.

Anyway, I don't have time to finish a review now, but so far everything looks fine, and as I said it built fine.

Congratulations; you found a bug in the release of matplotlib.  They errantly included a config file that should have been deleted.

I've updated the spkg, at the same URL as above.  Make sure you install it with "sage -f" to overwrite the previous one.
