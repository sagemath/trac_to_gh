Hmm, well, it seems to be working fine on my copy of OSX.5.8.  Maybe someone else who knows something about makefiles should comment on this...

Maybe this would be a good time to improve that documentation about things like

```
sage: plot(x^3,-10,-1)
```
which almost looks like they should intersect but they don't... that's already a ticket somewhere.

Anyway, I don't have time to finish a review now, but so far everything looks fine, and as I said it built fine.

Congratulations; you found a bug in the release of matplotlib.  They errantly included a config file that should have been deleted.

I've updated the spkg, at the same URL as above.  Make sure you install it with "sage -f" to overwrite the previous one.
