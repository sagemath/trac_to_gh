I'm not sure how to fix this. Should I add "# random numerical noise" in addition to "# requires optional octave"? By the way, octave is not strictly speaking an optional package is it?

The attached patch does this.

Patch applies fine to 4.0.2.rc1 and passes sage -tp 1 SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/. Also the builds sage -docbuild constructions html (resp., pdf) went fine.
