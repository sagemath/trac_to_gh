This is one of the obstructions to switching the graph backends over to Cython by default.

To quote Franco:

```
But all the doctest failures occur in the NaiveSuffixTreeClass, which
is a naive implementation. This code was only intended for testing
purposes, so I think it is fine to delete it (delete both
NaiveSuffixTree and NaiveSuffixTreeClass). I am pretty certain it is
not used anywhere else (it should not be, if it is), because it is a
very slow implementation (hence, the name naive).
