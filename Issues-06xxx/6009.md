REFEREE REPORT



The patch `trac_6009.patch` applies OK against the "post-final" sage-3.4.2, all doctests pass with the options `-t -long`. The reference manual built fine, but note that `sage/plot/text.py` is not included in the reference manual so don't be surprised when you can't search for `sage/plot/text.py` in the reference manual. The doctest coverage for `sage/plot/text.py` is 100% as claimed.



However, I notice that the patch introduces some typos and inconsistencies into the module `sage/plot/text.py`. These are fixed in the reviewer patch `trac_6009-reviewer.patch`. Apart from these issues, positive review for kcrisman's patch. Only my patch needs to be reviewed.
