Even though the input is invalid (the partition isn't a valid partition), I think segfaulting is considered a bug:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: g=graphs.CubeGraph(3)
sage: 
sage: g.relabel()
sage: g.automorphism_group(partition=[[0,1,2],[3,4,5]])
| Sage Version 3.4.1.rc2, Release Date: 2009-04-10                   |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
