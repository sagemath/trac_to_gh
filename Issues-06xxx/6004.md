<a id='comment:4'></a>Hmm, this needs a rebase:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-4.0.alpha0/devel/sage$ hg import trac_6004-odd-degree-model-5.patch 
applying trac_6004-odd-degree-model-5.patch
patching file sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 62
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
Most likely culprit is another patch by Nick:

```
changeset:   12218:684af2b9657e

Might this code already be in Sage via another patch?
