Positive review pending patch 2 having "Return an odd degree model of self, or None if one does not exist over the field of definition. " changed to something that mentions that a ValueError is raised if no model exists.

Hmm, this needs a rebase:

```
mabshoff@sage:/scratch/mabshoff/sage-4.0.alpha0/devel/sage$ hg import trac_6004-odd-degree-model-5.patch 
applying trac_6004-odd-degree-model-5.patch
patching file sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py
Hunk #1 FAILED at 62
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py.rej
abort: patch failed to apply
```
Most likely culprit is another patch by Nick:

```
changeset:   12218:684af2b9657e
user:        Nick Alexander <ncalexander@gmail.com>
date:        Thu May 07 13:37:26 2009 -0700
summary:     [mq]: trac_6004-odd-degree-model.patch
```
Might this code already be in Sage via another patch?

Cheers,

Michael
