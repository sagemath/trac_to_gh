To be extra safe, apply the patch `trac_6649_doctest.patch` to a fresh clone of the main repository, rebuild the clone and run it. Then execute the following from the Sage command line:

```
sage: @parallel()
....: def f(N): return N^2
....: 
sage: v = list(f([1,2,4])); v.sort(); v
[(((1,), {}), 1), (((2,), {}), 4), (((4,), {}), 16)]
sage: @parallel('reference')
....: def f(N): return N^2
....: 
sage: v = list(f([1,2,4])); v.sort(); v
[(((1,), {}), 1), (((2,), {}), 4), (((4,), {}), 16)]
sage: sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()
24
```
The command `sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()` would return different answers depending on the number of CPU's on your system. In the case of the machine sage.math it returns 24, which is the number of cores on that machine. For an Intel Mac with dual core, I would expect `sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()` to return 2. But in any case, testing that command on a Mac should not result in a deprecation warning. The idea of Georg's patch is to prevent the deprecation warning when using a Mac.

What I got agrees with what you said should happen:

```
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: 6649
sage: @parallel()
....: def f(N): return N^2
....: 
sage: v = list(f([1,2,4])); v.sort(); v
[(((1,), {}), 1), (((2,), {}), 4), (((4,), {}), 16)]
sage: @parallel('reference')
....: def f(N): return N^2
....: 
sage: v = list(f([1,2,4])); v.sort(); v
[(((1,), {}), 1), (((2,), {}), 4), (((4,), {}), 16)]
sage: sage.parallel.ncpus.ncpus()
2
sage: 
```
So changing this from "needs review" to "positive review".
