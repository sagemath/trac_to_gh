This is a follow up to #3687. Apparently, the issue of executable bits pop up again after they had been manually removed. That is, manually remove the executable bits of sage-banner, sage-gdb-commands, sage-maxima.lisp, and sage-verify-pyc. Then create a source distribution and you see those executable bits restored:

```
[mvngu@sage bin]$ pwd
/home/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1.alpha1/local/bin
[mvngu@sage bin]$ hg st
M sage-README-osx.txt
M sage-banner
M sage-gdb-commands
M sage-maxima.lisp
M sage-verify-pyc
```
Somewhere a script called by the command

```
sage -sdist <version-number>
```
is restoring those executable bits.

The `sage-make_devel_packages` explicitly set the x bit on all `sage-*` files.

The failure results from #7975, which removes dsage from Sage and the patches on #7975 have been merged in Sage 4.3.1.rc1. The guilty line from [scripts_6625_no_x_bit.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6625/scripts_6625_no_x_bit.patch.gz) is:
