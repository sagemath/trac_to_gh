We let ratpoints get in, and nobody thought to check that it actually builds with gcc-3.4.x.  Well, it doesn't.  This needs to get fixed.

<a id='comment:3'></a>At #7021, drkirkby updates prereq to 0.4 and writes "If gcc is used as the C compiler, the configure script checks it is at least gcc 4.0.1." Does this updated spkg invalidate this ticket? Here's a conversation on IRC:

```
23:14 < mvngu> williamstein: At #7021, I see drkirkby's note "If gcc is used as 
               the C compiler, the configure script checks it is at least gcc 
               4.0.1". This makes me wonder about the GCC 3.4.x requirement at 
               #6580.
23:14 < williamstein> good point.
23:15 < williamstein> maybe we should just move ahead and forget about 
                      supporting gcc-3.4.
23:15 < williamstein> I would be ok with that.
23:15 < williamstein> in which case 6580 could be invalidated.
23:15 < mvngu> williamstein: I don't know of any machine using GCC 3.4.x.
23:15 < williamstein> yep
23:15 < williamstein> that's why we didn't notice until after the release.
