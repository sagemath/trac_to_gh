If I run `sage -docbuild hello html`, then a directory "hello" is created in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en`.  Then if I run `sage -docbuild -help`, "hello" is listed as one of the options.

Error-checking should be done on the "document" argument of `sage -docbuild` to make sure this doesn't happen.

The patch `trac_6605-docbuild-check.patch` is buggy when it comes to (re)building the documentation of a new release. Assume you have applied this patch to Sage 4.1.1.alpha0, then build a source release with

```
sage -sdist <version>
```
or a binary release with

```
sage -bdist <version>
```
After that, upgrade a previous release to this new release and rebuild the documentation. You then get this error message:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.alpha1-test-x86_64-Linux]$ ./sage -docbuild tutorial htmlTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/scratch/mvngu/sage-4.1.1.alpha1-test-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 673, in <module>

  File "/scratch/mvngu/sage-4.1.1.alpha1-test-x86_64-Linux/devel/sage/doc/common/builder.py", line 616, in get_builder
    elif name in get_documents() or name in AllBuilder().get_all_documents():
NameError: global name 'get_documents' is not defined
```
The same error is raised if you rebuild the documentation of the binary version of the new release. I'm reopening this ticket and marking it as needs work.
