```
If I run `sage -docbuild hello html`, then a directory "hello" is created in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en`.  Then if I run `sage -docbuild -help`, "hello" is listed as one of the options.

Error-checking should be done on the "document" argument of `sage -docbuild` to make sure this doesn't happen.

The patch works for me.  I think a non-zero exit value is the UNIX convention for an error.  I can make an updated patch.  Or I can wait for more feedback on #6187.

The patch `trac_6605-docbuild-check.patch` is buggy when it comes to (re)building the documentation of a new release. Assume you have applied this patch to Sage 4.1.1.alpha0, then build a source release with

```
sage -sdist <version>
```
or a binary release with

```
sage -bdist <version>
```
After that, upgrade a previous release to this new release and rebuild the documentation. You then get this error message:

```

The same error is raised if you rebuild the documentation of the binary version of the new release. I'm reopening this ticket and marking it as needs work.
