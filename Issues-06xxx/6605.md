```
If I run `sage -docbuild hello html`, then a directory "hello" is created in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en`.  Then if I run `sage -docbuild -help`, "hello" is listed as one of the options.

Error-checking should be done on the "document" argument of `sage -docbuild` to make sure this doesn't happen.

The patch `trac_6605-docbuild-check.patch` is buggy when it comes to (re)building the documentation of a new release. Assume you have applied this patch to Sage 4.1.1.alpha0, then build a source release with

```
sage -sdist <version>
```
or a binary release with

```
sage -bdist <version>
```
After that, upgrade a previous release to this new release and rebuild the documentation. You then get this error message:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.alpha1-test-x86_64-Linux]$ ./sage -docbuild tutorial htmlTraceback (most recent call last):

    elif name in get_documents() or name in AllBuilder().get_all_documents():
NameError: global name 'get_documents' is not defined
```
The same error is raised if you rebuild the documentation of the binary version of the new release. I'm reopening this ticket and marking it as needs work.

It doesn't need work.  As I mentioned in the first comment, it depends on #6187.  That's where "get_documents" is defined.

Please wait for #6187 to merge.
