Add functionality to sage to compute the effect of a simplicial complex morphism on homology and cohomology.

This patch will rely on fuctionality in #6099, #6100, #6102, and #5882.

Hi John,

This seems pretty interesting. I just started to play around with it and was struck by a couple of minor usability issues: 

```
sage: X=simplicial_complexes.BrucknerGrunbaumSphere()
sage: phi, M = algebraic_topological_model(X, GF(2))
sage: phi
Chain homotopy between Chain complex morphism from Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 to Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 and Chain complex morphism from Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 to Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
sage: phi._codomain()
Trivial chain
sage: phi._domain()
Trivial chain
sage: phi._codomain() is phi._domain()
False
```

As you can see, I made the basic mistake of thinking of "phi._domain" as private functions, when they are in fact just attributes:

```
sage: phi._domain
Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
sage: phi._domain is phi._f._domain
True
```
The Sage maps that I'm used to (mainly morphisms between CombinatorialFreeModules) have public "domain" and "codomain" methods; this might have spared me a 5 minute detour in this case. I have no good idea, though, what to call the $H_0$ and $H_1$ of a homotopy $H_t$...  

Also, I wonder if phi shouldn't better be printed like

```
sage: phi
Chain homotopy between 
    Chain complex morphism 
      From: Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
      To:   Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
and Chain complex morphism
      From: Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
      To:   Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
```
At least this is the way morphisms between combinatorial free modules are printed:

```
sage: A,B=[CombinatorialFreeModule(GF(2),x) for x in [(1,2,3),(2,3,4)]]
sage: f=A.module_morphism(codomain=B,on_basis = lambda x:x+1) ; f
Generic morphism:
  From: Free module generated by {1, 2, 3} over Finite Field of size 2
  To:   Free module generated by {2, 3, 4} over Finite Field of size 2
```

As Christian implied, you should use `.domain()` and `.codomain()` in the docstring and try to make thing behave like other morphisms as much as possible (anything inheriting from `Morphism` has some method like `_repr_defn` or similar).

For the record, this is on my todo list, but I don't know when I might be able to do a full review.

Good suggestions, Christian. I've made some changes to try to address them.

Regarding $H_0$ and $H_1$ (currently `._f` and `._g`), I don't know good names either, but I also almost never needed to use those attributes (only when constructing the dual chain homotopy).

I'm a bit confused by these dependencies - what's the right place to start reviewing things: 6101, 6102, or 19179 ?

I suppose I should change the `_repr_` method for induced homology maps here, but not right now.

I wonder if we might use bracket-notation, so that a homotopy `H` goes from `H[0]` to `H[1]`? But I don't know if there are precedents in Sage for custom `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` methods. And I'm also not sure, whether there's a real need for this...

It gives us a little bit of extra features (like `register_as_coercion()`) and more consistent class hierarchy, but it isn't a requirement. It might also make things easier once homsets become proper parents too, but that is so far down the road that it's not worth it the worry either.

If I try to merge #18175, the test suite fails more tests than before:

```
The following tests failed: _test_an_element, _test_elements, _test_elements_eq_reflexive, _test_elements_eq_symmetric, _test_elements_eq_transitive, _test_elements_neq, _test_some_elements
```
because

```
NotImplementedError: please implement _an_element_ for Simplicial complex ...
```
I'm not sure what `_an_element_` should return: a simplex (since a simplicial complex is a set of simplices)? a vertex (since their images determine maps)? a facet (since they determine the complex)?

As far as morphisms go, it was not hard to switch to them (assuming I did everything right).
