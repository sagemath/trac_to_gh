<a id='comment:10'></a>Hi John,

This seems pretty interesting. I just started to play around with it and was struck by a couple of minor usability issues: 

```
sage: X=simplicial_complexes.BrucknerGrunbaumSphere()
sage: phi, M = algebraic_topological_model(X, GF(2))
sage: phi
Chain homotopy between Chain complex morphism from Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 to Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 and Chain complex morphism from Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2 to Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
sage: phi._codomain()
Trivial chain
sage: phi._domain()
Trivial chain
sage: phi._codomain() is phi._domain()
False
```

As you can see, I made the basic mistake of thinking of "phi._domain" as private functions, when they are in fact just attributes:

```
sage: phi._domain
Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
sage: phi._domain is phi._f._domain
True
```
The Sage maps that I'm used to (mainly morphisms between CombinatorialFreeModules) have public "domain" and "codomain" methods; this might have spared me a 5 minute detour in this case. I have no good idea, though, what to call the $H_0$ and $H_1$ of a homotopy $H_t$...  

Also, I wonder if phi shouldn't better be printed like

```
sage: phi
Chain homotopy between 
    Chain complex morphism 
      From: Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
      To:   Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
and Chain complex morphism
      From: Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
      To:   Chain complex with at most 4 nonzero terms over Finite Field of size 2
```
At least this is the way morphisms between combinatorial free modules are printed:

```
sage: A,B=[CombinatorialFreeModule(GF(2),x) for x in [(1,2,3),(2,3,4)]]
sage: f=A.module_morphism(codomain=B,on_basis = lambda x:x+1) ; f
Generic morphism:
  From: Free module generated by {1, 2, 3} over Finite Field of size 2
  To:   Free module generated by {2, 3, 4} over Finite Field of size 2
```

I wonder if we might use bracket-notation, so that a homotopy `H` goes from `H[0]` to `H[1]`? But I don't know if there are precedents in Sage for custom `__getitem__`, `__setitem__` methods. And I'm also not sure, whether there's a real need for this...
