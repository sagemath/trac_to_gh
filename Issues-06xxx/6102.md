```
Add functionality in sage to compute the cohomology ring of a simplicial complex.

This relies on #6099, #6100, and #5882.

These will be examples of graded alebras, finite as modules over their bases, that are graded-commutative.

Depends on #19179

The following code was posted by Felix Breuer on [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/mdEKXfBTHOY/discussion)

```
def cup_product(X,c1,dim1,c2,dim2):
    d = dim1 + dim2 
    faces1 = list(X.n_faces(dim1))
    faces2 = list(X.n_faces(dim2))
    faces = list(X.n_faces(d))
    res = []
    for sigma in faces:
        sigma1 = Simplex(sigma[0:dim1+1])
        sigma2 = Simplex(sigma[dim1:d+1])
        index1 = faces1.index(sigma1)
        index2 = faces2.index(sigma2)
        coeff1 = c1[index1]
        coeff2 = c2[index2]
        coeff = coeff1 * coeff2
        res.append(coeff)
    return vector(tuple(res))
```
To use it on the Torus, for example, you can do this:

```
X = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
C = X.chain_complex(cochain=True)
H = C.homology(generators=True)
gen1 = H[1][1][0]
gen2 = H[1][1][1]
d1 = C.differential()[1]
q = cup_product(X,gen1,1,gen1,1)
print q
print d1.solve_right(q)
p = cup_product(X,gen1,1,gen2,1)
print p
print d1.solve_right(p) #error
```

An update: I have a new version of `algebraic_topological_model.py`, which is the key to everything here. I'm calling it `AT_model.py`, and I'll attach it to the ticket. The good news:

- it works for Delta complexes
- it's faster with mod 2 coefficients:

```
sage: from sage.homology.algebraic_topological_model import algebraic_topological_model
sage: from sage.homology.AT_model import AT_model
sage: RP3 = simplicial_complexes.RealProjectiveSpace(3)
sage: %time phi, H = algebraic_topological_model(RP3, GF(2)) # old version
CPU times: user 813 ms, sys: 150 ms, total: 963 ms
Wall time: 852 ms
sage: %time phi, H = AT_model(RP3, GF(2))     # new version
CPU times: user 345 ms, sys: 32.3 ms, total: 377 ms
Wall time: 354 ms
```
The bad news: it's *much* slower with rational coefficients, and I have no idea why:

```
sage: %time phi, H = algebraic_topological_model(RP3, QQ)   # old version
CPU times: user 1.27 s, sys: 138 ms, total: 1.41 s
Wall time: 1.35 s
sage: %time phi, H = AT_model(RP3, QQ)      # new version
CPU times: user 23.9 s, sys: 69.6 ms, total: 24 s
Wall time: 24 s
```
Profiling the code with `%prun` was not illuminating to me, and I couldn't run `%crun` because I couldn't get [the Google performance analysis tools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) to install on my machine. Optimizing code is not my strong suit, in any case.

Because of this, I haven't tried to implement cup products for Delta complexes. I think I know how to do that, but it hasn't felt worth it yet.

I think the issue comes from the fact that a category pushout is being done. This doesn't seem to happen in the finite fields of prime order cases, but it does show up for prime powers. However, for `GF(4, 'a')`, it took a non-trivial amount of time (over 2 seconds on my machine).

From doing a line by line profiling, here's the lines that take the longest over `QQ`:

```
Line #      Hits         Time  Per Hit   % Time  Line Contents
==============================================================
   210       182       745504   4096.2      5.8              c_bar = c - phi_old * diff * c
   211       182       452404   2485.7      3.5              pi_bdry_c_bar = pi_old * diff * c_bar 
   236      5321     10852810   2039.6     84.1                      eta_ij = (pi_old * c_j)[u_idx]
   244        90       323096   3590.0      2.5                  phi_old = MS_phi_t.matrix(phi_old_cols).transpose()
   290         1        27459  27459.0      0.2      phi = ChainContraction(phi_data, pi, iota)
```
where the time is given in microseconds. Over `GF(2)`, these operations are significantly faster per call.

Is there anything else you'd like to do to this before I set it to positive review?

sage: RP3 = simplicial_complexes.RealProjectiveSpace(3)
sage: %timeit algebraic_topological_model(RP3, GF(2))

The fixes for #19377 and #19378 won't make much of a difference, because I think the main bottlenecks are matrix-matrix multiplication and matrix-vector multiplication. For #19378, it's easy enough to bypass the whole issue by testing whether the appropriate matrix is `nx0`. #18231 could help, since at least with the Delta-complex version, some of the slowest parts are constructing matrices.

I don't know where to look in the linear algebra code to improve the timings. I ran tests of the form

```
%timeit random_matrix(QQ, 40, density=0.1, sparse=True) * random_vector(QQ, 40, density=0.1, sparse=False)
```
and similarly with the second factor being a vector, and then I varied which factors were sparse. I tried with different coefficient fields, also. Over the rationals, as the density decreases, the timing for dense matrices stays pretty constant, but it speeds up for sparse matrices. (This is without even taking into account the fact that it is slower to construct random sparse matrices: see #2705.) Over finite fields, it's constant both ways, and slower for sparse matrices.

I think that cup products for Delta complexes can come on a separate ticket, if anyone ever figures it out. I'll see what I can do, but I don't want it to hold up this ticket.

I made some reviewer changes, and it's mostly tweaking docstrings and copying your sparse/dense hack to get another ~20% in the "new" version.

Ffrom taking a closer look at things, I bet we could get further speedups by not taking the transpose of the `phi_old` and `pi_old` matrices in the inner loops and using `v * M` multiplication instead of `M' * v`. I tried to do this, but I don't think I understand the interworkings of the code to get this to work (at least for the "new" version). Have you tried to do this?

Also I noticed that `HomologyVectorSpaceWithBasis` represents a graded piece of the (co)homology space. Would you be opposed to me rewriting that such that it becomes the full (co)homology space/ring? I think it would simplify the overall code structure, allow easier extensions to infinite simplicial/cell complexes, and give a better interpretation of `cup_product` as being the product in the cohomology ring. (Also with #18175, we could then give work towards a cap product for manifolds.)

If you would prefer one/both of these things to be pushed to later tickets, we can do that, but I'd rather get the latter done now.

Good idea. I just tried it and it led to no improvement, surprisingly, over the rationals, and a slow-down in characteristic 2. Maybe the lack of improvement is not that surprising, since I had already moved the slow matrix constructions out of the inner-most loops, so they don't get executed as much.

I think that it is natural to want both structures, the cohomology in a single degree and the cohomology in total. If you want to rewrite this part, that's okay with me. If you want to think about the most natural way to access cohomology classes, too, go ahead. I am not completely satisfied with

```
sage: a,b,c,d = X.cohomology_with_basis(1, QQ).gens()
```
Maybe

```
sage: H.<x> = X.cohomology_with_basis(1, QQ)
```
will define `x0`, ..., `x3` if the cohomology is 4-dimensional? Or x10, ..., x13? (The problem with the angle-bracket notation is that we shouldn't have to know how many generators there are ahead of time.)

> I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't a significant speedup and I apologize if I did. However that is a much larger difference than I really expected. Eeek!

No need to apologize, you had a reasonable question. And it is surprising how much difference that single change makes.

So the way to optimize this further is to speed up the matrix construction, which might depend upon the input data, and then also the dot product is the 3rd slowest line.

> > From taking a closer look at things, I bet we could get further speedups by not taking the transpose of the `phi_old` and `pi_old` matrices in the inner loops and using `v * M` multiplication instead of `M' * v`. I tried to do this, but I don't think I understand the interworkings of the code to get this to work (at least for the "new" version). Have you tried to do this?

> Good idea. I just tried it and it led to no improvement, surprisingly, over the rationals, and a slow-down in characteristic 2. Maybe the lack of improvement is not that surprising, since I had already moved the slow matrix constructions out of the inner-most loops, so they don't get executed as much. And maybe taking the transpose is not slow compared to the rest of matrix construction.

Yea, I confirm that there is not much time being spent on the transpose by just pulling that part out to a separate line (which I should have done beforehand, sorry). So the way to optimize this further is to speed up the matrix construction, which might depend upon the input data, and then also the dot product is the 3rd slowest line. I think we've gotten to a good point that we should just let it be for now (at least I'm not going to try and optimize it further because I will be doing the refactoring below).

> > Also I noticed that `HomologyVectorSpaceWithBasis` represents a graded piece of the (co)homology space. Would you be opposed to me rewriting that such that it becomes the full (co)homology space/ring? I think it would simplify the overall code structure, allow easier extensions to infinite simplicial/cell complexes, and give a better interpretation of `cup_product` as being the product in the cohomology ring. (Also with #18175, we could then give work towards a cap product for manifolds.)

>

There is a way to access the part in a single degree with the `basis` function by passing in an integer:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: list(s.basis(3))
[s[3], s[2, 1], s[1, 1, 1]]
```
This unfortunately doesn't work for most of the infinite dimensional CFM's, but there should be a generic method that works for all objects in `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis`. At which point, we can use the `submodule` to construct the degree part (which also should have a dedicated method):

```
sage: s.submodule(list(s.basis(3)), already_echelonized=True)
Free module generated by {0, 1, 2} over Rational Field
```

What we could do is specify variable names and then could use the `inject_variables` method. I will think more about this tomorrow when I work on the above refactoring.
