Unfortunately it doesn't. 

GiNaC doesn't define the function `cot`. Sage defines it in the file
`sage/functions/trig.py` starting at line 184. I suppose it was written quickly by Mike during the symbolics switch.

Defining a custom derivative function (named `_derivative_`) in that
class should fix this.

Thanks for the quick patch.

Here is my review:
* the keyword argument `diff_param` is only useful for multivariate functions. In this case since all these functions are univariate, so we know the argument is `args[0]`. You can safely drop the first two lines of the `_derivative_()` methods and replace the third with `x = args[0]`.
* continuing the previous item, we should tell these functions they are univariate. ATM, they silently drop the second argument:

```
sage: arccsc(a,b)
arccsc(a)
```
 You can do this by giving `nargs=1` as a parameter to the base class constructor.
* It is better to give the variable as an argument to `diff` in the doctests, for example `diff(asech(x), x)`. I actually prefer `asech(x).derivative(x)`, but this is your patch. :)
* The formula for the derivative of `asech(x)` you use is only true for x real. You need `-1/(x * (x+1) * sqrt( (1-x)/(1+x) ))`.
* Similarly, the derivative of `acsch(x)` is `-1/(x^2 * sqrt(1 + 1/x^2) )`

Can someone else check the derivatives to make sure there is no mistake?

Functions that inherit from `PrimitiveFunction` are automatically given `nargs = 1` on L800 of `symbolic/function.pyx`. So the silent dropping of arguments is more of a usability problem on the Symbolic side.

I've made the changes for the derivatives of `asech(x)` and `acsch(x)`. I've also generalized the derivatives for `asec(x)` and `acsc(x)`.

Anyone who wants to review the derivatives can check: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Derivative.html, http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseHyperbolicFunctions.html and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseTrigonometricFunctions.html
