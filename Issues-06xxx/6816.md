Integration sometimes hangs in sage-4.1.1.

```
flat:~ wstein$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1.1, Release Date: 2009-08-14                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: var('t,theta')
(t, theta)
sage: integrate(t * cos(-theta*t), (t,-oo,oo))
[.. and it hangs forever ..]
```

In fact, in Maxima what is happening is the following:

```
(%i6) integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),t,-inf,inf);
Is  theta  positive, negative, or zero?

positive       <--- i type this.

;
(%o6)                                  0
(%i7) 
```

For some reason the question "Is  theta  positive, negative, or zero?" is not getting seen by pexpect as it should.  Argh!

This works in Maxima:

```
(%i1) assume(theta>0);
(%o1)                             [theta > 0]
(%i2) integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),t,-inf,inf);
(%o2)                                  0
```

The same doesn't work in Sage though, which is very weird:

```
sage: var('t,theta')
(t, theta)
sage: assume(theta>0)
sage: integrate(t * cos(-theta*t), (t,-oo,oo))
```

Just an update; in Maxima 5.19.1 (in Sage, in fact from maxima_console() ) this particular example does not even ask a question but returns zero.

But it still hangs in Sage.  That is really strange.  Note that the indefinite integral works fine in Sage.

Hmm...that code looks pretty long.  Why not just:

```
if 1<=len(v)<=3:
    return integral(expression,*v)
```

and take care of all three cases in one swoop?

Also, it completely ignores the rest of the parameters in the function call, like algorithm, etc.

Just an update - it turns out the original integral reported here is not, in fact, convergent - it is an odd function, so the limit of the indefinite integral evaluated at N and -N is 0, though.  Fixing this doctest so something mathematically correct happens will be done in #7745, since Maxima 5.20.1 simply returns that integral now, as opposed to giving 0.
