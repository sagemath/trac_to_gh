Integration sometimes hangs in sage-4.1.1.

```
flat:~ wstein$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1.1, Release Date: 2009-08-14                       |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: var('t,theta')
(t, theta)
sage: integrate(t * cos(-theta*t), (t,-oo,oo))
[.. and it hangs forever ..]
```

In fact, in Maxima what is happening is the following:

```
(%i6) integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),t,-inf,inf);
Is  theta  positive, negative, or zero?

positive       <--- i type this.

;
(%o6)                                  0
(%i7) 
```

For some reason the question "Is  theta  positive, negative, or zero?" is not getting seen by pexpect as it should.  Argh!

This works in Maxima:

```
(%i1) assume(theta>0);
(%o1)                             [theta > 0]
(%i2) integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),t,-inf,inf);
(%o2)                                  0
```

The same doesn't work in Sage though, which is very weird:

```
sage: var('t,theta')
(t, theta)
sage: assume(theta>0)
sage: integrate(t * cos(-theta*t), (t,-oo,oo))
```

Just an update; in Maxima 5.19.1 (in Sage, in fact from maxima_console() ) this particular example does not even ask a question but returns zero.

But it still hangs in Sage.  That is really strange.  Note that the indefinite integral works fine in Sage.

This ticket is invalid.  

```
sage: var('t,theta')
(t, theta)
sage: integrate(t*cos(-theta*t),t,-oo,oo)

```

In fact, ANY sage integration attempted with the syntax provided by the originator of the ticket will fail!!!  That's because (for better or for worse) we don't have #1221 or #2787 in Sage.  But those tickets already exist.

Hmm...that code looks pretty long.  Why not just:

```
if 1<=len(v)<=3:
    return integral(expression,*v)
```

and take care of all three cases in one swoop?

Also, it completely ignores the rest of the parameters in the function call, like algorithm, etc.

Just an update - it turns out the original integral reported here is not, in fact, convergent - it is an odd function, so the limit of the indefinite integral evaluated at N and -N is 0, though.
