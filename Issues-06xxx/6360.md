Currently, singular seems to segfault on some architecture/OS combinations, such as SuSE and ia64. (See #6240 for more details.) The spkg available at `/scratch/craigcitro/patches/singular-3-1-0-2-20090618.spkg` on `sage.math` changes `-O2` to `-O0` to fix this problem until we can get to the root of it (i.e. until we fix #6240).
