Here's a patch.  Is it accurate (especially the part about having jsMath installed locally)?

I apologize for not posting a note here earlier, but the latest changeset at #6187 "documents" the `--jsmath` flag and several new command-line options for `sage -docbuild`.  Of course, that approach may not be right, but if it's OK, should we modify it, instead?
