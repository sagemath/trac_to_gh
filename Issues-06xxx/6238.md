The first face does not have vertices in clockwise order.  At least, not for me :)  Hard to see without show-ing the graph.

The problem is that you are never asking the graph to remember the embedding, so when you show the graph, you are just looking at some random embedding.

The way to do what you're trying to do is to ask the graph to remember the planar positioning:

```
sage: G.is_planar(set_embedding=True, set_pos=True)
```

i.e. change a 'False' to a 'True'. :)
