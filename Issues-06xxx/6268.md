Typesettings of sec(x), csc(x), cot(x) are broken. It puts an
extra "\mbox" around them. However, typesetting for sin(x), 
cos(x), tan(x) works as expected.

Is this a bug in ginac/pynac?  Look at this:

```
sage: SR
Symbolic Ring
sage: SR._latex_element_(sin(x))
'\\sin\\left(x\\right)'
sage: SR._latex_element_(sec(x))
'\\mbox{\\sec}\\left(x\\right)'
```
The method `_latex_element_` is a one-liner:

```
        return GEx_to_str_latex(&x._gobj)
```
and I think GEx_to_str_latex is a ginac/pynac thing.  At least, I found it in sage/libs/ginac/decl.pxi.

It's possible to work around it, I think, with a patch like the attached, but I'm not at all convinced that this is the right way to fix it.  If you think it's okay, feel free to review it, but since I'm not sure, I've labeled it as "not read for review".
