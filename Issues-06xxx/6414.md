Currently, every now and then a user reports on sage-support, that he got an error message like

```
/Applications/sage-4.0.1-OSX10.5-PowerPC-PowerMacintosh-Darwin/sage/
local/bin/sage-sage: line 198:   407 Illegal instruction     sage-
ipython "$@" -i
```
This is e.g. the case if a Sage binary built on a MacPPC with a G5 processor (typically the one the OS X 10.5 bdist is created on) is used on a MacPPC with only a G4 processor.

For the *nix world on Intel/AMD processors, the sage-flags.txt file was created for just the purpose to check whether the CPU is sufficient, to let a certain Sage binary run.

We seem to need something in that direction for OS X, too (though momentarily only for the PPC processors, not the Intel ones).

Is this still an issue with the new checks for moving OSX etc?

? That doesn't really work on OS X all the time, we have seen many error messages on ask.sagemath for this for different instruction sets.

I haven't heard of any such bug recently. In any case, such things should be fixed on a case-by-case basis, I don't think that there is a general fix possible. So I still think that this ticket should be closed.

certainly with 6.9 binaries it is the case (e.g. reported  [today on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/C1eENI3yrtw/b5ChRoJkAQAJ)). There were also very entertaining bugs like this reported by someone with a Mac box having a non-standard (upgraded?) CPU... 
Don't recall about 7.1/2 right now. 

By the way: [faq-usage](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#i-downloaded-a-sage-binary-and-it-crashes-on-startup-with-illegal-instruction-what-can-i-do) says: **Nobody has yet figured out how to build Sage in such a way that MPIR and ATLAS work on all hardware.**
