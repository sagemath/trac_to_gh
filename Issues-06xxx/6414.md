Currently, every now and then a user reports on sage-support, that he got an error message like

```
/Applications/sage-4.0.1-OSX10.5-PowerPC-PowerMacintosh-Darwin/sage/
local/bin/sage-sage: line 198:   407 Illegal instruction     sage-
ipython "$@" -i
```
This is e.g. the case if a Sage binary built on a MacPPC with a G5 processor (typically the one the OS X 10.5 bdist is created on) is used on a MacPPC with only a G4 processor.

For the *nix world on Intel/AMD processors, the sage-flags.txt file was created for just the purpose to check whether the CPU is sufficient, to let a certain Sage binary run.

We seem to need something in that direction for OS X, too (though momentarily only for the PPC processors, not the Intel ones).

I haven't heard of any such bug recently. In any case, such things should be fixed on a case-by-case basis, I don't think that there is a general fix possible. So I still think that this ticket should be closed.

certainly with 6.9 binaries it is the case (e.g. reported  [today on sage-support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/C1eENI3yrtw/b5ChRoJkAQAJ)). There were also very entertaining bugs like this reported by someone with a Mac box having a non-standard (upgraded?) CPU... 
Don't recall about 7.1/2 right now. 

By the way: [faq-usage](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#i-downloaded-a-sage-binary-and-it-crashes-on-startup-with-illegal-instruction-what-can-i-do) says: **Nobody has yet figured out how to build Sage in such a way that MPIR and ATLAS work on all hardware.**
