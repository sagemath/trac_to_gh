The following section of the patch `trac_6751.patch` from #6751 results in two warnings when building the reference manual:

```
1202	            - QuadraticForm 
1203	 
1204	        This function computes the positive definition quadratic form 
1205	        obtained by letting G be the trace zero subspace of ZZ + 
1206	        2*self, which had rank 3, and restricting the pairing 
1207	           (x,y) = (x.conjugate()*y).reduced_trace() 
1208	        to G. 
```
The warning messages are:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra.py:docstring of sage.algebras.quatalg.quaternion_algebra:7: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation.
