Patch works and cleans directory up. Just one thing: in my installation there is a hidden `.example.sage.py` file left in latex_embed. Is it just here in my installation? If yes, positive review, otherwise we have to investigate where it is coming from ;)

Yes, same for me, otherwise i would have updated the patch myself ;)

I confirmed this with the hg.sagemath.org tracker, too. .* files seem to be ignored by hg anyways.

Good, apart from that positive review. So, whoever merges this: **you have to delete a hidden file by hand**!!!
