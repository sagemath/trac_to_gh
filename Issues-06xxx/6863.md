This is related to, but not dependent on, #6829.

Cusps over a number field K are elements of `P^1(K)`.  Support for these is to be provided as part of the general implementation of modular symbols and related matters over number fields.

A patch which will be available shortly will supply this implementation, together with related utilities such as testing Gamma_0(N)-equivalence etc.

This work has been done by Maite Aranes, under the supervision of John Cremona.

So this code looks **really** nice -- I'm really happy to see this functionality in Sage, and I'm very impressed with the completeness of the functionality, and the documentation/doctests.

However, I think this code does need some purely cosmetic changes before we merge it. Here are my first thoughts:

* I think that we shouldn't provide a separate "NFCusp" function to the user -- they should just call Cusp, which could deduce the base ring from the arguments, and take an optional `base_ring=` parameter.

* For that matter, we should probably just have a `Cusp_rationals` and `Cusp_number_field` class which both inherit from a `Cusp_generic`, and unify as much of this code as possible with the existing cusps code. 

* Similar comments to the previous two also apply to `NFCusps`, i.e. the parent for cusps. 

* I really like that there are convenient functions for getting a corresponding number field element from a cusp -- however, we should probably do the extra work to make the coercion framework know about these, so that you could simply do something like `K(c)` to get a representative for the cusp. 

* In fact, I might go one step further and say that we shouldn't really need to add any new functions into the global namespace -- i.e. `sage/modular/all.py` shouldn't need to import anything directly, except maybe the `_clear_cache` functions. All of the things that do get imported are analogues for number fields of existing bits, which should be able to be handled transparently.

I think that's it at a first go, but it's probably enough to get started moving in the right direction. John and/or Maite, do you want to make these changes, or would you rather I do it? I won't get to it for about two weeks, but I'm happy to do it if you won't have time before then.
