Although the build of pari goes ok on Solaris, there is an error when building the modified sage library code. It complains about syntax errors - see below.

I have developed a patch, and will apply it later, including this tick number.

Having looked at this more, and the pari package in particular, it was clear similar (but more severe) issues had arisen on OS X with the inclusion of this pari header file. The solution adopted for OS X was to create a specific header file for OS X, and copy that over. 

The following package does exactly the same thing, but only for Solaris. The changes needed appeared different from those needed for OS X, so I could not use the OS version of the header file for Solaris too. In the case of OS X, libraries had to be manually copied around too - no such changes were needed on Solaris, just a simple copy of a file. The extra code added to spkg-install was:

```

    if [ `uname` = "SunOS" ]; then
       set -e
       echo "Patching include/pari/paripriv.h so it works on Solaris"
       echo "The changes are much smaller than needed on OS X"
       cp  "$TOP"/patches/paripriv-Solaris.h $SAGE_LOCAL/include/pari/paripriv.h       
       set +e
    fi

```

The files can be found at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/pari-2.3.3.p5/

This is the last remaining issue that prevent Sage building on Solaris with no manual intervention. It requires that gcc is used, and that SAGE64 is **not** set to 'yes', as this code will only build in 32-bit mode.
