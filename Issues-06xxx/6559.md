```
In new symbolics, the default symbolic variables are complex.
However, sometime it is useful/desirable to make the domain of
variables to be real.


Currently, there are no way to specify the domain of variables
in Sage although underlying Ginac allows it.  For example: following
would to be good to have.

```
sage: var('x,y,z', domain='real')
```




Instructions for installing these patches (sage-4.1.1)

**(1) Pynac patch**   
 (a) Get the pynac spkg

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.8.p2.spkg

 (b) Apply the pynac patch for enhanced symbols

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/texname-and-domain-of-symbols-pynac.patch

 (c) install the patched spkg in Sage.

 **OR** if you are feeling lazy, you can directly install my patched copy of pynac from here

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/pynac-0.1.8.p2-symbols.spkg


**(2) Sage patch:**

Apply the attached sage patch after modified pynac spkg is installed

**Notes:**

#6403 will also be resolved by this patch

#6340 patch conflicts with this patch. This patch here should supersede the patch at #6340.

Attachment: **[trac_6559-referee.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6559/trac_6559-referee.patch.gz)**

I uploaded a revised version of Golam's patch at [attachment: trac_6559-domain-and-latex_name-for-variable.take2.3.patch,.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6559/678c7bbb14cedf8ebc36d8fa3152db0b.gz) and a referee patch at [attachment: trac_6559-referee.patch..gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6559/trac_6559-referee.patch..gz)

The changes in the revised patch over Golam's version are
* rebased to 4.3.rc0
* removed `sage.symbolic.ring.SR.new_var()` and `sage.symbolic.ring.is_ComplexVariable()` functions. The first is same as `SR.symbol()` and I don't see a use for the second, since all variables are complex. :)
* removed pickling changes in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression, since unpickling in this case could create a new variable with the same name as an existing one, but with a different domain. This would lead to rather confusing situations.

The referee patch reorganizes the new code a little to make it more efficient. Apparently the new variable creation is an important operation and being sloppy here greatly increases doctest timings. It also adds new methods like `_is_positive()`, `_is_real()` to the expression class to allow querying for more properties.

Only the patches 
* [attachment: trac_6559-domain-and-latex_name-for-variable.take2.3.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6559/trac_6559-domain-and-latex_name-for-variable.take2.3.patch.gz) and
* [attachment: trac_6559-referee.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6559/trac_6559-referee.patch.gz) 
should be applied.

This ticket depends on the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.11.spkg

which in turns depends on the patches at #7822, #7876, #7363, #7955, #7957, #7916 and #6465 (in that order).

The changes here seem to slow down the maxima interface dramatically, so I'm leaving this as needs work for now.

Update: None of the previous errors happen in this symbolics queue until I hit this ticket, so they are definitely due to this one.

More comments:  

1. The original patch only causes the sage/functions/generalized.py doctest errors, not the other two.  It did not appear with all patches up through ticket #6465.

2. The original patch does NOT cause massive slowdown or segfaults in doctesting sage/calculus/calculus.py.

So perhaps the referee patch has changed something weird?

> Is it possible that the problems you report might be caused by the fact that your tree got messed up by the git style patches attached to #6465?

Possibly, but wouldn't that have made everything not work, as opposed to just a few weird segfaults related to assumptions and a couple other things? 

Also, when I say I applied them all at once, what I mean is I applied them one after the other using hg_sage.import_patch, which I believe is equivalent to hg import.

I tried once more with the patches downloaded from trac. I cannot reproduce any problems.

Here is an easier way to test all the patches:

* Make a fresh clone, called "pynac"
* go to the source tree for the clone

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-pynac
```
* download this tar file

```
wget http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac_patches.tar.bz2
```
* extract it to the queue repository

```
cd .hg
tar jxvf ../pynac_patches.tar.bz2
cd ..
```
* apply all the patches

```
hg qpush -a
```

* if the new pynac package is not already installed download and install it

```
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.11.spkg
```

* rebuild Sage

```
./sage -br
```

* run tests

```
./sage -tp 3 devel/sage-pynac/sage/{symbolic,calculus,functions}
```

See [#6465 comment:19](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6465#comment:19). Two patches on that ticket needed to be rebased to 4.3.2. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to update the patch tarball.

You can use `hg qdelete <patch_name>` to remove the offending patches from the queue, and `hg qimport` new ones. The specific list of command to be executed is:

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-pynac
hg qpop -a
hg qdelete trac_6465-moves-integration-into-sfunction-subclass.take2.patch
hg qdelete trac_6465-integral.take3.patch
hg qgoto trac_6465-chain_rule.take2.patch
hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6465/trac_6465-integral.take4.patch.gz
hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6465/trac_6465-moves-integration-into-sfunction-subclass.take3.patch.gz
hg qpush -a
```

Then rebuild sage, and proceed with the tests...

Many thanks for looking at this.

Hi Ross,

The last output you posted doesn't make sense to me. Did you update to 4.3.3.alpha0 since [comment:18](#comment%3A18)? In [comment:18](#comment%3A18), the output shows that `trac_7955-integrate_latex.patch` applies cleanly. I don't see any other reason why it would fail now.

I don't have a working copy of 4.3.3.alpha0 yet. Unfortunately, it will take me a couple of days update to that.

```
hg qdelete trac_7955-integrate_latex.patch

the rest of the patches should apply without problems.
