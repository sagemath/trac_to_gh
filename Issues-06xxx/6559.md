```
In new symbolics, the default symbolic variables are complex.
However, sometime it is useful/desirable to make the domain of
variables to be real.


Currently, there are no way to specify the domain of variables
in Sage although underlying Ginac allows it.  For example: following
would to be good to have.

```
sage: var('x,y,z', domain='real')
```




Instructions for installing these patches (sage-4.1.1)

**(1) Pynac patch**   
 (a) Get the pynac spkg

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.8.p2.spkg

 (b) Apply the pynac patch for enhanced symbols

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/texname-and-domain-of-symbols-pynac.patch

 (c) install the patched spkg in Sage.

 **OR** if you are feeling lazy, you can directly install my patched copy of pynac from here

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/pynac-0.1.8.p2-symbols.spkg


**(2) Sage patch:**

Apply the attached sage patch after modified pynac spkg is installed

**Notes:**

#6403 will also be resolved by this patch

#6340 patch conflicts with this patch. This patch here should supersede the patch at #6340.

I uploaded a revised version of Golam's patch at attachment:trac_6559-domain-and-latex_name-for-variable.take2.3.patch, and a referee patch at attachment:trac_6559-referee.patch.

The changes in the revised patch over Golam's version are
* rebased to 4.3.rc0
* removed `sage.symbolic.ring.SR.new_var()` and `sage.symbolic.ring.is_ComplexVariable()` functions. The first is same as `SR.symbol()` and I don't see a use for the second, since all variables are complex. :)
* removed pickling changes in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression, since unpickling in this case could create a new variable with the same name as an existing one, but with a different domain. This would lead to rather confusing situations.

The referee patch reorganizes the new code a little to make it more efficient. Apparently the new variable creation is an important operation and being sloppy here greatly increases doctest timings. It also adds new methods like `_is_positive()`, `_is_real()` to the expression class to allow querying for more properties.

Only the patches 
* attachment:trac_6559-domain-and-latex_name-for-variable.take2.3.patch and
* attachment:trac_6559-referee.patch 
should be applied.

This ticket depends on the new pynac package here:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.11.spkg

which in turns depends on the patches at #7822, #7876, #7363, #7955, #7957, #7916 and #6465 (in that order).

The changes here seem to slow down the maxima interface dramatically, so I'm leaving this as needs work for now.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Update: None of the previous errors happen in this symbolics queue until I hit this ticket, so they are definitely due to this one.

More comments:  

1. The original patch only causes the sage/functions/generalized.py doctest errors, not the other two.  It did not appear with all patches up through ticket #6465.

2. The original patch does NOT cause massive slowdown or segfaults in doctesting sage/calculus/calculus.py.

So perhaps the referee patch has changed something weird?

Possibly, but wouldn't that have made everything not work, as opposed to just a few weird segfaults related to assumptions and a couple other things? 

Also, when I say I applied them all at once, what I mean is I applied them one after the other using hg_sage.import_patch, which I believe is equivalent to hg import.

You can use `hg qdelete <patch_name>` to remove the offending patches from the queue, and `hg qimport` new ones. The specific list of command to be executed is:

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-pynac

hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6465/trac_6465-moves-integration-into-sfunction-subclass.take3.patch
hg qpush -a

Then rebuild sage, and proceed with the tests...

<a id='comment:21'></a>Hi Ross,

The last output you posted doesn't make sense to me. Did you update to 4.3.3.alpha0 since[comment:18](#comment%3A18)? In[comment:18](#comment%3A18), the output shows that `trac_7955-integrate_latex.patch` applies cleanly. I don't see any other reason why it would fail now.

I don't have a working copy of 4.3.3.alpha0 yet. Unfortunately, it will take me a couple of days update to that.
