Since gcd(3/2, 9/5) used to be 3/10, it was used in lattice_polytope functions for rescaling to primitive integral vectors in the given rational direction. This is no longer true and leads to bugs:

```
sage: p = ReflexivePolytope(2, 1)
sage: lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: matrix has denominators so can't change to ZZ.
```
The patch adds a function integral_length and uses it instead of gcd:

```
sage: p = ReflexivePolytope(2, 1)
sage: lattice_polytope.positive_integer_relations(p.vertices())
[2 1 1]
```
