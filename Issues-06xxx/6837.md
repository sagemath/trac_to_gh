In Koblitz's book "Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms", Proposition III.3.17, it is proved that if f(q)=sum<sub>n=0</sub><sup>infinity</sup> a_n q<sup>n</sup> is the Fourier expansion of a modular form in M<sub>k</sub>(Gamma<sub>0</sub>(M),chi) and chi_1 is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo N, then f_chi(q)=sum<sub>n=0</sub><sup>infinity</sup> \chi_1(n) a_n q<sup>n</sup> is a modular form in M_k(\Gamma_0(MN<sup>2</sup>),\chi\chi_1<sup>2</sup>). This is a proposed method for objects of type 'sage.modular.modform.element.ModularFormElement' which will create f_\chi given f and chi.

```
def twist(f,chi):
        r"""
        This function returns the twist of the modular form f by the Dirichlet character chi

        INPUT:

        - ``f`` - a modular form

        - ``chi`` - a Dirichlet character

        OUTPUT:

        f_\chi, the twist of f by chi; if f(q)=sum_{n=0}^infty a_n q^n, then f_chi(q)=sum_{n=0}^infty chi(n) a_n q^n ([Koblitz]).

        EXAMPLES:

        Here is a basic example:

        ::

                sage: f=CuspForms(11,2).0
                sage: f.q_expansion(6)
                q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
                sage: eps=DirichletGroup(3).0
                sage: f.twist(eps)
                q + 2*q^2 + 2*q^4 - q^5 + O(q^6)

        ::

        NOTES:
        This function is rather slow when chi is not a quadratic character; this may be improved with a new definition of the Sturm bound.

It does, see line 460 of the patch. This is just a notational issue, one man's M_k(Gamma_0(N), chi) is another man's M_k(Gamma_1(N), chi).

I tested this and all test passed. However, I am not sure about the implementation. There is only one (rather trivial) test in the documentations. So I played around a bit.

Currently it fails if the form is a `NewForm` as explained in  #18086 .

It also fails if f does not have a neben character:

```
sage: M = CuspForms(Gamma1(13),4)
sage: f = M.basis()[13]
sage: G = DirichletGroup(11)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: f.twist(chi)
```

gives `ValueError: Form is not an eigenvector for <2>`

Similarly it fails when the character has values outside the field of coefficients of f:

```
sage: M = CuspForms(Gamma0(37),2)
sage: f = M.0
sage: G = DirichletGroup(11)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: chi
Dirichlet character modulo 11 of conductor 11 mapping 2 |--> zeta10
sage: f.twist(chi)
```

returns `ValueError: No coercion defined`.

Now some of these problems may be due to user choosing bad input. But that should be checked in the function or (at the least) be documented. Alas, I revert it to needs work.

However I do thank you for picking up this old ticket and working on it. I really would like to see this work in Sage. Thanks for picking up on David Loeffler's comments.

Replying to [wuthrich](#comment%3A20):

Thanks!

> Currently it fails if the form is a `NewForm` as explained in  #18086 .

I moved the method to the class `ModularFormElement`, so that `Newform` does not even have a `twist` method anymore until #18086.

Both of these should now be fixed.  I added different examples to the doctests than the ones you gave because they seemed to take forever.

Excellent. Thanks a lot that was what I was hoping for.

All fine and tests pass.
