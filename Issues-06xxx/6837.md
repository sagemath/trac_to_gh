In Koblitz's book "Introduction to Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms", Proposition III.3.17, it is proved that if f(q)=sum<sub>n=0</sub><sup>infinity</sup> a_n q<sup>n</sup> is the Fourier expansion of a modular form in M<sub>k</sub>(Gamma<sub>0</sub>(M),chi) and chi_1 is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo N, then f_chi(q)=sum<sub>n=0</sub><sup>infinity</sup> \chi_1(n) a_n q<sup>n</sup> is a modular form in M_k(\Gamma_0(MN<sup>2</sup>),\chi\chi_1<sup>2</sup>). This is a proposed method for objects of type 'sage.modular.modform.element.ModularFormElement' which will create f_\chi given f and chi.

```
def twist(f,chi):
        r"""
        This function returns the twist of the modular form f by the Dirichlet character chi

        INPUT:

        - ``f`` - a modular form

        - ``chi`` - a Dirichlet character

        OUTPUT:

        f_\chi, the twist of f by chi; if f(q)=sum_{n=0}^infty a_n q^n, then f_chi(q)=sum_{n=0}^infty chi(n) a_n q^n ([Koblitz]).

        EXAMPLES:

        Here is a basic example:

        ::

                sage: f=CuspForms(11,2).0
                sage: f.q_expansion(6)
                q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
                sage: eps=DirichletGroup(3).0
                sage: f.twist(eps)
                q + 2*q^2 + 2*q^4 - q^5 + O(q^6)

        ::

        NOTES:
        This function is rather slow when chi is not a quadratic character; this may be improved with a new definition of the Sturm bound.

* There should be an empty line before `... math:`.

  * I don't know why, but Lloyd's first names are transformed into 12. 10. 16. in the reference page.

  * I think one should catch the case when the conductor of the character is not coprime to the level of the modular form. Note that the if you twist a form that has been twisted by chi with chi again, the level should go down not up. I believe that the correct assumption are in [Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum].

```
sage: M = CuspForms(11,2)
sage: f = M.0
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(3).0
sage: fchi = f.twist(chi)
sage: fchi
q + 2*q^2 + 2*q^4 - q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: fchi.twist(chi)
```


* If the form is on Gamma_0(N) and one twists with a character modulo N, I think it should change the Nebetypus, no ?

I would contend that the answer should be returned as an element of the modular forms space of level LCM(N, N'M, M<sup>2</sup>) where N is the level of f, N' is the conductor of the character of f, and M is the conductor of the character we're twisting by. This is more or less the best bound you can get without knowing more about f; see Atkin and Li, \"Twists of newforms and pseudo-eigenvalues of W-operators\".

Note that the if you twist a form that has been twisted by chi with chi again, the level should go down not up. I believe that the correct assumption are in [Mazur-Tate-Teitelbaum].

I don't agree: twisting by chi and then by chi<sup>-1</sup> shouldn't give the original answer back again, it should give some oldform at possibly higher level, whose q-expansion has zeros at coefficients that aren't prime to the conductor of chi. Looking for some associated minimal-level form is tempting, but it's not going to make sense when the original form f is not an eigenform.

There is a question, however, as to what level the answer should be returned at when M and N are not coprime. I would contend that the answer should be returned as an element of the modular forms space of level LCM(N, N'M, M<sup>2</sup>) where N is the level of f, N' is the conductor of the character of f, and M is the conductor of the character we're twisting by. This is more or less the best bound you can get without knowing more about f; see Atkin and Li, "Twists of newforms and pseudo-eigenvalues of W-operators". (Perhaps there should be an optional argument for what level to look in, so the user can override the default.)

> * If the form is on Gamma_0(N) and one twists with a character modulo N, I think it should change the Nebetypus, no ?

It does, see line 460 of the patch. This is just a notational issue, one man's M_k(Gamma_0(N), chi) is another man's M_k(Gamma_1(N), chi).

I can fix this of course, but why is it bad?  The file is declared as utf-8 on the first line.

I tested this and all test passed. However, I am not sure about the implementation. There is only one (rather trivial) test in the documentations. So I played around a bit.

Currently it fails if the form is a `NewForm` as explained in  #18086 .

It also fails if f does not have a neben character:

```
sage: M = CuspForms(Gamma1(13),4)
sage: f = M.basis()[13]
sage: G = DirichletGroup(11)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: f.twist(chi)
```

gives `ValueError: Form is not an eigenvector for <2>`

Similarly it fails when the character has values outside the field of coefficients of f:

```
sage: M = CuspForms(Gamma0(37),2)
sage: f = M.0
sage: G = DirichletGroup(11)
sage: chi = G.0
sage: chi
Dirichlet character modulo 11 of conductor 11 mapping 2 |--> zeta10
sage: f.twist(chi)
```

returns `ValueError: No coercion defined`.

Now some of these problems may be due to user choosing bad input. But that should be checked in the function or (at the least) be documented. Alas, I revert it to needs work.

However I do thank you for picking up this old ticket and working on it. I really would like to see this work in Sage. Thanks for picking up on David Loeffler's comments.

Thanks!

I moved the method to the class `ModularFormElement`, so that `Newform` does not even have a `twist` method anymore until #18086.

Both of these should now be fixed.  I added different examples to the doctests than the ones you gave because they seemed to take forever.
