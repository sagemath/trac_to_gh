```
If a symbolic expression contains  symbolic derivative then
checking whether it is zero, raises error:

```
sage: x.diff(x,2).is_zero()
True

sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: f(x).diff(x).is_zero()
....
NotImplementedError: derivative
```

This fails because new symbolics tries to convert it to maxima
expression for checking the relation.

**Update:**

***** A patch to fix the issue is attached. The patch 
adds a new method ".has_fderivative()" for symbolic expressions 
and in `__nonzero__` method adds a check whether it has fderivative.

**Comments**  (for future works):
A simple timing comparison that illustrates why we should
avoid calling maxima to assert nonzero even for symbolic 
functions

```
sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: timeit('sin(f(x)).is_zero()')
5 loops, best of 3: 85.8 ms per loop
sage: timeit('sin(f(x).diff(x)).is_zero()')
625 loops, best of 3: 132 µs per loop
```  

It seems pynac is 400 times faster than maxima in this case.

Unfortunately, the fact that an expression contains a symbolic derivative doesn't guarantee that it is nonzero:

```
sage: t = f(x).derivative(x)
sage: (x*t +(1-x)*t - t)
-(x - 1)*D[1](f)(x) + x*D[1](f)(x) - D[1](f)(x)
sage: (x*t +(1-x)*t - t).collect(x)
0
```

The right fix for this is to either implement the `.derivative()` method in `sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py` or to change pynac to allow different parents in `evalf()`, so that conversion to `CIF` can be done without the code in `expression_conversions.pyx`. 

I was planning to do this for #6243, but ended up using a different/better fix there.

This is fixed by #7490, since we don't use the `expression_conversions` module to convert to `RIF` any more.

[attachment:trac_6523-derivative_is_zero.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6523/trac_6523-derivative_is_zero.patch) adds a doctest with the example in the description.
