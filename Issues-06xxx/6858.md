Hmmm.. I may have done something wrong, but here is what I tried 

```
sage: g=PermutationGroup([(i+1,j+1) for i in range(5) for j in range(5) if j!=i])
sage: (1,2) in g
True
sage: (2,3) in g
True
sage: g.cayley_graph(connecting_set=[(1,2),(2,3)])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```

Even though it's apparent I know very few about groups in Sage as I had to build S_n by enumerating generators ( I guess there is a command to do that with only the cardinal ? ) ^^;

Applies fine, documented,does its job.... Positive review ! ;-)

When testing the patch, I tried ( among others ) :

```
sage: len(g.cayley_graph(connecting_set=[(1,2)]).connected_components())
60
sage: len(g.cayley_graph(connecting_set=[(1,2),(2,3)]).connected_components())
20
sage: len(g.cayley_graph(connecting_set=[(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)]).connected_components())
5
```

If you think it useful, it could also be included in the examples contained in the docstring, even though there are already two and it may not be necessary at all :-)
