<a id='comment:5'></a>Source code looks good and the documentation looks good.  I'm attaching a referee's patch which looks large, but the large majority of which contains repetitions of two changes: "EXAMPLE::" --> "EXAMPLES::" and ".::" --> ". ::" (a period followed by :: produces ".:" in the Sphinx documentation, while if you insert a space, no colons are printed).  Of the other changes, I think the only one worth mentioning is that I changed instances of the "param" command used in polynomial_singular_interface.py to INPUT blocks, for consistency with the rest of the documentation.

I don't think my patch needs much review, but I'll keep this marked as "needs review".  davidloeffler's two patches get positive reviews from me; if my patch is okay, the whole thing gets a positive review.
