The patch `trac_5793-cliquer-flattened.patch` at #5793 contains non-ASCII characters. This can result in errors and warning messages when loading Sage. Patches should only use ASCII characters. The offending characters from that patch are

```
Östergård

The attached patch `trac_6674-use-ascii.patch` changes that to "Ostergard". It also fixes referencing so that `[NisOst2003]` appears as a hyperlink in the HTML version of the reference manual, as it should be. This patch is based on Sage 4.1.1.rc0 and depends on #5793.



Nathann: Can I ask you to review this? The ASCII character issue needs to be fixed before releasing Sage 4.1.1.

Hello !!

Actually, I can not apply this patch as I have nothing in my graph.py similar to what your patch tries to replace. I may be using some different version of cliquer. And I look through the patches send by rlm without finding where I stopped

I am currently downloading http://ftp.sh.cvut.cz/MIRRORS/sagemath/src/sage-4.1.tar which I will then compile and upgrade to test this patch. However, it is likely that it will take something like 6~7 hours and I will not be able to give you an answer until then.... Sorry !!! ;-)

If you have an account on sage.math, you can get all source and binary releases of the 4.1.1 release cycle at

The new patch should have removed all non-ASCII characters. It also removes duplicate citations. That is, don't redefine a reference for each function. Only define a reference once. If you then need to refer to that reference, then use a shorthand notation to refer to that reference. That way, it wouldn't result in warnings when building the reference manual.

Here are the steps to see the warnings caused by patches or library files with non-ASCII characters:
1. Take a binary or source version of Sage 4.1.1.rc0.
2. Apply the patches `trac_5793-cliquer-flattened.patch` and `trac_5793-part-6.patch` at ticket #5793. Install the package http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/cliquer-1.2.spkg .
3. Run Sage with `./sage -br main` and exit Sage.
4. Make an experimental binary version of the patched repository with `./sage -bdist 4.1.1.rc0-exp`. The resulting binary can be found in `SAGE_ROOT/dist`.
5. Extract the resulting binary and run it with `./sage`. You would see something similar to:

```

This patch fails to apply on my version, and I am afraid I do not know where it comes from. As I still have no answer from William Stein for an account on sage.math, I hope somebody else will be able to try it !
The odd thing is that I am asked to enter the "list of the changes" when I apply the patch, as if I were committing it !
