This was clearly *never* tested, since eval always returns a string (it can't return nothing).

I still get an error with sage -t -long --optional devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/plotting.rst, although it is with a return value of '0' instead of '1'. It passes sage -tp 1 SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/ for me as well. 

The odd thing is that if I try the test from the sage command line I don't get the string returned i.e. the test passes.  Or is it fine if 'sage -t' fails but the documentation is correct for what happens when you actually run it?
