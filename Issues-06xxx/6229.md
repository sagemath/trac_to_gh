This is a follow-up to #6043.

This nested loop is useless:

```
        P = 0 
        for i in xrange(n): 
            prod = 1 
            for j in xrange(i): 
                prod *= (x - points[j][0]) 
            P += (F[i] * prod) 
        return P

```

and should be replaced with (something like)

```
        P = F[n-1]
        for i in xrange(n-2,-1,-1): 
            P *= (x - points[i][0])
            P += F[i]
        return P
```

The patch contains the suggested fix by ylchapuy. It's ylchapuy's code, not mine, so authorship credit goes to ylchapuy. I'm just reviewing the code. Here are some timing statistics on sage.math:
