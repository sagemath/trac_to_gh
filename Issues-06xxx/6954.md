Two comments: first, this doesn't pass doctests, due to ordering issues in dictionaries:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py", line 257:
    sage: latex(d)
Expected:
    \left\{2\rightarrow x + \sin\left(y^{2}\right), z\rightarrow \left[1, 2, x^{2}\right], y\rightarrow 2, x\rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \, y\right\}
Got:
    \left\{2\rightarrow x + \sin\left(y^{2}\right), x\rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \, y, y\rightarrow 2, z\rightarrow \left[1, 2, x^{2}\right]\right\}
```
This is on a Mac, OS X 10.5, 32-bit.  Doctests pass on 64-bit OS X.  Maybe there should be different doctests depending on 32-bit vs. 64-bit, as in the `__hash__` method in `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx`.  (Or maybe it's not a 32/64-bit issue; maybe the doctest should just be modified so order doesn't matter.)

Second, I think I would prefer a colon rather than an arrow: I think the typeset version should mimic the string representation, just as we do for lists and tuples.  (I don't feel that strongly about this.)

I agree; we should have a colon, since there isn't a completely standard latex notation for dictionaries, and a colon will be less likely to confuse the user who is used to seeing it as text.

If we insist on having an arrow, it seems to make more sense to do a \mapsto arrow, or a knuth-style \leftarrow.

I changed the patch to use a colon, and added a seperate doctest for 64bit.
Unfortunately I don't have access to a machine with OS X, so I cannot test
this myself.
