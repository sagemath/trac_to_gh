Two comments: first, this doesn't pass doctests, due to ordering issues in dictionaries:

```
**********************************************************************
File "/Applications/sage/devel/sage/sage/misc/latex.py", line 257:
    sage: latex(d)
Expected:
    \left\{2\rightarrow x + \sin\left(y^{2}\right), z\rightarrow \left[1, 2, x^{2}\right], y\rightarrow 2, x\rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \, y\right\}
Got:
    \left\{2\rightarrow x + \sin\left(y^{2}\right), x\rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \, y, y\rightarrow 2, z\rightarrow \left[1, 2, x^{2}\right]\right\}
```
This is on a Mac, OS X 10.5, 32-bit.  Doctests pass on 64-bit OS X.  Maybe there should be different doctests depending on 32-bit vs. 64-bit, as in the `__hash__` method in `sage/rings/padics/padic_capped_relative_element.pyx`.  (Or maybe it's not a 32/64-bit issue; maybe the doctest should just be modified so order doesn't matter.)

Second, I think I would prefer a colon rather than an arrow: I think the typeset version should mimic the string representation, just as we do for lists and tuples.  (I don't feel that strongly about this.)

I agree; we should have a colon, since there isn't a completely standard latex notation for dictionaries, and a colon will be less likely to confuse the user who is used to seeing it as text.

I changed the patch to use a colon, and added a seperate doctest for 64bit.
Unfortunately I don't have access to a machine with OS X, so I cannot test
this myself.
