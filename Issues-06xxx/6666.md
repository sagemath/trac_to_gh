Thanks for the review!

I'm not disputing your changes to the whitespace here, but note that PEP 8 does not say that there should be spaces around *all* operators, only the relational ones.  From https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/:

>> If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator.

Actually, in the case of `c = ...`, I would personally prefer the "no" option or even `(a + b)*(a - b)`, which is closer to standard mathematical typesetting, but in any case this is a matter of taste.
