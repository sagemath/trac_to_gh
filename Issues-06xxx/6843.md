When trying to upload a .sws that contains directories with permission 700, the unpacked directories are still 700 and owned by the user running the notebook.

When running the notebook with `server_pool=['other_user@localhost']`, evaluating the cells then fails with

```
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied:
'/home/other_user/sage_notebook/worksheets/user/7/code/1.py'
```

because `.../7/code/` is 700.

When creating a new worksheet manually this directory is 755 and evaluating cells in that worksheet works properly.

I think we should use && instead of ; to ensure sure that we don't change the permissions of other files if we can't cd to the directory.

If tmp_dir() failed to create a directory we can cd to, tmp_dir would/should already have thrown an exception. If it doesn't, that's a different issue than the one this patch addresses, and should be solved by fixing tmp_dir, in my opinion.
