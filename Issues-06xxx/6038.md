Attachment: **[trac6038.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6038/trac6038.patch.gz)**

(This patch is based on Sage 4.0.rc0.)

In order to make the automatically generated reference documentation clearer, I moved the implicit_plot3d() function into a separate file called "implicit_plot3d.py". I see this has been done for some of the other plotting functions as well. I also took the liberty of adding a little bit to the meager section on "Three-Dimensional Plots" in the tour of Sage.
