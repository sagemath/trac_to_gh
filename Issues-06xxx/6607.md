<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

This has been sitting for a while and got some bitrot.  It doesn't apply cleanly against sage-4.2.

Preston, can you rebase it on sage-4.2?  I'll try to review it quickly after that so you don't have to do this again.

Actually, while you're at it, do you want to just put up a new standalone patch?  As it stands now, quad.patch is dependent on 12538.patch.
