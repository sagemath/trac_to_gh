Example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQbar,[1,0])
sage: E.base_field()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/jec/sage/isog50.py in <module>()

AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_generic' object has no attribute 'base_field'
```

This is because the curve constructed is an ell_generic and not an ell_field, despite {{{QQbar.is_field()}} returning True.

Similarly with RR and CC in place of QQbar.

All that is required is a two-line addition around line 213 of elliptic_curves/constructor.py.

Patch up soon.
