In sage-4.0.1, most of the primitive functions suffer from
inconsistence typsettings. For example:

```
f = arcsin
latex( f ); latex( f(x) ); latex( f(x,1) )

\sin^{-1}
\arcsin\left(x\right)
\mbox{\sin^{-1}}\left(x\right)
```

Note that the same function is being typeset differently. The additional "\mbox" in third case (which has been reported in
#6268) will get resolved by #5711. 

However, second case seems weird to me, given "class Function_arcsin" (sage.functions.trig) clearly defines its 
latex expression to be "\sin^{-1}". So it seems to be a pynac issue.

One can try following to see the issues for other functions

```
# Trigonometric functions
lst = [sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc, arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccot, arcsec, arccsc]  

# view
for fn in lst:
    view( fn ); view( fn(x) ); view( fn(x,1) )
    
# latex
for fn in lst:
    latex( fn ); latex( fn(x) ); latex( fn(x,1) )
```
 
and

```
# Hyperbolic functions
lst = [sinh, cosh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh, arccoth, arcsech, arccsch ] 

# view
for fn in lst:
    view( fn ); view( fn(x) ); view( fn(x,1) )
    
# latex
for fn in lst:
    latex( fn ); latex( fn(x) ); latex( fn(x,1) )
```

It seems, out of these 24 functions, 18 functions suffer from inconsistence typesetting.


**Note:**   Unlike latex aliases such as "\sinh" (which
is alias for "{\rm sinh}" ) there are no alias such as "\sech".
However, this alias is used currently in "sech" function which leads to latex error. The function should be represented as "{\rm sech}" and similar typesetting should be used for "csch" and others.


**SFunctions:** In current pynac, default typesetting used for a symbolic function say "myfunc" is "\mbox{myfunc}". 

This seems highly inconsistent from the rest. If a function named "sin" is typseset as "\sin" (=>"{\rm  sin}") then why should another function named "mysin" be typeset as "\mbox{mysin}"? I guess, we should follow a consistent standard.

I am working on this at the moment, as a part of the changes for #6211. Thanks for providing this comprehensive test data.

I am not sure about using `sin^{-1}` as the latex form of `arcsin` though.
