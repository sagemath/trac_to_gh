<a id='comment:8'></a>This is more about floating point rather than real literal

```
sage: a = 1.0 * RR(2.1)
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
sage: RIF(a).lower() == RIF(a).upper() == a
True
```
And the last line would be true given **any** floating point (with 53 bits of precision).

Though, it would be nice to explain the difference between `RIF(2.1)` and `RIF(21/10)` in the documentation of `RIF`. Don't you think?
