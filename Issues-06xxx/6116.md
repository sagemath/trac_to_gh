And if you really want the real literal `2.1` to behave like `21/10`, there are a lot more bugs than just this one.

This is more about floating point rather than real literal

```
sage: a = 1.0 * RR(2.1)
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
sage: RIF(a).lower() == RIF(a).upper() == a
True
```
And the last line would be true given **any** floating point (with 53 bits of precision).

Though, it would be nice to explain the difference between `RIF(2.1)` and `RIF(21/10)` in the documentation of `RIF`. Don't you think?

The docs for `RIF` currently state:

```
 |      Values which can be represented as an exact floating-point number
 |      (of the precision of this ``RealIntervalField``) result in a precise
 |      interval, where the lower bound is equal to the upper bound (even
 |      if they print differently). Other values typically result in an
 |      interval where the lower and upper bounds are adjacent
 |      floating-point numbers.
```

and goes on to provide several examples, e.g. both with rational and floating point arguments.
