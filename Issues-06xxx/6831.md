Since PALP requires polytopes to have the same dimension as the ambient space, LatticePolytope class required it as well. This patch drops this requirement by storing an internal copy of the same polytope in some sublattice basis and using it when necessary to call PALP. Quite a few functions had to be updated, I tried to add new doctests to check most of the new branches of code.

This patch will be a prerequisite for some code for working with nef partitions which I hope to submit in the future.

Actually, I have written this patch after all the previous ones were applied, I am not even sure if it will work without them.

I'll check and rebase if it does not work for 4.2, but it will take me some time. 

Thanks for all the other reviews!
