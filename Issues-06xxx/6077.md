This just adds a simplicial complex method for the polytope class, which requires lrs to compute a triangulation.

Mostly good, but needs a few fixes.  I'm attaching a referee's patch which does the following:

- removes the 'verbose' argument, since it's not used

- inserts a warning about this possibly failing if the dimension is larger than 3

- inserts '# optional' flags on the doctests so that they don't fail on machines without lrs installed

mhampton's patch gets a positive review from me; only my patch needs to be reviewed.  With my patch, all tests pass on sage.math (without lrs installed).  With lrs installed, sage -t -optional passes on this file.  (But someone else should probably double-check this.)

Thanks for looking at this.  Let me apologize for being somewhat confused about it - I have code in development for doing triangulations with lrs, but currently Sage doesn't use this.  So the warning about possibly not working in high dimensions is good, but I can also delete the check for lrs until I merge that code in.

Anyway, I have added a new patch "6077_v2.patch" which does not depend on the others and should account for the above comments and corrections.

Looks good to me. Passes all tests (without lrs installed, which shouldn't be relevant anymore).
