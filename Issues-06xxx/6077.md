This just adds a simplicial complex method for the polytope class, which requires lrs to compute a triangulation.

Mostly good, but needs a few fixes.  I'm attaching a referee's patch which does the following:

- removes the 'verbose' argument, since it's not used

- inserts a warning about this possibly failing if the dimension is larger than 3

- inserts '# optional' flags on the doctests so that they don't fail on machines without lrs installed

mhampton's patch gets a positive review from me; only my patch needs to be reviewed.  With my patch, all tests pass on sage.math (without lrs installed).  With lrs installed, sage -t -optional passes on this file.  (But someone else should probably double-check this.)

Thanks for looking at this.  Let me apologize for being somewhat confused about it - I have code in development for doing triangulations with lrs, but currently Sage doesn't use this.  So the warning about possibly not working in high dimensions is good, but I can also delete the check for lrs until I merge that code in.

Anyway, I have added a new patch "6077_v2.patch" which does not depend on the others and should account for the above comments and corrections.
