We can work around this by shipping and always using a custom cPickle, and hopefully this will eventually be fixed in Python itself, but a metaclass seems to be a less hackish solution. 

Another solution is decorators, but this requires a decorator on every use.

Thanks in advance for doing it.

Notes:
- Fundamentally, the two approaches work the same (fixing the name, and inserting it in the module).
  The only difference is when this occur.
- We anyway need to ship a patched cPickle for #5985.
- This is a blocker for a bunch of later patches.
