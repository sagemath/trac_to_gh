Here is a bug in the depth-first searching of a graph:

```

sage: D = DiGraph( { 0: [1,2,3], 1: [4,5], 2: [5], 3: [6], 5: [7], 6: [7], 7: [0]})
sage: list(D.depth_first_search(0, ignore_direction=True))                         
[0, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4]
```

It should be `[0, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4]`.
