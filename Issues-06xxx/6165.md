The spkg applies the patch given by Robert Dodier in this thread: http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2009/017242.html

Basically, it makes Maxima return eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue separately, rather than just returning a list of eigenvectors.  It makes it possible to determine the eigenvector associated with an eigenvalue when algebraic multiplicities do not match up with geometric multiplicities.  See the mailing list thread above for an example.

The new spkg is here: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jason/maxima-5.16.3.p3.spkg

The reason for this is to make it trivial to have eigenvector and eigenmatrix functions for symbolic matrices.

21:59 < wstein> yep, that pynac segfault looks *very* serious.
21:59 < wstein> ouch.
21:59 < jason> oh, grr, I forgot to add that file.
21:59 < wstein> but it is inevitable.
21:59 < jason> hang on.
22:00 < jason> it'd be nice if -spkg ran hg status and reported any funny things.
22:01 < wstein> good idea.  implement it and send me a patch.
22:01 < wstein> it's easy.
22:01 < jason> yeah, I know.
22:02 < wstein> my only concern about 6165 -- is this going to be upstreamed to maxima?
22:02 < wstein> i.e., or have you just made it so for the first time ever when debian sage tries to use the systemwide maxima
22:02 < wstein> it'll just totally break no matter what forever when doing eigenvectors.
22:02 < wstein> Just curious.
22:02 < wstein> As long as robert dodier is putting that patch into maxima, no prob.
22:03 < wstein> but he doesn't say so in the thread as far as I can tell.
