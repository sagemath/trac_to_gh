The preliminary attached patch (taken from the Sage-Combinat patch server) implements a variant of cached_function where the cache uses weak references. Again: preliminary: the test do not pass, ...

Feedback welcome!

The first planned application is for homsets, after the category stuff #5985 will be in.
