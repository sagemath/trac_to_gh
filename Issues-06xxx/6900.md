  Since pexpect is a very important package, I would like to point one problem that happens when DOT_SAGE is set to a long pathname, causing the SaveWorkspace("/path/to/$DOT_SAGE/gap/workspace-ext");
command in interfaces/gap.py fail (and possibly others).

  Sample test case to reproduce the problem:


```
% mkdir -p /tmp/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/.sage
<<make sure DOT_SAGE will point to that directory>>
% sage
<<exit sage>>
% ls /tmp/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/0123456789/.sage/gap/
README.txt
<<change DOT_SAGE to something like just /tmp/0123456789/>>
% sage
<<exit sage>>
% ls /tmp/0123456789/.sage/gap
README.txt  workspace-1328071335
```

  The problem is due to the command having more then 80 characters.

  Currently sage uses pexpect-2.0 (patchlevel 4). And this is also one special case in my rpm packages of sage, because if using the latest upstream, in my case:

```
% rpm -q python-pexpect
python-pexpect-2.4-1mdv2010.0
```

it works correctly in the terminal interface, but doesn't work correctly in the notebook interface.

  A quick and dirty way to test a newer pexpect would be:


```
% mkdir $HOME/tmp/sage-pexpect
% mv $SAGE_ROOT/lib/python/site-packages/{ANSI,FSM,pexpect,pxssh,screen}.py $HOME/tmp/sage-pexpect
% cp newer-python-pexpect/{ANSI,FSM,pexpect,pxssh,screen}.py $SAGE_ROOT/lib/python/site-packages
% sage
sage: notebook()
```

  After starting the notebook, and using a newer pexpect, try some command that causes a background processes to be created, like the first singular example in the tutorial.
A screenshot of the problem, that happens the first time a background process is started is:
http://img134.imageshack.us/img134/557/sagewithnewerpexpect1.jpg
but, as also shown in the screenshot, in subsequent evaluations, it works correctly in the notebook.

  Since it always works correct in the terminal interface of sage, I suspect it is an issue in the notebook/worksheet code. And in that case, it actually may be a different way to debug problems in the sage pexpect interface (also a suggestion :-)

  For people familiar with the notebook code, I think what may be also a good hint as to what may be wrong is that the extra noise in the output is not "really noise", but the "dancing" / and \ characters that go to the browser titlebar.
