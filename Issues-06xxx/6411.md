I think if you run a "sage -br" afterward, it will work.  There are just a few things that get compiled when doing that.  Looking at those, it should be easy to trac down what changed.

This is because in spkg-dist, we do the following:

```
rm -rf c_lib/*.so c_lib/*.os c_lib/*/*.os c_lib/*/*/*.os
```

This causes libcsage to be built again.  What we should do instead is delete the files from the tmp directory that we copy things into.
