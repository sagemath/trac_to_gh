    "body": "<a id='comment:5'></a>\n* There is no documentation for the function `smooth_triangle()`. Can you explain what that function does?\n  * There is no docstring for the class `FractalLandscape`. The function `__init__()` seems to explain what that class does. But at the moment and with the version of Sphinx currently shipped with Sage, docstrings of functions starting with an underscore character don't show up in the generated reference manual.\n  * There is no docstring for the class `TachyonSmoothTriangle`. A docstring for that class would be nice.\n  * Can you comment out the class `TachyonPlot` instead of deleting it? It might not be used and incomplete.

* There is no documentation for the function `smooth_triangle()`. Can you explain what that function does?
  * There is no docstring for the class `FractalLandscape`. The function `__init__()` seems to explain what that class does. But at the moment and with the version of Sphinx currently shipped with Sage, docstrings of functions starting with an underscore character don't show up in the generated reference manual.
  * There is no docstring for the class `TachyonSmoothTriangle`. A docstring for that class would be nice.
  * Can you comment out the class `TachyonPlot` instead of deleting it? It might not be used and incomplete. But someone might want to polish it up in the future.
