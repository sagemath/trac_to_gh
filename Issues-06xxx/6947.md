This current behavior of Sage demonstrates a bug, which probably also affects other complex valued functions that cannot be converted into real valued functions.


```
sage: f(x) = x^2                               
sage: g = fast_callable(f, domain=CC, vars='x')
sage: P = complex_plot(f, (-10, 10), (-10, 10))
sage: Q = complex_plot(g, (-10, 10), (-10, 10))
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input

The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (35, 0))

The attached patch fixes this. (It is a one character fix, but someone who knows the plotting code should make sure it is the right fix.)
