This current behavior of Sage demonstrates a bug, which probably also affects other complex valued functions that cannot be converted into real valued functions.

This looks great.  The reviewer patch just adds the tests above as doctests.

As another ticket, complex_plot really needs to convert it's arguments to fast_callable(..., domain=CDF).  See #6985 for timing examples.

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
