This ticket results in a corrupt repository. After merging this ticket in Sage 4.1.1.alpha0, I created a source distribution with `sage -sdist 4.1.1.alpha0`. Now compile that source distribution, then cd to `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main` and do:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg st
! sage/server/notebook/templates/async_lib.js
! sage/server/notebook/templates/jmol_lib.js
! sage/server/notebook/templates/notebook_lib.js
```
I'm marking this ticket as "needs work" and reverting it in my merge tree.
