Just manually force mercurial to install via 

   sage -f mercurial-1.1.2.p0

then type "make" (or "sage -upgrade") after that finishes to continue the upgrade.

I think this caused by a mistake in the spkg/standard/deps file.  These lines are wrong:

$(INST)/$(EXTCODE): $(BASE)
        $(SAGE_SPKG) $(EXTCODE) 2>&1

since clealry installing the EXTCODE package depends on mercurial.  It should be:

$(INST)/$(EXTCODE): $(BASE)  $(INST)/$(MERCURIAL)
        $(SAGE_SPKG) $(EXTCODE) 2>&1

```

I'm building Sage 4.0 from source on sage.math so that I can test upgrading from that version to the latest rc release of Sage 4.1.1. This should take a while to test.
