As of Sage 4.1, the NetworkX SPKG is named `networkx-0.99.p1-fake_really-0.36.p0.spkg`, which was the result of #4860 and #5934. Let's now rename that SPKG as `networkx-0.36.p0.spkg`. The updated SPKG is up at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/patch/networkx-0.36.p0.spkg

There is no substantial difference between that SPKG and the one in Sage 4.1. I merely took the one from Sage 4.1 and renamed it as `networkx-0.36.p0.spkg`.
