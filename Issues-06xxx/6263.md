The loads/dumps test for ClassFunction fails because `__cmp__` is not defined.

```
sage: chi = ClassFunction(CyclicPermutationGroup(4), [1,-1,1,-1])
sage: loads(dumps(chi)) == chi
False
```

Aside from wdj comments, the patch fixes the problem I was having with the characters of finite groups.
Does the  <  a shortcut for "does this character of G restrict to this character of H, where H is a subgroup of G"?

The GAP manual contains a section called [Comparison of Class Functions](http://www.gap-system.org/~gap/Manuals/doc/htm/ref/CHAP070.htm#SECT003), which reads:

```
So two class functions are equal if and only if their lists of values are equal, no matter whether they are class functions of the same character table, of the same group but w.r.t. different class ordering, or of different groups. 
```
So this is partly replicated here, except that the patch actually tests the groups as well as the values.

If you think it would be better, we can just ask GAP and return the answer it gives.

No, it just does a comparison of the list of values. This is what GAP does (see my previous method for more information).

Okay, it seems as though at least you are improving the situation over what GAP has!
