```
 sage: E=EllipticCurve([0,82])
 sage: tor=E.torsion_subgroup()
 sage: if tor:
 ...       print tor.order()
 1
```

We'd like to have tor evaluate to false in boolean context.

I assume that I only need to apply the patch `trac_6510.3.patch`. But why are there three functions `__nonzero__(self)` all of which are the same and reside in the same module, but each block of definition contains different stuff? For example, after applying `trac_6510.3.patch`, I get the following in `sage/groups/abelian_gps/abelian_group.py`:

```
    def __nonzero__(self):
        return len(self.invariants()) != 0
