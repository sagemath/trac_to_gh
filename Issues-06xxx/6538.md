Looks like there is a bug in Partitions.  Partitions(n, max_slope=-1)  should give the partitions of n with distinct parts, right?

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1).list()
[[2]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1).list()
[[4], [3, 1]]
```
But if you add the "length" keyword, it doesn't work anymore, at least not completely:

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # doesn't work
[[1, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # works
[[3, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=3).list()  # doesn't work
[[2, 1, 1]]
```

Fixed by making changes to IntergerListLex and not increasing algorithm's complexity. Fixed some other bugs in IntegerListLex and Partitions when bad input is given.

Thanks! I am fine with this change.

Still, I am pretty sure that the underlying engine is still broken; if you can come up with an example illustrating that, please add it there!

Sorry if I was unclear. Travis: I leave that decision to you. If you have an example, please add it. Otherwise you can put a positive review under hand.

I can't find an example right now. I've tried with max_slope, min_slope, inner, outer, max_length, min_length, and multiple combinations of them and could not get any wrong results.

If you're still looking for something that gives the wrong answer, use `parts_in`:

```
sage: [len(p) for p in Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2])]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sage: Partitions(10, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality() == Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality()
True
```
Another ticket?

Edit: I guess this is #12278.)

Yup: I copy pasted this example as a comment in #12278!

However, I was looking for an example giving wrong results while only using the IntegerListsLex engine (i.e. without parts_in). Thanks though :-)
