Looks like there is a bug in Partitions.  Partitions(n, max_slope=-1)  should give the partitions of n with distinct parts, right?

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1).list()
[[2]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1).list()
[[4], [3, 1]]
```
But if you add the "length" keyword, it doesn't work anymore, at least not completely:

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # doesn't work
[[1, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # works
[[3, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=3).list()  # doesn't work
[[2, 1, 1]]
```

Sorry if I was unclear. Travis: I leave that decision to you. If you have an example, please add it. Otherwise you can put a positive review under hand.

<a id='comment:17'></a>If you're still looking for something that gives the wrong answer, use `parts_in`:

```
sage: [len(p) for p in Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2])]

Yup: I copy pasted this example as a comment in #12278!

However, I was looking for an example giving wrong results while only using the IntegerListsLex engine (i.e. without parts_in). Thanks though :-)
