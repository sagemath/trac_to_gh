Looks like there is a bug in Partitions.  Partitions(n, max_slope=-1)  should give the partitions of n with distinct parts, right?

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1).list()
[[2]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1).list()
[[4], [3, 1]]
```
But if you add the "length" keyword, it doesn't work anymore, at least not completely:

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # doesn't work
[[1, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # works
[[3, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=3).list()  # doesn't work
[[2, 1, 1]]
```

Depends on #12925

It now passes the test for integer_vector.py, however the test in #12925 is incorrect since the partition [1, 1] has a slope 0 > -1. (Or am I now responsible for correcting this because #12925 has been closed?)

Have you read the text just above that doctest? It is precisely *documenting* this bug.

So, I am glad that you fixed that bug, but this ticket #6538 is responsible for updating the tutorial accordingly. Please merge back #12925! It's been delayed long enough.

If you're still looking for something that gives the wrong answer, use `parts_in`:

```
sage: [len(p) for p in Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2])]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sage: Partitions(10, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality() == Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality()
True
```
Another ticket?

Edit: I guess this is #12278.)

Yup: I copy pasted this example as a comment in #12278!

However, I was looking for an example giving wrong results while only using the IntegerListsLex engine (i.e. without parts_in). Thanks though :-)
