Looks like there is a bug in Partitions.  Partitions(n, max_slope=-1)  should give the partitions of n with distinct parts, right?

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1).list()
[[2]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1).list()
[[4], [3, 1]]
```
But if you add the "length" keyword, it doesn't work anymore, at least not completely:

```
sage: Partitions(2, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # doesn't work
[[1, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=2).list()  # works
[[3, 1]]
sage: Partitions(4, max_slope=-1, length=3).list()  # doesn't work
[[2, 1, 1]]
```

Fixed by making changes to IntergerListLex and not increasing algorithm's complexity. Fixed some other bugs in IntegerListLex and Partitions when bad input is given.

Have you read the text just above that doctest? It is precisely *documenting* this bug.

So, I am glad that you fixed that bug, but this ticket #6538 is responsible for updating the tutorial accordingly. Please merge back #12925! It's been delayed long enough.

Thanks! I am fine with this change.

Still, I am pretty sure that the underlying engine is still broken; if you can come up with an example illustrating that, please add it there!

Thanks,

If you're still looking for something that gives the wrong answer, use `parts_in`:

```
sage: [len(p) for p in Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2])]
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sage: Partitions(10, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality() == Partitions(10, length=6, parts_in=[1,2]).cardinality()
True
```
Another ticket?

Edit: I guess this is #12278.)

Yup: I copy pasted this example as a comment in #12278!

However, I was looking for an example giving wrong results while only using the IntegerListsLex engine (i.e. without parts_in). Thanks though :-)
