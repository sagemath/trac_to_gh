According to the docs, if fill is a number c, then: "a number c: Fill the area between the function and the horizontal line y = c."

However, the above plot just fills to the x-axis.  My guess is that it is because bool(2)==True, so plot thinks we have fill=True?

Hmm, given that this went into 3.4.2 I wonder why Jason did hit this problem?

Jason, 

I am marking this a potential dupe in the summary so we won't forget to close it assuming you can confirm it as one.

Oops, I must have looked at some permutation of "5438" then. Sorry for the screwup.
