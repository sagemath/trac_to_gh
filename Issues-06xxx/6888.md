```
the $SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-env has 2 small flaws.

1) the script prints the following message: 

```
    You must set the SAGE_ROOT environment variable or
    run this script from the SAGE_ROOT or
    SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/ directory.
```
even if SAGE_ROOT is set correctly.

2) if SAGE_ROOT is set to a wrong path, it doesn't stop,

The attached patch fixes them. 

I am not a shell expert, so please test it.
