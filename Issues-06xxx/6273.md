At the moment, random_element for number field orders returns a random integer coerced into the order, which isn't very useful. A much better solution would be to use the random_element method of the underlying free ZZ-module. 

More generally, one could ask for the same functionality for fractional ideals (and the above would be the special case for the ideal (1).)

I have implemented this.  using the random_element() function for ZZ and integral bases.  It works for absolute and relative orders and ideals.

I started out using the random_element() function for the module class, but that did not work in the relative situation.  It is a little strange that the classes for orders and ideals do not derive from free ZZ-modules.

I think it would be better to do

```
 def random_element(self, *args, **kwds)
```
then in the docstring say that the inputs are identical to ZZ.random_element, whatever those are.  This will if ZZ.random_element is ever improved, changed, or extended in any way (and let's hope it is), then this docstring won't have to change. 

Then in the call to ZZ.random_element, just do ZZ.random_element(*args, **kwds).  This shorter and more robust.

Expected:
    [3, -a + 1, (-3/2*b - 1497/2)*a, (-1/2*b - 499/2)*a - b - 499]
Got:
    [3, a + 2, (3/2*b + 1497/2)*a, (b + 499)*a - b - 499]
```
so it's still "needs work"

Let's just comment out both basis lines (since basis works, and it's essentially random).  Can you make non-maximal orders work with the previous code?  If so, do it and I will review.
