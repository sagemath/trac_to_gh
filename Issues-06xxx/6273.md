At the moment, random_element for number field orders returns a random integer coerced into the order, which isn't very useful. A much better solution would be to use the random_element method of the underlying free ZZ-module. 

More generally, one could ask for the same functionality for fractional ideals (and the above would be the special case for the ideal (1).)

I have implemented this.  using the random_element() function for ZZ and integral bases.  It works for absolute and relative orders and ideals.

I started out using the random_element() function for the module class, but that did not work in the relative situation.  It is a little strange that the classes for orders and ideals do not derive from free ZZ-modules.

Attachment: **[trac_6273-replacement.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6273/trac_6273-replacement.patch.gz)**

The new patch sorts out the parent problem ok, with suitable new doctests.  I note that you now delegate the random function for orders to that of ideals -- this means that the new code is *not* used for non-maximal order, unfortunately.  But then the same was true for my version.

So I would have given this a positive review, while noting that at some point non-maximal orders will need to be dealt with too.

Unfortunately:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-6273/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py"
**********************************************************************
File "/home/john/sage-4.0.2.rc0/devel/sage-6273/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py", line 1045:
    sage: I.basis()
Expected:
    [3, -a + 1, (-3/2*b - 1497/2)*a, (-1/2*b - 499/2)*a - b - 499]
Got:
    [3, a + 2, (3/2*b + 1497/2)*a, (b + 499)*a - b - 499]
```
so it's still "needs work"

Let's just comment out both basis lines (since basis works, and it's essentially random).  Can you make non-maximal orders work with the previous code?  If so, do it and I will review.
