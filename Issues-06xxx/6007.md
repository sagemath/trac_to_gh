REFEREE REPORT



The patch `trac_6007.patch` applies fine against the "post-final" version sage-3.4.2, all doctests pass with the options `-t -long`, and the doctest coverage is 100% as claimed. The reference manual built OK, but note that `sage/plot/primitive.py` is not included in the reference manual, so you can't search for the module in it.



On the side of pedantry, the patch introduces a trivial inconsistency in how "two-dimensional" and "three-dimensional" are abbreviated. So all such references in the module `sage/plot/primitive.py` now follow the forms `2D` and `3D`. Apart from this trivial issue of inconsistency which is fixed in `trac_6007-reviewer.patch`, positive review for kcrisman's patch. Only my patch needs to be reviewed.
