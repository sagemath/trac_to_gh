After the merge of #5799, we have jsMath installed in two places: `$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript` **and** `$SAGE_DOC/common/static`.  Moreover, all of jsMath is under version control in the Sage library.  However, the standard practice for Sage development is to keep most upstream spkg code out of Mercurial's reach.

In particular, we'll need to do unnecessary extra work when we upgrade to new upstream versions of jsMath or keep track of local customizations (cf. #4714).

This [alternative patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6614/trac_6614-jsmath_repo.patch.gz) deletes `doc/common/static/jsmath` and adds jsMath to `doc/common/conf.py`'s list of `html_static_path`s.

Since Sphinx recursively copies the only the contents of the static paths, jsMath no longer gets its own directory in `_static`.  I've changed `jsmath_path` to `'easy/load.js'`.

If we take this approach, then I should update the "`new_scripts`" patch at #6187.

The new version *prepends* jsMath's path to `html_static_path`, so that custom files copied subsequently from, e.g., `doc/common/static`,  can override certain settings, at our option.

The same caveats apply.

An aside on Firefox's security policy:

* Build the reference manual with `--jsmath`.
* Browse to the table of contents in FF 3.5.
* Open "The Steenrod algebra", say, in a new background tab by middle-clicking (or the equivalent).
* Switch to the new tab.  Did jsMath process the page?  Not for me.
* Switch back to the ToC tab and browse directly to the same topic.  Did jsMath process the page?  Yes for me.

I've tested this only on Linux.  Opera and Chromium don't behave this way, so I don't think it's [entirely] jsMath's fault.

In any case, this happens whether or not I apply the patch above.

> Since Sphinx recursively copies the only the contents of the static paths, jsMath no longer gets its own directory in `_static`.  I've changed `jsmath_path` to `'easy/load.js'`.

Also, since the jsMath files all begin with "jsMath", we don't have to worry about name clashes (except, I suppose, the names of the subdirectories of jsMath, but I hope this won't be an issue).

Anyway, it looks good to me.  I did manually delete `doc/common/static/jsmath`, and the documentation build correctly, with or without the "--jsmath" switch, and jsMath was active when reading docs off-line and on.  The patch is large, but almost all of it consists of deleting files in `doc/common/static/jsmath`; the only "interesting" part is at the very beginning, the changes to `conf.py`.  The changes there look good, both the new stuff and tidying up the old stuff (using `os.path.join` instead of "+", for example).

I hope I'm not missing anything, but I think it gets a positive review.  Apply only [trac_6614-jsmath_repo_v2.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6614/trac_6614-jsmath_repo_v2.patch.gz).

We're working on Sage-specific jsMath customizations for the documentation at #6673.  

The screenshots appear to be missing, at least for me.

From the [changelog](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/changes.html) for jsMath 3.6c:

```
* Worked around another problem with Firefox 3.5's single-origin policy for
  local files that would cause jsMath not to be able to load external
  components.
```
This may address the "aside" above, unless it's besides the aside's point.

#6673 should help with the macros, but please let us know if we've missed any.

On the other problem: If Firefox is running on Linux, are the [updated fonts](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/download/jsMath-fonts.html) installed?
