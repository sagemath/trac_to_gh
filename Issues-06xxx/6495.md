Building the Sage reference manual can take a significant amount of time. Decreasing this time could speed up Sage development.

The patch is large, but most of it consists of moving files from one location to another, as described below.  A summary of the changes:

Changes in `doc/en/reference` — this is where the size of the patch comes from, although the changes are pretty simple:

- rearrange the directory doc/en/reference: for each file like algebras.rst, create a subdirectory `algebras` and move `algebras.rst` to `algebras/index.rst`.  Also create a file `algebras/conf.py` for the build configuration.  All of these new conf.py files are identical.  Deal with the contents of the directory `reference/media` similarly, moving the pictures to the appropriate subdirectory.
- modify `reference/index.rst` to point to these new files.
- reorganize `reference/index.rst` so it is arranged, at least somewhat, by topic.
- add intersphinx to `conf.py` — see below.  Also add the new subdirectories to the list `exclude_trees`.
- new file `conf_sub.py`, configuration for the pieces of the documentation (as opposed to the main `conf.py`, which is for building `reference/index.rst`).  This file is imported by each of the files `SUBDIRECTORY/conf.py`.

Changes to `doc/common/builder.py`:

- add code to build the reference manual in sections, and also to build the sections in parallel.  The reference manual ought to be built twice to resolve references now, so typing "sage -docbuild all html" will build it twice (along with all of the other documents, of course).  "sage -docbuild reference html" will just build it once.  You can also run "sage -docbuild reference/combinat html", for example, to just build one part of the manual.
- the different parts of the manual are separate documents as far as sphinx is concerned, so allow them to reference each other using the "intersphinx" extension.  (This is why we need to build it twice: the first pass assembles the intersphinx databases, the second pass uses the databases to create the references correctly.)
- to accomodate the changes in #11251, which don't seem to be easily compatible with intersphinx, search through the output files looking for "todo" items, and accumulate them in one master "todo" list.
- for pdf format, since it now produces 30 different pdf files, write an html file which links to each of them.

Other changes:

- `doc/common/conf.py`: add the intersphinx extension to the build process.
- `doc/common/themes/sage/layout.html`: fix a bug where clicking the Sage logo in the upper left corner of the docs wouldn't take you to the right place, at least in the local documentation.
- `doc/common/themes/sageref/`: add a new theme for the pieces of the reference manual.  This is almost identical to the "sage" theme, except for a little tinkering to the links along the top and bottom lines.
- in the main Sage library, change a few pathnames to media files in the reference manual, since those files have been moved.
- make the necessary changes to .hgignore and MANIFEST.in to deal with the relocated files.

The [attachment:trac_6495-reference_breakup.patch new patch] may make it possible to build and update reference manual chapters semi-independently.  I think we can use the [intersphinx extension](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/intersphinx.html) to fix the cross-chapter references.  But we'll need to build the manual twice, a la LaTeX.

To build just a chapter, try, e.g.,

```
sage -docbuild reference/algebras html -juiv3
```

Still to do:

* Make a combined index page and search page.
* Check that PDF generation works.
* Combine chapter PDF files into one large [optional] PDF file (with [pdfjam's](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic/firth/software/pdfjam) pdfjoin)?
* Use a specific LaTeX doc title in each `conf.py`.
* Fix the "Arithmetic Subgroups" heading on the top-level page.
* Use a visual, 2D layout for the top-level page?  Group by general area?  Add icons?
* Get a reply from [sphinx-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/sphinx-dev/browse_thread/thread/c8e6f0683c65930a) about making relative paths work.
* Build docs in parallel (cf. #6255) with [multiprocessing](http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html)?
* Replace the "website" PDF link?
* User-friendliness improvements.
* Encourage more compact chapters?  It seems that "Combinatorics" takes the most time and memory.
* ...

Here's a new patch, rebased to Sage 4.7.1.alpha4.  This implements parallel building, and it provides a great speedup, at least on systems with lots of processors.  For example, on sage.math, the time to execute `sage -docbuild reference html -j` went from about 18 minutes to just under 2 minutes.  The main idea is to build each module of the reference manual separately, and use the Sphinx [intersphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/intersphinx.html) extension to handle cross-references (so <code>:class:\`blah\`</code> will work in the algebras module, even if `blah` is defined in the rings module).

Remaining issues:

- The new build uses up more disk space than the old, by about 120 megabytes.  I don't know if anything can be done about this, and I also don't think it's a big deal.  (With the previous patch, it took about 1 gigabyte more, but the more recent patch manages to cut that down: in the previous patch, the `_static` subdirectory of the documentation was being copied, once for each module of the reference manual, and with the new version, a symlink is used instead.)

This was a mistake in the previous version: it was supposed to create a link from `reference/_static` to `reference/cmd/_static`.  Now it should work.

Good point.  This raises another problem: intersphinx doesn't easily pass todo lists between different documents, so I don't know how to get a master todo list for the Sage library.  Right now, I've put the todolist for each module after its table of contents.  I think combinat is the only module with any actual to do elements.

>   * During the sage build, I think we should then run the docbuilder twice for the reference manual. Perhaps this should always be done for `sage -docbuild all`. 


Done: `sage -docbuild all` now builds the reference manual twice.  I also added a few print statements to the docbuild process.

>   * Can we make output less verbose? The whole intersphinx output scrolled forever off my screen. Ideally, an interspinx failure to find an inventory file would only add one extra line at the end of the build along the lines of "You should re-run docbuild to get references right."


I've tried to do this when doing `sage -docbuild all` and not in general, but it may be suppressing too much output.  (In the first pass, all warnings are suppressed, including intersphinx warnings, and in the second pass, any warnings should be printed.  But in the second pass, it's just rewriting output, taking intersphinx links into account -- it's not reading the sources a second time, so it doesn't produce warnings about missing bibliographic references.)

Other issues:

- In PDF output, this produces one PDF file for each module, but there is no "master" file linking to them. I hope we can create one. Should it be an html file or a PDF file?

- We could perhaps speed things up more by breaking the `combinat` module, which is by far the largest, into several pieces.  This can happen on another ticket.

- I've reorganized the main index for the reference manual, grouping modules together by topic.  I hope it's easier to find things this way.  I wonder if we can get intersphinx to produce a master index for all of the documents...

- in the old version, at least on my computer, when I clicked on the Sage logo in the top left corner, it wasn't taking me to the right place.  I've fixed that.  Along the same lines, with the new reorganization, the other links on the top line look a little funny to me in the reference manual.  They looked worse before and I've tried to clean them up, but maybe they could use more work?

 Building the Sage reference manual can use significant computer resources.  Easing the burden could speed up Sage development.
+
+The patch is large, but most of it consists of moving files from one location to another, as described below.  A summary of the changes:
+
+Changes in `doc/en/reference` — this is where the size of the patch comes from, although the changes are pretty simple:
+
+- rearrange the directory doc/en/reference: for each file like algebras.rst, create a subdirectory `algebras` and move `algebras.rst` to `algebras/index.rst`.  Also create a file `algebras/conf.py` for the build configuration.  All of these new conf.py files are identical.  Deal with the contents of the directory `reference/media` similarly, moving the pictures to the appropriate subdirectory.
+- modify `reference/index.rst` to point to these new files.
+- reorganize `reference/index.rst` so it is arranged, at least somewhat, by topic.
+- add intersphinx to `conf.py` — see below.  Also add the new subdirectories to the list `exclude_trees`.
+- new file `conf_sub.py`, configuration for the pieces of the documentation (as opposed to the main `conf.py`, which is for building `reference/index.rst`).  This file is imported by each of the files `SUBDIRECTORY/conf.py`.
+
+Changes to `doc/common/builder.py`:

+- add code to build the reference manual in sections, and also to build the sections in parallel.  The reference manual ought to be built twice to resolve references now, so typing "sage -docbuild all html" will build it twice (along with all of the other documents, of course).  "sage -docbuild reference html" will just build it once.  You can also run "sage -docbuild reference/combinat html", for example, to just build one part of the manual.

(This is why we need to build it twice: the first pass assembles the intersphinx databases, the second pass uses the databases to create the references correctly.)
+- to accomodate the changes in #11251, which don't seem to be easily compatible with intersphinx, search through the output files looking for "todo" items, and accumulate them in one master "todo" list.
+- for pdf format, since it now produces 30 different pdf files, write an html file which links to each of them.
+
+Other changes:
+
+- `doc/common/conf.py`: add the intersphinx extension to the build process.
+- `doc/common/themes/sage/layout.html`: fix a bug where clicking the Sage logo in the upper left corner of the docs wouldn't take you to the right place, at least in the local documentation.
+- `doc/common/themes/sageref/`: add a new theme for the pieces of the reference manual.  This is almost identical to the "sage" theme, except for a little tinkering to the links along the top and bottom lines.
+- in the main Sage library, change a few pathnames to media files in the reference manual, since those files have been moved.
+- `spkg-dist`: when building the main sage spkg file, delete all of the autogenerated files from the doc directory.  This is important because if some autogenerated files from before the patch are still present after the patch, the docbuild process can occasionally get confused.

Good idea:

- [PDF version](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/6495/output/pdf/en/reference/) (this points to an html document which has links to the pieces of the reference manual in PDF format)

perhaps change "else 1" to "else 2"?  As it is, building serially (with max_cpus set to 1) is slower than the current system, because in the new system, the manual has to be built twice to resolve cross-references.

We could also change "pool" to just "Pool(cpu_count())" or "Pool(int(1.5 * cpu_count()))" or something like that, eliminating the minimum of 8 and possibly increasing the maximum.

This version still does `min(max_cpus, cpu_count())`, so it won't use more processes than there are CPUs.

I see lots of suggestions on the internet to set `MAKE=make -jN` where `N` is 1.5 * (the number of cpus), or 1 or 2 more than the number of cpus.  Why not here as well?

> As I mentioned on sage-devel, I don't like that there is an option to doctest in parallel, a different option to build the docs in parallel, a different option to build in parallel...

I think maybe two variables: one (`SAGE_PARALLEL`) to enable parallel processes, one (`SAGE_NUM_THREADS`) to determine the maximum number of processes.  The first could be "no" by default, and the second could be "0" by default, meaning use `cpu_count()` or `min(8, cpu_count())` or some other variant on this, the way we do with `NUM_THREADS` in `Makefile` and `sage-ptest`.  Then it's easy to turn on and off without remembering how many cores your machine has.

So then we don't need the environment variable `SAGE_PARALLEL_DOCBUILD`, nor the `Makefile` patch, anymore.

In any case, removing the files from `MANIFEST.in` is the proper way of dealing with this, as opposed to removing the files before packaging the repository.

What's the rationale for adding all these files to `doc/common/themes/sageref`?

Instead of always building twice, would it be possible to **detect** whether the manual has already been built once.  For example, if I want both the HTML and PDF documentation, the current patch would do 4 passes, even if 3 would be sufficient.

Okay, done.

I removed that part of the patch.

> What's the rationale for adding all these files to `doc/common/themes/sageref`?


The new structure of the reference manual, in particular the new directory structure, means we need new templates for the files coming from `reference/algebras/index.rst`, as opposed to the old templates, which work for the main file `reference/index.rst`.

> Instead of always building twice, would it be possible to **detect** whether the manual has already been built once.  For example, if I want both the HTML and PDF documentation, the current patch would do 4 passes, even if 3 would be sufficient.

Hi John,

What is the status of this one ? It this robust ?

I'm quite glad that I didn't stomp on your foot with #9128, but I may be right
now in the process on jumping high to land on your foot ;-/: I just dived deep
inside Sphinx and using `@parallel`, I managed to have the "writing
output..." part of the doc compilation in parallel. I've right now no idea how
robust it is. I'll put a log of my experiment on #6255. Also, it seems
possible that the read part could also be made parallel.

I'll have a look at it. Please do not hesitate to ask for some more
explanation on the hack I did with intersphinx. Is there a specific reason why
you doubt intersphinx will work for the other part of the doc ?

It doesn't seem to be a huge problem with LaTeX, since this never has been
solved since years... Though I never seen a LaTeX compilation as long as
Sage's doc.

I agree.

I don't think it will cut down memory usage in any way. I'd rather expect the
contrary. My solution seems to be working but since I currently for a sage for
every single file, a lot of time is wasted in forking. I'll try to improve it
tomorrow.

I don't think I really will. As I said I'll probably trade speed against
memory usage... I'll keep you in touch.

Cheers,

Florent

Like adding more modules and functions to the Sage library, and rising the "doc[test] coverage"... ;-)

That would be fine.

This is an *extremely* useful patch which should go in Sage ASAP. It
effectively reduce the compilation time to 10min on my I7 laptop. This is
brilliant. It will certainly prove more maintainable in the long term than my
parallelization of Sphinx expertiment. Though, I think we should discuss of is
with Georges Brandl (the maintainer of Sphinx).

I'm now reviewing the code itself. You'll find below some comments.

Florent

**Suggestion of improvement**:

- I think we should get rid of the warning on the first pass, maybe by
  patching a little bit intersphinx. Also, now the compilation is a lot more
  verbose. Maybe we should silent the info for loading the bunch of
  intersphinx load at least in `reference/*`. If you agree with the idea,
  I'm Ok to look at this one.

- Some directories are much longer than the other (eg: combinat) they should
  be launched first (or maybe in this case broken in even smaller parts). This
  could wait for another ticket.

**Some remaining problems**:

- Interrupting the compilation with `ctrl+C` doesn't work. I had to kill
  by hand the master compilation process. I'm not sure what we can do for
  solving this problem.

- On the main page, you managed to gather the todos which is great ! Is it
  possible to do the same for the index (mine is empty). The module index is
  moreover broken.

Hi Florent,

Your ideas look great; I hope you can keep working on them. I am happy with all of your suggestions. In particular:

- building the reference manual before the other documents is fine. I think that was your approach in #9128, and the original patch here built the reference manual last. I hadn't gotten around to changing it to build the reference manual first.

- I'll try to take a look at combining the indices, the way the todo lists are combined.

- further subdividing combinat (for example) is a good idea, but I also agree that it belongs on another ticket.

- I've also noticed that ctrl-C doesn't quit the process. Any ideas why? Should we run the parallel processes differently, maybe using the methods you suggested at #6255?

By the way, mpatel should get a lot of the credit for this; he wrote the original patches, which I've just cleaned up and reorganized.

Hi John,

Another reason to have this in Sage ASAP: #12878

I'm willing to help on this one but we need to coordinate. I'll be in Montreal
for the next Sage days 38 so hopefully will have so time for Sphinx. Do you think
you'll have so time on it in the forthcoming weeks ? Please tell me what I can
do to help. Here are a few suggestions:

- **avoiding to build the full doc twice**: If you agree with the idea of
  the invpicke builder, I can polish it a little more. Also the name is far
  from being perfect and I'm open to any suggestion.

- **Intersphinx being too verbose**: I don't think we can silence
  intersphinx a little without patching Sphinx. I can try to do it by some
  Monkey patch.

- **Parallelizing the rests of the doc**: I noticed that the refman is build
  in parallel but the other documents are build in series. We should build
  them in parallel too. I'll look for the easiest way.

Cheers,

Florent

Concerning todos (and maybe indexes too), I think I've found an alternative:
they are pickled in the files `environment.pickle`. Here is an example, in
the directory `doc/output/doctrees/en/reference/modules`:

```
sage: import cPickle
sage: f = open('environment.pickle', 'rb')
sage: env = cPickle.load(f)
sage: f.close()
sage: env.todo_all_todos
[{'docname': 'sage/modules/free_module', 'source': u'/home/data/Sage-Install/sage-5.0.beta14/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module.py:docstring of sage.modules.free_module.FreeModuleFactory', 'todo': <todo_node: <title...><paragraph...>>, 'lineno': 122, 'target': <target: >}]
sage: env.indexentries.keys()
['index', 'sage/modules/free_module_element', 'sage/modules/real_double_vector', 'sage/modules/matrix_morphism', 'sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module', 'sage/modules/free_module_homspace', 'sage/modules/vector_space_homspace', 'sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_element', 'sage/modules/complex_double_vector', 'sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism', 'sage/modules/vector_callable_symbolic_dense', 'sage/modules/module', 'sage/modules/free_module_morphism', 'sage/modules/vector_space_morphism', 'sage/modules/free_module']
```
So it seems that we can get them from there from the pickle concatenate them
and let sphinx output the todo list and the index.

I've a proof of concept which seems to be working upto two problems:

- The generated links to the "original entry" generated by `app.builder.get_relative_uri` is missing the subdirectory (ie: "reference/sage/modules/..." instead of "reference/modules/sage/modules/...". This could probably either be fixed by fixing the builder or playing with symlinks.

- if one recompile the doc twice, all the todos are duplicated. This could probably also be fixed by removing duplicates or clearing the todo-list at the right moment.

I think both problem can be fixed.

- merging the html indexes

It remains to merge the javascript indexes.

Please tests.

Florent

I've probably a way to handle cross-citation as well. They are stored in the
environement and I can get them to gather the link in the main reference
manual, exactly the way I gather TODO and indexes. It is just a little more
tricky because I need to redispatch them to the other documents. I'm
experimenting...

Hi there,

I just uploaded which seems to solve most of the problems we had here,
including merging of
- the todo list if this extension is activated;
- the python indexes;
- the list of python modules;
- the javascript index;
- the citations.

I put a need review though I'm quite not sure everything is ready for
inclusion into Sage. I do need feedback and people shaking my code to see if
it's robust.

Hi John,

Wow !!! This is extremely cool. Thanks a lot ! I'm sorry for my current
silence. I didn't had the time to look at your part4 code. I'll try to do it
shortly.

No problem. I just wanted to have some idea of the progress and forgot to
switch back to a silent mode.

> Also, I see this warning message; do you know if it's important?


```

```

pass through the reference manual.)

I'm not sure now. I'll though I had silenced this warning. Give me a few day
to investigate a little more. It is probably not important as the produced
index is correct but I may be missing to merge somme part of it.

Thanks for those rereading. I planned to polish more the code and try to get
some feedback from Sphinx and didn't find the time. However I now think that
we should let the code enter sage as soon as possible because it allows the
doc to compile on small machine. At sage days 48, with mguaypaq (see above) we
manage to compile the documentation in a seemingly satisfactory way on a 1GB
machine. Moreover its a requirement to the feature #12878 which I think is
definitely needed at least for huge classes such as graphs...

Thanks a lot,

Florent

I see one warning now:

I don't know what this means. The search index looks pretty good to me. Florent might have some idea, when he has a chance to look at this.

Then running `sage --docbuild reference all` produces warnings like

 Apply:
 
+- [attachment:trac_6495-all-in-one.patch].
+
+For ease of review, you can instead look at the following four patches:
+
 - [attachment:trac_6495-part1-moving-files.patch] — this moves 'algebras.rst' to 'algebras/index.rst', and similarly for all other files.  It adds `.. include:: ../footer.txt` to the end of each of these files, and it removes any cross-referencing information like `.. _ch:groups:`, since that doesn't work anymore with the new structure.  It also creates identical files 'DIR/conf.py' in each of the new subdirectories of doc/en/reference, except for doc/en/algebras/conf.py.  That file is created in the next patch so that you can focus on reviewing just the second patch.
 - [attachment:trac_6495-part2-everything-else-9774.patch] — this does everything else; in other words, all of the important content is in this patch.  (If you haven't applied the patches at #9774, apply [attachment:trac_6495-part2-everything-else.patch] instead.)
 - [attachment:trac_6495-part3-the-remaining.patch] — this patch takes care of merging the indexes and the bibliography.

Yes ! And thanks for your work and your patience. This is very high on my
priority list, but it has to remain after the list "things that must be done
right now" (such as teaching or meeting the dead-line to get money for
Sage-Combinat) or even "thing that should have been done
yesterday". Unfortunately, until the end of September, I will still be moving
a flat, so I definitely won't be able to work during the Week-End. I
definitely want to do this done ASAP. So I didn't give-up, but the summer
didn't went as expected and I had to stop working on sage for a few
month. Please ping me in the first week of October if I didn't manage to do it
.

Florent

Another approach to parallel building (not that we want to throw away all of this work): [a proposed patch to Sphinx](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/pull-request/108/wip-parallel-build-experimentation/diff). I don't know if using this proposal would affect Sphinx's memory usage, though, which is another issue that is helped by breaking up the reference manual.

It only parallelizes the "writing output" phase, not the "reading" phase, so it cannot be that useful.

Most likely not.

This is more or less what I did when experimenting on #6255. At that time, since I was building the whole documentation it increased the memory usage. By the way, we probably should close #6255 at some point as a duplicate of this one.

This is an answer to Mike Hansen:

He asked if the page url are kept or not. The answer is that they moved:
For example:

```
doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/symbolic/expression.html
```
is now

```
doc/output/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/expression.html
```
So the location is not kept.

there are several options:

1. use `.htaccess` thing to fix this on any particular website;
 
2.  write a script to look through all `href` targets in each file with changed location, and create for it a file with forwards;

3.  maybe sphinx can help in this business, I don't know.

In any event we do not want to keep the old links around forever, I think, so there should be some kind of deprecation being turned on.

The "latest" manual would then never be stable; independent of this ticket in particular there is always the danger of a module being renamed or moved around.

I don't think that you can really do this since it isn't guaranteed that all of the files that are in say sage/misc/ will all go to the same document.

I wrote a patch which adds small HTML files to do the redirect.  I've looked through Florent's code as well, and things seem fine to me -- trac_6495-all-in-one.patch and trac-6495_silence_warning-fh.patch .

If someone reviews trac_6495-redirect_html.patch , we can mark this as positive_review.

Thank you so much for adding this, Mike - I hope to try it out tonight and see if it works fine, but I doubt I'll be competent to give positive review.

Here is a question about all the patches.  There are a lot of functions (esp. underscore ones) in doc/... that have no doctests.  Problem?  (This includes Mike's new function, but is not limited to it.)  Hope this isn't evil to ask.

Fix that, and fix the docstring for the html method, and I think this part is good. 

The warning is still an issue, and I don't know why it still shows up during the second pass for the reference manual when doing `sage --docbuild all html` but not when running `sage --docbuild reference html` twice. Florent, any ideas? Does anyone else see this?

kcrisman, I don't know about doctests for all of these methods.

Hi there

I'm at the point where everything seems to work for me. I'd like to test this
automatically it I can't see how. So provided someone testify that the new
version of [attachment:trac-6495_silence_warning-fh.patch] works for him, I'm
ready to put a positive review here.

Cheers,

Though I don't yet fully understand why, looking at the other doc suggest that
replacing the three `:maxdepth: 1` by `:maxdepth: 2` should solve this
particular problem. I don't have time to propose a patch now.

To investigate this one I need to install `sage-5.7.beta2` which takes
time. Jeroen, could you give a some context for this second error. I've never
seen it but I only used `sage-5.6.rc1`.

Hi there,

Unfortunately the one week window for sage days I had is over. I didn't had
time to make any experiment, and I don't expect to find much time to work on
this in the forthcoming days (the new semester is starting and I'm moving from
one house to another in two weeks).

Anyway, I have a guess one what could be happening. The first pass of
compilation is designed to build the intersphinx inventory. However, they are
rewritten during the second phase. Due to parallelism, it is fairly possible
that one process is trying to read the inventory just at the time another one
is writing it. The more process you have, the larger the probability of this
happening. This explain why we don't see this on small laptop. I'm not sure
how to test that this is precisely what's happening. But if it's the case, the
solution should be easy: similarly to what I did recently for indexes, we
should deactivate the output of the inventory for a second pass compilation of
a sub-document.

Does anyone have time to experiment more ?

You just have to `strace -o logfile -ff` the build process, then you'll see who is writing to the offending file. Also, can we have a beta with this ticket? Too many patches ;-)

The issue was indeed that the object inventory was written to and read from parallel processes. Sphinx makes no attempt to update the `object.inv` atomically.

I've changed things such that
* the inventory build process outputs to `output/inventory` and does not read inventory
* the second pass then reads the object inventory from `output/inventory` and writes to `output/html`

Now I don't see any races any more. The first stage still warns erroneously about a few missing citations, but thats not a big deal. 

Also, the whole thing runs just shy of 200 seconds on my desktop (i7-3770K)

```
sage -docbuild all html

Elapsed time: 196.5 seconds.
Done building the documentation!

The `sat/index.rst` isn't included warning is correct. The sat subdoc was not listed in `multidocs_subdoc_list` (`en/reference/conf.py`).

The last patch fixes the unlisted sat subdoc and moves the citations pickle to the inventory dir. Also, write the citation pickle atomically to avoid another potential race. Now everything builds without any warnings.

Yes. Good catch on finding sat not being listed in `multidocs_subdoc_list`, by the way.

I'm pretty happy with the latest patches, but I'm not quite ready to give a positive review. In my testing, I'm not seeing the intersphinx warning any more, but I was only sporadically able to reproduce it in the first place.

With the current `useless_chatter` settings, on the first pass through the reference manual, I see two summaries

```
[polynomia] build succeeded, 1 warning.
[geometry ] build succeeded, 3 warnings.
```
The actual warnings are suppressed, though. Should these message be suppressed (or modified), also? Otherwise, someone might wonder what the warnings actually were.

I think it might be best to include every single patch, or else credit will not get assigned appropriately; for example, the old "all in one" patch combined my work (which is really based on mpatel's, but I don't know how to get his name back in here...) with Florent's.

Aha, now I understand! It starts with doc/en/reference/rings_standard.rst, adds one line and moves the result to doc/en/reference/rings_standard/index.rst.

Problem: The line

```
sage/rings/universal_cyclotomic_field/universal_cyclotomic_field
```
does not exist in sage-5.7.beta2.

In what ticket has this line been introduced? That would be a new dependency.

OK, processing the `LaTeX` files seems less trivial than I thought, and does take time.

Currently, I am seeing a lot of unresolved references, and one fatal error:

```

OK, the links in the pdf and the mathematics in the html do not seem to work.

For example, I am looking at the documentation of sage.structure.coerce, The Coercion Model.

I see

```
Coercions are canonical (possibly modulo a finite number of deterministic choices) morphisms, and the set of all coercions between all parents forms a commuting diagram (modulo possibly rounding issues). [Math Processing Error] is an example of a coercion. These are invoked implicitly by the coercion model.
```
in the html. It is fine in the pdf.

Both in pdf and html, I read

```
For more information on how to specify coercions, conversions, and actions, see the documentation for Parent.

class sage.structure.coerce.CoercionModel_cache_maps

    Bases: sage.structure.element.CoercionModel

    See also sage.categories.pushout
```

I would expect the "see the documentation for Parent" and "See also sage.categories.pushout" come with a link, but apparently that has been forgotten (bug in the documentation).

In the html, `Bases: sage.structure.element.CoercionModel` is a link. In the pdf, it is *not* a link. I guess it should be a link in pdf, too, isn't it?

For the links in the pdf, I don't know what to do about that. Intersphinx seems to work only in html, not pdf, or at least that's what I gather from [its documentation](http://sphinx-doc.org/ext/intersphinx.html). I don't even know if it's possible to put relative links into a PDF file.

Did you delete the directory `devel/sage/doc/output` before the first attempt at a parallel build? If not, maybe there were artifacts there which caused problems. Otherwise, I don't know what's causing it. What is your OS and what is your browser?

`openSuse` 12.1 Asparagus, and Firefox 18.0

And that's why I wonder: The maths is fine in the tutorial, but not in the reference manual.

I just observed: When I load a page from the reference manual, there is a message on the lower left corner of my browser, `Loading [MathJax]/jax/output/HTML-CSS/imageFonts.js`, and a bit later there is a message "File failed to load" (but too quickly disappearing, I didn't manage to copy the message).

In `devel/sage/doc/common/custom-sphinx-build.py`, you write

```
    def write(self, str):
        try:
            self._write(str)
        except:
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc(file=self._stream)
```
One should never use bare `except:` statements, because these usually catch too much, for example `KeyboardInterrupt`s. Use `except StandardError` if you want to catch all errors, or catch a specific exception instead.

And in `devel/sage/doc/common/themes/sageref/layout.html`, indentation is done mostly with spaces but there are a few TABs. You should use spaces consistently.

But most importantly: the code actually seems to work now! It still needs buildbot testing though.
