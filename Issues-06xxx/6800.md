I think although there is `combinat.species.series.LazyPowerSeries` this implementation would still be good to have, as the implementation in combinat misses many features included here. It is also needed for P-finite sequences. 

However, I don't think it's right to define all special functions anew: the ring or a static function should be able to create a series from a symbolic expression (interpreted as e.g.f.), and , in case of a rational polynomial, delegate to CFiniteSequence (#15714).

There were a few failures:

```
   1 of  39 in sage.rings.formal_powerseries.FormalPowerSeries
   1 of   6 in sage.rings.formal_powerseries.FormalPowerSeries.nipow
   1 of   6 in sage.rings.formal_powerseries.FormalPowerSeries.pow
   3 of   8 in sage.rings.formal_powerseries.FormalPowerSeries0.abel
   1 of   4 in sage.rings.formal_powerseries.decidable0
```
