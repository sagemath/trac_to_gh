This patch add the ISR() function for graphs. The Independent Set of Representatives is a generalisation of graph coloring and list coloring, but goes way further ! I tried to take care of the documentation, so you will find some more informations in the docstrings if you need it ! ;-)

This patch uses Linear Programming, so you will have to first install GLPK (see #6867), then the patch for numerical.MIP at #6869 ;-)

As the functions dealing with LP have not been reviewed, I prefer to rewrite the MIP class for Sage to make it easier to use. I will post a new version of the MIP patch as soon as possible, along with all the patches for functions using it.

Sorry for the trouble, I'll try to make it quick !

1. The doctest needs to be marked as optional.

2. There should be more examples.

3. Whether or not GLPK is installed, the import `from sage.numerical.mip import MIP` fails. I suppose this is a rather old patch, should `MIP` be `MixedIntegerLinearProgram`?

4. "rebased for 4.3.rc1" means 4.3.rc0 + #7640 + #7674 + #7673, all of which are merged in rc1.
