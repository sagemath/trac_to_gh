Ups,

I posted my findings on ticket #6362 instead of here. In short: the build issue seems to be solved, most probably the OS X "make" version is a bit too old for a certain programmer's short-cut newly used in GNUmakefile.in. Let's continue here -- should I repost my comments?

Cheers,

Thinking about it, I do repost my comments from #6362:

As contained in Sage-4.1.rc0, singular-3-1-0-4-20090703.spkg does not even build on OS X, neither 10.4 nor 10.5. Changing the line 201 in /src/factory/GNUmakefile.in:

```
factoryobj :=   $(factorysrc:%.cc=%.o) $(factorysrc:%.y=%.o)
```
into the following two lines:

```
factoryobj :=   $(factorysrc:%.cc=%.o)
factoryobj :=   $(factoryobj:%.y=%.o)
```
made the resulting Singular spkg build on OS X 10.4. But after installing it into Sage-4.1.rc0, Sage doesn't even start, it fails with:

```
ImportError: dlopen(/Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.rc0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.so, 2): Symbol not found: ___eprintf
  Referenced from: /Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.rc0/local/lib//libsingular.dylib
  Expected in: dynamic lookup
```
This might be due to the fact that I had dropped in the 3.1.0.2 Singular spkg before, so I am re-running the build from the start. (I doubt that it'll help, but let's see.)

For the record, skipping through the install logs, I spotted another error (this time "copy'n'paste") in the Singular 3.1.0.4 build scripts. In /src/libfac/Makefile.in, the two identical lines 157/158 read:

```
	-$(RANLIB) ${libdir}/libsingfac_g.a
	-$(RANLIB) ${libdir}/libsingfac_g.a
```
and it is obvious from the surrounding lines, that the line 158 should end with "..._p.a" instead of "..._g.a".

@mantepse: Would you please report the findings so far upstream?

I'll try rebuilding from scratch again, but now from my superclean (Mac OS X) Sage build partition with nothing in its PATH but "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin", no directory "/usr/local/" at all, and so on. Oh well.

Building in my "clean room" didn't bring anything new either.

But a Google search showed some interesting information w.r.t. Mac OS X:

```
__eprintf is used inside the assert macro, and defined in libgcc2.c:

#include <stdio.h>
/* This is used by the `assert' macro.  */
void
__eprintf (const char *string, const char *expression,
           unsigned int line, const char *filename)
{
  fprintf (stderr, string, expression, line, filename);
  fflush (stderr);
  abort ();
}

It then appears that you are not linking with libgcc.
```
I'm not sure whether it is reasonable to try to link dynamically against libgcc --- is this library available on Mac OS X also in the absence of the XCode Tools?
