I tried to use the Sun compiler to build Sage. Since it's more fussy that gcc, it is showing as an **error**

```
The dodgy bits of code are:

```
void
gcry_md_hash_buffer (int algo, void *digest,
                     const void *buffer, size_t length)
{
  return _gcry_md_hash_buffer (algo, digest, buffer, length);
}
```
and 

```
void
gcry_ac_io_init_va (gcry_ac_io_t *ac_io, gcry_ac_io_mode_t mode,
                    gcry_ac_io_type_t type, va_list ap)
{
  return _gcry_ac_io_init_va (ac_io, mode, type, ap);
}
```
The Sun compiler will not accept this, and so exits, aborting the build of Sage. 

Note there are license issues with libgcrypt too - it is GPL 3. See #6757

By looking at the latest source code for libgcrypt this code has been changed. It would appear the intension was to just execute the functions _gcry_md_hash_buffer and _gcry_ac_io_init_va, but not return their value. Here are the relevant functions from the latest release (1.4.4):

```
void
gcry_ac_io_init_va (gcry_ac_io_t *ac_io, gcry_ac_io_mode_t mode,
                    gcry_ac_io_type_t type, va_list ap)
{
  _gcry_ac_io_init_va (ac_io, mode, type, ap);
}
```

The code for function gcry_md_hash_buffer has changed a little more, but it is obvious the intension here two was to execute _gcry_md_hash_buffer and not return the value. 

```

void
gcry_md_hash_buffer (int algo, void *digest,
                     const void *buffer, size_t length)
{
  if (!fips_is_operational ())
    {
      (void)fips_not_operational ();
      fips_signal_error ("called in non-operational state");
    }
  _gcry_md_hash_buffer (algo, digest, buffer, length);
}

```

So I removed the 'return' from the code in Sage, and made a patch. Since this is just buggy code, and not-Solaris specific, I've made the patch on all platforms. It is only seen on Solaris with the Sun compiler, as the Sun compiler is more fussy than gcc. 

See: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/libgcrypt-1.4.3.p2/ 


Sinve there are some license issues here, I have not updated the package. This code currently in Sage is GPL3 - see #6757

Something is wrong here. Your revised version will not build with the Sun compiler. It gives the errors:

```
"visibility.c", line 702: void function cannot return value
"visibility.c", line 851: void function cannot return value
```

as it does not contain my fixes. (I appreciate I screwed up the package first). 

I believe the best solution is to forget about 1.4.3.p2 entirely, and produce a 1.4.4. Despite the web site saying 1.4.4 is GPL3, the code clearly has a GPL2 'COPYING' file.

Greatly appreciated that you caught this issue!





> (I appreciate I screwed up the package first). 

I believe you didn't mess up the package. It was messed up even before the start of the 4.x series.

Yes, that sounds reasonable. I usually go for the license file in the source tarball myself and also check on the project website.
