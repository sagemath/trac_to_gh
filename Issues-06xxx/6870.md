Here are two cases where binomial fails. I think it is not
properly converting its arguments to Integers in all cases where
it should.

This is a good idea, and somewhat surprisingly it speeds up very small binomials without slowing down biggish ones.  However, it does seem to slow down symbolic binomials:

Before:

```
sage: timeit('binomial(100,10)')
625 loops, best of 3: 21.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(10^7,252525)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.35 s per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(2*n,n)')
625 loops, best of 3: 60.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(n+1,n)')
625 loops, best of 3: 78.4 µs per loop
```

After:

```
sage: timeit('binomial(100,10)')
625 loops, best of 3: 18.9 µs per loop
sage: sage: timeit('binomial(10^7,252525)')
5 loops, best of 3: 1.34 s per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(2*n,n)')
625 loops, best of 3: 76.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit('binomial(n+1,n)')
625 loops, best of 3: 137 µs per loop
```

I imagine that in some applications with a lot of symbolic stuff that could be a problem, but I'm not sure.  Is it possible to put a catch in for expressions that would keep things more or less as they were there, without making the numeric ones much slower?

I think to some extent this is a correctness vs speed issue. Before
the patch there is an asymmetry in the checking of whether m and x-m
is in ZZ. So e.g. binomial(3/2,1/2) works while binomial(3/2,1/1)
fails, although the documentation indicates they should be equivalent.
For me it was very confusing when something like that happened.
The benchmark case binomial(n+1,n) benefits from this asymmetry. I
have thought about it, but so far I have not found a satisfactory
solution which will not affect the speed of binomial(n+1,n) while
doing the right thing in other cases.

The other thing my patch is doing is to check more carefully if x is
an integer. As noted this will be an improvement when this succeeds.
Apart from the above benchmarks, try e.g. binomial(QQ(10**7),252525) or
binomial(SR(10**7),252525) with and without the patch applied. This
part of the patch however is not as important to me, a user could
always use binomial(ZZ(x),m) when beneficial. Hence an alternative
patch is to just do the first part. This will decrease the speed
regression in the symbolic case.

No, we should be able to compute the second type too, so don't jettison that.  But can't you combine the two?  Checking type is not so bad to do, and then you can still always try to coerce later.  After all, at the bottom there is a special case check for reals and floats.  So maybe you could do something like

```
if isinstance(m or x-m,whatever.rational):
   convert to integer if possible
```

I did check, and the slowdown for symbolic ones is because of that check.  Checking for an instance takes about 1/10 the time.

```
sage: def f():
....:     try:
....:         m=ZZ(a)
....:     except:
....:         pass
....:     
sage: timeit('f()')
625 loops, best of 3: 34.4 µs per loop
sage: def g():
....:     isinstance(a,(int,long,Integer))
....:     
sage: timeit('g()')
625 loops, best of 3: 2.57 µs per loop
```
where a = n+1

I guess the point is that we should definitely have as many correct answers as possible, but that the slowdown should be on these admittedly unusual cases with rationals, which are less likely to come up than the usual cases.

But I have a problem then. In the situation where x is of type SR and
m of type Integer, consider the cases x is n+1 (case A) and x is
SR(10**7) (case B).

To handle these cases correctly they have to be treated differently,
but how to distinguish between them using fast checks like
"isinstance" and similar if using "try: ZZ(x)" is not allowed because
it will slow down case A?

625 loops, best of 3: 1.23 µs per loop
sage: a = 10**7-1/1
sage: type(a)
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
sage: timeit('g()')
625 loops, best of 3: 570 ns per loop
```
So even if a isn't rational, you lose very little time by checking that before you coerce.

If we want to fix only the rational case, that is of course easy to
do. I have two alternative new patches: one for doing just that, and
one which is basically my first patch but reworked to not affect the
case of floating point input (which was an undesired side effect).

With the QQ patch, it is unfortunately still easy to construct cases
that will fail: e.g. binomial(1/2,SR(1)),
binomial(SR(10**20+1),10**20) and binomial(SR(10**7+1),10**7) (the
last one takes a looong time).

Understood; I think I didn't catch what the salient point was in your earlier comment, but now I do, and I agree that there is no easy way around it.  My apologies.  

Here is my last idea.  I think that the .pyobject() method of Expression can catch this - because it returns an error for anything which is not a bare coefficient:

```
sage: def h():
    try:
        a.pyobject()
        return ZZ(a)
    except:
            return a
sage: a = n+1
sage: h()
n + 1
sage: timeit('h()')
625 loops, best of 3: 5.98 µs per loop
sage: a = SR(10^7)
sage: timeit('h()')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.89 µs per loop
```
The docstring confirms this performs as advertised.  If that doesn't speed things up, then I guess it's not possible :(

So if that doesn't work, your original solution stands as a definite improvement, with the changes you noted - put the rational check inside the already existing not isinstance(m, int etc.) check, before trying m = ZZ(m), do the floating point fix where you have it.  Oh yeah, be sure to add doctests for the SR(10**7) etc. 

Because in the long run, we should have more correct cases, I think.  If someone notices a really bad slowdown, we will have to write a very fast symbolic binomial or something.  But all of these are an improvement on before.  Thanks for all of it!

Unfortunately my Sage upgrade croaked, so I can't check it immediately.   I will try to do so as soon as possible.

However, what does this patch do with this?

```
sage: binomial(SR(3/2),SR(1/1))?
```
Trying x-m won't work on this.   Note that 

```
sage: type(SR(1/1).pyobject())
<type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
```
which means you may still want a m=ZZ(m) or rational check once you have discovered you aren't in the n+1 case.   I may have that wrong, though, since I can't actually try the patch out.

As for a trivial point, there is a misspelling of "coerce" as well.

The doctest failure I got above is due to a 32- vs. 64-bit issue. On a 32-bit system, it would report 217. But on a 64-bit system, it would report 222. These results are consistent for all the machines I have tested on. See my doctest reports for Sage 4.1.2.alpha2:

In all of the above reports, the doctest in question pass on 64-bit platforms, but fail on 32-bit platforms.

What you can do is get the patch `trac_6870-final-v2.patch` and remove the hunk:

```

1012	1012	        9

1014	 	        222 
 	1014	        217 
1015	1015	    """ 
1016	1016	    from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate 
1017	1017	    r = current_randstate().python_random() 
```
from that patch. The new patch would be the same as the original, only with changes to the file `sage/rings/arith.py`. As for my patch, you could open another ticket and put the patch there.
