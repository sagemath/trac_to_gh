I just uploaded a super patch (for sage 3.4.2) which:
- Demonstrates the use a metaclass call nested_pickle automatically on a class, *and all derived subclasse*. Potential application: put this on Category, and all categories would be handled properly. Same thing on Parent? Hmm.
- Fix nested_pickle to handle old-style classes
