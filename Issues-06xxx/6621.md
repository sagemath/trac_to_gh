Instead of `return w`, you need `return Permutation(w)`

Attachment: **[new-inverse.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6621/new-inverse.patch.gz)**

Positive review! Here are some timings:

For the permutation [6,7,8,9,4,2,3,1,5], on my machine, the timing went from 70.9 µs per loop to 24.7 µs per loop. (This is all "%timeit p.inverse()".

For [19, 5, 13, 8, 7, 15, 9, 10, 16, 3, 12, 6, 2, 20, 18, 11, 14, 4, 17, 1], it went from 
263 µs per loop to 40 µs per loop.

For [14, 17, 1, 24, 16, 34, 19, 9, 20, 18, 36, 5, 22, 2, 27, 40, 37, 15, 3, 35, 10, 25, 21, 8, 13, 26, 12, 32, 23, 38, 11, 4, 6, 39, 31, 28, 29, 7, 30, 33], it went from 923 to 64.8. So it does look like this patch turns quadratic behavior into linear behavior.

This is Anders' first contribution to Sage, by the way.
