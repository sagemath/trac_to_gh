This failure was first observed in Sage 4.1.1.alpha0.

If the Sun Studio compiler suite is installed, the C++ compiler will be at /opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC. This causes the failure below. note in particular the line, which shows the Sun C++ compiler being used. But only a line or two before, the GNU C compiler was used. Mixing object files between the two compilers is unlikely to work. 

It might be worth taking note of the error though. The Sun compiler is a lot more fussy than g++, so probably picks up bad code that g++ will accept. 

```

```
Here's the fuller output. I believe this is a SCons issue again. SCons on Solaris looks for /opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC and will use that sometimes. PolyBoRi did suffer this problem, but Alexander Dreyer has sorted that out.

Hi William, 

Using 't2' set the following environment up before starting to build sage. 

```
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $SAGE_FORTRAN_LIB
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib/libgfortran.so
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $SAGE_FORTRAN
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/bin/gfortran
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/lib:/usr/local/lib
kirkby@t2:[~] $ echo $PATH
/usr/local/gcc-4.4.1-sun-linker/bin:/usr/local/bin2:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin
```

note, if you try to run the Sun C or C++ compilers, you will find they do **not** work, since they are not in your path. 

```
kirkby@t2:[~] $ cc
-bash: cc: command not found
kirkby@t2:[~] $ CC
-bash: CC: command not found
```

That is intensional, since for now at least, Sage will only build with gcc, so the Sun compilers are not in the path. 

Type 'make' and you will find it fails at the point indicated, as the Sun C++ compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC) will be used to try to compile the C++ files. This is despite your path does not include /opt/SUNWspro/bin/. The path /opt/SUNWspro/bin/ is hard-coded into SCons - it looks for the Sun tools there. Why the hell it uses the GNU C compiler, but the Sun C++ compiler is beyond me. 

I'm just about to go to bed, but will hang around for 20 minutes or so, therefore if you have any questions, get them to me asap.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:7\" align=\"right\">comment:7</div>\n\nA few notes. \n\n* Essentially this boils down to one thing - the library code should be made to honor the settings of CC and CXX, and not pick compilers at random. Since I'd not specifically set CC or CXX, then the Sage build environment will set them to gcc and g++.

A few notes. 

* Essentially this boils down to one thing - the library code should be made to honor the settings of CC and CXX, and not pick compilers at random. Since I'd not specifically set CC or CXX, then the Sage build environment will set them to gcc and g++. (I do not know for certain if this code honors the setting of CC or not, but it certainly does not honor CXX). 

* By default, when Sun Studio is installed, it will create links so cc and CC are in /usr/bin, and so always in your path. So hacking SCons to remove /opt/SUNWspro/bin will not work for most installations of Sun Studio. In any case, that is not the way to right solve the problem. 

* There are numerous packages in Sage which do not honor the values of CC and CXX, but just use gcc and g++. That is annoying, but not a fatal flaw, as they build as long as the first gcc and g++ in your path are suitable. This is more serious. 

* There is a mixture of Sun (-KPIC) and GNU (-fPIC) compiler flags, but that should not be a fatal error, as unknown flags are ignored.

Great you have found those problems. The Sun compiler is quite fussy, which annoys some, but does show up bugs that other compilers ignore. 

However, building the Sage library with 'CC' will **not** produce a workable Sage, as the Sun and GNU C++ compilers use different name mangling. We must get this to build with g++. Hence hte library it must be made to respect CC and CXX. 

I've had some feedback from the SCons mailing list. It's 2:02 AM here, so I'm not going to implement any of these now, but hopefully later I'll look at resolving the issues. It would appear that SCons ignores CC and CXX, but there are things we can do. Some code snippets posted by two or three different people include the following.

Hi David,

I believe your problem is the line:

```
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ)
```
which imports wholesale everything from the shell environment. Try
removing this and your cxx=g++ override should work.

---
Your best technique is just to specify the GNU toolchain when setting  
up the Environment: 

```
tools=['gcc','g++','gnulink',WhateverElseYouNeed). 
``` 

That's portable across all platforms now, and will be into the future.

---

Or the toolchain you pass to the Environment when you set it up:

```
     if os.environ['CC'].contains('gcc'):
         toolchain = ['gcc', 'g++', 'gnulink']
     else:
         toolchain = ['suncc', 'sunc++', 'sunlink']
     env = Environment(tools = [toolchain, 'other', 'tools'])
```

That's very annoying, but one of those things I guess. Perhaps this bit of code needs to be Solaris-specific. Back to the drawing board.

That's an excellent idea and would be easy to do.  Basically we just change

```
if os.environ['CC'].endswith('gcc'): 
```
to

```
if os.uname()[0] == 'SunOS' and os.environ['CC'].endswith('gcc'): 
```
and we're good to go.

I'm happy to give your fix a positive review if you want to change it from 'needs work' to 'needs review'. That fix can only affect Solaris.

I've created a revised version of William's patch, which will force gcc and g++ on AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Solaris and Tru64 if the environment variable CXX ends in g++. (I chose CXX rather than CC, as testing for a compiler ending in 'cc' would match gcc as well as 'cc'.

The patch should also handle the cases of where the Sun Studio compiler is used on Linux or Solaris. 

I'll post it once it has been better tested. 

It might be useful to force a compile of c_lib with the Sun C compiler, and see if it finds any defects like the Sun C++ compiler did. The revised patch will allow that.
