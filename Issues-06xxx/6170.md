Automate the process of 

1. take a subset of patch from a ticket

2. merge

3. Run "sage -br"

4. Run "make ptest"

and much more.  


This could look like the following, though the first patch to this ticket should be much less ambitious and just do *something* useful.

```
sage: hg_devel.test(6738)

[[applying patches on trac ticket 6738 to the correct repos...]]

[[starting new sage process in os.system and doing "sage -br"]]

[[report any failures]]

[[run make ptestlong and report results]]

[[revert state of sage to exactly what it was before stuff applied]]

sage: hg_devel.apply(6738)

[[apply everything from ticket 6738 to all relevant repos -- basically hg_devel.test without running tests, and without undoing at the end;  would also place all relevant downloaded patches in a directory -- this is what Michael always did manually with the patches/ directory]]

sage: hg_devel.needs_review()

[[would query trac and make a list of all tickets that are [with patch; needs review], and would return a list of the ticket numbers.]]

sage: hg_devel.positive_review()

[[would query trac and make a list of all tickets that are [with patch; positive review], and would return a list of the ticket numbers.]]

sage: hg_devel.test_positive_review()

[[would try hg_devel.test(...) on every ticket with positive review and make a nice html (and/or text) based report summarizing what happened]]


sage: hg_devel.test_needs_review()

[[would try hg_devel.test(...) on every ticket that needs review and make a nice html (and/or text) based report summarizing what happened.   This could probably quickly indicate that half the tickets "needs review" are broken or need a rebase -- it could easily take several hours to run.  This would be incredibly valuable, imho.]]
