```
-----------
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
sage: symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string('%i')
I
sage: symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string('i')
I
sage: symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string('%inf')
Inf
-----------

So as you see, we are converting both '%i' and 'i' to  imaginary 'I' !!!!
```
The ticket should implement a multi word replace and use that on a symtable with additional entries `'e':'_e', 'i':'_i', 'I':'_I'`.

We do not want to be surprised when some new Maxima variable starting %i is introduced. At the moment it's really just a string replace from %i to I, without sense of word boundaries.

Indeed, because the patch at #8734 (needing review) only is about vars, and it will only help with the problem in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) if the then marked sage vars are renamed to some other specific string before output in desolve...().

Is `%inf` a normal Maxima expression, though?  They just use `inf` and `minf`, I believe, which we replace correctly.
> so I think the ticket should implement `multi_word_replace()` in `sage.misc.multireplace` and use that on a symtable with additional entries `'e':'_e', 'i':'_i', 'I':'_I'`.

I guess one could do so... I'm just trying to imagine cases in which this would be necessary due only to Sage usage.  If someone uses Maxima to create variables it's quite different.

No but we do not want to be surprised when some new Maxima variable starting `%i` is introduced. At the moment it's really just a string replace from `%i` to `I`, without sense of word boundaries.

Obviously the whole routine takes so long that the loop doesn't signify. That may be worth an optimization ticket alone.

Just put it in `symtable`, give it a special value, and ask for that value within the new loop. Having it all in the loop is more efficient than find every time.

Well, it's an improvement, though still not perfect:

```
# Before
sage: sefms('%inf')
Inf
sage: sefms('%minf')
-Infinity
# After
sage: sefms('%inf')
+Infinity
sage: sefms('%minf')
-Infinity
```
Neither of these are infinity in Maxima, of course.  And indeed here is what the [Maxima manual](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima_6.html#SEC32) says about identifiers:

```
(%i1) %an_ordinary_identifier42;
(%o1)               %an_ordinary_identifier42
```
"A numeral may be the first character of an identifier if it is preceded by a backslash. "  But I don't know that we need to translate all identifiers in Maxima to Sage here... I guess I'm torn about that.  

```
sage: timeit('sefms(str(ex))')
5 loops, best of 3: 2.19/2.14/2.15 s per loop (without #6882)
5 loops, best of 3: 2.13/2.11/2.12 s per loop (with #6882)
```
Of course, thinking about it, that string is a Sage string, not a Maxima string, so `%time R = random_expr(50,nvars=2); sefms(repr(R._maxima_()))` is probably more accurate, but that is also wildly variant on the expression.

Okay, as far as I can tell this will not break anything (let's really hope!) and fixes the actual problem without slowing down what is already a very slow process (even for `random_expr(5,nvars=2)` it's 2-3 milliseconds either way).  Step in right direction, and again most people should not be affected in the slightest.  If passes tests, let's get it in.
