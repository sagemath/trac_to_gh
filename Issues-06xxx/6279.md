I build sage-4.0.2.alpha3 on sage.math with 

```
export SAGE_CHECK="yes"

and it failed as follows:

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

This fails for 4.1 on sage.math. Looking in the tests directory, I see a couple "`Rout.fail`" files, and both complain

```
Error in .find.package(package, lib.loc, verbose = verbose) : 
  there is no package called 'MASS'
```
Googling around, it looks like we'd need to install the recommended packages: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2002-May/021259.html. It looks like there is a "--without-recommended" flag for ./configure, but it may not do what we want: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2008-April/049054.html

Sadly, you can't even get through the testsuite without the recommended packages.

In the r-2.9.2 spkg, the failing tests are

```
src/library/utils/R-ex/capture.output.R
src/library/utils/R-ex/ls_str.R
src/library/grDevices/R-ex/densCols.R
src/library/graphics/R-ex/smoothscatter.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/add1.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/alias.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/anova.glm.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/aov.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/dummy.coef.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/extractAIC.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/glm.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/nls.R
src/library/stats/R-ex/stat.anova.R 
src/library/stats/R-ex/summary.glm.R
```

as well as the test for (R) issue #2586 in `reg-tests-1.R` and
the test labelled `## as.matrix.data.frame with coercion` in `reg-tests-3.R`.

They seem to be caused by missing packages `MASS`, `KernSmooth`, `survival`.

Maybe we can just remove the failing tests?
