I believe there is an issue which *may* affect Solaris with polybori 0.5rc.p8, and assuming my patch to .p9 gets positive review, will affect that too, as I have not tried to fix this. 

Here are some notes I put in patches/custom.py


```
# Note, these 'SAGE_DEBUG' linker flags added by someone
# are likely to break if used on Solaris
# with the Sun linker, as -p option to the Sun linker is:
#         [-p auditlib]   identify audit library to accompany this object
# This has not been confirmed, and I don't have time to test it.
# David Kirkby, 21st July 2009. I suggest this is revisited by someone soon.
if os.environ.has_key('SAGE_DEBUG'):
    CPPDEFINES=[]
    CCFLAGS=[" -pg"] + CCFLAGS
    CXXFLAGS=[" -pg"] + CXXFLAGS
    LINKFLAGS=[" -pg"]


```
