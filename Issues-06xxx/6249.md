Let G1 and G2 be arbitrary graphs.  G1.plot() + G2.plot() and G2.plot() + G1.plot() (notice the ordering) look the same for me, ie I cannot make one graph appear above the other.

I'd just like to add that this bothers me too.  I once tried to fix it and got confused and gave up.

I disagree. If you do not specify the z-order then there is no good way of automatically figuring out what to do. Amongst the multitude of possible behaviours you could even argue that G1.plot() + G2.plot() and G2.plot() + G1.plot() should be the same as addition is commutative. 

Just do G1.plot(zorder=0) + G2.plot(zorder=1) or vice versa if you care about the z-ordering. 

I recommend to close this bug.
