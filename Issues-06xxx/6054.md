Thanks. Great patch. But the semicolon removal in the patch

causes sync issues on sage.math, so I am taking it out.

The patch I just posted replaces Mike's patch and also fixes the failure in 

```
devel/sage/doc/en/constructions/calculus.rst
```
that Mike did point out he forgot to change when he cut the patch. I committed in Mike's name obviously ;)

Cheers,

Michael
