This is a bug:

```
sage: plot(abs(exp(i*x)), xmin=1,xmax=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
```
The above should never happen, since the outputs of the function should be floats.   

Doing the obvious workaround yields another totally different bug!

```
sage: plot(lambda x: float(abs(exp(i*x))), xmin=1,xmax=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ZeroDivisionError: float division
```

The above ZeroDivisionError comes from trying incorrectly to scale the y-axis!

The following works, where we do two things explicitly, both of which should be completely automatic. 

```
sage: plot(lambda x: float(abs(exp(i*x))), xmin=1,xmax=2, ymin=0,ymax=1)
```

This was reported by Andi Walz on sage-support.
