It seems that Sequence objects forgot how to typeset themselves somewhere between 3.4.2 and 4.1.

In 3.4.2:

```
sage: res = solve(x^2-2,x)
sage: latex(res)

\left[x  =  -\sqrt{ 2 }, 
 x  =  \sqrt{ 2 }\right]
```

In 4.1:

```
sage: latex(res)

\text{[
x == -sqrt(2),
x == sqrt(2)
]}
sage: latex(res[0])
x = -\sqrt{2}
```

Attached patch adds a `_latex_` method to `sage.structure.sequence.Sequence`.
