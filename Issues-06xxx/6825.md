But if you run doctest again on `sage/modules/vector_real_double_dense.pyx`, the failure would disappear. This is an intermittent failure I came across while managing the release of Sage 4.1.1.

```
I can make the problem described in sage trac ticket #6825
reproducible and not intermitent.

If you remove

    local/lib/python/site-packages/scipy/stats/mstats_basic.pyc

then you will see the error when you run

    sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/modules/vector_real_double_dense.pyx"

This reproduces the problem whether or not you move the build directory.


One possible fix for the problem is to remove line 106 of

    local/lib/python/site-packages/scipy/stats/mstats_basic.py

which is the assert line about which the output message complains.


I do not know a lot about python, but it seems that
python evidently has some check that the sage tree has moved and
so rebuilds *.pyc files if they have not been regenerated recently.
I am surprised that local/bin/sage-location does not remove all the
*.pyc files and rebuild them when the sage tree moves.

We're already a version behind (we're at 0.7, but upstream is 0.7.1).  Would upgrading to 0.7.1 get us this fix?
