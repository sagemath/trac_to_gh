Mariah Lenox reported the following doctest failure when running the test suite:

```

But if you run doctest again on `sage/modules/vector_real_double_dense.pyx`, the failure would disappear. This is an intermittent failure I came across while managing the release of Sage 4.1.1.

I think this is probably an error in scipy or numpy.

I can make the problem described in sage trac ticket #6825
reproducible and not intermitent.

If you remove

    local/lib/python/site-packages/scipy/stats/mstats_basic.pyc

then you will see the error when you run

    sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/modules/vector_real_double_dense.pyx"

This reproduces the problem whether or not you move the build directory.


One possible fix for the problem is to remove line 106 of

    local/lib/python/site-packages/scipy/stats/mstats_basic.py

which is the assert line about which the output message complains.


I do not know a lot about python, but it seems that
python evidently has some check that the sage tree has moved and
so rebuilds *.pyc files if they have not been regenerated recently.
I am surprised that local/bin/sage-location does not remove all the
*.pyc files and rebuild them when the sage tree moves.

We're already a version behind (we're at 0.7, but upstream is 0.7.1).  Would upgrading to 0.7.1 get us this fix?

Yes, that's the bug.  I think at this point, it makes more sense to apply the small fix for 4.2.1 which should be out in the next day or so.

In 4.3, we can upgrade to 0.7.1 when we can get more rounds of testing on various platforms.
