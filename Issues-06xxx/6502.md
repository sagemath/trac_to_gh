Compiles and installs successfully on Sage 4.0.1 on Ubuntu x86.

The methods in MIP should have doctests/docstrings. e.g. I should be able to type

```
sage: MIP.addBound?
```

and see a nice example for how to add a bound.

I agree, this needs docstrings.

Installation of the spkg went fine on a macbook running 10.4.11. The patch seemed to apply okay. sage -testall on 4.1.rc1 passed except for failures in parallel/decorate (DeprecationWarning: os.popen2 is deprecated. ) and interfaces/sage0 (which could not be replicated).

The examples given in the sage-devel email (below) seemed to work okay, though I am not an expert on this stuff.

```
g=graphs.RandomGNP(10,.5)

p=MIP(max=True)

obj={}
for i in g.vertices():
   obj["V"+str(i)]=1
   p.setinteger("V"+str(i))
p.setobj(Constraint(obj,obj=True))
for (a,b,c) in g.edges():
   obj={}
   obj["V"+str(a)]=1
   obj["V"+str(b)]=1
   p.addconstraint(Constraint(obj,lt=1))
p.solve()
```

- solves LP using GLPK ( see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6602 )
- the interface with the COIN solver has been moved to a SPKG whose link will be added here
- Doctstrings have been added
- small modifications everywhere

Patch numerical.mip-2.patch applies on top of 2428.patch

I hope you will like it !! I spent a lot of time on this LP for SAGE ! ;-)

I usually debug by just running sage -t with the file open in an editor until it passes:-) 

Am I to apply MIP1 then MIP2? If so, there was a problem compiling (amd64, ubuntu 9.04):

```

These patches applies to an amd64 ubuntu 9.04 machine passes sage -testall (except for the already reported errors for sage 4.1.1.a1). 

Things are improving but there are some remaining issues:

1. There is a possible typo in the docstring for MIP:

```
        For example linear function 3 * x - 2 * y + 3 * z
        where x,y, and z are objects is represented as { x : 3, y : -2, z : -3 }
```

might have a sign error and should I think be 

```
        For example linear function 3 * x - 2 * y + 3 * z
        where x,y, and z are objects is represented as { x : 3, y : -2, z : 3 }
```

2. There is no example in the docstring for MIP.solve. There should be at least one 
(fairly simple and well-commented) and preferably more. Please check other 
docstrings for missing examples. They are *required* as part of the code 
inclusion process. Please read:
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings

They will use sage -i <spkg-name>, not sage -upgrade, on the bash command line.
Also, install_package('<spkg-name>') should work from the Sage command line or 
the notebook.

Of course, anyone can use 
sage -i http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg
to install glpk right now (or
sage -f http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg
to force a reinstall).

So I can't successfully run it in order to update any of the HTML pages that lists all known packages. But the good news is that you can be sure that the package `glpk-4.38.spkg ` is up on the optional packages repository.

The Python script that is used for regenerating the packages HTML pages is not working for me at the moment. So I can't successfully run it in order to update any of the HTML pages that lists all known packages. But the good news is that you can be sure that the package `glpk-4.38.spkg ` is up on the optional packages repository. If you can't download that package from the link

http://www.sagemath.org/packages/optional/glpk-4.38.spkg

please tell me.

New patch AllMIP-2 available.

All the calls to solve() are flagged optional. *This class should now compile even without the libraries glpk* ( which have been removed from module_list ) : all is left in this class except the call to solveGlpk, which is now a function defined in the new version of the spkg ( see #6817 ).

It is a bit better this way, as this was already the case with package CBC ( now, the code is "symmetric" between Glpk and Cbc, as both are optional packages )

In the end :
* To test this code aply patch AllMIP-2
* To install the new version of Glpk which is to make this code useful, type 

```
sage -f http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg
```

This spkg being currently reviewed at #6817 ( it should be pretty quick, there is nothing new in this patch except a function which had already been reviewed here ! )

But note that since the patch `AllMIP-2.patch` depends on an optional package, its doctests should be marked with \"# optional\" so that running doctests with something like \"./sage -t -long  /path/to/script.py\" would skip over doctests that require optional spkg's.

Replying to [@wdjoyner](#comment%3A50):
> I can only test this with glpk installed (having build problems...). Is that okay?

That is fine by me. But note that since the patch `AllMIP-2.patch` depends on an optional package, its doctests should be marked with "# optional" so that running doctests with something like "./sage -t -long  /path/to/script.py" would skip over doctests that require optional spkg's. At the moment, most of the doctests in `AllMIP-2.patch` require that the optional package GLPK be installed, but those doctests that require this package are not flagged with "# optional". See for example, this doctest:

```
 	39	         sage: ### Computation of a maximum stable set in Petersen's graph ### 
 	40	         sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph() 
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1) 
 	42	         sage: obj={} 
 	43	         sage: for i in g.vertices(): 
 	44	         ...       obj[i]=1  
 	45	         ...       p.setinteger(i)  
 	46	         sage: p.setobj(obj) 
 	47	         sage: for (a,b,c) in g.edges(): 
 	48	         ...       cons={}  
 	49	         ...       cons[a]=1  
 	50	         ...       cons[b]=1  
 	51	         ...       p.addconstraint(cons,max=1)  
 	52	         sage: p.solve(objective_only=True) 
 	53	         4.0
```
The line

```
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1) 
```
requires GLPK and some other patches. But it should be written like this:

```
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1)  # optional
```
to flag it as requiring an optional package. Any other tests that require the functionalities of an optional spkg must be flagged as such. When testing these, one would do something along this line:

```
./sage -t -long -optional /path/to/script.py
```

Hmmm... There's something I do not understand here ^^;

At first I thought I had made a mistake by not uploading the last version of my patch, in which I added the required "optional" flags, but in the end it seems there are included already... You can see they are by looking (Ctrl - f) for the word "optional" on the page https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6502/AllMIP-2.patch.gz

I just installed this patch on a brand new install without GLPK, it compiled fine and there were no warnings during the test ( without the -optional flag, obiously)

Could you please check that you downloaded the last version and did not apply a cached file ??

Just to be sure, I upload a flattened version of patch named AllMIP-2-flattened.patch
