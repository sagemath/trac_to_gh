Compiles and installs successfully on Sage 4.0.1 on Ubuntu x86.

The methods in MIP should have doctests/docstrings. e.g. I should be able to type

```
sage: MIP.addBound?
```

and see a nice example for how to add a bound.

I agree, this needs docstrings.

Installation of the spkg went fine on a macbook running 10.4.11. The patch seemed to apply okay. sage -testall on 4.1.rc1 passed except for failures in parallel/decorate (DeprecationWarning: os.popen2 is deprecated. ) and interfaces/sage0 (which could not be replicated).

The examples given in the sage-devel email (below) seemed to work okay, though I am not an expert on this stuff.

```
g=graphs.RandomGNP(10,.5)

p=MIP(max=True)

obj={}
for i in g.vertices():
   obj["V"+str(i)]=1
   p.setinteger("V"+str(i))
p.setobj(Constraint(obj,obj=True))
for (a,b,c) in g.edges():
   obj={}
   obj["V"+str(a)]=1
   obj["V"+str(b)]=1
   p.addconstraint(Constraint(obj,lt=1))
p.solve()
```

- solves LP using GLPK ( see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6602 )
- the interface with the COIN solver has been moved to a SPKG whose link will be added here
- Doctstrings have been added
- small modifications everywhere

Patch numerical.mip-2.patch applies on top of 2428.patch

I hope you will like it !! I spent a lot of time on this LP for SAGE ! ;-)

I usually debug by just running sage -t with the file open in an editor until it passes:-) 

Am I to apply MIP1 then MIP2? If so, there was a problem compiling (amd64, ubuntu 9.04):

```
wdj@hera:~/sagefiles/sage-4.1.1.alpha1$ ./sage -b

These patches applies to an amd64 ubuntu 9.04 machine passes sage -testall (except for the already reported errors for sage 4.1.1.a1). 

Things are improving but there are some remaining issues:

1. There is a possible typo in the docstring for MIP:

```
        For example linear function 3 * x - 2 * y + 3 * z
        where x,y, and z are objects is represented as { x : 3, y : -2, z : -3 }
```

might have a sign error and should I think be 

```
        For example linear function 3 * x - 2 * y + 3 * z
        where x,y, and z are objects is represented as { x : 3, y : -2, z : 3 }
```

2. There is no example in the docstring for MIP.solve. There should be at least one 
(fairly simple and well-commented) and preferably more. Please check other 
docstrings for missing examples. They are *required* as part of the code 
inclusion process. Please read:
http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#documentation-strings

I do !!

It means first that I sent another patch without testing it in the end again ( for which I am sorry ), and also that I forgot some of the algorithms in the solvers were randomized, which explains for some results being different from time to time. I "corrected" this by picking examples for which the solutions are unique ;-)

Patch MIP-4 available ;-)

MIP-5.patch is available !

Two lines' worth of modifications to print different messages when wrong solvers are selected.. And I don't think I will have anything to add to that for the moment ;-)

And as soon as this patch is accepted into Sage, I post the new graph functions ;-)

Thank you so much again !!!

They will use sage -i <spkg-name>, not sage -upgrade, on the bash command line.
Also, install_package('<spkg-name>') should work from the Sage command line or 
the notebook.

Of course, anyone can use 
sage -i http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg
to install glpk right now (or
sage -f http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg
to force a reinstall).

Once Minh or William posts a comment to this trac ticket saying "applied to sage x.y.z" and "status => closed" (or something like that) then it will be part of the next release of Sage. Until then, yes, a user should create a new clone and then apply your patches using hg_sage.

Hi Nathann. The timing of these patches is unfortunate :-(  I'm about to release Sage 4.1.1 in a couple of hours. The release has been delayed far too long.

New patch AllMIP-2 available.

All the calls to solve() are flagged optional. *This class should now compile even without the libraries glpk* ( which have been removed from module_list ) : all is left in this class except the call to solveGlpk, which is now a function defined in the new version of the spkg ( see #6817 ).

It is a bit better this way, as this was already the case with package CBC ( now, the code is "symmetric" between Glpk and Cbc, as both are optional packages )

In the end :
* To test this code aply patch AllMIP-2
* To install the new version of Glpk which is to make this code useful, type 

```
sage -f http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/glpk-4.38.spkg

This spkg being currently reviewed at #6817 ( it should be pretty quick, there is nothing new in this patch except a function which had already been reviewed here ! )

That is fine by me. But note that since the patch `AllMIP-2.patch` depends on an optional package, its doctests should be marked with "# optional" so that running doctests with something like "./sage -t -long  /path/to/script.py" would skip over doctests that require optional spkg's. At the moment, most of the doctests in `AllMIP-2.patch` require that the optional package GLPK be installed, but those doctests that require this package are not flagged with "# optional". See for example, this doctest:

```
 	39	         sage: ### Computation of a maximum stable set in Petersen's graph ### 
 	40	         sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph() 
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1) 
 	42	         sage: obj={} 
 	43	         sage: for i in g.vertices(): 
 	44	         ...       obj[i]=1  
 	45	         ...       p.setinteger(i)  
 	46	         sage: p.setobj(obj) 
 	47	         sage: for (a,b,c) in g.edges(): 
 	48	         ...       cons={}  
 	49	         ...       cons[a]=1  
 	50	         ...       cons[b]=1  
 	51	         ...       p.addconstraint(cons,max=1)  
 	52	         sage: p.solve(objective_only=True) 
 	53	         4.0
```
The line

```
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1) 
```
requires GLPK and some other patches. But it should be written like this:

```
 	41	         sage: p=MIP(sense=1)  # optional
```
to flag it as requiring an optional package. Any other tests that require the functionalities of an optional spkg must be flagged as such. When testing these, one would do something along this line:

```
./sage -t -long -optional /path/to/script.py
```

Hmmm... There's something I do not understand here ^^;

At first I thought I had made a mistake by not uploading the last version of my patch, in which I added the required "optional" flags, but in the end it seems there are included already... You can see they are by looking (Ctrl - f) for the word "optional" on the page http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/6502/AllMIP-2.patch

I just installed this patch on a brand new install without GLPK, it compiled fine and there were no warnings during the test ( without the -optional flag, obiously)

Could you please check that you downloaded the last version and did not apply a cached file ??

Just to be sure, I upload a flattened version of patch named AllMIP-2-flattened.patch
