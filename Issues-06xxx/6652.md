I designed the original Aldor domain `DataStream` as a container being an equivalent of an infinite array. Since the Stream can contain any objects, it makes no sense for the stream to provide a `__mul__` and `__add__` method. Any algebraic operations should be defined in a derived class.

Suggestion: Remove `__add__`, `__mul__`, `_times_naive`, `stretch` and `_stretch_gen` from stream.py and put them into a more appropriate place in the class hierarchy.

<a id='comment:5'>Comment 5:</a>
The deleted code is completely redundant with some code in `generating_series.py`. 
It is never used, and the design says that it must go in generating series. Therefore, 
I agree with Ralf that it should be deleted !

Positive review.
