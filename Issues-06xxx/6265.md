As discussed at #6051.  Line 91 of sage/rings/polynomial/toy_d_basis.py needs to be unrandomed when this is fixed.

```
However, when we compute the Groebner basis of I (defined over `\ZZ`), we note that there is a certain integer in the ideal which is not 1.::

    sage: d_basis(I) # random -- waiting on upstream singular fixes at #6051

Indeed, I also have some doubts. Let us check "needs_info"

The `...` are there to replace *huge* numbers. Maybe we should keep the top few digits ?

I don't know anything about the theory of d-Gröbner bases. However, from the explanation in the doctest, it seems to me that the integers in the binomial generators do not matter (at least not for the test). It seems to me that the point of the example is to show that
- there is an integer in the d_basis, and
- the prime factors of that integer have the property that the original system has solutions modulo that prime.
