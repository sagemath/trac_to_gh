Thanks mainly to Dan Shumow, 4.1.1 has some very useful code for constructing elliptic curve isogenies.  Together with a summer student Jenny Cooley, I am implementing the following:

1. For `l=2,3,5,7,13` over any field, find all `l`-isogenies of a given elliptic curve. (These are the `l` for which `X_0(l)` has genus 0).

2. For the remaining `l` for which `l`-isogenies exist over QQ, similarly.

3. Given an elliptic curve over QQ, find the whole isogeny class (this currently exists by wrapping some eclib code, but that it not very robust -- what we are writing will be!)

4. Testing if two curves are isogenous (at least over QQ;  we can do something over other number fields but I am still working out how to make it rigorous.)

At the moment I am not planning anything over finite fields, where the situation is very different, though the generic code for `l=2,3,5,7,13` will work (as it is right now, only as long as the characteristic is not 2, 3 or `l`, but eventually that will change).

Some of the methods we are implementing were worked out by  Mark Watkins and me in an unfinished preprint c.2005.

As one major test of the code for curves over QQ, we are intending to check that the databases are closed under isogeny (as they should be!  at least my own should be).

Sorry for being so slow in reviewing this. This is a very good and long patch, so I will allow myself a bit more time to look at it. So far I only spotted a few minor issues. 

* Coverage issue which should be easy to fix :

   ```
   ell_curve_isogeny.py
   SCORE ell_curve_isogeny.py: 98% (79 of 80)

   Missing doctests:
         * _isogeny_machine(Ew, f, ker, a, iso=None, E=None):


   Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
         * unfill_isogeny_matrix(M):
  ```

* The patch applies fine and the first few tests I did pass. But when you deleted the top part of the patch you (=John) probably deleted a little bit too much, the presentation here is missing something in the beginning. I don't think that it harms the patch though.

* Naming : Do you want to call it l_isogenies ? I agree that prime_degree_isogenies is a bit long, but would have the advantage of being clear about what l can be and about the possible confusion with 1 and I (depending on the font). Or isogenies_of_prime_degree that would make the function appear in .isog<tab>. 

* In line 1266 of ell_number_field.py, docstring of is_isogenous, you write
    *If ``True``, this test should be followed by a rigorous test (not fully implemented).*
  What do you mean by should ? Do you mean "this test is followed by a rigourous test if it is implemented for the given curve..." ? I think I know what goes on from the second to last example, but maybe it would be good to have a sentence or two about it.

Of course, these are very minor things. once I have played around a little with the code and read a bit more of it, I will give a positive review....

Chris.
