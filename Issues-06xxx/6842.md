The following is incorrect, if I am not mistaken (but I am not a native speaker):

```
sage: n = 113
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'113rd'
sage: n = 112
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'112nd'
sage: n = 111
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'111st'
```

With my patch, one gets

```
sage: n = 111
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'111th'
sage: n = 112
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'112th'
sage: n = 113
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'113th'
```
while one still has

```
sage: n = 121
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'121st'
sage: n = 122
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'122nd'
sage: n = 123
sage: n.ordinal_str()
'123rd'
```
