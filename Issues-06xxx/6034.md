Hi Simon,

why is the last result wrong? It searches in `/home/king/SAGE/devel/sage-4.0/local/share/singular` first, which looks correct to me. What am I missing?

Double sorry. I was missing something. Ithought that ``system("SingularLib")`` gives precisely one location in which Singular is looking for libraries. But, as you point out, it may provide multiple search paths.

OK, then back to Kiran's positive review.

What did you do in order to install the spkg?

You should do:
1. Either replace the singular-3-0-4 spkg by the new spkg and re-build Sage *from scratch*
2. Or do the following:
     i. ``sage -i singular-3-1-0...`` (so, install it into an existing sage)
     iii. ``sage -f ntl...`` (so, force a re-installation of the ntl-spkg)
     iiiii. 
       * Do ``sage -ba``, or 
       * touch all Cython extensions depending on Singular (these are sage.libs.singular.singular, sage.matrix.matrix_mpolynomial_dense, sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular and sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular) and do ``sage -b``

This is how I installed the new spkg.

Cheers,
    Simon

Aren't these dependencies already in `module_list.py`? Actually this is where I was looking what I had to touch. Or perhaps touching `libsingular.h` would have been enough, who knows...
