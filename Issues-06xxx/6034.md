The SPKG can be found here:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-0-2-20090512.spkg

It does not contain the changed LIB location. It basically is a drop-in replacement for the current Singular spkg.

What did you do in order to install the spkg?

You should do:
1. Either replace the singular-3-0-4 spkg by the new spkg and re-build Sage *from scratch*
2. Or do the following:
     i. ``sage -i singular-3-1-0...`` (so, install it into an existing sage)
     iii. ``sage -f ntl...`` (so, force a re-installation of the ntl-spkg)
     iiiii. 
       * Do ``sage -ba``, or 
       * touch all Cython extensions depending on Singular (these are sage.libs.singular.singular, sage.matrix.matrix_mpolynomial_dense, sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular and sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular) and do ``sage -b``

This is how I installed the new spkg.

Cheers,
    Simon
