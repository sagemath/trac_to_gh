**Attachment:** [singular_3_1_0.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6034/singular_3_1_0.patch)

The SPKG can be found here:

   http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/spkgs/singular-3-1-0-2-20090512.spkg

It does not contain the changed LIB location. It basically is a drop-in replacement for the current Singular spkg.

Sorry, but something is wrong.

I get

```
sage: import os
sage: os.environ['SINGULARPATH']
'/home/king/SAGE/devel/sage-4.0/local/share/singular'
sage: singular.eval('system("SingularLib")')
'/home/king/SAGE/devel/sage-4.0/local/share/singular:/home/king/SAGE/devel/sage-4.0/local/LIB'
```

But the last line is Singular's way of telling where the libs are.

Double sorry. I was missing something. Ithought that ``system("SingularLib")`` gives precisely one location in which Singular is looking for libraries. But, as you point out, it may provide multiple search paths.

OK, then back to Kiran's positive review.

We want to merge this in 4.0.2 so quick movement is appreciated.\n\n\nWhat did you do in order to install the spkg?\n\nYou should do:\n1. Either replace the singular-3-0-4 spkg by the new spkg and re-build Sage *from scratch*\n2. Or do the following:\n     i. ``sage -i singular-3-1-0...`` (so, install it into an existing sage)\n     iii. ``sage -f ntl...`` (so, force a re-installation of the ntl-spkg)\n     iiiii. \n       * Do ``sage -ba``, or \n       * touch all Cython extensions depending on Singular (these are sage.libs.singular.singular, sage.matrix.matrix_mpolynomial_dense, sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular and sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular) and do ``sage -b``\n\nThis is how I installed the new spkg.\n\nCheers,\n    Simon",

> This segfaults on startup for me with sage-4.0.1.  I thought the patch at #6051 might help, but it doesn't apply against 4.0.1.  We want to merge this in 4.0.2 so quick movement is appreciated.


What did you do in order to install the spkg?

You should do:
1. Either replace the singular-3-0-4 spkg by the new spkg and re-build Sage *from scratch*
2. Or do the following:
     i. ``sage -i singular-3-1-0...`` (so, install it into an existing sage)
     iii. ``sage -f ntl...`` (so, force a re-installation of the ntl-spkg)
     iiiii. 
       * Do ``sage -ba``, or 
       * touch all Cython extensions depending on Singular (these are sage.libs.singular.singular, sage.matrix.matrix_mpolynomial_dense, sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_ideal_libsingular and sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular) and do ``sage -b``

This is how I installed the new spkg.

Cheers,
    Simon

Should we add something involving these dependencies to `module_list.py`?

Yes. The right dependencies would be `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/libsingular.h`, strange I thought I did that a while ago.

Aren't these dependencies already in `module_list.py`? Actually this is where I was looking what I had to touch. Or perhaps touching `libsingular.h` would have been enough, who knows...
