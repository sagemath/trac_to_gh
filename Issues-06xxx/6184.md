Just like the title says; the options noted do not have any effect on 3D plots in Sage 4.0.rc0.

For example, the command

```
plot3d(lambda x,y: exp(x+y*I).real(), (-2, 2.4), (-3, 3), mesh=True)
```
Should display a 3D plot with mesh lines drawn in. However, the result does not have mesh lines.

(This bug was discussed at [this forum thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ac3ae56aa896826f).)

I will attach a patch that fixes the issue.

Does anyone know where this functionality was broken, and what the code was like before?

This seems to fix the problem and not cause others in the limited testing I have done.  Since it is a surgical-strike type of patch I feel good about giving it a positive review - this is basically two extra lines that correctly pass on an option.
