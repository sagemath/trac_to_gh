Just like the title says; the options noted do not have any effect on 3D plots in Sage 4.0.rc0.

For example, the command

```
plot3d(lambda x,y: exp(x+y*I).real(), (-2, 2.4), (-3, 3), mesh=True)
```
Should display a 3D plot with mesh lines drawn in. However, the result does not have mesh lines.

(This bug was discussed at [this forum thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ac3ae56aa896826f).)

I will attach a patch that fixes the issue.

This seems to fix the problem and not cause others in the limited testing I have done.  Since it is a surgical-strike type of patch I feel good about giving it a positive review - this is basically two extra lines that correctly pass on an option.
