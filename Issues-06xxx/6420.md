```
sage: integrate(1/x^3,x,1,infinity)
ValueError: Integral is divergent.
```

But it's NOT!

The problem comes from Maxima. I could check four versions:

```
Maxima 5.13.0: it's ok
Maxima 5.16.3: it gives wrong result, Sage 4.0.2 uses this
Maxima 5.17.1: it gives wrong result
Maxima 5.18.1: it's ok
```

An example for wrong result:

```
petya@desktop:~/download/sage/sage-4.0.2-linux-Ubuntu_9.04-i686-Linux/local/bin$ ./maxima
Maxima 5.16.3 http://maxima.sourceforge.net
Using Lisp ECL 9.4.1
Distributed under the GNU Public License. See the file COPYING.
Dedicated to the memory of William Schelter.
The function bug_report() provides bug reporting information.
(%i1) integrate(1/x^3,x,1,inf);

Integral is divergent
 -- an error.  To debug this try debugmode(true);
```

We would like to teach undergradute students with Sage, and this bug is quite annoying. It would be helpful, if someone could update Maxima in Sage.


 Thanks,
  Peter

A temporary workaround is to use sympy:

```
sage: integrate(1/x**3,x,1,infinity,algorithm="sympy")
1/2
sage: integrate(1/x**10,x,1,infinity,algorithm="sympy")
1/9
```

I updated the patch to remove some excess blank lines and to remove the ".. note::" which didn't make sense.  Otherwise, your change is good by me.

kcrisman, could you okay these changes and mark it as a positive review?
