1.4.3

* Released: 21 Nov, 2008
* Code Maturity: Stable
* Source Archive: http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html#lib...
* Licenses: GPLv3
* Interfaces: Command Line

The file SPKG.txt says:

See also https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/1627
When I download libcrypt-1.4.4 from http://www.gnupg.org/download/index.en.html#libgcrypt
the COPYING file indicates GPLv2 and the COPYING.LIB file indicates LGPLv2.1.

I don't see 1.4.3 there.

I guess we should go by the COPYING file. The website and the actual code disagree. I assume the code is more authorative. 

I suspect this should be closed in that case.

I think the file COPYING in the source tarball is the authority here. So close this ticket as invalid.
