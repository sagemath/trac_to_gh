From: adavid (on sage-devel)

```
After building 4.0rc0 overnight, on my laptop, I started make test
the next morning. . I shutdown the laptop before completion as I had
to rush out the door (suspend would have been a good idea...).

Regardless, I ended up with a temporary file structure with a number
of
spawned_processes files consisting of NULLs which triggers the bug as
detailed below.

Why is there NULLs instead of numeric string? <--rhetorical question

$SAGE_BASE/sage-main/sage/interfaces/cleaner.py writes the PID

Async I/O means the PID may or may not be written on a shutdown/power
outage etc.

Patch:
(against 4.0rc0)

Notes:


- Linux carbonate 2.6.18-4-686 #1 SMP Mon Mar 26 17:17:36 UTC 2007
i686 GNU/Linux
- Debian GNU/Linux 5.0

- tested patch with a shutdown during a make test, 82 spawned-
processes files created.
Successful sage-cleaner invocation on sage  startup.

- no tests yet on other OSes/arches etc

-  The sage-cleaner statement i=L.find(' ') in kill_spawned_jobs fails
to find any spaces

- could fix the above problem but it is better to attack the root
cause,
hence the patch to cleaner.py and not sage-cleaner

- patch could be improved by creating a temporary file and them
performing
a rename after the close.

- The debug print statements in sage-cleaner were uncommented to
assist with
defining the problem

- Don't have access to TRAC

- This is not a specific 4.0rc0 bug

Multiple tests of patch showed that null file was still created on occasions during shutdown.
Was unable to reproduce NULL-populated spawned-processes files by running test
and interrupting it with a power outage.
Conclusion: Supplied patch needs more work. Will try using all os level I/O functions
and introduce temp/rename approach.

I used 

```
sage -merge 6128 -t long -n 12
```

to try testing this on sage.math (debian 64-bit), and almost immediately got errors:

I also tried applying the patch manually.

I then keep seeing 

```
  File "/scratch/wstein/build/sage-4.0.2/local/bin/sage-cleaner", line 75, in kill_spawned_jobs
    os.killpg(int(pid), 9)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
```

which was the error that started this whole ticket... and which is an error I have never seen before today.

I then patched sage-cleaner so that it just deletes files that contain this empty pid and Sage works for me again.

I did try applying this patch again, but got lots of errors about

```
        o.fflush()
    AttributeError: 'file' object has no attribute 'fflush'
```

Anyway, in short, this patch doesn't work at all for me.  Maybe fflush works on some platforms but evidently not 64-bit debian linux.

I'm seeing a similar error in a freshly-built vanilla 4.2 on Ubuntu Jaunty: the build finished without errors, and when I start Sage, I get:

```

This seems to be slightly different than the reported bug, but I'm seeing the same errors that William did above, which is quite strange.
