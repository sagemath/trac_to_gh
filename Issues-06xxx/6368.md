Right now, in the notebook, usually shift-tab goes back to the previous input cell.  Since tab goes forward 4 spaces (or if text is highlighted, indents it), and shift-tab unindents highlighted text, it would by far make the most sense if shift-tab when no text is highlighted just goes back 4 spaces.

Nice work!

* This works as expected in Cr4, FF3.5.7, & S4 on Windows XP and Cr4 & FF3.5.6 on Linux.
* In O10 on XP and Linux, shift-tab for non-empty selections was already broken and is still broken.
* In IE8 on XP, auto-indentation and tab/shift-tab were already broken and they still are.
