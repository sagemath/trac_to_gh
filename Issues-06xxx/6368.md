Right now, in the notebook, usually shift-tab goes back to the previous input cell.  Since tab goes forward 4 spaces (or if text is highlighted, indents it), and shift-tab unindents highlighted text, it would by far make the most sense if shift-tab when no text is highlighted just goes back 4 spaces.

Nice work!

* This works as expected in Cr4, FF3.5.7, & S4 on Windows XP and Cr4 & FF3.5.6 on Linux.

We can make new tickets for the latter two.  It seems that a given browser behaves more consistently across platforms than different browsers on a given platform, but it would be great to get feedback on various browsers on Mac OS.  Usually, we test what we can, e.g., the locally available combinations, ourselves and receive more varied data from the field (alphas, rcs, and releases).
