Right now, in the notebook, usually shift-tab goes back to the previous input cell.  Since tab goes forward 4 spaces (or if text is highlighted, indents it), and shift-tab unindents highlighted text, it would by far make the most sense if shift-tab when no text is highlighted just goes back 4 spaces.

Nice work!

We can make new tickets for the latter two.
