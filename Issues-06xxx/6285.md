(1) Description for "arcsin" wrongly says it is "The inverse of the hyperbolic sine function" !!

```
arcsin?

File:        /home/golam/foo/sage-4.0.1/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/sage/functions/trig.py
Type:        <class 'sage.functions.trig.Function_arcsin'>
Definition:  arcsin(x, hold='False')
Docstring: 

        The inverse of the hyperbolic sine function.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: arcsinh(0.5)
            0.481211825059603
            sage: arcsinh(1/2)
            arcsinh(1/2)
            sage: arcsinh(1 + 1.0*I)

```

(2) Is it also missing " ginac='acos' " in conversion dict?

Both "arccos" and "arctan" have that conversion defined.


Keywords: **arcsin, wrong description**
