Here is an example of how to convert back/forth to numpy to solve A*x
= b very quickly.  Below we do this with A a 1000x1000 matrix, and it
takes about a half second.   It would be *great* if somebody made it
so this would work in Sage automatically without having to explicitly
use numpy like I've done before.  But for you, I bet this is a minor
inconvenience.

sage: n = 1000
sage: a = random_matrix(CDF,n); v = random_matrix(CDF,n,1)
sage: aa = a.numpy(); vv = v.numpy()
sage: import numpy
sage: time ww = numpy.linalg.solve(aa, vv)
Time: CPU 0.57 s, Wall: 0.41 s
sage: w = matrix(CDF, ww)
sage: max([abs(z) for z in a*w - v])

This already works.  The problem is that it is backwardly-named solve_left.  The solve_right function incurs the overhead of a matrix copy (but then solves the backwards equation, since solve_left is backwards).

To fix all this:

1. Rename the matrix_double_dense.pyx solve_left to solve_right
2. implement a matrix_double_dense.pyx solve_left that takes the transpose and then calls solve_right


Eventually, we also need to fix the lu solve.  There is another trac ticket for this somewhere.  The problem is that the function does not deal correctly with the output of the scipy lu decomposition.
