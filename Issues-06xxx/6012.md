With this patch, you can use pdflatex instead of latex, in two different ways: use a %pdflatex cell in the notebook, or call

```
latex.pdflatex(True)
```
after which any use of latex (in a %latex cell or using the `view` command) will use pdflatex.

This way, if you have the most recent version of pgf installed, as well as the tkz-graph package, you can get pictures like those at [http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html](http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html) in your notebook.  (I think that tkz-graph might require using pdflatex instead of latex.  In any case, I could successfully get the graph in a %pdflatex cell -- see graph.png -- but not in a %latex cell.)

`%latex` seems to fail on the use of `dvipng`.  When I run dvipng outside of Sage on a dvi file having graphs in it, I get boatloads of warnings:

`dvipng warning: PostScript environment contains DVI commands`

the failures seem to occur when dvipng calls Ghostscript - I see errors from Ghostscript when I run dvipng outside of Sage, and if I use `%latex_debug` in the notebook, the last output is a Ghostscript error message.

Outside of Sage, I can take source with tkz-graph code, run (plain)latex, then convert the dvi to Postscript with dvips, then convert to PNG with imagemagick's convert.  I get full pages with numbers, and the resolution looks a bit crummy, but I presume that can be fixed with options.  

(1)  Is it reasonable to expect  dvipng  to process these dvi files right?  Should we (me) contact the tkz-graph author to inquire?

(2)  Is it worth the trouble to go  latex->dvi->ps->png  for a `%latex` cell, or just be content with `%pdflatex` working properly?

This is very nice.  To be able to go get a pretty PNG of a graph in the notebook with just a few lines of code will be fantastic.  I'll be working on a review.

This isn't because of this patch, is it?  I can't get these graphs to appear using a %latex cell with or without the patch -- I can only use %pdflatex with the patch.

Adds a "pdflatex" chain, so `%pdflatex` in notebook cells will produce PNG's using pdflatex, or at the command-line `view()` will produce a PDF and call a PDF viewer.  This functionality allows the tkz-graph package to work, once the package is included in the latex preamble.

Exposes some problems with the dvipng utility on some dvi files, which could be routed through this new pdflatex chain as an alternative.
