With this patch, you can use pdflatex instead of latex, in two different ways: use a %pdflatex cell in the notebook, or call

```
latex.pdflatex(True)
```
after which any use of latex (in a %latex cell or using the `view` command) will use pdflatex.

This way, if you have the most recent version of pgf installed, as well as the tkz-graph package, you can get pictures like those at [http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html](http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html) in your notebook.  (I think that tkz-graph might require using pdflatex instead of latex.  In any case, I could successfully get the graph in a %pdflatex cell -- see graph.png -- but not in a %latex cell.)

`%latex` seems to fail on the use of `dvipng`.  When I run dvipng outside of Sage on a dvi file having graphs in it, I get boatloads of warnings:

`dvipng warning: PostScript environment contains DVI commands`

the failures seem to occur when dvipng calls Ghostscript - I see errors from Ghostscript when I run dvipng outside of Sage, and if I use `%latex_debug` in the notebook, the last output is a Ghostscript error message.

Outside of Sage, I can take source with tkz-graph code, run (plain)latex, then convert the dvi to Postscript with dvips, then convert to PNG with imagemagick's convert.  I get full pages with numbers, and the resolution looks a bit crummy, but I presume that can be fixed with options.  

(1)  Is it reasonable to expect  dvipng  to process these dvi files right?  Should we (me) contact the tkz-graph author to inquire?

(2)  Is it worth the trouble to go  latex->dvi->ps->png  for a `%latex` cell, or just be content with `%pdflatex` working properly?

This is very nice.  To be able to go get a pretty PNG of a graph in the notebook with just a few lines of code will be fantastic.  I'll be working on a review.

This isn't because of this patch, is it?  I can't get these graphs to appear using a %latex cell with or without the patch -- I can only use %pdflatex with the patch.
