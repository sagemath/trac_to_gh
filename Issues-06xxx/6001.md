As mentioned in [this message](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/msg/d021522accd00e81), it might be useful to tear/pop/pull/rip out/off/up at least some notebook introspection window(s) into a separate window(s) [1].

This ticket, which builds on #5653 (see comments [comment:ticket:5653:19 19ff]), is currently a ~~disaster~~ test area for variations on this theme.

Related: #4714, #5644, #5447, #5653, #6307.

[1] Nevertheless, they're all fine docstrings.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">Comment 6</div>

I've tested the new, possibly improved [`introspect.js`](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6001/introspect_v2.js.gz) on Fedora 9 Linux in Firefox 3.0.10, Opera 9.64, and a Qt 4.5.0 WebKit-based "browser" demo.

I'm not sure about how well the latter, which I found in `/usr/lib64/qt4/demos/browser,` approximates Safari.  It returns

```
"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux; en-US) AppleWebKit/527+ (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari/419.3)  demobrowser/0.1"
```
when I enter `navigator.userAgent` in the JavaScript console (check the "Tools" menu or right-click on any element, then click on "Inspect").  To get "tab" introspection working, I just added `'sl':keyboard_saf` near the end of `keyboards.py.`  Perhaps this is related to ticket #4046.

Anyway, it seems all the browsers have their own way of doing just about everything, and no major UI library handles pop-ups seamlessly across browsers.  We may not (cannot?) get identical behavior on all major browsers.

Some possible tests, besides the obvious:

* Check whether multiple tear-outs from a worksheet go to a common window.
* Ditto, from multiple worksheets.
* Ditto, after reloading a worksheet(s).
* Ditto, after navigating to another domain (e.g., `google.com`) in a tear-out window(s) (see [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy)).
* Check the behavior when tear-outs go to an *unsized* window and the browser is set to open tabs vs. set to open windows.
* Ditto for *sized* windows.

For the latter, see the `window.open()` lines in `introspect.js.`  In Firefox, I still get a blank tab when I force new windows to open in tabs and use unsized pop-ups.  I have got this to work with a somewhat different approach, but I haven't yet reconciled it with what's in v2.

Drag-and-drop sometimes behaves oddly in Firefox, adding copious spurious placeholders to the list.  I've noticed this after I navigate to a different domain in a tear-out window, forcing the script to open a new window.  I think this is a jQuery [UI] bug, since it goes away when I substitute the latest versions.  This and other quirks may be a good reason to upgrade both.  Worst case: Disable some tear-out features for certain browsers.

Some ideas, though my patience with browser "programming" has all but vanished:

* Do something server-side instead or in addition.
* Add a top-level toolbar to the tear-out window, e.g., to toggle, close, resize all docstrings.
* Add a simple "cell" input that calls `window.opener.evaluate_cell_inspection().`
* Cookies, preferably chocolate.

Some ideas related to #5653:

* Collect anonymous statistics on docstring access: compute correlations, do Bayesian predictions, rank the greatest (and worst) docstring writers of ***all time***.
* Generate a large graph of all docstrings and their cross-links.  Drive the graph theorists wild.  Actually, I think it's rather sparse at the moment.  Not an [expander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expander_graph)?
* Upgrade Sphinx and test the Qt help builder, though it may [need work](http://groups.google.com/group/sphinx-dev/browse_thread/thread/64dd226d9b4cec36/6fa3e0d251dae768#6fa3e0d251dae768).  Try running Qt's `assistant` (`assistant-qt4` on Fedora 9) for a taste.
* Add "PDF" to the toolbar, with maybe a rude surprise for PDF plug-in users.
* One-click copy-pasting of examples for the truly lazy.
