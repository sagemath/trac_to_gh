in singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0/spkg-install, it should say:

                --disable-NTL \

instead of:

                --with-NTL \

otherwise, things can get messed as libsingular.so will have the
same NTL symbols as libtnl.so. What can be very problematic, if
something also links with the libntl.a generated by the singular
package.

This appears to be the root of some of the problems in my
sagemath rpm packages, where some doctests would fail due to
libc aborting, and to make things worse, if running the doctest
only in the offending file, it would not crash, *or* if LD_PRELOAD'ing libntl.so.

This bug is not really relevant, because singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0.spkg removes the ntl directory (as noticed in spkg-changes). I reported the problem after checking symbols in libsingular.so of a sage 4.1 install. But, by using the suggested patch, it is not required to remove the ntl directory.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

I just tracked and corrected most, if not all, crashes in the new
Mandriva sagemath-4.7 rpm package by rebuilding singular but before
that, rm -rf'ing the ntl subdirectory.

Interestingly I had noticed the issue long long ago, and forgot
about it, but the problem is that if not removing the ntl
subdirectory, it will still build the local ntl and/or link
statically to it, even when told to use the system ntl, with
something like --with-ntl=/usr

I had this issue because I did use pristine upstream tarball
for the singular package, and not make it based on the sage
spkg tarball.

So if this is not (or no longer) a Sage issue, can we close this ticket?

Or did I miss something?
