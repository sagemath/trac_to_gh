This cythonfies Eisenstein series and uses FLINT instead of NTL to speed up Victor Miller basis by factor 2 and Eisenstein series even more.

Old

```

New

```
sage: %timeit eisenstein_series_qexp(18, 1000)
100 loops, best of 3: 4.17 ms per loop
sage: %timeit victor_miller_basis(18, 1000)

sage: %timeit victor_miller_basis(18, 100000)
10 loops, best of 3: 4.29 s per loop
```

This also has some effect on echelon basis of modular forms.

Old

```
sage: %time h = ModularForms(1, 18).echelon_basis()[0].qexp(10000)
CPU times: user 5.00 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 5.12 s
Wall time: 5.13 s
```

New

```
sage: %time h = ModularForms(1, 18).echelon_basis()[0].qexp(10000)
CPU times: user 4.70 s, sys: 0.09 s, total: 4.79 s
Wall time: 4.80 s

This is good code, but a little more work is needed:

- It is **unacceptable** that the function delta_qexp now has no docstring at all -- this must be changed.

- The docstring of delta_poly refers to options from delta_qexp that are not actually accepted by delta_poly, and also the return type it describes is clearly wrong.

- The following comment doesn't seem to match the actual code:

```
# then use NTL to compute the remaining fourth power
f = Fmpz_poly(v)
```

See also #6020, where the NTL/FLINT speed issue was discussed extensively (although without any clear conclusion, since NTL seems to win on some platforms and FLINT on others)

I added the docstrings and modified them, such that there is a reference to the credits for William and Craig. Besides I modified the code slightly, such that it uses the new code in flint.fmpz_poly (same functionality there; This was a patch also provided by me).

Please, consider this : Due to formating issues, that I don't understand, I had to reformat many doctests for victor_miller_basis(...).

It would have been wise to try and understand what was happening here, rather than just casually changing all the doctests to match whatever results your code happened to produce.\n\n\n- Docstrings. Docstrings! They are important! Many of your docstrings bear only very scanty resemblance to the actual code, e.g. the docstring for eisenstein_series_poly claims it returns a list whereas in fact it's returning a Fmpz_poly object. Furthermore, the normalisation it uses is not either of the standard ones (i.e. neither the constant nor linear coeffs are 1) so you should document what it is actually doing, and add a doctest to prove it. On a similar note, in the \"authors\" section for the top-level Victor Miller basis function you've put \"Martin Raum (2009-08-02) : Use FLINT, eisenstein_series_list and delta_list\" -- this presumably refers to some previous versions of the functions you've since deleted. \n\n- (Relatively minor quibble): The docstring of `eisenstein_series_poly` doesn't appear in the reference manual, while that of `eisenstein_series_qexp` does, so I think the explanatory note about the algorithm should go in the latter, although the logic it documents is in the former. On a related note, the function `delta_poly` is for internal use only, so it would probably be better to rename it as `_delta_poly` to keep it from appearing in the reference manual.\n\n\n- Before: \n\n```\nsage: time f = eisenstein_series_qexp(300, prec=300)\nCPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.08 s\nWall time: 0.08 s\nsage: f[17]\n80209810833685322547441216640793046418531912652780577247188195636352386970411639577599796091104012101130717894701055491951622698591353123624261645540716464351344232869435068758174405683700539108020074191942626567981338004282490220912228333614228282202627549912059318605175057042490646040306263891324441973189409859729207141378843824365061425627861617456672310716754354\n```\nAfter:\n\n```\nsage: f = eisenstein_series_qexp(300, prec=300)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)\n\n/home/david/sage-4.3.5/devel/sage-vmiller/sage/modular/modform/<ipython console> in <module>()\n\n/home/david/sage-4.3.5/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/modform/eis_series.pyc in eisenstein_series_qexp(k, prec, K, var)\n     76     R = PowerSeriesRing(K, var)\n     77     if K is QQ :\n---> 78         return a0fac*R(eisenstein_series_poly(k, prec).list(), prec=prec, check=False)\n     79     else:\n     80         # this is a temporary fix due to a change in the\n\n/home/david/sage-4.3.5/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/modform/eis_series_cython.so in sage.modular.modform.eis_series_cython.eisenstein_series_poly (sage/modular/modform/eis_series_cython.c:3931)()\n     12\n     13\n---> 14 cpdef eisenstein_series_poly(int k, int prec = 10) :\n     15     r\"\"\"\n     16     Return the q-expansion up to precision 'prec' of the\n\n/home/david/sage-4.3.5/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/modform/eis_series_cython.so in sage.modular.modform.eis_series_cython.eisenstein_series_poly (sage/modular/modform/eis_series_cython.c:3490)()\n     62     expt = <unsigned long int>(k - 1)\n     63     a0 = - bernoulli(k) / (2*k)\n---> 64     a0den = a0.denominator()\n     65     #if a0 < 0 : a0den = -a0den\n     66\n\nOverflowError: value too large to convert to int\n```\n\nFrankly I think we've now got to the point where it'll be quicker for me to fix the above myself rather than go through a fourth iteration.

Attachment: **[trac-6671-3-victor-miller.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6671/trac-6671-3-victor-miller.patch.gz)**

Sorry, this still isn't up to scratch.

- The "formatting issues that you don't understand" are because the old code always returns a Sequence object which prints each entry on a new line, while your new code inconsistently sometimes returns a Sequence and sometimes a list. It would have been wise to try and understand what was happening here, rather than just casually changing all the doctests to match whatever results your code happened to produce.


- Docstrings. Docstrings! They are important! Many of your docstrings bear only very scanty resemblance to the actual code, e.g. the docstring for eisenstein_series_poly claims it returns a list whereas in fact it's returning a Fmpz_poly object. Furthermore, the normalisation it uses is not either of the standard ones (i.e. neither the constant nor linear coeffs are 1) so you should document what it is actually doing, and add a doctest to prove it. On a similar note, in the "authors" section for the top-level Victor Miller basis function you've put "Martin Raum (2009-08-02) : Use FLINT, eisenstein_series_list and delta_list" -- this presumably refers to some previous versions of the functions you've since deleted. 

- (Relatively minor quibble): The docstring of `eisenstein_series_poly` doesn't appear in the reference manual, while that of `eisenstein_series_qexp` does, so I think the explanatory note about the algorithm should go in the latter, although the logic it documents is in the former. On a related note, the function `delta_poly` is for internal use only, so it would probably be better to rename it as `_delta_poly` to keep it from appearing in the reference manual.


- Before: 

```

```
After:

```
sage: f = eisenstein_series_qexp(300, prec=300)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frankly I think we've now got to the point where it'll be quicker for me to fix the above myself rather than go through a fourth iteration. I'll upload a second patch that fixes the above issues, later today or possibly tomorrow.

Hi Craig,

Well, Alex is going to be waiting on me for this code fairly soon, which means it's going to get done fairly soon. That said, it seems like it can't hurt to merge Martin's code first -- it means I'll essentially do a second review when I merge my code, and if there are any clever tricks Martin spotted that I missed, they won't get lost.

You're right -- there's no real loss to using FLINT (and it means my code will get yet faster, in fact). I knew it was something that shouldn't matter "in principle," but I hadn't sat down and actually worked out the details to find out that it's fine in practice, too. I suspect that you'll still get into a little bit of trouble if you're trying to allocate a q-expansion that's the same order of magnitude as the amount of memory in your machine, but if that's what you're up to, you need specialized code no matter what. 

In regards to #6020 -- the only real pending issue on that ticket was the fact that 32-bit OSX was lagging; since we only compile in 64-bit on OSX these days, we could probably just merge that fix as-is, if Martin's code doesn't completely subsume it.

I looked up whether the Victor-Miller basis normally referes only to cusp forms, but it doesn't seem so (http://www.sagemath.org/doc/bordeaux_2008/level_one_forms.html). I changed this in one doctest.
It is not neccessary to introduce res2 and this will safe half the memory.

I integrated these two minor changes into your patch.

Regarding #6020: This chould be a follow up patch and I will see if I find the time to merge Craig's code with the new patch tomorrow. My code does not subsume it.
