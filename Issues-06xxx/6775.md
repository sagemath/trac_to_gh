I would like to have an easy to use disjoint-set data structure like the one described here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_set_data_structure

```
sage: d = DisjointSet(range(5))
sage: d
{{0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}}
sage: d.union(3,4)
sage: d
{{0}, {1}, {2}, {3, 4}}
sage: d.union(0,2)
sage: d
{{0, 2}, {1}, {3, 4}}
sage: d.union(1,4)
sage: d.find(3)
3
sage: d.find(4)
3
```

As suggested [by Robert Miller on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/4b6d5bb2983d81c2/f52adb855eb3b09f?lnk=gst&q=disjoint+set#f52adb855eb3b09f), one could use what is defined in

`sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_*`

I just added a patch. I have two issues :

1. I still have some problems with pikling :

```
slabbe@slabbe-laptop:~/sage-4.1/devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-09                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: combinat
sage: d = DisjointSet(5)
sage: b = loads(dumps(d))
sage: b


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

2. I am using the `__del__` function to call the `OP_dealloc`, but I not sure it is proper...

1. You should probably declare things like

```
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(SageObject):
    cdef OrbitPartition *_nodes 
```
and

```
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashable(SageObject):
   cdef list _int_to_el
   cdef dict _el_to_int
   cdef DisjointSet_of_integers _d
```
in `disjoint_set.pxd` instead of `disjoint_set.pyx`. That'll make it easier to use these classes elsewhere.

2. You should have `__del__` print something and see if it's even getting called. I would define `__dealloc__` and see if that gets called instead. You're using `OP_dealloc` correctly.

Done. Thanks for the comment. But is it really necessary since the function `DisjointSet` is the function used as a constructor? Should I also add that one to the `.pxd` ?

Yes, because your dealloc isn't doing anything. You should replace `pass` with `OP_dealloc(self._nodes)`.

The patch trac_6775-with_dealloc-sl.patch puts back the dealloc. I now get a mysterious error :

```
slabbe@pol:~/sage-4.2/devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets$ sage -t disjoint_set.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx"   
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
	 [2.3 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx"
Total time for all tests: 2.3 seconds
```

Today I was not able to reproduce the same problem in the command line. Is there a way to get more informations on such a failed test?

Although, adding a print statement in the `__init__` gives more information in the failed tests. I am getting the result below. Changing the print statement from one `__init__` to another changes the place where the memory error occur.

```

```

Will I get the same problem at the same place if I redo all the doctests in the same order as in the file by hand directly in the command line. Can I reproduce the problem is my actual question.

I think I also need to understand when exactly the `__dealloc__` is called.

The docbuild problem comes from `_sage_getargspec_cython` which fails because it doesn't handle the presence of commas inside default value of arguments of a function. In fact, both `OP_represent` and `PS_represent` do use commas in their default arguments... 

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getargspec_cython
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython('def PS_represent(partition=5, splits=[444]):')
(['partition', 'splits'], None, None, (5, [444]))
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython('def PS_represent(partition=5, splits=[444,4]):') 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Could not parse cython argspec
```

One solution could be to avoid the presence of those two functions in the doc, but I don't know how to do this since they appear from the cython line

```
include '../groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi'
```
which includes everything in the file including `PS_represent` and `OP_represent` which are not needed for `disjoint_set.pyx`. Is it possible to include only what we need?

I think this problem concerns something independant from this ticket (another ticket could be open for the comma problem). So I change the status of this ticket to `needs review`.

Are you still having the same problems building the documentation?

If you are, then you should know that both `OP_` and `PS_` -`represent` are functions which are only intended to illustrate a point. In fact, you could change their default arguments to `None` and simply feed in the original arguments in the doctests, since that is their only purpose.
