I would like to have an easy to use disjoint-set data structure like the one described here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_set_data_structure

```
sage: d = DisjointSet(range(5))
sage: d
{{0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}}
sage: d.union(3,4)
sage: d
{{0}, {1}, {2}, {3, 4}}
sage: d.union(0,2)
sage: d
{{0, 2}, {1}, {3, 4}}
sage: d.union(1,4)
sage: d.find(3)
3
sage: d.find(4)
3
```

As suggested [by Robert Miller on sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/4b6d5bb2983d81c2/f52adb855eb3b09f?lnk=gst&q=disjoint+set#f52adb855eb3b09f), one could use what is defined in

I just added a patch. I have two issues :

1. I still have some problems with pikling :

```
slabbe@slabbe-laptop:~/sage-4.1/devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets$ sage
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading Sage library. Current Mercurial branch is: combinat
sage: d = DisjointSet(5)
sage: b = loads(dumps(d))
sage: b
| Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-09                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).
------------------------------------------------------------
```

2. I am using the `__del__` function to call the `OP_dealloc`, but I not sure it is proper...

1. You should probably declare things like

```
cdef class DisjointSet_of_integers(SageObject):
    cdef OrbitPartition *_nodes 
```
and

```
cdef class DisjointSet_of_hashable(SageObject):
   cdef list _int_to_el
   cdef dict _el_to_int
   cdef DisjointSet_of_integers _d
```
in `disjoint_set.pxd` instead of `disjoint_set.pyx`. That'll make it easier to use these classes elsewhere.

2. You should have `__del__` print something and see if it's even getting called. I would define `__dealloc__` and see if that gets called instead. You're using `OP_dealloc` correctly.

Done. Thanks for the comment. But is it really necessary since the function `DisjointSet` is the function used as a constructor? Should I also add that one to the `.pxd` ?

The function `__del__` was not called, but `__dealloc__` is. Although, I am getting memory errors when using the `__dealloc__` function. I put a `pass` command in it and I get All test pass. Am I losing memory somewhere?

Needs review!

Yes, because your dealloc isn't doing anything. You should replace `pass` with `OP_dealloc(self._nodes)`.

The patch trac_6775-with_dealloc-sl.patch puts back the dealloc. I now get a mysterious error :

```
slabbe@pol:~/sage-4.2/devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets$ sage -t disjoint_set.pyx
sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx"   
A mysterious error (perhaps a memory error?) occurred, which may have crashed doctest.
	 [2.3 s]
exit code: 768
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


	sage -t  "devel/sage-combinat/sage/sets/disjoint_set.pyx"
Total time for all tests: 2.3 seconds
```

Today I was not able to reproduce the same problem in the command line. Is there a way to get more informations on such a failed test?

Although, adding a print statement in the `__init__` gives more information in the failed tests. I am getting the result below. Changing the print statement from one `__init__` to another changes the place where the memory error occur.

```

------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component

```

Will I get the same problem at the same place if I redo all the doctests in the same order as in the file by hand directly in the command line. Can I reproduce the problem is my actual question.

I think I also need to understand when exactly the `__dealloc__` is called.

You may need to build a fresh version of Sage to use valgrind with it, see the above link for details. Once you get it built, and get your patch attached, you can run the doctest session in valgrind mode, and when it segfaults, valgrind will tell you what leaked.

Finally, `sage -t -verbose` gave me enough information to solve the problem. There was one doctest doing :

```
sage: DisjointSet(-1)
```

to illustrate that the argument must be non negative. The test `arg < 0` was done inside the `__init__` function of the class so that the attribute `_nodes` was not initialized if an error was raised before. Then, `__dealloc__` was trying to call `OP_dealloc` on a non existing `_nodes` : BOOM!

I moved the `arg < 0` test in the `DisjointSet` function and All tests passed : great !

I just uploaded the second patch.

The docbuild problem comes from `_sage_getargspec_cython` which fails because it doesn't handle the presence of commas inside default value of arguments of a function. In fact, both `OP_represent` and `PS_represent` do use commas in their default arguments... 

```
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import _sage_getargspec_cython
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython('def PS_represent(partition=5, splits=[444]):')
(['partition', 'splits'], None, None, (5, [444]))
sage: _sage_getargspec_cython('def PS_represent(partition=5, splits=[444,4]):') 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Could not parse cython argspec
```

One solution could be to avoid the presence of those two functions in the doc, but I don't know how to do this since they appear from the cython line

```
include '../groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_pyx.pxi'
```
which includes everything in the file including `PS_represent` and `OP_represent` which are not needed for `disjoint_set.pyx`. Is it possible to include only what we need?

I think this problem concerns something independant from this ticket (another ticket could be open for the comma problem). So I change the status of this ticket to `needs review`.

Are you still having the same problems building the documentation?

If you are, then you should know that both `OP_` and `PS_` -`represent` are functions which are only intended to illustrate a point. In fact, you could change their default arguments to `None` and simply feed in the original arguments in the doctests, since that is their only purpose.
