Using the tkz-graph package in latex allows for a variety of customizations in the output.  So methods will allow a graph to set and carry options that can be used by the latex() method.

1.  make set_latex_option(), get_latex_option(), clear_latex_option()  as new methods for a graph

2.  Add a dictionary to a graph that contains the values of these options.

3.  So the latex() method can query the dictionary and act accordingly.

See #5975

No, this is not obsolete and this is not how we do things around here ;).

Comment on the other ticket that it also fixes this ticket. Then both of them will be closed and credited when the other ticket has been merged.
