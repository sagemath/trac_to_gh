```
Here are two independent Sage 4.1 sessions which demonstrate that the
construction of NumberField's is context dependent:

       sage: K.<x> = CyclotomicField(5)[]
       sage: W.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
       sage: W
       Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1 over its base field

       sage: W1 = NumberField(x^2+1,'a')
       sage: K.<x> = CyclotomicField(5)[]
       sage: W.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 1)
       sage: W
       Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 1

In fact:

       sage: W1 is W0
       True
```
