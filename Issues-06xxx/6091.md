At present

```
sage: C.<z> = CyclotomicField(20)
sage: D.<w>, phi = C.subfield(z^4)
```
fails.

This is simply because the code uses the name `name` instead of the name `names`.  The patch fixes this, and does the same for `change_generator` (with doctests).

This will break all old code that uses the name= syntax.

There is a decorator at sage.plot.misc.rename_keyword that could be use to rename a 'name' keyword argument to 'names'.  A useful thing to do would be to add a flag to that decorator so that a deprecation warning would be thrown whenever a rename is done.

Point taken.

I think in this case there's a simpler solution,  already used in the `NumberField`function, which allows either `name` or `names`; see the replacement patch.
