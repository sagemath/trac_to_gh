CBC is a Free ( though not GPL-compatible ) Linear Program and Mixed Integer Program Solver from the COIN-OR suite.

Even though it is not Free and will have to remain an optional package, COIN-OR has performances way above GLPK which is to be used by default in SAGE ( see http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6502 and http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9da47e06bcdfc49f )

This SPKG contains the last version of CBC and a Cython class to make it available through numerical.mip when installed.

The SPKG can be found at this address :
http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/cbc-2.3.spkg

I hope you will like it ! ;-)

It seems you had some problems in #6502 applying the patch I posted, and I thought it may be because I was working on an old version of SAGE. If you are available to review #6502 I would be glad to install a new one and create a new patch for this version, containing all the stuff related to the class mip.

As soon as it will be compiled, you will have the new patch ! ;-)
