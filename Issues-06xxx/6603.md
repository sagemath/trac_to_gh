CBC is a Free ( though not GPL-compatible ) Linear Program and Mixed Integer Program Solver from the COIN-OR suite.

Even though it is not Free and will have to remain an optional package, COIN-OR has performances way above GLPK which is to be used by default in SAGE ( see https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6502 and http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9da47e06bcdfc49f )

This SPKG contains the last version of CBC and a Cython class to make it available through numerical.mip when installed.

The SPKG can be found at this address :
http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/cbc-2.3.spkg

I hope you will like it ! ;-)

explaining the problem and send the relevant part of
of /home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/install.log.  Describe your computer, operating system, etc.
If you want to try to fix the problem, yourself *don't* just cd to
/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/spkg/build/cbc-2.3 and type 'make'.
Instead type "/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/sage -sh"
in order to set all environment variables correctly, then cd to
/home/wdj/sagefiles/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/spkg/build/cbc-2.3
(When you are done debugging, you can type "exit" to leave the
subshell.)
```

Any idea what the problem is?

Regarding the problems in #6502, the last thing you said was "I suggest we wait until 4.1.1 is out." 

We are now at 4.1.1.rc0. Would you like more checking done on this ticket? On #6502? Wait for 4.1.1.final to 
retest both?

The only thing that can be checked on this SPKG for the moment is the installation process. Most of the tests will occur during the reviewing of #6502 .

It seems you had some problems in #6502 applying the patch I posted, and I thought it may be because I was working on an old version of SAGE. If you are available to review #6502 I would be glad to install a new one and create a new patch for this version, containing all the stuff related to the class mip. It will take some time though, as I have to compile SAGE ( there is no binary version for my distribution ). Do you know how I could download the sources Sage 4.1.1.rc0 ?

As soon as it will be compiled, you will have the new patch ! ;-)

Thank you !

This spkg just install all the Cbc-related librarires with a regular /configure && make && make install, then installs the class sage.numerical.mipCoin with a setup.py script ( which, if I make no mistake, creates no file except in the build/directory.

In the end, I'd say this package does not touch a hair of any pre-existing file in Sage ! ;-)
