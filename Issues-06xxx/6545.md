`MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis()` should return the same sorted list as `MPolynomialIdeal.groebner_basis()` when called on an ideal which has a (not reduced) Groebner basis as set of generator. Also the input to `MPolynomialIdeal.triangular_decomposition()` must be sorted to avoid confusing Singular.

This is ticket #5958, isn't it?

Attachment [trac_6545-rebased.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6545/trac_6545-rebased.patch) by mvngu created at 2009-09-09 06:04:43

The patch `trac_6545-rebased.patch` is a rebase of `trac_6545_mpolynomial_ideal_sorted_outputs.patch` against Sage 4.1.2.alpha1. The rebased patch is the same as the previous patch, but without this hunk:
