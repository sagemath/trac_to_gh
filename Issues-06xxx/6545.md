`MPolynomialIdeal.interreduced_basis()` should return the same sorted list as `MPolynomialIdeal.groebner_basis()` when called on an ideal which has a (not reduced) Groebner basis as set of generator. Also the input to `MPolynomialIdeal.triangular_decomposition()` must be sorted to avoid confusing Singular.

This seems to be working, with one exception. When I run it, I get one error:

    TypeError: factor() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proof'

This is ticket #5958, isn't it?

The patch `trac_6545-rebased.patch` is a rebase of `trac_6545_mpolynomial_ideal_sorted_outputs.patch` against Sage 4.1.2.alpha1. The rebased patch is the same as the previous patch, but without this hunk:
