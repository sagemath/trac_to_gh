Right now, we can iterate over word morphisms with specific image lengths :

```
    Iterator over morphisms with specific image lengths::

sage: map(str, W.iter_morphisms([2, 1]))
['WordMorphism: a->aa, b->a',
 'WordMorphism: a->aa, b->b',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->a',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->b',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->a',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->b',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->a',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->b']
sage: map(str, W.iter_morphisms([2, 2]))
['WordMorphism: a->aa, b->aa',
 'WordMorphism: a->aa, b->ab',
 'WordMorphism: a->aa, b->ba',
 'WordMorphism: a->aa, b->bb',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->aa',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->ab',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->ba',
 'WordMorphism: a->ab, b->bb',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->aa',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->ab',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->ba',
 'WordMorphism: a->ba, b->bb',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->aa',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->ab',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->ba',
 'WordMorphism: a->bb, b->bb']
sage: map(str, W.iter_morphisms([0, 0]))
['WordMorphism: a->, b->']
sage: map(str, W.iter_morphisms([0, 1]))
['WordMorphism: a->, b->a', 'WordMorphism: a->, b->b']
```

I want to iterate over all (non erasing) morphisms! In particular, I want the following to work :

```
    sage: W = Words('ab')                 
    sage: it = W.iter_morphisms()
    sage: for _ in range(10): print it.next()
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->a, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->b, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->aa, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->aa, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->ab, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->ab, b->b
    WordMorphism: a->ba, b->a
    WordMorphism: a->ba, b->b
```
