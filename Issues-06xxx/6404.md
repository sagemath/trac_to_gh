```
In current Sage (4.0.2), while typesetting conjugate() of
an symbolic expression, latex symbol "\bar" is used

```
sage: latex(x.conjugate())
\bar{x}
```

The problem with "\bar" is that it is of fixed width and not scalable. For example, this is inadequate for symbolic functions

```
sage: x,y=var('x,y')
sage: f = function('psi',x,y)
sage: latex(f.conjugate())
\bar{\psi\left(x, y\right)
```

A better solution is to use "\overline" instead of "\bar".

Looks OK to me.

Note: I am giving partial positive review because I tested this patch against my stable sage-4.1. So if it applies cleanly on Sage-4.1.1.rc1 then that would be full positive from me.
