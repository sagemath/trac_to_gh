So what is the order of merging patches here? Is it
1. merge the patches at #6318;
2. then merge the spkg on this ticket in the optional spkg repository?
In that case, #6318 must get positive review first. On the other hand, is this ticket and its spkg not at all dependent on #6318?

I think it is independent of #6318 in the sense that it updates the fricas optional spkg.

And than it fixes the fricas.py failures mentioned in #6318, Not the axiom issues.

In previous versions there was an install option for the lisp flavour but according to the fricas mailing list, this is depreciated and fricas is supposed to detect which lisp is used. I have not yet tested with 4.1.1.alpha0 but it worked for me on 4.0 and 4.1.

Could someone comment on the relation between the two pairs of issues:
- this one, #6318

Is the package here built on the one at #4461? Are the changes on #4036 independent of the ones at #6318?

Thanks.

#4036 are independent of #6318. (I am not sure what they do.)
#6318 fix some interface issues but perhaps should be added after #4036?

As a guess: 1. apply #4036 to a new version (and rebase), 2. apply #6318 and test, 3. check/make a new fricas spkg.

The patches at #4036 are already in and I only added a few fricas tests. I would apply #6318 first, then #4036 (trac_4036-axiom_interface.patch only) and of course axiom and fricas need to be installed to test everything.

I've created an spkg builder at http://boxen.math.washington.edu:29792 .
This code is not an spkg itself but rather builds two spkg: fricas-VERSION.spkg and fricasaldor-VERSION.spkg. It requires a checkout of the FriCAS sources from SVN at sourceforge.

On sage.math the following should work.

WARNING, before you start compiling FriCAS, you should read the top of the Makefile, in particular the part connected to an X server. It's unwise to have the X server running on a different machine from where you compile the spkg!!! The X server is not needed for actually installing the .spkg into Sage.

Get the FriCAS sources:

```
svn export https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas/trunk fricas-sources
```

Use the installed Aldor from my HOME (or install aldor from http://www.aldor.org).

```
export ALDORROOT=/home/hemmecke/aldorroot
export PATH=$ALDORROOT/bin:$PATH
```

Make sure you have ecl 9.8.4.

```
export PATH=$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SAGE_ROOT/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
hg clone http://boxen.math.washington.edu:29792 fricas-aldor-spkg
cd fricas-aldor-spkg
make
```

Installing FriCAS inside Sage

```
cp fricas-aldor-spkg/spkg/fricas*.spkg  $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional
sage -i fricasaldor-VERSION
```

The VERSION of the spkg will automatically be extracted from FriCAS configure script.
VERSION is appropriate if you use a proper release version, i.e. (should work for a release > 1.0.7)

```
svn export https://fricas.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fricas/releases/1.0.8 fricas-sources
```
and running the fricas-aldor-spkg/Makefile will produce VERSION=1.0.8.

Hi,

I tried on sage.math and on my own machine. When doing 

```
make spadhelp
make noweb
```

I get messages like: 

```
grep: /home/awebb/configure.ac: No such file or directory
grep: /home/awebb/configure.ac: No such file or directory
```

So it seems to be looking in the wrong place. I then get the following when I try to make.

```
sage subshell$ make FRICAS_SRC=../fricas-sources
mkdir -p build
touch -t 199901010000 build/.dir

noweb-2.10a.tgz is in the zips directory. Is the script looking in the fricas-sources instead?

Hi,

I apologize if I misunderstood. My impression was that work was ongoing and packages would be made available when ready.

When I tried making the packages on sage.math I eventually get to the following. 

```

I will try again on a local machine although my machine is much slower.

Yes, that was the plan, and I volunteer to be the maintainer of the spkg-builder.
The fricasaldor stuff is just a question of time.

If it works, someone should upload it to http://sagemath.org/packages/optional/ .
What is the workflow to get the package into the "optional" archive?

The error message says it all. And http://boxen.math.washington.edu:29792/file/25ab4f31480e/SPKG.txt.fricas#l1 also lists ecl as a dependency.

If there were a proper package management in Sage, I would have made ecl a formal dependency, but adding "sage -i ecl-9.8.4" to the install script is also not fool proof, since specifying a version number is bad. Giving no version number is bad as well. I'd rather wish to be able to specify a range of versions that should work for the fricas-1.0.8.
Try

Thanks for the packages. I guess it is mentioned somewhere that installing fricasaldor depends on the source of fricas. This means that the following is needed:

```
sage -i -s fricas-1.0.9.spkg
sage -i fricasaldor-1.0.9.spkg
```
I had a problem with an example for fricasaldor. 

```
(1) -> )co fib.as
   Compiling FriCAS source code from file /home/math/test/fib.as using
      AXIOM-XL compiler and options
-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-ALDOR_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra -I $AXIOM/algebra
      Use the system command )set compiler args to change these
      options.
   Compiling Lisp source code from file fib.lsp
   Issuing )library command for fib
   Reading /home/math/test/fib.asy
(1) -> fib 5

   >> System error:
   Error when using UNREAD-CHAR on stream #<string-input stream from "3(1) ->
```

where fib.as is

```
#include "axiom"
fib(n: Integer): Integer == {
        n < 0 => 0;
	n < 3 => 1;
	fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```

I get get this with ecl but not with sbcl but I think this is a known problem. Another example with a simple factorial function worked. I did some simple things and the fricas package seemed to work fine.

That is **not** so! As explained [above](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6517#comment:17), the commands are simply:

```
cp fricas-aldor-spkg/spkg/fricas*.spkg  $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/optional
sage -i fricasaldor-X.Y.Z
```

Dependency is included in the package fricasaldor.

Yes that seems to be an ecl problem and I have no idea how to track that. So unfortunately, I cannot fix it. I think the link to Aldor is not as stable as it should be.

The whole problem is due to the Aldor Public License 2. :-( That's the only reason why there are two packages.

> > Dependency is included in the package fricasaldor.

 
> I got the following when installing fricasaldor. The message says that the build directory is missing so I assumed that I had made a mistake. 

Yes. The whole problem is due to the Aldor Public License 2. :-( That's the only reason why there are two packages. The fricas spkg is mBSD and the fricasaldor spkg is APL2.
The other problem is that Sage does not provide a proper mechanism to deal with dependencies. (People should look at "zc.buildout".)

It's all not so easy since currently fricasaldor needs the build directory of the build of the fricas package. It basically copies copies some files into this directory and then starts the build.

So saying

```
sage -i fricas-X.Y.Z
sage -i fricasaldor-X.Y.Z
```
will not work, because the build directory of fricas is gone. I guess that might be the problem with your error.

The other thing is
> 
> ```
> ****************************************************
> Installing -s fricas-1.0.9
> Calling sage-spkg on fricas-1.0.9
> Warning: Attempted to overwrite SAGE_ROOT environment variable
> ```

Do you have an idea who is printing that warning?

Exactly, 

```
sage -i -s fricas-X.Y.Z
sage -i fricasaldor-X.Y.Z
```

This worked for me since the -s keeps the build directory in the first step.

I think I see it everytime I use sage -i to install something. I assume that it is part of the Sage installing process somewhere. I don't know why the SAGE_ROOT would need to be changed though.
