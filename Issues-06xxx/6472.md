This is wrong:

```
sage: R.<a,b,c,d>=PolynomialRing(QQ,order="lex")
sage: ideal(a-b^16,b-c^16,c-d^1024).groebner_basis()
[a - d^4096, b - d^16384, c - d^1024]
```

The correct answer as given by Macaulay 2:

```
i30 : R=QQ[a,b,c,d, MonomialOrder=>Lex];
i31 : I=ideal(a-b^16,b-c^16,c-d^1024);
i32 : gens gb I
o32 = | c-d1024 b-d16384 a-d262144 |
```

In particular the binomial involving a should raise d to the power 262144=2<sup>18</sup>, not 4096=2<sup>12</sup> as Sage reports.

I suspect that the reason is that by default Sage uses Singular to implement groebner_basis, and Singular has limitations on the size of exponents. See https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_455.htm which in particular says

```
the maximal allowed exponent of a ring variable depends on the ordering of the ring
and is at least 32767.
```
(I suppose "least" is a typo, should be "most"...)
