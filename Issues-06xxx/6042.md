This is just sickening.  I must have spent over 10 hours in the last week documenting this file, resulting in a patch over 2000 lines long, and 100% doctest coverage.  But now I cannot apply it since after the 7 patches on 3 tickets which David warned me about (#5736, #4357 and #5250 all already merged in 4.0alpha0, in that order) I get this mess:

```

I'm really not sure I can be bothered to mess with this any more.  Is there any system to actually help one merge conflicting patches sensibly?  I have never managed to get things like k3diff to work.

I will at least upload my patch  so that it does not get lost, but I have other things to do.

Hi John,

I feel your pain.  I don't know of an automated system to get this done properly.  But I'll try to rebase it to 4.0alpha0, and review it in the process.  Hopefully I can do this in the next 36 hours or so.

Hehe, I will fix this once I import the patch.

The rebased patch on top of two other trivial tickets in my 4.0.rc0 merge tree:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  75.0%
Total number of functions:  22100
We need    6 more function to get to 75% coverage.
```

:))

Cheers,

Michael
