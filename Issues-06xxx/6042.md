This is just sickening.  I must have spent over 10 hours in the last week documenting this file, resulting in a patch over 2000 lines long, and 100% doctest coverage.  But now I cannot apply it since after the 7 patches on 3 tickets which David warned me about (#5736, #4357 and #5250 all already merged in 4.0alpha0, in that order) I get this mess:

```

I'm really not sure I can be bothered to mess with this any more.  Is there any system to actually help one merge conflicting patches sensibly?  I have never managed to get things like k3diff to work.

I will at least upload my patch  so that it does not get lost, but I have other things to do.

Hi John,

I feel your pain.  I don't know of an automated system to get this done properly.  But I'll try to rebase it to 4.0alpha0, and review it in the process.  Hopefully I can do this in the next 36 hours or so.

Hehe, I will fix this once I import the patch. 

David: Before posting the patch you can just edit the credit in the hg header at the top of the file.

The rebased patch on top of two other trivial tickets in my 4.0.rc0 merge tree:

```
Overall weighted coverage score:  75.0%
Total number of functions:  22100
We need    6 more function to get to 75% coverage.
```
