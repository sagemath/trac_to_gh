The important one is the last, which doesn't apply because the local `twist.py` contains

But I could have altered my configuration.

Replying to [jason](#comment%3A6):

I believe the `sage -bdist` and `sage -sdist` invoke [distutils](http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute) to build `sage-*.spkg`.  Distutils uses `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/MANIFEST.in` to determine which files to include in the distribution.  If we add files to the local Mercurial repository, we should check that some line(s) in `MANIFEST.in` includes the newly tracked files or add a new line.

Previous sightings: #4460, #5653, #5799, #6568, etc.

Changes in patch v3:

* `css.py`: `if os.path.exists(user_css):` --> `if os.path.exists(user_css_path):`
* `css.py`: `+` --> `os.path.join()`
* `css.py`: html -> HTML in docstring
* `main.css`: {% ->  {%-

Sorry about the trivial stuff.  I just noticed the [whitespace control](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates#whitespace-control) part of the Jinja2 docs.

This is a positive review from me, but someone should review my changes.
