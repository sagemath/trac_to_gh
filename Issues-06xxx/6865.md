The important one is the last, which doesn't apply because the local `twist.py` contains

```python

            return HTMLResponse(stream = message("Your account is currently suspended."))

But I could have altered my configuration.

Changes in patch v3:

* `css.py`: `if os.path.exists(user_css):` --> `if os.path.exists(user_css_path):`
* `css.py`: `+` --> `os.path.join()`
* `css.py`: html -> HTML in docstring
* `main.css`: {% ->  {%-

Sorry about the trivial stuff.  I just noticed the [whitespace control](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates#whitespace-control) part of the Jinja2 docs.

This is a positive review from me, but someone should review my changes.
