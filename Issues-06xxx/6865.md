CSS is currently served by `css()` in `css.py`, even though it is completely static. Using templates for it should make things easier to customize in the future.

The important one is the last, which doesn't apply because the local `twist.py` contains

But I could have altered my configuration.

Replying to [@jasongrout](#comment%3A6):
> What is MANIFEST.in and when do we need to add things to it?

I believe the `sage -bdist` and `sage -sdist` invoke [distutils](http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute) to build `sage-*.spkg`.  Distutils uses `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/MANIFEST.in` to determine which files to include in the distribution.  If we add files to the local Mercurial repository, we should check that some line(s) in `MANIFEST.in` includes the newly tracked files or add a new line.  Otherwise, the next (pre-)release of Sage will not include them.  As mvngu puts it, this results in ["repository corruption"](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/697693c77e8d7ee8/290f2ec5412b909d?q=repository+corruption+group:sage-devel#290f2ec5412b909d).

Previous sightings: #4460, #5653, #5799, #6568, etc.

Changes in patch v3:

* `css.py`: `if os.path.exists(user_css):` --> `if os.path.exists(user_css_path):`
* `css.py`: `+` --> `os.path.join()`
* `css.py`: html -> HTML in docstring
* `main.css`: {% ->  {%-

Sorry about the trivial stuff.  I just noticed the [whitespace control](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates#whitespace-control) part of the Jinja2 docs.

This is a positive review from me, but someone should review my changes.
