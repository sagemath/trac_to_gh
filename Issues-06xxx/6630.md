I'm writing a patch which create the empty species. Before the patch I didn't find any way to create it...
It is the species which contains no structure at all and as such does not seems very useful. However, it is the zero of the semi-ring of the species and may be needed when you do computation on species, for example to give the default value for the function sum()...

And this is yet another patch from me about empty objects :)

The following private methods have doctests, but no docstrings:
 
1. `__init__()`
2. `_gs()`
3. `_structures()`

This lack of docstring would come back to haunt the documentation writer and user because when #6586 is merged then private methods would show up in the reference manual. So two things remain to be done:

1. Someone needs to review the patch `trac_6630-reviewer.patch`.
2. Add docstrings to the above private methods. One easy way to do so is to first apply `empty_species-fh-6630.patch`, followed by `trac_6630-reviewer.patch`. Then write docstrings based upon those two patches and upload another patch. I'm marking this ticket as "needs work".

<a id='comment:7'></a>Dear Franco and Minh,

I just uploaded the hopefully final version of the patch with full doctests coverage. I reviewed positively mvngu's patch and folded into mine. Please rereview.

Note: There are two slight change in the code:
- I corrected the output of the species (I never tried to print an empty species).
- The internal function _structure should never be called. I let it raise an error rather than pass and update the doc accordingly.

Note: for the release manager: use only `empty_species-fh-6630-v2.patch`.

Cheers,

Florent
