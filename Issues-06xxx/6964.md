Implement this function q_eigenform_character described below:

```
sage: f = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(13),2,sign=1).cuspidal_subspace().decomposition()[0]
sage: f.q_eigenform(5,'a')
q + a*q^2 + (-2*a - 4)*q^3 + (-a - 1)*q^4 + O(q^5)
sage: f.q_eigenform_character('a')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'ModularSymbolsSubspace' object has no attribute 'q_eigenform_character'
```

In case f.character() is not None, the above function should be easy to implement -- just return the character.  Otherwise it is harder.
