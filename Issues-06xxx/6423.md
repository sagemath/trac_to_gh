Vladimir Bondarenko (a developer of software to test computer algebra systems - see [http://www.cas-testing.org/](http://www.cas-testing.org/) ), had been playing with [http://demo.sagenb.org/](http://demo.sagenb.org/) and noted the following:

```
exp(-x^i).integral(x,0,1)  returns

Traceback (click to the left for traceback)
...
Is %i an integer?

Ouch! Any Sage comments?
```

When I reported his on sage-devel, William Stein said:

''A large amount of the symbolic functionality that uses Maxima has
issues like this, but unfortunately there is basically nothing we can do about it, except continue with projects to rewrite the parts of Sage that call Maxima so that they don't call Maxima.  So this class of bugs should be very good motivation to continue to work on
implementing symbolic integration ourselves (and/or further improving sympy!).''

He then went on to say he wanted it reported as a TRAC bug but was busy, so I have done it on his behalf. 

I don't feel able to comment much more on this, and personally don't intend trying to fix it (outside my knowledge), so I've just reported it. 

Can someone else add appropriate priority, milestones, keywords etc, as this is completely outside my *comfort zone*.

Unfortunately, it seems not.  From uw.sagenb.org:

```
sage: exp(-x^i).integral(x,0,1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints (try the command 'assume(i>0)' before integral or limit evaluation, for example):

sage: maxima.eval('integrate(exp(-x^%i),x,0,1);')
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: Computation failed since Maxima requested additional constraints (try the command 'assume(i>0)' before integral or limit evaluation, for example):
Is %i an integer?
```

This also was verified on a local installation.

Of course, now we'll have to deal with nounforms and gamma_incomplete translation, but hopefully that won't be too big of a hurdle.

Using Maxima 5.20.1 with Sage 4.3.alpha1:

```
sage: exp(-x*i).integral(x,0,1)
I*e^(-I) - I
```
So if that is mathematically correct, sounds like it's fixed.  The following link [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+e%5E%28-x*I%29+from+0+to+1](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=integrate+e%5E%28-x*I%29+from+0+to+1) indicates it is, as well as just using the FTC.  Now we just need the spkg and to put a doctest here.

See #7748 for getting a symbolic incomplete gamma, which we would also need regardless of that.

Positive review! Tested on 4.3.rc0 and got only errors which have been reported on sage-devel and are not relevent to this ticket. Tested together with #7745 and #4142.

Positive review, thanks for upgrading.
