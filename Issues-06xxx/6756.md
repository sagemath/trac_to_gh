Implement a diff format symbolic derivative in new symbolics as the second form of abstract derivative to be avialable in Sage. See this long thread

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/ff10f99729a74eea/73308bf626ae06b3

for rationale behind it.

**Implementation:**

Instructions for installing these patches (sage-4.1.1)

**(1) Pynac patch**   
 (a) Get the pynac spkg

 http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/burcin/pynac/pynac-0.1.8.p2.spkg

 (b) Apply the pynac patch implementing diff derivative from

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/diff-derivative-pynac.patch

 (c) install the patched spkg in Sage.

 **OR** if you are feeling lazy, you can directly install my patched copy of pynac from here

 http://www.math.unb.ca/~ghossain/pynac-0.1.8.p2-with-diff.spkg



**(2) Sage patch:**

 Apply the attached patch in Sage and build the changes ("sage -b").
 If everything goes smoothly then you are ready for testing.

**Testing:**

Above, patches will provide two new user accessible functions
 (a) ``set_diff_derivative_level``

 (b) ``symbolic_diff``

Please see the docs for usage of these functions:

It would be good to thoroughly test the following features:

 (1) Substitution of the function

 (2) Derivative with or without chain rule

 (3) Explicit evaluation of derivative even for some situation where chain rule has been applied and derivative is specified w.r.t. an expression

 (4) Symbolic n-th derivative

 (5) Typesetting 

Please test diff implementation against some related bugs

#6376, #6523, #6480

as new diff implementation should avoid these.


**Speed Test:**

```
sage: f(x) = function('f',x);
sage: f(x).diff(x)
D[0](f)(x)
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 124 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x,100)')
125 loops, best of 3: 5.58 ms per loop

sage: set_diff_derivative_level(1)
sage: f(x).diff(x)
diff(f(x), x, 1)
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 116 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x,100)')
625 loops, best of 3: 1.01 ms per loop

sage: set_diff_derivative_level(2)
sage: f(x).diff(x)
diff(f(x), x, 1)
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x)')
625 loops, best of 3: 130 µs per loop
sage: timeit('f(x).diff(x,100)')
125 loops, best of 3: 1.85 ms per loop
```


***** This patch removes old "dummy_diff" from 
"calculus/calculus" as we now have a _real_ diff.

I am interested in reviewing this, but I'm not sure that I can at this time.  I have a heavily modified `Sage Version 4.1.rc1, Release Date: 2009-07-07` tree that I can't really upgrade right now.  I have applied this patch and installed your modified spkg.  I am getting the following doctest failures

Thanks Nick for trying it out. From this error, it seems "diff_derivative_level" flag wasn't set to
value greater than "0". It could be that "set_diff_derivative_level()" failed to set it properly.

This looks really weired to me. Does it work before calling "set_diff_derivative_level()"?


I can suggest you to check three things

  (1) Ensure in "symbolic/pynac.pyx" you have a line:

```
      "cdef public int diff_derivative_level = 0"
```
   May be you can set it to "1", to enable "diff" by default.


  (2) In "symbolic/all.py" you have a line:

```
     "from derivative import symbolic_diff"
```
  (3) In "calculus/calculus.py" the following line is commented out or removed

```
      "syms['diff'] = dummy_diff"
```
If these three lines are fine then it should work. Some doctests may it still
fail if "set_diff_derivative_level()" isn't working properly but you can
always change value in (1) manually without using it.

Please let me know if that works.

Best,

Nick, if you give examples of how you want pattern matching on derivatives to work, we can see how to make the current implementation support these. Pattern matching capabilities of `fderivative` in GiNaC definitely need to be improved. Looking at what functionality maple and MMA provides could also help.

Following are my comments:

  (1) f(y,y) is not a genuine function of two variables. So asking for its chain rule, pretending it to be a function of multiple variables, is itself incorrect assertion.

  (2) I don't think even D[] derivative output is much better in this regard, specially if you implement and allow substitution of f(y,y). For example. consider the substitution: f(y,y) = y in "D[0](f)(y, y) + D[1](f)(y, y)", then you will get the same wrong answer from D[] as from "diff".
      
  (3) Applying chain rule is just an option in new diff implementation and certainly not the default option. However, this could be useful sometime (for example in computing Euler-Lagrange equation using functional derivative of a formal functional "S(f(y), g(y))" this feature is needed. In fact, this was the reason for implementing this feature.)

So I am sorry to differ from your opinion about removing this feature.

As I posted in the sage-devel, I initially implemented this within Sage as SFunction 
sub-class (as you suggest). Then I re-implemented this in c++ as pynac native implementation 
because this is 10-15 times faster than the Sage implementation.


Why do you want to have a slower implementation of diff than a faster one?

I agree that we need this conversion at least to restore compatibility of D[] with Maxima which is badly broken now because of D[] derivative. However, I don't agree that I should implement this conversion and certainly not as a pre-requirement for accepting this patch.   

Given above arguments, I am reverting back to "needs review" status.

This substitution doesn't make sense mathematically. D[0](f)(y,y) doesn't contain f(y,y), there is nothing to substitute.

Bill Page had answered this point earlier:

This message by him in the same thread might be more helpful:

Note that with these patches, the result of `f(y,y).diff(y)` is twice that of the current implementation.

Hmm, if you bring mathematical sense into argument then does it
make mathematical sense asking for applying chain rule at the
first place for this case?

> Note that with these patches, the result of `f(y,y).diff(y)` is twice that of the current implementation.


This is not accurate. 

Above will happen only when an user wants to apply chain rule by explicitly setting 
diff_derivative_level to "2" or more and certainly NOT in default diff level of "1". 
If some user wants to use some setting that are not default then its reasonable to
expect users to read the documentation to be aware of the assumptions associated with
the settings.

So you agree that setting this level to 2 gives wrong results. In comment:10, I tried to say that this option that gives wrong results should be removed.

We can then merge this *inert* derivative with the global `diff` command by adding a keyword option `hold`. E.g.,

```
sage: f(y,y).diff(y,1)
D[0](f)(y, y) + D[1](f)(y, y)
sage: f(y,y).diff(y,1,hold=True)
diff(f(y, y), y, 1)
```

Sure. However, it would be premature to merge this with global "diff" now, given its a 
new implementation and there could be issue which are not yet known. So I would prefer

What do you think is "mathematically dubious"?

Using the notation and definitions for derivatives and partial derivatives from here respectively:

http://books.google.at/books?id=e54cqeAmf4QC&pg=PA267#v=onepage

http://books.google.at/books?id=e54cqeAmf4QC&pg=PA495#v=onepage

Let U be an open subset of the complex numbers, f: UxU -> C, y in U. Then by Proposition 3.5 here

http://books.google.at/books?id=LzhkCF9ZsUgC&&pg=PA10#v=onepage

we have

\frac{df}{dy} (y,y) = D_1 f(y, y) + D_2 f(y, y).

Note that on the left hand side there is a *total* derivative.

In the current Sage syntax, "diff" denotes a total derivative, and "D" denotes a partial derivative. The statement above translates to the Sage notation as:

diff(f(y,y), y) = D[0](f)(y,y) + D[1](f)(y,y)

Which you can also calculate by:

```
sage: diff(f(y,y),y)
D[0](f)(y, y) + D[1](f)(y, y)
```

---

With your patch we get:

```
sage: set_diff_derivative_level(2)
sage: diff(f(y,y),y)
2*diff(f(y, y), y, 1)
sage: latex(diff(f(y,y),y))
2 \, {\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f\left(y, y\right)}
```

Can you explain what `diff(f(y,y), y, 1)` or in typeset form `\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y,y)` means?

Should it really be merged into Sage if it's so premature? The point of the review to make sure that it doesn't have these problems.

I don't have any more time to waste on this. I suggest you either 
* read the references I linked to in comment:10, and explain clearly what you do to remedy the problems discussed there or,
* remove the problematic parts from your patch.
