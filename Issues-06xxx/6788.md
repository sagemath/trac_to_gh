This still fails for me, but what is worrying is how the CPU usage keeps climbing after the test failure. 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f5502f8489cc2b31

This is nothing to do with this particular test, but this test is an example of which shows that doctest failures are handled badly.

Hi, 
sorry for not replying earlier, but I did not see the request. The .spkg for Maxima 5.20.1 does fix this:
