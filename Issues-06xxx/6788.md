This still fails for me, but what is worrying is how the CPU usage keeps climbing after the test failure. 

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/f5502f8489cc2b31

This is nothing to do with this particular test, but this test is an example of which shows that doctest failures are handled badly.
