*** this ticket is still using the old workflow, just apply patches and ignore the "branch" field ***

An implementation of Mestre's algorithm for reconstructing genus 2 hyperelliptic curves from their invariants.

This is limited to fields of characteristic not 2, 3, 5 and to curves with automorphism group generated by the hyperelliptic involution. Curve equations are not reduced, hence are unusably large over QQ, but see below.

That's it. Various other tickets deal with extensions:

* #14755 reduces the discriminant of the hyperelliptic curve (essential for getting usable models over number fields)
* #14756 reduces the hyperelliptic curve equation once the discriminant is minimal (also essential for getting usable models over number fields).
* #12199 treats the case of larger automorphism groups
* #12200 is about characteristic 2, 3, 5

Apply:
* [attachment:6341.patch]

Here's a work in progress version.  The extcode patch

* updates Denis Simon's pari qfsolve program;
* and incorporates Paul van Wamelen's pari genus 2 package.

The main devel patch integrates everything, or at least starts to.

I wrapped lines and clarified / corrected documentation and corrected some formulas. I also removed functions that were not needed.

To do:

- continue with wrapping lines and checking documentation for spelling or formatting problems
- add the missing examples and possibly some more with non-trivial reduction properties
- remove functions marked with "to_remove"
- make sure stoll-cremona reduction is correctly implemented when homogenized to higher degree than the degree of the polynomial
- add a sanity check at the end of HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants, checking if the curve has the correct invariants before outputting it (RuntimeError otherwise)
