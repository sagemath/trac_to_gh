It would be nice to have things like hue() and rainbow() be in their own submodule of plot, and there are a few things in complex_plot regarding coloring that need to be fixed.

**Attachment:** [colors.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6269/colors.patch.gz)

This patch does several closely related things:

1. Takes all coloring functions from plot.plot, plot.misc, and plot.tachyon and puts them in new file plot.colors
2. Writes most of these in Cython, for anywhere between a 3 and 10 times speedup.  This is not so crucial, given that most are called only once or some number of times less than 100 in a given plot, but is still nice.
3. Changes complex_plot.pyx in two ways:
   a. Makes the coloring conform with documentation, in that roygbiv goes from positive real axis counterclockwise (increasing argument) instead of the other way around
   b. Changes the function mag_to_lightness to use log(sqrt(r)+1) instead of log(r+1)

None of these need explanation except the last subpoint. Previous behavior was so dark as to obscure tick marks even on the doctest plots, and so light as to make plotting even z squared look pretty vague.  This only adds about .02 ms on average to plots, which means that complex_plot(sqrt) takes a little bit longer but complex_plot(zeta) is indistinguishable from before in timing.  One can quibble about it, but this makes zeros still recognizable for polynomials while not allowing them to drown out for zeta, and makes anything yielding high moduli easier to view, while incurring a very modest performance hit, which seems in line with the pedagogical point of complex_plot.

My main concern with this is that converting to something to Cython that is not time critical adds unnecessary build time to the Sage library.  Doing development on Cython files is a lot more annoying than with Python files.  But, I think the other changes are useful.

+1 -- I strongly agree with this.  One also can't trace through code
that is in Cython nearly so easily as with Python.  One should only
Cythonize code where there is a clear important benefit to doing so.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
I get doctest errors on sage.math and my laptop.  They seem to be to do with graph coloring rather than the valuable refactor of the Color stuff.  Could these be separated?

I should have caught this - I only tested files in plot/, forgot about the graphs/ changes...

At first I thought that somehow rainbow() was giving only one color to all these graphs (which have n=3) but as far as I can tell rainbow works fine.  And (for example) doing

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_coloring import *
sage: G = Graph({0:[1,2,3],1:[2]})
sage: list(all_graph_colorings(G,3))
```
gives the correct answer.  For some reason something in the generator (as opposed to list) definition of all_graph_colorings() is causing a problem, but why this wouldn't have cropped up before is puzzling.  I will try to look at it soon.

I finally figured out what is going on.  

```
sage: rainbow(3)
['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff']
sage: rainbow(int(3))
['#ff0000', '#ff0000', '#ff0000']
```
This is because 

```
sage: int(1)/3
1/3
sage: int(1)/int(3)
0
```
and in all the above cases I believe the rainbow input is a Python int coming from a range() or len().  Very annoying.

The patch trac_6269.patch should now pass graph and plot doctests, at least it does for me.

But rlm says in the same thread,  "These are all due to the removal of graph_isom.pyx, and I will be...".  So that should not be the problem.  In fact, I am not sure how one can NOT include graph stuff, because the graph theory modules need some of the coloring stuff, e.g. in graph_colorings.py and several other such files there is the line

and that is no longer where rainbow lives.  Now, it is true that rainbow lives in the global namespace, so maybe those lines are all redundant, but as it stands they might cause failure at startup because sage.plot.plot doesn't have rainbow anymore.  

Since sage.plot.plot does import rainbow, maybe that's enough for rainbow to be re-imported into those files from there for now.
