Scipy 0.7 includes known issues with python 2.6. The first Bugfix release (0.7.1) is already available. 

On [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/), scipy 0.7 is only offered for use with python 2.4 or 2.5. scipy 0.7.1 on the other hand is available with support for python 2.6 which also seems to require numpy 1.3.0 or above.
Since sage now includes python 2.6, scipy should be updated to the latest version.

This ticket was created as a result of this [support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/e102047bfd334027/a75bd16035329155).
