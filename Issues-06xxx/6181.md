If you extract r-2.6.1.p22.spkg on Linux with "tar jxvf" you'll see lots of stuff like this:

```
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/grid.layout.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/._grid.lines.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/grid.lines.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/._grid.locator.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/grid.locator.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/._grid.ls.Rd
r-2.6.1.p22/src/src/library/grid/man/grid.ls.Rd
```

These ._ files are all caused by making the tarball on OS X, and shouldn't be there.
