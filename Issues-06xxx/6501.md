Following this message on SAGE-devel :
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9da47e06bcdfc49f

This is the package containing Clp/Cbc, the LP solvers from Coin-Or http://www.coin-or.org/.

The goal is to built a native LP support for sage using GLPK ( a different solver ) because of License problems. This being said, Coin-OR is way more efficient and should be preferred by most people needing LP solvers ( with or without integer variables )

This package only contains the sources of the last Cbc release, installed with the original Makefile in SAGE.

It can be downloaded there : http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nathann.Cohen/cbc.spkg
