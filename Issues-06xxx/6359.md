Note:  In order to get things to work, I did the following:

1) Took at 4.0.2 source tarball.

2) Replaced the spkgs in the tarball with the ones above.

3) Extracted the sage-*.spkg tarball, applied trac_6359-1.patch, and re "sage -spkg"'d it.

4) It's not necessary to apply the other two patches to get things up and running.

Nicolas: That's good to hear.  The changes were pretty minimal.

I've updated the python-2.6.2.spkg to copy over site-packages from 2.5 to 2.6.  I think this should do okay on upgrades.  I also added the ipython spkg update which was needed.

Won't some packages need to have Python 2.6 actually do the installing? I am dubious that just copying over will work (although, of course, I wouldn't know).

Well, on top of alpha0, trac_6359-1.patch fails to apply, although I can't tell why at all- when I went in to fix the rejects (which weren't produced in the working directory like hg said they were), everything looked exactly the same. So after fixing the rest of the patch by hand, I repackaged Sage and forced the above packages to build.

Telling Sage to build very quickly fails, as it cannot find Jinja. So I force setuptools and jinja to build. The next problem is numpy. 
Forcing numpy to build does not solve the problem, either:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 704, in <module>
    queue = compile_command_list(ext_modules, deps)
  File "setup.py", line 664, in compile_command_list
    dep_file, dep_time = deps.newest_dep(f)
  File "setup.py", line 579, in newest_dep
    for f in self.all_deps(filename):
  File "setup.py", line 560, in all_deps
    for f in self.immediate_deps(filename):
  File "setup.py", line 542, in immediate_deps
    self._deps[filename] = self.parse_deps(filename)
  File "setup.py", line 532, in parse_deps
    raise IOError, "could not find dependency %s included in %s."%(path, filename)
IOError: could not find dependency sage/plot/numpy.pxd included in sage/plot/complex_plot.pyx.
sage: There was an error installing modified sage library code.
```

Do we need to bump the version numbers for all the packages that go into site-packages (I can do this by hand if necessary)? This would make upgrading work for sure.

Also, your step 4) above is a bit lacking. What did you have to do, exactly, to get things up and running?

With the new Python spkg installed, `import _ssl` fails.

This is relevant:

http://www.webtop.com.au/compiling-python-with-ssl-support

One problem is that `Modules/_ssl.c` uses a lot more of OpenSSL than it used to, and much of what is used is not provided by the gnutls compatibility layer.
