The help for polygon2d? says:

```
 Type ``polygon.options`` for a dictionary of the default 
    options for polygons.  You can change this to change 
```
but it should say

```
 Type ``polygon2d.options`` for a dictionary of the default 
    options for polygons.  You can change this to change 
```

And for the record I think it is unfortunate that somebody changed the function name from polygon to polygon2d, since that it inconsistent with almost all the rest of plotting in Sage, where the 2d version of the function doesn't specifically say it is 2d (e.g., plot, line, text, etc.) Well, there is line2d, to add to the confusion.    The design of Sage graphics is *supposed* to follow the naming scheme in Matheamtica.  In Mathematica there is Polygon and Polygon3D.  That's what Sage should have.

To resolve this patch, either fix the docstring or change the name back to polygon (not polygon2d).  I prefer the latter for consistency with the rest fo the design of sage 2d graphics.

Unfortunately this is pretty hard to change since `polygon` is expected to work for two and three D input.  This patch does take care of the problem.

What I mean, of course, is that it would be hard to change since users probably are using it this way a lot and the deprecation period and all simply isn't worth the effort at this point.  Anyway, needs review.
