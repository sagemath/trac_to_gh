Was that with the large database installed?  that would make sense -- it needs the MW basis of the two curves whose conductors are 13068 and 52272, which it cannot find unless the optional package is installed.

I don't think I know how to tag that test to expect two warnings lines iff that package is not installed.  Would it work to put an initial "..." in front of the output?

**Attachment:** [trac_6310.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6310/trac_6310.patch.gz)

I have fixed it by running that example with "proof=False" and explaining in the accompanying text that this is only needed to avoid warnings when the optional database is not installed.

Tested both with and without the database installed!
