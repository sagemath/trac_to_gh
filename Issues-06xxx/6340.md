It looks like #6559 functionality is better to incorporate first.  What happens after its inclusion with the following?

```
sage: var('z',ns=False)
```

```
sage: var('z',ns=True)
```
The results of these will help create a new patch, though that may not happen for a bit.  

Alternately, since this one is small, one could review it positively (if it deserves to be) :) and then base the bigger patch at #6559 on it.

Sorry for not pointing this out earlier, but I suggest changing the block:

```
    if ('ns', False) in kwds.items(): 
        raise NotImplementedError, "The new (Pynac) symbolics are now the only symbolics; please do not use keyword `ns` any longer." 
    if ('ns', True) in kwds.items(): 
        from sage.misc.misc import deprecation 
        deprecation("The new (Pynac) symbolics are now the only symbolics; please do not use keyword 'ns' any longer.") 
```

with

```
    if kwds.has_key('ns'):
        if kwds['ns']:
            from sage.misc.misc import deprecation 
            deprecation("The new (Pynac) symbolics are now the only symbolics; please do not use keyword 'ns' any longer.") 
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError, "The new (Pynac) symbolics are now the only symbolics; please do not use keyword `ns` any longer." 
```

Even if `kwds` is expected to be empty, it is a waste to call `.items()`.

Putting a check that `*args` is empty would also help. Dropping arguments silently is not very user friendly.
