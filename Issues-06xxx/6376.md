```
sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: g = f(-x).diff(x); g
-D[0](f)(-x)
sage: g._maxima_init_()
"(diff('f(x), x, 1))*(-1)"
```

Notice that the `-x` inside f is totally ignored!  This is because of code in the derivative method around line 454 of `sage/symbolic/expression_conversion.py`

Changing the line

```
args = ex.args()
```

to 

```
args = ex.operands()
```

"fixes" the problem, in that a NotImplementedError gets raised, instead of a wrong result returned.  This is **way** better than the current situation, and we better fix this asap.  

A better fix of course is to implement proper conversion. mhansen wrote this code, so maybe it would be easy for him.

fixed with patch at  #7401 which waits for review.

```
sage: f(x) = function('f',x)
sage: g = f(-x).diff(x); g
-D[0](f)(-x)
sage: g._maxima_init_()
"(at(diff('f(dummy_var_der), dummy_var_der,1),dummy_var_der=-x))*(-1)"

The patch is attached to #7401

#6376 is not doctested, since I did not know about this issue when finished patch for #7401. It could be easily doctested, but doctests in #7401 are equivalent to #6376.
