This is inconsistent with solve_right and contrary to the documentation. 

```
sage: A = random_matrix(ZZ, 5)
sage: b = vector(ZZ, range(5))
sage: A.solve_left(b)
[    47/630  -233/1170       2/65     34/819 -5269/8190]
sage: A.solve_left(b).parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 5 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
