Symbolic expressions have two methods to obtain series expansions. The `taylor()` method is a wrapper around maxima's `taylor` command. The result of this is not always a Taylor series, which leads to confusions.

The `series()` method was introduced in the pynac-based symbolics. ATM, it is a thin wrapper around GiNaC series expansions. This also plays well with the symbolic functions, etc. introduced based on Pynac/GiNaC.

We should deprecate the `taylor()` method and add an `algorith=` argument to `series()`. The default behavior can be to call GiNaC and fall back to maxima if that fails.

In short, we should change this ticket to cover this transition. Series expansions in Pynac need more work to match what maxima does. That should be tracked on the pynac issue tracker:
