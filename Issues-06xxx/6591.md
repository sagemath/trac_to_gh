```
This small patch implements:

```
sage: view(object, viewer = "pdf")
```
which works even under the notebook.

Typical use cases:

* you prefer your pdf browser to your dvi browser
* you want to view latex snippets which are not displayed well in dvi viewers or jsmath (e.g. tikzpicture) 

Potential extensions: view(object, viewer='png'), view(object, viewer='html') 

Note: this partially reinstates #5920 which got a positive review and was said to be merged and closed, but apparently later discarded upon the merge of the overlapping #6012 (pdflatex option)


This patch also adds a tightpage option, which uses the preview package to create a document with each displaymath on a single page whose size is exactly that of the displaymath. This is for example useful for very large pictures (graphs!) generated with tikz.

Suggestions for how to doctest this are welcome.

Oops, sorry, I forgot about the doc ... Thanks!

In the meantime, I actually found a shortcoming in tightpage. I'll probably add a little fix later today.

Positive review.  A few very minor doc fixes added (for the change from `\LaTeX` to `LaTeX`, it seems that jsMath doesn't know about this command, so it doesn't look good in the notebook with #5653 applied).

Apply patches trac_6591_view_viewer_tightpage-nt.patch and trac_6591-doc2.patch.

I think it's fine to leave the description of notebook mode second; it would take actual thought to change it at this point.  When I worked on this docstring a while ago, my feeling was that since most of the options are ignored in notebook mode, command-line mode should come first.
