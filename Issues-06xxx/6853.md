<div id="comment:0"></div>

There is an incomplete closing script tag in `server/notebook/templates/notebook/head.tmpl`:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript/sage3d.js"></script
```

I don't know if this actually affects any rendering engine.  I just noticed it when viewing the source for a worksheet page in Firefox.

This depends on #6568.

I'm not sure about why these lines appear in the patch:

```
-{% endmacro %}
\ No newline at end of file
+{% endmacro %}
```
These also appear in the new patch at #6459.

Those lines mean the file that's being patched had no newline and the end of the file, but the new one does. (That's an improvement.)
In short, nothing to worry about.

Anyway, this patch applies (after #6568) and is clearly correct, so positive review.
