Sage ships an excellent revision control software but uses a rather simple approach to worksheet version-ing. It would be nice if a hg repository was used behind the scenes. This would enable diffs, cool sharing (just pull my worksheet) and collaboration.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Some other ideas from #301:

* Show history without code lines.
* Show history without SAGE command line markup
* Show history by time
* Show activity graphs by time
* Show history for worksheets
* Show history for cell in worksheet
  * Show differences between two edits in a cell

Naturally not all of these would be implemented here, but any that aren't could be moved to another ticket.  Should sagenb, or the universe, last that long.
