This spkg and patch updates the Frobby library that is already an optional component of Sage, and gives it a Cython interface to a shared library instead of the pexpect interface in the current Frobby spkg. It also exposes more functionality. Functionality not currently in sage:

- Multigraded Hilbert-Poincare series
- Alexander dual of monomial ideals (already in the previous Frobby spkg)
- Maximal standard monomials of monomial ideals
- Irreducible decomposition of monomial ideals
- Optimization of any linear function over the maximal standard monomials of a monomial ideal using branch-and-bound.

The patch applies cleanly to Sage 4.0.1, and the spkg is at

  http://www.daimi.au.dk/~bjarke/frobby-0.8.0.spkg

Although I know about as much as my dog about Solaris, I gave it a try on t2.  After downloading the 0.8.0 spkg from trac I did:

```
sage -sh
export GMPLIB=/home/wstein/sparc/sage-3.4.1.rc4-mark-gcc-4.3.3/local
$MAKE library MODE=shared ldflags="$LDFLAGS" GMP_INC_DIR="$GMPLIB"
```

and things compiled well for a while until I got:

```

This ticket is about an old-style spkg for frobby version 0.8.0. We now have frobby 0.9.0 in a new-style sage package. I know that in some examples in which Singular fails with an int overflow, frobby starts to use very much memory and takes a very long time. Moreover, it seems that the computation of multivariate Hilbert series has a bug: Frobby uses the base ring of the polynomial ring as the base ring of the Hilbert series (but Hilbert series are supposed to have integral coefficients). Moreover, if one uses integral coefficients, the monomials that are not standard monomials appear with coefficient TWO, but should of course have coefficient zero, in the expansion of the multivariate Hilbert series.

  sage: R.<x,y,z,w>=QQ[]
  sage: I = R*[x^3,x^2*y,x*z]
  sage: D = ~PowerSeriesRing(QQ,'x,y,z,w')((x-1)*(y-1)*(z-1)*(w-1))
  sage: frobby.hilbert(I)
  x^3*y*z + x^3*y + x^3*z + x^2*y*z + x^3 + x^2*y + x*z + 1
  sage: (frobby.hilbert(I)*D)[:4]
  1 + x + y + z + w + x^2 + x*y + 2*x*z + x*w + y^2 + y*z + y*w + z^2 +
  z*w + w^2 + 2*x^3 + 2*x^2*y + 2*x^2*z + x^2*w + x*y^2 + 2*x*y*z +
  x*y*w + 2*x*z^2 + 2*x*z*w + x*w^2 + y^3 + y^2*z + y^2*w + y*z^2 +
  y*z*w + y*w^2 + z^3 + z^2*w + z*w^2 + w^3 + O(x, y, z, w)^12
```

So, I think that frobby should not be the default backend for Hilbert series.

However, it may still be a good idea to provide a Cython interface. So, question: Should the Cython-interface part of the patch be changed into a branch?
