```
There is a silly bug in computing the number of facets of non-reflexive lattice polytopes:

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope(matrix([1, 2]))
sage: p.nfacets()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: object of type 'sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense' has no len()
```
The attached one-line patch fixes it:

```
sage: p = LatticePolytope(matrix([1, 2]))
sage: p.nfacets()
2
```
