I downloaded the new package and installed it via `sage -i`.  TinyMCE seems to work for me just as it did previously, in Cr3, FF3.5, and O9 on Linux and Cr2, FF3.5, IE8, S4, and O9 on Windows XP.   However, I can't test the new spkg in any Mac OS browsers or with Word.  I did have success with the 'paste-from-Word' feature --- from OpenOffice.org Writer v3.0.1 on Linux.  In particular, I was able to "paste," through the dialog, tables and variously-formatted text.

The package contents conform to the [guidelines](http://wiki.sagemath.org/SPKG_Audit).

Pending a confirmation that it works properly on Macs, particularly in Safari, I give the new spkg a positive review.

For what it's worth, the patch at #6459 still works for me after the upgrade.
