Plotting big sparse matrices doesn't even work since it automatically converts the matrix to a dense matrix, instead of calling the spy() function.

This took a very long time before, if it was even possible.

```
        sage: A=random_matrix(ZZ,100000,density=.00001,sparse=True)
        sage: matrix_plot(A,marker=',')

It would be really great if this was reviewed in time for the Monday deadline for 4.1.1.  This is a simple change that makes plotting sparse matrices possible. Currently, it is very, very slow or is not even really possible to plot large sparse matrices because Sage immediately converts the matrix to a dense matrix.

This installs fine (amd64 ubuntu 9.04, sage 4.1.1.alpha0) and I'm running tests now. However, why is it that

```
sage: B = random_matrix(ZZ, 10, 20, density=.4, sparse=True, x = 10)
sage: matrix_plot(B, cmap='hsv').show(axes=False)
```
returns a ble-and white scatterplot, but

```
sage: C = random_matrix(ZZ, 10, 20, x = 10)
sage: matrix_plot(C, cmap='hsv').show(axes=False)
```
returns a multi-colored plot? The docstring indicates that the colors plotted
indicate the relative difference in sizes between the matrix entries. This seems
to be incorrect, unless I am missing something, in the sparse case. Should a 
comment to this effect be added to the docstring?

Yes, looks good and passes sage -testall (intel macbook, OS 10.4.11) except for

```
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
```
They seem unrelated. As far as I am concerned, this gets a positive review.
