Plotting big sparse matrices doesn't even work since it automatically converts the matrix to a dense matrix, instead of calling the spy() function.

This took a very long time before, if it was even possible.

```
        sage: A=random_matrix(ZZ,100000,density=.00001,sparse=True)
        sage: matrix_plot(A,marker=',')

This installs fine (amd64 ubuntu 9.04, sage 4.1.1.alpha0) and I'm running tests now. However, why is it that

```
sage: B = random_matrix(ZZ, 10, 20, density=.4, sparse=True, x = 10)
sage: matrix_plot(B, cmap='hsv').show(axes=False)
```
returns a ble-and white scatterplot, but

```
sage: C = random_matrix(ZZ, 10, 20, x = 10)
sage: matrix_plot(C, cmap='hsv').show(axes=False)
```
returns a multi-colored plot? The docstring indicates that the colors plotted
indicate the relative difference in sizes between the matrix entries. This seems
to be incorrect, unless I am missing something, in the sparse case. Should a 
comment to this effect be added to the docstring?

Yes, looks good and passes sage -testall (intel macbook, OS 10.4.11) except for

```
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
```
They seem unrelated. As far as I am concerned, this gets a positive review.
