It is possible now to create a lattice polytope with rational vertices, which allows things to work, but causes wrong answers:

```
sage: m = matrix([1/2, 3/2])
sage: m
[1/2 3/2]
sage: LatticePolytope(m).points()
[0 1]
```
This patch adds an extra check/conversion to the constructor to prevent this:

```
sage: m = matrix([1/2, 3/2])
sage: m
[1/2 3/2]
sage: LatticePolytope(m).points()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Points must be integral!
Given:
[1/2 3/2]
```
