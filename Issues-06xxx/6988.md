The issue is that in LaTeX, lists can only be nested four deep, and the file rings/ring.pyx had 6 levels of nesting.  The attached patch rephrases things so that there are only 4 levels of nesting again.

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on the making the notebook a standalone package.
