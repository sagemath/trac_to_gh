There is an option for specifying the thickness/width of an edge in a graph ("thickness").  For a graph `G`,

`G.plot(thickness=10)`

works as expected, but

`show(G, thickness=10)`

raises an error about the option name being unrecognized.

Also, I couldn't find any mention of this parameter in the documentation anywhere.
