It fixes those issues, but not directly.

In setup_for_eval_on_grid, we should check for not just types.FunctionType, but instead for (types.FunctionType, types.LambdaType, types.BuiltinFunctionType, types.BuiltinMethodType).  Also, everything should be converted from fast_float to fast_callable.  This would be a separate ticket.

There seems to be a regression: `%time complex_plot(exp(x)-sin(x), (-10, 10), (-10, 10))` takes 21 seconds before the patch, but 28 seconds after the patch for me.

Note:

```
sage: f(x)=exp(x)-sin(x)
sage: fcomplex=fast_callable(f, domain=complex, expect_one_var=True)sage: fCDF=fast_callable(f, domain=CDF, expect_one_var=True)
sage: %timeit f(4j)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.21 ms per loop
sage: %timeit fcomplex(4j)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.7 ms per loop
sage: %timeit fCDF(4j)
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.94 µs per loop
```

So maybe the fast_callable in the patch should use domain CDF!

(this seems really odd to me, but I can't argue with the timings above!)

These don't apply for me properly - I don't have the stuff after the Riemann Zeta function and options, but before the actual code, e.g.

```
sage: P = complex_plot(f, (-10, 10), (-10, 10)) 
sage: Q = complex_plot(g, (-10, 10), (-10, 10)) 
sage: R = complex_plot(h, (-10, 10), (-10, 10))

Is that in some other patch, or was it removed before 4.1.2.alpha2?
