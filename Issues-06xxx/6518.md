I got this while doctesting a patch with 4.1:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage-s/sage/symbolic/expression_conversions.py"
/home/burcin/sage/sage-4.1/local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/misc/misc.py:1901: DeprecationWarning: functions overriding warnings.showwarning() must support the 'line' argument
  warn(message, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=3)
```

Apparently showwarning got a new argument in Python 2.6, as stated here:

http://docs.python.org/library/warnings.html#showwarning/show

Attached patch fixes the `sage-doctest` script to use the new call signature.
