In Firefox 3.5 on Linux, jsMath's `cmmi10` font appears to be decoded improperly.  Try this [test](http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/symbols/cmmi10.html).  Other fonts seem fine.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/61bf1226d39ecf1d/c330223e1970d9c6?#c330223e1970d9c6) for more.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I've attached a preliminary workaround.  Suggested directions:

* Save `cmmi10.js` as `$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript/jsmath/cmmi10.js`
* Around line 1750 of `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/notebook.py`, replace

```
            head += '<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/jsmath/jsMath.js"></script>\n'
```
with

```
            head += '<script type="text/javascript" src="/javascript_local/jsmath/jsMath.js"></script>\n'
            head += '<script type="text/javascript">jsMath.Setup.UserEvent["pre-font"] = function () { jsMath.Setup.Script("cmmi10.js"); };</script>\n'
```
* `sage -br`
* Optional tests: Load and execute `cmmi10.txt` as a worksheet in the notebook.

This seems to work for me, but I haven't accounted for every character.  Feel free to improve the code or tests!
