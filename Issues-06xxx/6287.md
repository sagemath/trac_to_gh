When we upgraded Sage from Clisp to ECL we forgot to make it so

```
sage -lisp
``` 
works and runs ecl.  Right now it still runs clisp if that happens to be on your system, which is silly.

Despite having the directory with 'clisp' early in the path, maxima in Sage still pick up 'ecl'. 

Sorry, but I don't feel able to test this, as I can't build clisp and are not really sure what should happen.

Hi,
The whole point of the ticket is that clisp is no longer used and that sage should look for ecl instead. The patch tells 'sage -lisp' to use ecl instead of clisp. I also added a 'sage -ecl' which does the same thing. In other words, if either command is used from the shell you get the ecl console. I took out 'sage -clisp' but should it stay for if someone wants it?

I agree that it should be removed. All commands of the form `sage -program` run the version of `program` distributed with sage. Since we are no longer distributing clisp, keeping the clisp alias has the potential of causing confusion for a user.

**Positive review**: the patch applies cleanly on top of sage-4.1.1; and `sage -ecl` and `sage -lisp` now work as they should.
