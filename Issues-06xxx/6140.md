Attachment: **[numpy-1.3.0-update.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6140/numpy-1.3.0-update.patch.gz)**

There are a few minor doctest updates that need to be done.  See above for a patch which addresses at least some of these.

When doing all doctests on 4.0.rc0, I get failures in:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/misc/banner.py # 5 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/matrix_symbolic_dense.pyx # 3 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/matrix/tests.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/calculus/functions.py # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/plot/plot_field.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

However, some of these failures are from rc0, not from the numpy update.  The patch above corrects the failures that I know are from the numpy updated.  Please let me know if there are any other doctests that need to be updated in this ticket.

This looks good. I'm attaching a second patch for that one doctest failure. 

For the record, this spkg and the two patches have been merged in `4.0.2.alpha0` -- but I want to take a few minutes and carefully close all the appropriate tickets linked in the discussion above, so I'll officially close this tomorrow.

I'm going to be bold and say that my one-character patch doesn't really need a review; if someone wants to agree that it's fine, that wouldn't be bad.
