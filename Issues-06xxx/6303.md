Note that this failure was reported on 32 bit linux. So I don't see it is any good to report it good for sage.math or OS X 10.5.

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx"
	 [24.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
```

On Fedora 9, 32 bit.

So also a positive review from here.
