As I said on sage-devel, this patch does two things: (1) fix the doctest so it does not depend on the ordering of primes_above() output; (2) fix primes_above to it (partially) orders its output as its docstring describes.

Note that this failure was reported on 32 bit linux. So I don't see it is any good to report it good for sage.math or OS X 10.5.

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx"

All tests passed!

On Fedora 9, 32 bit.

So also a positive review from here.
