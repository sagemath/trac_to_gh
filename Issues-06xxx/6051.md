Singular 3-1-0 supports coefficient rings which are not fields. In particular, it supports ZZ and ZZ/nZZ now. We should support those natively too.

The attached patch enables the Singular coefficient rings natively. It passes doctests except: 

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage/sage/rings/polynomial/toy_d_basis.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 1049.8 seconds
```
which I reported upstream at

This is confusing, and the first part (multivariate rings) behave differently on 32 and 64 bit machines.  Any thoughts, Martin?

```
sage: P.<x,y,z> = Integers(2^32)[]
sage: P(2^32-1)
-1
sage: P.<x> = Integers(2^32)[]
sage: P(2^32-1)
