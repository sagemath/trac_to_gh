	 [4.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 4.7 seconds
[mvngu@mod sage-4.3.2.alpha1]$ ./sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/misc/darwin_utilities.pyx
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/misc/darwin_utilities.pyx"   
	 [4.0 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
