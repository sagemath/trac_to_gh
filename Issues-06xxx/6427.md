The following occur in sage-4.1.alpha1:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long devel/sage/doc/fr/tutorial/programming.rst # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long devel/sage/sage/misc/darwin_utilities.pyx # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

they're both really easy fixes.
