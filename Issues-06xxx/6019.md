I forgot to disable the automatic Hecke-invariance check when calling the submodule constructor to constructing new subspaces of modular forms spaces. 

That meant that the very time-consuming function `_is_hecke_invariant_free_module` was getting called, which slowed down the computation *ridiculously*.

Before:

```
sage: C = CuspForms(12, 8)
sage: time C.new_submodule()
CPU times: user 217.98 s, sys: 0.39 s, total: 218.37 s
Wall time: 229.00 s
Modular Forms subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Forms space of dimension 17 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(12) ofweight 8 over Rational Field
```

After:

```
sage: time C.new_submodule()
CPU times: user 1.55 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 1.57 s
Wall time: 1.58 s
Modular Forms subspace of dimension 2 of Modular Forms space of dimension 17 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(12) ofweight 8 over Rational Field
```

So that's a speedup by a factor of 139 in this example.
