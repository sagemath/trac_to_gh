At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/9b8016e17cc81128) thread, Kiran Kedlaya reported a problem with building cliquer under a 64-bit platform:

```
On 64-bit Fedora 10, I get a build failure in cliquer. The relevant
snippet from the install log is below.

This looks like a case of 32/64 confusion, which I am no stranger to.
This machine runs on a primarily 32-bit network, and in the past we've
discovered various build problems due to this. For instance, the local
gcc in /usr/bin is 64-bit, but the NFS one in /usr/local/bin is 32-
bit, so I have to configure my path appropriately. In this case, it's
somehow trying to find stubs-32.h instead of stubs-64.h, but I don't
know why.
```
John Palmieri also reported at ticket #6681 a similar problem with 64-bit OS X.

See ticket #6681 for an updated cliquer spkg. If that package also builds on 64-bit Fedora 10, then this ticket should be closed as a duplicate of #6681.
