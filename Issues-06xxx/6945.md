There are a number of issues associated with the readline 5.2 in Sage

* #6933 (readline-5.2.p7 builds as 32-bit on Solaris even if SAGE64=yes)
* It does not work on OS X 10.6 #6849 William has sorted these issues out. 
* grep was used on /etc/SuSE-release  - even if the file did not exist. #6844

This spkg hopes to clear them all up. Note its not the first version of readline 6.0 package I've created, hence the directory name. This is an improved version over another. 

It has been tested on 

* 64-bit linux (sage.math)
* Solaris 32-bit SPARC (my box)
* Solaris 64-bit SPARC (my box)
* OS X 32-bit (bsd.math)
* OS X 64-bit (bsd.math)

It would be good if someone could test on Suse linux, as there are some Suse-specific bits in here. One of which I had to very slightly modify, to avoid a warning on every other platform. 

This alone will not sort out all the OS X 10.6 issues (#6849), but it will allow #6933 and #6844 to be closed. 

The spkg, spkg-install and SPKG.txt can be found here:

Added the executable flag to `spkg-install` using `chmod +x spkg-install`. These lines are suspect:

```
if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` == 0 ]; then
if [ $OVERWRITE_READLINE == "true" ]; then
```
Should they be the following instead with only one equal sign?

```
if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` = 0 ]; then
if [ $OVERWRITE_READLINE = "true" ]; then
```
Anyway, all changes have been committed in David Kirkby's name. The package is up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/spkg/standard/readline-6.0.spkg

I'm now testing it under various platforms, including openSUSE 11.1.

An updated readline package is up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/spkg/standard/readline-6.0.spkg

This package includes the following:

* Check David Kirkby's changes in his name.

* Fix some minor typos.

* Change the line

 ```
 if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` == 0 ]; then
 ```
 to

 ```
 if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` -eq 0 ]; then
 ```
 since that conditional is a comparison of integers.

* Change the line

 ```
 if [ $OVERWRITE_READLINE == "true" ]; then
 ```
 to

 ```
 if [ $OVERWRITE_READLINE = "true" ]; then
 ```

I have been having trouble building Sage 4.1.2.alpha1 from scratch with readline 6.0 on openSUSE 11.1. The problem is due to the variable `OVERWRITE_READLINE` in `spkg-install`, which is set to true on openSUSE 11.1. That variable was introduced when the version of readline that was shipped with Sage was 5.2, which matches the readline version on openSUSE 11.1. When upgrading to readline 6.0, we no longer need that variable. I have commented out references to that variable in `spkg-install`:

```
# OVERWRITE_READLINE=false; export OVERWRITE_READLINE                           

# First we check for OpenSUSE 11.1 since bash is linked dynamically with a      
# readline that breaks when we build Sage's readline, so we work around this    
# for now.                                                                      

if [ -f /etc/SuSE-release ]; then
    if [ `grep 11.1 /etc/SuSE-release > /dev/null; echo $?` -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "OpenSUSE 11.1 detected"
        if [ -d /usr/include/readline/ ]; then
            echo "The development version of libreadline is installed -> copying"
            if [ `uname -p` = "x86_64" ]; then
