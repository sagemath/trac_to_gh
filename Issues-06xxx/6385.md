In python imports are relative by default, so "import sage" does not
mean what you think.   I think long ago I hacked around this problem
for just typing "sage" to start sage, by making it change to a
different directory during startup.   (I vaguely recall doing that
specifically to get Sage to work on Cygwin, actually.)

So I think the above should be considered a bug, and you should
definitely report it to trac.  Probably the fix is to change the
directory during part of Sage startup, to thwart Python's relative
import system.
