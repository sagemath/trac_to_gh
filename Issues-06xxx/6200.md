Assumes that mpmath has been added to Sage (#6196)

Patch summary:

Use mpmath to compute numerical values of constants.

Previously khinchin, mertens and twinprime were LimitedPrecisionConstant,
but with this patch they can be computed to any precision.

The patch also adds the Glaisher constant (which is available in mpmath)
and corrects the name of the Mertens constant.
