Notice that this plot is mostly white, but the white space represents two different values---one is above the top contour, the other is below the bottom contour.

We ought to make it so that stuff above/below the requested contours is shaded appropriately.

```
var('x,y')
contour_plot(x-y^2,(x,-5,5),(y,-3,3),contours=[-4,0,1])
```
