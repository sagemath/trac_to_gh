Notice that this plot is mostly white, but the white space represents two different values---one is above the top contour, the other is below the bottom contour.

We ought to make it so that stuff above/below the requested contours is shaded appropriately.

```
var('x,y')
contour_plot(x-y^2,(x,-5,5),(y,-3,3),contours=[-4,0,1])
```

I wonder if #5221 fixes this.  I don't have an up-to-date alpha to test this, though.

Positive review.  I wonder if this is also the 'right' way to have fixed #5221, since you mention that ticket? See [this link](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html?highlight=contourf#matplotlib.pyplot.contourf).

Note to release manager: this depends on #4898.
