Matt Riesler wrote on sage-support:

```
Is it possible to have max behave as you would expect with a symbolic
expression, i.e. wait until you evaluate it or restrict the domain  to
check what is the maximum of the two or more values.
```

Then kcrisman:

```
Might there be a way to do something that doesn't conflict with the
builtin max function in the same way as the (nearly reviewed) #3587
seems to avoid conflict with the builtin sum function?  This would be
pretty useful, as currently:

sage: var('x,y')
(x, y)
sage: max(x,y)
x
sage: f(x)=1+x;g(x)=2-x
sage: max(f,g)
x |--> x + 1

which last result is... debatable.
```

Here is a the thread, which has a simple minded implementation for symbolic max:

http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/aead15de586984d8


We should make sure the symbolic implementations don't slow down the current builtin python `max()` and `min()` too much. If they do, these functions should still be available under a different name.

attachment:trac_6949-symbolic_min_max.patch provides basic implementations of `max_symbolic()` and `min_symbolic()` functions that work as expected when the input contains symbolic expressions.

The symbolic versions are significantly slower than Python's builtin `min()` and `max()`, so replacing the builtin functions with these is not possible at this point.

I applied the patch on top of 4.3.5:

```
sage: f(x) = max_symbolic(sin(x), cos(x))
sage: f(0)
1
sage: f
x |--> max(sin(x), cos(x))
sage: f(1)
max(sin(1), cos(1))
```
So far, so good. But:

```
sage: N(f(1))

Thanks for the review.

The new patch attachment:trac_6949-symbolic_min_max.take2.patch replaces the previous one, and implements `_evalf_()` methods for numeric evaluation. I also created a base class with the common code from `__call__()` and `_eval_()` methods.

Can you take another look?

Thanks a lot for testing this. I uploaded a new patch in attachment:trac_6949-symbolic_min_max.take3.patch which should cover many corner cases not handled properly before. The aim is to make `{max,min}_symbolic()` behave almost identical to the builtin `min()` and `max()`.

Can you try and break it again? :)
