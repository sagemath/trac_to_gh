Maple can simplify all but the first of the following examples:

```
%maple
print(simplify(binomial(n,2)+binomial(n+1,2)));
print(simplify(factorial(n)/factorial(n-2)/2 + factorial(n+1)/factorial(n-1)/2));
print(simplify(factorial(n+1)/factorial(n)));
print(simplify(binomial(n,k)*factorial(k)*factorial(n-k)));
```

returns

```
binomial(n,2)+binomial(n+1,2)
n^2
n+1
n!
```

Sage can simplify only the first:

```
var('n,k')
print (binomial(n,2) + binomial(n+1,2)).simplify_full()
print (factorial(n)/factorial(n-2)/2 + factorial(n+1)/factorial(n)/2).simplify_full()
print (factorial(n+1)/factorial(n)).simplify_full()
print (binomial(n,k)*factorial(k)*factorial(n-k)).simplify_full()
```

returns

```
n^2
1/2*(factorial(n - 2)*factorial(n + 1) + factorial(n)^2)/(factorial(n - 2)*factorial(n))
factorial(n + 1)/factorial(n)

A related discussion on sage-devel is [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/58db110fc55b11e5](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/58db110fc55b11e5).

The lack of simplification is a bug, or at least very poorly exposed functionality, in Maxima.  One would think that simplify would include this... but instead one needs to expose Maxima's *minfactorial*:

```
(%i1) fullratsimp(factorial(n)/factorial(n-1));
                                      n!
(%o1)                              --------
                                   (n - 1)!
(%i2) minfactorial(factorial(n)/factorial(n-1));
(%o2)                                  n
```
This should not be hard to add to simplify_full, though.

Also note that the last issue is addressed by #6197.

Looks good to me.

We might want to improve simplify_full so that we don't have 4 round trips to Maxima (convert to maxima, run all of the simplification commands on the MaximaElement, and then finally convert back to an Expression.)
