Generators of homology now computable via generators=true option in the homology() method of chain_complex.

Known issues:  If S is a simplicial complex, S.homology(generators=true) has not been directly implemented.  Furthermore, S.chain_complex().homology(generators=true) computes the generators based on the order in which simplices are chosen for computing S.chain_complex() -- which is not guaranteed to be the same order in which simplices are listed in S.

Replying to [sault](#comment%3A2):

Thanks for working on this; I hope we can get it into shape soon, and then into Sage.

> Known issues:  If S is a simplicial complex, S.homology(generators=true) has not been directly implemented.  

I know a good way to deal with this, and I'll eventually submit a patch on another ticket that takes care of it (as part of an implementation of cubical complexes and Delta-complexes, among other things).

> Furthermore, S.chain_complex().homology(generators=true) computes the generators based on the order in which simplices are chosen for computing S.chain_complex() -- which is not guaranteed to be the same order in which simplices are listed in S.

I wonder what we can do to fix this.  It might be a lot of work; I'm not sure.  Maybe when we build the chain complex, modify the cached list of simplices of S?  This is something to think about for another ticket, not this one.

There are three problems with this patch: the main one is that it doesn't work with field coefficients:

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: C = T.chain_complex()
sage: C.homology(base_ring=QQ, generators=True)
{0: Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field, 1: Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field, 2: (Vector space of dimension 1 over Rational Field, [ 1 -1 -1 -1  1 -1 -1  1  1  1  1  1 -1 -1])}
```
It only returns generators in dimensions where there is no incoming differential. When you fix this, add a doctest like

```
sage: T = simplicial_complexes.Torus()
sage: C = T.chain_complex()
sage: C.homology(1, base_ring=QQ, generators=True)
???
```

The second problem is the documentation: you should explain (briefly) the format of the output when "generators" is True: it's giving a matrix, and you should say exactly what this matrix represents.

The third issue is minor: the indentation in the docstrings is important, but you changed it, so it gives errors when producing the reference manual.  The docstring itself also looks bad: from the notebook, define a chain complex C and evaluate "C.homology?" to see what the formatted docstring looks like.  Or do `browse_sage_doc(C.homology)` from the command line.

Hi Shaun,
