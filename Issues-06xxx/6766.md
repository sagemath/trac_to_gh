```
The patch provides a much faster method for computing powers of commutative factorizations.  This implements a suggestion made by John Cremona in #5188. 
The speed-up is most marked for factorizations of ideals in number fields.
Before:

```
sage: f = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a').factor(47)
sage: timeit('f^10')
5 loops, best of 3: 134 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: f = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a').factor(47)
sage: timeit('f^10')
625 loops, best of 3: 571 µs per loop
```

In addition, five redundant lines have been removed from the `__init__` function of the `Factorization` class.

It would be nice if there are more code to illustrate timings before and after applying the patch. As I see it, the patch claims to optimize an operation and Francis has provided one example. Is it possible to provide some more examples of before and after timing statistics? Such examples goes very well with release tours, in which features are being showcased.
