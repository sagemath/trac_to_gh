```
The patch provides a much faster method for computing powers of commutative factorizations.  This implements a suggestion made by John Cremona in #5188. 
The speed-up is most marked for factorizations of ideals in number fields.
Before:

```
sage: f = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a').factor(47)
sage: timeit('f^10')
5 loops, best of 3: 134 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: f = NumberField(x^2 + 23, 'a').factor(47)
sage: timeit('f^10')
625 loops, best of 3: 571 Âµs per loop
```

In addition, five redundant lines have been removed from the `__init__` function of the `Factorization` class.
