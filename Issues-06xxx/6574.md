```
E = EllipticCurve('32a1')
D = E.is_quadratic_twist(E)
D, type(D)
```

yields

```
(1, <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>)
```

but

```
D = E.is_quadratic_twist(E.quadratic_twist(5))
D, type(D)
```

gives back

```
(5, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>)
```

I think in the first case, we should also give back the integer 1. The cause of this is in ell_field.py. In the first case we exit is_quadratic_twist at line 353 with

```
return K.one_element()
```

In the second case we exit at the end after
line 394 has changed the type by 

```
if K is rings.QQ:
    D = D.squarefree_part()
```

<a id='comment:1'></a>Well spotted.  But note that this is in ell_field and general fields will not have integers, so the consistent return type should be that of the field.

On second thoughts we already have special code for QQ (calling squarefree_part()) so we could make a special case here and return a square-free integer (in ZZ) in all cases for K=QQ, and otherwise return a field element.  Is that acceptable?

I opted for your second suggestion. In case K is QQ it is ZZ(1) that is returned.
