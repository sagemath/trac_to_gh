```
E = EllipticCurve('32a1')
D = E.is_quadratic_twist(E)
D, type(D)
```

yields

```
(1, <type 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>)
```

but

```
D = E.is_quadratic_twist(E.quadratic_twist(5))
D, type(D)
```

gives back

```
(5, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>)
```

I think in the first case, we should also give back the integer 1. The cause of this is in ell_field.py. In the first case we exit is_quadratic_twist at line 353 with

```
return K.one_element()
```

In the second case we exit at the end after
line 394 has changed the type by 

```
if K is rings.QQ:
    D = D.squarefree_part()
```

Well spotted.  But note that this is in ell_field and general fields will not have integers, so the consistent return type should be that of the field.  So I would rather change the second behaviour, which will mean that when K is QQ we coerce back to ZZ after taking the square-free part.

On second thoughts we already have special code for QQ (calling squarefree_part()) so we could make a special case here and return a square-free integer (in ZZ) in all cases for K=QQ, and otherwise return a field element.  Is that acceptable?
