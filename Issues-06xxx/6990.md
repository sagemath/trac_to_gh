This is the same symtom we had in #2469 (but different problem now), which apparently again crops up with the upgrade to readline-6.0.

I get it with a fresh compile of 4.1.2.alpha2 on ubuntu 9.04.

```

I tried skipped sqlite (by touching spkg/installed/sqlite-3.6.17) and when it started working on libgpg_error, it immediately failed with the same error.

It looks like the shell is getting confused and picking up the wrong libreadline, probably because Arch includes readline 6. On other systems, maybe this isn't a problem because the shell looks for a different readline...I guess?

On Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) amd64, I don't see this error, even though it does use readline 6.

I don't see why the error on Arch would prevent this ticket from getting into 4.1.2. The official supported platforms are CentOS, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Mandriva, openSUSE, OS X 10.5, and Ubuntu. We are now porting to OS X 10.6 as well, a goal of the 4.1.2 release. Testing on all of these platforms, the updated spkg build OK and doctests pass, except for known doctest failures. Having said that, it's good to investigate why Jason's updated spkg failed to build on Arch. But that's another ticket.




An updated spkg based on Jason's is available at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/spkg/standard/python-2.6.2.p3.spkg

The changes from Jason's spkg include:

* Some general clean up of the file `SPKG.txt`. In particular, the typo pointed out by Dan, and some typo fixes. Make lines no more than 75 or so characters wide. Any line wider than that and it would be difficult to read on a standard terminal width, i.e. 80 characters wide.
* Put in the lines "set -e" and "set +e".
