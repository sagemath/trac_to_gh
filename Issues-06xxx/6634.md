I have made a spkg for biopython-1.51, which was released today:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/biopython-1.51.spkg

Running the test suite gives some errors, but some of these are due to missing optional components.  I am inquiring about these on the biopython development list, but I don't think any of them are important enough to block this as an optional spkg.

tkeller,

Can you review this new package?  Besides testing installation, if you check that the spkg-install and SPKG.txt make sense then you can change the heading to [with spkg, positive review] and this can go into the optional packages.

In case you don't know, spkgs are just .tar.bz files with the extension renamed.  I usually unpack a temporary copy somewhere other than my sage folder in order to take a look when reviewing.

Marshall,

I had started looking at this yesterday, so I just finished it now.  It builds successfully on sage.math, 32-bit Linux and 32-bit OSX 10.5.  Let's get it in!

One comment: if you happen to have some toy (or serious) Sage code using biopython, I strongly encourage you to get it into Sage so that we have at least some examples.

```
