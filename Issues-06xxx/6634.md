Biopython 1.49b doesn't install with python-2.6, so we should update the package.  Currently biopython is at 1.51-beta, for which a spkg is provided, but we should switch to 1.51 as soon as it comes out since it will have significant improvements.

Running the test suite gives some errors, but some of these are due to missing optional components.  I am inquiring about these on the biopython development list, but I don't think any of them are important enough to block this as an optional spkg.

<a id='comment:4'></a>tkeller,

Can you review this new package?  Besides testing installation, if you check that the spkg-install and SPKG.txt make sense then you can change the heading to [with spkg, positive review] and this can go into the optional packages.

In case you don't know, spkgs are just .tar.bz files with the extension renamed.  I usually unpack a temporary copy somewhere other than my sage folder in order to take a look when reviewing.

I had started looking at this yesterday, so I just finished it now.  It builds successfully on sage.math, 32-bit Linux and 32-bit OSX 10.5.  Let's get it in!

One comment: if you happen to have some toy (or serious) Sage code using biopython, I strongly encourage you to get it into Sage so that we have at least some examples.
