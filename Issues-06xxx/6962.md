Adds the functions :
* DiGraph.feedback_arc_set
* DiGraph.feedback_vertex_set

You will find a full description of the problem in the docstrings, or there :
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set

The functions use Linear Programming, which needs one of the two optional packages GLPK 

``` 
sage: install_package('cbc')
```
or CBC 

```
sage: install_package('glpk') 
```
installed. You will find a helpful documentation about the construction of the Linear Program in the docstring.

One of the docstrings uses the function vertex_cover from #7600 and #7721

We've used the terminology "edge" with a DiGraph, with the understanding that direction matters when you have a DiGraph.  Is it a possibility to change "feedback_arc_set" to "feedback_edge_set"?

There are two issues:

1. `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sense'`

2. `'Graph' object has no attribute 'min_vertex_cover'`
