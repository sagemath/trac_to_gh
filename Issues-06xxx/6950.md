This is a toy implementation, but still better than nothing. I also added a way of constructing a random Boolean function, I hope it's ok to put both in this ticket.

PS: Is it ok if I cc you Martin?

**Review**

* patch applies cleanly against alpha1
* you shouldn't need `#random` in the doctest because the random seed should be reset before each doctest to make sure that the result is reproducible. 
* there are some very minor line break problems in the HTML reference manual: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/malb/scratch/sage-4.1.2.alpha1/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/crypto/boolean_function.html
* also `..math::` is not properly typesetted (cf. same link)
* doctests pass on sage.math

So almost positive review, module the nitpicks above. Feel free to change it to a positive review once those are addressed.
