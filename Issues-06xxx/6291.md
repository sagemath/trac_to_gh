Missing identity function

AbelianGroup patch
Since we can do;

```
sage: G = DihedralGroup(10)
sage: G.identity()
()
sage: G = SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: G.identity()
()
```
I thought we should be able to do the following

```
sage: G = AbelianGroup([2,2])
sage: G.identity()
1
```

Keywords: **AbelianGroup, identity**
