```
The goal of the patch is to adapt SymmetricGroupAlgebra to categories and to add some improvements. The patch improve SymmetricGroupAlgebra in two ways:
 
- SymmetricGroupAlgebra is now in the category FiniteDimensionalAlgebraWithBasis. Note: A forthcomming patch from Valentin Féray will put it in the correct GroupAlgebras category;

- When creating SGA(n) a coercion from SGA(n-1) is declared.

I'm submitting the patch on behalf on Nicolas after reviewing it.

Depends on the categories framework #5891, #6136.

Cheers,

Florent

Probably so. It would be best handled by some "templated coercion declarations", as I had started to implement in MuPAD. Let's just leave it as is for the moment, until we have enough use cases to come up with the right design.
