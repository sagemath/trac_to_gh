I've written some code that calculates Hermite normal form over a general PID. I wrote this because I needed it for a particular application; I will now go ahead with that as a means of stress-testing the code I've just written, but this ticket is here to remind me.

Attachment [trac_6178.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket6178/trac_6178.patch) by @loefflerd created at 2009-06-02 21:50:15

Here's a patch, which adds echelon form (= Hermite normal form) over PID's. I've also added a simple routine for kernel finding over PID's using Smith form (since the algorithm we had before silently assumed that the base ring was a field).

With this installed, I've done some playing around with free modules over the ring of integers of Q(sqrt(-7)), and it seems to be quite usable. There are unresolved uniqueness issues, because I don't know how to pick a canonical generator for an ideal or a canonical representative for an element modulo an ideal (even in the particular case of number field orders), but I haven't yet found an example where this is a problem :-)

William: I'm CCing you on this, because you seemed interested in the Smith form stuff. In conjunction with your work at #5882 this will mean we can handle all sorts of new kinds of modules.

First a remark:  using #6044 (which as of writing has a positive review but has not been closed yet) solves the issue of non-canonical representatives modulo ideals.

1. Applies fine to 4.0.1 and builds ok.
2. Tests in sage/rings.number_field pass
3. Tests in sage/modules pass
4. tests in sage/matrix pass
5. I tried some examples and they worked fine.

On the last point it is not much use trying to create random matrices over a number field order OK, since OK.random_element() returns a random integer!  I think that should be changed.

That's the second complaint I've heard about this missing functionality just this week!
Definitely this should get implemented.
