The following happens with the 'official' Sage 4.0 on sage.math and on at least one other x_86_64 machine (built from sources and in addition with the singular-3-1-0-spkg). It also occurs at least with sage 3.4.2.

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: R._has_coerce_map_from(R)

So, both uni- and multivariate polynomial rings do not believe that they have a coercion to themselves. Or: Coercion of polynomial rings is seriously broken. 

I really wonder why this does not break hundreds of doc tests. I hope it is ok to make this a blocker.

Simon,

You're using _has_coerce_map_from incorrectly.  The error you get is be cause it is actually a dictionary and not an function.  See:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: R.coerce_map_from(R)
Identity endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R.coerce_map_from(R)
Identity endomorphism of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

I'm going to close this an invalid.  A more appropriate ticket should be opened if there is a failure you're trying to fix.
