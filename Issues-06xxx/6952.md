There's a warning when building the tutorial with the two patches at #6774:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.2.alpha1/devel/sage-main/doc/en/tutorial/tour_graphtheory.rst:91: (WARNING/2) Title underline too short.

Compute maximum matchings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
There are also some stylistic errors that I'll take care of.

Thanks! I learned a few things about writing in ReST from your patch.  I won't make those mistakes again (like enumerated lists).

This applied and looks fine.

I assume you merged the necessary patches to make the functions in these examples work.  They did not work for me with a copy of 4.1.1.alpha1.  So doctests really ought to be run on this file just to make sure that the examples are correct.
