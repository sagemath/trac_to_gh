Just get rid of the SAGE_PARALLEL_DIST check here in `devel/sage/setup.py`:

```
        # See if we're trying out the experimental parallel build
        # code.
        if ncpus > 1 and os.environ.has_key('SAGE_PARALLEL_DIST'):
```

I think that's a race condition -- I suspect two calls to build_ext simultaneously realize that there's no directory to store a file and try to create it at the same time. The first is okay, but the second gets an error and bails.

The attached patch should fix this, as long as that's what's going on -- it creates all the appropriate directories in `build/` while processing files in serial, thereby eliminating the potential race problem.
