In the documentation for inverse_mod for (integral) elements of a number field says that the input may be "an ideal, or an element or list of elements generating a nonzero ideal" which is not true right now.

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(x^2 + 23)
sage: d = a + 3
sage: d.inverse_mod(a)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: ...
```

I fixed that and added an example in the doctest (patch based on 4.1.1)
