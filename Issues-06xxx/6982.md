New ATLAS package up at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/release/spkg/standard/atlas-3.8.3.p9.spkg

The changes from .p8 are:

* Remove the junk files `spkg-install~` and `SPKG.txt~`.
* Add the following line to `.hgignore`

 ```
 patches
 ```
 so that everything under the directory `patches/` would be ignored.
