This will make the tarball bigger (by 24MB), but is the only way to go at present.   With this one spkg update, building Sage 64-bit on OS X will be as simple as typing:

```
export SAGE64="yes"
make
```

```
should be changed to something like

```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL; tar -xjf $CUR/gfortran-4.2.3.tar.bz2 -C .
```
Also, there should be a message about the 64-bit version being installed: in the main spkg-install file, the function `install_fortran_osx64` could start with a message like

```
print "Installing OSX 64-bit gfortran compiler"
```
Some people who are sticklers might complain about the format of SPGK.txt, but I don't care that much.

Also taken care of. An updated spkg with reviewer changes can be found at

I'm reviewing the actual building of that package now. You're more than welcome to try building Sage 4.1.2.alpha2 from source with this updated Fortran package. The more the merrier :-)

This results in the following error:

The actual command should be 

```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL; tar -xjf $CUR/src/gfortran-4.2.3.tar.bz2 -C .
```
Notice the "src" part. The updated spkg includes this fix.
