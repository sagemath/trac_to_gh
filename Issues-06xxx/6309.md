First, I cached the graph() of a simplicial complex. These get very big and tedious to compute as the complexes get bigger.

I added the method clique_complex to the graph class. This returns the largest simplicial complex whose 1-skeleton is the given graph. Such simplicial complexes are called flag complexes.

I added is_flag_complex, is_connected, and remove_facet methods to the simplicial complex class.

The patch doesn't apply cleanly; does this depend on #6099?

The `remove_facet` method needs some doctests.  It also seems to have a line using self.facets, not self.facets().  Would it in fact make sense to just combine this with `remove_face`?  That is, rewrite `remove_face`: first check if the face being removed is a facet, in which case use your code.  Otherwise, use the old, presumably slower, code. I don't think we need two separate methods.  And before removing it, you should probably check that it's actually a facet: make sure it's not a face of any other facet.

Similarly, the `is_connected` method might fail if the complex was constructed with `maximality_check` False.

You might check your `is_connected` method for speed -- compare to this:

```
return self.graph().is_connected()
```
I expect that yours will be faster, even after the maximality check.  If you keep your code, you could put in a doctest like

```
sage: K = simplicial_complexes.RandomComplex(8,1)     [or some other simplicial complex]
sage: K.is_connected() == K.graph().is_connected()
True
```

It does not (shouldn't) rely on 6099. It applied cleanly for me to 4.0.2.rc1 once I created the second patch.

I agree with merging remove_facet() with remove_face(). And, I will try to make things robust with the maximality_check=False.

As for is_connected(), consider the following behavior:

```
sage: T = SimplicialComplex(5,[[1,2,3],[4]])
sage: T.graph().is_connected()
True
sage: T.is_connected()
False
```
Which should be correct?

```

Added a hopefully final patch: 6309-merged. This contains the above patches, and merges well on a fresh branch of 4.2.

The methods graph() and remove_face() now both work correctly. My method for is_connected() was completely wrong. So, for the moment, is_connected() calls graph().is_connected(). This will not give the correct answer for simplicial complexes created with maximal_check=False.

I also updated the changes to graphs/graph.py to reflect the depreciation of the cliques() method.
