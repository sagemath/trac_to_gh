I'm just asking to put this in experimental, so it doesn't need much review.  Just check that it is up to spec.   That's it.

I successfully built this on 4.0.1.  I'm not an expert on spkgs but there is an SPKG.txt which looks ok, the spkg-install script doesn't do anything bad that I could tell, and there is an hg repository.  So I see no reason why not to let this loose (watch those double negatives!) as an experimental spkg.
