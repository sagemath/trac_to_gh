**Attachment:** [trac_6735-spell-check-structure.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6735/trac_6735-spell-check-structure.patch.gz)

All these changes look good; as discussed on sage-devel, "Pyrex" should be changed to "Cython" but that is done on another ticket.  I tested the patch just to be safe, but as expected these changes don't cause any doctesting problems.
