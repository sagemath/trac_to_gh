This upgrades the group algebras to the current coercion system and fixes some issues of multiplication of group algebras A and B, satisfying A == B but not admitting coercion of elements.
This depends on #6669, which concerns homomorphisms from matrix group to other objects.

There's a lot of new code here, but it all looks good, and the doctests are fine too. 

Given the amount of category code that went into 4.3, we should make sure all tests pass when applied against that as well. (I tested against 4.2.)

I spent quite a while rebasing this to 4.5.alpha1. I will upload the rebased patch; but I was disappointed to find that there is still a serious issue that needs to be addressed.

The problem is that unpickling elements of group algebras created using the old code fails; you can't replace a class name with a function name and expect it to unpickle seamlessly. It ends up expecting `sage.algebras.group_algebra.GroupAlgebraElement` to be a class which can just be filled in with the pickled `__dict__` values, not a callable. This is what I get if I pickle a group algebra element without the patch, apply the patch and try to unpickle:

```

Some minor comments:

- The first line of the new file is redundant: "Group algebra of a group".  Maybe it should just be "Group algebras"?
- The new file should be added to the reference manual, by adding an appropriate line to `sage/doc/en/reference/algebras.rst`.

More interesting:

- Can you implement coercion from R[H] to R[G] if H is a subgroup of G, or more generally from R[H] to S[G] if there is a coercion from H to G and from R to S?  Then coercing from the base ring R to R[G] would just be the special case where R=S and H is the trivial group.

A more important issue: I'm not sure that I agree with the implementation.  I would have it inherit from `CombinatorialFreeModule`, and then unique representation is built in nicely so you don't have to cache the results as you do now.  You can also implement the Hopf algebra structure on the group algebra pretty easily.  For reference, you should look at the files

- `sage/categories/examples/hopf_algebras_with_basis.py` for a simple (not very full-featured) implementation of group algebras.

- `sage/algebras/steenrod/steenrod_algebra.py` for the implementation of the Steenrod algebra, including all of its Hopf algebra structure, inheriting from `CombinatorialFreeModule`.  This has a lot of things you don't need, but if you want to base the implementation on the first file, or if you want to modify the print representation of elements (which I recommend), you might be able to use this one to help fill in some details.

I attached a patch that changes the way functors are called.

Also I reviewed the parts that you implemented. That is, the transition to CombinatorialFreeModule. I would give this a positive review. So if you agree with the procedure that I described above and are fine with the rest of the code you can give this a positive review as a whole.
