It is possible to create FLINT `zmod_poly` objects whose coefficients are not reduced mod n (where n is the modulus). This is difficult to show directly in Sage, but here is an example symptom:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(15))
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(Integers(5))
sage: f = S(5*x)
sage: f
0
sage: f == 0
False
sage: f.degree()
1
```

Internally the coefficient 5 is not reduced, but it prints as reduced.

This bug is probably the main cause of #5817.

<a id='comment:4'></a>The patch applies against 4.0, and fixes the bug:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(Integers(15))
sage: S.<y> = PolynomialRing(Integers(5))
sage: f = S(5*x)
sage: f
0
sage: f == 0
True
sage: f.degree()
-1
```
Moreover, with this patch in, the spkg at #5817 passes all doctests. Positive review.
