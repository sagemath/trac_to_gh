It looks like you're using Sage 3.4.1. Would it be possible to try your script with a more recent version of Sage (like 4.1, the most recent as of now) and see whether you still get an error?

Importing individual modules without initializing sage by doing `import sage.all` is not supported. You should add a line with

```
import sage.all
```

at the beginning of your script.
