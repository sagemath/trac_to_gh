In the documentation for the Sturm bound, the following appears:

"Kevin Buzzard pointed out to me (William Stein) in Fall 2002 that the above bound is fine for Gamma1 with character, as one sees by taking a power of `f`. More precisely, if `fcong 0pmod{p}` for first `s` coefficients, then `f^r = 0 pmod{p}` for first `s r` coefficients. Since the weight of `f^r` is `r weight(f)`, it follows that if `s >=` the sturm bound for `Gamma_0` at weight(f), then `f^r` has valuation large enough to be forced to be `0` at `r *` weight(f) by Sturm bound (which is valid if we choose `r` right). Thus `f cong 0 pmod{p}`. Conclusion: For `Gamma_1` with fixed character, the Sturm bound is *exactly* the same as for           `Gamma_0`. "

However, this does not seem to be the case:

```
sage: CuspForms(DG144.1^2,3).sturm_bound()
3457
sage: CuspForms(Gamma0(144),3).sturm_bound()
73
```

I believe that this is due to the following code in the `sturm_bound` method for modular forms:

```
if M is not None:
            raise NotImplementedError
        if self.__sturm_bound is None:
            # the +1 below is because O(q^prec) has precision prec.
            self.__sturm_bound =      self.group().sturm_bound(self.weight())+1
        return self.__sturm_bound

```
where `self.group()' gives the wrong answer in the case of `Gamma_1` with fixed character, because it returns `Gamma_1` rather than `Gamma_0`.

I propose that the code above should be of the form

```
if M is not None:
            raise NotImplementedError
        if self.__sturm_bound is None:
            # the +1 below is because O(q^prec) has precision prec.
            G=self.group()
            if G=Gamma1(G.level()) and self.character() in DirichletGroup(self.level()):
                G=Gamma0(G.level())
            self.__sturm_bound = G.sturm_bound(self.weight())+1
        return self.__sturm_bound
```
before the sturm_bound variable is set, which would implement the remark of Buzzard given above.
