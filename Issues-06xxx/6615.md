It may take only two lines, but I do not know which ones (I got a bit lost reading graph_plot.py) and it may take half a second to who wrote it in the first place.

g=graphs.PetersenGraph()

g.plot(edge_colors={"red":[(0,1)]})

g.plot(vertex_colors={"red":[1]})

When you plot a graph and want some edges to have a different color, the first plot is perfect. In the second case, though, I think it would be better to assign the others vertices a default color ;-)

There was a small mistake in rgbcolor() where the hexcadecimal values were divided by 256 instead of 255 which lead to "red"!=(1,0,0).

All the colors were wrong and nobody noticed !! :-)

The edge color plot in the description works great.

The vertex color plot doesn't.  The specified vertex is red; the others disappeared!

Also, it would be great to include those two examples in the docs.
