The patches at #5954, #6037 and #6040 bring doctest coverage for quadratic forms up to 100%. In this patch series some functions were removed or renamed, so we should add compatibility functions.

These are the functions I propose we should handle:
- `count_modp__by_gauss_sum` renamed to `count_modp_solutions__by_Gauss_sum`.
- `count_local_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions`.
- `count_local_good_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__good_type`.
- `count_local_zero_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__zero_type`. 
- `count_local_bad_type` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type`. 
- `count_local_bad_typeI` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type_I`. 
- `count_local_bad_typeII` was renamed to `count_congruence_solutions__bad_type_II`.
- `GHY_mass_maximal` was renamed to `GHY_mass__maximal`.

Component: **quadratic forms**
