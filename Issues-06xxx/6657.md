I found the following to be rather unexpected:

EllipticCurve(GF(144169),j=1728)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x over Rational Field

[I understand that 1728 is considered an Integer, yet the first
argument seems to be ignored]

Easy to fix:  where EllipticCurve calls `EllipticCurve_from_j(j)` it should in fact coerce j into the parent of x (if x is not none).

This issue only appears in the deprecated function `EllipticCurve(..,j=..)`. The right function to call here is `EllipticCurve_from_j(GF(144169)(1728))`.

My proposal for a change is to finally eliminate the deprecated function.

Chris,

You are not quite right.  What is deprecated is EllipticCurve(j0), not EllipticCurve(j=j0):

```
sage: EllipticCurve(GF(101)(1728))
/home/john/sage-4.3.1.alpha1/local/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: 'EllipticCurve(j)' is deprecated; use 'EllipticCurve_from_j(j)' or 'EllipticCurve(j=j)' instead.
  #!/usr/bin/env python
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field of size 101
sage: EllipticCurve(j=GF(101)(1728))
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Finite Field of size 101
```
Now I cannot remember when that deprecation was put in, hence when it should be removed.

Anyway, Victor's point is a valid one, and I'll put up a patch!
