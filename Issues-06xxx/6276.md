Running on t2.math.washington.edu (a Sun T5240 running Solaris 10 update 4), the build of ATLAS fails when building sage-4.0.1.alpha0. (A sqlite bug was fixed first to allow Sage to start building ATLAS). Here's information about the build system. 

```

```

I did post this to sage-devel under the title "atlas-3.8.3.p2 failing on Solaris 10 with gcc-4.4.0" William Stein copied this to  Clint Whaley -- the main ATLAS developer.



Here's the last bit of the error. An almost full copy of all the output while building ATLAS is in the attached file - I removed 2500 or so lines showing the output from tar as the files were extracted.

<a id='comment:2'></a>
I've now developed a TEMPORARY fix for this, which needs a review. 

   Change GuessSmallNB() in src/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c
   as suggested by Clint Whaley to return 28
   on Solaris. This is ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX and once the real problem
   in the function is sorted out, this fix will need to be removed. But
   for now it permits ATLAS to build on a Sun T5240 with gcc-4.4.0.

Apart from the comments, the only change to the C source code is to add

```
return(28);
```
at the top of the function GuessSmallNB(). This fix is only implemented on Solaris, as the spkg-install now includes:

```
import shutil
if os.uname()[0] == 'SunOS':
   shutil.copy2('patches/mmsearch-with-temp-Solaris-fix.c','src/tune/blas/gemm/mmsearch.c')
```


With this patch applied, ATLAS builds on Solaris, with the next Solaris failure being in 'linbox'. 

Once an ATLAS developer is able to find the real reason for the failure, an update of the ATLAS source could should be implemented, which will mean we will mean this patch should be removed at a later date. 

Please see
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/Solaris-fixes/atlas/

I've NOT used 'hg' to commit this in any way (not even sure if I'm supposed to do that or the reviewer), so can the reviewer please do this for me. 

Dave

If ATLAS doesn't have pretuning information about a given machine it takes hours and hours.  When it does have that tuning information cached, it takes about 15 minutes.   There is a database of pretuning info included in the ATLAS spkg.  We have to figure out how to include t2's tuning info. 

I did start this build, so hopefully I can give this a positive review in hours and hours :-)
