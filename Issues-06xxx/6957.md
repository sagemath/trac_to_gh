This appears to be a duplicate directory tree.

The other places where there are javascript files appear to not share any files.

I just tried moving $SAGE_DATA/extcode/javascript/jsmath from a sage 4.1.1 binary downloaded from a mirror, and the notebook appears to runs just fine.

If this is really a duplicate, it can reduce a sage install by around 18Mb.
