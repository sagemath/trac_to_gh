Patch overview:

`elementwise_product()` in `matrix2.pyx` checks inputs for proper sizes, and coerces base rings, etc.

Then two versions of `_elementwise_product()` (in `matrix_dense.pyx` and `matrix_sparse.pyx`) take over and do the actual work in what should be a fairly efficient manner, given the generality implied.  

More efficient implementations are certainly possible for more specialized classes.  The intent here is to begin with a correct and general implementation that is moderately efficient, primarily to make the functionality available in Sage.
