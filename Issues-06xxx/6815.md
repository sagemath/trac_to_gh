Restarting worksheet seems to disable latex typesetting even though "Typeset" box is checked. If I un-check and then re-check the "Typeset" box, it starts working again.

Either I don't understand the problem, or I'm not having it.  What Sage version, browser, and OS?

Here's what I did (Sage 4.1.1 on a Mac (Intel, OS X 10.5) with Safari or Firefox):  I start a worksheet, click the Typeset box, then do some stuff.

Then I can (a) close the worksheet window, (b) click the "Save & quit" button then close it, or (c) quit Sage, leaving the window open.  After doing (a) or (b) and re-opening the worksheet, or doing (c) and running 'sage -notebook', then when I evaluate a cell in the worksheet, latex typesetting is still active.

I am having this issue with Sage-4.1.1 in Ubuntu 9.04 (Thinkpad x61-tablet) with both 
Firefox/Google Chrome. I guess, you might see this issue if you restart the worksheet 
(Action-->Restart Worksheet).
