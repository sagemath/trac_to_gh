Patch adds sqrtrem (I only found an existing isqrt) and a method to count trailing zero bits, both of which are needed to make mpmath on top of sage.Integer reasonably fast.

The value of (0).trailing_zero_bits() (as well as the name of the method) could be adjusted.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/6080
