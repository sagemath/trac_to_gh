```
After the patch, Dynkin diagram ascii art is available for reducible Cartan types.

```
sage: DynkinDiagram("F4xA2")

O---O=>=O---O
1   2   3   4
O---O
5   6
F4xA2

sage: CartanType("B2xC2").dynkin_diagram()

O=>=O
1   2
O=<=O
3   4
B2xC2
```

The patch `trac_6050.patch` goes on top of `trac_5502-revised.patch` but that has been merged in sage-4.0rc0.

The second patch `trac_6050-1.patch` corrects a minor misformatting in Type D extended ascii art.
