The new version should work in FF 3/3.5.  Nearly all of the changes are cosmetic.  See the code for details.  I didn't address the problems with iframes, since it's likely we'll go with another approach.

For what it's worth, I've attached an [example](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6460/graphed_ext.tbz2) that launches Rado's graph editor in a new, potentially reusable window, from a notebook cell.  Suggested directions:

* Put `graphed_ext.html` and `processing.editor.min.js` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript/`.  I haven't edited the enclosed [Processing](http://processingjs.org/reference) library, but it may be different from Rado's latest.
* Load `graphed.txt` as a worksheet.  The serialization code is from Rado's recent post about his elegant inline editor for the notebook.
* Try, e.g., `g = graphs.CubeGraph(4)`, followed by `graph_editor(g, 'g_mod')`, say.  A pop-up blocker may complain.  I just allowed pop-ups from `localhost`.
* See, e.g., [this link](http://www.w3schools.com/HTMLDOM/met_win_open.asp) for various window options.  To open the editor in a tab, check the browser settings for overrides and use `var win = window.open(url, name);` with the appropriate `url` and some `name`.  Different names will yield separate windows (or tabs).  The browser's security policy may prevent some actions, e.g., re-establishing client-side connections to reloaded parent worksheets.

It may be better to make some server-side changes.  Again, this is just an example.

A possible extension is the ability to keep a list of graphs in the new window and edit and export them in a random-access fashion --- a graph browser, perhaps.  Another is sharing an editor among multiple open worksheets.  The work on tearing out docstrings is somewhat related (cf. #6001).

Feel free to ask questions and make suggestions, though I'm a bit JavaScripted out just now...

The proper ticket for an interactive graph editor in Sage is actually #1321.  Sorry!
