The new version should work in FF 3/3.5.  Nearly all of the changes are cosmetic.  See the code for details.  I didn't address the problems with iframes, since it's likely we'll go with another approach.

For what it's worth, I've attached an [example](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6460/graphed_ext.tbz2.gz) that launches Rado's graph editor in a new, potentially reusable window, from a notebook cell.  Suggested directions:

* Put `graphed_ext.html` and `processing.editor.min.js` in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/notebook/javascript/`.  I haven't edited the enclosed [Processing](http://processingjs.org/reference) library, but it may be different from Rado's latest.

It may be better to make some server-side changes.  Again, this is just an example.

A possible extension is the ability to keep a list of graphs in the new window and edit and export them in a random-access fashion --- a graph browser, perhaps.  Another is sharing an editor among multiple open worksheets.  The work on tearing out docstrings is somewhat related (cf. #6001).
