When sage-4.1.1.alpha0 was released (see http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/267a2cb90085536b?hl=en), the following problem was reported :

```
Same here on Fedora 10 and Fedora 11, 32 bit.

In addition both in a fresh install and in an upgrade:

sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/combinat/words/morphism.py"
