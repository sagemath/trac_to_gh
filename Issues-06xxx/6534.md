Why are we using a devious and roundabout algorithm to compute Jacobi sums using Gauss sums, which is actually many orders of magnitude slower than using the definition directly? I'm not joking here: for a pretty small prime, the obvious algorithm is more than 800 times as fast as the implementation we currently have.
