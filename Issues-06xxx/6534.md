I'm not joking here: for a pretty small prime, the obvious algorithm is more than 800 times as fast as the implementation we currently have.

Here are two patches. One is intended to be applied on top of the patch at #6393, and the other without it; both give identical results. (This is intended to future-proof this ticket in case #6393 gets merged before anyone gets around to reviewing this one.)

While I was at it, I couldn't resist doing some streamlining to dirichlet.py by using the `@cached_method` decorator, and fixing a non-ReSTified docstring for Kloosterman sums.

The third patch above fixes some formatting slips in the documentation. I also added a definition of the Jacobi sum to the docstring, since there wasn't one before. This should apply fine over either of the previous two patches.

All files in sage/modular test ok.

I must check out this cached_method trick, since it simplifies code a lot!
