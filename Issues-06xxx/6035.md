The attached patch adds an option "detect_poles" to the plot command,
which if True detects vertical asymptotes of the plotted function.

```
sage: plot(gamma(x), (x, -3, 4), detect_poles = True).show(ymin = -5, ymax = 5)
```

**Attachment:** [detect_poles.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6035/detect_poles.patch.gz)

This seems to work pretty well, and since its an optional argument I don't see it interfering with any existing code.  The added documentation looks good.
