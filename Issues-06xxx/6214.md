Not always, but it is possible; the following is from "Drini" on sage-support:

I was checking the new polytope commands
specifically a polytope in R^2   with points (a,b,c,d,e,f) such that

e+b>= c+d
e+c >= b+d
a+b+c+d+e+f =  31
(this is a polytope I had worked on before so I know it very well)

After several tries (documentation still sparse and incomplete) I
managed to cosntruct it.
Checked vertices:

P.vertices()
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 31], [31, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 31/2, 31/2, 0],
[0,
0, 31/2, 0, 31/2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 31, 0], [0, 31/2, 0, 0, 31/2, 0],
[0,
31/2, 31/2, 0, 0, 0]]

That's right, 7 vertices, the right ones (again this is a polytope I
knew before)

P.ambiend_dim()
6

P.dim()
6

!!!!!
======================================
The ambient dimension is indeed 6 (we're after all in R^6) but the
polytope has dimension 5 for it's contained in the a+b+c+d+e+f=31
hyperplane (and thus its dimension is 1 less than ambient) Notice all
vertices have coordinates adding 31, therefore it's indeed contained
in the hyperplane
Polymake verified this as well saying dimension is 5

Now I don't know how or where to submit a bug, but I suppose people
involved with development here know
so the least I can do is  comment there's a bug so it's known and
forwarded (and then stop doing polytope computations in sagemath for a
bit longer)

Unfortunately this is still incorrect even after #7109.

```
sage: pdata=[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,0],[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],[0,0, 1, -1, -1, 1, 0], [0, 0, -1, 1, -1, 1, 0], [-31, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],[31, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]] 
sage: p = Polyhedron(ieqs = DATA)
sage: p.dim()

```

But its really dimension 5.  If a second polyhedron is compute from the vertices of the one above, it will have the correct dimension.

```
sage: Polyhedron(ieqs=pdata).dim()

The original example also works as it should:

```
sage: positive_coords = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]])
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=positive_coords.inequalities() + [[0,0,1,-1,-1,1,0], [0,0,-1,1,-1,1,0]], eqns=[[-31,1,1,1,1,1,1]])
sage: P

```

I think it is a good example to add to the Polyhdedron documentation, patch is included.

The patch also adds a Polyhedron.contains(point) and Polyhedron.interior_contains(point) method, as that is probably a common use. Finally, I removed some spurious assignments to docstrings that overwrote previously-defined docstrings. 

I'm sorry for bunching patches together, but I think that the other changes are uncontroversial. If anybody feels strongly about that I can disentangle them.
