```
To replicate this on OS X:

1. export SAGE64="yes"
2. Try to build Sage, which will fail because of Fortran
3. install the experimental fortran spkg:

```
sage -i fortran-OSX64-20090120
```
4. fix ratpoints using the spkg in #6492
5. continue the build and get the following error.  Note that scipy used to work, for sage-4.0.  So something got messed up when we ugpraded scipy.

It turns out this is caused by a bug in numpy :-).    I commented out the not-needed line that is patched here http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1087 and the build completes fine.  So here is a new numpy spkg.  

With this package and the patched ratpoints, sage builds completely 64-bit on OS X.

I'm renaming this spkg to `numpy-1.3.0.p1.spkg` since there is already an spkg called `numpy-1.3.0.p0.spkg` in Sage 4.1. This is to prevent confusion later on: people might wonder why Sage 4.1 and (the upcoming) Sage 4.1.1 each has a numpy spkg with the same name as each other, but patched differently. The renamed spkg is up at
