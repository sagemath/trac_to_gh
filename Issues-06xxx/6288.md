For now you can at least start sage then type

sage: !ecl

to start ecl.  It appears to not make any use of ecl.  I don't know if this is just
a compilation problem or an ecl limitation.

The Sage <--> lisp interface already works fine:

sage: lisp.eval('(+ 2 3)')
'5'

I'm not sure why %gap works but not %lisp:

sage: %lisp
ERROR: Magic function `lisp` not found.
sage: %gap
  --> Switching to Gap <-- 
gap: 
```

<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

ok, here is a review patch.

First I have made some minor formatting changes (pep8)

Next, I have corrected the part handling the bad names

Here is the list of interfaces with bad names:

```
[('gp', 'pari', PARI/GP interpreter),
 ('lisp', 'Lisp', Lisp Interpreter),
 ('sage0', 'sage', Sage),
 ('mupad', 'MuPAD', Mupad),
 ('lie', 'LiE', LiE Interpreter)]
```
I would prefer to avoid having the magic command "%sage" !

I also wonder if it is necessary to deprecate the bad names, instead of just using them as an alternative ?
