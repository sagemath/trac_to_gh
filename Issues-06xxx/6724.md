With Sage 4.1.1.rc2, the only warnings I see when building the reference manual are:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/sage-4.1.1.rc2-sage.math/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph.py:docstring of sage.graphs.graph.GenericGraph.kirchhoff_matrix:56: (WARNING/2) Literal block ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

```
These warnings are fixed by #6684. So I applied patches against Sage 4.1.1.rc2 in this order:
1. the patch at #6684
2. the patch on this ticket
The reference manual then rebuilt without any warnings. So I'm curious where and how you got the warning you reported.

It was on sage4.1.1.rc2 + the two other spelling-tickets that you just closed #6723 and #6731.

This warning appeared in sage -docbuild reference html

and the table of contents of the html reference contained as the last entry of Modules

```
UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE
```

...

and I just did it again on a brand new clone from sage 4.1.1.rc2; importing only this patch; doing sage -b (which went all fine) and then sage -docbuild reference html gives me the same warning as before, namely

```
chrigu@linux-ljo8:~/sage/trac_spell> sage -docbuild reference html

Am I doing something wrong ?

Here I start again, outlining specific steps so that we are in sync on what's going on.
* I took the sage.math binary of Sage 4.1.1.rc2, uncompressed it and ran it:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage mvngu]$ pwd

 ```
* With this clean slate, the content of the file `modules.rst` should be as follows:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.rc2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux]$ cd devel/sage-main/
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cat doc/en/reference/modules.rst

 ```
* Now I merge the patches at #6723, #6731, and #6724 (in that order) using Mercurial queue:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6723/trac_6723-spell-check-modular.patch.gz && hg qpush

 applying trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch
 Now at: trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch
 ```
* The content of the file `modules.rst` should not and have not been changed because the patches at #6723, #6731, and #6724 don't touch that file at all. This file controls what goes into the section on modules of the the built reference manual.

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cat doc/en/reference/modules.rst

    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_element
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism
 ```
* I now rebuild those library files that have changed and then proceed to build the reference manual:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cd ../..

 <output messages>
 ```
* The only warnings I see are those relating to bad ReST formatting in `sage/graphs/graph.py`:

 ```

 ```
 But this can be resolved with the patch at #6684.
* If after following the steps above and you still get the same warnings you reported above, you might instead want to apply the patch `trac_6724-spell-check-modules-reduced.patch`. It's a reduced version of the patch `trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch` with the following hunk removed:
