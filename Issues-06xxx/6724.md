With Sage 4.1.1.rc2, the only warnings I see when building the reference manual are:

```

```
These warnings are fixed by #6684. So I applied patches against Sage 4.1.1.rc2 in this order:
1. the patch at #6684
2. the patch on this ticket
The reference manual then rebuilt without any warnings. So I'm curious where and how you got the warning you reported.

It was on sage4.1.1.rc2 + the two other spelling-tickets that you just closed #6723 and #6731.

This warning appeared in sage -docbuild reference html

and the table of contents of the html reference contained as the last entry of Modules

```
UNABLE TO IMPORT MODULE
```

...

and I just did it again on a brand new clone from sage 4.1.1.rc2; importing only this patch; doing sage -b (which went all fine) and then sage -docbuild reference html gives me the same warning as before, namely

```
chrigu@linux-ljo8:~/sage/trac_spell> sage -docbuild reference html

Am I doing something wrong ?

 <more output messages>
 ```
* With this clean slate, the content of the file `modules.rst` should be as follows:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.rc2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux]$ cd devel/sage-main/
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cat doc/en/reference/modules.rst

 Modules

 .. toctree::

    sage/modules/module
    sage/modules/free_module
    sage/modules/free_module_element
 
    sage/modules/complex_double_vector
    sage/modules/real_double_vector

    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_element
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism
 ```
* Now I merge the patches at #6723, #6731, and #6724 (in that order) using Mercurial queue:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6723/trac_6723-spell-check-modular.patch && hg qpush
 adding trac_6723-spell-check-modular.patch to series file
 applying trac_6723-spell-check-modular.patch
 Now at: trac_6723-spell-check-modular.patch
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6731/trac_6731-spell-check-schemes.patch && hg qpush
 adding trac_6731-spell-check-schemes.patch to series file
 applying trac_6731-spell-check-schemes.patch
 Now at: trac_6731-spell-check-schemes.patch
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6724/trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch && hg qpush
 adding trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch to series file
 applying trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch
 Now at: trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch
 ```
* The content of the file `modules.rst` should not and have not been changed because the patches at #6723, #6731, and #6724 don't touch that file at all. This file controls what goes into the section on modules of the the built reference manual.

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cat doc/en/reference/modules.rst 
 .. _ch:modules:

    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_module
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_element
    sage/modules/fg_pid/fgp_morphism
 ```
* I now rebuild those library files that have changed and then proceed to build the reference manual:

 ```
 [mvngu@sage sage-main]$ cd ../..
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.rc2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux]$ ./sage -b main
 <compiler messages>
 [mvngu@sage sage-4.1.1.rc2-sage.math.washington.edu-x86_64-Linux]$ ./sage -docbuild reference html
 <output messages>
 ```
* The only warnings I see are those relating to bad ReST formatting in `sage/graphs/graph.py`:

 ```

 ```
 But this can be resolved with the patch at #6684.
* If after following the steps above and you still get the same warnings you reported above, you might instead want to apply the patch `trac_6724-spell-check-modules-reduced.patch`. It's a reduced version of the patch `trac_6724-spell-check-modules.patch` with the following hunk removed:

Sorry, I noticed only now, that I have the same problem in without the patch. Everything looks like in your case except that the title of the file is changed.... I will download from scratch and see if I can get it to work.

Since I won't object any more if someone else gives a positive review I change the summary back; maybe someone else will be faster than me.
