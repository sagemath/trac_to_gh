There is another bug in blocks_and_cut_vertices() where cut vertices can appear more than once in the returned list of cut vertices.  Jason Grout pointed out this problem in ticket [#6632](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6632#comment:5).

```
sage: graphs.StarGraph(3).blocks_and_cut_vertices()
([[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 0]], [0, 0, 0])
```

The problem occurs because the list C of cut vertices should be treated as a set, not a list: membership should be tested before adding a vertex to the list.

Following a suggestion of Jason's, I also changed the initialization of the parent array to None.

Patch will be attached below.
