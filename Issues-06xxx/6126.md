The error is observed on my linux box as well as sage.math.washington.edu (my version is 3.4.1, sage.math version is 3.4.2, the error is the same).  The error is in the function "jucys_murphy".

```
sage: G=SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ,5)
sage: PermutationOptions(mult='l2r', display='cycle')
sage: for i in range(2,6):
....: G.jucys_murphy(i)
....:
(1,2)
(2,3) + (1,2)
(3,4) + (2,3) + (1,2)
(4,5) + (3,4) + (2,3) + (1,2)
```
I believe the returned elements should be

```
(1,2)
(2,3) + (1,3)
(3,4) + (2,4) + (1,4)
(4,5) + (3,5) + (2,5) + (1,5)
```
I found the relevant code.  On both machines the offending code is in

/usr/local/sage/devel/sage-main/build/sage/combinat/symmetric_group_algebra.py,

and

/usr/local/sage/devel/sage-main/sage/combinat).  I have fixed on my machine by changing in those files the lines 180-185 from

```
------------
for i in range(1, k):
p = range(1, self.n+1)
p[i-1] = i+1
p[i] = i
res += self(p)
return res
----------------
```

to

```
------------
for i in range(1, k):
p = range(1, self.n+1)
+ p[i-1] = k
+ p[k-1] = i
res += self(p)
return res
----------------
```
