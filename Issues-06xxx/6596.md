The attached patch factors out some commonly called code for dealing with libsingular to make it more accessible.

Also, the attached patch wraps Singular's Gröbner strategy objects which allow much faster normal form computations.

Groebner Strategy in action

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,6,'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: J = Ideal(I.groebner_basis())
sage: J.ngens()
45
```

```
sage: f = P.random_element()
```

The usual call to `kNF`:

```
sage: %timeit f.reduce(J.gens())
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
```

Using the `GroebnerStrategy` object.

```
sage: %timeit J.reduce(f)
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.37 µs per loop
```
