Groebner Strategy in action

```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,6,'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: J = Ideal(I.groebner_basis())
sage: J.ngens()
45
```

```
sage: f = P.random_element()
```

The usual call to `kNF`:

```
sage: %timeit f.reduce(J.gens())
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.11 ms per loop
```

Using the `GroebnerStrategy` object.

```
sage: %timeit J.reduce(f)
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.37 µs per loop
```
