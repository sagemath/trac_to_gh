Build the HTML documentation, including the website, and navigate to `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/index.html`.  Clicking on a link to an  individual document yields a directory listing, instead of the expected index page.

The patch fixes the index.html linking problem, but only for the page

SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/index.html

There's also a "website" which can be built using

sage -docbuild website html

and the same problem is still with the page

SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/website/index.html

But I doubt we need "website" at all. Its purpose is to link to the other 8 standard documents. This is already achieved with

SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/index.html

So I'm closing this ticket as fixing the linking problem in the page 

SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/index.html

Feel free to open another ticket to fix or delete the "website" page.

I think `sage -docbuild website html` builds the top-level `index.html` in `website/` and just copies the output up one directory level.  (We could delete the original afterward.)  Perhaps I should have put "web site" in the summary instead of "website."  I apologize, if I'm mistaken.
