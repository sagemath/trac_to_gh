More clearly, here's the "bug" part of this.  The documentation says that the function takes a symbolic function, but clearly does not:

```
sage: f(x,y) = (100 - x) + (1000 - y)
sage: c = x + y - 479 
sage: minimize_constrained(f,[c],[100,300])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
