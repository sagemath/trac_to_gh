Sage-4.0 has tons  (nearly 100) of objects with doctests that create pickles, which aren't in the pickle jar right now (in sage-3.4.2).  
The attached new pickle *adds* all these 100 pickles to the existing pickle jar, and deletes a few from calculus that are no longer supported.  This depends on the pynac switch for the new symbolic pickles to work. 

The patch is here:
