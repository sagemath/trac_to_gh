```
In new symbolics, underlying "sage.symbolic.function.SFunction" class allows one to pass the keywords such as "latex_name=LaTeX". It would be really good if we expose this feature at the user interface level. This will directly allow LaTeX customization by users according to their need.

Currently, Sage (4.0.1) raises error if one tries to do so.


Couple of example usage:

**(1)** Define symbolic function with its latex representaion

```
riemann(x) = function('riemann', x, latex_name="\\mathcal{R}")
latex( riemann(x) )
\mathcal{R}\left(x\right)
```


**(2)**   Printing arguments of a symbolic functions as its indices.

```
mu,nu = var('mu,nu')
def my_latex_print(*args): 
    return "\psi_{%s}"%(', '.join(map(latex, args)))

psi(mu,nu) = function('psi', mu,nu, print_latex_func=my_latex_print)

latex(psi(mu,nu))
\psi_{\mu, \nu}
```


Attached patch allows keyword arguments while defining symbolic functions.

Would something similar be possible whenever a variable is defined?
E.g. if I want to use multiple subscripts, I would like to define

That would make it really flexible.
