1.  I still get 12 optional doctest failures, it looks like the requested dates are not being honored, but I haven't deduced a pattern to it.  Full output in attached text file.

2.  Documentation can be built with a lot fewer blank lines, especially inbetween list elements.  Reviewer patch illustrates this and corrects one misspelled word.

3.  I couldn't test the documentation since it doesn't seem to get pulled into the reference manual.  Should it be included?  If not, how should it be tested?

It looks like Minh fixed the documentation in `sage/finance` with [attachment: trac_9218-reviewer.patch:ticket:9218](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6334/1601d95241f0887001f45926f86ba742.gz).

There is also #13884 to fix the optional doctests, where Karl-Dieter posted a patch.

Shall we close this ticket as duplicate?
