1.  I still get 12 optional doctest failures, it looks like the requested dates are not being honored, but I haven't deduced a pattern to it.  Full output in attached text file.

2.  Documentation can be built with a lot fewer blank lines, especially inbetween list elements.  Reviewer patch illustrates this and corrects one misspelled word.

3.  I couldn't test the documentation since it doesn't seem to get pulled into the reference manual.  Should it be included?  If not, how should it be tested?

Attachment: **[trac_6334_reviewer_edits.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6334/trac_6334_reviewer_edits.patch.gz)**

It looks like Minh fixed the documentation in `sage/finance` with [attachment: trac_9218-reviewer.patch:ticket:9218](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6334/1601d95241f0887001f45926f86ba742.gz).

There is also #13884 to fix the optional doctests, where Karl-Dieter posted a patch.

Shall we close this ticket as duplicate?
