This is an error which occurs if one tries to construct coercing from a matrix group into an algebra. The current implementation of homomorphisms with domain a matrix group require the codomain to be a matrix group, too.

This looks good, applies cleanly and passes long tests under sage-4.2.  I will test on sage-4.2.1 as soon as sage.math binaries are available.

One thing needs to be fixed: please add some doctests with examples of homomorphisms between matrix groups, and from matrix groups to other types of groups.  (I do realise that the method patched here did not have doctests to start with.)
