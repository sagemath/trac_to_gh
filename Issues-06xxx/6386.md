The elliptic exponential is the inverse to the elliptic log, i.e. it is the Weierstrass parametrization CC/L -> E(CC) for an elliptic curve.

The patch implements this as a member function of the PeriodLattice_ell class.  It works for all period lattices, real or not.  Currently it is accessible via a member function for elliptic curves over Q;  I'll make it work over number fields too, but ona separate ticket.  [At present it would already work for real embeddings;  shortly a rigorously justified elliptic log for non-real embeddings will also be ready.]

The hard work is done by pari's ellwp0() function, which was already wrapped, but to get the precision right that had to be slightly changed.

For the most part this looks good, and specifically I wasn't able to find any precision issues. 

* I think the elliptic exponential should actually return a point on E(C), not just a tuple (x,y)

* The docstring in elliptic exponential about to_Weierstrass is wrong. (Maybe it could be to_curve, default True to give something on E(C), false returning the raw `(wp(z), wp'(z))`.

* The `antilogarithm` shouldn't simply discard the imaginary part: 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('389a')
sage: z0 = CC(1.76776906963, 0.303020775118)
sage: E.elliptic_exponential(z0)
(1.00012725137998 + 1.00002216580174*I,
 0.000229106700941339 + 2.00010160734906*I)
sage: E.antilogarithm(z0, 10)
(1 : 0 : 1)

OK, I'll do that.  I literally had not tried that!

I'll check that out.

My reasoning is that you only use this function when you have reason to believe that the result is actually a rational point, so in particular it is real.  Can I just clarify the docstring?  Note that this function is never going to be able to give a provable result, at best it will retrun a rational point whose elliptic log is close to the input value, but it is still a useful thing to have.
