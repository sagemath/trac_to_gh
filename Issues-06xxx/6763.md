This patch implements a solver for the Bin Packing problem using Linear Programming.. To test this you will have to first install GLPK and one patch, all available on ticket #6869 ;-)

I hope you will like the documentation, I tried to make it clean ;-)

As the functions dealing with LP have not been reviewed, I prefer to rewrite the MIP class for Sage to make it easier to use. I will post a new version of the MIP patch as soon as possible, along with all the patches for functions using it.

Sorry for the trouble, I'll try to make it quick !
