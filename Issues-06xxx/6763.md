As the functions dealing with LP have not been reviewed, I prefer to rewrite the MIP class for Sage to make it easier to use. I will post a new version of the MIP patch as soon as possible, along with all the patches for functions using it.

Sorry for the trouble, I'll try to make it quick !

**Attachment:** [binpacking.patch](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6763/binpacking.patch)

I think check should be added to make sure all weights are <= max. At the moment

```
binpacking([1,2,3],2)
```
causes infinite loop. Otherwise code seems fine.

Patch updated !! With a few other modifications, as this patch is one of the first LP patches Trac received, and is even older than the 8 months this ticket indicates... I'm not sorry to see it finally reviewed ! :-)

By the way, if you like Linear Programming and have some time to spend on trac tickets... I desperately need some help with LP patches in the Graph Theory section ;-)

Thank you very much !
