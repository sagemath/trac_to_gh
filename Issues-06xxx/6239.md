This is a follow up to #6093. The patch on that ticket adds documentation to the pydesign module ext_rep. However, some of the formatting of the docstrings doesn't follow ReST formatting, hence doesn't show up nicely in the HTML and PDF versions. The module `sage/combinat/designs/ext_rep.py` should also be added to the reference manual.
