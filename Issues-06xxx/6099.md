It looks very good, but there are a few issues:\n\n- in the docstring for effective_vertices, you might mention that it returns a Simplex.

I can imagine someone wanting to use the domain of the fiber product, for example, but they won't see the `_domain` attribute on tab completion.\n\n- You don't have 100% documentation and doctest coverage.

<a id='comment:3'></a>It's great that you're working on this.  It looks very good, but there are a few issues:

- in the docstring for effective_vertices, you might mention that it returns a Simplex.  The docstring could start "The set of vertices belonging to some face, as a simplex", and you could also put in a doctest like

```
sage: type(S.effective_vertices())
<class 'sage.homology.simplicial_complex.Simplex'>
```

- I had a few doctest failures which I think are fixed in #6309 (two extra periods), but they should be fixed here.

- Is it a good idea to have `domain` and `codomain` methods for morphisms?  I can imagine someone wanting to use the domain of the fiber product, for example, but they won't see the `_domain` attribute on tab completion.

- You don't have 100% documentation and doctest coverage.  Type 'sage -coverage ...insert_path_here.../sage/homology' to get a summary.  When you do this, note that messages like
 {{{
 Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
* _repr_(self):
 }}}
 can be avoided if you add "# indirect doctest", like this:
 {{{
            sage: x = i.associated_chain_complex_morphism()
            sage: x # indirect doctest
 }}}

- Should "product" be renamed "fiber_product" so it's less ambiguous?

- I wonder if `ChainComplexMorphism` should inherit from `ModuleElement` rather than `SageObject`.

    Hi Benjamin,

Sorry for the conflict. Rebasing the patch should be fairly easy. I suspect that the change to category_types can simply be discarded. As for the change in homset.py: I have removed this ugly run time type checking there. Instead, Hom(X, Y) looks for a method X._Hom_, and calls it if it exists. This _Hom_ method could typically be implemented in ChainComplexes.ParentMethods to achieve the current effect.

Good luck, and feel free to bug me.

Indeed.

`ChainComplexes.ParentMethods` is the class in the `ChainComplexes` category containing the generic code that applies to all parents in this category. That could be useful later on if there is more than one implementation of such parents. No rush for now.

At first sight, it should work smoothly.

For the record: in the new category code, when a category is passed as optional argument, it's done as `category=...` rather than `cat=...`. I just checked, and this should not be an issue for _Hom_. You may want to change this for consistency though, now or later.
