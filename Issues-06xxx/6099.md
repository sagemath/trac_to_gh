It's great that you're working on this.  It looks very good, but there are a few issues:

- in the docstring for effective_vertices, you might mention that it returns a Simplex.  The docstring could start "The set of vertices belonging to some face, as a simplex", and you could also put in a doctest like

```
sage: type(S.effective_vertices())
<class 'sage.homology.simplicial_complex.Simplex'>
```

- I had a few doctest failures which I think are fixed in #6309 (two extra periods), but they should be fixed here.

- Is it a good idea to have `domain` and `codomain` methods for morphisms?  I can imagine someone wanting to use the domain of the fiber product, for example, but they won't see the `_domain` attribute on tab completion.

- You don't have 100% documentation and doctest coverage.  Type 'sage -coverage ...insert_path_here.../sage/homology' to get a summary.  When you do this, note that messages like

 ```
 Possibly wrong (function name doesn't occur in doctests):
	 * _repr_(self):
 ```
 can be avoided if you add "# indirect doctest", like this:

 ```
            sage: x = i.associated_chain_complex_morphism()
            sage: x # indirect doctest
 ```

- Should "product" be renamed "fiber_product" so it's less ambiguous?

- I wonder if `ChainComplexMorphism` should inherit from `ModuleElement` rather than `SageObject`.  Then you would define a method `_mul_` (rather than `__mul__`), and similarly for `_add_`, and you could also define `_lmul_` and `_rmul_` to deal with scalar multiplication.  Check the Sage reference manual, the "Coercion" section.  (This section is newly added to the reference manual, as of Sage 4.0.1 or 4.0.2, I think.)

- I'm attaching a small patch which adds the new files to the reference manual.  (This involves editing one file, doc/en/reference/homology.rst, and also because of the way reST works, I had to change 

 ``` 
 - D. Benjamin Antieau <d.ben.antieau@gmail.com> (2009.06)
 ```
 to 

 ```
 - \D. Benjamin Antieau <d.ben.antieau@gmail.com> (2009.06)
 ```
 (The "D." at essentially the beginning of the line seemed to tell Sphinx that this was part of a numbered list, starting with number 4.)  Feel free to incorporate my changes and produce one single patch which does everything here.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:5\" align=\"right\">comment:5</div>\n\nThis is almost done.  I'm attaching a patch making a few changes.  First, in homology.rst, it should say `sage/homology/chain_complex_homspace` (it has \"homset\" instead of \"homspace\").  Also, I think that in category_types.py, the entry for chain complexes should say:\n\n```\n    ChainComplexes         : [RingModules, AbelianGroups, Sets],\\\n```\nAlso, I've changed the `__mul__` method for maps of chain complexes so that when the right-hand factor is a ring element, it gets multiplied on the right, not the left (in case we ever work over noncommutative rings).  I've also added an `__rmul__` method for multiplying on the left by a ring element.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This is almost done.  I'm attaching a patch making a few changes.  First, in homology.rst, it should say `sage/homology/chain_complex_homspace` (it has "homset" instead of "homspace").  Also, I think that in category_types.py, the entry for chain complexes should say:

```
    ChainComplexes         : [RingModules, AbelianGroups, Sets],\
```
Also, I've changed the `__mul__` method for maps of chain complexes so that when the right-hand factor is a ring element, it gets multiplied on the right, not the left (in case we ever work over noncommutative rings).  I've also added an `__rmul__` method for multiplying on the left by a ring element.  I changed the string representation for chain complexes so it doesn't have a period at the end, so that your string representations for chain maps look better.

Finally, the only major problem: my patch fixes an issue with converting maps of simplicial complexes to maps of chain complexes:

```
sage: X = SimplicialComplex(1, [[0,1]]); X
Simplicial complex with vertex set (0, 1) and facets {(0, 1)}
sage: H = Hom(X, X)
sage: f = H({0:1, 1:0})
sage: f.associated_chain_complex_morphism()

The issue is orientation: in the line

```
                    mval[X_faces.index(i)+(Y_faces.index(y)*num_faces_X)] = 1
```
in `associated_chain_complex_morphism`, the right side should be 1 or -1, depending on the orientation of y.

Indeed.

`ChainComplexes.ParentMethods` is the class in the `ChainComplexes` category containing the generic code that applies to all parents in this category. That could be useful later on if there is more than one implementation of such parents. No rush for now.

I just looked at those, and this sounds good. I am setting the positive review back. Thanks!

At first sight, it should work smoothly.

For the record: in the new category code, when a category is passed as optional argument, it's done as `category=...` rather than `cat=...`. I just checked, and this should not be an issue for _Hom_. You may want to change this for consistency though, now or later.
