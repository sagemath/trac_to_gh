In Python 3, "greater than" etc. comparisons between objects where no natural ordering exist are supposed to raise a "TypeError"

Already, comparing complex numbers in Python 2.6.2 raises
`TypeError: no ordering relation is defined for complex numbers`

Changing this will probably lead to even more doctest failures, but brings us closer to Python's way of doing things and to mathematical sanity.
