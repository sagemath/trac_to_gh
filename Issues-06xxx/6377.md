<a id='comment:4'></a>Hi Burcin,

I tested this out. It looks fine to me. 

I guess, it would be good if we could follow some standard convention for 
values of these functions at their poles, brunch cuts. For example, following 
looks odd to me

```
sage: arctan(-Infinity)
-1/2*pi
sage: tan(-pi/2)
Infinity
```

May be we should discuss this in sage-devel for adopting a convention for
these special values.

There are some other issues that would need future work. For example, you have
fixed values of log at 0

```
sage: SR(0).log()
-Infinity
```

However, following still raises error

```
sage: log(0)
ValueError ...
```

In any case, this patch fixes lot of issues and should be included.
The remaining issues should be fixed later. I am going to give a positive
review shortly.
