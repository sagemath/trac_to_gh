From [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_frm/thread/b3e57f934ee83c79):

```
I just noticed an old thread, where a user had problems on squite, 
making his own version of some packages with an alpha, heta or rc 
release of Sage. 

It would be good if alpha/beta/rc releases always showed a message that 
they were pre-release versions for developers and not considered stable. 
If there was some automatic way of making this happen, it would avoid 
the risk of someone forgetting to add or delete a file. 
```
This patch should do this.  To fully test, make a source distribution of Sage using sage-sdist.  To partially test, in Sage, do

```
sage: sage.version.version
'4.1.rc1'
sage: print sage.misc.banner.banner_text()
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1.rc1, Release Date: 2009-07-07                     |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |

* Warning: this is a prerelease version, and it may be unstable.     *
*                                                                    *

sage: sage.version.version = '4.1'
sage: print sage.misc.banner.banner_text()
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Sage Version 4.1, Release Date: 2009-07-07                         |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
I believe that when a Sage distribution is created, the string from `banner_text()` is printed into the file SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-banner (see SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage-sdist).  So I think this patch will do what was requested.

This patch looks good, but I did try to use `-sdist` and am having some problems. I'm not sure if the problem is with the patch or with my use of -sdist. (Almost certainly the latter!)

I compiled a source tarball (4.1.rc1), applied the patch (with mq), did a qfinish to get the patch into the regular history, and then tried `./sage -sdist 4.1.rc2` to try and make a fictional rc2 to see if, after compiling, I got the correct banner.

The sdist script spit out some strange errors, but did create a tarball. I'm compiling that tarball now, but local/bin/sage-banner is an empty file!

Also, doing an sdist leaves behind a zombie tree: it looks like it's there, but if you try to run Sage, it doesn't work. This is because of #1065 (!) but even if I do a `sage -b`, when I rerun Sage, I don't get a banner...which is worrisome since that's what this ticket is about.

I do notice that when I try to emulate the `sage-sdist` script and run the line that sets the banner, this happens. This is from a "`sage -sh`" shell:

```

Looks like something fishy in the bit of code that makes the version dictionary. I'll look at this more later, if no one beats to me. BTW, this did pass doctests, so either something is really goofy about the environment above, or we a fix and a new doctest.
