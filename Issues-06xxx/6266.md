# Issue 6266: Build problem of sqlite on Solaris 10 with gcc 4.4.0

The sqlite in Sage 4.0.1-alpha0 (sqlite-3.5.3.p3) fails to build on t2, which runs Solaris 10 update 4, if gcc 4.4.0 is used as the compiler. Error messages are:

```
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `write@SUNW_0.9'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `pthread_create@SUNW_0.9'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `fcntl@SUNW_0.9'

./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `pthread_self@SUNW_0.9'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `fsync@SUNW_0.9'
```
I've downloaded both sqlite 3.5.3 and the latest (3.6.14.2) and find the build fails with similar (but fewer) error messages to those in Sage, so I don't  believe updating to the latest sqlite will solve this. The error messages building the latest sqlite are:

```

./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `dlerror@SUNW_1.22'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `dlopen@SUNW_1.22'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `dlsym@SUNW_1.22'
./.libs/libsqlite3.so: undefined reference to `dlclose@SUNW_1.22'
```

A search of the web shows the sort of error messages have existed a long time in lots of software, going as far back as at least 2005. The culprit is often indicated to be libtool. 

The developers of sqlite appear to be using a 3-year old version of libtool (1.5.24). 

I've downloaded that old version of libtool and found it fails 4 self-tests on t2. The latest version of libtool fails one test, suggesting sqlite would have more chance of working on Solaris if its developers used a later version of libtool. 

If it's possible to get the developers of sqlite to use a later version of libtool, then an update of sqlite might be sensible, but at present it will not achieve anything very useful for Solaris. I'm in the process of trying to get this fixed.

I've now fixed this. The problem was related to linking both libpthread and libc in the wrong order, due to what is probably a bug in libtool. 

Nicolas Williams  (Nicolas.Williams`@`sun.com) has pointed out to me that there is no longer any need to link libpthread, as its functionality has been moved to libc. 

The following code simply stops libpthread being linked. I've put the revised SPKG.txt and spkg-install at the following (there's also another .spkg file).

This looks good, but I do have a comment about SPKG.txt: the stars are for an itemized list, so you just need one star for a single list item:

```

 * Fixed a bug that prevented sqlite building on the Sun T5240
 t2.math.washington.edu running Solaris 10 update 4 with gcc version 4.4.0.
 
 Linking libpthread before libc caused the problem. Changing the 
 order of linking avoided it, but is not easy to do, as the 
 order is determined by libtool. 
 However, libpthread is not necessary on Solaris 10. 
 There is *probably* a libtool bug that is the real cause. 
 The bug fix is implemented by striping libpthread out of the 
 Makefile with sed. 
 
 Thanks are due to Nicolas Williams (Nicolas.Williams@sun.com)
 who made me aware libpthread was not necessary, as its functionality
 was moved to libc in Solaris 10, with libpthread
 only provided for backwards compatibility. 
```
It also seems necessary to line up all the text below the star to get it all put into one item.

"has them ci'd into the .hg repo" means "has them committed into the Mercurial repository". I'm not sure how much you know about revision control software, but the idea is to record ("commit") the changes you've made. In the spkg I linked to above, I did that.

When you're working on spkgs (patches, spkg-install, etc), the algorithm is more or less:

* make your changes
* increment the "p number" (here, 3.5.3.p3 -> 3.5.3.p4)
* document them in SPKG.txt
* do "hg commit" to commit the changes
* tar up the directory with something like `tar jcf foo-1.2.3.p4.spkg foo-1.2.3.p4/`
* post a link in a trac ticket for review

(Anyone who knows more should correct me if there's a mistake there.)

Thank you, 

You obviously checked the patch, made a few minor layout changes in SPKG.txt and created an updated .spkg file. I've just downloaded your spkg file and it works fine for me. So can this be changed to a positive review?  

I've used CVS before, so am somewhat familiar with version control systems. There needs to be a server though, which tracks the changes. What's the username/password/location for the server? 

So would you in this case have typed

$ cd /home/drake/
$ hg commit sqlite-3.5.3.p4.spkg

The other thing is, where is hg? I don't see it in my path anywhere. I could obviously build it from source. 

Sorry to be so ignorant.

Mercurial is a "distributed version control system", which doesn't require a central server. I'll build it on t2 and see if one of the admins can install it system-wide.

Thanks. 

If its not installed on t2, how have you been doing updating before? 

BTW, I do have admin rights on t2 anyway.

I just used a different machine; everyone has the same home directory on sage.math as on t2.

And some admin person installed Mercurial, so it's now in /usr/local/bin...although it doesn't work unless you do "`export  PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/`". Or some enterprising admin could edit /usr/local/bin/hg to have this before the first "try:" line:

```
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages')
```
and then delete the "import sys" below.
