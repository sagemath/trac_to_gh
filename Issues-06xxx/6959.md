Looks mainly good to me -- patch applies and tests (in sage/modular/modform) pass.  One glitch:

```
        if not all_embeddings: 
 	            return A 
 	return A 
```
looks like a typo.

It does not seem very efficient to factor all the n in the range, and that is not the way I have always done this.  The result is pretty slow -- for example, if you wanted to compute all a_n for n<10^6, this is not good enough:

```
sage: f = CuspForms(11,2).newforms()[0]; f
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: time an = f.anlist(1000)
CPU times: user 0.40 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.40 s
Wall time: 0.40 s
sage: time an = f.anlist(10000)
CPU times: user 13.84 s, sys: 0.79 s, total: 14.63 s
Wall time: 14.65 s
sage: time an = f.anlist(100000)
#(gave up waiting after a few minutes)
```
On second thoughts it is probably computing the a_p which is slow here.  But are they even cached?

```
sage: time an = f.aplist(10000)
CPU times: user 11.09 s, sys: 0.65 s, total: 11.74 s
Wall time: 11.81 s
sage: time an = f.anlist(10000)
CPU times: user 13.71 s, sys: 0.69 s, total: 14.40 s
Wall time: 14.53 s
```
-- it seems not.
