A first attempt is at:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/pynifti-p0.spkg

This installs fine on my mac running 10.5, but I have not tested it on anything else.  However, the build instructions are very generic, and no patches were necessary, so I would think this would be OK on most linux systems at least.
