Manin symbols over number fields (related to modular symbols) are used for computing modular forms over those fields.  An implementation valid for general number fields is in prepration by Maite Aranes.

This will be part of a larger project to implement modular forms over number fields in Sage.

Just my two cents.

Mathematically: Both the normalization (lines 415 - 455) and the list creation (lines 993 - 1018) look good to me, forming the heart of the module. Index-looking up is done by list searching, well. The other internal functions lift_to_sl2_Ok, make_coprime, psi also look good.

Non-mathematically: This is how more Sage library code should look like. If this applies cleanly to the newest Sage alpha, doctests all pass and have 100% coverage, and the ReST documentation compiles OK (I didn't check, but I'd be surprised if there was any issue), then I'd vote to let this in.
