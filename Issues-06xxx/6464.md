At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e3b8dce14b6375bf) thread, there is a patch to fix a Unicode problem related to typesetting Korean in notebook worksheets. Here's an essential snippet:

```
So I find the python code and modify it.

sageroot/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/cell.py:211

211 : </script>"""%(self.__id,self.__id,self.__text)

=>

211 : </script>"""%(self.__id,self.__id,((self.__text).decode
('utf-8')).encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace'))
```
This might be related to #6417.
