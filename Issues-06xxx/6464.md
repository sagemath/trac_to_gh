At this [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/e3b8dce14b6375bf) thread, there is a patch to fix a Unicode problem related to typesetting Korean in notebook worksheets. Here's an essential snippet:

```
So I find the python code and modify it.

sageroot/devel/sage/sage/server/notebook/cell.py:211

211 : </script>"""%(self.__id,self.__id,self.__text)

=>

211 : </script>"""%(self.__id,self.__id,((self.__text).decode
('utf-8')).encode('ascii', 'xmlcharrefreplace'))
```
This might be related to #6417.

Tried this in FF3.5 and Safari 4 on Mac OSX.5 Intel.  Tried, saved, quit, resaved, went from browser to browser several times, and nothing made it break.  Character sets I used include 한글, Cyrillic, üöä, some Chinese characters, Arabic, ... I didn't try all the ones available on my system, but it seems like this solution will work fine.  It's really sort of embarrassing this isn't in yet, to be honest.  

Test for the above file passes when added to 4.1.1, so positive review - maybe mvgnu didn't use a clean tree? Don't forget to close #6562 as well.
