This trivial patch adds basic support for constant functions

Such a function could be written as lambda x: constant, but that's not picklable. Besides, this should eventually be cythoned for speed.

Prerequisite for #4326.

> How is this intended to be used?  


One of my use case looks like:

def my_objects(<some parameters>, predicate = ConstantFunction(True)):
    """
    Returns all the objects blah blah blah (as an EnumeratedSet)
    Optionally, a predicate can be specified to select only those objects satisfying the predicate

Another one looks like:

def generating_series(..., weight = ConstantFunction(1)):
    ...

> What are your typical constants? 


So far, True, 1, Integer(1)

Btw: with UniqueRepresentation, the two first yield the same constant function with the current implementation, thanks to this horror:

    sage: { 1: 'a', True: 'b' }
    {1: 'b'}

Fixed patch in a couple minutes.

> Are there instances where you'd want a non-constant function to be used in the same place? 


Yes. Actually, that's the case in all the situations I encountered so far
