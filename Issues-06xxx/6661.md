When there is a `KeyboardInterrupt` while `_expect_expr` talks with some interface, there is *always* the warning message

```
Control-C pressed.  Interrupting R. Please wait a few seconds...
```
before the `KeyboardInterrupt` is re-raised -- regardless whether the interface is R or anything else!

The patch that I am about to post would instead print 

```
"Control-C pressed.  Interrupting %s. Please wait a few seconds..."%self
```
where `self` is the interface.

Meanwhile there also is a doc test (thank you for pointing me to the "alarm" function, William!), so, I think the patch is ready for review!

Now, we have a better warning message:

```
sage: print sage0.eval("alarm(1); singular._expect_expr('1')")
Control-C pressed.  Interrupting Singular. Please wait a few seconds...

    839                     break

    841
    842     def _sendstr(self, str):

    841
    842     def _sendstr(self, str):

```

Note that it correctly says "Interrupting Singular" or "Interrupting Gap".
