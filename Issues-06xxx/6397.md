Extracting a square root of a power series is implemented in `power_series_ring_element.pyx`.  Could we have the more general "improving a root of a polynomial" Newton's method?

My use case is calculating Puiseaux expansions around points of algebraic curves.

Here's a stand-alone implementation that needs to be plugged into the hell that is `polynomial.roots()`.
