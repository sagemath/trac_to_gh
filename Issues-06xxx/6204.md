This small patch makes norms for degree 1 relative number fields avoid pari, which fails (in our old version) in this case.  I also added a doctest or two.

This looks good. Points for adding doctests to a bunch of functions, not just the ones you happened to add code to.

On a related note, should we start a wiki page or something with all the workarounds we can remove once we update to a modern Pari?

I'm changing this back to "needs work". The problem seems to be that we need to work around a pari bug in "gens_reduced" as well as in "relative_norm".

I don't think there's anything wrong with `gens_reduced`.  

It seems to be a coercion/conversion problem, caused, or at least not helped, by the behaviour of `relativize`:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^4 + 2*x^2 + 7)
sage: L.<b, c> = K.relativize(a + 1); L 
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x - c + 1 over its base field
sage: L_base = L.base_field()
sage: L_base(b)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce element into this number field
sage: L_base(c)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Cannot coerce element into this number field
sage: parent(b) == L
True
sage: parent(c) == L
True
sage: parent(c) == L_base
False
```

The doctest for `is_principal` conflicts somewhat with changes in #5842.
