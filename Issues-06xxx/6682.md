Attachment: **[prependify.py.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6682/prependify.py.gz)**

From my brief experience with Unicode in SageNB sources (#7249 adds them to doctests), we may just need to

* Prepend `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to every .py file.  I assume we should do this for .pyx files, too.  I've attached a [script](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6682/prependify.py.gz) that can do this, although I'm sure there are more succinct ways.

* Use `unicode` strings for docstrings that contain non-ASCII Unicode characters.  For example,

```python
def f(n):
    u"""
    Transmogrifies ``n``, heinously. â˜º
    """
    return transmogrify(n, algorithm='heinous')
```

Note: At #8000, Minh suggested polling sage-devel about allowing non-ASCII characters in Sage library code.  I'll try to do this soon.
