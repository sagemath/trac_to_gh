You are right about the comment typo, I will do a micro-patch to fix it when the pile of exam scripts on my desk has decreased far enough.

I am adding William to the CC list, since he certainly knows about weight 1 forms.

REFEREE REPORT:

There is not a single example in this patch of computing an Eisenstein series of weight 1.  Can you add some examples?


Also, this seems very very wrong to me:

```
 	361	        try: 
 	362	            d = self.dimension() 
 	363	        except NotImplementedError: 
 	364	            d = self._dim_eisenstein() 
 	365	        self.__module = free_module.VectorSpace(self.base_ring(), d) 
```

You've changed the dimension for *ambient* modular forms spaces to return the dimension of the Eisenstein subspace in case the dimension function isn't implemented.  What if I take a space with both a cuspidal and eisenstein part -- it'll just say the dimension of the whole space is the dimension of the eisenstein subspace. Somehow I have the feeling you made this change to get things to work in a special case of interest to you, not worrying that you might break other cases.

For your second point: if you install the patch and try it out, you'll see that (for instance) ModularForms(Gamma1(23), 1) will raise a NotImplementedError, as it should, but EisensteinForms(Gamma1(23),1) will work.

Even once we have proper code for calculating weight 1 cusp forms this will still be an issue, since for large N calculating dim S_1(Gamma_1(N)) is a serious and time-consuming calculation that we don't want to be forced to do solely in order to know how many zeros to stick at the front of the Eisenstein series.

REFEREE REPORT:

* This comment must be changed, and I've changed it in the attached referee patch:

```
File:           /scratch/wstein/build/sage-4.1/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/modular/modform/ambient.py
Definition:     M.module(self)
Docstring:
    
            Return the underlying free module corresponding to this space of
            modular forms. This is a free module (viewed as a tuple space) of
            the same dimension as this space over the same base ring.
```
This is because of the following example:

```
sage: M = ModularForms(Gamma1(23), 1,prec=20); M
Modular Forms space of dimension (unknown) for Congruence Subgroup Gamma1(23) of weight 1 over Rational Field
sage: M.module()
Vector space of dimension 11 over Rational Field
```
so it is now no longer the case that `M.module().dimension() == M.dimension()` as is stated in the docstring.
The change should just be to state that "If the dimension of M can be computed, then [same as before].  Otherwise, the dimension of M.module() may be smaller.  E.g., in the case of weight 1 forms..."  Then include an example in the docstring that illustrates this. 


This ticket should be changed to "[with patch; positive review]" as soon as somebody else signs off on the referee patch I've attached.
