#6290 introduced a way to custom-define the latex style of functions, but it would be great if something similar was made possible for any variable. I used to do it in the following way, but now I get an error message:

sage: var('hi kunsati delyui')

sage: hi._latex_ = lambda: 'h_i'
     
sage: kunsati._latex_ = lambda: 'K_{unsat,i}' 
   
sage: delyui._latex_ = lambda: '\delta_{yu,i}'

  
Traceback (most recent call last):


...

AttributeError: 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression' object attribute '_latex_' is read-only

How could the Pynac funtionality of setting latex names for variables at creation be exposed?
