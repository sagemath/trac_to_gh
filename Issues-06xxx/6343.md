This patch implements TestSuite(object).run()  which runs
systematic checks on the object. Here is a typical call:

```
     sage: TestSuite(ZZ).run(verbose = True)
     running ._test_an_element() ... done
     running ._test_element_pickling() ... done
     running ._test_not_implemented_methods() ... done
     running ._test_pickling() ... done
```
In practice, TestSuite(o).run() runs all the methods named _test_* of the object o.
The _test_* methods are typically implemented by abstract super classes
and in particular via categories, in order to enforce standard
behavior and API (_test_pickling, _test_an_element), or provide
mathematical sanity checks (_test_associativity).

For consistent error reporting, the _test_* methods in turn must use
the new gadget sage.misc.sage_unittest.InstanceTester to actually
run the tests.

This is used by the category patches #5891 and followers

<a id='comment:6'></a>Patch reworked, after the discussion on sage-devel.

Note: After peeking again into the testunit framework, I finally went for TestSuite(object).run() which
is most consistent with it, while being meaningful.

The otherwise discussed functionality TestSuite(object).associativity() will be implemented in a later patch
(if deemed useful in the meantime).

This is necessary as docstring in methods whose names begin with an underscore (i.e. `_`) would not show up in the reference manual.\n\n\nAgreed, that's better (but not for that argument: my opinion is that _* methods, or at least _*_ and __*__ methods should show up in the manual; but that's another discussion).\n\nThanks for your doc fixes! I double checked them.\n\n> Apart from that, here's a small issue. Can you provide examples and/or tests for the function `_test_pickling()` in `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx`?

Replying to [comment:13 mvngu]:
> The patch `trac_6343-reviewer.patch` fixes some typos and copy the docstring for `__init__()` in the class `InstanceTester` to the class itself. This is necessary as docstring in methods whose names begin with an underscore (i.e. `_`) would not show up in the reference manual.


Agreed, that's better (but not for that argument: my opinion is that _* methods, or at least _*_ and __*__ methods should show up in the manual; but that's another discussion).

Thanks for your doc fixes! I double checked them.

> Apart from that, here's a small issue. Can you provide examples and/or tests for the function `_test_pickling()` in `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx`? The doctest coverage for `sage/structure/sage_object.pyx` is very short of 50% and we don't want to make it more difficult to reach 100% coverage.


Thanks also for spotting the missing doctest. The attached patch fixes this.
