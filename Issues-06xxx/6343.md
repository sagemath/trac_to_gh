This patch implements TestSuite(object).run()  which runs
systematic checks on the object. Here is a typical call:

```
     sage: TestSuite(ZZ).run(verbose = True)
     running ._test_an_element() ... done
     running ._test_element_pickling() ... done
     running ._test_not_implemented_methods() ... done
     running ._test_pickling() ... done
```
In practice, TestSuite(o).run() runs all the methods named _test_* of the object o.
The _test_* methods are typically implemented by abstract super classes
and in particular via categories, in order to enforce standard
behavior and API (_test_pickling, _test_an_element), or provide
mathematical sanity checks (_test_associativity).

For consistent error reporting, the _test_* methods in turn must use
the new gadget sage.misc.sage_unittest.InstanceTester to actually
run the tests.

This is used by the category patches #5891 and followers

Patch reworked, after the discussion on sage-devel.

Note: After peeking again into the testunit framework, I finally went for TestSuite(object).run() which
is most consistent with it, while being meaningful.

The otherwise discussed functionality TestSuite(object).associativity() will be implemented in a later patch
(if deemed useful in the meantime).

Agreed, that's better (but not for that argument: my opinion is that _* methods, or at least _*_ and __*__ methods should show up in the manual; but that's another discussion).

Thanks for your doc fixes! I double checked them.

Thanks also for spotting the missing doctest. The attached patch fixes this.
