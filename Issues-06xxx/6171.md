Before this patch:

```
sage: sqrt(10.1, prec=100)
...
TypeError: sqrt() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prec'
```
This is despite the fact that the docstring for sqrt lists as one of its inputs

```
            -  ``prec`` - integer (default: None): if None, returns
               an exact square root; otherwise returns a numerical square root if
               necessary, to the given bits of precision.
```
After this patch:

```
sage: sqrt(10.1, prec=100)
3.1780497164141406804582045589
sage: sqrt(10.1, prec=200)
3.1780497164141406804582045589354800553656236461562686475080
