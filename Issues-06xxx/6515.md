This has been brought up several times on the mailing lists. As a specific example 

```
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: solve([x^2-1],x)
[x == -1, x == 1]
```

At the very least, we could probably filter out the "solutions" that violate the assumptions. 


```
sage: [all(a.subs(s) for a in assumptions()) for s in solve(x^2-1==0, x)]
[False, True]
```

The patch looks good and doctests pass. There is one minor problem, the line

```
sage: GenericDeclaration(x, 'rational').contradicts(y==pi)
```

is repeated several times in the doctest for `sage.symbolic.assumptions.GenericDeclaration.contradicts()`.

I attached a patch to change these lines and add an `INPUT` field to the docstring. Can you look over my patch and change the status to positive_review if you agree with the changes?
