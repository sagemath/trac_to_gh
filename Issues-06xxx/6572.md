Depends on #6642 and #7149.

As a result of all of this, some more doctests are found by `sage -t`.

as well as some doctests involving starting and stopping the Singular console, for example.

For me, this passes all tests on Mac OS X (both 32-bit and 64-bit), and also on a 32-bit linux box (an old Ubuntu machine) and a 64-bit linux box (sage.math).  It would be best to fix the skipped tests, but that can go in another ticket if no one knows how to do it right now.

This may be fixed now - see #6642.  If so, I guess one could put that back in the tutorial.

Okay, that makes sense.  The new scripts patch changes the regular expression to fix this, I think.

Now the problem is that the file (added since this ticket was opened) `tour_graphtheory.rst` is a *complete* disaster, with 15 doctest failures.  I can fix lots of the failed doctests by adding "..." and ".. link" in various places, but I don't know what to do about failures like these:

```
    sage: g.plot(edge_colors=g.edge_coloring(hex_colors=True))
    AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'edge_coloring'

    sage: g.vertex_coloring()
    AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'vertex_coloring'

    sage: print g.max_matching()
    AttributeError: 'Graph' object has no attribute 'max_matching'
```
I don't know what was intended and therefore I don't know how to fix it.  I'll post a patch that fixes what I can.
