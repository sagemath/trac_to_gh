There is one small problem with this.  Doing the naive change - 

```
    def __copy__(self, implementation='networkx', sparse=None):
```
yields:

```
sage: g=Graph({0:[0,1,1,2]})
sage: copy(g)
Looped multi-graph on 3 vertices
sage: g.__copy__(sparse=True)
Looped multi-graph on 3 vertices
sage: copy(g,sparse=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError: copy() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sparse'
```
It's not clear to me how to deal with this; changing the global 'copy' to handle keywords seems ill-advised.  On the other hand, there definitely is code (elsewhere) that uses the keywords implementation and sparse, at least in graph_generators.py.

I can't say that I agree with the point of this ticket.

Certainly there should be a `__copy__` defined for graphs, so that

```
sage: G = copy(Graph())
```
works. However, the main use case of the `copy` method for graphs (for me, at least) is when I want to change underlying implementations. What was

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: C = G.copy(implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
```
won't work as

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: copy(G, implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
```
but instead we now need to do:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: C = G.__copy__(implementation='c_graph', sparse=False)
```

Which is an ugly, pointless change in API. Why don't we just define `__copy__`, and acknowledge that in some cases, it makes sense for objects to have a `copy` method?

Okay, here is how I dealt with these issues.

1. We can't use the generic deprecation thing from #7515 here, because it would say to use copy instead of copy!  Unfortunately.  On the plus side, that's one less for #7559. 

2. I have not deprecated copy() from the generic graph class, only the yang-baxter one.  There is now a `__copy__` for generic graphs.  In order to deal with a tricky thing on Dynkin diagrams, I had to define a `__copy__` method for them, which however is EXACTLY the same as the generic Python copy from the copy module.

I really, really worked hard to make sure I caught every possible place where this causes problems, and it passes all doctests, but please think hard where it would make a difference.  I also hope I won't have to rebase it again :)
