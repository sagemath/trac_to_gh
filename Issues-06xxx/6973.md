An interactive vector graphics editor accessible from the Sage notebook or the command-line may have a variety of uses:

* Drawing diagrams.
* Annotating images.  See [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/contents.html)'s [SVG backend](http://matplotlib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/matplotlib/trunk/matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_svg.py?view=markup).
* Manipulating graphs and knots.
* Animating objects.  See [SMIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronized_Multimedia_Integration_Language).
* Creating a free-form 2D workspace.

Candidates:

* [jsvectoreditor](http://code.google.com/p/jsvectoreditor/) - [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/)-based editor renders both SVG (non-IE) and VML (IE).
* [SVG-edit](http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/) - Inkscape-lite.  See [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/svg-edit/browse_thread/thread/26bdc43b4f241ae9/77768c078a98b30d?#77768c078a98b30d) and [this one on matplotlib's SVG](http://groups.google.com/group/svg-edit/browse_thread/thread/91cf3b76f3e4eb4f/77237f209dbe1a81?#77237f209dbe1a81).

What do you mean ? Do you agree or disagree with me ?

If somebody wants to edit an SVG file, she can use any existing SVG editor. I do not
see why sage should provide such an editor. Do we aim to replace every single software around ? Has this anything to do with mathematics ?

It seems there are at least some valid use cases, e.g. for graphical notebook widgets for objects in Sage (something which is actively being explored).

I don't know that there's necessarily a case within that for editing arbitrary SVG graphics, though I don't think there'd much case to be made for this outside the context of a notebook widget (anything beyond that is maybe too complicated...)
