This changed a while back, but as long as the old form is in the library we won't be able to really implement a (Python-style) `__new__` and also people will keep using it in new code by analogy.

Attachment: **[6590-cinit.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6590/6590-cinit.patch.gz)**

How come the some of the new `__cinit__` functions have different signatures from the corresponding `__init__` functions?  I thought the signatures should be the same, or at least the `__cinit__` should have a *args or **kwds to accept the arguments passed to `__init__`


In particular, I refer to sage/libs/ntl/ntl_mat_GF2.pyx, sage/libs/ntl/ntl_mat_ZZ.pyx,  sage/matrix/matrix_integer_2x2.pyx, etc.
