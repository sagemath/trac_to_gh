We expect the following example to take about 10 seconds:

```
sage: @cached_function
sage: def foo(x = 5):
...       print "computing foo(%s)"%x
...       sleep(10)
...       return 0
sage: w = walltime()
sage: foo()
computing foo(5)
sage: foo(5)
computing foo(5)
sage: foo(x=5)
computing foo(5)
sage: print "that took %s seconds!"%walltime(w)
that took 29.9967029095 seconds!
```

... but that obviously isn't the case.  fix it!

Here's a problem:

```
sage: class Foo:
    def bar(self, a, b, c=0, d=None):
        return a
sage: A = Foo()
sage: A.bar(1,2,3,4)
1
sage: from sage.misc.function_mangling import ArgumentFixer
sage: AA = ArgumentFixer(A.bar)
sage: AA.fix_to_named(1,2,3,4)
((), (('self', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 3), ('c', 4), ('d', None)))

```

Here, self isn't 1. a should be 1.
