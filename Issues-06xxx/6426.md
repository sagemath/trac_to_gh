This is a repository of Magma code for arithmetic geometry and number theory.  The latest spkg is echidna-2.0.spkg, can be downloaded from:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/

This should be tested with the Sage worksheet:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.sws

A printed pdf version is here:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.pdf

This spkg is submitted for consideration as an optional 
package.

The function magma.attach_echidna tries to use $SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/echidna/echidna.spec  but the directory into which echidna has been installed is called data/extcode/echidna-2.0/.  I suggest changing the spkg-install script to make these agree: probably better not to have the version number in that pathname (since then the file magma.py would need changing every time there's a new version).

I did not try changing the spkg myself.  I'll be happy to try this again when David has.

I also changed the milestone to 4.1.1 since the required patch at #6395 has that milestone, but there's still the possibility of both getting into 4.1.

Oops, I will attach an update, since I forgot to include the error 
message, which results after detaching echidna, in the example for 
detach_echidna.  Moreover, I had to reattach the Magma package files 
since ECHIDNA was overwriting some of Magma's files.

Moreover sage -t magma.py run cleanly for the wrong reasons. Doing

sage -t --optional magma.py

I found that there were lots of errors due to printing changes in 
Magma (tested against version 2.15-7).  To fix the doctests, I had 
to change " to ''.  It is possible that this breaks ReST syntax. 
Does someone want to check and, if so, come up with a solution?

I ran into a lot of problems trying to evaluate the worksheet cells -- some Sage functions ins there (e.g. FunctionField(ZZ)) do not exist.

And if you have extra stuff implemented in Sage which the worksheet example need, why not include them (on a separate ticket) in Sage?  (There are some in magma.py but not many).

I rebuilt the ref manual and it looks fine.

I don't know what the magma2.py file is for -- I ignored it.

In order to run the complete worksheet, one needs a could of python
commands:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/sage/elliptic_curves.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/sage/function_fields.tgz

for which I have yet to make a trac ticket (the former file is still 
under development and the latter one is a trivial user convenience).
One just needs to load the all.py in each directory after untarring.

Moreover, for the database commands, the underlying files needed are:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/CrvG2.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/IgusaLIX.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/FldCM.tgz

The file magma.2.py resulted from not choosing "replace" on my first 
resubmission of magma.py, after which I replaced it with a note to 
ignore it (since now the file magma.py is the latest).
