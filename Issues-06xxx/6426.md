This is a repository of Magma code for arithmetic geometry and number theory.  The latest spkg is echidna-2.0.spkg, can be downloaded from:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/

This should be tested with the Sage worksheet:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.sws

A printed pdf version is here:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.pdf

This spkg is submitted for consideration as an optional 
package.

The function magma.attach_echidna tries to use $SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode/echidna/echidna.spec  but the directory into which echidna has been installed is called data/extcode/echidna-2.0/.  I suggest changing the spkg-install script to make these agree: probably better not to have the version number in that pathname (since then the file magma.py would need changing every time there's a new version).

I did not try changing the spkg myself.  I'll be happy to try this again when David has.

I also changed the milestone to 4.1.1 since the required patch at #6395 has that milestone, but there's still the possibility of both getting into 4.1.

I changed the spkg-install in echidna-2.0.spkg:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/echidna-2.0.spkg

Moreover, I put in an example in the attached magma.2.py 
and, realising that there was no detach function, added 
both detach_spec and detach_echidna, so users can get back 
to a clean version of magma.

Oops, I will attach an update, since I forgot to include the error 
message, which results after detaching echidna, in the example for 
detach_echidna.  Moreover, I had to reattach the Magma package files 
since ECHIDNA was overwriting some of Magma's files.

Moreover sage -t magma.py run cleanly for the wrong reasons. Doing

sage -t --optional magma.py

I found that there were lots of errors due to printing changes in 
Magma (tested against version 2.15-7).  To fix the doctests, I had 
to change " to ''.  It is possible that this breaks ReST syntax. 
Does someone want to check and, if so, come up with a solution?

The new spkg works, and the new magma.py is ok (one minor doctest filaure in the `__iter__` function which I have fixed).  See my attached match, which applies to 4.1.alpha2 and yields a correct magma.py.

I ran into a lot of problems trying to evaluate the worksheet cells -- some Sage functions ins there (e.g. FunctionField(ZZ)) do not exist.  David, can you include an ordinary python file with these tests and demos in?  And if you have extra stuff implemented in Sage which the worksheet example need, why not include them (on a separate ticket) in Sage?  (There are some in magma.py but not many).

I rebuilt the ref manual and it looks fine.

I don't know what the magma2.py file is for -- I ignored it.

In order to run the complete worksheet, one needs a could of python
commands:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/sage/elliptic_curves.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/sage/function_fields.tgz

for which I have yet to make a trac ticket (the former file is still 
under development and the latter one is a trivial user convenience).
One just needs to load the all.py in each directory after untarring.

Moreover, for the database commands, the underlying files needed are:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/CrvG2.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/IgusaLIX.tgz
http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/FldCM.tgz

The file magma.2.py resulted from not choosing "replace" on my first 
resubmission of magma.py, after which I replaced it with a note to 
ignore it (since now the file magma.py is the latest).
