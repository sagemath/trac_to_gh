This is a repository of Magma code for arithmetic geometry and number theory.  The latest spkg is echidna-2.0.spkg, can be downloaded from:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/

This should be tested with the Sage worksheet:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.sws

A printed pdf version is here:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/doc/ECHIDNA.pdf

This spkg is submitted for consideration as an optional 
package.

I did not try changing the spkg myself.  I'll be happy to try this again when David has.

I also changed the milestone to 4.1.1 since the required patch at #6395 has that milestone, but there's still the possibility of both getting into 4.1.

I found that there were lots of errors due to printing changes in

The new spkg works, and the new magma.py is ok (one minor doctest filaure in the __iter__ function which I have fixed).  See my attached match, which applies to 4.1.alpha2 and yields a correct magma.py.

I ran into a lot of problems trying to evaluate the worksheet cells -- some Sage functions ins there (e.g. FunctionField(ZZ)) do not exist.  David, can you include an ordinary python file with these tests and demos in?  And if you have extra stuff implemented in Sage which the worksheet example need, why not include them (on a separate ticket) in Sage?  (There are some in magma.py but not many).

I rebuilt the ref manual and it looks fine.

I don't know what the magma2.py file is for -- I ignored it.

commands:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/alg/sage/elliptic_curves.tgz

for which I have yet to make a trac ticket (the former file is still

One just needs to load the all.py in each directory after untarring.

Moreover, for the database commands, the underlying files needed are:

http://echidna.maths.usyd.edu.au/kohel/dbs/IgusaLIX.tgz

The file magma.2.py resulted from not choosing "replace" on my first 
resubmission of magma.py, after which I replaced it with a note to 
ignore it (since now the file magma.py is the latest).
