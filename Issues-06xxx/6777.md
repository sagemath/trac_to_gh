This is with a modified

```
| Sage Version 4.1.rc1, Release Date: 2009-07-07                     |
```

Mac OS X, Intel hardware.

```
sage: RealField(300)['x']( [ 1, ComplexField(300).gen(), 0 ])


------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occured in SAGE.
This probably occured because a *compiled* component
of SAGE has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory)
or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off.
You might want to run SAGE under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
SAGE will now terminate (sorry).

Process SAGE exited abnormally with code 1

I don't obtain a segmentation fault, but this is on Debian GNU/Linux.

On [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d4807256e57cd843), it is discussed that one gets a rather strange phenomenon: Before the traceback starts, some ERROR is printed.

```
sage: RealField(300)['x']( [ 1, ComplexField(300).gen(), 0 ])
ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1375, 0))

ERROR: An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input
The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid
The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line statement', (1375, 0))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```
I get this with unpatched sage (hence, no segfault), and Michael Orlitzky reports the same after fixing the segfault.

However, with some of my patches applied, one simply gets a straight forward traceback:

```
sage: RealField(300)['x']([ ComplexField(300).gen() ]) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='1.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000*I') to real number.
```

Could you test whether #9138 (or perhaps #11900) actually fixes the problem already?

The fix is in #11900, and it has a positive review, so I'm adding it as a dependency before a doctest can be added.
