This issue could well arise in other plotting code, I haven't checked yet.  But at least for line3d:

```
sage: mypoints = [vector([1,2,3]), vector([4,5,6])]
sage: type(mypoints[0])
<type 'sage.modules.vector_integer_dense.Vector_integer_dense'>
```
but then:

```
sage: L = line3d(mypoints)
sage: type(mypoints[0])
<type 'tuple'>
```

so vectors are changed to tuples.

All is well.  And this does not occur in line2d, as far as I have tested it, because of the grid system.
