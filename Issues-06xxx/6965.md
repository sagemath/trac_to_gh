I should have posted this question here instead of at #6865, as the
answer is probably interesting to many people here.  I'd heard things
about MANIFEST.in, but for some reason didn't have a clear idea of what
it was or what I should do about it.  It would be nice if something was
added to the developer's guide...

Looks good. Applied OK against Sage 4.3.rc0. As a side note, the URL for "Specifying the files to distribute" could also be 

http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute

which is usually more up-to-date than the given URL. The given URL is more specific to Python 2.6.2.
