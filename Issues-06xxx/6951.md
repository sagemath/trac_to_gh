<a id='comment:2'></a>Briefly, we're missing a file "install-sh" for Sun, and possibly a switch change from -O2 to -O0 on Itanium; copied from my post at the sage-devel thread:
Hi Minh,

obviously (look at your own trace output), you are talking about
"singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.spkg", not
"singular-3-1-0-4-20090723.spkg".

Just looking at the top entries of the "SPKG.txt" file of the old
(Sage-4.1.1) "singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0.spkg", and of the current
Sage-4.1.2-alpha "singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.spkg", shows what the
problem is, that the latter spkg might be broken also on Itanium
(ia64, see trac #6360 and #6240) i.e. not only on Sun, and what to do
about it.
I can look into building a new spkg with the necessary fixes tomorrow,
or the day after, if nobody beats me to it.

Cheers,
Georg
