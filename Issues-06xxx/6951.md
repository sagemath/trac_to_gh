Here is the relevant portion:

```
for file in *.h; do \
../.././install-sh -c $file /scratch/mvngu/sage-4.1.2.alpha1-6945-readline-cliquer-ecl/local/include/singular; \
done
/bin/sh: ../.././install-sh: not found
```

IIRC Dave fixed this before but I must have missed to include his fix (the update was a bit chaotic because quite a few fixed from different people went in). David, would you mind reminding me how to fix this?

Briefly, we're missing a file "install-sh" for Sun, and possibly a switch change from -O2 to -O0 on Itanium; copied from my post at the sage-devel thread:
Hi Minh,

obviously (look at your own trace output), you are talking about
"singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.spkg", not
"singular-3-1-0-4-20090723.spkg".

Just looking at the top entries of the "SPKG.txt" file of the old
(Sage-4.1.1) "singular-3-1-0-2-20090620.p0.spkg", and of the current
Sage-4.1.2-alpha "singular-3-1-0-4-20090818.spkg", shows what the
problem is, that the latter spkg might be broken also on Itanium
(ia64, see trac #6360 and #6240) i.e. not only on Sun, and what to do
about it.
I can look into building a new spkg with the necessary fixes tomorrow,
or the day after, if nobody beats me to it.

Cheers,
Georg

There is no 4.1.2.alpha3. Sage 4.1.2.alpha3 was William Stein's release for working on making the notebook a standalone package.
