After this last round of merging:

```
sage -t -long sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py
         [891.9 s]
```

This is 15 minutes, and the second longest doctest takes just over 4 minutes.

Component: **doctest coverage**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

On sage.math this is:

```
sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py"
         [161.1 s]
```

so this is no longer even a problem.
