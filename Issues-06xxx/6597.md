Looks good to me.  All tests pass with it once #6343 is applied to Sage 4.1.1.

Note it takes awhile to build everything.

Thanks Mike for the review!

> Note it takes awhile to build everything.


Yeah, I had to modify the .pxd of Map (or Morphism) to get pickling to work.

I am glad this will be soon in so that we don't have this patch anymore in Sage-Combinat.
