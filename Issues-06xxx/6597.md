This patch raises SetMorphism to 100% doctest, and implements equality and pickling.

It also renames and doctests the following methods in Map, which were
unused and not doctested:

- test_extra_slots  -> _extra_slots_test
- update_slots_test -> _update_slots_test

It depends on #6343 (TestSuite)

The category patches #5891

Looks good to me.  All tests pass with it once #6343 is applied to Sage 4.1.1.

Note it takes awhile to build everything.

Thanks Mike for the review!

> Note it takes awhile to build everything.

Yeah, I had to modify the .pxd of Map (or Morphism) to get pickling to work.

I am glad this will be soon in so that we don't have this patch anymore in Sage-Combinat.
