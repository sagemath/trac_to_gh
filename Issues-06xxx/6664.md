This just tweaks #6419 so that it works with Sphinx v0.6.x's `autodoc` extension.  The main change is to defer to Sphinx's decision, if the object is not a nested class.

I think that having different versions of the reference manual was discussed at some point, but without definite outcomes or guidelines.  Maybe it should be discussed on sage-devel?

At the moment, though, including private methods is a bit problematic.  First, `__weakref__` appears sort of at random, and then some classes get all sorts of weird extra methods, maybe inherited from another class?  See the `Matrix` class in `SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/doc/output/html/en/reference/sage/matrix/matrix0.html`, for example; there is an entry for `__delitem__`, and the entry for `__init__` is wrong: it looks generic rather than the one which is actually in the file.  Maybe this has to do with it being Cython rather than Python.

Is it better to exclude all private methods, or to include them at the price of having all sorts of extra crap in addition?  I say we continue to exclude them until we can figure out how to fix this.  So let's keep this patch for now.  I'll give it a positive review.

Does this really depend on #6586, or can it be merged now?

It's not dependent, according to `du -s`.  I tested this with and without the patch, with Sphinx 0.5.1.
