I have updated the scripts (attached to the ticket) to the ones on DS's home page on 3 April 2010, which are dated as follows:
- ell.gp (v. 2009-03-25)
- ellQ.gp (v. 2008-04-29)
- qfsolve.gp (v. 2008-02-26)
The patch (to appear) applies to 4.3.5 and fixes some small things:  Simon's variable DEBUGLEVEL has been renamed DEBUGLEVEL_ell, and some of the verbose output changes a little.  ALso, some "generators" appear in a different order or are otherwise (mathematically) trivially different.

This does not fix other issues with these scripts, as in #5153.

So was I before I did this!

OK.  You need to be careful, since you will be changing files outside $SAGE_ROOT/devel, which are therefore not covered by the cloning system, so you have to work a bit harder both to apply the patches and to unapply them.  I will assume that you will use mercurial queues (but it would be possible without).

First make a clone in the usual way, say called simon, so you have created $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-simon as a copy of $SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main.

Now apply the patch to the extcode:

```
cd SAGE_ROOT/data/extcode  
hg qseries      # test that queues have been initialised here;  if not, do hg qinit first
hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6955/trac_6955-simon-update-extcode.patch.gz
hg qpush
```
Now apply the ordinary patch:

```
cd ../../devel/sage-simon
hg qinit  # if not already done
hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6955/trac_6955-simon-update.patch.gz
hg qpush
sage -b
```

That's it applied.  Run, test, as much as you like.  To reverse the changes:

```
# in devel/sage-simon
hg qpop
cd ../../data/extcode
hg qpop
sage -b
```

Thanks a lot for the very helpful comments. I assume the next time I would be able to make a patch myself for this.

All tests passed after having deleted the first change in the patch (it added a space at the start of the file.)

The modified patch corrects this.
