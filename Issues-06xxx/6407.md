Currently `EllipticCurveFormalGroup.mult_by_n()` is implemented simply by applying the group law to itself *n* times (except when working over a field of characteristic zero, in which case a fast algorithm is used).  This linear algorithm should be replaced with the logarithmic double-and-add algorithm (i.e. the additive version of the standard square-and-multiply algorithm).

hlaw's implementation of the double-and-add algorithm resulted in a wasted doubling at the end -- potentially expensive.  My part2 patch is a slight improvement.
