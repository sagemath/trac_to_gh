On systems where dvipng is installed: If in a %latex cell, dvipng fails to produce a good picture, you get basically nothing.  With this patch, this failure is detected, and dvips and convert are then used instead. The failure is detected by running dvipng with the '--picky' option; with this turned on, if dvipng produces any warnings or errors, no png file is produced.  The code then sees if there is a png file; if not, it runs dvips and convert.

This patch also fixes a long-standing complaint of William's: now when there is a problem in a %latex cell, the .log file is printed automatically, instead of just printing the message "An error occurred."

Apply on top of the patch at #6012.

<a id='comment:2'></a>By the way: to test this,

```
latex.extra_preamble('\\usepackage{tkz-graph}')
```
and (taken from [http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html](http://altermundus.com/pages/graph.html)):

```
%latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance   = 4 cm]
     \GraphInit[vstyle=Shade]
     \tikzset{LabelStyle/.style =   {draw,
                                     fill  = yellow,

Before the patch, I just get a little black blob.  After the patch, I get a nice picture.  (This assume that you have the tkz-graph package installed, as well as the most recent version of pgf.)

That is, it won't work before applying that patch: I get no output from this.  With the patch, it produces a picture.

Looks real good - this greatly expands the possibilities for latex packages that can be employed, and the resulting possibilities for latex output.  Works as advertised - tested with various combinations of %latex, %pdflatex, missing dvipng, missing convert, and various types of input.  Passes tests on sage/misc/latex.py.

Apply after the patch at #6012.
