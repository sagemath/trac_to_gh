Mariah Lenox reported:

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
A = 2^(2^17+2^15)  # note the 2 rather than the "s"
a = A * x^31
b = (A * x) * x^30
a == b   # prints "False" ???
```

But

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, implementation='NTL')
A = 2^(2^17+2^15)  # note the 2 rather than the "s"
a = A * (x^31)
b = A * x * (x^30)
a == b   
```
gives True.  So this is definitely either a bug in FLINT (highly likely), or a bug in our wrapper (much less likely, since our wrapper is so generic:

```
cpdef RingElement _mul_(self, RingElement right):
    r"""
    Returns self multiplied by right.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
        sage: (x - 2)*(x^2 - 8*x + 16)
        x^3 - 10*x^2 + 32*x - 32
    """
    cdef Polynomial_integer_dense_flint x = self._new()
    _sig_on
    fmpz_poly_mul(x.__poly, self.__poly,
            (<Polynomial_integer_dense_flint>right).__poly)
    _sig_off
    return x
```

I posted another spkg that adds one critical Cygwin fix, namely naming the library libflint.dll instead of libflint.so:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/patches/flint-1.5.0.p1.spkg

It's based exactly on mhansen's spkg.
