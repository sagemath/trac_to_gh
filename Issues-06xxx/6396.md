Aargh! Every damn thing we do with ideals seems to return different answers on different platforms -- I've never understood why this is and it's fantastically annoying. The ideals are the same ones, of course, but their string representations are different because Pari picks generators in a totally unpredictable way.

I'll fix this when I get around to it (probably after SD16 is over)

The patch `trac_6396-reviewer.patch` makes some adjustment to the docstring introduced by `trac_6396-deg1primes.patch`, and fixes some typos therein. All tests passed on sage.math (a 64-bit machine) and on my 32-bit Debian Lenny machine. Just to let people know, both patches have been merged in sage-4.1.1-alpha0. I can't close this ticket because I don't have the privilege to do so. Sorry, folks :-(
