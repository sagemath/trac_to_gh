Aargh! Every damn thing we do with ideals seems to return different answers on different platforms -- I've never understood why this is and it's fantastically annoying. The ideals are the same ones, of course, but their string representations are different because Pari picks generators in a totally unpredictable way.

I'll fix this when I get around to it (probably after SD16 is over)
