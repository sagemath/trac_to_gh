Aargh! Every damn thing we do with ideals seems to return different answers on different platforms -- I've never understood why this is and it's fantastically annoying. The ideals are the same ones, of course, but their string representations are different because Pari picks generators in a totally unpredictable way.

I'll fix this when I get around to it (probably after SD16 is over)

Hello? I'm marking this as "positive review" so it comes to the attention of the release managers for 4.1.1, who can decide as they see fit what to do given the slightly ambiguous status. All that's needed is for someone to check that the doctests pass on both 64-bit and 32-bit.

(I really would prefer it if this patch didn't hang around bitrotting forever -- this is necessary for a major project I'm working on, which seems to have exposed a remarkable number of bugs; see also #6457, #6458, #6462 and #6463.)
