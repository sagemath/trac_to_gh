Hmm, I'm interested in this functionality, so if nobody else is planning on working on it, I would be up to it.

It seems that the code given as an example only 'works' for 3-edge-connected simple planar graphs. Is this sufficient, or should we also try to make it work for other graphs? Supporting multigraphs might depend on #14657.

Fixing it to work for all plane graphs is not that simple. The problem lies not so much with this code as with the support for plane graphs in Sage. At the moment plane multigraphs are not supported, and I guess that also plane graphs with loops are not supported.

If the input graph is not 3-edge-connected, then the dual will not be a simple plane graph, so no code will work for those graphs until we first add support for plane multigraphs and plane graphs with loops.

Meanwhile there is a function `.faces` for graphs. Therefore it would be quite straightforward to implement the planar dual; something along the lines of :

```
def planar_dual(P):
    return Graph([[tuple(_) for _ in P.faces()], lambda f,g: len(find_intersection(f,g))==1])

Why are you asking for 3-edge-connectivity ? If it's to prevent graphs with a cut-vertex, the requirement is not sufficient and actually the method is apparently working in this case.

```
sage: G = graphs.IcosahedralGraph()*2
sage: G.merge_vertices([0,12])
sage: G.planar_dual()
Graph on 39 vertices
```
We cannot get the dual of a 2d grid or a cycle.

We really need a proper implementation of the decomposition into 3 connected components, or an interface with `OGDF` since it has a fast (and surely the only) implementation of the linear time algorithm.

- add method `planar_dual` in the `Plot/embedding-related methods` table at the top of the file
- `Return the planar dual an embedded graph.` -> `Return the planar dual of an embedded graph.` ?
- if a graph is 4-vertex-connected, then it is also 3-vertex-connected. So you don't need to specify `at least 3-vertex-connected`.
- the `SEEALSO` block must be after the `EXAMPLES` block
- `for g in  [_ for _ in graphs.planar_graphs(i, minimum_connectivity=3)]` -> `for g in  graphs.planar_graphs(i, minimum_connectivity=3)`

Thanks for the comments, David!

I tried to work in the suggested imrovements. 

First I had tried to put `from sage.graphs.graph import Graph` in the top of the file, where all the imports are made, but this failed, due to circular imports.
