Working code is here: http://sagenb.org/home/pub/417/

The worksheet also includes code which lists the faces of a planar embedding of a graph.

Hmm, I'm interested in this functionality, so if nobody else is planning on working on it, I would be up to it.

It seems that the code given as an example only 'works' for 3-edge-connected simple planar graphs. Is this sufficient, or should we also try to make it work for other graphs? Supporting multigraphs might depend on #14657.

Fixing it to work for all plane graphs is not that simple. The problem lies not so much with this code as with the support for plane graphs in Sage. At the moment plane multigraphs are not supported, and I guess that also plane graphs with loops are not supported.

If the input graph is not 3-edge-connected, then the dual will not be a simple plane graph, so no code will work for those graphs until we first add support for plane multigraphs and plane graphs with loops.

The Platonic solids are 3-edge-connected. You need to have graphs with minimum degree at least 3, because otherwise deleting the edges incident to a vertex of minimum degree will disconnect the graph. Also have a look at the methods added by #16970.

Creating a new branch and adding to the graph methods seems the best approach. Be sure to read the developers guide.

Meanwhile there is a function `.faces` for graphs. Therefore it would be quite straightforward to implement the planar dual; something along the lines of :

```
def planar_dual(P):
    return Graph([[tuple(_) for _ in P.faces()], lambda f,g: len(find_intersection(f,g))==1])
```

Therefore my question: Is this ticket really still open or has it been implemented elsewhere?

Why are you asking for 3-edge-connectivity ? If it's to prevent graphs with a cut-vertex, the requirement is not sufficient and actually the method is apparently working in this case.

```
sage: G = graphs.IcosahedralGraph()*2
sage: G.merge_vertices([0,12])
sage: G.planar_dual()
Graph on 39 vertices
```
We cannot get the dual of a 2d grid or a cycle.

We really need a proper implementation of the decomposition into 3 connected components, or an interface with `OGDF` since it has a fast (and surely the only) implementation of the linear time algorithm.

- `for g in  [_ for _ in graphs.planar_graphs(i, minimum_connectivity=3)]` -> `for g in  graphs.planar_graphs(i, minimum_connectivity=3)`
- In fact, the tests using `graphs.planar_graphs` are nice but unduly time consuming. Add 2 sec for the doctests of `generic_graph.py` on my laptop. This is too much. You should use simpler / faster tests.
- in the `TODO` block. You can simply write: `Implement the method for graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected (or at least have a faster 3-vertex-connectivity test)`.
- Usually, we use `from sage.graphs.graph import Graph` and not `from . import graph`. You should do the same
- you have not corrected the not implemented message

Thanks for the comments, David!

I tried to work in the suggested imrovements. 

First I had tried to put `from sage.graphs.graph import Graph` in the top of the file, where all the imports are made, but this failed, due to circular imports.
