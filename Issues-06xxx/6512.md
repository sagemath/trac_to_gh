`sage -docbuild tutorial html` renders all mathematics as images, but if the jsMath library is present, its processor hides all display equations.

See [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cb1687577bf5843e/b453af3a0750ba23?#b453af3a0750ba23).

I agree that the change above looks like the correct one.  Another option was to have jsmath automatically typeset the stuff in the alt parameter of the img files.  Davide Cervone sent me a message with a way to do that:

```

Jason:

I've attached a javascript file that should do the preprocessing that you need.  It implements the suggestion I made to you about making span's with display:none so that the images show until jsMath reprocesses them.  You can load it just before jsMath/easy/load.js, or you could add it to the loadFiles list in easy/load.js.  Let me know if this doesn't do the trick for you.

The javascript code is:

```

(function () {
  var PREPROCESS = function () {
    var parent, span, i;
    var img = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
    for (i = 0; i < img.length; i++) {
      if (img[i].alt) {
        parent = img[i].parentNode.parentNode;
        if (img[i].className === "math") {
          span = img[i].parentNode.insertBefore(document.createElement("span"),img[i]);
          span.className = "math";
          span.appendChild(img[i]);
          span = span.appendChild(document.createElement("span"));
          span.style.display = "none";
          span.appendChild(document.createTextNode(img[i].alt));
        } else if (parent && parent.tagName.toLowerCase() === "div" && parent.className === "math") {
          span = img[i].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement("span"));
          span.style.display = "none";
          span.appendChild(document.createTextNode(img[i].alt));
        }
      }
    }
  };
  
  if (window.addEventListener) {window.addEventListener("load",PREPROCESS,false)}
  else if (window.attachEvent) {window.attachEvent("onload",PREPROCESS)}
  else {window.onload = PREPROCESS}
})();


```
