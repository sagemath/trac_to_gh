`sage -docbuild tutorial html` renders all mathematics as images, but if the jsMath library is present, its processor hides all display equations.

The patch removes a redundant link to jsMath.  Sphinx should now include references to jsMath in its output only if `--jsmath` is part of the command-line.  For example,

`sage -docbuild reference html --jsmath`

I've attached a javascript file that should do the preprocessing that you need.  It implements the suggestion I made to you about making span's with display:none so that the images show until jsMath reprocesses them.  You can load it just before jsMath/easy/load.js, or you could add it to the loadFiles list in easy/load.js.  Let me know if this doesn't do the trick for you.

The javascript code is:

```

(function () {
  var PREPROCESS = function () {
    var parent, span, i;
    var img = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
    for (i = 0; i < img.length; i++) {
      if (img[i].alt) {
        parent = img[i].parentNode.parentNode;
        if (img[i].className === "math") {
          span = img[i].parentNode.insertBefore(document.createElement("span"),img[i]);
          span.className = "math";
          span.appendChild(img[i]);
          span = span.appendChild(document.createElement("span"));
          span.style.display = "none";
          span.appendChild(document.createTextNode(img[i].alt));
        } else if (parent && parent.tagName.toLowerCase() === "div" && parent.className === "math") {
          span = img[i].parentNode.appendChild(document.createElement("span"));
          span.style.display = "none";
          span.appendChild(document.createTextNode(img[i].alt));
        }
      }
    }
  };
  
  if (window.addEventListener) {window.addEventListener("load",PREPROCESS,false)}
  else if (window.attachEvent) {window.attachEvent("onload",PREPROCESS)}
  else {window.onload = PREPROCESS}
})();


```
