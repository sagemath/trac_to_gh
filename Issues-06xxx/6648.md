This patch add's Riemann mapping functionality to sage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_mapping_theorem

It can compute numerical maps and has multiple utilities for plotting/visualizing the maps.

It also includes 2 functions to parametrically interpolate lists of complex points. This makes it far easier for the user to define the boundary of the figure that they wish to Riemann map. 

NOTE: This may require the cython 0.11.2spkg to compile.

EDIT: There was a problem with one of my interpolation equations, fixed it + tests. New patch is below first one.

EDIT: More minor fixes, new patch.

EDIT: Again, new patch

That's a problem with sage's cython version. You need to update to 0.11.2. 
According to Mike Hanson:

" There is a ticket to update Cython in Sage at
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/6438.  If you download
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/cython-0.11.2.spkg
and run "sage -f /path/to/cython-0.11.2.spkg", then Cython 0.11.2 will
be used.

I applied only the 2nd patch to 4.1.1.a0. It seemed to work fine trying out several examples form the docstrings by had. However, on an intel macbook running 10.4.11 there were several failures of sage -testall:

```
        sage -t  "devel/sage/doc/en/bordeaux_2008/birds_other.rst"

        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/parallel/decorate.py"
        sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx"
```

Some of these are probably spurious but some are not:

I'm not sure about the ps.value failure, that does look like numerical noise. The cs ones were my mistake when creating the new patch. There's yet another version up now that should *fingers crossed* work better. 

The whole package is highly dependent on numerical methods, so noise wouldn't surprise me, but maybe it should.

Hmm... It runs fine for me, intel t3200, ubuntu 9.04

I'm afraid I'm not knowledgeable enough to pinpoint the exact source of the differences. Is there some sort of flag that can make the test routine ignore numerical differences of a certain size?

Is there some other way that it should be fixed?

Yes there is such a "flag" but I am the wrong person to ask! I would ask Carl Witty, if you can get a hold of him. If that fails, just post to sage-support something about keeping track of numerical noise doctest failures.

This patch needs work:

Also, should these files be added to the reference manual?

From a quick look it seems that this should be added to the basic reference manual, but nowhere else. I'm on vacation now, so those edits may take a bit. I'll probably put them in a separate patch.

I assume that patches should be merged in this order:

1. `12659.5.patch`
2. `12660.patch`

These patches apply OK against Sage 4.1.1, with `12660.patch` resulting in some fuzz:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/6648/12660.patch && hg qpush
adding 12660.patch to series file
applying 12660.patch
patching file module_list.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 125 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
patching file sage/calculus/all.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 20 with fuzz 2 (offset 4 lines).
Now at: 12660.patch
```
Don't worry about the fuzz. However, building the reference manual results in 17 warnings:

Alright, I'm back to working on this again.
Questions:

How far should I tell the doctests to ignore the numerical noise? 
Is there some point where I should start trying to track down and fix the cause? 
Is that even possible?

Should I be worried about the reference manual compilation warnings?

**Referee Report**



I have attached the reviewer patch `trac_6648-reviewer.patch`. My changes include:

1. Proper ReST formatting to resolve dozens of warnings when building the HTML version of the reference manual.
2. Fix various typos.
3. Some formatting of the docstrings to keep them less than 80 characters wide. Beyond 80 characters, the docstring can be difficult to read from the command line interface.
4. Proper formatting of code so it conforms to Python coding conventions as covered in the [Developers' Guide](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html#python-coding-conventions).
5. In the file `sage/calculus/riemann.pyx`, don't redefine `xrange`, which is a built-in command of Python. Instead, define `x_range` and similarly define `y_range`. Also, don't use the name `list` as a parameter to the function `comp_pt()` because `list` is the name of the Python function for creating a list data structure. I have changed it to `clist` instead.
6. For the file `sage/calculus/riemann.pyx`, in the `__init__()` method of the class `Riemann_Map`, I changed the test

 ```
 if <= 2:
     ...
 ```
 to raise an exception instead. That is, if the number of collocations points is less than 3, then you don't want to proceed any further with initializing the `Riemann_Map` object.


You should apply patches in this order:

1. `12659.5.patch`
2. `12660.patch`
3. `trac_6648-reviewer.patch`
 
The reviewer patch should resolve doctest failures and reference manual build warnings that I reported above. So my patch needs some reviewing. Also, here are some required changes once patches are applied in the above order:

1. In the file `sage/calculus/riemann.pyx`, you need to explain what the function `_render_on_subplot` does.
2. Also, you need to explain the purpose of the class `ColorPlot` and provide examples in the docstring of that class.
3. In the file `sage/calculus/interpolators.pyx`, explain the purpose of the class `PSpline` and provide examples in the docstring of that class.
4. Explain the purpose of the class `CCSpline` and provide examples in its docstring.

Ok, I've put up a patch that fixes the missing documentation. Note that the relatively sparse documentation in the ColorPlot and _render_on_subplot is more than exists in the complex_plot module from which I obtained the code.

At this point all that is required is some kind knowledgeable soul to implement dump/load functionality so that the modules can pass the TestSuite requirement. Alternately direct me to a resource that provides an in depth tutorial on how to implement it. I appreciate all the help so far, and I would really like to get this published. If there's anything that I can do to speed it up, let me know.

I'm excited to explore this functionality and show it to a fellow faculty member who does projects with students in complex analysis.

Things could probably be sped up quite a bit if the class used fast_callable to "compile" the functions.  For example:

```
sage: ff=fast_callable(e^(I*t),domain=CDF,vars=['t'])
sage: gg=fast_callable(I*e^(I*t),domain=CDF,vars=['t'])
sage: %time m = Riemann_Map([ff], [gg], 0, 1000)
CPU times: user 2.44 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 2.56 s
Wall time: 2.57 s
sage: %time m = Riemann_Map([lambda t: e^(I*t)], [lambda t: I*e^(I*t)], 0, 1000) 
CPU times: user 21.25 s, sys: 0.25 s, total: 21.50 s
Wall time: 23.13 s
```

Notice that the fast_callable version is an order of magnitude faster.

I don't think this patch ought to be delayed for this, but it would be a good additional ticket to speed up this functionality quite a bit by using fast_callable.
