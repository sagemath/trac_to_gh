This patch add's Riemann mapping functionality to sage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_mapping_theorem

It can compute numerical maps and has multiple utilities for plotting/visualizing the maps.

It also includes 2 functions to parametrically interpolate lists of complex points. This makes it far easier for the user to define the boundary of the figure that they wish to Riemann map. 

NOTE: This may require the cython 0.11.2spkg to compile.

EDIT: There was a problem with one of my interpolation equations, fixed it + tests. New patch is below first one.

EDIT: More minor fixes, new patch.

EDIT: Again, new patch

That's a problem with sage's cython version. You need to update to 0.11.2. 
According to Mike Hanson:

" There is a ticket to update Cython in Sage at
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/6438.  If you download
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/cython/cython-0.11.2.spkg
and run "sage -f /path/to/cython-0.11.2.spkg", then Cython 0.11.2 will
be used.

Some of these are probably spurious but some are not:

The following tests failed:

This looks like numerical noise but I'm not sure. In any case, it is in a file you modified, so it
is probably not spurious.

I assume that patches should be merged in this order:

1. `12659.5.patch`
2. `12660.patch`

These patches apply OK against Sage 4.1.1, with `12660.patch` resulting in some fuzz:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-main]$ hg qimport https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6648/12660.patch.gz && hg qpush
adding 12660.patch to series file
applying 12660.patch
patching file module_list.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 125 with fuzz 2 (offset 8 lines).
patching file sage/calculus/all.py
Hunk #1 succeeded at 20 with fuzz 2 (offset 4 lines).
Now at: 12660.patch
```
Don't worry about the fuzz. However, building the reference manual results in 17 warnings:

Two crucial doctests are missing:

Alright, I'm back to working on this again.
Questions:

How far should I tell the doctests to ignore the numerical noise? 
Is there some point where I should start trying to track down and fix the cause? 
Is that even possible?

Should I be worried about the reference manual compilation warnings?

I have attached the reviewer patch `trac_6648-reviewer.patch`. My changes include:

2. Fix various typos.
3. Some formatting of the docstrings to keep them less than 80 characters wide. Beyond 80 characters, the docstring can be difficult to read from the command line interface.

Thank you Minh. 
I will happily put up another patch with the doc additions you suggested. However, exams are starting for me, so I probably won't be able to get around to it for 2 weeks or so.

In addition, it's not clear to me that your patch fixes the primary problem, namely that the class doesn't know how to dump/save itself, and therefore wont pass the TestSuite test. Fixing that is outside my abilities.

Ok, I've put up a patch that fixes the missing documentation. Note that the relatively sparse documentation in the ColorPlot and _render_on_subplot is more than exists in the complex_plot module from which I obtained the code.

At this point all that is required is some kind knowledgeable soul to implement dump/load functionality so that the modules can pass the TestSuite requirement.

<a id='comment:36'>**Comment 36:**</a>
I'm excited to explore this functionality and show it to a fellow faculty member who does projects with students in complex analysis.

Things could probably be sped up quite a bit if the class used fast_callable to "compile" the functions.  For example:

```
sage: ff=fast_callable(e^(I*t),domain=CDF,vars=['t'])
sage: gg=fast_callable(I*e^(I*t),domain=CDF,vars=['t'])
sage: %time m = Riemann_Map([ff], [gg], 0, 1000)
CPU times: user 2.44 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 2.56 s
Wall time: 2.57 s
sage: %time m = Riemann_Map([lambda t: e^(I*t)], [lambda t: I*e^(I*t)], 0, 1000) 
CPU times: user 21.25 s, sys: 0.25 s, total: 21.50 s
Wall time: 23.13 s
```

Notice that the fast_callable version is an order of magnitude faster.

I don't think this patch ought to be delayed for this, but it would be a good additional ticket to speed up this functionality quite a bit by using fast_callable.

Good point Jason.

Starting next fall I plan to develop this further as my senior project in math and CS. I have several ideas planned including parallelization and fast-callable. However, if it would be helpful to have it sooner rather than later, I have no problem doing some basic work now (or having someone else do it if that is preferred).
