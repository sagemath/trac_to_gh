```
Add method `key_space()` to the following classes:

* `sage.crypto.classical.HillCryptosystem`

* `sage.crypto.classical.SubstitutionCryptosystem`

* `sage.crypto.classical.TranspositionCryptosystem`

* `sage.crypto.classical.VigenereCryptosystem`

The new method `key_space()` should output the number of possible keys for each of the above cryptosystems.

Keywords: **key space, classical cryptosystems**

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
As far as I can tell, these have been implemented since forever. For example: 

```
sage: S = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: H = HillCryptosystem(S,3)
sage: H.key_space()
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Ring of integers modulo 26
```    

Similar results can be produced for all other ciphers mentioned. This is either inherited from SymmetricKeyCryptosystem or is overridden in the init methods.

I marked this as wont fix because it's implemented at least as of 6.4. In 6.7 The following works

```
    sage: S = HillCryptosystem(AlphabeticStrings(),3)
    sage: S.key_space()
    Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Ring of integers modulo 26

    sage: S = SubstitutionCryptosystem(AlphabeticStrings())
    sage: S.key_space()
    Free alphabetic string monoid on A-Z

    sage: S = TranspositionCryptosystem(AlphabeticStrings(),2)
    sage: S.key_space()
    Symmetric group of order 2! as a permutation group

    sage: S = VigenereCryptosystem(AlphabeticStrings(), 2)
    sage: S.key_space()
    Free alphabetic string monoid on A-Z
```
