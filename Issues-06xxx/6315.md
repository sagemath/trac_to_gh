Why not just append "`, random output`" to "`#optional - magma`"? That way, the output is ignored, just like the timings in this rst file that don't use magma.

Are the authors of the book aware of this error?

The authors "= me" is aware now.  I've posted a part2 patch that puts ...'s in for the timings, explains that the doctest is showing the reader *how* to compare timings with Magma (which is good to know how to do easily), and remarks that in fact the timings may change over time.
