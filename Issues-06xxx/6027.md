sage: timeit('get_memory_usage()')
5 loops, best of 3: 486 ms per loop
```
This causes sage/rings/tests.py to take forever in -long doctesting mode.

See http://blog.kuriositaet.de/?p=257 for a more efficient way to get the current memory used.

**Attachment:** [trac_6027_get_memory_usage_darwin.patch.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket6027/trac_6027_get_memory_usage_darwin.patch.gz)

I've added a patch to get the memory usage of Sage on Darwin without spawning top and parsing the output. With this patch, get_memory_usage() will still report the same result that top reports for VSIZE (the link above doesn't do this).

Before patch:

sage: timeit('get_memory_usage()')
5 loops, best of 3: 156 ms per loop

After patch:

sage: timeit('get_memory_usage()')
125 loops, best of 3: 2.62 ms per loop

This has only been tested on OS X 10.5, Intel, 64-bit. It will likely work for PPC and 32-bit (still 10.5), but I'm not sure about 10.4 and earlier. I don't have access to hardware right now to test (and fix) this patch on all these other configurations. I'd be happy to finish up this patch if someone has machines to test on.

I have no doubt it will compile, so mark it for "needs review". Otherwise no one will look at this any time soon since those tickets tend to stay rotten in trac ;)

Once I have made it home I will look at this. I have some analog code for Solaris more or less ready to go and will extend this code as needed then.

Cheers,

Michael

This isn't critical for 4.0.  This would be very nice to get into 4.0.1.
