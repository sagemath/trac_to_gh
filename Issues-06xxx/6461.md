This is a follow-up to #6164. The goal here is to implement the S-DES block cipher of Schaefer as described in the paper:

E. Schaefer. A simplified data encryption algorithm. Cryptologia, 20(1):77--84, 1996.

This is a simplified variant of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be used for cryptography education.

**Review**:

* I assume that the specification implemented is correct, I didn't check against the paper, are there official test vectors?
* The code looks good and is nicely documented (coverage: 100%)
* `__cmp__` expects you to return an integer (-1,0,1) and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html
*  it is a bit confusing that P is often the plaintext (cf. C for ciphertext) and the permutation, but that might be a problem in the paper
* it would be nice to have an `sbox(n)` function to return the S-Boxes 0 and 1
* patch applies cleanly against 4.1.
* reference manual builds without warnings and the result looks okay.
* doctests pass on sage.math

Bottomline: positive review except some nitpicks.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to the original paper by Schaefer, and neither do my institution. I relied on the note at

http://bitterroot.vancouver.wsu.edu/cs427_Spring09/docs/sdes.pdf




> * `__cmp__` expects you to return an integer (-1,0,1) and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html

Before switching to using `__cmp__()`, I used `==` for comparing objects. But then doing `a == loads(dumps(a))` consistently returned `False` for me. Let me try it again.



> *  it is a bit confusing that P is often the plaintext (cf. C for ciphertext) and the permutation, but that might be a problem in the paper

Ah... the notes I referenced above uses `IP` to denote the initial permutation and `IP^-1` for its inverse. Perhaps that is less confusing you think?



>    * it would be nice to have an `sbox(n)` function to return the S-Boxes 0 and 1

That can be done.

There are no official test vectors for simplified DES. Even the original paper by Schaefer doesn't contain any such vectors.




> * `__cmp__` expects you to return an integer (-1,0,1) and not `True` or `False`, cf. http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html

The latest patch `trac_6461-sdes.patch` now uses `__eq__()`. I have also modified the class `MiniAES` in `sage/crypto/block_cipher/miniaes.py` so it now also uses `__eq__()`.




> * it would be nice to have an `sbox(n)` function to return the S-Boxes 0 and 1

Done.
