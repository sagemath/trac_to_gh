The failures here were caused mainly by `unramified_outside` ordering its output.  Presumably the doctests weren't updated when the ordering was introduced.

Sorting the list of fields is a good idea, but the existing ordering was essentially random.  In the patch I've fixed it so that the fields are ordered primarily by degree and discriminant, and done the same for the other main function `ramified_at`.  The doctests have been adjusted accordingly.

At the same time the opportunity has been taken to tidy up a few things.  In particular I have included a check that the 'primes' are indeed prime.

Merged both patches. However, I notice that some docstrings in `trac_6332.patch` aren't properly formatted. In particular:

```
164	        -  ``var'' - the name used for the generator of the number fields (default 'a').
