The file sage-README-osx.txt is very confusing. If someone downloads the source, the readme file indicates they have downloaded binaries. 

There should perhaps be two README files - one for source, and one for binaries.

See also #5296.

By the way, I see two copies of the file "sage-README-osx.txt": 

- in the top-level directory: this one should be present in a binary distribution on OS X, not otherwise.
- in SAGE_ROOT/local/bin.  This one should be deleted.  It doesn't seem to be tracked by Mercurial, so it needs to be removed by hand.

Hmm.  But if both of these are not present in a source distribution, then where will it come from when sage -bdist is run?  It has to be somewhere, right?

Oh yeah, this one is needed for sage-bdist - see line 92:

```
    cp sage/local/bin/sage-README-osx.txt README.txt
```
But the one on the top level should be able to be safely removed, given that line in sage-bdist, methinks.  Whether the one in /local/bin should overwrite the usual README.txt is another question.  

Incidentally, the usual README.txt maybe should be updated - for instance, Mac OS X is essentially fully supported now, correct?  And Fortran is now only included for OS X, not Linux, I believe. 

Anyway, the correct course of action for this ticket is to remove the (untracked?) top-level OSX README file, as far as I can tell.  How does one review this?

One option might be to have a file ".README-OSX-binary.txt" for information about binaries, and README-OSX.txt for information about source. Then if one runs sage -bdist, it replace README-OSX.txt with .README-OSX-binary.txt

The fact the file starts with a dot, would tend to make it less obvious. Or perhaps have one file, but make it a bit clearer what is relevant to those using a binary distribution, and what is relevant to those using a source distribution.

That was my whole point about using a dot - it would not be found easily. 

If the information only relevant to those using a binary distribution was in a file starting with dot in the sources, then it would not be too obvious to those looking at the sources. 

It would only become apparent on a binary distribution, because the act of running 'sage -bdist' would have removed the dot.

It's one option, but I suspect a simpler one is to just have the one file be a bit more explicit about what is relevant to a source distribution, and what is relevant to a binary distribution. 

I'm not overly concerned whether it is done in one file, two files, or whether any files are semi-hidden by the use of a dot in front of their name. But the current version is rather confusing.

I'll give this a positive review.  To the release manager: delete the file sage-README-osx.txt in the top directory.

I think doing this won't have any effect on #9433.  If #9433 gets merged first, on the other hand, then this should automatically be taken care of.
