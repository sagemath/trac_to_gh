The new `scipy-0.7.spkg` from #3391 is great -- except that it accidentally forgets to include a fix to `scipy.optimize.optimize` if `gfortran` is used instead of `g95`. There's a new spkg up that fixes that here (on sage.math):

  /scratch/craigcitro/patches/scipy-0.7.p1.spkg 

Indeed, I spoke with Jason Grout, and he confirmed that the new `optimize.py` should be patched in regardless of what fortran compiler we use.

I'm adding a few potential reviewers to the cc.

Oh, I should say: I've tested this on both `sage.math` and `cleo` on skynet, which uses `gfortran` -- it worked fine in both cases.
