The delaunay packages appears to be the same, with just some name changes.

But the mpmath while providing the same feature, has a significant large amount of patches.

In either case, if patching sage to use sympy/mpmath and mpatplotlib/delaunay, the doctests works, but there may exit some special reason to use mpmath instead of sympy/mpmath.

Many thanks for the reply. I was unsure if I should create a mandriva package for mpmath, or assume it was unintended duplication of code. I even just updated the mpmath patch to also use sympy.mpmath from sage/libs/mpmath/utils.pyx

I will add a python-mpmath package to mandriva, and revert the patch to use sympy.mpmath from my rpm. Guess for now it will also have duplicated %py_platsitedir/sympy/mpath and %py_platsitedir/mpath, what may be a source of confusion...
