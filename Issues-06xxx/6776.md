This patch allows to

- use plot3d for 1- and 2-dimensional polytopes

- specify different colors for different facets

- specify labels for vertices other than their numbers

```
sage: lattice_polytope.octahedron(2).plot3d(vlabels=["A", "B", "C", "D"])
sage: o = lattice_polytope.octahedron(3)
sage: o.plot3d(facet_colors=sage.plot.plot.rainbow(o.nfacets(), 'rgbtuple'))
```

The positioning of labels is slightly improved 0 they are now shifted away from the barycenter of the polytope, not just the origin.

I do have one comment about the vertex labels - if the vertex is at the barycenter, then it isn't shifted at all and the label is right on top of the vertex point.  Since its not directly addressed by this patch I don't think that should affect this review though.

Also, someday soon the polytope code should be unified (i.e. in polyhedra.py and lattice_polytope.py) and refactored.  There are so many functions in both that depend on dimension I think it does make sense to have a polytope-factory class with dimension-specific subclasses.
