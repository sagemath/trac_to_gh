It seems there is little remaining to do for iterators in backends now, so let's do it.

Before

```
sage: a = DiGraph(graphs.CompleteGraph(100))
sage: b = a._backend
sage: %timeit L = list(b.iterator_nbrs(30))
28.3 µs ± 1.44 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

After

```
sage: a = DiGraph(graphs.CompleteGraph(100))
sage: b = a._backend
sage: %timeit L = list(b.iterator_nbrs(30))
18.6 µs ± 698 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
```

Failed example:
    list(D.neighbor_iterator(0))
Expected:
    [1, 2, 3]
Got:
    [3, 1, 2]
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 17591, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.?
Failed example:
    list(D.depth_first_search(1, ignore_direction=True, edges=True))
Expected:
    [(1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 2), (4, 3)]
Got:
    [(1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 2)]
```
This one I am not sure if it is because of the random seed or this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --random-seed=210304412354021215508062896360889570175 src/sage/schemes/toric/sheaf/klyachko.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/schemes/toric/sheaf/klyachko.py", line 950, in sage.schemes.toric.sheaf.klyachko.KlyachkoBundle_class.random_deformation
Failed example:
    Vtilde.cohomology(dim=True, weight=(0,))
Expected:
    (1, 0)
Got:
    (0, 0)
```
in either case, it should be a trivial fix.

I fixed the doctests in `generic_graph.py`. 

I cannot reproduce the error in `klyachko.py`. It occurs in method `random_deformation`. Some help might be helpful here.
