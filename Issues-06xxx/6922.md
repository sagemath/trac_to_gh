In Sage, I am trying to construct a polynomial ring with matrix
ordering. 
....
AFAIK, it is not implemented, but I think that some people were
working on it.

It is in fact one of the things that I miss in Sage's polynomial rings
(the other thing are supercommutative rings), so that I need to use
the Singular interface rather than libsingular. 
....
Anyway it will be great that the matrix ordering is included in Sage
natively.

I agree partially. Should we follow the Singular syntax exactly? For short syntax, how about just "m(1,3,1,0)"? I personally think the Singular syntax for term ordering is somewhat cryptic.

I think it is better for Sage to support both the string description and `TermOrder` description. Thus for examples,

```
order='m(1,3,1,0)'+'deglex(2)'
```

```
order='m(1,3,1,0),deglex(3)'
```

for a square matrix m,

```
order=TermOrder(m)+TermOrder('deglex',3)
```

are all supported.

Marshall Hampton says:

I agree with John that Simon's example:

```
  sage: M = Matrix(2,2, [1,3,1,0])
  sage: R.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order=TermOrder(M)
+TermOrder('deglex',3))
```

looks good and reasonably intuitive to me.

This description is a mix of Singular syntax and Sage string syntax. I would like to avoid Sage string syntax as much as possible.

Sorry for being a bit obnoxious about it, but shouldn't this be needs work until it works across the board? At least we should fall back to the `PolyDict` version automatically if a matrix term ordering is selected or something.

The patch applies cleanly and doctests pass.

I'm still not happy with the interface:

```python
sage: P.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(GF(32003),order=TermOrder(Matrix([1,2,0,3])))
sage: P.term_order()
m(1,2,0,3) term order
```

This uses the non-standard "m(...)" representation which I would avoid. I'd be happy with either "M()" (Singular notation) or "Matrix term ordering with matrix ..." or so.

Also, the "m()" notation is allowed but shouldn't.

```python
sage: P.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(GF(32003),order='m(1,2,0,3)')
```

I understand that this is a typical paint-the-bike-shed scenario and in particular a question of choice. Still, I think we shouldn't invent more ad-hoc string notation when (a) there is an established notation and (b) we have a much nicer object oriented way of constructing term orderings.

However, since this isn't really that big of a deal, I am okay with being overruled by some other referee who disagrees.

PS: Apologies for taking so long to revisit this ticket.

Patch looks good (small issue see below), applies cleanly, doctests pass.

So, this stuff now works, very cool:

```python
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(127),2,'x',order=Matrix([1,2,0,3]))
sage: P.term_order()
Matrix term order with matrix
[1 2]
[0 3]
sage: magma(P)
Polynomial ring of rank 2 over GF(127)
Order: Weight [full]
Variables: x0, x1
sage: singular(P)
//   characteristic : 127
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering M
//                  : names    x0 x1
//                  : weights   1  2
//                  : weights   0  3
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

I've attached a small referee patch which Kwankyu or someone else has to sign of. Kwankyu's patch gets a positive review modulo the issue in the referee patch.
