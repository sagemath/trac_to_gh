In Sage, I am trying to construct a polynomial ring with matrix
ordering. 
....
AFAIK, it is not implemented, but I think that some people were
working on it.

It is in fact one of the things that I miss in Sage's polynomial rings
(the other thing are supercommutative rings), so that I need to use
the Singular interface rather than libsingular. 
....
Anyway it will be great that the matrix ordering is included in Sage
natively. 

**Assignee:** Somebody

**CC:**  @novoselt

I don't think we should support the 'matrix()' syntax. The Singular syntax is 'M()' which we should support for compatibility and familiarity. However, adding another string expression does not seem to make sense, because we will be able to simply write `order=A` where A is an integer matrix which is much more python-ic.

I agree partially. Should we follow the Singular syntax exactly? For short syntax, how about just "m(1,3,1,0)"? I personally think the Singular syntax for term ordering is somewhat cryptic.

I think it is better for Sage to support both the string description and `TermOrder` description. Thus for examples,

```
order='m(1,3,1,0)'+'deglex(2)'
```

```
order='m(1,3,1,0),deglex(3)'
```

for a square matrix m,

```
order=TermOrder(m)+TermOrder('deglex',3)
```

are all supported.

Marshall Hampton says:

I agree with John that Simon's example:

```
  sage: M = Matrix(2,2, [1,3,1,0])
  sage: R.<a,b,c,d,e,f> = PolynomialRing(QQ, order=TermOrder(M)
+TermOrder('deglex',3))
```

looks good and reasonably intuitive to me.

This description is a mix of Singular syntax and Sage string syntax. I would like to avoid Sage string syntax as much as possible.

I like this best.

Yep, that's what I would be aiming for.

* `NotImplementedError, "Singular engine in Sage cannot handle matrix ordering yet."` should be replaced by `NotImplementedError("Matrix term orderings are not supported by the libSingular interface yet."` or something along those lines. I propose this change to make it clearer that Singular can indeed deal with Matrix term orderings and that it is us who cannot.
  * `TypeError: Cannot use a matrix term order as a block.` shouldn't that be a `NotImplementedError`?
  * I thought the agreement was not to allow 'matrix(0,1,2,3)' but to use Singular's convention instead? It seems you are allowing at and using it internally.

The patch applies cleanly and doctests pass.

I'm still not happy with the interface:

```python
sage: P.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(GF(32003),order=TermOrder(Matrix([1,2,0,3])))
sage: P.term_order()
m(1,2,0,3) term order
```

This uses the non-standard "m(...)" representation which I would avoid. I'd be happy with either "M()" (Singular notation) or "Matrix term ordering with matrix ..." or so.

Also, the "m()" notation is allowed but shouldn't.

```python
sage: P.<a,b> = PolynomialRing(GF(32003),order='m(1,2,0,3)')
```

I understand that this is a typical paint-the-bike-shed scenario and in particular a question of choice. Still, I think we shouldn't invent more ad-hoc string notation when (a) there is an established notation and (b) we have a much nicer object oriented way of constructing term orderings.

However, since this isn't really that big of a deal, I am okay with being overruled by some other referee who disagrees.

PS: Apologies for taking so long to revisit this ticket.

Patch looks good (small issue see below), applies cleanly, doctests pass.

So, this stuff now works, very cool:

```python
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(127),2,'x',order=Matrix([1,2,0,3]))
sage: P.term_order()
Matrix term order with matrix
[1 2]
[0 3]
sage: magma(P)
Polynomial ring of rank 2 over GF(127)
Order: Weight [full]
Variables: x0, x1
sage: singular(P)
//   characteristic : 127
//   number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering M
//                  : names    x0 x1
//                  : weights   1  2
//                  : weights   0  3
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

I've attached a small referee patch which Kwankyu or someone else has to sign of. Kwankyu's patch gets a positive review modulo the issue in the referee patch.
