The class `SubstitutionCryptosystem` accepts keys whose values are alphabetic characters. We should implement a method to allow a key
to be converted between alphabetic characters and numerical values. For example, here is what I have in mind:

```
sage: A = AlphabeticStrings()
sage: S = SubstitutionCryptosystem(A)
sage: key = S.random_key()
ABC
sage: S.alphabet_to_numbers(key)
012
sage: S.numbers_to_alphabet([0, 1, 2])
ABC
```
Generalizing from this, we can also have methods to do the following conversions:

* from alphabetic characters to binary values and vice versa

* from alphabetic characters to hexadecimal values and vice versa

* from alphabetic characters to mod 26 values and vice versa

* from alphabetic characters to ASCII values and vice versa

Keywords: **substitution cryptosystem**

Reviewer: **Travis Scholl**

Component: **cryptography**
