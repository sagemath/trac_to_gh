In new symbolics, imaginary 'I' is typeset as 'I' which is not "textbook style". This is a regression compared to Sage 3.4

```
sage: latex( exp(i*x))
e^{I \, x}
```

Lower case letter 'i' should be used in the typeset version.

Complex I in new symbolics is nothing but a quadratic number field element.

Robert, any thoughts on how to handle this?
