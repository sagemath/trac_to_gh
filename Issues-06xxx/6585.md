This patch changes a few docstrings in partition.py which contain backslashes from

```
"""
blah
"""
```
to

```
r"""
blah
"""
```
(I've been playing with version 0.6.2 of Sphinx, and it barfs without making this change.)

Positive review for the patch `trac_6585-backslash.patch`. After importing the changes in that patch and rebuilding the HTML version of the reference manual, I got the following warning:

```
WARNING: /scratch/mvngu/release/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/partition.py:docstring of sage.combinat.partition.Partition_class.conjugate:1: (WARNING/2) Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```
This is fixed by `trac_6585-fix-warnings.patch`. Merged both patches.
