If the file "r_commandlist.sobj" under $DOT_SAGE is missing, the first time you run a doctest over "r.py", you'll get:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"                  
**********************************************************************
File "/Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py", line 838:

Expected:
    ['testPlatformEquivalence', 'testVirtual']
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Building R command completion list (this takes
    a few seconds only the first time you do it).
    To force rebuild later, delete /Users/georgweber/.sage//r_commandlist.sobj.

**********************************************************************
1 items had failures:
   1 of   3 in __main__.example_34
***Test Failed*** 1 failures.
For whitespace errors, see the file /Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.1.1.alpha0/tmp/.doctest_r.py
```
or some error message closely related. If you run the doctest a second time, the failure vanishes, since the file in $DOT_SAGE had been built. But that is not something one wants to happen during doctesting.
