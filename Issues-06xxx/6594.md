If the file "r_commandlist.sobj" under $DOT_SAGE is missing, the first time you run a doctest over "r.py", you'll get:

```
sage -t  "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/r.py"                  
**********************************************************************

Expected:

Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Building R command completion list (this takes
    a few seconds only the first time you do it).
    To force rebuild later, delete /Users/georgweber/.sage//r_commandlist.sobj.

***Test Failed*** 1 failures.

```
or some error message closely related. If you run the doctest a second time, the failure vanishes, since the file in $DOT_SAGE had been built. But that is not something one wants to happen during doctesting.

Doctesting r.py after (if it there at all) deleting the file $HOME/.sage/r_commandlist.sobj will always fail --- unless one has this patch applied. So I hope it is a very easy review.
