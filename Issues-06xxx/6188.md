I reviewed David's patch by rebuilding the reference manual and looking through the relavant sections.  I found quite a few more things needing tidying up (several in functions I wrote, so my fault), hence the second patch nearly half as large as the first.

I'm happy to OK David's contribution, but someone else (David?) should run mine.  It's all docstring changes, but I did check that all tests in sage/rings/number_field still pass.
