I switched spol from a lambda definition to a documented function, since it seems important enough in this module.  I also cleaned up a few things for the reference manual formatting (OUTPUT sections were in bold, for example, unintentionally).

Martin Albrect (malb) should get both contributor and reviewer credit for this, I think.  But now that I have made a new version, I think it is appropriate that he reviews again (hopefully for a final time).
