Example:

```
sage: G=DirichletGroup(5); X=G.list(); Y=X[0]; Z=X[1] 
sage: # Y is trivial and Z is quartic
sage: sum([Y(x)*Z(1-x) for x in IntegerModRing(5)])
 -1
sage: # The value -1 above is the correct value of the Jacobi sum J(Y, Z).
sage: Y.jacobi_sum(Z);    Z.jacobi_sum(Y)
0
0
sage: #The 0 values above are incorrect values of J(Y, Z).
```
