1. Implement a single entry point for recursively enumerated sets:

```
     RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, successors, structure=..., enumeration=...)
```

where `structure` takes values in the set `[None, 'forest', 'graded', 'symmetric']` and `enumeration` takes values in the set `[None, 'depth', 'breadth', 'naive']`.

2. Deprecate `TransitiveIdeal`, `TransitiveIdealGraded` and `SearchForest` as entry point.

3. `TransitiveIdeal(succ, seeds)` keeps the same behavior as before and is now the same as `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='naive')`.

4. `TransitiveIdealGraded(succ, seeds, max_depth)` keeps the same behavior as before and is now the same as `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds, succ, structure=None, enumeration='breadth', max_depth=max_depth)`.

Remarks:

A. For now the code of `SearchForest` is still in `sage/combinat/backtrack.py`. It should be moved in `sage/sets/recursively_enumerated_set.pyx`. See #16351.

B. `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIealGraded` are used in the code of `sage/combinat`, `sage/categories` and `sage/groups` at least. These should be updated to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` for speed improvements and also to avoid issues explained in C below. See #16352.

C. Note that there were some issues with `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded`, namely:

   - Enumeration of `TransitiveIdeal` is claimed to be depth first search in the top level file `backtrack.py`, but in fact, it is neither breadth first neither depth first. It is what I call a naive search.
   - Enumeration of `TransitiveIdealGraded` is indeed breadth first as claimed but it does not make use of the graded hypothesis at all because it remembers every generated elements.

In a tentative to find good choices for name and so on, here is how I see this.

- Let X be a set.
- Let R be a binary relation on X, that is R is a subset of the cartesian product of X times X.
- Denote by xRy if x is R-related to y.

Now

- Let `seeds` be a subset of X.
- Let `succ` be a callable python object `X -> 2^X` such that xRy if and only if y is in `succ(x)`.

We are interested in the subset S of X that can be generated from the `seeds` using the `succ` recursively. More precisely in the set 

 S = {y : x = x1 R x2 R x3 R ... R xn = y and x in `seeds`}.

Moreover, we are interested in the enumeration of S itself and we consider depth-first and breadth-first as different and both usefull.

Such a relation G = (X,R) can be seen as a directed graph. I think this remark is useful as it may provide some vocabulary. Indeed the set S is the connected components of the generators in the digraph G.

I see some different cases :

**1. We do not know anything more about the relation.** We need to save in memory all the `known` objects to avoid duplicates. This is what is currently done in `TransitiveIdeal` (depth-first search) and (curiously) in `TransitiveIdealGraded` (breadth-first search) also.

**2. The directed graph S is a forest with given `seeds`.** Equivalently, one may say that S do not contain cycle (oriented or not). This is what is currently done in `SearchForest`.

**3. The relation is graded.** By graded here I mean what I thought `TransitiveIdealGraded` was doing until I look more carefully at the doc and the code. More seriously, by graded I mean the following : for all (x1 in seeds) and (y1 in seeds), 

  if (x1 R x2 R ... R xn) and (y1 R y2 R ... R ym) and (xn=ym), then (n=m).

The relation is graded if all path from the origin to an element have the same length. In this case, we only need to save in memory the current level.

**4. The relation is symmetric.** If the relation is symmetric, we only need to keep in memory the last two level of depth. This is what I needed and coded this week. And this is why I started to look more carefully at the code in `sage/combinat/backtrack.py`...

That is it for now!

I think `relation` would not be too bad for the name of the successor keyword and should be considered as well. In some sense, a binary relation is a function `f: X -> 2^X` and a function is a relation such that `|f(x)|=1` for all x.

Possibilities for successor keyword :

- `succ` : suitable for non symmetric relation, currently used in `TransitiveIdeal` and `TransitiveIdealGraded`
- `successors`
- `operators`
- `neighbors` : suitable vocabulary for symmetric relation
- `children` : suitable vocabulary for non symmetric relation, currently used in `SearchForest`.
- `relatives` : suitable vocabulary for symmetric relation

Possibilities for generators keyword :

- `generators`
- `gens`
- `roots`
- `seeds`

RecursiveSet(seeds, succ)
RecursiveSet(seeds, succ, structure="forest")
RecursiveSet(seeds, succ, structure="graded")
RecursiveSet(seeds, succ, structure="symmetric")

Indeed, there is some gain. I did one example:

Python:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]
CPU times: user 5.82 s, sys: 239 ms, total: 6.06 s
Wall time: 6.07 s
```

Cython:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]
CPU times: user 4.47 s, sys: 408 ms, total: 4.88 s
Wall time: 4.89 s
```

Some more speedup by doing some more cythonization. Before:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]
CPU times: user 9.68 s, sys: 147 ms, total: 9.83 s
Wall time: 9.81 s
```
With my commit:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: C = RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([10, 15], f, structure='symmetric')
sage: it = iter(C)
sage: %time L = [next(it) for _ in xrange(10^6)]
CPU times: user 8.02 s, sys: 103 ms, total: 8.13 s
Wall time: 8.15 s
```
I'm sure I haven't done the best cythonization job on this, but it works and all tests pass. If you're happy with my changes, then positive review.

Ok, now I see what you mean. When the class is `cdef`, then the `__classcall_private__` do not get called instead of the `__init__`:

```
sage: f = lambda a: [a-1,a+1]
sage: RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f)
A recursively enumerated set (depth first search)
sage: RecursivelyEnumeratedSet([0], f, structure='symmetric')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'structure'
```

I also saw in the [doc](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/misc/sage/misc/classcall_metaclass.html) that: "*For a Cython class (not cdef since they doesn’t allows metaclasses)*"

Yes exactly. I needed to play with it to understand what you meant.

> However I'm not opposed to the renaming, so I've just pushed that.


Well, the renaming was just an easy way for me to check that `sage -t recursively_enumerated_set.pyx` was ok after I realised that `__classcall_private__` was ignored by `cdef` class. It was not a suggestion, but it would not be the first renamed function:

```
sage: import_statements(sum)
from sage.misc.functional import symbolic_sum
```

So, we go with commit ​dd72bfc instead of ​3191690 ?
