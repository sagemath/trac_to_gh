It seems that in Sage 4.0.1.rc0, there is an error when I tried building the PDF version of the reference manual. The problem was reported on [sage-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/cae6eae2efb898b5). Here's a relevant snippet of the error log:

```

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.

I think this should be fixed before releasing the final version of Sage 4.1.

Here's how I went about testing the patch `trac_6474_pdf.patch`:
1. Take a copy of the compressed sage.math only binary for Sage 4.1.rc0, uncompressed it, started up Sage, quit Sage, and then do `./sage -b main`.
2. Built the HTML version of the reference manual for the main repository.
3. Made a fresh clone of the main repository and built the HTML version of the reference manual for that cloned repository.
4. Applied the patch `trac_6474_pdf.patch` to the cloned repository and rebuilt the HTML version of the reference manual.
5. Finally, I built the PDF version of the reference manual. And it built successfully.
