Nicolas? This one is quite trivial to review.

This breaks the tests in poset_examples.py, because the empty poset is a lattice but has no bottom.  I'm not sure that special casing the empty poset  is worth the less than factor of two speedup.

True, thanks for noticing that. I'll make a fix.

Speedup should be quite near to two if the poset happen to be a lattice. For me it is enought to add about 50 characters to source.

Please provide some measurements to back up your intuition.  I suspect that you are probably correct, but it is worth measuring.

After `P8=Posets(8).list()` time for


```
len([L for L in P8 if L.is_lattice()])
```


drop from 1,36 seconds to 0,63 seconds (factor more than two, which should not happen, but I guess it is random noise). And after


```
P=Posets.BooleanLattice(10)
P1=Poset(P)
```


time for


```
P1.is_lattice()
```


drops from 5,91 to 3,84 seconds.

Please, please, please, please run `make ptestlong` or `make testlong` before submitting something for review, no matter how trivial the change.  The heat death of the universe is progressing just fine by itself. In other words you are missing a pair of parentheses after cardinality. 

The fact that it runs slightly faster than twice as fast on average for all posets of size 8 is surprising at first but not unexpected  we are much faster on those posets with a bottom but no top, about the same (but very fast) for the ones with no bottom and about as fast to twice as fast for the ones with both.

Some days I think I should flush myself down the toilet.

I did the change with `()` and ran (short) tests. Then I happen to crash something and had to re-did the oneliner. And I forget the parenthesis.

> Please, please, please, please run `make ptestlong` or `make testlong` before submitting something for review, no matter how trivial the change.

Does it differ from `sage -t -a --long`? Anyways, I am now running `make ptestlong` and will mark this as needs_review after that.

There were some strange errors in compiling, maybe because of new version of Sage as a base. This is now pushed with `git -f`.

True. Of course this means nothing until we get #14110 and #17147 done.

Sorry for being snarky, I was having a bad day.

Everything looks good now.

Nothing to be sorry about. Better a co-developer to complain before change than a user to complain after.
