With a Python 3 build of Sage, `./sage -f -c nose` fails.

I'm getting this, too

I think we should be using `selftest.py` for testing with Python 3. That file says "Test the copy of nose in this directory, by running that nose against itself."

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/nose/spkg-check b/build/pkgs/nose/spkg-check
index b30f588572..cf8b772745 100644

-if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then

-fi
+./selftest.py
```

 I don't see any reason to explicitly instead run the tests in `functional_tests` or `unit_tests`. For example, files in those directories use Python 2 print syntax, while `selftest.py` tries to handle this sort of thing sensibly (by running 2to3, etc.).

This is progress, but with the change above, self-tests still fail for me:

This is an improvement, but it does not solve the problem.

A better version, but tests still fail.

Changing priority from critical to minor.

I'm marking this as "needs review". At least this way the tests actually run. They don't pass for me, but then they don't pass for me when I install `nose` as part of my system's Python 3.

Changing status from new to needs_review.
