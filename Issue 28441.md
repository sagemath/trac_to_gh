# Issue 28441: Bug in CombinatorialPolyhedron of empty Lattice polytope

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28678

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-30 19:26:18

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: lattice polytopes, combinatorial polyhedron

Currently

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3)))
```

results in a `TypeError`, as an empty list of facets is not detected as empty polyhedron.

We fix this:

```
sage: CombinatorialPolyhedron(LatticePolytope([], lattice=ToricLattice(3)))
A -1-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron with 0 facets
```
