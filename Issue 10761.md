See my comments on #10828 
I'm not saying this needs work, as it might not do, but if its anything like the matplotlib case, a lot of unnecessary files get copied. 

We should clarify this before marking this for review.

The cython docs that are copied contain just the standalone built files, not the full doc source directory.

Cython doesn't build from scratch using SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS, see also #10826.

See #11197 for building docs after sage is built.


---

See the bottom of #11197 for some other things that need to be done: add doc/ to .hgignore, and delete SPKG.txt.orig.

Here's a new spkg, based strongly on Jason's old one.  I'm attaching the patch for reference.

In the meantime Cython is version 0.15.1.

I think we're also using different syntax for checking if `SAGE_LOCAL` is defined now.
