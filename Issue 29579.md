Keywords: lmfdb, number fields

The search syntax for Number fields in the lmfdb was recently changed, which broke the function lmfdb_page for number fields, as it caused the browser to navigate to a link no long understood by the lmfdb.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29816

I think that it was hoped to include all of this code in Sage at some point, but perhaps just lifting one function is a good start!
