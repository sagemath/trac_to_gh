# Issue 29579: Fix to lmfdb_page for number fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29816

Original creator: alexjbest

Original creation time: 2020-06-06 17:52:09

Keywords: lmfdb, number fields

The search syntax for Number fields in the lmfdb was recently changed, which broke the function lmfdb_page for number fields, as it caused the browser to navigate to a link no long understood by the lmfdb.

By the way, we could also have the same thing for Dirichlet characters, maybe ?

Re: dirichlet characters: Yes that would be nice too. The lmfdb uses Conrey labels to order characters with the same conductor so some code from https://github.com/jwbober/conrey-dirichlet-characters would need to be included in Sage to do this (or the algorithms reimplemented), specifically `from_sage_character` in thatt module does the necessary calculation to produce the lmfdb label for a character.
I think that it was hoped to include all of this code in Sage at some point, but perhaps just lifting one function is a good start!
