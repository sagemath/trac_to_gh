Hi Dima,

I agree with your fixes. I took the liberty to slightly extend the scope of this ticket even more:

* Inspired by your parameter checks in `codesize_upper_bound` and `griesmer_upper_bound`, I added such a check on all the relevant functions, which throws a `ValueError` on failure.

* I fixed grammar, markup and some semantics in a number of doc-strings (I went
  through them all, but I might of course have missed some errors).

* I removed the 6 year old argument deprecation warning on some functions.

Could you review my changes?

Further, I'm actually motivated to take this opportunity to fix the other annoying thing that was brought up on sage-support: the `n, q, d` vs. `n, d, q` argument order. Let's say we agreed on `n, d, q` order - then we could in this ticket modify the relevant functions thusly:


```
def gilbert_lower_bound(n,d,q, old_params=True):
   r""" ... """
   if old_params:
      deprecation("The old parameter order `n, q, d` is deprecated and will be changed to `n, d, q`. To use the new parameter order and remove this warning, use `sage.codes.bounds.gilbert_lower_bound(n, d, q, old_params=False)`.")
      d,q = q,d
   (...)
```


After the deprecation period is over, we can remove the `if`-statement.

I can do the change if you agree. Also, do we agree that `n, d, q` is better than `n, q, d`? It seems the former is also used in the Delsarte bounds.

Best,
Johan

Thanks for looking into this. I think that the check on the parameters of `codesize_upper_bound()` introduced in [1ee9d38](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=1ee9d38a5fc003d6cad6c9faf54cbf936f6954a8) is too hard.

I will add an extra parameter to `_check_n_q_d(n, q, d)` so that the check on `q` being a prime power can be disabled, and will use it sparingly.

Good point. For the other bounds, what I know is:

* Hamming bound holds for any alphabet size.
* I think Elias holds for any size, but it is presented in e.g. Roth's Introduction to Coding Theory as an asymptotic bound. I don't know if there are caveats when using it for finite values of n and d.
* MRRW bound is like Elias, I think.
* Gilbert-Varshamov holds only for fields.
* Griesmer holds only for fields, I believe.

yes, this looks correct to me, although indeed it's mostly used to bound the 
information ratio asymptotically.

> * MRRW bound is like Elias, I think.
> * Gilbert-Varshamov holds only for fields.

from the proof given in 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Varshamov_bound
I don't see why it needs to be over a field.
There is also a section named `An improvement in the prime power case`.
(I agree it's not well-written, in the beginning they start talking about 
code over a field, only to have that section later on :-))


> * Griesmer holds only for fields, I believe.
yes.
