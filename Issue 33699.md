I was waiting for the next beta that is merged with #33922, before I start to work on this ticket.

I think many more settings in `sage_docbuild/conf.py` need to move into `sage/misc/sagedoc_conf.py`, in anticipation of #33682.

`os.environ` is used in two places: 

(1) in `skip_member()`: `skip_member()` skips problematic members of a module.

(2) in `setup()` to decide whether or not to include `skip_TESTS_block()`: `skip_TESTS_block()` skips `TESTS:` blocks.

For (1), `SAGE_CHECK_NESTED` and `SAGE_DOC_UNDERSCORE` environment variables are used

For (2), `SAGE_SKIP_TESTS_BLOCKS` environment variables is used.

If we decide on the defaults to these 3 variables, then we can remove them from `sagedoc_conf`. What would be reasonable defaults?
