the upstream issue has been fixed, it seems. At least one can get a patch.

I'd still like to leave the upgrade to a separate ticket to get this in asap and make sure it makes it to 9.5 (thus saving distros some downstream patching)

Totally agree, we had that situation too late in the release cycle for sage 9.4 with matplotlib 3.4. Let's not miss the boat this time :)

LGTM
