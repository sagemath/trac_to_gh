CC:  4ti2

For example, groebner can take a "cost" argument.

Also, there are some command-line options to activate algorithm variants;
for example, fixed-precision arithmetic for speed.

To see what's missing, one might go through the [4ti2 manual](http://www.4ti2.de/4ti2_manual.pdf) (just updated for 4ti2 version 1.6.3) and the output of "groebner --help" etc.
