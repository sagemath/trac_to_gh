Yep, sorry. I forgot to flag this as needs_review.

Regarding the old version: just have a look at the current documentation entry at http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/categories/sage/categories/finite_posets.html -- there is a passage which looks like this:
!`mathbf{K}`-labelling of !`P`
and another similar passage afterwards. I fixed those in my commit (apparently, you can't use !`...` within *...*).
