The following example, taken from the documentation of the animate module, produces no visible output in the notebook:

```
sage: sines = [plot(c*sin(x), (-2*pi,2*pi), color=Color(c,0,0), ymin=-1,ymax=1) for c in sxrange(0,1,.2)]
sage: a = animate(sines)
sage: a.show()
```

Personally, I completely disagree with this. I think fixing the notebook animate bug, the `<video>` tag and the APNG support should be 3 different tickets.

I guess I could try to split my modifications up. But there are several parts where I would not know where to put them.

* Several documentation improvements are not directly related to either of these issues. Should I file yet another ticket?
* And this whole modification of having `show` call `save` is used for APNG and <video>, so where should it go? Can I create a branch which contains this change, and then use that branch for both APNG and <video>?
* The last commit, about inlining animations in tables, is again distinct, even though it was included in the ticket:7298 patch as well. Separate ticket as well?

The way I see it at the moment, we have 5 distinct modifications, two of which share a commit:

* Notebook:
  * [Create HTML to embed generated GIF in notebook](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=9374cff6d1dbc7ca44749c36a1e5b4693e81819b)
  * [Return path to generated file](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=84886ce6d5d46ee4940f12e7ea508e885ba17ebb)
  * [Avoid leaking animation files](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=8199b0237d6e5053932bd609ea941a02f993b36d)
* Common APNG and <video>:
  * [Base Animation.show on Animation.save, and pass more arguments](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=1d29d17be571d24af57c85aedb2c31e9e5a1277f)
* APNG support:
  * [Add APNG support](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=1f7de6eb7fa8bffdf54e1a73d6c8a0ae4051ffd1)
  * [Avoid multiple acTL hunks in APNG file](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=f3a5b9010cf47bcca463360a2e10e6241c7628be)
  * [Turn generator into list when rendering frames](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=4c9a4910ad273dcb0f6226ef00274267f0192602)
  * [Fix doc test](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=57254600199330cece33a867355183730c611218)
* Documentation improvements:
  * [Improved documentation](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=0c21bd8d4257cb8c96560880a84e827552324378)
* <video> tag support:
  * [Support HTML5 video tag](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=3edfb7f99fc79edf4716eb2e80f927213b9f86cb)
  * [More control over video tag attributes](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=b8a3c7c3affeffea7d3054e69f18065204c5d930)
* Tables:
  * [Inline animations in tables](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=51007fbf59595127ed4b784155e91d78ebb52b2a)

It would take some time to work out whether these branches each make sense on their own. I'd prefer to only invest that effort if I know it is actually needed. Would you be willing to review some of these aspects, Jeroen? If so, that would be one reason for formatting things in the way you prefer.

Ok; I worked on #12827, and I confess I didn't think to check functionality in the notebook.  The following is indeed broken, but I don't know why (I haven't read this ticket yet):

```
c = animate([circle((i,i), 1-1/(i+1), hue=i/10) for i in srange(0,2,0.2)],xmin=0,ymin=0,xmax=2,ymax=2,figsize=[2,2])
c.show()
```

Moreover, when I do

```
c.save()
```

I get nothing, but when I do 

```
c.save('tmp.gif')
```

the gif is saved and is displayed.  I'll investigate further . . .

I agree, namely the two instances where `sage.misc.temporary_file.graphics_filename` got replaced by `tmp_filename`.

> Do we really need all this infrastructure for this to be fixed?  (I'm not saying we don't, just checking.)


Not neccessarily. We could get away with just replacing `tmp_filename` by `graphics_filename` if we are in the `EMBEDDED_MODE` case. This is essentially undoing the `graphics_filename` removal from #12827. Although I would advise against unconditionally using `graphics_filename`. I did that at some point, and suddenly my test suite started bleeding files into the current working directory from where I ran the tests. That's why I wrote [8199b02](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=8199b0237d6e5053932bd609ea941a02f993b36d) in my now-superseded branch.

The reason to have all this infrastructure is twofold. On the one hand, it also facilitates later improvements, like #7298 and #16571. On the other hand, it makes code more similar to `Graphics.show`, which helps maintainability. So I really suggest you compare `Animation.show` to [Graphics.show](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/graphics.py#n1785) when reviewing this. There you see common aspects:

The former saves in a temporary directory which the notebook knows nothing about, whereas the latter saves in the current directory where the notebook will find the file and display it to the user. Also note #16573 about this “I get nothing” user experience.

Great discussion!  But let's keep in mind that probably in this particular case the **most** important thing is that Sage 6.3 allows animations to work again.   Niles' branch doesn't allow me to look at various commits, but I think that just making this work first is most important, even if that means a slight amount of rebasing for the "right fix".  Let's put it this way - I don't think a one-liner change really will mean much difference for gagern's code, because he can just put that in another ticket and even use the same exact branch :-)

Thanks for the clarification. I guess I thought of “review” mostly in terms of “code review” and therefore didn't apply it to situations where there is no code to review.
