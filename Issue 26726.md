Once #26902 is complete, and Sage itself has no internal dependency on the pexpect interface to GAP, it should probably be deprecated entirely.

Completing work on #26902 will likely expose additional, previously unknown deficiencies in the libgap interface, but once those are all resolved there will be little (if any?) advantage to using the pexpect interface.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26963

Note that there may be non-library code relying on the pexpect GAP interface. The current "official" version of p_group_cohomology is an example.

For the next version 3.1, I am moving from pexpect to libgap. Actually I don't recall my original motivation for that change. However, from experience, I can tell (where GAP denotes that software and gap denotes the pexpect interface to GAP):
- Overall, libgap is vastly superior to gap. So, generally I'd recommend switching from gap to libgap.

  - `libgap.eval` is closer to `gap.__call__` than to `gap.eval`; `libgap.__call__` is closer to `gap.eval` than to `gap.__call__`.
  - It is my experience with pexpect that in many cases string evaluation is much more efficient than a "pythonic" usage of the interface; more on that below. When changing to libgap, all these string evaluations need to be completely rewritten.

With libgap, efficiency is no more a reason for using string evaluation. That's yet another reason why I think libgap is superior over gap. However, the work involved when switching to libgap may be a reason for other authors of third-party software to avoid the switch and keep using pexpect.

That's why we have a deprecation process.  It would be interesting to look at that package and see in what way it relies on GAP though.

You'd have to give an example.

That's an arbitrary design "decision" though that seems to have been made without much reason.  It doesn't need to be that way.

Again, hence, a deprecation period.  I don't suspect it would be a massive overhaul for most uses but that's why I ask: I don't know for sure and would need to see examples.

The title of this ticket is "deprecate", not "remove".  A follow-up "remove" ticket would only be made once deprecation is complete, and even then removal would not be for at least a year.

See #26001, if you are interested. Note that the group cohomology package uses gap mainly when creating initial data of a cohomology ring and initial data of an induced homomorphism. So, the main part of the computations doesn't rely on GAP. The actual work is done with my code and with Singular (currently via pexpect).

That's interesting. I just tried to reconstruct it from an example that I met during my cohomology computations. But I find that even the evaluation of a string of length 1974754 is very quick. Have there been some recent improvement, in the past four months?

Now that the decision was made, it shouldn't be changed back, IMHO.

> I'm not sure what you're talking about here and would need to see a concrete example.  It sounds like you're describing a problem with the pexpect interface, in which case it's a moot point if it's going to be deprecated.  But I'm probably not understanding you.


Indeed I was talking about ways of coding that used to be needed to overcome shortcomings of the pexpect interface. libgap doesn't have these shortcomings. However, it isn't a moot point: Translating the old work-around-pexpect-flaws code into make-the-best-out-of-a-C-library code is quite tedious, and more tedious than changing from 1-based to 0-based lists.

The point only becomes moot since apparently you are not going to rip out pexpect from the next release.

As I have mentioned on various occasions, I already have changed p_group_cohomology from pexpect gap to libgap. See #26001, which according to Volker has a merge conflict (he didn't tell what it conflicts with).

p_group_cohomology is a genuine SageMath package and cannot be used independently of SageMath. So, till today I didn't bother to link to the source tarball from my homepages, but I suppose that the package *documentation* can be found by google or duckduckgo.

Anyway, [my home pages](https://users.fmi.uni-jena.de/~king/cohomology/) provide links to the [documentation](http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/cohomology/documentation) and (since today) also to the [source tarball](https://users.fmi.uni-jena.de/cohomology/p_group_cohomology-3.1.tar.xz) of the package (version 3.1, hence, already with libgap).

I do.  For changes that require more than a regexp the use of macros is also possible.  So if you've already done the translation I don't know what the problem is.

Simply I don't know how to make the repository public without paying for it.

In comment:1, I think I made clear enough that I did not ask "how to change p_group_cohomology from gap to libgap". I was merely using p_group_cohomology as an example for non-library SageMath code.

So, "what is the problem"? The problem from my perspective was that in the past most of p_group_cohomology's versions had to cope with backward incompatible changes in the SageMath API (where I define API to include all class definitions in .pxd files, all import locations and names in SageMath, and the infrastructure to build packages) and by changes in Singular.

It has happened that I developed a new version coping with changes in SageMath, and *while the new version was being reviewed* new changes in SageMath forced me to change the package-being-reviewed yet again.

Frankly, about one or two years ago I was so annoyed that I was very close to drop SageMath.

So, the request that I was making in comment:1 boils down to: When doing non-trivial changes in Sage it isn't enough to fix the Sage library code. Keep in mind that there are people building code on top of SageMath (I suppose I am not the only developer who does). Make the transition easy for people and keep SageMath something that people can stably rely on --- or you'll lose them.

We're making this same mistake over again with GAP, but right now there isn't time to do it any other way.

With the new Sage package structure, one can be virtually sure that a user cannot install the package in a Sage version older than the one for which the package was reviewed.

That's right, I switched to libgap. So, p_group_cohomology is no obstacle against a deprecation of gap-via-pexpect.
