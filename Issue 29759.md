Well, at least in `FiniteLatticePoset.congruences_lattice` we expect to be able to create set partitions of arbitrary sets:


```
sage: P = posets.AntichainPoset(2)
sage: L = LatticePoset(P.with_bounds())
sage: L.congruences_lattice()
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for <: 'Integer Ring' and '<class 'str'>'
sage: L.relabel().congruences_lattice()
Finite lattice containing 4 elements
```

(personally, I also create set partitions of arbitrary sets quite frequently)

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
