Those two imports of `binomial` are not actually used, so better just remove them. That is also the reason why the deprecation warning did not trigger: with deprecated lazy imports, the warning is only shown when using the functions.

Interestingly, the `binomial` in `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/asymptotics_multivariate_generating_functions.py` is "used" in the code but no doctest tests it (otherwise we would see the deprecation warning). I created #24053 for that.
