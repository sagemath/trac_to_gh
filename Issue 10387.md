Keywords: prepaser encoding

[PEP 263](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/) says that the encoding line for a Python file should match a certain regular expression in the first or second line, but the preparser seems to be looking for the precise string "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-".

We should follow PEP 263 precisely. In particular, this will make it easy for SageTeX users to specify an encoding; because of TeX weirdness that I don't entirely understand, it is easiest to write the line "## -*- coding: utf-8 -*-" to the generated script.
