The part of the developer guide that describes the docstring of classes and functions should be updated. For example a function with no input or output does not need an `INPUT` or `OUTPUT` block.

Looks good, but there is a typo in 'mentionned'.

What would you think of splitting it into 'INPUT' and 'OUTPUT' entries? Looks weird to have the two simultaneously when all others are listed block per block.

I can do it if you don't want to.

+1 to this from me. But should we wait if others complain at sage-devel? Some might argue for example that in Python the function signature shows if there is no input at all, but output can not be seen directly from it. 

And when we are at this, maybe take few days to think...? Maybe we should add for example a paragraph on assumptions? What about `self` - I have tried to remove them from docstring.

How would that be a problem with respect to what you wrote?

I am getting bored, and remembered that we had no 'default' SAT solver in Sage, so I do the dishonest job of writing a LP SAT solver, that just solves the LP, so that we get a default one.

So doing, I implement a function called 'nvars'. I'd say that what it returns is pretty obvious, and already made clear by the first line of the description. In this situation, function signature or not, I do not think that a 'OUTPUT' block is needed.

Jori, if you want to add a commit about documenting `self`, you are free to do it. And it is good for me to wait a bit if you like it better.

I agree that the `OUTPUT` block can sometimes be omitted. I've seen docstrings that start like this:

```
def jones_polynomial(self):
    """
    Return the Jones polynomial of this link.

    OUTPUT:

    - the Jones polynomial of this link
```

and I think we can safely omit the `OUTPUT` block in such cases.

You're right, if there is some ambiguity about the type, then that should certainly be clarified, and the `OUTPUT` block is a good place to do that.

Now it is wednesday. Should we go with this?

I think that "this object" is OK.

For example `maximal_antichains()` in posets returns just a list, whereas `antichains()` returns more complex data structure. The latter one has explicit output type (but at #18941 I suggest a slight modification to it).

It could be argued that `maximal_antichains()` should also say that the return type is a list (of lists). But should a user looking at example guess from `[[0], [1, 2], [1, 3], [4]]` the type? I think yes, but this can be argued.

INPUT- and OUTPUT-block

```
This block is mandatory only if the input is not clear from the description.
```

This sounds very vague and is in very contrast to what was there before, where it explicitly was mentioned: "This is not optional.". To me this does not feel like you should or are encouraged to include such a block, but more like "include it if you want, but your nice description will handle everything as well...".

From a the side of a user: Often someone just wants to look up what exactly are the input-possibilites (type/parent) or which output (again e.g. type/parent) is returned. Then it is hard, if there is a parameter not in the INPUT/OUTPUT block.

I think having INPUT/OUTPUT blocks for all functions (that have input/output; but *I* wouldn't mind including it everywhere) improved the documentation of [SageMath](SageMath) a lot and I don't want this to stop.

Is this a grammatically correct sentence:

```
The OUTPUT block can also mentionned the errors that the function can possibly raise.
```

+1 for raising an exception.

Oneline is fine and I could imagine to skip the input block and would include the following output block:

```
OUTPUT:

A :mod:`Sage Integer <sage.rings.integer_ring>` or :mod:`oo <sage.rings.infinity>`.
```

(Maybe use other hyperlinktargets; maybe skip `oo` if this cannot happen; maybe only `Integer` (instead of `Sage Integer`.)
In this way the user gets some more information. (Although we developers know that `.cardinality` always returns this type of output; this may not be obvious/clear/known to arbitrary users.)

I sometimes do it like this:

```
Return if this poset has a unique maximal element.

OUTPUT:

A boolean.
```

One could replace `A boolean` by ```True`` or ``False```.

I find this ("a list (or iterable)") good, since it says list (the beginner will know what this is), but also mentions iterable, so this it is clear that iterables are allowed and the advanced user and iterator-loving user will be happy :)

This is a longer test to see if trac just don't accept a string longer than few bytes. Please ignore.

I think that there is no common view for referring to `self` in docstring: i.e. to say "Return foo number of the xyzzy." or "Return foo number of `self`."

Shall we try to document some common cases like functions returning a Boolean ("Test whether..." vs. "Return `True` if...") or `certificate`-option?

Or just close this ticket as wontfix?
