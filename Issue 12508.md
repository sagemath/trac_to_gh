Keywords: spkg CXX C++ compiler hard-coded

In `src/factory/GNUmakefile.in`, we currently have:

```make
# create cf_gmp.h
cf_gmp.h: GNUmakefile gen_cf_gmp.template
        echo "#!/bin/sh" >gen_cf_gmp.sh 
        echo "GMP_H_T=\"`g++ $(LIBCXXFLAGS) -M gen_cf_gmp.cc|grep gmp.h` \"" >>gen_cf_gmp.sh 
        cat gen_cf_gmp.template >>gen_cf_gmp.sh
        $(SHELL) gen_cf_gmp.sh
```


The attached p6 spkg fixes this (by using `$(CXX)`, as everywhere else), and also two typos.

----

This bug shows up (and leads to a build error) e.g. if you use a different C++ compiler (or version of `g++`) by setting `CXX` and specify `CXXFLAGS` the "default" `g++` doesn't understand.

Thanks for the review!

Perhaps Alexander (or Martin) wants to report this upstream, as their trac occasionally doesn't like me... ;-)  (Haven't yet tried to, though.)
