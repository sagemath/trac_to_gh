# Issue 29367: Laurent polynomials rings in characteristic 2 have strange generators

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29604

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2020-04-27 14:10:28

Keywords: Laurent polynomial ring

Behold:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(GF(2), 2)
sage: P.gens()
(-x, -y)
```

Those minus signs cause trouble if you try to pass them onward:

```
sage: Q = LaurentPolynomialRing(GF(2), 2, P.gens())
...
ValueError: variable name '-x' is not alphanumeric
```

I can reproduce this with the base field `GF(4)`, so it may be an issue with characteristic 2 rather than with `GF(2)` specifically.

Here is a possible fix. Instead of using the possibly absent `PolyDict.__zero` to determine the base ring, this uses the first coefficient.

Looks good to me. Let's see if patchbot concurs.
