Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18840

I am trying to reduce the use of `HAS_DICTIONARY` and noticed that the function `make_morphism` in `src/sage/categories/morphism.pyx` is completely unused. All doctests still pass after removing this.

I don't understand the utility of this function as well. Positive review.
