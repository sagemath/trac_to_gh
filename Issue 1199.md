# Issue 1199: cvxopt fix [with spkg]

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jkantor

Original creation time: 2007-11-18 08:03:11

Assignee: was

Minor addition to cvxopt package so that when building with gfortran, sage/local/lib is in the library path. Also stripped out documentation to save some space. 

cvxopt-0.9.p1.spkg

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs

This supercedes the cvxopt versions in 1125 and 1161
