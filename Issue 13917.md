Shuffle product contains method does not work properly.

```
sage: w = Word('ab')
sage: x = Word('ac')
sage: w.shuffle(x)
Shuffle product of word: ab and word: ac
sage: s = w.shuffle(x)
sage: s.list()
[word: abac, word: aabc, word: aacb, word: aabc, word: aacb, word: acab]
sage: x*w in s
False
```

Hellooooooooooooooooooo !!

Well, this patch definitely fixes a bug and is only slower ono the instances for which it gave bad answers... I think that it's good to go ! What would you think of adding a `.. TODO` in the method's docstring saying that the pdf given above contains the recipe for an efficient future new implementation of that method ?

Whether you chose to add this comment or not, feel free to set this ticket to `positive_review` once you are set `:-)`
