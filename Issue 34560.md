in `src/sage/rings/tate_algebra_element.pyx`, why are you doing this change ?

```diff
-        NOTE::
+        NOTE:
```

Because the content, currently not indented, is a long explanation containing a nested list. I decided it was better for the moment to keep it unidented. I do not fix in this ticket the many occurences of "NOTE:".
