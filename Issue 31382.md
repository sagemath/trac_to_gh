As promised in #13674, I refactor some things to support `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` over inexact rings. The main idea is to use the `block_ldlt()` method that supports inexact rings instead of `indefinite_factorization()` which does not.

Controversial bits:

1. The `certificate` argument to `is_positive_definite()` has been removed. This lets us unify the interface and implementation with `is_positive_semidefinite()`. If the user wants the factorization (which is all the certificate was), he can still ask for it directly.

2. I've left the `indefinite_factorization` method alone even though it is largely superseded by `block_ldlt(classical=True)`. Does anyone want to factorize complex matrices that are symmetric but not hermitian? How about symmetric matrices over finite fields where "conjugate" is meaningless? If not, we could deprecate/remove `indefinite_factorization()`. But I know little about what people do with matrices over finite fields.

3. I've declared that every constant, non-relational symbolic expression is a square in `SR`. This is not really principled; it just sounds true, and makes `cholesky()` work with symbolic matrices whose entries are "numbers".

I am not sure about dropping the `certificate` from `is_positive_definite()`. I would lean towards adding one for `is_positive_semidefinite()` to make it consistent. At the very least, it will require a deprecation.

I cannot comment on 2 or 3.

I would change this block:

```
-        for d_i in d:
-            if d_i.nrows() == 1:
-                if semi:
-                    if d_i < 0:
-                        return False
-                else:
-                    if d_i <= 0:
-                        return False
-            else:
-                # There's a 2x2 block
-                return False
-        return True
+        if semi:
+            return not any(d_i.nrows() > 1 or d_i < 0 for d_i in d)
+        else:
+            return not any(d_i.nrows() > 1 or d_i <= 0 for d_i in d)
```

Also, would it be better to do `d_i[0,0]` so the actual entry is checked? Another alternative would be

```
return all(d_i.nrows() == 1 and d_i >= 0 for d_i in d)
```

and similarly for the positive definite case. IMO this is a more clear than the negative test.

The real problem here is that `certificate` is returning an implementation detail, namely the `indefinite_factorization()` that was computed to check the eigenvalues.In order to make `is_positive_definite()` numerically stable, I've already changed that implementation detail -- there's no indefinite factorization to return.

A related problem is that the `certificate` argument to the superclass method can't always be honored in subclasses. There is no `certificate` argument for `RDF` or `CDF` matrices, for example. If `is_positive_definite()` is ever implemented for some other subclass using a C library, that C library is certainly not going to return an `indefinite_factorization()`, so what can we do if the user wants a certificate?

If we have to deprecate it first, then we have to continue using `indefinite_factorization()`, which means we can't make it numerically stable (or work with rings like `SR` and `RR`) until the deprecation period is over.

I went one further and replaced this with


```python
       import operator
       op = operator.gt
       if semi:
           op = operator.ge

to minimize duplication. It's a lot clearer now, thanks.
