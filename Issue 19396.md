Nearly trivial, but from my interpretation of [the 3rd party packaging doc](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#package-versioning), we were suppose to have the first patched version be `.p0`? If we are suppose to be `.p1`, then you can set a positive review. Otherwise, you can set positive review after the appropriate change.

I really don't think it matters if it's `.p0` or `.p1`. But I'll change it because you ask.
