This is a followup to #11967. On OS X with Xcode 4.3, the command `xcodebuild` is no longer maintained, so we shouldn't use it to check the Xcode version number. So in spkg-install, replace its use with just a check on the version of OS X.

On first sight, this looks okay.  It needs testing though...
