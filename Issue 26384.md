`@`dima: could you check that variable `logLnr` is always assigned a value in methods `bliss_graph_from_labelled_edges` and `bliss_digraph_from_labelled_edges`. I seems that it might be used uninitialized...

Dima, see comment:1.

David, Micro-optimization, but since you know `cdef list done = [False] * n` will be a length `n` array of `bint`'s, you are better to directly allocate such an array (Cython generates better C code and you do not have the overhead of `list`).

I will do that. I also did a mistake in initializations. I will fix that.

It seems to be a good idea to declare `logLnr` as

```
cdef int logLnr = 0
```

(in two places in `src/sage/graphs/bliss.pyx`)
