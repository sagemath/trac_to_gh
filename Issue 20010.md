Some documentation will need to be changed after we have implemented checking the Skinner-Urban conditions. (Fairly minor)  Mainly mentioning that Skinner-Urban is being invoked.

I don't understand what this ticket is asking for. I believe that #20249 addresses all that one should do in relation to Skinner-Urban's result. Especially it does not seem to me that the documentation of the p-adic L-function needs any changes.

This ticket was a miscommunication and should never have been created.  That's what happened.
