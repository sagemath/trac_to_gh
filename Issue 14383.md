this shouldn't happen:


```
P.<a,b,c> = !PolynomialRing(ZZ,3)
I = sage.rings.ideal.Katsura(P,3) # regenerate to prevent caching
I.groebner_basis('!macaulay2:gb') # optional - macaulay2
!TypeError: _groebner_basis_macaulay2() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prot'
```

I can confirm that the fix works (with Macaulay2 installed from Fedora). 

There are some failing doctests, for example

```
sage -t sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring.py

Can you clean those up, too?
