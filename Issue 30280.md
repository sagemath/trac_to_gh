This was with gcc 9. But I get the same result with gcc 10.

In the first part of the diff, you are removing two tests. I am assuming that means that they would fail individually without the other one being present. Is it the case?

The fact that you could run all the command individually without problem means the environment has to be "primed". There is probably a memory leak somewhere that leads to that particular outcome. Finding the leak may not be obvious.

I don't know if removing just the first test in the first part of the diff would be sufficient to fix things. I can try just removing the first test. It appeared to me that perhaps `t = dual_GQ_ovoid(*t)` was tainted so I removed the second test also. This may be incorrect.

But I do think you are correct in that there is a possible memory leak.

`is_GQ_with_spread` internally calls `is_generalized_quadrangle`, so the issue lies in the first removed doctest.
In #30223 we had a similar issue with `is_generalized_quadrangle` which was called on an incidence structure not manipulated with `dual_GQ_ovoid`, so I'm keen to assume that `dual_GQ_ovoid` is not the cause of the issue.

I can't reproduce the `MemoryError` on my machine so I created a test-function whose doctests should pretty much cover all operations done in `is_generalised_quadrangle`. Could you please run the doctests and let me know all lines (if any) that fail?

we should improve `is_generalized_quadrangle`.


there is no need to construct the incidence graph. In the regular+uniform  case, i.e. if (s,t) are defined, just check that the collinearity graph (aka block graph) is s.r.g. with the correct parameters.

Otherwise,
if neither s nor t are defined, it is not a GQ, for either t or s must be 1. To finish, if s is not 1, take the dual, so now s=1, and the collinearity graph must be complete bipartite.

I understand that the collinearity graph of a GQ is a srg, but I'm uncertain about the converse.
In particular, there are many difference incidence structures that have the same collinearity graph.
If we allow duplicate blocks, then an incidence structure which is a regular GQ with a duplicated block is no more a GQ, but its collinearity graph is the same. Perhaps this is just an edge-case and not allowing duplicate blocks would fix the converse, but I'm not sure.

> Otherwise,

I don't see why this would be the case, but I trust you.
Also you say that if s is not defined, then t must be 1 and vice versa?

> now s=1, and the collinearity graph must be complete bipartite.
Consider the incidence structure with blocks `[[1, 2], [2, 3]]`.
Then s = 1 and t is not defined.
Its collinearity graph has edges `[(1, 2), (2, 3)]` which is complete bipartite K_{2, 1}, but the incidence structure is not a GQ.
I think that more generally complete bipartite K_{n, 1} are not GQ, is this right?

right, these are so called degenerate generalised polygons (a number of lines all intersecting in one point). Usually, but not excluded from the definition. Let's exclude this case.

We should also exclude the case of repeated lines.


Note that it is immediate (there cannot be any triangls, but for any point p and line L not on L there is a point collinear on L collinear to p) from the definition of a generalised quadrangle that two non-intersecting lines have the same size. 
Dually, for any 2 non-collinear points the number of lines on each of then must be the same.  

It follows that there are either lines of two different sizes, and you have a "grid" (just 2 lines on each point, so t=1), or all lines are of the same size.

I'm very sorry I goofed things up. I thought it was only closed tickets that should not be messed with.

I also thought it would be easy to revert my commit, so I'm also sorry that I don't know how to "put back the exact same branch that was here". My attempt was rejected:

```
STDERR: error: failed to push some refs to 'git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
STDERR: hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
```

I know very little about git, so, since this didn't work, all I would know how to do is push a reversion commit to undo my erroneous change, but I don't think you want me to do that, because it would add yet another commit to the history.  (Maybe a "forced push" would work, but I am not confident enough to try something like that, because my understanding is that it has the potential to mess things up permanently.)
