I expected these subtle differences. I cannot explain the cause of the differences, but know where to look. You can start with 

`vimdiff src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/sage_autodoc3.py local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` 

and perhaps also with comparing `sage_autodoc3` with the original `sage_autodoc`. 

I would welcome commits to fix these unpleasant changes, after switching to a public branch. 

To understand how an attribute (in the general sense, of a module or of a class) is rendered by Sphinx, note that a  suitable `Documenter` is selected for each attribute in the last lines of the following (in `sage_autodoc`): 

```
    def document_members(self, all_members=False):
        """Generate reST for member documentation.

        If *all_members* is True, do all members, else those given by
        *self.options.members*.
        """
        # set current namespace for finding members
        self.env.temp_data['autodoc:module'] = self.modname
        if self.objpath:
            self.env.temp_data['autodoc:class'] = self.objpath[0]

        want_all = all_members or self.options.inherited_members or \
            self.options.members is ALL
        # find out which members are documentable
        members_check_module, members = self.get_object_members(want_all)

        # remove members given by exclude-members
        if self.options.exclude_members:
            members = [(membername, member) for (membername, member) in members
                       if membername not in self.options.exclude_members]

        # document non-skipped members
        memberdocumenters = []
        for (mname, member, isattr) in self.filter_members(members, want_all): <------------------------
            classes = [cls for cls in itervalues(self.documenters)
                       if cls.can_document_member(member, mname, isattr, self)]  <----------------------
            if not classes:
                # don't know how to document this member
                continue
            # prefer the documenter with the highest priority
            classes.sort(key=lambda cls: cls.priority)                 <----------------------
            # give explicitly separated module name, so that members
            # of inner classes can be documented
            full_mname = self.modname + '::' + \
                '.'.join(self.objpath + [mname])
            documenter = classes[-1](self.directive, full_mname, self.indent)               <---------- look here

            memberdocumenters.append((documenter, isattr))

        ...
```

I just meant the one currently shipped with Sage. So not the latest.

Fair enough regarding `padic_lseries`.

Still, there is more documentation which is removed. For example `sage.combinat.finite_state_machine.FiniteStateMachine.output_alphabet`

In the sources, there is

```python
    output_alphabet = None
    """
    A list of letters representing the output alphabet of the finite
    state machine.

    It can be set by the parameter ``output_alphabet`` when initializing
    a finite state machine, see :class:`FiniteStateMachine`.

    It can also be set by the method :meth:`determine_alphabets`.

    .. SEEALSO::

        :class:`FiniteStateMachine`,
        :meth:`determine_alphabets`,
        :attr:`input_alphabet`.
