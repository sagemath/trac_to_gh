# Issue 21185: Failure with log(ZZ) to negative base

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: ((-1)^(-I*log(3)/pi)).n()
3.00000000000000
sage: log(3,-1)
...
ValueError: m must be positive
```

The `ValueError` is raised in `ZZ(3).log(-1)` but the calling symbolic log only catches `(AttributeError, TypeError)` for further evaluation.
