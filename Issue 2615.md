Assignee: was

Sage has now an implementation of the Jordan canonical form (see #874)

However for most applications (like computing the exponential of a matrix,
see #2273) we would need to be able to compute not only the Jordan form, but
the Jordan basis as well (or what is equivalent the coordinate-change matrix P
such that P^(-1) A P = J, where A is the matrix, and J is its Jordan normal form)

(As far as I know, Maple can do that)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/2615
