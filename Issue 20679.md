Apparently on Debian / Ubuntu a libgiac dependency may not be installed with the giac install and is somehow needed when installing Pynac in Sage (which optionally has giac installed).

To prevent unwanted linking and to reduce confusion `--with-giac=no` should be set in the Pynac spkg.

Hi Ralf,

Could you put a link to upstream report?

I have no idea what to report since it doesn't happen on my system. FWIW, it could even be that it's because William has giac installed in system instead of via `sage -i`.

Unfortunately this will only work as is on systems without giac. With giac, the optional test is done which (if not linked with pynac as was removed with the first commit) will trigger a Pynac bug.

So the optional doctest must be removed as well. Still positive?

Yep, (vanilla) giac's configure instructions do not mention libao either.  But if building pynac *may* fail on !Debian/Ubuntu (hardly anyone uses these distros, I know), pynac's configure should catch that case (either by disabling giac, or giving an appropriate error message).

I'd say solve it upstream if you find the time, and we can eventually revert the changes here with one of the next releases of pynac.

Or we could make Sage's giac package a standard one.
