The `random_prime` function in Sage can take one, two or three arguments. But the only examples of using this function use only one argument. 

```
        sage: random_prime(100000)
        88237
        sage: random_prime(2)
        2
```

Although some with good Python knowledge may argue the behaviour with 2 or 3 arguments is documented properly, I personally think it could be clearer. 

For example, I'm told:

```
random_prime(123,False)
```

would normally be written as 

```
random_prime(123, proof=False)
```

It would be good with someone with decent Python knowledge to write some examples of using this function with 2 or 3 arguments.

Since there appears to be some disagreement about the code changes on #10112, if those can't  be resolved soon, I suggest we just change the documentation on this ticket. The 3 changes needed are:

* The error message "*n must be greater than lbound *" is incorrect, and should be changed to "*n must be at least lbound*"
* The example `random_prime(200, lbound=100)` is added 
* The example `random_prime(200, proof=False, lbound=100)` is added.
