Should I undo the changes to the dev files ? it seems that dev is going to be removed.

In what ticket?

Now #20645 has already been closed, so it seems clear that you should "rebase" this ticket, i.e. remove dev files.

done. There may still be a conflict in the next beta, we will see.

OK, I'll review.

These are not equivalent due to a space:


```
print "L(" + str(1+2*i) + ", (-4/.)): ", RR . . .
print("L({}, (-4/.)): {}".format(1+2*i, RR . . .
```


Otherwise I see no problems and I am now compiling and testing. However, a question: what is the meaning of the comma at `print('key %s' % (k,))`?

Tests passed and documentation built. Please read my message "Testing and consecutive spaces in output" on sage-devel before changing this to _positive_review_ on behalf of me. Otherwise I found nothing to complain about.
