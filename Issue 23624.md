# Issue 23624: Make Expression normalization work with symbolic powers

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23861

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-09-14 14:51:23

Expression normalization only works with standard polynomials:

```
sage: (x^2 + x^(-2) - 2).normalize()
(x^4 - 2*x^2 + 1)/x^2

vs

sage: (x^(2*pi) + x^(-2*pi) - 2).normalize()
x^(2*pi) + x^(-2*pi) - 2
```


This is necessary for being able to factor all symbolic expressions.
