in `src/sage/sets/set.py`, you wrote `hash(s)` instead of `hash(t)`

```diff
-            sage: t = tuple(s)
-            sage: hash(s) != hash(tuple(X.set()))
+            sage: t = tuple(s)
+            sage: hash(t) != hash(tuple(X.set()))
```

no, no, we really want to check that s can be hashed.

I have removed the superfluous line `t=tuple(s)`
