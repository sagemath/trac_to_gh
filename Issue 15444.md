Travis noticed in #15669 that immutable graphs were nameless. That's terrible.


```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph()                      
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
Graph on 10 vertices
```


This patch fixes it. So doing, we now store the `name` attribute in the Python graph itself and not in the backend, where it does not really belong. This thing is for storing the graph data, not fancy attributes !

New behaviour :


```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph()
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
sage: Graph(graphs.PetersenGraph(),immutable=True)
Petersen graph: Graph on 10 vertices
```


This patch is based upon #15623, because God made it that we will have to pay the Poset's `._immutable` hack until #15623 is merged `:-P`

Hey Nathann,

Thanks,

Although I think a `TypeError` is a better error message because IMO `NotImplementedError` are for things which have not been implemented yet. Yet this is only my opinion and I won't hold this ticket up because of that.

Hellooooooooooo !!!

I rebased it on beta5 and added a doctest. I used a `NotImplementedError` here, because Simon made me use NotImplementedError for the `add_edge` function of the immutable graph backend when I wanted to use `ValueError`. I personally think that it does not matter the slightest. And I take as proof that nobody agrees on what it should be, which means that no standard is good here `:-P`
