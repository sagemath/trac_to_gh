# Issue 34237: Make FiniteRankFreeModule.tensor_module(0, 1) return the dual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34474

Keywords: tensor_module

In Sage 9.7.rc0, we have

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 2, name='M')
sage: M.tensor_module(0, 1) is M.dual()
False
```

The identity of the two objects, which is mathematically exact, is implemented here. This also simplifies some coercion maps.
