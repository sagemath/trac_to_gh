Implemented a function to test the recursive construction given in the method `balanced_incomplete_block_design`.

This function takes in a maximum value for `v` and a range for `lambda` and then tests all possible BIBDs that can arise from the recursive construction.
I'm not sure if this is what you meant, or if you were thinking at a more general function.

I meant testing every construction available, as if you build a full database of (v,k,l) for which Sage does/does not know how to build a design.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. This was a forced push. New commits:

I rebased the branch to Sage 9.2.beta4.
I know the docstring is wrong and the function now doesn't work (see #30102), but I would like to know if this is a good structure for the function.

The idea is to test whether Sage can build the BIBDs Sage claims to be able to build, then to test that there are not parameters that Sage is able to build but claims it can't.

It should be a quite comprehensive test, but it feels like the second part is going to be hard to maintain.
I'm not sure that's the best approach. I'm not sure how much I should trust sage and the existing code and how much needs to be checked in the test function.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
