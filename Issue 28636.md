Keywords: polyhedron, normaliz, ambient volume

We implement the ambient volume using backend normaliz.

This is done by return 0 or infinity if the polyhedron is not full-dimensional and not compact respectively.

Otherwise, we take the `induced_lattice` volume and divide by `factorial(self.dim())`.

See section 6.1.1 of the normaliz manual on how `induced_lattice` volume relates to euclidean volume: [https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf](https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf)

This is much faster than the current method, so we set this to default if backend is normaliz.


```
sage: P = polytopes.dodecahedron(backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 3.91 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 3.91 ms
Wall time: 1.49 ms
-176*sqrt5 + 400
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 26.5 ms, sys: 332 µs, total: 26.9 ms
Wall time: 27.5 ms
-176*sqrt5 + 400
```



```
sage: P = polytopes.one_hundred_twenty_cell(backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 1.5 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.5 s
Wall time: 210 ms
120*sqrt5
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 8.61 s, sys: 14.7 ms, total: 8.63 s
Wall time: 8.63 s
120*sqrt5
```


```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(6, backend='normaliz')
sage: %time P.volume(engine='normaliz')
CPU times: user 2.33 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 2.33 ms
Wall time: 2.34 ms
64
sage: %time P.volume(engine='internal')
CPU times: user 183 ms, sys: 32 µs, total: 183 ms
Wall time: 182 ms
64
```


Follow up:

Once `affine_hull` completely respects the backend, this method will be used to calculate the induced volume by default (automatically).

```

Is the following "unimodual" a typo? Is unimodular meant?

```diff
+        One other possibility is to compute the scaled volume where a unimodual
```


There is also


```diff
+        volume of the unimodal simplex (or zero if not full-dimensional)::
```


Unimodular?

Could you check if this occurs in the rest of the file too?

Otherwise, the ticket looks good and the bots are green on 9.1rc0, so you can put this on positive review on my behalf once you considered the above comments.
