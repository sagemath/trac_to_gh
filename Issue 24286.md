# Issue 24286: Change string representation of RealField

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24523

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2018-01-11 18:23:15

As a subtask of #24457 we change the string representation of `RealField(XXX)` from

```
Real Field with XX bits of precision
```

to

```
Real Floating-point Field with XX bits of precision
```

I first changed `find .` to `find src` because I was in the `sage` top directory. Then I added `g` after `/` to replace multiple occurences of the pattern in one line. When applying the script there were several things that needed manual adaptation: in `tests/french_book/nonlinear_doctest.py` the print command of a doctest had to be changed to ensure aesthetic results. Also the script picks up `conf.py` files under `src/doc` and for some reasons git thinks it has to delete them and create them new, so I git checked out the originals of all `src/doc/en/reference/*/conf.py` files. The remaining doctest fails appear to be instances of split lines and, according to recent comments by Jeroen which I agree with, that if the output is one line the doctest output should be too, I joined those lines and replaced the pattern.

Also there was one doctest change in a pxd file. 127 files were changed.

Sorry to spoil the party, but what is wrong with "Real Field with XX bits of precision"? Doesn't the "XX bits of precision" imply already that it's floating point? I think that the shorter name `Real Field` is sufficient.

Note that also balls and intervals are floating-point, so do you plan to use `Real Floating-point Interval Field` and `Real Floating-point Ball Field` too?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2018-01-12 12:46:25

And anyway, this kind of things has to be agreed on on sage-devel.

The rationale is: not precise enough. The "Real Field with XX bits of precision" could equivalently be used for intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic".

```
s = "Real Floating-point Field with %s bits of precision"%self.__prec
```


Maybe we should use format instead of printf syntax(percent) as it seems to be the standard way to do it in python 3 ([stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting)).

Can you give a reference? Maybe also in the description? Then the reasoning could more comprehensible. I don't know the details here neither.

I used the former approach and applied it to the recent version of Sage. Furthermore, I replaced the printf syntax.

pyflakes errors seem unrelated. Apart from that, patchbot is green.

It is definitely a positive review on my side. However, I would like to wait a bit because of [the message I posted this morning on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ba9u_As3T4s).


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2020-10-14 11:43:05

What is best "Floating-point" or "Floating-Point"?


---

Comment by @mjungmath created at 2020-10-14 14:09:31

I googled it. I think, common sense in titles is a capitalization of the subsequent hyphen elements if they are e.g. nouns, which is the case here.

https://www.accu-assist.com/grammar-tips-archive/GrammarTip_capitalization-titles-headings-hyphenated-words.htm

Besides, full capitalization looks better imho. :)


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2020-10-14 14:12:21

This is great since I would like to use the shortcut `RFPF` (in place of `RR`) which fits better the capitalization.


---
