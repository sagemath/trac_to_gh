Sorry to spoil the party, but what is wrong with "Real Field with XX bits of precision"? Doesn't the "XX bits of precision" imply already that it's floating point? I think that the shorter name `Real Field` is sufficient.

Note that also balls and intervals are floating-point, so do you plan to use `Real Floating-point Interval Field` and `Real Floating-point Ball Field` too?

The rationale is: not precise enough. The "Real Field with XX bits of precision" could equivalently be used for intervals and balls. The standard terms in the literature are "floating-point arithmetic", "ball arithmetic" and "interval arithmetic".
