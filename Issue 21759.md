Keywords: factorization, finite field

At the moment there is no factorization implemented in iterated extensions of finite fields:

```
sage: K = GF(2)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: L.<x> = K.extension(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: R.<y> = L[]
sage: M.<y> = L.extension(y^2 + y + x)
sage: R.<T> = M[]
sage: (T^2 + T + x).factor()
```

The reason is that `M` in the above example is just a quotient of a polynomial ring over `L`.
Here, we implement isomorphisms (for this special case) to a simple extensions of a prime field over which factorization is implemented. We also implement univariate factorization for polynomial quotient rings if an isomorphism to a field which supports such factorization is known.

I added some `__make_element_class__` around the `SetMorphism`. They make no difference because `SetMorphism` is an extension type, but morally they should be there (if it were not an extension type) so that the result inherits the right methods from the category.

I'll have a closer look soon but right now this looks like a good addition.
The only thing that I find disturbing is the method name `_isomorphic_ring`.
Maybe it's not descriptive enough?

Should the following example work with this branch?  It does not for me.  I get a not implemented error.

All examples in ticket have fields with cardinality a power of 2.
