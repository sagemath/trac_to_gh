* The Foata-SchÃ¼tzenberger transform on permutations is implemented (foata_bijection), but its inverse is not. This should be easy to fix -- an algorithm is given in the very same reference http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1978-3MajorIndexMathNachr.pdf .

* The first fundamental bijection on S_n, as well as its inverse, seem to not be in [SageMath](SageMath) (although FindStat has them: http://www.findstat.org/MapsDatabase/Mp00087 ). A similarly defined map -- forget_cycles -- already exists, but this is not it.

It looks good overall. However, I do have some comments:

- In `to_cycles()`, `mins` does not make grammatical sense to me (I know you are avoiding `min`). How about `use_min`?
- I know you didn't write this, but I don't understand why we need to do `L = list(self)` and iterate over `L`. Why can't we just iterate over `self`? (Of course, you cannot do this for the inverse method.)
- Since `len(M) = k` in your updated code, you can do the faster `[i for i,val in enumerate(M) if val > e]`. Same for `L` in the inverse method.
- Wrong type of tick at the end ``\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}'`.
- I would change
  {{{#!diff
-        The fundamental transformation is a bijection; for its
-        inverse, see :meth:`fundamental_transformation_inverse`.
+        .. SEEALSO::
+
+            :meth:`fundamental_transformation_inverse` for the inverse map.
  }}}
  and similar for the inverse map.
- You say in the ticket description that the `fundamental_transform` is different than `forget_cycles`. You should document this clearly in both of these methods, including an example where they differ.
- The line with the `== P` bugs me:
  {{{#!sage
            sage: all( P.fundamental_transformation_inverse().fundamental_transformation()
            ....:      == P
            ....:      for P in Permutations(4))
  }}}
  I would break the 80 char/line here, but that is bikeshedding. Feel free to ignore.
- I think the border cases and systematic check should be in a `TESTS::` block. Also, I would add a inverse then normal check as well.
