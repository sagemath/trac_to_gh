# Issue 30242: deprecate random_DAG from global namespace

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30479

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2020-08-31 15:47:34

as part of #25383

On the way, we add a generator of  `RandomDirectedAcyclicGraph` to `digraphs` and change method `random_DAG` from `sage.sandpiles.sandpile` by a call to `digraphs.RandomDirectedAcyclicGraph`.

I would just deprecate `random_DAG`. There is no sense in keeping it around when `digraphs` constructor is there. I might also suggest getting rid of the `return_dict` option too, but that is not a strong opinion.
