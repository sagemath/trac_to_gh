Reported by eviatarbach in #9698 (relating to the files `sage/graphs/generic_graph.py` and `sage/graphs/generic_graph_pyx.pyx`):

1. All instances of "hamiltonian" should be changed to "Hamiltonian". This is because Hamilton is a proper noun, and the capitalization transfers to the term (see here:  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianCycle.html). "hypohamiltonian" should be left lower-case, though.

2. ~~"neccesary" should be "necessary"~~

3. "non Hamiltonian" should be "non-Hamiltonian" (note the dash)

4. "Dodecahedral" should not be capitalized; "dodecahedral"

5. "Running the algorithm on random instances, just to make sure the answers are still satisfiable path". Should be "paths".

6. ~~"ajacent" should be "adjacent"~~

7. "Now, we try the algorithm on a non hamiltonian graph, the Petersen graph" should be "graph: the".

8. "another known hypohamiltonian graph, the generalized Petersen" should be "graph: the"
