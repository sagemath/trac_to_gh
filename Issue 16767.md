The height of a poset is the cardinality of the longest chain and can be computed by the rank of a poset (the *length* of the longest chain) plus 1.

This was trivial, thanks to (again) ncohen: height of poset P is just P.rank()+1.

I believe this is useful to have because I wouldn't think of using `rank` for a non-ranked poset (although it might be somewhat naive of me) and height is common terminology.

In your code for optimization purposes, you would be better served by plugging in `P.rank() + 1`, but from a user-interface/teaching perpective, it would be good to have a height method.

Two typos, you're missing a "the" in front of `height` and `lenght`. Although I'd format the one-liner as you did in the header:

```
Return the height (the length of longest chain) of the poset.
```
but I don't really care that much. Once the typos are fixed or the formatting change is made, you can set this to positive review.
