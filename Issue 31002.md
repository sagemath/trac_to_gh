CC:  mkauers mmezzarobba vdelecroix

This package was removed because there was no upstream release (see #26332), but the development is still ongoing https://github.com/mkauers/ore_algebra and the developers follow the Sage development.

We should be able to use a "pip" package source type, with a `requirements.txt` pointing to a commit (or a tag) of the version that works  with the given Sage release.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31239
