Creating mutlivariate Laurent polynomials from other mutlivariate Laurent polynomials sometimes fails.


```

        sage: LQ = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5')
        sage: LZ = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5')
        sage: LQ.inject_variables()
        Defining x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5
        sage: x2^-1*y0*y1*y2*y3*y4*y5 + x1^-1*x2^-1*y0*y1*y3*y4 + x0^-1 in LZ
        True
        sage: x2^-1*y0*y1*y2*y3*y4*y5 + x1^-1*x2^-1*y0*y1*y3*y4 + x0^-1*x1^-1*y0*y3 + x0^-1 in LZ
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'esub'

```


Apparently this is due to the fact that `LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__init__` changes the keys of the input dictionary.

The correct solution is to *not* modify the input data (instead of working around the fact that the input data is modified).

It would be good to add an explicit doctest showing that the input is not modified. Something like

```
sage: LQ.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: D = {(-1, 1): 1}
sage: type(D.keys()[0])
<type 'tuple'>
sage: LQ(D)
x^-1*y
sage: type(D.keys()[0])
<type 'tuple'>

I completely agree. I'll adapt the patch during the day (once my 7.6.beta4 has recompiled again...).
