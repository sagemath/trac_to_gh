Calling twice in a row the function `unpickle_all` breaks sage:


```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
x...
Successfully unpickled 586 objects.
Failed to unpickle 0 objects.
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-4.6.1/local/bin/sage-sage: line 300:  
7292 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
$
```


Doing some `print i, A` inside the loop of the function `unpickle_all` shows that the process stop on the 170th :


```
sage: sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all()
...
163 _class__sage_combinat_sf_homogeneous_SymmetricFunctionAlgebra_homogeneous__.sobj
164 _class__sage_combinat_sf_jack_JackPolynomials_j__.sobj

166 _class__sage_combinat_sf_jack_JackPolynomials_q__.sobj

6926 Abort trap              sage-ipython "$@" -i
 $ 
```


If a solution needs to change the `pickle_jar`, be aware, because it may
results in conflicts because I am actually changing it at #10354.
