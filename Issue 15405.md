A matter of what your script outputs...




So, what about `SAGE_SERVER` to specify a mirror?  While `$SOMEBODY` partially broke that anyway by hardcoding the incompatible `packages/` subfolder, we should IMHO still (or again) support that.  (At least `sage-list-packages` also needs to get fixed, preferably on a separate ticket I'd say.)

Harald, also note Jeroen's comment I quoted [comment:72 above].

Meanwhile, it's not just standard packages, but also optional packages, of which (only) some now have the "new style", i.e., the data of newer ones is hardcoded into the Sage releases, while obsolete "old-style" packages remain in `spkg/optional/list` (and `spkg/optional/`).

```


There are other still optional packages where `sage -i ...` would install newer versions than listed by `sage --optional` because the "local metadata" (`$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package>/package-version.txt`) differs from what `spkg/optional/list` gives.  (Same issue as with our current standard packages.)

A more funny one is TOPCOM:

`./sage -i TOPCOM` installs the "legacy" spkg, while `./sage -i topcom` installs the "new-style" spkg.  (The package versions are currently still the same though, modulo a `.p0` for the "new-style" one.)

**Note for other reviewers:**  So far I'm ok with the changes/corrections made, but haven't yet tested thoroughly enough (I think).

While I don't like completely changing the previously *generic* character of `sage-download-file` (nor removing the "shell fallback" with e.g. `wget` or `curl` if Python isn't available or functional), I strongly doubt we could convince the author or the RM to change that back to how it was.

FTP support (probably with Python3) and e.g. usage of a static mirror list (perhaps to be shipped with Sage) is something for follow-up tickets; the broken behaviour of `sage-list-packages` is (or will be) dealt with at #16759, which depends on *this* ticket.




W.r.t. the threat of losing sagemath.org for downloads:  [According to William](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/79645), *"soon" is not **that** soon*.

Uhm, to reduce that confusion a little bit: The source of this inconsistency is that right now most of the old infrastructure is still running, including the currently "old" website. I would suggest to wait until the "new" website is operational. Then, any bugs in scripts relying on the website will be obvious (and fixes to the new website visible immediately).

The reason why this is a bit slow is, because there are many links assuming certain subdirectories (for documentation and e.g. /mirror/) and my time is limited. I could report back once the DNS entry has switched to the new page.

PS: "new" just means, that there are minor changes like an additional mirror, publications etc. The current "old" website is an older fork of the website with some other patches. Hence this diverged and there is no need to support the old one any more.
