I would replace the regex in `_parse_name` with something like

```
(?P<base>(?:[^-]|-(?!\d))*)-(?P<version>.*)\.(?P<ext>tar.*|zip|tgz)
```

(We may as well support more general package names, even if our restrictive naming convention doesn't allow it at the moment.)

I added a few extra commits to resolve a couple of small bugs I noticed. Pending someone signing off on those, and testing on various versions of python, this looks good to me.

Why remove the possibility to use the system `curl` or `wget` programs? That seems like an unneeded regression to me.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-04 22:36:49

We only need **one** way to download files. There is no point in having untested (hence broken) code laying around "just in case". There is no use case, just clutter laying around.

The use case is building from git on systems without Python installed.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-05 15:55:31

Per the discussion on sage-devel, Python is a requirement. Sooner or later Sage won't build without Python with or without this ticket.

That would require at least a change to the documentation.

Sure, but why break building on systems without Python on this ticket? It is absolutely trivial to keep supporting without Python for now (just keep the shell part of the script). It seems you're breaking stuff for no reason.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-02-06 10:34:39

So would it make you feel better if we wait with this ticket and merge it only after another change broke building without Python?

Essentially yes. I agree with breaking building without Python, but not breaking just for the sake of it.


---

Comment by novoselt created at 2014-11-05 23:38:54

I would say this is not breaking building without Python for the sake of breaking, but for the sake of moving the build system to a language that all Sage developers understand (and therefore can make further improvements).


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2014-11-06 07:21:54

Currently in Sage, we have a Python script to download stuff with a shell-script wrapper to handle the case where Python in Sage is not yet installed. I would rather keep the shell-script wrapper and only modify the Python script.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-11-06 09:45:59

Why have a shell script here-document a fortran program which runs a python script? Just so that we can build Sage without Python for a few more months? The decision is made, Python is a built-time requirement.

I don't recall that discussion...

Let me repeat what I said above:

Why break building on systems without Python on this ticket? It is absolutely trivial to keep support for building without Python for now (just keep the shell part of the script). It seems you're breaking stuff for no reason. I don't mind breaking building without Python if there is a good reason, but not breaking just for the sake of it.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-11-06 11:15:37

You are going to say the same thing all the time, why rely on a Python script here when you could just as well have an additional shell script to provide a fall back. The answer is: fewer moving parts = less bugs.


---

Comment by tmonteil created at 2014-11-06 15:02:06

This is not about python as a requirement nor the curl and wget fallbacks, but i see the benefit of being able to set a `URL_GRABBER` variable that calls some fetcher with more robust options, as discussed on [this sage-devel thread](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/75369).

We must use the mirrors very soon, the centrally-hosted packages will go away.

The downloading script still needs to be called from sage-spkg, when that is finished we must merge this ticket asap.

Not entirely clear to me why you use `.startswith()` though... ;-)

(Ok, it does support `--print-fastest-mirror-and-drop-me-a-beer`, but I'm still waiting...)


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-09 12:37:43

Could we please suppress the tracebacks on errors like 404?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2015-05-09 12:43:55

As you said, using startswith() is a cheap emulation of argparse so `--quiet=...` works. The point is to be compatible with Python 2.6, of course, so we can't use argparse.

That's not something I expect you to merge; it just shows errors in the current code.  As said, we should IMHO use a variable for that.  (I'm not doing your work either... ;-) )

It's still in an error message in `sage-spkg`, although `MIRROR` was used.

Ok, but there's an extra slash (`MIRROR` already has a trailing one).


---

the official mirror list may or may not have a slash at the end

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-09 13:41:00

FTP doesn't seem to work (hangs after receiving the file).

Try for example

```sh
./sage --sh -c 'sage-download-file ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/misc/sage/spkg/optional/list'
```

A matter of what your script outputs...




So, what about `SAGE_SERVER` to specify a mirror?  While `$SOMEBODY` partially broke that anyway by hardcoding the incompatible `packages/` subfolder, we should IMHO still (or again) support that.  (At least `sage-list-packages` also needs to get fixed, preferably on a separate ticket I'd say.)

---

Also, IMHO we should just phase out old-style spkgs. As long as we have to drag along that technical debt its very hard to clean up scripts.

?  Before the breakage, setting `SAGE_SERVER` to e.g. `http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/sagemath/` worked, for example with `sage --optional` and -- long time ago -- with `sage --upgrade`.


Deprecate it, later use `SAGE_MIRROR` for package download purposes?

Replying to [comment:57 vbraun]:

I'm all against that.  The worst decision was to hardcode package metadata (solely!) into specific Sage releases, while that data doesn't even show whether a package is optional, experimental, or whatever.  (It's pretty easy to _create_ "old-style" packages from that though... ;-) )

In my opinion the main reason we should (still) support real spkgs is that anybody can easily create and offer such self-contained packages to others, and installing and using them doesn't artificially depend on the Sage version.  (Whether they'll work of course depends on a couple of things.)

They're also often much more convenient for testing.
 



> As long as we have to drag along that technical debt its very hard to clean up scripts.

Perhaps with the exception of left-over old-style standard packages, I don't see a problem.

Even if they work in principle you can't do that much with them as there is no dependency management. Its just an all-out shitty solution for everyone.

Otherwise `s|SAGE_SERVER/packages/|SAGE_SERVER/spkg/|` in the docs.

AFAIK there will only ever be /spkg/ on the mirrors

Should we fix this here, since we now touch `sage-list-packages` anyway?

```

The whole listing of packages is also made hideously complicated by mashing old and new style packages together...


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-09 15:29:14

I thought of just adding a further `try: ... except HTTPError: ...`, in case `sagemath.org/packages/` remains for a while.  (IIRC it had _both_ for a while.)

`PKG_SERVER` is superfluous anyway; I'd simply use `os.environ['SAGE_SERVER']` there.

As I said, in principle only the old standard packages disturb a bit; otherwise it's just a matter of syncing.

I was actually working on that a few days ago (#16759).

The right solution is updating the website script to take into account the new git-style packages (which is certainly a different issue than the one this ticket is about).

Since I'm CCed: There is currently a move of the whole infrastructure going on. Before that I tried to keep everything compatible with the original system from a long time ago. That's no longer possible. Long story short: the website and the binary-files need to be untangled and that means there are no longer chains of symlink-aliases. Hence, don't use the `/mirror` subdirectory of the website and I hope the essence of this ticket is to get rid of this old dependence. The only mirror related aspect is the `mirror_list` file for the base URLs.

Well, the Sage scripts never used the `mirror/` folder.  The problematic part here is the structure below the base URL; `spkg/` was changed to `packages` on sagemath.org, but the mirrors all have the classical structure (plus `upstream/` below `spkg/`).

The new thing on this ticket is also that we now use [http://www.sagemath.org/mirror_list](http://www.sagemath.org/mirror_list) (currently hardcoded) again, which is periodically generated by a script on the server (or at least used to be).


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-09 17:14:59

Harald, also note Jeroen's comment I quoted [comment:72 above].

Meanwhile, it's not just standard packages, but also optional packages, of which (only) some now have the "new style", i.e., the data of newer ones is hardcoded into the Sage releases, while obsolete "old-style" packages remain in `spkg/optional/list` (and `spkg/optional/`).

`./sage --optional` shows some examples of optional packages which became standard:

```
Optional packages:

...
git-1.7.12.2.p0 ........................ installed version: 2.3.0
...
pyzmq-2.1.11.p1 ........................ installed version: 14.3.0
...
zeromq-3.2.0.p0 ........................ installed version: 4.0.5
```


There are other still optional packages where `sage -i ...` would install newer versions than listed by `sage --optional` because the "local metadata" (`$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/<package>/package-version.txt`) differs from what `spkg/optional/list` gives.  (Same issue as with our current standard packages.)

A more funny one is TOPCOM:

`./sage -i TOPCOM` installs the "legacy" spkg, while `./sage -i topcom` installs the "new-style" spkg.  (The package versions are currently still the same though, modulo a `.p0` for the "new-style" one.)

We definitely should not check sagemath.org/packages any more, I've already changed the release management scripts to no longer put the tarballs there.

Ok, `sagemath.org/spkg/`* gave a 404 for a while, but apparently works again.


---

Comment by leif created at 2015-05-10 15:03:04

*Note for other reviewers:*  So far I'm ok with the changes/corrections made, but haven't yet tested thoroughly enough (I think).

While I don't like completely changing the previously _generic_ character of `sage-download-file` (nor removing the "shell fallback" with e.g. `wget` or `curl` if Python isn't available or functional), I strongly doubt we could convince the author or the RM to change that back to how it was.

FTP support (probably with Python3) and e.g. usage of a static mirror list (perhaps to be shipped with Sage) is something for follow-up tickets; the broken behaviour of `sage-list-packages` is (or will be) dealt with at #16759, which depends on _this_ ticket.




W.r.t. the threat of losing sagemath.org for downloads:  [According to William](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.devel/79645), _"soon" is not *that* soon_.

I don't mind if you rewrite the functionality in bash fwiw. I would consider it utterly retarded and backward, but as long as it works and you are committed to maintaining that solution then that would be fine with me.

Replying to [comment:77 leif]:

Uhm, to reduce that confusion a little bit: The source of this inconsistency is that right now most of the old infrastructure is still running, including the currently "old" website. I would suggest to wait until the "new" website is operational. Then, any bugs in scripts relying on the website will be obvious (and fixes to the new website visible immediately).

The reason why this is a bit slow is, because there are many links assuming certain subdirectories (for documentation and e.g. /mirror/) and my time is limited. I could report back once the DNS entry has switched to the new page.

PS: "new" just means, that there are minor changes like an additional mirror, publications etc. The current "old" website is an older fork of the website with some other patches. Hence this diverged and there is no need to support the old one any more.

Could we already test the new one (using its unofficial address) w.r.t. download stuff / package (and mirror) lists?

The attached branch will only use www.sagemath.org to download the mirror list, so once we have merged it there are a lot fewer things that could break.

Friday. It's tedious stupid work, so maybe I'm already whining more about it than it will actually take to work on.

No, Github resolves the inofficial URL to the official one and I don't want to mess with this around even more.

Yes, it's just one file, and as already mentioned: the full list could easily be hardcoded as a backup into Sage to remove that SPOF. Ticket for later please :-)

Provided the mirrors can still sync...




In principle we could already include a snapshot of `mirror_list` into the git tree (in `$SAGE_ROOT/`?  in more human-readable form?).  The dynamic one should rather be located in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/var/{lib,tmp}/sage/`, say, not `$SAGE_DIST_FILES/` (defaults to `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`).

Nothing else needs the mirror list so why put it in a separate file? In any case, this question should be dealt with in a separate ticket.

Human users perhaps?

You're right, all package metadata should be moved into `sage-spkg` as well.

There are many packages but only one mirror list. Your argument is invalid.

Not to mention the question of what file format, custom = crap, json = not exactly human-readable, yaml = not necessarily available in the System python, is it supposed to be readable from a shell script, ...

Plain text, one URL per line, preferably in the top-level folder.  What's the problem?

Any human and any kind of script can easily read such.  (If you want to add further data such as organization, location etc., just put that after each URL, seperated by whitespace, but I wouldn't even do that.  We don't have to process that.  Blank lines and comment lines starting with `#` at the first position would IMHO be ok, too, but that's not really needed.  Order of the mirrors doesn't matter for our purposes either, although we could keep them sorted by continent, say.) 

I thought we had postponed that to a follow-up ticket.

We have, but you keep bringing it up.

Not me, [comment:84 Harald] did.

Yay! 2 days ahead of schedule! I fixed all the obviously broken links and there are just two minor details left.

sagemath.org no longer serves packages (especially not the upstream tarballs); is that intentional, or will it again?  (Cf. [sage-release](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.sage.release/2834).)
