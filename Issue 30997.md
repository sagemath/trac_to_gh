Keywords: coercion

For matrices with zero columns or rows and different base rings (at least when double fields are involved), multiplication fails:

```
sage: matrix.identity(QQ, 4) * matrix(RDF, 4, 0)
...
ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).

sage: matrix.identity(RDF, 4) * matrix(QQ, 4, 0)
...
ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).

sage: matrix(QQ, 0, 4) * matrix.identity(RDF, 4)
...
ValueError: matrix is immutable; please change a copy instead (i.e., use copy(M) to change a copy of M).
```


Using `copy()`, as suggested, does not work.

At least one issue in `change_ring` about subdivisions:


```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)

coming from here

```

I have found the problem. In `matrix_double_dense.pyx`, the corresponding `_matrix_times_matrix_` has the following:

```
        if self._nrows == 0 or self._ncols == 0 or right._nrows == 0 or right._ncols == 0:
            return self.matrix_space(self._nrows, right._ncols).zero_matrix()
```

So the result is the *immutable* zero matrix. Compare:

```
sage: matrix.identity(RDF, 4) * matrix(RDF, 4, 0)
[]
sage: _.is_mutable()
False
sage: matrix.identity(QQ, 4) * matrix(QQ, 4, 0)
[]
sage: _.is_mutable()
True
```

I think the most consistent thing is to return an immutable matrix. So that is what I changed it to.

maybe we can also take the opportunity to fix the un-necessary subdivision ?

It looks like this is not a problem.


```
sage: A = matrix.identity(QQ, 4)
sage: A.subdivisions()
([], [])
sage: A.subdivide(A.subdivisions())
sage: A.subdivisions()
([], [])
```


I assume that `A._subdivisions` contains `[0, 4]` just because it makes it more conventient to work with, internally.

Thank you for the fix. I have removed some trailing whitespace. Other than that, this looks good to me, so I am setting this to positive.
