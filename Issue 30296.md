Somebody want to come up with `usage()` strings for the other options? I'm not really sure what they're meant to do.

My understanding is:


```
  -d        download a pre-made `configure` script
  -D        download and ensure future invocations will download too
  -s        save the `configure` script
  -u <URL>  use <URL> as the download url for a pre-made `configure` script
  -?        print this help and exit with an error
```

All good now, I hope. The output should be hidden from `./bootstrap -s -q` and `./bootstrap -D -q` now too.

Actually the change from `bash` to `/bin/sh` seems to have changed the `set -e` default, and `bootstrap` no longer works if `src/bin/sage-env-config` does not already exist.
