My understanding is:


```
  -d        download a pre-made `configure` script
  -D        download and ensure future invocations will download too
  -s        save the `configure` script
  -u <URL>  use <URL> as the download url for a pre-made `configure` script
  -?        print this help and exit with an error
```
