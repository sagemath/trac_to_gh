(from #29626)

With a fresh tarball, `sage --pip install PKG` doesn't do what I want: since I'm using the system Python, it installs the package in the system location, not in SAGE_ROOT/local/..

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29627

`sage -pip` just calls `sage-python -m pip`.

In fact, `sage -python` should probably exit with an error if the venv (or Sage's python) has not been created yet.
