# Issue 30514: Iteration over infinite abelian groups

Given an AbelianGroup with infinite order generators the `__iter__` method silently returns an empty iterator.


```
sage: for a in AbelianGroup(1,[0]):
....:     print(a)
```

gives no output.

Either an error should be raised (like for the list method), or ideally an iterator over all elements (by lexicographic order of the powers of generators should be returned, as for


```
sage: for a in ZZ:
....:     print(a)
....:     if a^2 + a == 30:
....:         break
```
