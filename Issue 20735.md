# Issue 20735: Add certificate to is_relatively_complemented()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20972

Original creator: jmantysalo

At #20940 Kevin Dilks suggested a `certificate`-option, which I did. For consistency I guess that other functions should have the same option too. This patch adds it to `is_relatively_complemented()`.

I think the `INPUT:` block should just say:

```
- ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) whether to return a certificate if
  ``self`` is not relatively complemented
```

and then put the description of the certificate/output in an `OUTPUT:` block. Similar for #20940.

Can be done, of course, but I guess that then at least `is_dismantlable()` should be changed too. What about `breadth()` of a lattice? See also `is_chordal()` and `is_circulant()` in generic graphs.

Is it possible to accept this and #20940, and then later change docstrings for those? Also we should think if `certify` at `canonical_label()` of graphs should be changed to `certificate`.

I think it is better to do this to new functionality in those tickets and then change the other docstrings in a separate ticket. This keeps changes local to the ticket, as well as we don't introduce something that is worse and we are just going to change one moment latter. This has a slight disadvantage of making the doc be less consistent, but Sage is not known for its doc consistency ;). (Yes, I know that is somewhat of a double standard, but the locality of change is the differentiating factor.)

Although my opinion on this is not very strong. If you think doc consistency is more important than doc correctness (or at least separation of concerns within the doc), then we can leave it alone.

Do you mean something like this?

Whatever. In any case we will need documentation polishing tickets sometimes, as functions will have diverse format for same things.

I would prefer if it is one bullet point, but that's only because I would use separate bullet points for different parts when the output is a tuple. Also, that is so stylistic and minor that I'll leave that decision to you.

I am not sure what you mean. Something like this?
