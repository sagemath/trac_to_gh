Jean-Pierre: can you replace the copy command with something that works?

Mmmmm....
Sorry about that one.
Does it know `cp -r`?

Yes it does from the ticket description.

Changing keywords from "" to "solaris cp bzip2".

No time to actually test it now.
At least `cp -r -f` works on a quick test on a Solaris system.

The solution for problems with `cp` at #14166 and #14236 was to use `tar` instead of `cp`.
