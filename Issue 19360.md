`combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.py`: a very strange way to compute powers `self * self ** (n-1)`. I guess that generic power would be better here!

`groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py`: Is there any difference between `list(L)` and `[x for x in L]`? As far as I understand `list` is smarter and call for `__len__` to allocate directly the right amount of memory. Whereas the second uses `.append`.

Let me also mention that this is the only place in Sage where a comparison method `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__` or `__ge__` returns `NotImplemented`.

In `src/sage/combinat/words/abstract_word.py`, there is an `__eq__` which can return `NotImplemented`, but I don't think there is a problem there: I believe calling `self == other` in `__ne__` is still the right thing to do.

And there are several other places where a `__richcmp__` can return `NotImplemented` but those are not affected by this ticket.

Well, there wasn't a single non-optional doctest for `str(<libgap object>)`.

The issue is fixed at #19733 and needs review.
