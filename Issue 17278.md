Using the email command is nice.

```
sage: email('root@localhost', 'hi', 'test')
Child process 9360 is sending email to root@localhost...
sage: Successfully sent an email to root@localhost.
```

Except that it isn't clear that the `sage:` prompt is actually usable.  Is there any way to make the prompt print after the message, or this is essentially some kind of race condition?

> Is there any way to make the prompt print after the message
Use the `block=True` argument :-)

This behaviour in intentional. From the source code:

```
    if not block:
        # Do a non-block sendmail, which is typically what a user wants, since it can take
        # a while to send an email.
```

Well, if it's intentional I suppose this is okay, but it still is confusing.  Do you have any other ideas for how to deal with this?  When I saw

```
sage: Successfully sent an email to root@localhost.
```

I was worried that typing anything at all would cause problems, much less `return` for a new prompt.

Well, the function is really meant for the notebook (it's defined in `sagenb/notebook/sage_email.py`) and then I guess the output just comes at the end of the cell where it's executed.

Perhaps one could make the default `block=True` except in the notebook? That would be easy to implement.

Okay.  But at least it would be nice to have an addition to the message if one is not embedded, to say you can keep using the command line.  If you have ideas about the sagenb thing of course that would be great too.

Like I said, the easiest solution there would be to use `block=True` by default.
