# Issue 34580: Parking functions in sets and lists behave differently

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34817

I have no clue what's going on here.

```
sage: P = ParkingFunctions(3)
sage: f = P([1,1,1])
sage: g = ParkingFunction([1,1,1])
sage: f in P
True
sage: g in P
True
sage: f in set(P)
True
sage: g in set(P)
False
```

note that `f` and `g` have different parents:

```
sage: f.parent()
Parking functions of size 3
sage: g.parent()
Parking functions
```

now you have `f in set(P)`, so all parents of elements of `set(P)` should be `Parking functions of size 3`. So `g` is not there as it has a different parent.

I accidentally opened #34824, which now deals with the issue.  Sorry.
