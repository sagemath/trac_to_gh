# Issue 29817: Factorize code in Polynomials and Ore Polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30054

After #29629, we propose to make the Polynomial class should inherit from the abstract class SkewPolynomial (since a lot of codes is shared between these two classes and a normal polynomial is just a skew polynomial under the identity map).

Any comment?
