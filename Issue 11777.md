Here it is ! It cost me several nights along with my first evening in Belgium, but it works ! `;-)`

This patch implements a new interface between Sage and Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com)

YEAH !

(and now I'm going out ! `:-D`)

I tried this patch in 4.8.alpha0 for many examples, for which I previously used the Coin-cbc solver or the standalone versions of scip and gurobi via the mps-export of the linear program. It seems to work fine with Gurobi versions 4.5 and 4.6. The docs are updated, and the thematic tutorial on linear programming explains well how to make gurobi visible to sage.

It's great that this powerful solver (for which one can get a free academic license) can now be used from inside Sage.

You should change "optional - required GUROBI" to "optional - GUROBI"

There are some issues with the documentation:

```
dochtml.log:/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-4.8.alpha2/devel/sage/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.rst:521: WARNING: Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

```
