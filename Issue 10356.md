# Issue 10356: merge_vertices does not respect loops

If a graph allows loops, then merge_vertices maybe should have an option to put a loop on the merged vertex if there was either an edge between the vertices, or maybe if the merged vertices formed a complete graph.  

In my case, I'm merging two vertices, so either case would be the same thing.
