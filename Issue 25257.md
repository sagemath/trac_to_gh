Keywords: function field

Our current function field code is being revised (Trac #22982 is a meta-ticket tracking this progress).

This ticket adds support to the new code for using the optional `kash` package as an `implementation` option.

The major advantage of Kash is that supports infinite coefficient fields (i.e, `QQ` and number fields), while our current native code only works over finite fields.

Kash should also be useful for double-checking our results as the native implemention moves forward.

Using this code requires the `kash` package to be installed, i.e, run


```
sage -i kash
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
