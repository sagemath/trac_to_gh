General +1 to this change, but see comment 4 of #24438. In particular, having a `_keys` means the iteration order for `FiniteFamily` is fixed, and I think the repr should reflect that.

You could avoid some duplication (and inconsistency in string formatting methods) by writing this like:


```python
if self._keys:
    d = ', '.join('{}: {}'.format(saferepr(key),
                                  saferepr(self._dictionary[key]))
                  for key in self._keys)
else:
    d = ' '.join(pformat(self._dictionary)[1:-1].splitlines())

return 'Finite family ``'.format(d)
```


or similar.


Travis, does this address the problems with #24438?  I haven't checked carefully.  Doesn't this version mean that elements not in the `keys` argument won't be displayed at all?  Is that desirable?

My understanding is this ticket would be another way to fix #24438, but a nuance may be lost on me.

So it has to do with the fact that roots and coroots are incomparable, hence `sorted` is random but the underlying dict is small enough that it doesn't visibly suffer from this. What we should do is just add a fixed set of keys. So for `str_keys`, it would be

```
keys = (['e{}'.format(i) for i in index_set] + ['f{}'.format(i) for i in index_set]
        + ['h{}'.format(i) for i in index_set])
```

and the other case would be

```
keys = ([alpha[i] for i in index_set] + [-alpha[i] for i in index_set]
        + [alphacheck[i] for i in index_set])
```

and then

```
Family(keys, ret.__getitem__)
```
