# Issue 14757: Direct product for finitely presented groups

Keywords: group presentations, direct product

Implementation for the wrapping of GAP's `DirectProduct` function for finitely presented groups. 

```
sage: G = FreeGroup()
sage: C3 = G / [G([1,1,1])]
sage: C3.direct_product(C3)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^3, b^3, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
```

My approach is object oriented as a `FinitelyPresentedGroup` method, as opposed to a function call such as `direct_product_fpgroups` taking a list of groups as input.
Depends on #14790 for variable names.

Also fixed some spelling errors in sage/groups/finitely_presented.py

1.  On 5.11.beta3, I get a doctest error for


```
C7.direct_product(C6).is_isomorphic(C14.direct_product(C3)) 
```


that indicates the `is_isomorphic` is missing.  Is my version too old, or does this have a missing dependency?

2.  If you have to rebase or edit at any point, you might move spelling errors to another ticket.  Otherwise, other changes elsewhere might give you some rebasing pain as this patch moves through the review/relase process.

Added missing dependencies and got rid of spelling fixes.

Still working on implementation of some features, not yet ready for review.

Here's a small review patch which just tweaks the documentation. If you agree with my changes, you can go ahead and set this to positive review.

Review patch looks good, I'll try and propagate the changes through my other patches needing review.
