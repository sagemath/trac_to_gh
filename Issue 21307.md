# Issue 21307: LatticePoset: Add is_join_distributive (and dual)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21544

This patch will add function to check if a lattice is join-distributive. (And dually, if it is meet-distributive.)

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I hope that a reviewer can check this and then return to _needs_work_. This is not yet in the index of functions and the dual function is missing; however, it is trivial to do if this one is accepted.

Daniel, want to review something?

Daniel seems to be away. Travis?

Two small things: `iter.next()` to `next(iter)` and remove the comma here `Return ``True`` if the lattice is join-distributive, and ``False`` otherwise.`

Replying to [comment:5 tscrim]:
> Two small things: `iter.next()` to `next(iter)`

This again... corrected.

> and remove the comma here `Return ``True`` if the lattice is join-distributive, and ``False`` otherwise.`

Duh. Done, but this exactly same phrase is used in about 20 functions. This is one more reason to have a "prototype" of specific kind of functions.

More to do?

Nope. Positive review.

I'll add the dual function `is_meet_distributive` to this, but I guess I must wait for next beta to get the index of functions done.

Maybe this can be added now; I will try to remember to add links to index of functions in some following ticket.

Travis, can you check another half? It is direct copy of `is_join_distributive()` that you already reviewed, just everything conversed to dual. (+ seealso-links added)

LGTM.
