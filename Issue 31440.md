Various places in the code assumed that the elements of the `_supersets` attribute of an open set are open, but this is not a guaranteed invariant.

We fix this by updating all loops over supersets that need to make this assumption to use a new generator function `ManifoldSubset.open_supersets`. 

We also add the method `ManifoldSubset.open_subset`. It delegates to its base manifold's `open_subset` method, by passing a new optional parameter `supersets` to it.
