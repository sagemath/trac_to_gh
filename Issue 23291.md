Keywords: unicode

Unicode that coerces to str is OK in terminal mode:


```
sage: table([ [u'test'] ])
  test
```


Unicode that coerces to str looks bad in html and latex mode{


```
sage: html(table([ [u'test'] ]))

<div class="notruncate">
<table  class="table_form">
<tbody>
<tr class ="row-a">
<td><script type="math/tex">\text{\texttt{test}}</script></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
```


Unicode that doesn't coerce to str booms:


```
sage: html(table([ [u'tæst'] ]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeEncodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)

UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe6' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

Yes, I see the problem.  There are a few explicit `str()` calls in the `sage.misc.table` code, at least one of which is definitely wrong for treating unicode properly.  Incidentally this works fine on Python 3 since `str` is `unicode` :)

The problem with `LatexExpr` is slightly different, since the class itself inherits from `str`, so if we want it to support unicode properly on Python 2 we really need to make it a subclass of `unicode`.  I think I'll open a separate ticket for that.

On third thought, the latex module needs some other work in general, including on Python 3, so maybe I will do that separately and make this a dependency of a new ticket.
