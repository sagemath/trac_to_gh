I see. In Python 2, `range()` automatically calls `int()` on the arguments:

```
sage: range(1.5, 6.5)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Python 3 uses `__index__` which is obviously better.

This is not a harmless change:

```diff
-        return self.eval_helper(max_symbolic, builtin_max, None, args)
+        return self.eval_helper(max_symbolic, builtin_max, float('-inf'), args)
```

Instead, I think you just need to handle `None` in `eval_helper`. In particular in this line:

```
res = builtin_f(res, x)
```


Second, I would just remove the doctests involving `None` where you added `# py2`. Those tests seem rather silly. But it's fine if you want to keep them.

Everything else is fine.

I agree the `None` tests are a bit silly, but they did help catch this issue in the first place (they won't in the future due to the `# py2` addition, but I think I'll keep them). I agree otherwise.

But on the other hand, there is already `float('inf')` in the `min_symbolic`

So this ticket is good for coherence..

I see that now, and I think it may be where I got the idea in the first place.  But in principle `float('inf')` doesn't necessarily always make sense here, so it would be better to use `None` but in a way that makes sense on Python 3.
