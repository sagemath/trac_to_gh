The option `export` of the command `sage --notebook`, introduced in #19877, is missing from the output of `sage --advanced`. Besides neither `export` nor `jupyter` appears in the section *Command-line options for Sage* of the reference manual. The current ticket corrects this. It also adds an example of use of `export` in the output of `sage --notebook --help`.
