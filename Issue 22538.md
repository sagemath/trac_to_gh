conway_polynomials depends on sagelib, so the latter has be become inport-able into python3 first.

Arguably this is a bad state of affairs, conway_polynomials should just use some Sage-independent format to serialize itself (e.g. plain Python pickles / sqlite / ...).

By the way, trying to import sage in my python3-sage build, I get

```

So it seems that there is some problem with the cython extensions..
