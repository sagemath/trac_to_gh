Keywords: as_permutation_group, coercion

This ticket follows up #25706 which left a problem for the case where `as_permutation_group` is called with a keyword argument.

Example:


```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
False
sage: g1, g2 = G.gens()
sage: P(g1*g2)

sage: P1(g1*g2)

The example of the description is not reproducible with version 8.6 (but still has been with 8.5). I guess this is caused by the upgrade to GAP 4.10.
It seems that the result of `as_permutation_group` doesn't depend on wether the option is set or not, any more (I didn't find a counter example).


```
sage: G = Sp(4,3)
sage: P  = G.as_permutation_group(algorithm='smaller')
sage: P1 = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: P1 == P
True
```


But anyway, I think we should take into account that an option of that method, produces different results. Thus, there is no way out to have that fixed.
Now, that we have `GroupHomomorphim_libgap` working for permutation groups, as well (by #26750), the best way to do that is to rewrite #25706
in the sense of #26750 by using the natural map of the homset.

This is what I pushed to this ticket!

Yes there are many randomized algorithms in GAP, and I think even more since the upgrade to GAP 4.10, which caused many problems in testing as well.

If you want to get a "reproducible" result, one way is to call `libgap.set_seed(N)` to some specific RNG seed.  It's unfortunate though since it's not immediately obvious, at least to users, when these interfaces are using GAP (though it's good to document that if it isn't).

Indeed, according to the GAP documentation the following is not a bug:


```
sage: G = SO(4,3,-1)
sage: libgap.set_seed(0)
0
sage: P = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: for i in range(10):

```


But, is it reasonable to the user, that you have to repeat a statement 6 times to obtain a non trivial result? Maybe, this is o.k. for GAP users.

You could limit the loop by an optional argument and explain the problem in its documentation.

Sure, I did not mean to solve the randomness. But that would improve the chance to find a reduced degree representation. But, that was just a suggestion!

>So I think we have to follow GAP here, but we might want to better document this.

I will try to do that in #27143 !

What's wrong with having a (largish? smallish?) default number of iterations, with an option to increase it/decrease it as needed (along with appropriate documentation).

The longer I think about that, the less I understand why `SmallerDegreePermutationRepresentation` is integrated in `as_permutation_group`. Wouldn't it be better to wrap this separately by a method (named `reduce_degree`, for instance) of `PermutationGroup_generic`?
That would have several advantages:

1) It could be used for other permutation groups, as well.

2) The documentation about that strange random behavior, could be better focused.

3) You could recurs as long as the the degree is reduced (not meaning that it will become unique, finally).

This method should return `None` if no reduction was possible and with two optional arguments `seed=None, repeat=0` you could pass the optimization to the user.
