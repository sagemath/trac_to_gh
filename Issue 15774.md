Keywords: relative number field ramification

Computing torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over relative number fields fails:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: F.<a> = QuadraticField(5)
sage: K.<b> = F.extension(x^2-3)
sage: E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,0,0,b,1])
sage: E.torsion_subgroup()
...
NotImplementedError: For an ideal in a relative number field you must use relative_ramification_index or absolute_ramification_index as appropriate
```

The solution should be to make `E._torsion_bound()` use `absolute_ramification_index()` instead of `ramification_index()`.

Looks good (and very quick)!  One non-essential comment on your patch: the preferred way of referring to Trac tickets is `:trac:`16011`` instead of `#16011`.
