Introduced in #11754, this currently causes problems with #12659 as there is a `\_\_init\_\_.py` file in this directory and a corresponding extension module `rankwidth.pyx`.

I have installed the patch on sage-5.0.beta8 and everything is in order (compilation, docbuild,...).

I give positive review.

David.

I have installed version 2 of the patch on sage-5.0.beta9 and everything is in order (change in directory name, compilation, docbuild, long tests, functionality, etc.).
