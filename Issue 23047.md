CC:  @roed314 @saraedum

On my laptop, doing the long doctests of `src/sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py` takes about 1300 seconds, which is a **huge** amount of time.

Some of these tests are quite old, so either this is a regression or something else is wrong...

Why do you need separate runs of `TestSuite` here?

```
sage: TestSuite(R).run()
sage: TestSuite(R).run(elements = [R.random_element() for i in range(2^10)], max_runs = 2^12, skip='_test_metric') # long time
sage: R._test_metric(elements = [R.random_element() for i in range(2^3)]) # long time
```

Why is `TestSuite(R).run()` not sufficient?
