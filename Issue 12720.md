I find the first patch a bit difficult to understand due to mixing several things defining the embedding: a cone and two dictionaries of rays. Also `defining_cone` argument is not documented in the constructor of the orbit morphism.

Orbits are in 1:1 correspondence with cones of the original fan, so it makes perfect sense to pass this information and store it (as it is currently done in the patch).

Mathematically, this is all that is needed, but since we have so far issues with supporting quotient lattices and instead the fan of the orbit lives in a "regular lattice", we need to keep the correspondence somehow. As it is done by some matrix, perhaps that's what we need to pass to the constructor and store.

Instead, the current version constructs a codomain_ray->domain_ray dictionary, it is passed to the constructor and constructor reverses it into domain_ray->codomain_index dictionary. Note that the map does not have to be one-to-one for non-simplicial fans, so this dictionary just picks some random representative for a domain ray. The choice may affect the decision on whether embedding can be realized as a polynomial map or not.

I also think it is confusing to store non-primitive generators for rays and treat a ray as not found if a non-primitive generator is found. We do represent rays throughout the code just by their generators, but it is always assumed that they are normalized.

As a feature request it would be nice to have support for maps given by homogeneous polynomials in the other direction, i.e. a map from the 12 orbit of P112 to P1 can be given as (0:z1:z2) -> (z1^2:z2) and this will work for all orbits with powers corresponding to that "non-primitivity of generators". Or is it already implemented and I am missing something?

Anyway, concretely: how about passing and storing `defining_cone` and `projection_matrix` as base pieces of data and relying on them for consecutive computations?

There were failures due to the switch to `PointCollection`, I've fixed them (added `__add__`).

How about the following?
* `fiber_generic()` returns (X, N) where X is a toric variety corresponding to the kernel fan and N is the number of copies if the whole torus of the codomain is covered surjectively and 0 otherwise.
* `fiber_component(domain_cone)` returns (X, N) where N is always some positive number of copies, since here we specify a domain cone and there are definitely some components corresponding to it, in particular `fiber_component(domain_origin)` will return the number of components of the fiber over distinguished point of the `codomain_origin`, even if `fiber_generic` returns (X, 0), meaning that over non-distinguished points there are likely empty fibers.
* `fiber_dimension(codomain_cone)` returns -1 (or -intinity?) if the corresponding orbit of the codomain is not covered surjectively.
* `fiber_graph(codomain_cone)` returns an empty graph is the corresponding orbit is not covered surjectively.

I (still) think its unwieldy to try to support non-surjective "fibrations". A fibration is a surjective morphism, otherwise its useless to describe "fibers" fitting into some familiy parametrized by the base. Its would be much easier to just raise some error in `fiber_...()` methods if the morphism is not surjective. 

It seems like there is a natural way to factor a morphism into a surjection and an injection, first map to the image fan and then embed the image in the codomain. The error raised in the `fiber_...()` methods could direct the users then to do this.

{
    "body": "Well, what exactly do you mean by \"fibration\"? Fiber bundle? Fibration in the sense of `is_fibration` with all fibers having the same dimension? That excludes even blowups. Anything surjective? That excludes e.g. chart inclusion, or maps from charts of blowups into the original variety. I think for any morphism it is reasonable to look at fibers over any point of the codomain, it is just the inverse image. And whether we return something special or raise an exception, we still have to do the work of figuring out what's going on.\n\nFrom the user point of view, I think it is a bit easier/more elegant to handle \"corner case\" outputs than exceptions, `fiber_component` and `fiber_dimension` have pretty clear meaning in general. I think `fiber_generic` has it as well. The `fiber_graph` one is indeed quite special and maybe it makes sense to restrict it to surjective or even `is_fibration` case.\n\nIn the case of factoring through the image, the middle variety can be difficult to work with and I am not even sure if the current support is sufficient for any work as well. Then again for the inclusion there is a question of what is covered and what is not, and the natural test seems to be - are there points of this point or not, but if fiber methods don't work, then there should be something separate. I think it will be more complicated.\n\nE.g. take a blowup of a plane and consider the map from one of the charts to the plane. How will it factor???

Well, what exactly do you mean by "fibration"? Fiber bundle? Fibration in the sense of `is_fibration` with all fibers having the same dimension? That excludes even blowups. Anything surjective? That excludes e.g. chart inclusion, or maps from charts of blowups into the original variety. I think for any morphism it is reasonable to look at fibers over any point of the codomain, it is just the inverse image. And whether we return something special or raise an exception, we still have to do the work of figuring out what's going on.

From the user point of view, I think it is a bit easier/more elegant to handle "corner case" outputs than exceptions, `fiber_component` and `fiber_dimension` have pretty clear meaning in general. I think `fiber_generic` has it as well. The `fiber_graph` one is indeed quite special and maybe it makes sense to restrict it to surjective or even `is_fibration` case.

In the case of factoring through the image, the middle variety can be difficult to work with and I am not even sure if the current support is sufficient for any work as well. Then again for the inclusion there is a question of what is covered and what is not, and the natural test seems to be - are there points of this point or not, but if fiber methods don't work, then there should be something separate. I think it will be more complicated.

E.g. take a blowup of a plane and consider the map from one of the charts to the plane. How will it factor??? I suspect clear factorization into surjection and injection requires working with complete fans and that's definitely way too restrictive.

```
Fan([ Cone([(1,0),(1,1)]) ])

That's what you have suggested earlier and this is also the factorization used in HLY paper. The intermediate variety is clearly defined: intersect the codomain fan with the linear subspace spanned by the map of lattices. Works fine when both fans of domain/codomain are complete.

Now for the blowup chart you propose to replace a map between two affine varieties induced by the identity matrix with a reverse factorization - first inclusion, then surjection, going through an intermediate non-affine variety. How is this intermediate variety defined/constructed in general?

How about this compromise between surjective/general morphisms support - compute fibers only for dominant ones. For a toric morphism being dominant implies:
* surjection between tori, thus
* surjection onto any torus orbit if it was hit at all, so
* fiber/preimage over any point of any orbit is the same, including the case when it is empty.
So there is no confusion with returning something when distinguished points have something over them and some others don't. In terms of #14353 factorization, this means supporting compositions of surjective and birational factors, but throwing exceptions if the last injective factor is not an identity map on tori/lattices.

In particular, a blowup chart will be supported with single point fiber over the torus, single point fiber over one of the axis, empty fiber over another axis, and an affine line fiber over the origin. Awesome example for some intro classes ;-)

Thinking of making `aris` (a variant of spelling arris, "the sharp edge or salient angle formed by the meeting of two surfaces especially in moldings") an alias for `ambient_ray_indices` ;-) Would make doctest a bit shorter.

Still have a bug in fan isomorphism and another one in representing morphisms as polynomial maps. Problems tend to stem from either fans/morphisms involving sublattices, which seem to be easy to fix, or from not dealing properly with torus factors, which are more involved.
