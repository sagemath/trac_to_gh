There are a few inconsistencies in using the `solve` command with `algorithm="sympy"`. It seems to be a problem with translating solutions from sympy to sage.

----

The following two commands should return the same result (the first one):

```
sage: solve([x], [x], algorithm="sympy")       # correct
[x == 0]
sage: solve([x, x], [x], algorithm="sympy")    # incorrect
[{x: 0}]
```

as should the following two:

```
sage: solve([x], [x], algorithm="sympy", solution_dict=True)      # incorrect
[x == 0]
sage: solve([x, x], [x], algorithm="sympy", solution_dict=True)   # correct
[{x: 0}]
```


----

Here is an example where the output of `solve` does not agree with the output of sympy's `solve`:

```
sage: var('y')
sage: solve([y], [x, y], algorithm="sympy")       # incorrect
[]

sage: from sympy import solve as sympy_solve      # correct
sage: sympy_solve([y], [x, y])
{y: 0}
```
