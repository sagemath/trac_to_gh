As discussed in 
[this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/54cde75b815ced40#), currently the choice of plot points differs each time plot is called unless you turn randomization off, in which case you re-introduce the possibility of the problems that randomization was introduced to avoid.  

This isn't a major problem, but that the points differ from call to call makes some natural things you might want to do fail, such as caching function values to speed up plotting.  Right now it can be worked around easily enough by setting the random seed to something each time outside the plotting calls.

It seems equally sensible, and probably slightly more useful, to have the default behaviour be the use of a local fixed seed, which gives reproducibility while avoiding the pitfalls of the non-randomized approach.
