My guess is that it depends on the order of the doctests and `Integers(15)` never being cleared from the cache:

```
sage: Integers(15, is_field=True)
Ring of integers modulo 15
sage: Integers(15).fraction_field()
Ring of integers modulo 15
6738
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: Integers(15).fraction_field()
Ring of integers modulo 15
```

Your commit looks good to me and fixes the doctest at hand.

However the actual issue has something very subtle going on. Something strange is happening here:

```
sage: x = 20
sage: Integers(x).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: Integers(x, is_field=True).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: gc.collect()
186
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: Integers(x).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
```

However, then doing the commands in comment:2 nails any of these in memory. We also have this:

```
sage: Integers(int(20), is_field=True).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: Integers(int(20)).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: gc.collect()
136
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: Integers(int(20)).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
```

Even more strangeness as this works:

```
sage: Integers(Integer(20)).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
sage: Integers(Integer(20), is_field=True).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: gc.collect()
251
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: Integers(Integers(20)).category()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unable to coerce <class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod_ring.IntegerModRing_generic_with_category'> to an integer
sage: Integers(Integer(20)).category()
Join of Category of finite commutative rings and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups and Category of finite enumerated sets
```

versus this which doesn't:

```
sage: Integers(Integer(20), is_field=True).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: gc.collect()
64
sage: gc.collect()
0
sage: Integers(Integer(20)).category()
Join of Category of finite fields and Category of subquotients of monoids and Category of quotients of semigroups
sage: Integers(Integers(20)).category()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...

sage: Integers(Integer(20)).category()

```
