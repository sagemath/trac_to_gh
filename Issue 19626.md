# Issue 19626: Static error rate channel does not always add as many errors as expected

I noticed the following:


```
V = VectorSpace(GF(2), 2)
Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(V, 1)
for i in range(100):
    c = V.random_element()
    r = Chan(c)
    assert c != r

AssertionError
```


This is due to a line in the `transmit_unsafe` methods which replaces values of the transmitted vector by random values picked from the base ring of the transmitted vector.
It works with high probability for big rings, but obviously not for my example.

In any case, it does not respect the promised behaviour and thus should be fixed.

Could you add something like your code as a test? E.g. something like


```
V = VectorSpace(GF(2), 1000)
Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(V, 367)
assert (c - Chan.transmit(c)).hamming_weight() == 367
```



Otherwise, the code looks good, builds fine and passes.

Oh, I guess the doctest is better written with output instead of assert:
