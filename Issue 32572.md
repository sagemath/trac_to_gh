The method `._coerce_()` belongs to the deprecated parent `sage.structure.parent_old.Parent`. Nevertheless, it is called in many places in sage source code

```
$ git grep -l '\._coerce_('
misc/functional.py
quadratic_forms/quadratic_form__evaluate.pyx
rings/complex_double.pyx
rings/finite_rings/element_pari_ffelt.pyx
rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx
rings/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx
rings/finite_rings/integer_mod_ring.py
rings/integer.pyx
rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py
rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx

rings/polynomial/polynomial_integer_dense_ntl.pyx
rings/polynomial/polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx
rings/polynomial/polynomial_template.pxi
rings/polynomial/polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx
rings/power_series_ring.py
rings/qqbar.py
rings/rational.pyx
rings/rational_field.py
rings/real_mpfi.pyx
schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py
structure/parent_old.pyx
symbolic/expression.pyx
symbolic/ring.pyx
```

This ticket stands for
- replacing `_coerce_() -> coerce()`
- deprecating `_coerce_()`

Ideally, it would be good to have some rings that do not inherit from this old parent class. This is currently impossible : defining a ring as `class MyRing(Parent)` forbid its usage as the base ring of a multivariate polynomial ring, see https://gitlab.com/jo314schmitt/admcycles/-/issues/70.

Now remains only

```
git grep -l '\._coerce_('
rings/polynomial/pbori/pbori.pyx
structure/parent_base.pyx
structure/parent_old.pyx
```


and the one in pbori is commented out.
