Like #21442, but check for being (weakly) connected as a subgraph.

Could be `is_connected_and_convex()`, but these might be useful as own functions.

Quite trivial review. Travis?

I disagree with that this not testing the, as you call it, induced poset. If you are testing a subposet, it is by definition "induced." So IMO this method will cause confusion, even with the semi-documented behavior.

OK. Suggestions for better name? Or just to drop this and make it a part of function doing Alan Kay doubling construction?

I was wondering if you were planning on using this as part of some other construction. I think having this functionality for subposets (without having to explicitly construct said subposet) would be useful. I lean towards making this a helper function of the doubling construction as I don't see a useful independent use for this method, but I'm not a complete expert in posets. I'm cc-ing Kevin to see if he has an opinion on this.

Done that on #21606 (kind of...), so I suggest this one to closed.
