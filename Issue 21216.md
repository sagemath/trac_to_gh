Like #21442, but check for being (weakly) connected as a subgraph.

Could be `is_connected_and_convex()`, but these might be useful as own functions.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21453

I disagree with that this not testing the, as you call it, induced poset. If you are testing a subposet, it is by definition "induced." So IMO this method will cause confusion, even with the semi-documented behavior.

Done that on #21606 (kind of...), so I suggest this one to closed.
