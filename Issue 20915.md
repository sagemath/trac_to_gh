# Issue 20915: Implement unary operations in interfaces

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21152

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-08-03 10:37:35

Currently, Sage relies on the default implementations from `RingElement` for unary operations for interface elements. Instead, we should directly implement unary operations in `InterfaceElement` analogous to the binary operations. Maxima already does this.
