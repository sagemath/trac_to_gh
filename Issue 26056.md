There is a change I haven't done yet but want an opinion on:

There are two functions (`row_shape_to_linked_skew_partitions` and `size_to_linked_skew_partitions`) which I haven't fit into the standard object-oriented organization...

I think the most appropriate thing would be to create a new class `LinkedSkewPartition` which subclasses `SkewPartition` and merely adds the additional restriction `is_linked` to the constructor.  There would also be a class called `LinkedSkewPartitions` which would have the methods `init_from_row_shape` and `init_from_size`, which would be my two functions.

Let me know if you think this is a good idea.
