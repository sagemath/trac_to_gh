I assume the only commit to be reviewed here is this one: https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=5ad29d5e5686a403f51d6b09d5ba0ea02face4e9

I see that it simplifies the code by removing two `if ... fi` clauses twice.

Do you accept to add a commit which unindent twice the content of the two for loops?
