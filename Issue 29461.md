It does have the hints of that as the trace monoid is the monoid version of a right-angled Artin group. Although this implementation is quite different IMO.

Do you need to use `len` in these tests ?

```diff
+        if len(m) == 0:
+            return '1'
+        term = ''
+        for i in m:
+            if len(term) != 0:
+                term += '*'
+            term += 'e' + str(i)
+        return term
```

Indeed, I do not. I can also use `join()` as well.

Looks good.
I am just so slightly worried about the pdf doc, but was not able to check that it works.
Let me give a positive review nevertheless.
