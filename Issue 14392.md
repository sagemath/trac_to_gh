Keywords: pari optional spkg

It would be useful to have an optional spkg to make it easy to install the optional pari large seadata package.  This is used in point counting on elliptic curves over large prime fields (primes over 350 bits), and consists of data precomputed by David Kohel for his Magma Echidna package.

One merely has to download http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/packages/seadata.tgz and unpack it into SAGE_ROOT/local/share/pari/seadata so the spkg will be very easy.

A little harder would be to catch cases where the default installation fails and output a helpful message to the user suggesting that installing this additional package would be a good idea.  At 19MB we probably do not want to include this as standard, since there may be some Sage users who will never want to count points on elliptic curves.

`spkg-check` looks a bit funny.   First, it depends on the Sage library, second, it uses `-tp`, and even runs the tests in verbose mode (without any additional message referring to the database(s) subject to installation).




Since this is an optional spkg, I'd not rely on `SAGE_SRC` (and `SAGE_SHARE`, which you don't use [yet]) being defined, both being relatively new, but use `${SAGE_SRC:-${SAGE_ROOT}/devel/sage}` etc. instead, or do

```sh
[[ -z "$SAGE_SRC" ]] && SAGE_SRC="${SAGE_ROOT}/devel/sage"

[[ -z "$SAGE_SHARE" ]] && SAGE_SHARE="${SAGE_LOCAL}/share"
```


(Then I'd use `"${SAGE_SHARE}/pari/" as the destination directory.)

I'd also rather use `gp` in `spkg-check`, or do some simpler sanity check on the installed files.

Well, why use `-p`?  Why verbose?  Especially the combination seems weird.

(Hopefully the doctesting framework doesn't parse the `--long` into a number of threads, don't know.)

If installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` (probably not specifically set for that installation) requires the Sage library (or likewise, perhaps `gp`), you can't (successfully) install it in advance.

IMHO unnecessary pitfalls.

Because I expect

env SAGE_CHECK=yes MAKE="make -j20" ./sage -i database_pari
```

to use 20 threads, both for installing (which is pointless for this spkg) and for testing.

> Why verbose?
Because one test takes an annoyingly long time (about 2 minutes), and with `--verbose` you will at least see something happening, at least the message "# long time" should be seen. But I can certainly change this if it means positive_review.

> Hopefully the doctesting framework doesn't parse the `--long` into a number of threads
No, it doesn't.

> If installing it with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` requires the Sage library (or likewise, perhaps `gp`), you can't (successfully) install it in advance.
Another true statement... many optional packages cannot be installed "in advance", so why would this be a problem?

I checked that the spkg builds ok and the patch applies to sage-5.10.beta3.  Unfortunately when I then did "make ptestlong" it decided that it needed to build GCC from scratch (which was not the case when I built Sage originally) and after that it needed to rebuild all the rest of Sage (roughly) so the test has not even started yet a couple of hours later.

I don't know why this happened but it is clearly not the fault of anything on this ticket.

All tests pass, and I also tested installing the spkg with SAGE_CHECK=yes, and doctesting the patched file before and after installing the spkg.  Positive review.
