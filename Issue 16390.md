# Issue 16390: Slight inconsistency in base ring of polytope doc

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: beginner


```
sage: P8 = polytopes.n_cube(4)
sage: P8.base_ring?
Type:            instancemethod
String form:     <bound method Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category.element_class.base_ring of A 4-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 16 vertices>
Definition:      P8.base_ring(self)
Docstring:
   Return the base ring.

   OUTPUT:

   Either "QQ" (exact arithmetic using gmp, default) or "RDF" (double
   precision floating-point arithmetic)

   EXAMPLES:

      sage: triangle = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]])
      sage: triangle.base_ring() == ZZ
      True
```

I particularly like how the **example** directly contradicts the documentation ;-)  Anyway, all options should be tested.

I included "ZZ" in the doc.

Looks like that is all the options:

```
                raise TypeError('The base ring must be ZZ, QQ, or RDF')
```

Although this was supposed to be a very simple ticket, I wonder if I may as reviewer ask for two doctests testing the cdd reps get mad at bad base ring input...

We now have support for arbitrary rings, updated accordingly.

So if the ring isn't `ZZ,QQ,RDF` then the error code in the cdd h/v representations about that (see [comment:3 above]) is never reached, or is no longer correct?  Just checking.

The errors are only raised in the CDD format output which only supports these formats.

I added a doctest for the cdd format

This patch looks good to me. If the latest bot tests like it too I would set it to positive review.
