The latest release of sage at the time of writing is 9.2 but running:


```
docker run -it sagemath/sagemath:latest sage --version
```



gives:



```
SageMath version 9.1, Release Date: 2020-05-20
```

Our gitlab process was broken and nobody did care. Now trying to recover, see #30960

Is it possible to add a minimal github/gitlab workflow that checks that the docker creation works in princple, and which is fast enough to be run on each push to some branch? In this way one could make sure that tickets don't destroy the publishing pipeline.

the docker image for develop should now point to the very recent 9.3.beta3

but `sagemath/sagemath:latest` still is 9.1, while
`sagemath/sagemath:develop` indeed points to 9.3.beta3

This should be fixable eg manually, by pushing to docker, by the docker user `sagemathadmins` - whoever has access to it.

or just wait for 9.3, hoping that nothing else will break before the release
