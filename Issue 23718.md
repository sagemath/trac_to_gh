In sage.modules.genera.genus.canonical_2_adic_trains

Maybe this causes further bugs.

Most of my changes were superficial, but I did find what I thought was a typo.  You used to have

```
if left_neighbor == 1 or symbol[i] == 1 or right_neighbor==1:
```

which I changed to

```
if left_neighbor == 1 or symbol[i][3] == 1 or right_neighbor==1:
```

based on context.  If this is correct, you're happy with the rest of my changes, and tests pass, positive review.

Thank you for the changes. It is a lot cleaner now. 
Tests pass on my machine and the patchbot only complains about long tests in other unrelated components. Seems good.

No, that was a real problem in the tests with a TAB character.  I've fixed it now.
