# Issue 13266: univariate polynomial _xgcd only over fields

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-09-07 16:11:06

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: xgcd,

`sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element.Polynomial` provides an implementation for `_xgcd`. This implementation is not correct for polynomials over arbitrary rings. Therefore it should be moved to `sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_field`.

The way it currently is doesn't cause any bugs because only elements of PID call the `_xgcd` method. Nevertheless it should imho be moved.

Two minor things I'd like to see changed:
- The `INPUT:` bullet is indented one to many times
- Change the `OUTPUT:` to

```
Polynomials ``g``, ``u``, and ``v`` such that ``g = u * self + v * other``. 
```

Thanks.

Beta patch should replace original patch. Original patch fails due to intermediate changes in sage (as of 5.10). Beta patch also includes tscrim's suggested doc changes.

The patch is missing the header information. You'll need to run

```
sage -hg qrefresh -e
sage -hg export trac_13438_beta.patch > path/to/sage/devel/sage/.hg/patches/trac_13438_beta.patch
```

(or save it to wherever you'd like to upload the patch from). You should also add yourself as a reviewer of the patch with your real name.

Thanks,

Travis
