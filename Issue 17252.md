CC:  @kcrisman @nthiery

The `rings` version apparently gets overwritten on import. One should provide the much slower algorithms `gmp` and `pari` from that version.

It's a defect because the `reference/misc/sage/rings/arith.html` documentation makes users expect the `algorithm` keyword to work but

```
sage: y=factorial(10^6,algorithm='gmp')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'algorithm'
```

> Timing comparison
In fact, the `functions/other` version supposedly calling pynac/ginac actually indirectly calls the `rings/arith` version, i.e., gmp.

So, there will be no speed changes with this ticket.

This, however, means also that the problem with passing `algorithm` is due to `Function_factorial` being a `GinacFunction`. Of course, a `GinacFunction` would only use Ginac, so it figures.

        coercion_success = True
    except TypeError:
        coercion_success = False

Why not

```
    try:

    except TypeError:
        pass
    else:
        if x >= 0:
            return x.factorial()

    return py_tgamma(x+1)
```

The `algorithm` keyword can be given 1. as `__call__` keyword, or 2. as `n()` keyword. Do I understand you correctly that you don't want to have scenario 1?

EDIT: cannot be, as that would mean `n()` is always needed to get numerics. So `__call__` just hands it to `_evalf_or_eval_()`

I didn't say that. I just said that I don't want an `algorithm` keyword *only* for `factorial()`. I don't want a "solution" which needs to treat `factorial()` in a special way.

If you agree with this, please open a new ticket for supporting a more general `algorithm` keyword.
