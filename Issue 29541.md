The short answer here is simple: in `hypergeometric_motive.py` we have

```
       if q > 2 ** 31:
            return ValueError("p^f cannot exceed 2^31")
```

where `return` should be `raise`.

A more satisfying answer would be to relax the restriction on `q`, which was imposed to avoid integer overflows in the Cython code. I had thought this was beyond the range where these calculations would still be practical, but I appear to have been mistaken.

Since this code is getting a lot of use at this week's (virtual) ICERM workshop, Edgar Costa suggested some easy improvements that I bundled into a commit.

- Improve the error handling in `euler_factor` so that it does not factor the parameter value `t` (as this could be slow in some use cases).
- Add doctests for said error handling. (I also modified the doctest I added earlier on this ticket, so that it confirms not just the exception type but also the message.)
- Handle errors the same way in `padic_H_value` and `H_value`, again with doctests.
- Add `trace` as an alias for `padic_H_value`.
- Add `wild_primes` as a method to return the list of wild primes.
