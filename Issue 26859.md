# Issue 26859: Bug in Buchberger algorithm over Tate algebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27096

Tristan pointed out to me that my implementation of Buchberger algorithm in `sage.rings.tate_algebra_ideal` has a bug: I cannot discard S-polynomials of non-miminal series in Gr√∂bner bases under construction as I do.

Related ticket: #26195

Should be fixed.

As far as I understand, I should add a doctest demonstrating that the problem is fixed. The point is that I'm not sure I can easily produce an exemple on which the previous buggy implementation fails. Is it really needed?

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Do you have a test that shows this bug is fixed or was the doctest that you changed just wrong before (and so that would count as showing this is fixed)?

That's the point.

I don't a doctest showing that the bug is fixed and I think it won't be so easy to produce one. However, the algorithm which is implemented currently (that is before the fix) is not proved.

Okay. Then just add your name to the authors and you can set a positive review. Thanks.
