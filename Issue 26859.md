Tristan pointed out to me that my implementation of Buchberger algorithm in `sage.rings.tate_algebra_ideal` has a bug: I cannot discard S-polynomials of non-miminal series in Gr√∂bner bases under construction as I do.

Should be fixed.

As far as I understand, I should add a doctest demonstrating that the problem is fixed. The point is that I'm not sure I can easily produce an exemple on which the previous buggy implementation fails. Is it really needed?

Do you have a test that shows this bug is fixed or was the doctest that you changed just wrong before (and so that would count as showing this is fixed)?

That's the point.

I don't a doctest showing that the bug is fixed and I think it won't be so easy to produce one. However, the algorithm which is implemented currently (that is before the fix) is not proved.
