You seem to have accidentally pasted in:

```diff
     def matroid_polytope(self):
         r"""
-        Return the matroid polytope of ``self``.
+  src/sage/matroids/matroid.pyx      Return the matroid polytope of ``self``.
```

Also the long line I would like split is

```diff
             Matroid of rank 3 on 9 elements with circuit-closures
-            {2: {{'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'a', 'e', 'i'}, {'a', 'f', 'h'}, {'b', 'd', 'i'}, {'b', 'f', 'g'}, {'c', 'd', 'h'}, {'c', 'e', 'g'}, {'d', 'e', 'f'}, {'g', 'h', 'i'}}, 3: {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i'}}}
+            {2: {{'a', 'b', 'c'}, {'a', 'e', 'i'}, {'a', 'f', 'h'},
+                 {'b', 'd', 'i'}, {'b', 'f', 'g'}, {'c', 'd', 'h'},
+                 {'c', 'e', 'g'}, {'d', 'e', 'f'}, {'g', 'h', 'i'}},
+             3: {{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i'}}}
             sage: len(N.independent_sets())
```

Once these are changed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
