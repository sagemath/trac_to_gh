The intersection code is sometimes wrong. Here's an example:

This is the setup:

```
sage: d1 = J0(11).degeneracy_map(22, 1)
sage: d2 = J0(11).degeneracy_map(22, 2)
sage: A = (d1-d2).image()
sage: J = J0(22)
```


This is correct:

```
sage: J.intersection(A)
(Finite subgroup with invariants [] over QQbar of Abelian variety J0(22) of dimension 2,
 Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22))
```


This is wrong:

```
sage: A.intersection(J)
(Finite subgroup with invariants [2] over QQbar of Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22),
 Abelian subvariety of dimension 1 of J0(22))
```

No code change here. Just a documentation update.

The intersection of 2 abelian varieties, X and Y, is G+A, where G is a finite subgroup with an element in each component and A is the identity component. I don't think there's a canonical way to choose G so that it's a subgroup of X or Y.

A little tweak to get the punctuation correct:

```diff
-        canonical. (see :trac:`26189`). In this following example, ``B`` is a
-        subvariety of ``J``.::

Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
