I'm a bit confused that you use

```
+    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

before declaring it.

The other thing is that things have moved on already. Beta 12.3 is available and 12.2 is the default, once this ticket is merged (and no longer beta). So the description of this ticket should be updated accordingly.

Does it make sense to test 12.3 already?

Otherwise this looks fine.
