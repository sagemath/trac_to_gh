This doesn't work:


```
pts= [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1.5, 1],[2,1],[5,2],[6,3],[7,3]]
points(pts)
```


but this does


```
pts= [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1.5, 1],[2,1],[5,2],[6,3],[7,3]]
point(pts)
```

Aren't those the same statements?

one is plural, the other singular.

It seems to work now.  I probably redefined "points" somewhere when I originally ran into it.

Yeah, Mike, I thought it was weird because I thought one was an alias of the other.
