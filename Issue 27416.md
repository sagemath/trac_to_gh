This looks strange to me:

```diff
 --- a/sympy/core/function.py
 +++ b/sympy/core/function.py
-@@ -771,6 +771,16 @@ def _sage_(self):
-         func = sage.function(fname)(*args)
-         return func
+@@ -856,6 +856,16 @@ def _sage_(self):
+         return True
+ 
```

Care to explain what's happening here?

This is just a rebasing of the patch. The full patch is here https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/sympy/patches/03_undeffun_sage.patch?id=204b3bed466f13805d903ed4fc5dbb142089c6e8

I guess the old patch had one less blank line.
