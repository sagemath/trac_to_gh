In Sage 4.7.1:

```
sage: K = GF(4,'a')
sage: a = K.gens()[0]
sage: R.<x,y> = K[]
sage: p=x^8*y^3 + x^2*y^9 + a*x^9 + a*x*y^4
sage: q=y^11 + (a)*y^10 + (a + 1)*x*y^3
sage: p.factor(proof=False)
x * (x^7*y^3 + x*y^9 + (a)*x^8 + (a)*y^4)
sage: q.factor(proof=False)
y^3 * (y^8 + (a)*y^7 + (a + 1)*x)
sage: f = p*q
sage: f.factor(proof=False)
```

The last command seems to hang forever.

Changing keywords from "" to "sd34".

I can confirm this in sage 4.7.1. But it don't happen in sage 4.7.2 anymore.
I immediately get

```
x * y^3 * (y^8 + (a)*y^7 + (a + 1)*x) * (x^7*y^3 + x*y^9 + (a)*x^8 + (a)*y^4)
```

I confirm it works with sage 4.7.2. I will add a non-regression test during the SageFlint days.
