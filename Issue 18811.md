I've reviewed your changes, merged the latest `asy/asymptoticExpression` into this branch and applied a tiny reviewer's patch (somehow, `'exact` was pasted where it definitely should not). In principal, everything looks good to me and the doctests pass.

However, do you think that `asymptotic_term.py` really is the best place for the `product_diagonal` function? I do understand that it is required as a helper function there -- but nevertheless, from my point of view, the function is sufficiently general so that it could also live, for example, in `src/sage/misc/misc.py`.

What do you think?

Perhaps the name `product_diagonal` could be changed to refer to the [Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function)?

There is a module on [multidimensional enumeration](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/misc/sage/misc/mrange.html), but apparently, it only deals with finite iterators.

I reviewed this code before #19319 had been factored out and did not have any objections to the part which is still in this ticket.

Replying to [comment:24 cheuberg]:
> #19319 now has completely new code which is guaranteed to produce merge conflicts here.

I now reverted all changes by the old branch of #19319, merged the new branch of #19319 and fixed code and doctests here.

Please cross-review this revert+merge+fix and set the ticket to `positive_review` if you are satisfied.
