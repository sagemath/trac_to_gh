Why yes it does. I copied the updated version that says "iterator" from `src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py` and force-pushed an update.

Why not just use `zip(self._sets_keys(), elements)`?

> Why not just do`return self.sum(self.summand_embedding(i)(elt) for i,elt in enumerate(elements))`?

The answer to that question is "because I didn't think of it."

Replying to [comment:7 mkoeppe]:
> Why not just use `zip(self._sets_keys(), elements)`?

Using `_sets_keys` is CFM actually "wrong" and introduces a miniscule performance penalty in any method that (possibly indirectly) references `cartesian_factors()`. The CFM subclass method is,


```python
def cartesian_factors(self):
    return self._sets
```


which puts the factors in "left to right" order, regardless of what order `_sets_keys()` is in. Compare with the superclass method,


```python
def cartesian_factors(self):
    return tuple(self.cartesian_projection(i)
                 for i in self.parent()._sets_keys())
```


which... is at least... trying? to do the right thing?

In any case, using `count(0)` avoids giving the impression that the `sets_keys()` order is actually used for `elements`. I think either `_sets_keys()` should be used everywhere, for consistency, or nowhere, for performance.

In any case, for now I'd just like it to work =)

I've used your code.
