CC:  @embray @kiwifb @isuruf

Arguments in AC_LINK_IFELSE there were totally mixed up.
(Found by analogy of a similar error made on #28333, and caught
by the reviewer.)
It only worked by a "miracle".

here is a fix.

I see, good catch. I'm not sure by what miracle this even worked at all.

I'll test when I get back to a computer, but I think this is probably right.

the test lacked proper LIBS and returned false, but the remaining args were shifted by one, so it hit the "true" outcome. And LIBS were adjusted somehow, too...

Was it definitely adjusting `LIBS` before, or just `LDFLAGS`?  Oh well, in any case, this is clearly better.  I only want to test to see for myself.

I wonder if we should really be modifying `$LIBS` at all.  Each time we do an `AC_CHECK_LIB` or similar, that passes, that lib is getting added to `$LIBS`, and thus every subsequent library check is over-linking (with all the `-l` flags added via previous `AC_CHECK_LIB` calls).

It hasn't been a problem yet that I know of, and it might even be useful.  Just thought I would mention it.
