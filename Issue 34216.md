sage: X = algebras.Shuffle(QQ, 'ab')
sage: Y = algebras.Shuffle(QQ, 'bc')
sage: X in CommutativeRings()
True

True
sage: T = tensor([X,Y])
sage: T in CommutativeRings()
False

would this work too for the tensor product of a shuffle algebra A and a polynomial ring B ? maybe add this kind of simple example ?

I tried `A.tensor(B)` on vanilla sage and it failed.

Sadly, a polynomial ring does not (yet) know it is an algebra over its base ring.

the patchbot reports a strange doctest failure, most probably unrelated

if you agree with this diagnostic, you can set to positive

I saw that on another ticket, so it is definitely unrelated.

Thank you.

Replying to [comment:4 Travis Scrimshaw]:
> Sadly, a polynomial ring does not (yet) know it is an algebra over its base ring.

Could you give an example for this?

```
sage: P.<x,y> = Integers(8)[]
sage: P in Algebras(P.base_ring())
True
```

I must be misremembering then.
