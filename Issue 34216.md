would this work too for the tensor product of a shuffle algebra A and a polynomial ring B ? maybe add this kind of simple example ?

I tried `A.tensor(B)` on vanilla sage and it failed.

> Sadly, a polynomial ring does not (yet) know it is an algebra over its base ring.

Could you give an example for this?

```
sage: P.<x,y> = Integers(8)[]
sage: P in Algebras(P.base_ring())
True
```
