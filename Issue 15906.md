As an example on how to use cartesian products of transducers as introduced in #16061, a transducer converting standard binary expansion into Gray code is constructed by emulating the standard algorithm by xoring the the standard binary expansion with its shifted version.

The class collecting common transducers introduced in #16141 now also has a (hard-coded) version of the same transducer and it is made sure that both transducers agree.

During the review I realized that the Gray-code transducer (in generators) didn't have any final states. I've corrected this. I added a doctest to print the Gray code of the first 10 non-negative integers.
Please review my changes.

Modified example in `finite_state_machine.py` to also have correct final states and compare it with the final states given by `transducers.GrayCode`. 

Corrected link from `transducers.GrayCode` to this example.

Cross-reviewed all changes by dkrenn, they are fine for me.

Corrected left-shift transducer (it is a right-shift transducer, as highlighted by the above doctest) and explained this.

Reviewed your changes...ok.

Rewrote/Extended the documentation of the 'shift'-part of the example. Please review.

I rewrote the documentation to clarify the position of the least significant digit and the direction of the shift. Please review.

Everthing else is fine for me.

Fome also for me. Since all participants in this ticket agree, I give it a positive review.
