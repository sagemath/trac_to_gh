There appear to be some bugs in _echelon_form_multimodular: 


```
sage: W.<z> = CyclotomicField(13)
sage: A = matrix(W, 2, 3, [10^30*(1-z)^13, 1, 2, 3, 4, z])
sage: A._echelon_classical() == A._echelon_form_multimodular()
False
```


And are there really too few primes to do this one? 

```
sage: A = matrix(W, 2, 3, [(1-z)^13, 1, 2, 3, 4, z])
sage: A._echelon_classical() == A._echelon_form_multimodular()

The code looks good, is well documented, and fast. Aside from the errors in _echelon_form_multimodular it seems to work as advertised. 

I added a patch illustrating what _reduction_matrix actually does, as this seems central to the ideas behind the algorithms. There needs to be at least a paragraph or two at the top explaining the storage format and ideas behind the algorithm (maybe the example I posted belongs there)--if I hadn't had it explained to me it would have probably taken a while to get the "big picture" from the code. 

Once these issues are all solved, I think it's ready.

I'm adding a patch that should address all of the above issues. There were two bugs in multimodular echelon form, which are now both gone. I've added a few new doctests, as well as a (fairly brief) paragraph with a description of the underlying data structure. I think that this code should be ready to merge.

A note on 


```
    RuntimeError: we ran out of primes in multimodular charpoly algorithm.
```


This sounds a lot like the original bad case I found, which now works but is much slower than the classical echelon. Perhaps there should be a better heuristic falling back to classical? (Or, hopefully, there's still a bug in picking the bound).

Hi Robert,

my guess would be that the bound then gets miscomputed on a 64 bit box. IIRC all you three authors of the patch set did code and test this patch set in 32 bit mode on OSX. 

Thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael

If no one else wants to deal with this, I'll look at it next Weds when I get to Seattle. I'm happy to take care of it then.
