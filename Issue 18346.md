We should really clean up the declarations in `sage/libs/paridecl.pxd`, analogous to what has been done for `gmp` for example.

Could you just add a comment on why `types.pxd` should not call any PARI function?

I guess it is to avoid the need to link to PARI when cimporting taht file, but that's not stated.
