# Issue 19561: fix zeta on the universal cyclotomic field

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19798

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2015-12-29 17:51:48

All roots of unity belong to the cyclotomic field but currently

```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField().zeta(6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: 
```


We simply add an alias `zeta -> gen`.
