Green bot, ready for review (the `deprecation_number` plugin failure is complaining about code from the #32610 ticket)

There is no deprecation for `is_RealIntervalField()` AFAICS. Otherwise LGTM.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-10-04 23:36:12

The whole module `sage.rings.real_interval_field`, which provides `is_RealIntervalField`, is already deprecated
