Do you have any plans for this ticket? Is it finished, needs work, abandoned? 

Having a `WeierstrassCubic` class hierarchy sounds like a good idea but it needs to be integrated.

Also, right now its one huge patch bomb. It would be nice if it could be split into manageable pieces, for example start with `WeierstrassCubic_generic` only and then build on top of that.

Who is "you"?

That's a necessary condition, certainly.

I myself don't need this.  I'm also worried that since elliptic curves would be a special case, this would add a new layer of code for all elliptic curves, slowing them down, which would be a Bad Thing.

Anyway, it's up to the people who worked on this in the frst place to make their case!
