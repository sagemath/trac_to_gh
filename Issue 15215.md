Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: defeo

Original creation time: 2013-11-25 20:54:31

As noted in <http://ask.sagemath.org/question/3254/undefined-control-sequence-when-showing>


```
sage: Z5=Integers(5)
sage: show(Z5.multiplication_table())
```


Makes pdfTeX go nuts. This is due to a rogue backslash.

Right. That's why trac was showing no difference from master! Let's close this.
