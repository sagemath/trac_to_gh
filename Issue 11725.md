1.  Patch marks failing doctests as "not tested"

Rationale:  this was just meant to show how to get results for inexact matrices with real or complex entries.  It is in the middle of a docstring for an exact routine.  So this preserves the "doc" part and abandons the "test" part.

2.  Patch repeats, and fixes, doctest in the TEST section of the eigenmatrix routines.

Rational: doctest has not been abandoned.  Due to the need to adjust the sign of the eigenvectors, this is relegated to a test section.


This was built on an alpha3 prerelease, I trust it will be OK on a real alpha3 (which I am about to build right now).

No, did not want to venture into polynomials - just took responsibility for matrices.

Forgot to actually start a build last night, so it will be maybe 12 hours at the soonest before I can build a proper patch (long story).  But will do.

Sorry, I could easily have done that yesterday, but I was too tired to even look at the rejects.

The rebased patch also passes tests and the documentation builds fine, so **positive review** from my side.

You don't even want to know how old this computer is, nor how many hands it's passed through on the way to me.  But luckily the password is still rms' favorite - carriage return - and its only use is for testing Sage, so that's all I need!  I know it's a burden sometimes, but I think that it's picked up a number of (real) bugs over the last couple years as well, vindicating Dave Kirkby's philosophy of "test as widely as possible".

Anyway, I'll get that fired up tomorrow morning when I get in.

Hmmm, would be nicer to expect a true zero (`0`) there and once again use `.zero_at(2e-15)` (or `2e-16` in one case)...

If you use `# tol`, that applies to *all entries* in the same way, i.e. with the same relative or absolute tolerance, which IMHO wouldn't be appropriate here.
