> Do we lose something by removing the `exec` part ?


The way i wrote it, i would say no. The trick with `exec` is that the current process is replaced, hence after the command is finished, the further lines of the current script are not executed. This explains why, when removing the `exec` i had to catch the error (to send the appropriate message) and then be sure to exit.

The only drawback i see, is that the construction is different from the other cases in the script (that still use exec).
