Instead of reversing `verts`, wouldn't it be easier to use the negative distance? Granted, this adds some complexity to the code, but it would be faster. I don't really hold a strong opinion either way, and whatever you decide, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I tried everything, and this was the only way to have no failing doctest.

I am setting to positive review, thanks Travis.
