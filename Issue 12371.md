Currently, import_statements yields a name error if the class is not yet imported. For example 


```
   sage: import_statements(ClonableIntArray)
   NameError: name 'ClonableIntArray' is not defined
```


It would be desirable to have import_statements run a search_def in case the object is not imported by default in the interpreter. This would require passing the name of the object as:


```
    sage: import_statements("ClonableIntArray")
```


It also would probably require extending search_def to also look up
classes and not only functions.
