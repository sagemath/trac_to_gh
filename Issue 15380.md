Changing keywords from "" to "spkg ncurses".

The code about no-cpp-precomp flag was modified and after a very quick look our patch should not be needed anymore on OS X.
I did not check it was the case yet, but I'll quickly give it a shot on bsd.

FYI, it built correctly on bsd
So no reason to hold on.

It works for me on cygwin (both 32 and 64). Since it built okay on BSD, I'm giving this a positive review.

This fails on mark/skynet: http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20slow%20Skynet%20mark%20%28SunOS%205.10-32%29%20full/builds/17/steps/compile_1/logs/ncurses. Please open another ticket to fix or I'll have to back this branch out again.

I think I got it: once again XOPEN_SOURCE stuff is passed to g++ through CPPFLAGS.
Not sure if the bug is upstream or from autotools.
