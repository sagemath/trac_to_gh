The computation of the fundamental group of algebraic plane curves is done by computing the braid monodromy (which already takes advantage of parallelization), and then computing the action of the braids over the free group.

This second step can take non negligible time in some cases. With this simple change, it is computed in parallel too, which can save some time.
