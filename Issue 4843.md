There are some small issues with Sage's readline and the one from OpenSUSE not playing well together. I have some temporary fix to get around this.

Cheers,

Michael

The spkg at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/spkgs/readline-5.2.p5.spkg

fixes the issue. It also cleans up SPKG.txt and brings it up to code.

Cheers,

Michael
