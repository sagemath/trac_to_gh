Good idea.

- I think that this needs seealso-crosslinks with `sublattices_lattice()`.
- Should return type be lattice when `self` is of type lattice? Compare for example to `dual()`.
- We really should have a guideline whether to use `self` or "the thing" at docstrings. This now conflicts with other functions at `posets.py`.

Tests passed, nothing wrong with the code etc. The function does what it says to do, so I could put this to positive review. And the code is fast -- good work!

But where is this "natural partial order" defined? I would have guessed from the name that it means a poset where `[a,b] <= [c,d]` iff `a >= c` and `b <= d`. Then for lattices it would be lattice of convex sublattices, hence a sublattice of lattice of (all) sublattices. That's why I suggested seealso-crosslinks; sorry for not reading this carefully.

}
```

This is natural in the following sense:

a poset is a category, a morphism of posets is a functor, a morphism between morphisms of posets is a natural transformation.

So if posets are understood in the proper language, there is no real choice for
a natural definition of a partial order on the morphisms from 2 to P.

Should I remove the cross-links ?
