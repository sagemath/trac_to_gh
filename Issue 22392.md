On #22623, I was writing a number of methods that were generic for (finite dimensional) modules with basis that should be put into the category. These include:

- `_from_dict`
- `dimension`
- `_dense_free_module`
- `_vector_`

Fixed. One error was due to a typo. The errors in the Schur algebras were exposing that they and their tensor modules were not placed in the correct category. I also reverted a change to `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement._vector_` to avoid conflicts with #22632.

Patchbot is green. Should be a relatively simple review.

Patchbot is (essentially) green and this does not conflict with #22632.

is the vector.iteritems python3-safe ?

**EDIT** It seems so, indeed, as a method of vectors.
