Is this solved by #31502?

No, the user-facing docker image building scripts have nothing to do with GH Actions.

`@`saraedum : can we close that one ?

By the way, our docker process needs care..

Can we move building Sage's docker image(s) to [GitHub](GitHub) Actions?

Yes, I think there's no technical obstacle to that. The 6 hour time limit should be plenty - it is enough for most of our CI tests that also build from scratch. 
You could consider to follow #29536
