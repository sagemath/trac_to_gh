# Issue 32508: slackware-14.2-standard: conway_polynomials, elliptic_curves: Installation fails

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32745

```
  [conway_polynomials-0.5]   ./spkg-install: line 37: exec: python3: not found
```


Likely a regression caused by #32442 (`./configure: Make --with-sage-venv=auto the default`)

It seems the `SAGE_VENV/bin` (where `python3` is installed) is not in the PATH at the time that these package install scripts are run.

This fixes the problem, as can be verified using `tox -e docker-slackware-14.2-minimal -- conway_polynomials`
