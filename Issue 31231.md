I'm not sure how fully evaluate this ticket. I can use it on macOS 10.15.7, but the [GitHub](GitHub) reports errors for some docker images.

Without this, if I unpack a tarball and do `./configure --enable-texttable && make texttable`, it claims to succeed but doesn't install anything anywhere except for a `whl` file. With this, it also installs `pip`, `setuptools`, etc., and more importantly it installs files for `texttable` in `local/lib/python3.9/site-packages`.
