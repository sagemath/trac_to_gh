It's not working currently, but I'm hoping you can help.  The current complaint I'm getting is


```
'sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra_element.UntwistedAffineLieAlgebraElement' object has no attribute '_d_coeff'
```


This comes, for example, when trying to compute 


```
sage: g = LieAlgebra(QQ, cartan_type=['A',1,1])
sage: list(g.lie_algebra_generators())
```


I went to the `.pyx` file and confirmed that the attribute `_d_coeff` is there, so I'm not sure what's going wrong.

Hi Travis,

I made a bunch of changes.  If you are okay with them, then you may set this to positive review.  All documentation builds and tests passed on my machine.
