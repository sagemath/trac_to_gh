# Issue 27048: Problem testing a ring instance

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27285

Original creator: @AdrienPoteaux

Original creation time: 2019-02-14 23:41:10

CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: PolynomialRing

I am writing some code to compute Puiseux series of F in `K[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)[y]`

To that purpose, I created a class and I am trying this class to be loaded when calling PolynomialRing with a PowerSeriesRing as a parameter.

The problem is that Sage loads PolynomialRing at start, and that at this point, PowerSeriesRing have not been loaded yet... thus sage crashes.

Currently in Luminy in the opendreamkit event, Jeroen told me to push my code and create this ticket.

This solves your immediate problem:

```
@@ -720,10 +720,11 @@ def _single_variate(base_ring, name, sparse=None, implementation=None, order=Non
             constructor = specialized
 
     # Generic implementations
+    import sage.rings.power_series_ring
     if constructor is None:
         if not isinstance(base_ring, ring.CommutativeRing):
             constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_general
-        elif isinstance(base_ring,ring.power_series_ring.PowerSeriesRing_over_field):
+        elif isinstance(base_ring,sage.rings.power_series_ring.PowerSeriesRing_over_field):
             constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_powerseries_cdvr
         elif base_ring in _CompleteDiscreteValuationRings:
             constructor = polynomial_ring.PolynomialRing_cdvr
```

(This may or may not be the right way of plugging your new class in the framework of polynomial rings, though.)

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
