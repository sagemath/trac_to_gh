CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: PolynomialRing

I am writing some code to compute Puiseux series of F in `K[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)[y]`

To that purpose, I created a class and I am trying this class to be loaded when calling PolynomialRing with a PowerSeriesRing as a parameter.

The problem is that Sage loads PolynomialRing at start, and that at this point, PowerSeriesRing have not been loaded yet... thus sage crashes.

Currently in Luminy in the opendreamkit event, Jeroen told me to push my code and create this ticket.
