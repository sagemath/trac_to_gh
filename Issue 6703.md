A well known issue and one I think may be fixable without a huge effort. The Sun compilers give better performance on Solaris than GNU.

Note, Sun Studio which contains the latest Solaris compilers is now free from Sun - it used to cost a lot of money.

Closing very old sun/solaris tickets. Any tentative for this OS should start afresh.
