I just referred somebody to the command algebraic_dependency, and was surprised to see it has mysteriously vanished from Sage?!


```
/scratch/wstein/sage-6.4.rc1$ ./sage
│ Sage Version 6.4.rc1, Release Date: 2014-11-01                     │
sage: algebraic_dependency
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
```


There is now an algdep command, which is an abbreviation for algebraic_dependency, and its docstring even says that it is a synonym for algebraic_dependency:


```
sage: algdep?
...
  Note that "algebraic_dependency" is a synonym for "algdep".
...
```

also this should be fixed (see #9031), since PARI is not used in all cases:

```
   You can specify the number of known bits or digits of z with
   "known_bits=k" or "known_digits=k". PARI is then told to compute
   the result using 0.8k of these bits/digits.
```
