# Issue 34112: SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34349

Original creator: @heindel

Original creation time: 2022-08-12 09:02:56

The following issue kept coming (after double checking that I had the packages installed as described)

```
checking that generated files are newer than configure... done
configure: creating ./config.status
configure:

    notice: the following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:

        fflas_ffpack fplll givaro linbox lrcalc primecount qhull   4ti2 coxeter3 libsemigroups polymake _recommended
        
checking for the package system in use... debian
configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, is recommended and may avoid having to
    build them (though some may have to be built anyway):

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  fflas-ffpack libfplll-dev libgivaro-dev liblinbox-dev liblrcalc-dev libqhull-dev

configure:

    hint: installing the following system packages, if not
    already present, may provide additional optional features:

      $ sudo apt-get update 
      $ sudo apt-get install  4ti2 polymake libpolymake-dev default-jdk libavdevice-dev
```

Thanks for the report!

Our suggestion mechanism is not perfect.

The phrasing ("if not already present", "may")
tries to convey that.

Propose to close as wontfix, unless someone
can suggest a concrete improvement.

output.txt contains all the answers. For example:

```
Checking whether SageMath should install SPKG givaro...
326	checking whether any of gmp is installed as or will be installed as SPKG... no
327	checking for givaro-config... /usr/bin/givaro-config
328	checking is givaro's version acceptable? ... no, too new
329	configure: no suitable system package found for SPKG givaro
```
