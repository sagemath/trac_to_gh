Currently factorization code ignores the proof flag for polynomials:


```
sage: k.<u> = GF(4)
sage: R.<v> = k[]
sage: l.<v> = R.quo(v^3 + v + 1)
sage: R.<x,y> = l[]
sage: f = y^3 + x^3 + (u + 1)*x
sage: with proof.WithProof('polynomial', True):
....:     f.factor()
NotImplementedError: "proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False."
sage: with proof.WithProof('polynomial', False):
....:     f.factor()
NotImplementedError: "proof = True factorization not implemented.  Call factor with proof=False."
```

I have a doubt about your new error message: Why do you insist on wrapping the computation in a "withproof" block rather than using the keyword `proof=True`? I agree that it may be more pythonic, though I guess it is simpler for users to use the keyword.
