This was due to http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12213, and not fixed by #12222, because that only focused on shape primitives.  
```


The fix is most likely to add an option in the decorators of all the contour_plot.py commands to put aspect ratio back to 1 for those things.

Critical because we have in the past long discussed this; I would like to make it blocker since 

```
This should plot concentric circles centered at the origin::

        sage: x,y = var('x,y')
        sage: contour_plot(x^2+y^2-2,(x,-1,1), (y,-1,1))
```

doesn't look like circles, but I suppose that they *are* circles...

This *might* depend on #9744.  I don't think it touches the same parts of contour_plot.py, but if you get a problem applying, then it does.  Note that we don't need the option for `implicit_plot` because it always gives a region plot or a contour plot.

For reviewing; please test whether this breaks anything from #11963.  I don't quite understand what the 'correct' summation behavior is yet.  I assume that this works okay, though.

And a question; should it be `1.0` instead of `1`?

It looks like your patch applies over #9744 with a bit of fuzz, but it doesn't apply to a clean 5.0.beta5, so I changed the dependencies. I looked through the live docs for contour_plot with the patch applied and things look much better now. I don't see any problems. I haven't looked at whether anything from #11963 breaks yet..

FWIW, there are 6 places in the Sage library .py files where `aspect_ratio=1.0` is used, and 46 places where `aspect_ratio=1` is used (thank you, ack).
