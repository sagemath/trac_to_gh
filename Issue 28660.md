# Issue 28660: BipartiteGraph blindly trusts generic graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28897

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-12-18 20:48:36

Keywords: bipartite graph, add edges

Currently, `BipartiteGraph` blindly trusts the generic graph to not change the way `add_edges` is implemented. In particular, it relies on it to just iterate over the edges and then call the method `add_edge` for each edge.

We add a doctest, to ensure this is not being missed if `add_edges` is optimized.

Actually, the added doctest shows that we need a specific method for `add_edges`. The one of generic graph calls a backend that is not specific to bipartite graphs.

At the moment everything works fine. `add_edges` calls `add_edge`, which checks that the vertices lie in different partitions.

However, once one modifies `add_edges` to directly call the backend, `BipartiteGraph` needs a modified version of it. If we add a special version now, we still have to remember it, once we optimize `add_edges` in generic graph.

The doctest would just ensure that one doesn't miss it with little effort for now.

No.  In 9.0.beta9, `add_edges` calls `self._backend.add_edge(u, v, label, self._directed)`, and so the added doctest fails. 
The patchbots are reporting that failing doctest.

Ok. Never mind. I must have misread and not tested it (even though I thought I did).

You must change the documentation for parameter `loops` as loops should not be allowed in a bipartite graph. I suggest to set it to `False` by default, and document that it is always considered as `False`. This is exactly what current implementation do. For instance, with this patch, we get

```
sage: G = BipartiteGraph([(0,0)], loops=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-273b7e5c1458> in <module>()
----> 1 G = BipartiteGraph([(Integer(0),Integer(0))], loops=True)

/Users/dcoudert/sage3/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/bipartite_graph.py in __init__(self, data, partition, check, *args, **kwds)
    309         else:
    310             if 'loops' in kwds and kwds['loops']:
--> 311                 raise ValueError('loops are not allowed in bipartite graphs')
    312             kwds['loops'] = False
    313 

ValueError: loops are not allowed in bipartite graphs
```


I just realized that some input parameters of `BipartiteGraph` are not documented, like `weighted`, `multiedges`, and of course `loops`.


Instead of defining a function `check_edge` and call `self._backend.add_edges(map...)`, it might be faster to make a loop `for e in edges` in which you check the validity of that edge and if the edge is ok, then call `self._backend.add_edge(u, v, label, self._directed)`. Indeed, method `self._backend.add_edges` also has to check if an edge is a pair or a triple.

Ok.

As for ignoring loops, I wouldn't allow it. In a generic graph, I can see that one wants the method to remove loops for comfort.

In a bipartite graph, one needs to clean up the input anyway. Loops is just one of many cases, where the ends of an edge are not in different parts.


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-12-22 11:55:06

Please set the default value of loops to `False`.

Once done, you can set to positive review on my behalf.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2019-12-22 12:16:27

I don't understand. Doesn't `False` mean that we just skip loops without error?


---

Comment by dcoudert created at 2019-12-22 12:25:15

No, in Graph we raise an error when loops is `False` or `None`. The behavior has been changed some months ago after years of deprecation warnings.

sage: G = Graph(loops=False)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0)

Yes. But when you do


```
sage: G.add_edges([[0, 0]], loops=False)
```


it just ignores all the loops and does not raise an error (as is documented in `add_edges`).
