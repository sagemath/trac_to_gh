Keywords: bipartite graph, add edges

Currently, `BipartiteGraph` blindly trusts the generic graph to not change the way `add_edges` is implemented. In particular, it relies on it to just iterate over the edges and then call the method `add_edge` for each edge.

We add a doctest, to ensure this is not being missed if `add_edges` is optimized.

At the moment everything works fine. `add_edges` calls `add_edge`, which checks that the vertices lie in different partitions.

However, once one modifies `add_edges` to directly call the backend, `BipartiteGraph` needs a modified version of it. If we add a special version now, we still have to remember it, once we optimize `add_edges` in generic graph.

The doctest would just ensure that one doesn't miss it with little effort for now.

You must change the documentation for parameter `loops` as loops should not be allowed in a bipartite graph. I suggest to set it to `False` by default, and document that it is always considered as `False`. This is exactly what current implementation do. For instance, with this patch, we get

```

    312             kwds['loops'] = False
    313 

ValueError: loops are not allowed in bipartite graphs
```


I just realized that some input parameters of `BipartiteGraph` are not documented, like `weighted`, `multiedges`, and of course `loops`.


Instead of defining a function `check_edge` and call `self._backend.add_edges(map...)`, it might be faster to make a loop `for e in edges` in which you check the validity of that edge and if the edge is ok, then call `self._backend.add_edge(u, v, label, self._directed)`. Indeed, method `self._backend.add_edges` also has to check if an edge is a pair or a triple.

Ok.

As for ignoring loops, I wouldn't allow it. In a generic graph, I can see that one wants the method to remove loops for comfort.

In a bipartite graph, one needs to clean up the input anyway. Loops is just one of many cases, where the ends of an edge are not in different parts.

Yes. But when you do


```

it just ignores all the loops and does not raise an error (as is documented in `add_edges`).
