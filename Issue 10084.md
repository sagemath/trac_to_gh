If I type the following:

```
S1 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(ZZ)
S2 = LazyPowerSeriesRing(S1)
y = S2.gen()
y.coefficient(1) == 1
```

I get True, and

```
y.coefficient(1).coefficient(0)
```

gets me the "'int' object has no attribute 'coefficient'" error message.

I solved the problem by changing the following line in the gen() method:

```
res = self._new_initial(1, Stream([0,1,0]))
```

by

```
res = self.term(1, 1)}}}

	The coefficient of order 1 in the series y should not be the integer 1, but the power series [1, 0, ...] in S1.
