# Issue 13990: Conversion from pari to sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14194

Conversion from pari to Sage uses the global namespace:


```
sage: QQ['s'].gen()._pari_().sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 's' is not defined
sage: GF(9, 'a').gen()._pari_().sage()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

We can do better.

What's the problem? I don't really see how you want to fix this.

I'm sure roed knows this, but the correct call syntax here is:

```
sage: sage: R = QQ['s']
sage: sage: t = R.gen()._pari_()
sage: sage: R(t)
s
sage: F = GF(9, 'a')
sage: t = F.gen()._pari_()
sage: F(t)
a
```

After all, PARI has no class hierarchy, so why should a PARI univariate polynomial be expected to know which Sage polynomial ring it should convert back to?

If I were feeling provocative, I might go further and propose that the sage method of a PARI object should be deprecated in favor of the constructor syntax shown above, even for PARI types where there isn't any ambiguity about the Sage parent (e.g., integers).
