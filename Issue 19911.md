# Issue 19911: make -j has nothing to do with threads

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20148

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2016-03-02 16:19:14

Keywords: docs installation

Just a slight clarification to the installation from source instructions.

For documentation updates how do we propagate them to the translations?  This is a change only to the English docs.

So does positive_review mean I should go ahead and merge? What's the workflow here...? :)

The release manager (Volker Braun) will do what needs to be done.
