Issue created by migration from Trac.

This may potentially help with issues compiling sqlite with xcode 7 on older versions of OS X.

The `autoconf` in the package version looks a bit silly. Couldn't we put the string `autoconf-` in the tarball name in `checksums.ini` instead of in `package-version.txt`.

And remember to set this to needs_review if you are done.

I guess whoever started that, just followed the scheme of sqlite (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) but yes it is silly, so I'll adopt your suggestion.

Ok putting this to review whether or not it helps with xcode 7. It shouldn't be controversial.
