The `autoconf` in the package version looks a bit silly. Couldn't we put the string `autoconf-` in the tarball name in `checksums.ini` instead of in `package-version.txt`.

And remember to set this to needs_review if you are done.

I guess whoever started that, just followed the scheme of sqlite (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) but yes it is silly, so I'll adopt your suggestion.
