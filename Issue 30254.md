Currently, the LatticePoset constructor always check if the poset is indeed a lattice. This should not be required if this is a known property, already proved.

The parameter `check=False` will allow to avoid computing the join matrix at init, because this a very time-consuming property.

By default, the join matrix will be computed, unless `check=False`.
