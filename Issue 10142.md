There are a few functions missing doctesting in sage/plot that aren't in plot3d/.  Fixing this is the subject of this ticket.  Doing it for plot.py largely is about GraphicsArray objects, so that is a separate ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10143

Okay, this adds the plot doc stuff, and also adds the `z=0` option for a couple of `.plot3d()` methods.   Needs review, should be fairly straightforward.

Humble pie - BOTH the first two were typos.  Sorry.  The new description is correct.
