# Issue 10142: Bring 2D plotting up to 100% doctest coverage (except plot.py)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10143

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2010-10-18 21:12:20

There are a few functions missing doctesting in sage/plot that aren't in plot3d/.  Fixing this is the subject of this ticket.  Doing it for plot.py largely is about GraphicsArray objects, so that is a separate ticket.

Patch coming up soon (just checking that build docs still look correct).

Okay, this adds the plot doc stuff, and also adds the `z=0` option for a couple of `.plot3d()` methods.   Needs review, should be fairly straightforward.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

kcrisman's patch is fine by me. However, I noticed some misformatting and a broken link to the function `show()`. These are fixed in my reviewer patch. Someone needs to look over that one. I noticed that the function `ensure_subs()` is removed by kcrisman's patch. This is OK because that function is not used anywhere in the Sage library. Grepping through the whole Sage library only shows that `ensure_subs()` is defined and imported, but never used. See the ticket description for instructions on which tickets to apply.

Thanks for fixing those - that's why we have reviews!  

I thought I explained elsewhere on the ticket why I removed that function, but maybe I didn't?  I came to the same conclusion you did; it was used in previous plot behavior, but no longer.

I gave kcrisman's patch a positive review. Someone just needs to review my patch for this ticket to be closed as fixed.

Minh's reviewer's patch looks good.

This needs to be rebased to apply on top of #9907.

Nuts!  I'll try to get to this today.  Hopefully it won't conflict with some of the other things going on in plotting...

Okay, now need to be rebased also for #9781, #8236, and #10244.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2011-01-14 03:38:07

Based on 4.6.1

The only rebase needed was in removing the `ensure_subs` function in misc.py.  The reviewer patch still applies after this.   There are no other changes, and I once again checked docs and tests, so I think positive review restoration is appropriate.

To buildbot: depends on #9781, #8236, and #10244 - apply trac_10143-2dplotcoverage.patch and trac-10143_reviewer.patch

Just FYI - still applies fine on 4.6.2.alpha0.

The first of the current dependencies is closed, the second, I believe, is a mistake and should have been #8632, which is a prerequisite for #10244. So it seems that I can just say

Depends on #10244

Well, specifiying *all* dependencies is much more useful actually.

I completely agree, but it seems to confuse the buildbot which tried to apply patches twice.

Humble pie - BOTH the first two were typos.  Sorry.  The new description is correct.

> Depends on #10244

I see what is going on.  Useful for buildbot, but not at all useful for people manually applying patches who won't know how many iterations they have to go back!  Thanks for the clarification.
