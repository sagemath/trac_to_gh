I noticed that some of the code blocks are not typeset in colour, any idea why?

Per [William](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/676b12077744d352/49bafe1eac2c7d88#49bafe1eac2c7d88), should we replace "come in pairs" with "be called in pairs"?

I think Sphinx (or Pygments) expects a statement in an except clause.  According to [Showing code examples](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/code.html), "Normal Python code is only highlighted if it is parseable."

Technically, they aren't function so you can't really "call" them.  But I read that post and maybe some clarification is needed.

Thanks, that's it.  Unfortunately, I cannot make Cython code parseable as Python :-(

No point in reviewing it now, given #9678 will change many things.

I see no harm in actually putting this in the docs, as it's important to know the old bevaiour in order to change code
to use the new design!
