Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: sig_on developer

I added a section about `sig_on()` in the developer manual.

I split off the part about Cython from `coding_in_other.rst` and put this in a new file `coding_in_cython.rst`.

I also expanded the part about PARI a bit.

New developers manual: [http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doc/developer/index.html](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jdemeyer/doc/developer/index.html)

I think Sphinx (or Pygments) expects a statement in an except clause.  According to [Showing code examples](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/code.html), "Normal Python code is only highlighted if it is parseable."
