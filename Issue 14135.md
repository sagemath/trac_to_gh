# Issue 14135: More doctests from the book "Calcul mathématique avec Sage"

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2013-03-22 20:55:29

Assignee: tbd

The attached file provides doctests for examples in the chapter on solving nonlinear equations, which I am posting on behalf of Matthias Meulien. See #9395 for some background.

(Matthias, I took the liberty of marking two of the tests with `# long time`.)

All tests pass with Sage 5.9β0 on my machine.

for 1) it would be better to change it globally, the current doctest framework still accepting `...`

for 2) see my answer in #14340

I've fixed the changes in the output ordering due to #9880, and removed the `import` at the end.
Works fine with Sage 5.11. Ready for review.

You need to change a few doctest continuation `...`  into `...:`

the new version of the patch uses `....:`.

Note for reviewers: there were two tricky places, one with `try ... except` and one with `yield`. All tests still pass however.

I have made a new patch with correct indentation, and it passes all tests.

for the *patchbots*:

apply trac_14339_doctests_from_french_book_v2.patch
