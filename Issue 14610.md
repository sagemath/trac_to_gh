```
sage: R.<x>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: (x+x^2).integral()
1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x^3
sage: R.<x,y>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x y')
sage: (x+x^2).integral()
...
AttributeError: 'MPowerSeries' object has no attribute 'integral'
```


I've some preliminary patch mut I'm not sure if this shoudn't be done at another level (eg Singular).

New review patch allows the denominator to lie in a different parent (as long as it coerces into that of the numerator), deals with an endless-loop bug, and adds doc and comments. If you are fine with it, Frederic and Florent, this is positive_review!
