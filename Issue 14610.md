I've some preliminary patch mut I'm not sure if this shoudn't be done at another level (eg Singular).

New review patch allows the denominator to lie in a different parent (as long as it coerces into that of the numerator), deals with an endless-loop bug, and adds doc and comments. If you are fine with it, Frederic and Florent, this is positive_review!
