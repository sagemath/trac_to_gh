Keywords: integral multivariate power series


```
sage: R.<x>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x')
sage: (x+x^2).integral()
1/2*x^2 + 1/3*x^3
sage: R.<x,y>=PowerSeriesRing(QQ, 'x y')
sage: (x+x^2).integral()
...
AttributeError: 'MPowerSeries' object has no attribute 'integral'

I've some preliminary patch mut I'm not sure if this shoudn't be done at another level (eg Singular).

It seems that there is no conflict with  #14334

2 remarks:

* there is a typo in quo_rem:  increassing

* please use the new syntax ValueError('please')

I have made a review patch. If you are happy with the few small changes I have made, you can set a positive review.

New review patch allows the denominator to lie in a different parent (as long as it coerces into that of the numerator), deals with an endless-loop bug, and adds doc and comments. If you are fine with it, Frederic and Florent, this is positive_review!
