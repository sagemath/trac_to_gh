# Issue 21106: bad chosen representations of k-regular sequences

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2016-08-26 11:13:08

Deal with the troubles coming from bad chosen representations of k-regular sequences, where `mu[0]*right != right`. (This makes troubles as leading zeros of digit expansions should not influence the result.)

`tranpose` was removed due to the discussion started at ticket:21295#comment:32 issue 6. This lead to a non-minor change here, as dealing with regenerated sequences and transposing sequences needs to go hand-in-hand during construction. I now remember, that this was the original motivation for having `transpose` in the constructor. However, I have now created a solution here adapting to this situation.
