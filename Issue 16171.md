CC:  pdehaye stumpc5 vivianepons @mantepse

The current implementation of `combinatorial_map` modifies some methods of objects in order to tag them as being a "combinatorial map". In this ticket we propose an implementation of a database and a decorator which register the methods but do not modify them.

Currently we have the following proposals
- `u/vdelecroix/experimental-combinatorial_map_database`
- ... [add yours]

I will not work on this anymore before having some **constructive** comments. Or even better, somebody else contribution. If you apply my branch the file `sage/combinat/combinatorial_map.py` becomes almost empty and I might fix it later on.
