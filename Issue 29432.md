This was never quite right,


```
case "$with_python" in
     3*) SAGE_PYTHON_VERSION=3;;
```


because it accepts `--with-python=3.9` and ignores everything after the 3 (it should throw an error in my opinion). Not a big deal now since it will be deleted soon.

There's a lot of other python-2.x stuff to be removed in the build system, scripts, docs, and SPKGs, but I think you are aware of that and plan to deal with it later? If so this is fine as a first step.

Good point. Let me make this a warning actually.

Yes, there's a lot to be done, and there is a meta-ticket for that: #29141.
