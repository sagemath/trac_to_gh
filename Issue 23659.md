No, I have not extended to the semistandard case.  I must also admit that I am not sure about the proper framework.  Growth diagrams in the strict sense (that is, as in Fomin's papers) work only for partial fillings (that is, at most one cross in each row and column).

I included the Knuth and the Burge generalization of Schensted because I had code available, and because I wanted to make the framework as permissive as possible.  However, it would be better to make Knuth's "trick" (standardization of fillings) a separate tool.

I suspect that this would work with shifted shapes.  Do you know whether it would work with LLMS insertion?

> Also, this corresponds to the Haiman insertion, right? If so, please add a reference! 


Although I didn't do this for the other classical insertion algorithms covered in Fomin's 1995 paper, I'll do so.  It's a good idea.
