Can this insertion also handle words with repeated letters? If so, tests need to be added for this case. Also, this corresponds to the Haiman insertion, right? If so, please add a reference!

No, I have not extended to the semistandard case.  I must also admit that I am not sure about the proper framework.  Growth diagrams in the strict sense (that is, as in Fomin's papers) work only for partial fillings (that is, at most one cross in each row and column).

I included the Knuth and the Burge generalization of Schensted because I had code available, and because I wanted to make the framework as permissive as possible.  However, it would be better to make Knuth's "trick" (standardization of fillings) a separate tool.

I suspect that this would work with shifted shapes.  Do you know whether it would work with LLMS insertion?

> Also, this corresponds to the Haiman insertion, right? If so, please add a reference! 

Although I didn't do this for the other classical insertion algorithms covered in Fomin's 1995 paper, I'll do so.  It's a good idea.

Please set to positive review again when happy :-)

Well, it would be good to get the semistandard insertion since this is really what I need! I guess one can do it using standardization!

For the LLMS insertion see Chapter 6.2 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3569.pdf

OK, but not in this ticket. I have thought about it meanwhile, maybe I can do something...

I can't find standardization in Chapter 6.2, could you tell me the page?

Oh, I thought you asked about the growth diagrams. See the LLMS paper Section 10.

OK, thanks! I am not completely sure how easy this will be - there is some maths to do, too.
(LLMS insertion is implemented, but only for the standard case)

I created #24659 for that.

I'll work on it as soon as possible.  Help appreciated :-)

Yes, looks good to me. As I said it would be good to have the semistandard version of this as well!
