I'm not getting this in Sage 5.2 or 5.6 _or_ 5.9+#14330.  Can you give more details about the situation?  Maybe this is related to your using an incomplete ldap version of sagenb.

Replying to [comment:1 kcrisman]:

I just tested with plain 5.10 and this bug does not occurred. So it must have been something with ldap or some additional package. I guess this one can be closed.
