If the package `dot2tex` is installed, but Graphviz is not, the documentation fails to build (see log below)

For the same reason, the following optional doctest fails:

```
sage -t src/sage/categories/loop_crystals.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/categories/loop_crystals.py", line 118, in sage.categories.loop_crystals.LoopCrystals.ParentMethods.digraph
Failed example:
    G.latex_options()  # optional - dot2tex
Expected:
    LaTeX options for Digraph on 29 vertices:
    {...'edge_options': <function <lambda> at 0x...>,...}
Got:
    LaTeX options for Digraph on 29 vertices: {}
**********************************************************************
```
However, this test is not actually run by default because of #23997.

Wouldn't it be better to check for wether Graphviz is installed during the installation of dot2tex an raise an appropriate error telling the user to install graphviz if it is not? I find it a bit confusing that now after a succesfull:

```
sage -i dot2tex
```

one still can have  `have_dot2tex()` return false.

I also checked the sage code on occurrences of dot2tex, and they where all related to `set_latex_options` of graphs or things that render like graphs. The documentation of `set_latex_options` also clearly state that graph layout programs have to be one of the graphviz layout programs.

It is in theory possible for another program then one from graphviz suite to generate dot files, however all things that I have seen outside of sage (like [gprof2dot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot)) all have graphviz as a dependency since the dot file is a standard created by graphviz and graphviz provides a lot of utilities for generating/manipulating dot files.

I am for a hard dependency as well since at the moment dot2tex in sage is completely useless without graphviz, and I think it will be very unlikely that use cases of the dot file format will pop up in the future that do not in some way or another require graphviz.

I tested that with this ticket dot2tex fails to install if graphviz is not installed and that it correctly installs if graphviz is installed. The error message looks very clear.
