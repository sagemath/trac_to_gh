```
sage: (-p).parent() is p.parent()

Note that this depends crucially on the ``@`fork`, without it things work just fine. Intuitively, I suppose that since E is created in the forked process, the main process where I'm negating p does not know about E and therefore creates a new parent. However, I'm not sure how to fix this.

Since this definitely worked a few months ago, my gut says that it might have something to do with the changes introduced in #11474 and I've taken the liberty to include some of you who worked on this. I hope that's okay for you.

It looks like the problem is in the point sets, not the elliptic curves:

```
sage: A=parent(p)
sage: B=parent(-p)
sage: id(A)==id(B)
False
sage: A._codomain
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Rational Field
sage: id(A._codomain)==id(B._codomain)
True
```

In fact, even the "Spectrum of Ration Field" is multiply instantiated (it arises as domain of the point set. Do we really get any mileage out of carrying around the formal homset stuff?

```
sage: A._domain
Spectrum of Rational Field
sage: id(A._domain)==id(B._domain)
False
```

We can create nonidentical-but-equal pointsets without fork:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([2,3])
sage: A=E.point_set()
sage: B=E.point_set(QQ)
sage: parent(A(3,6,1)+B(3,6,1)) is A
True
sage: parent(B(3,6,1)+B(3,6,1)) is A
True
sage: A is B
False
sage: A==B
True
```

I use the elliptic curve & point stuff in Sage all the time, and never have any use for that.  I don't use point-sets at all.

Not explicitly perhaps, but it does get created (unless "parent" triggers something lazy here):

```
sage: parent(EllipticCurve([2,3])(3,6,1))
Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Rational Field
```

which is why I'm slightly concerned about "carrying around" this stuff. It may be OK: The point set should obviously carry around the field (in the form of the `._domain` attribute) and it may be that "Spectrum of Rational Field" is a sufficiently lightweight/permanent wrapper that it doesn't hurt too much.

    "url": "https://github.com/sagemath/sagetest/issues/16771#issuecomment-221519",
    "user": "https://github.com/nbruin"
}
```

It looks to me the problem with point sets indeed explains the problem:
point_homset is a cached_method, but the "fork" construction somehow circumvents the cache:

```
sage: p=compute_E()
sage: p.parent()._codomain.point_homset.cache
{}
sage: 2*p
...
sage: p.parent()._codomain.point_homset.cache
{((None,),
  ()): Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Rational Field}
```

A new pointset was created! If we avoid this, everything works fine:

```
sage: p.parent()._codomain.point_homset.set_cache(parent(p))
sage: 2*p
(-23/144 : 2827/1728 : 1)
```

This is probably explained by:

```
sage: p.parent().__reduce_ex__(2)
(<class 'sage.schemes.generic.homset.SchemeHomsetFactory'>,
 (Spectrum of Rational Field,
  Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Rational Field,
  Category of schemes over Integer Ring,
  Integer Ring,
  False,
  True))
sage: p.parent()._codomain.__reduce_ex__(2)
(<function sage.structure.factory.generic_factory_unpickle>,
 (<class 'sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.constructor.EllipticCurveFactory'>,
  (6, 4, 'beta2'),
  (Rational Field, (0, 0, 0, 2, 3)),
  {}))
```

so, when p gets pickled, then `p.parent()` gets pickled and as a result the elliptic curve as well, but the cache doesn't get pickled (as you can see, the elliptic curve gets created "fresh").

The problem could be solved by making point sets unique, but probably you'd have to make spec unique in the process as well; it is not at the moment:

```
sage: a=Spec(QQ); b=Spec(QQ)
sage: a is b , a == b
(False, True)
```


Incidentally, this also explains:

```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([2,3])
sage: A=E.point_homset()
sage: B=E.point_homset(QQ)
sage: A is B
False
sage: [A is c for c in E.point_homset.cache.values()]
[True, False]
```

two entries in the cache: one for each input type. However, these point sets seem a little better coordinated than the ones resulting from unpickling:

```
sage: 2*A(3,6,1)
(-23/144 : 2827/1728 : 1)
sage: 2*B(3,6,1)
(-23/144 : 2827/1728 : 1)
sage: A(3,6,1)+B(3,6,1)
(-23/144 : 2827/1728 : 1)
```

Indeed.  I am now experimenting with making `AffineScheme` inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`, and in fact this already gives the desired results without any special changes to point sets:

```


```

sage: a is b , a == b
(True, True)
```


```
sage: E=EllipticCurve([2,3])
sage: A=E.point_homset()

```

It seems to work quite well, except it took me some time to figure out the following caveat:

```
sage: class X(UniqueRepresentation):
....:     def __init__(self, x, y=None):
....:         self.x = x
....:         self.y = y
....:
sage: A = X(1)
sage: B = X(1)
sage: C = X(1, None)
sage: A is B
True
sage: B is C
False
```

Apparently it makes a difference whether the default `None` argument is explicitly given or not.  I accept that this may be a technical limitation that isn't worth fixing, though.

Certainly not here. Anyway, the problem is that caching happens in the `__classcall__` method that is inherited from `CachedRepresentation`, and this is unaware of default arguments to the `__init__` method.

The point is that ``@`cached_function`, that is used to decorate the `__classcall__`, only takes into account the argspec of `__classcall__` (which is generic), but not the argspec of `__init__`.

Default arguments are taken into account by a so-called argument fixer. Normally, this is created using the argspec of the to-be-wrapped method (here: `__classcall__`). But it could be possible to find a mechanism to create an argument fixer using the argspec of a different method.

Problem: Suppose you have a hierarchy of classes. They all inherit the `__classcall__` from `CachedRepresentation`, but have their own `__init__` (or some just inherit it), and thus the classes should inherit different instances of the cached `__classcall__` function, each with its own argument fixer.

One may think that this could be possible to do, for example, in `sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass.__cinit__`: This is where the classcall is assigned to a class. But I am not sure if `__init__` is available at that point. After all, the class for which we want to inspect `__init__` is just to-be-created.

Perhaps this is worth a different ticket, perhaps not (because of the bad ration of complication and gain).

`@`pbruin

So what Simon is recommending (I believe) is to add a method:

```python
@staticmethod
def __classcall__(cls, R, S=None):
    # Do any other parsing/standardization that's needed here
    # In particular, if S is None, then set it to ZZ following
    #   the __init__ of Scheme
    return super(AffineScheme, cls).__classcall__(R, S)
```

or perhaps call it `__classcall_private__` (so it doesn't get accidentally used by subclasses). It almost seems like this should go one further to make `Scheme` a `UniqueRepresentation`, but IDK how much more work that would be.

However I disagree with this change:

```diff

I think it would be much better to instead change it to a non-unique parent.

Homsets are cached by *identity* of domain and codomain. Hence, if domain or codomain are non-unique parents, then homsets automatically are non-unique parents as well. However, I think it is true (and already documented, that's why I disagree with this change) that homsets of unique parents are unique parents.

I thought about this, but I think it does not make sense, because `Scheme` is just an abstract base class for general schemes, which don't usually have a set of defining data that determine them uniquely up to isomorphism.  Affine schemes are uniquely determined by their coordinate ring, elliptic curves by their base ring and Weierstrass coefficients, but general schemes are just too general.  We could do this for affine and projective *spaces* **A**<sup>*n*</sup> and **P**<sup>*n*</sup>, though.

You are right, and this is a reason why people are forced to use forking for long computations...
> It's also scary that we're creating multivariate polynomial rings (and leaking them!) just to construct a point on an elliptic curve (in fact all this junk already is created if just the elliptic curve is created).
In this case it is probably because an elliptic curve is also a projective curve.  From `EllipticCurve_generic`:

```python
def __init__(self, K, ainvs):
    self.__base_ring = K
    self.__ainvs = tuple(K(a) for a in ainvs)
    if self.discriminant() == 0:
        raise ArithmeticError("invariants " + str(ainvs) + " define a singular curve")
    PP = projective_space.ProjectiveSpace(2, K, names='xyz');
    x, y, z = PP.coordinate_ring().gens()
    a1, a2, a3, a4, a6 = ainvs
    f = y**2*z + (a1*x + a3*z)*y*z \
        - (x**3 + a2*x**2*z + a4*x*z**2 + a6*z**3)
    plane_curve.ProjectiveCurve_generic.__init__(self, PP, f)
```

I thought `UniqueRepresentation`'s are weakly cached, so these aren't truly leaked, but instead waiting for Sage to use up all it's memory before collecting them? I know polynomial rings use their own (weak) cache and exhibit similar output to the above.

Related question: Do we have a (documented) mechanism for freeing the `UniqueRepresentation` cache? Should we if we don't?

Do you mean: removing an entry from the cache even when the object still exists? That sounds like a bad idea to sanction with a formal API. However, you can do it if you want, since you can find the cache if you work at it:

```
sage: A=AbelianGroup([0])
sage: k=[k for k,v in sage.structure.unique_representation.CachedRepresentation.__classcall__.cache.iteritems() if v is A][0]; k
((sage.groups.abelian_gps.abelian_group.AbelianGroup_class, (0,), 'f'), ())
sage: del sage.structure.unique_representation.CachedRepresentation.__classcall__.cache[k]
sage: B=AbelianGroup([0])
sage: A is B
False
```

However, sage behaviour after this is likely to be questionable (so, basically no worse than before).

That doesn't prove that properly solving #13447 would leave the memory leak in place. `permstore` was only introduced because we had examples where the deletion of polynomial rings caused memory corruption in libsingular. We don't know that `permstore` is the only link that prevents them from being deleted (and since we're not testing that, it's quite probable it's not). Memory management of polynomial rings is just broken.

I do agree with that.

I do find it funny that with the fork/pickle idiom, we're basically reintroducing an extremely heavy-handed version of PARI's grepile memory management (except that pickling is an even harder problem to solve and, as we can see here, is probably broken for pretty much any sufficiently complicated data structure).
