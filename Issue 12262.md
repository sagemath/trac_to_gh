This is a small issue where one function returns a slightly wrong type (missing a const), which gcc just glosses over.

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/matplotlib-1.1.0.p0.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/matplotlib-1.1.0.p0.spkg).
