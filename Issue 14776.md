LGTM.   I don't see any problems with this; it's also safe since it doesn't touch code, just docs. 

Improving what is listed in the reference manual for logic is a good idea, since it is currently spartan, but this should be in another ticket.

Apply this last.  This patch includes updated docstrings, but depends on the other patches.

The third patch listed in the attachments, trac_15013_logic_docstrings.patch, is the only patch that should be integrated into sage for this ticket.  The first two patches are the patches for the two dependencies for this ticket, #14951 and #14952, which I put here for the convenience of the reviewer.

To reduce confusion, I think it is better not to do that. The "Dependencies" field should be sufficient. I removed those other patches which do not belong to this ticket.

There are problems building the documentation:

```
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.12.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/booleval.py:docstring of sage.logic.booleval:9: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.12.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/booleval.py:docstring of sage.logic.booleval.eval_f:14: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.12.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/booleval.py:docstring of sage.logic.booleval.eval_formula:16: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
dochtml.log:[logic    ] /mazur/release/merger/sage-5.12.beta4/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/logic/propcalc.py:docstring of sage.logic.propcalc:25: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
```

The correct syntax is (note the use of a single vs. double colons)

```
EXAMPLES:

Some explantory text::

    sage: some_doctest
```
