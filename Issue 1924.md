Today in the sage seminar Cl√©ment Pernet demonstrated that in the naive matrix multiply algorithm (used as a basecase for all others)

Specifically, for computing C = A*B,


```
for i in A.nrows:
    for j in B.ncols:
        for k in B.nrows:
            C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
```


is bad for the cache as one is iterating over the columns of B in the inner loop. Changing this to 


```
for i in A.nrows:
    for k in B.nrows:
        for j in B.ncols:
            C[i,j] += A[i,k] * B[k,j]
```


gives the same result, but much better cache performance.

There is something fishy about this patch. It touches the same file in the same area (hunk 1) and that causes rejects:

```
sage$ patch -p1 --dry-run < 1924-matrix-mul-loop-order.patch

```


There is also an extra comma:`cdef mod_int A_row_k,`. So: negative review for now :(, but I am sure Robert will be quick to update. :)

I just applied the patch without any funny business to 2.10:

```
sage: hg_sage.apply('http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/1924/1924-matrix-mul-loop-order.patch?format=raw')
Attempting to load remote file: http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/1924/1924-matrix-mul-loop-order.patch?format=raw

applying /Users/was/.sage/temp/teragon.local/47537/tmp_1.patch
```


After applying the patch I do *not* have a line like this:

```
 def mod_int A_row_k,
```

This is because the first part of the diff adds that line, but the
second part removes it.  

By the way, on my laptop before and after applying this patch:

BEFORE:

```
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),500); b = random_matrix(GF(101),500)
sage: sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 0.38 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.40 s
Wall time: 0.42
sage: sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(101),1000)
sage: sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 2.63 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 2.76 s
Wall time: 2.78
```


AFTER:

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),500); b = random_matrix(GF(101),500)
sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 0.23 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.25 s
Wall time: 0.25
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(101),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(101),1000)
sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 1.60 s, sys: 0.13 s, total: 1.73 s
Wall time: 1.73
```


Not bad for basically swapping the order of two for loops!

By the way, on my laptop (core 2 duo 2.6Ghz) magma kicks ass on the above benchmark:

```
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.040'
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.200'
```


It's not their timer lying, because one gets the same timing externally via wall time from Sage:

```
sage: aa = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000))')
sage: bb = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),1000))')
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.20
sage: aa = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500))')
sage: bb = magma('Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(101),500))')
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.04
sage: time cc=aa*bb
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.03
```


Magma has special optimized matrices for such a small prime (101). 
For the slightly larger p=10007 we have

```
sage: magma.eval('a := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(10007),1000)); b := Random(MatrixAlgebra(GF(10007),1000));')
''
sage: magma.eval('time c := a*b')
'Time: 0.860'
```


and in Sage (now):

```
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(10007),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(10007), 1000)
sage: time c=a*b
CPU times: user 1.72 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 1.85 s
Wall time: 1.85
sage: a = random_matrix(GF(10007),1000); b = random_matrix(GF(10007), 1000)
sage: time c=a._multiply_linbox(b)
CPU times: user 0.88 s, sys: 0.12 s, total: 1.01 s
Wall time: 0.90
```

Well, William's reexported patch applies cleanly. But since it is about 2kb smaller than the original patch somebody has to give me at least that the original patch was fishy ;)

The original patch had two diffs in it...I guess I'll try and avoid doing that from now on. Looks like William was able to respond faster than I was though.
