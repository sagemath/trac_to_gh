Keywords: windows cygwin pari

The test suite for Pari itself (e.g. `make test-all`) is broken on Cygwin.  Each test is given as a file containing commands that is piped to `gp`'s stdin.  However, it exits prematurely after reading just a few lines of each test.

The attached patch fixes the issue.  I didn't update the patch level on the package version yet, since it would conflict with #22633 (which is higher priority to fix first).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22635

The patch obviously makes sense but it should be reported upstream.

Since the patches are rather simple, maybe it's easier to add both patches on the same ticket (say, #22633)?

That would be pointless as there are already separate tickets and the issues are unrelated.
