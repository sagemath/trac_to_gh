Inside, the homology of an auxiliary simplicial complex is computed. For sufficiently complicated cases, vector spaces of dimension 0 are sometimes returned even if all higher-dimensional homology groups vanish. My sheaf cohomology code wrongly assumed that this would not be the case.

Looks good, but misses the reference to this ticket.

Is it possible to get these 0-dimensional spaces even in negative degree? In general, is it how homology of this associated complex should behave? I.e. was it really a defect of toric code or there should be a follow-up ticket open for homology computation?

I've added a reference to this trac ticket.

I don't think that the homology every returns negative degrees, but even if that were the case it would be mathematically correct as long as the homology group is zero-dimensional. As is, the auxiliary simplicial complex is higher-dimensional (but of course has no homology in degrees larger) than the dimension of the variety. So we can't blame the homology code...
