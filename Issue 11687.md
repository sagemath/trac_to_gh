Keywords: MAX_COLUMN, line splitting

When printing list of matrices, sage use `MAX_COLUMN` to split the list. 

```
sage: m = matrix([[1,2,3,4]]*3)
sage: [m]*10
[
[1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4],

[1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]  [1 2 3 4]
[1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4], [1 2 3 4]
]
}}} 
By default `MAX_COLUMN = 70`. We should ask the terminal if possible.
