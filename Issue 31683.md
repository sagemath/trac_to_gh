Building `pynac` fails in Sage 9.4.beta1 when a user has set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.1`.

This is due to an outdated libtool shipped with pynac, similar to https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=97865, which fails to use `-Wl,-undefined -Wl,dynamic_lookup`





Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31920

does this mean we just need to re-run a modern autoconf on Pynac source?
