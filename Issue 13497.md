I've rebased.  Patchbot, apply trac_13701.2.patch

Note also that conv.py has zero doctests - who knows what that code is really up to?  Among other things, it refers to

```
PATH = SAGE_ROOT + "/src/tables/modular/gamma0/db/"
```

which clearly makes no sense.  In fact, the only touches of this code in AGES have been essentially auto-produced.  I'm going to ask on sage-devel about this, in fact.

Answering here rather than on list. It is clearly unused unless, may be, by some unidentified optional/experimental spkg. The line you quote is followed by:

```

which would be making a big splash on any sage-on-gentoo install (or the fedora port by pcpa and before that his Mandriva one). The fact that we haven't noticed seem to indicate that it is never called from anywhere by default.

William confirmed this - see #13910.

André, can you do this ticket but without that file included, so that removing it at #13910 won't conflict with the patch here?

André, do you mind rebasing with respect to those?  In fact, you could probably just cut out hunks of your patch by hand to make it compatible with #10353 - this is great that we are able to remove that cruft, I just assumed it was actually used!
