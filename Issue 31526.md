In the docstring of `declare_superset`, the following changes should be made:

```diff
    def declare_superset(self, *subsets):
        r"""
-        Declare ``self`` to be a subset of each of the given supersets.
+        Declare ``self`` to be a superset of each of the given subsets.

        INPUT:

-        - ``supersets`` -- other subsets of the same manifold
+        - ``subsets`` -- other subsets of the same manifold
```

In the doctests of `declare_subset`, the line

```
sage: M.declare_subset(V)
```

may look surprising at first glance, since it amounts to making all previously introduced subsets `U1`, `U2` and `V` equal to the whole manifold `M`. Maybe a comment should be added about this, illustrated by

```
sage: M.equal_subset_family()
Set {M, U1, U2, V} of open subsets of the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
