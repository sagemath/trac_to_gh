From google spreadsheet which no one reads `X-(`


```
[2,2,2,2,1,1,1] in DegreeSequences(7) 
```


returns "true."

Sorryyyyyyyyy `T_T`

I forgot the first (and easiest) part of this theorem : the sum of all integers must be even. There even was a "S" variable equal to this sum that wasn't even ever used in the code `T_T`

What is google spreadsheet by the way ?

No idea what degree sequences mean `:-/`

Open your sagenb notebook and on the top right you will see "Report a problem". That goes to a google form. And the bug report gets collected in [this google spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) (which no one reads).

Some graph stuff. It's fixed with this patch. You can review it yourself if you want, just notice that on wikipedia the "Erdos-Gallai" theorem begins by saying that the sum of the degrees must be even, and this is exactly what I had forgotten in this patch. Otherwise somebody will probably review it someday `^^;`

We have this amount of bug reports, and they are just rotting there ?....

Given the [wikipedia definition,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)#Degree_sequence) this patch looks correct to me.

EDIT: BTW, this passes all doctests in `combinat/degree_sequences.pyx`, `graphs/generators` and `graphs/graph_generators.py` where the `DegreeSequences` is used.

Unfortunately, yes.

By the way, I just opened a bunch of bug reports from #15496 to #15504 based on the bug reports in that spreadsheet. If you intend to open any ticket, just check against the ones I have already opened.

Oh. Can we remove lines from this spreadsheet once they have been translated into trac tickets ?

No idea which account that google spreadsheet belongs to. Perhaps you can ask on sage-devel.

Well we should definitely write about that... `T_T`

Do you ? Do I ?

Go ahead. You can make a more dramatic mail than I can `;-)` That's probably a good thing in this case!

I'm always too dramatic (and aggressive). That's why I wanted too give the guys a rest `:-PPP`

Eek, I hope that degree sequence wasn't my fault five years ago...

Harald can give you write permissions on this document, guys.  And I highly recommend putting some note in the "Comments" field I created a year or two ago that these are opened.  If we were really on it we'd even respond to the emailers!  Maybe I need to take a month and do this follow-up full time... except I have a day job.
