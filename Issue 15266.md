Sorryyyyyyyyy `T_T`

I forgot the first (and easiest) part of this theorem : the sum of all integers must be even. There even was a "S" variable equal to this sum that wasn't even ever used in the code `T_T`

What is google spreadsheet by the way ?

Open your sagenb notebook and on the top right you will see "Report a problem". That goes to a google form. And the bug report gets collected in [this google spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pCwvGVwSMxTzT6E2xNdo5fA) (which no one reads).

Some graph stuff. It's fixed with this patch. You can review it yourself if you want, just notice that on wikipedia the "Erdos-Gallai" theorem begins by saying that the sum of the degrees must be even, and this is exactly what I had forgotten in this patch. Otherwise somebody will probably review it someday `^^;`
