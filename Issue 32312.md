MPIR, a fork of GMP, has not been updated upstream. The latest release, 3.0.0, is from 2017-03-01 (https://mpir.org/downloads.html). 

Sage currently provides an SPKG for MPIR as a configurable alternative to GMP. We should remove this option and package, as previously suggested in #29620#comment:10

 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32549

It seems there are some commits since then (the last is from December 2020 for Linux version and August 2021 for Windows version), perhaps should we ask to the people involved in MPIR how they see the future of MPIR ?

Regardless of the state of MPIR upstream, sage never really developed a coherent plan for packages that are substitutes for one another. The `./configure` options that are available now don't really make sense, and the best thing to do for our end users is to eliminate the confusion (if also the choice).

The upstream (Bill) told me some time ago that due to Spectre and other CPU vulns discovered few years ago, parts of MPIR became obsolete, as speedups there relied on CPUs being unpatched.

IMHO it's semi-abandonware now.

this option should be renamed `gmp`, and respective tests should drop `# optional` tag.
Indeed, it just calls a gmp/mpir function (which are more or less the same, and mpir provided a replacement for gmp there).

```
sage: 100.binomial(45, algorithm='mpir')
61448471214136179596720592960
```

see, it still works, without any mpir installed.
