# Issue 19209: Hook statistics in binary Trees

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: boussica

Original creation time: 2015-10-21 15:52:03

Keywords: binary trees, hook

We add a hook statistics on binary trees.

The hook of a vertex v is the union of {v}, its leftmost and·           
rightmost branches.

There is a unique way to partition the vertices in hooks.               
The number of hooks in such a partition is the hook number of the tree. 

We can obtain this partition recursively by extracting the root's hook· 
and iterating the processus on each tree of the remaining forest.

A few remarks:

- it seems better to use 'left' and 'right', rather than 0 and 1 for the side selection

- syntax of INPUT and OUTPUT is wrong; must be

```
INPUT:

here
```

with just one colon, and a blank line just below the INPUT line

rather use `"""` for the doc start and end (not `'''`)

maybe call the function `comb_list` (more explicit)

If you want a review, you should set the status to "needs_review"

Salut, Adrien et Bérénice.

Quand on travaille à plusieurs sur les mêmes tickets, on peut utiliser comme nom de branche un truc du style `public/hook_statistics_in_binary_trees` pour ne pas avoir a changer le nom de la branche à chaque fois.

So you do not want this to be reviewed ??

Anyway, you can replace

```
if len(L)>0:
```

by

```
if len(L):
```

and also

```
tn[0]=tn[0]+1
```

by

```
tn[0] += 1
```

Hello, are you still not interested by a review ? Have you abandoned this ticket ?

I did not get the definition of hook upon first reading.  Thus, here are some suggestions for the docstrings.  A reference where one can find a definition would be good, too.

I'd like to submit this statistic to http://FindStat.org - would this be OK?



```
    Return the comb of a tree.

    There are two combs in a binary tree: a left comb and a right comb.
    Consider the vertices of the leftmost (resp. rightmost) branch of 
    the root, excluding the root itself.  The left (resp. right) comb 
    is the list of right (resp. left) subtree of each of these vertices.

    INPUT:

    - ``side`` -- (default: 'left') set to 'left' to obtain the left 
      comb, and to 'right' to obtain the right comb.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of binary trees.
```



```
    Return the number of hooks.

    The hook of a vertex v is the subtree that consists of {v}, the
    leftmost branch and the rightmost branch of v.

    The set of hooks partitions the binary tree.  The number of hooks
    in such a partition is the hook number of the tree.

    We can obtain this partition recursively by extracting the root's
    hook and repeating the process on each tree of the remaining
    forest.
```

Changing status from new to needs_review.

ok, let me put that in needs_review, after a mail exchange with Adrien

Everything looks good to me (it seems a few people have already looked it over and made comments). The one thing I'd like to see (and might add myself) is ASCII art representations of the non-trivial examples, since they really help illustrate the definitions.

Somebody can set a positive review on my behalf once they've verified that everything is ok with my additions to the documentation.

Does anybody find my docstring proposals (from comment 13) helpful?  If so, I'd add them.

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-04-11 15:06:48

here is a new git branch with some little doc and code cleanups.

I am still not happy with the documentation, in particular

* what is a "branch" ? it should be defined somewhere..
