Keywords: primes

`primes(start, stop=None)` is supposed to return an iterator over all primes between `start` and `stop-1`, but it confuses the two arguments when only one is given.


```
sage: list(primes(start=5, stop=10))    # this is OK
[5, 7]

sage: next(primes(start=5))    # should be 5
2

sage: list(primes(start=5))    # this should not terminate!
[2, 3]

sage: it = primes(start=25)
sage: [next(it) for _ in range(5)]    # this should be [29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

This is the intended behavior: the docstring says 'This command is like the Python 2 "xrange" command, except it only iterates over primes.' But either the documentation needs to be more clear or the behavior needs to be changed (with a deprecation period).

Related tickets: #18298 and #30121 (and #29760). Now that we are on python 3, the `prime_range` function should return an iterator instead of a list (and act like the `range` command).

Clearly this behavior is meant for arguments given as positional arguments. I agree that when `start` is given as a keyword argument, it should never be taken as "stop".
