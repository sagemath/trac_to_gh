*Do not merge until May 2015! *

This deletes the deprecation warning and its documentation in Transducer.cartesian_product. This warning should be given one year, that is until May 2015.


See #16061 for the reasons of this deprecation warning. From now on, the output will always be the new (desired) one. The old output can be obtained by Transducer.intersection.

I've reviewed this patch: I've deleted also the deprecated variable now. For me this is a positive review, so set it to positive_review in May 2015.
