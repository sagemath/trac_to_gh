**Do not merge until May 2015! **

This deletes the deprecation warning and its documentation in Transducer.cartesian_product. This warning should be given one year, that is until May 2015.


See #16061 for the reasons of this deprecation warning. From now on, the output will always be the new (desired) one. The old output can be obtained by Transducer.intersection.
