# Issue 15440: Packages shipping too old libtool fail to build on Cygwin64

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jpflori

Original creation time: 2014-01-15 10:00:28

CC:  kcrisman dimpase tscrim

Keywords: cygwin libtool

This includes:
* libpng (running autorconf -fiv updates it correctly),
* freetype (running ./autogen.sh updates it correctly),
* gd (running autorconf -fiv updates it correctly).

Some of these packages may also be outdated so an upgrade might solves the issue.

Latest version of libpng is ok.
See #16099.

freetype has been updated as well and is ok now.
See #15561.

It seems latest gd 2.1.0 still ships a too ancient libtool.

Everything is ok now, even gd which we autoreconf ourselves, see #17334.

what do you want to do, is this invalid? Please set milestone then.

I think this was more of a task/meta-ticket.

There is nothing to do here anymore, everything was fixed in other tickets.
