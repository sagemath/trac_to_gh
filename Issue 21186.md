Hello,

Thank you for adding this.

Here `n` is not the order of the CCC but the dimension. The order of CCC(n) is `d*2^d` (You could mention it in the documentation).
I suggest to replace `n` with `d` to avoid confusion with the order.


Use `<` instead of `\lt`. As you can see in the documentation displayed in a terminal, `\lt` is replaced with `lt`, which is not nice. Also, you can avoid using `\lfloor...\rfloor` and give directly the value for `n` even and `n` odd. I don't know what to do with the `oplus`. Actually I don't knwo what you mean by `x oplus 2^y`.

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle?
Signature:      graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(n)
Docstring:     
   Returns the cube-connected cycle of order n.

   The cube-connected cycle of order n is the n-dimensional hypercube
   with each of its vertices replaced by a cycle of length n. The
   construction is as follows: Construct vertex (x,y) for 0 <= x lt
   2^n, 0 <= y lt n. For each vertex, (x,y), add an edge between it
   and (x, (y-1) mod n)), (x,(y+1) mod n), and (x oplus 2^y, y)

   INPUT:

      * "n" -- The dimension of the desired hypercube as well as the
        length of the cycle to be placed at each vertex of the
        n-dimensional hypercube. n must be a positive integer.

   EXAMPLES:

   The diameter of cube-connected cycles for n gt 3 is 2n+ lfloor
   frac{n}{2} rfloor -2

      sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(9)
      sage: g.diameter()
      20

   All vertices have degree 3 when n gt 1

      sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(12)
      sage: all(g.degree(v) == 3 for v in g)
      True
```


For the last example, observe that CCC(2) is a cycle of order 8, and so all vertices have degree 2.

The error message could be changed to `greater than 0`.

Best,
David.

PS: switch the ticket to need review when ready. It is still as new...

Hi, thanks for the comments.

I will add the suggested items. \oplus is for the bitwise xor operation. I am not sure the best way to have that in the docs? Maybe just `^`?

I tried in both command line and module and `G.add_edge((x, y), (x.__xor__(pow(2, y)), y))` is working well. 
Apparently, `^` is the standard python3 xor https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html, so you can let it as is. 
Exponentiation is done with `**` in python3, so it will become the standard, and mod is `%`.

Your construction does not follow the wolfram definition where `CCC(1)` has loops and `CCC(2)` has multiple (parallel) edges.

```
sage: graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1).has_loops()
False
sage: graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(2).allows_multiple_edges()
False
```

So either you add necessary cases to strictly follow the wolfram definition, or you follow the usual assumption in graph theory that `CCC(1)` is an edge and so vertices have degree 1, and `CCC(2)` is a cycle of order 8 and so its vertices have degree 2.

If you check the original paper by Preparata and Vuillemin in 1981 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358660, you will see that the definition is slightly different and more general (extra vertices can be added).
If you remind me, I can check on Monday in reference books such as `J. de Rumeur, Communication dans les réseaux de processeurs, Masson, 1994` and others.


I realize that there is an error in your code with `d=1` due to `%1` since `1%1==2%1==0`. Furthermore, the test is not good since all vertices have by definition degree less than 3.

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1)
sage: any(g.degree(v) < 3 for v in g)
True
sage: g.edges()
[]
sage: g.vertices()

In your code, some edges are added twice. A simple method to avoid that is as follows:

```
    if d<1:
        raise ValueError('d must be greater than 0.')

    G = Graph(name="Cube-Connected Cycle of dimension {}".format(d))

    for  x in range(1<<d):

    for x, y in G.vertices():
        G.add_edge((x, y), (x^(1<<y), y))

    return G
```

The `1<<y` are just minor improvements.

I'm sorry you had difficulties installing/updating sage.

I have several comments. Let's start with the easiest one:
- `Returns the cube-connected cycle of dimension `d`.` -> `Return the cube-connected cycle of dimension `d`.`
- Instead of `<=`, you can use `\leq`. It will be much nicer.

In the examples:
- `sage: d = 10` this is large. In general we try to have quick tests since there are many many tests in Sagemath. `d = 3` could be enough, non?
- `sage: d = 9`. again, 4 is large enough.
- `sage: g = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(12)` is clearly too large. 3 is enough here.

In the code:
- `if d<1:` -> `if d < 1:`
- `ValueError('d must be greater than 0.')` -> `ValueError('the dimension d must be greater than 0')` without `.` at the end. Change the test accordingly.


Now, there is something wrong with the way you handle the case `d == 1` and `d == 2`. If I use your code, I get:

```
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(1)
sage: G.edges()
[((0, 0), (0, 0), None), ((0, 0), (1, 0), None), ((1, 0), (1, 0), None)]
sage: G.has_loops()
False
sage: G.loops()
[]
sage: G = graphs.CubeConnectedCycle(2)
sage: G.edges(labels=0)

[((0, 0), (0, 1)),
 ((0, 0), (0, 1)),
 ((0, 0), (1, 0)),
 ((0, 1), (2, 1)),
 ((1, 0), (1, 1)),
 ((1, 0), (1, 1)),
 ((1, 1), (3, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (2, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (2, 1)),
 ((2, 0), (3, 0)),
 ((3, 0), (3, 1)),
 ((3, 0), (3, 1))]
sage: G.has_multiple_edges()
False
```

Could you tell me what you expect `CCC(1)` and `CCC(2)` to be ?


Also, I'm not able to build the documentation. I got:

```
OSError: [graphs   ] /Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/graph_generators.py:docstring of sage.graphs.graph_generators.GraphGenerators.CubeConnectedCycle:33: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
```

I suspect it is due to the line `The construction is as follows:`. Can you check ?

All these are only minor issues that can easily be fixed. Almost done !

According to Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube-connected_cycles#Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube-connected_cycles#Definition).
In CCC(d), each node (x,y) should have `(x,(y+1)mod d) , (x,(y-1)mod d) and (x XOR 2^y, y)` has its neighbor( or adjacent vertices)

CCC(1) can be one of the following:

1).Graph with edges: `[((0, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 1), (0, 1))]` if we dont consider a vertex to be its own neighbor unless there is a self loop.

2). A simple Graph with an edge: `[((0, 0), (1, 0))]`, If we consider a vertex to be its own neighbor as mentioned in following link [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphNeighborhood.html)

CCC(2) should be\\
Simple Graph with edges: `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

Code works fine for CCC(d>3).

There is still one ambiguity for CCC(2). It can have following edge set according to diagram or definition of CCC(2) in Wolfram :\\
1) `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

or

2) `[((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (2, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 0), (1, 1)), ((1, 1), (3, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (2, 1)), ((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((3, 0), (3, 1)), ((3, 0), (3, 1))]`

Both cases satisfy the condition given.

But sticking to this definition given in[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cube-ConnectedCycleGraph.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cube-ConnectedCycleGraph.html) The cube-connected cycle graph of order n is the graph obtained by replacing each vertex in a n-dimensional hypercube by a cycle of length n.

Option (2) of comment 32 fits well because each node in hypergraph is replaced by cycle whose x is fixed and that pattern is also followed in all CCC(d>=3).
