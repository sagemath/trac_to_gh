Would it not be better to add `from __future__ import absolute_import` then?

Changing status from needs_review to needs_info.

I thought this was not necessary since python 2.7.

Or maybe you mean, to avoid some backward move, like people re-introducing old-style imports ?

Yes exactly.

ok, this one does pass the tests (except for the 4 failures coming from somewhere else, see #20529, which prevents my patchbot to work smoothly)

I'm sorry but I keep seeing strange things in the files that you update...

What is the point of `__doc__ = r"""` instead of a normal docstring?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-05-19 15:49:15

no idea. This was there before, maybe this can stay ?


---

See #20633 for the silly `__doc__` stuff.

Suggestion: leave those modules alone in this ticket.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-05-19 15:59:14

why ? ticket #20633 can wait for its turn to come, no ?

If it's easy to make two tickets not conflict, I think that's the best way.

Two more things:

1. Are you sure you need those `from . import all` statements? I don't see the point.

2. In `src/sage/combinat/__init__.py`, can you remove those commented-out imports?

positive_review modulo the patchbot.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-05-20 10:51:26

ok, patchbot is "green", modulo the usual `4 failing doctests` from #20529

setting to positive review. Thanks !
