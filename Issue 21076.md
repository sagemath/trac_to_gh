Currently `is_isomorphic` for graphs is using the default Sage's implementation. Bliss and nauty are typically faster, so it should be possible to use them too.

It seems that we can read the graph to `dreadnaut` in some format, propably by string given by `graph6_string()` and the use the commands for it to get the result. At least that should work. For `bliss` we alreade have some support in `.pyx`-file.

(they are somewhat lacking features, but the C part might be useful).
