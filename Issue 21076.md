Currently `is_isomorphic` for graphs is using the default Sage's implementation. Bliss and nauty are typically faster, so it should be possible to use them too.

Please note that currently `is_package_installed()` is slow because we changed it to use pip.

Don't know how to do that but it would be very nice.

It seems that we can read the graph to `dreadnaut` in some format, propably by string given by `graph6_string()` and the use the commands for it to get the result. At least that should work. For `bliss` we alreade have some support in `.pyx`-file.

note that there are Python bindings for nauty here:

(they are somewhat lacking features, but the C part might be useful).

There is a bliss implementation since #17464 and nauty is handled by #25506.
