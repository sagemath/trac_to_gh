Well, I'm surprised I couldn't find any ticket about this. Perhaps I just didn't search enough but I'd like to work on this. Sage would enormously benefit from something like this:

http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/talks/2006-12-08.IMA/editor.html

I think that editor is in javascript, which is probably the best for a web aplication like the one i've got in mind: Something to compete and surpass Mathematica's natural representation capabilities.

That could be in the form of a Jupyter widget rather than in SageNB.

Closing anyway, we can revisit if there is interest again.
