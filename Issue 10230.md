Keywords: scripts upgrade extcode examples

Right now, the version of the following packages is **always** bumped in every new Sage version:

```
sage
sage_scripts
extcode
examples
```


This patch will remove the last two from this list and shift the problem of upgrading these packages to the release manager script.

It would definitely be great to decouple these 2. Since this has been posted we have a new sage_root spkg should something be done here about it as well?

I was always in the "for" camp. Unsurprisingly because it is less work for me.
I even suggest that the new version number of the spkg in question should be of the form {extcode,examples}-YYYYMMDD.

While there was no consensus on the list I suspect most people really don't care.

At least we meanwhile got rid of the "examples" spkg / repo, so the resistance may have been halved by that, too. ;-)

I wouldn't *delete* extcode's `spkg-dist` btw.; it doesn't hurt and can be used for testing / experimenting, or even still by a / the release manager.

I am very happy about that bit really.

extcode has seen some activity in 4.7.1 and is set to get some activity in 4.7.3  but we should think about these sage specific spkg that are seldom updated.

We got rid of examples what else is low on updates?
