A few comments in `quiver.py`:
* Apparently, you can replace `set(frozen).issubset(set(data.vertex_iterator()))` by `set(frozen).issubset(data.vertex_iterator())`.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: set([1,2]).issubset(G.vertex_iterator())
True
sage: set([1,10]).issubset(G.vertex_iterator())
False
```

* I don't know the size of `mlist` in this code, but it might be interesting to first convert it to a set before doing `nlist = self._nlist = sorted(x for x in data.vertex_iterator() if x not in mlist)`

* `if any((a,a) in edges for a in data.vertex_iterator()):` -> `if data.has_loops():`. Furthermore, the list `edges` could be turned to a set for the next test (2-cycles).

* There are places where you could replace `edges()` by `edge_iterator()`, but may be you prefer to let that for another ticket.

* and finally, the following block 

```
if dg.has_multiple_edges():
    multi_edges = {}
    for v1,v2,label in dg.multiple_edges():
        ...
```
  could be changed to

```
multiple_edges = dg.multiple_edges()
if multiple_edges:
    multi_edges = {}
    for v1,v2,label in multiple_edges:
        ....
```
  Indeed, the cost of `has_multiple_edges` is almost the same as `multiple_edges`, that is visiting all the edges. So we can save one call.

Testing if an element is in a list takes time `O(n)` while in a set it takes time `O(1)`. Of course, converting a list to a set has a cost, but if you to several test, it's interesting

```
sage: L = list(range(1000))
sage: S = set(L)

10 loops, best of 3: 137 ms per loop

1000 loops, best of 3: 877 µs per loop
sage: %timeit S = set(L)
10000 loops, best of 3: 21.3 µs per loop

I agree it's a minor improvement compared to other modifications.

mlist = self._mlist = list(frozen)
