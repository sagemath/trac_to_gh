```
sage: S = CuspForms(1728, 2)
sage: %time f = S.hecke_polynomial(2)
CPU times: user 17276.68 s, sys: 13.46 s, total: 17290.14 s
Wall time: 17293.59 s
sage: f
x^253 + x^251 - 2*x^249

Meanwhile, in a separate Sage session...

I fixed this at the same time as fixing #24300. Please review that ticket. Once it's reviewed and merged this can be closed.

Would be cool to have a doctest. That is a test that would take hours before but take reasonable amount after #24300.

OK, I've put the example from the bug report as a doctest. The new code gets it down from 4.5 hours to 20 seconds, but it's still on the long side for a doctest so I've flagged it with `#Â long time`.
