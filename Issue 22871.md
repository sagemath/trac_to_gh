CC:  @rwst

Keywords: documentation, trigonometric

Add an example showing expressions do not get trig-expanded if one does not expand them first, in general:


```
sage: (x, k1, k2) = var('x, k1, k2')
sage: cos((k1-k2)*x).expand_trig()
cos((k1 - k2)*x)
sage: cos((k1-k2)*x).expand().expand_trig()
cos(k1*x)*cos(k2*x) + sin(k1*x)*sin(k2*x)
```


This behavior is stated in the function's description (`For best results, self should already be expanded.`.) and this ticket proposes to illustrate it.
