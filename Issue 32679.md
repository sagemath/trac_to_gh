I disagree with this change in `generic_graph.py` as it changes the label of edges

```diff
-            sage: f(x) = -1 / x
-            sage: g(x) = 1 / (x + 1)
+            sage: f = lambda x: -1 / x
+            sage: g = lambda x: 1 / (x + 1)
             sage: G = DiGraph()
             sage: G.add_edges((i, f(i), f) for i in (1, 2, 1/2, 1/4))
             sage: G.add_edges((i, g(i), g) for i in (1, 2, 1/2, 1/4))
```

The current behavior gives

```
sage: G.edges()
[(1/4, -4, x |--> -1/x), (1/4, 4/5, x |--> 1/(x + 1)), (1/2, -2, x |--> -1/x), (1/2, 2/3, x |--> 1/(x + 1)), (1, -1, x |--> -1/x), (1, 1/2, x |--> 1/(x + 1)), (2, -1/2, x |--> -1/x), (2, 1/3, x |--> 1/(x + 1))]
```

which can be nicely converted to latex, while the new behavior gives

```
sage: G.edges()
[(1/4, -4, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac63a0>), (1/4, 4/5, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac6820>), (1/2, -2, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac63a0>), (1/2, 2/3, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac6820>), (1, -1, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac63a0>), (1, 1/2, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac6820>), (2, -1/2, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac63a0>), (2, 1/3, <function <lambda> at 0x174ac6820>)]
```

which can obviously not be nicely converted.

All other changes looks good to me.
