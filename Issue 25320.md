There were some minor typos in the module.rst file causing documentation build to fail.

There definitely needs to be some kind of documentation string with examples for the classes themselves. Right now if I try to do OscillatingTableau? or OscillatingTableaux? in command line, instead of getting information about what inputs I should be giving, what the objects look like, what rules there are for the objects, what are some sample objects I could create to use tab completion to see what methods are available etc., I just getting information about lazy_import.

There is a minor error in `OscillatingTableau.to_word`:
A minimal example is

```sage
sage: OscillatingTableau([[2,1],[2,2]]).to_word()
[1]
```

instead of

```sage
[2]
```


Here is a fix:

Next round of comments:

* documentation, Example: are things that are tested and shown to the user. Test: are things that are checked during doctests, but aren't shown to the user in documentation. So you want the code for promotion being the inverse of rotation to be in the example environment, and the various testsuites to be under a test environment.

* The convention for docstring phrasing is "Return a <blank>" instead of "Returns a <blank>".

* Phrasing of "This has vertices words of length r in this alphabet" is a little awkward. Maybe make it "The vertices are words of length r in this alphabet".

* Would it make sense to have a possible type of input be a partition shape, along with a word indicating which rows boxes are added/removed from? It seems a little asymmetric that most forms of input allow you to start from an arbitrary shape, but word input forces you to start from the empty shape.

* Docstring for `is_skew` should have the fancy quotes around True and False.

* `crossing_number` is missing a an empty line and EXAMPLE: between the docstring text and examples.

* `crossing_number` and `nesting number` should explain that it's coming from the associated matching. It's only mentioned under the `to_perfect_matching()` method that there's a bijection between the oscillating tableau that start/end at the empty shape and perfect matchings, and no mention of a relationship between arbitrary oscillating tableau and matchings.

* There should be some kind of definition for `descents`. Even though it's called 'references', as much as possible you really only want to use them as citations for accreditation, or as an additional reference for finer details/technicalities. Somebody reasonably familiar with the broader subject area should be able to read the docstring and understand what it does without needing to consult outside references.

* In `sundaram`, I don't know that 'straight oscillating tableau' is standard terminology, and it's never explicitly mentioned that 'straight oscillating tableau' means 'oscillating tableau that starts with the empty shape'. Also, the definition needs to be a little more precise, since 'complement' is ambiguous unless you specify a superset. I would also add an extra line of docstring as an extra paragraph mentioning how if you require the final shape to be empty, you get a bijection to perfect matchings (and include a link to `to_perfect_matching`).

* `to_perfect_matching` needs a little more in the docstring (and potentially link to `sundaram`), and should check that the final shape is empty, and return an error otherwise.

Replying to [comment:15 pfannerer]:
Fixed `OscillatingTableau.to_word` as proposed above.

Although this passes all tests there is still room for improvement. I have not been able to get ascii art or unicode art to work properly.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
