# Issue 17720: Pickling for morphisms of modules with basis

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17957

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2015-03-14 15:28:57

A few classes for morphisms of modules with basis don't pickle properly. See the comments close to the ``TestSuite`` calls in ``src/sage/modules/module_with_basis_morphism.py``.

This is a follow up to #8678.
