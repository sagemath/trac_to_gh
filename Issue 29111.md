# Issue 29111: Remove dependency on 'twisted' for some unpickling in cartan_type

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29348

Original creator: jhpalmieri

A function in `combinat/root_systems/cartan_type.py` uses Python's `twisted` package to do some unpickling. In #29320, we are making `twisted` optional, so we should remove its use from this file.

We can do this two ways: with #29320 as a dependency of this (my preference, since #29320 already has a positive review) or the other way around.

All it is is chnaging a test, not even the function itself. So no objections whatsoever.
