The following is unexpected:

```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('QQ^n * n^QQ', ZZ)
sage: (1/2)^n
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: 1/2 is not in Exact Term Monoid QQ^n * n^QQ
with coefficients in Integer Ring.
> *previous* ValueError: Factor 1/2 of 1/2 is neither
a coefficient (in Integer Ring) nor growth
(in Growth Group QQ^n * n^QQ).
sage: 1/2^n
(1/2)^n

The problem is that `(1/2)^n` calls `__pow__` of the rational `1/2`. This tries `A(1/2)^n`, which fails since `1/2` is not in `A`. This also explains why it works with coefficient ring `QQ` as in [comment:1 comment:1].

As a workaround you can use

```
sage: n.rpow(1/2)
```

I did some timings with mixed results:

1. `QQ^ZZ` became slower by a factor 1.4 (404ns to 575ns). This is because of the overhead of `IntegerPowAction` and it's really hard to avoid this slow-down. It's also a large relative slow-down because the actual powering is very fast.

2. The old code optimized the case of powering to a rational integer (an element of `QQ` with denominator 1). The new code doesn't, leading to a slow-down for `QQ^QQ` with integral exponent.

3. `QQ^QQ` is faster if the exponent is not a rational integer.

4. `ZZ^QQ` simply delegates to `QQ^QQ` (this code is not changed), so speed gains/losses are similar to the `QQ^QQ` case.

I'm not entirely sure whether I should implement a special case for powering to a rational integer. Is this case common enough to warrant the extra code?

I also noticed that #24500 gives an additional slight slow-down for `QQ^ZZ` (about 5%). This is because powering is always a right action, so the problem that #24500 fixes does not occur for `IntegerPowAction`.

More useful (if you want to do this optimization) would be to special-case integer powering in general in the coercion model.

sage: a = QQ(25); b = ZZ(2); timeit('a**b', repeat=20, number=100000)
100000 loops, best of 20: 479 ns per loop

I thought we already had some special casing for this with `IntegerPowAction`?

IMO, it is really easy to accidentally construct integers that are rational numbers, so that is why I think there is some merit to special casing that. However, I don't know how often this occurs in practice. My gut tells me that exponentiation of rationals is usually not a bottleneck in most computations, so I might be being too precious here.

No, we don't. It's just an ordinary action.

Sure, I'll do that.
