This is quite a project and looks good on a first lookover. Thank you for the contribution. I have some immediate questions/comments before delving too much into the code:

1. Could this be split up into smaller tickets? This would make the review much easier.
2. I think you could rename `finitely_presented_over_the_steenrod_algebra` to `fp_over_steenrod_algebra` in order to make the file paths shorter to type.
3. I think the module elements should be Cythonized as this is generally where the majority of the computations happen and it is good to be faster here.
4. Use the Sage default latex commands of `\ZZ`, `\GF{p}`, etc. so the documentation is standardized.
5. Check your use of `::` and `:`. If there is going to be a docstring after, then it should be `::`, otherwise it should be `:` (with exceptions for, e.g., `.. NOTE::`).
6. Errors should be of the form `raise TypeError("a message without a capital letter or period")` to follow Python's conventions. Also, you should not raise a `RuntimeError` unless you have a very good reason to; `NotImplementedError`, `TypeError`, and `ValueError` are usually much better.
7. I think it is better to have class level documentation explaining stuff about input, descriptive information, and use-case doctests. The `__init__` can then have a simple docstring with a test that basically does `TestSuite(foo).run()`. This is also a common pattern in Sage.

tscrim,

Thanks for the quick follow-up.  Here are some preliminary answers:

1. There are (essentially) three new classes introduced in this ticket: 
   a) free graded modules over F_p-algebras
   b) f.p. graded modules over F_p-algebras, and
   c) f.p. graded modules over the Steenrod algebra.

   The class structure is so that f.p. modules (b) have a morphism of free modules (a) as internal data to represent the finite presentation of itself, while a f.p. module over the Steenrod algebra (c) is derived from the class b).

   It would be possible to split the ticket into perhaps two or three tickets: either a), b) and c), or a)+b) and c).  The classes in (b) contain all the functionality which does not depend on features special for the Steenrod algebra.  Thus, they might be of more general interest.

   However, as they are written, classes a)+b) are privately used by c) and was not intended for public use (yet).  As a consequence, the examples and tests in a) + b) only consider modules over the Steenrod algebra.

3. Indeed there are performance bottlenecks here.  In particular, a lot of time is spent just creating instances of the free modules (class a mentioned above).  The current implementation was motivated by readability, and a performance optimization was planned as a second step.  Preliminary measurements indicate that even a Python version using tighter data structures would increase performance by x10 already.

   However -- we have not considered Cython because neither of us have used it before.  This may be the best option though, and I am looking into it now.  One concern I have is that we use derived classes (fpa modules are e.g. derived from fp modules).  Would this complicate using Cython, in your opinion?


Thanks for your input so far.  These are certainly valid points.  There should be an update addressing 2. 4. 5. 6. and 7. coming soon.

We have pushed updates to this package which addresses tscrim's above comments 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

With regards to comment 3, we have tried to use Cython to optimize certain parts of the package but without experiencing any significant speedups.  I commented earlier that
"Preliminary measurements indicate that even a Python version using tighter data structures would increase performance by x10 already."  Unfortunately, this comment was based on a too simple example (constructing a free module on one generator).  The performance tests we now have conducted are based on a real world use case which is much more relevant for the typical user.

We have therefore come to the conclusion that we want to keep the code as it is, all in Python.

We have conducted performance measurements of both the original Python code as well as a version of it using Cython.  Our analysis points to two facts:

1. There is virtually no difference in computing time when comparing our original all-Python code to a version where fp_element.py and free_element.py have been turned into .pyx-files and "cythonized".

2. Approximately 70% of the time used computing the resolution is spent in either the SteenrodAlgebra module or doing linear algebra (subspace spanning, vector space quotients, etc.)  These are modules that are external to our package, so Cythonizing our code will not have an effect on this chunk of time.  We stopped looking when we could account for 70%-80% of the time consumed, and we are certain that we are not spending the remaining time in a loop somewhere which can benefit from Cythonizing.  We imagine various memory allocations and overhead due to the dynamic nature of Python accounts for at  least some of the remaining 30%.

The code to reproduce these performance measurements is available in the
two experimental branches:

origin/u/gh-sverre320/fp_over_steenrod_algebra_cython_test

origin/u/gh-sverre320/fp_over_steenrod_algebra_performance_test

The first branch contains a version of our package where the two modules fp_element.py and free_element.py have been turned into .pyx-files and "cythonized".

Both branches contain a sage script called 'performance_test.sage' which run the same performance test.  It can be used like this:


```
> ./sage performance_test.sage
```



The test produces a CSV formatted output, and we have included the results from running it on our system to this comment.

Here's a quick explanation of their contents:

The output is CSV-formatted and measures how much time various parts of the code spends during the computation of one (homological) step of a certain free resolution.  This computation is done one (internal) degree at a time, and each line in the CSV file corresponds to a single degree.

Each row contains the following measurements:

"total time": This is the number of seconds it takes to complete one step of the free resolution in one homogeneous degree.

"accounted time": The number of seconds which are accounted for (We only measured the time spent in certain parts which we suspected were most time consuming).

"SteenrodAlgebra": The number of seconds spent calling the SteenrodAlgebra module.

"linear algebra": The number of seconds spent running external linear algebra code.

For each line, the two last values should add up to "accounted time" (or close to it.  We left out some more measurements which were tiny in comparison to the two already mentioned.)

The attached images visualize these data.

Sorry for the massive delay in getting back to this.

Thank you for looking into Cythonization. I would have thought there would be more of an advantage going to/from the linear algebra in Sage than dealing with the Steenrod algebra from a quick look through the code.

I have some quick comments before going into a deeper review:

It should be `INPUT:` and `OUTPUT:` with single quotes. If there is code afterwards (such as Sage doctests, which are indented one level), then it should be `EXAMPLES::` and `TESTS::`.

*Every* method needs a doctest. Good ones for `__init__` are to create an instance `foo` and run `TestSuite(foo).run()`.

The author bullet points should not be indented.

Input items should not end is a period/full-stop.

For `_richcmp_`, it is already guaranteed the elements have the same parent.

I would not do an import at the class level (see `from .fp_element import FP_Element`), but instead at the module level.

I would set `ModuleClass` and `HomSpaceClass` at the class level rather than during the `__init__`.

Do you want `j` to be a public attribute of `FP_Module`? If so (which I don't think is a good idea though), it needs a better name.

The name `FP_Module` doesn't follow Python naming conventions. Also, it is a bit too generic IMO.

You should add a method for creating the modules to the Steenrod algebra so it is both more discoverable and natural for the user.

I will likely have more comments later as I go deeper into the code.

>The name FP_Module doesn't follow Python naming conventions. Also, it is a bit too generic IMO. 
About the naming, we have struggled a bit in the past getting names for these classes.  They tend to grow rather long when we put in too many descriptive words.

But could this work?

FP_Module -> FinitelyPresentedModule

FPA_Module -> FinitelyPresentedSteenrodAlgebraModule

Personally, if we are to make the class names more descriptive, I would prefer to go all the way, like so:

FP_Module -> FinitelyPresentedModule

FPA_Module -> FinitelyPresentedModuleOverTheSteenrodAlgebra

Also, what about directory path names, does this mean that they have to grow too?

My current plan is the following, time-permitting:

- rewrite those files to base them on existing free module implementations.
- then see what's left after that.

I think this fits into tscrim's suggestion. Assuming there are no objections, then once I've made some progress, I will open a ticket for general finitely presented graded modules over graded rings, and we can rebase this ticket on top of that one.

Some people would insist that `Hom(M, N)` should contain only degree 0 maps; others (especially in algebraic topology, in my experience) allow maps of any degree. (Fortunately no one allows maps that do not preserve degrees, when considering categories of graded modules.) How do we handle this? Should there be two different structures, one for degree 0 maps, one for maps of arbitrary degree?

- first, in other parts of Sage that use gradings, the zero element has no degree, and in fact `zero.degree()` raises an error rather than returning `None` as it does here. So I am changing the behavior here to raise an error.

- I'm not sure what to do with homsets and morphisms. Some people would insist that `Hom(M, N)` should contain only degree 0 maps; others (especially in algebraic topology, in my experience) allow maps of any degree. (Fortunately no one allows maps that do not preserve degrees, when considering categories of graded modules.) How do we handle this? Should there be two different structures, one for degree 0 maps, one for maps of arbitrary degree? Or just degree 0 maps, and then people can consider `Hom(Sigma^i M, Sigma N)` if they want maps of degree `i` from `M` to `N`?

This may be more a question for Travis. Should the category be `GradedModules` or `GradedModulesWithBasis`? Maybe if we're working over an algebra with a distinguished basis, the module should inherit that basis, at least in the case of a free module. I'm not sure, though, and I really don't know what to do about non-free modules. (I haven't gotten that far in my modifications: I've just been dealing with free modules.)

I'm a little puzzled by the category setup in this context. Does "with basis" refer to a basis over the algebra over which we're working, or over the base field for that algebra? Consider this:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]                                                                       
sage: R                                                                                  
Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: M = FreeModule(R, ['a', 'b'])                                                      
sage: M.category()                                                                       
Category of finite dimensional modules with basis over Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
```

The "finite dimensional" part of that sounds odd unless you interpret it as meaning "free and finitely generated".

```
sage: M.basis()
Finite family {'a': B['a'], 'b': B['b']}
```

So this is viewing the basis as being over the polynomial ring.

On the other hand:

```
sage: A = GradedModulesWithBasis(QQ).example()                                           
sage: A                                                                                  
An example of a graded module with basis: the free module on partitions over Rational Field
sage: A.homogeneous_component_basis(4)                                                   
Lazy family (Term map from Partitions to An example of a graded module with basis: the free module on partitions over Rational Field(i))_{i in Partitions of the integer 4}
sage: list(A.homogeneous_component_basis(4))                                             
[P[4], P[3, 1], P[2, 2], P[2, 1, 1], P[1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

So `homogeneous_component_basis(...)` allows access to the vector space basis.

It looks like "with basis" means over the ring or algebra connected to the module, not the ground field. So maybe it should be in the categories
- `GradedModulesWithBasis(A)` only in the case of free modules
- `GradedModulesWithBasis(A.base_ring())` for all modules, assuming we can determine a basis of each homogeneous piece, and this should be possible as long as the algebra has a distinguished basis.
Does that make sense?

If Hom(M,N) is to contain morphisms of any degree, then it should be a graded vector space, and would not be of finite type, in general.  This suggests Hom(M,N) should contain morphisms of degree 0 only.

Counter-argument: a cochain representing an element of  Ext<sup>s,t</sup>(M,N) is a homomorphism of degree t from M _s (the s<sup>th</sup> stage in your free resolution of M) to N, or a homomorphism of degree 0 from M_s to \Sigma<sup>t</sup> N.   Then, lifting this to a chain map, you'll need degree 0 morphisms from M_{s+i} to \Sigma<sup>t</sup> N_i (where N_* is your resolution of N).

You end up needing to construct all (well, many of) the suspensions of every term in any resolution you create, which seems to be a lot of extra baggage.    Morphisms of any degree obviate this.

If you have morphisms of any degree, but Hom(M,N) only includes those of degree 0, where do the others live?

If there is a distinguished basis for the module, then `GradedModulesWithBasis`. Otherwise just `GradedModules`.

I would think that depends on the construction. However, having a distinguished basis means you can do linear algebra, which gives you a lot more functionality.

> I'm not sure, though, and I really don't know what to do about non-free modules. (I haven't gotten that far in my modifications: I've just been dealing with free modules.)

Since we don't have much if any support for nonfree modules in Sage, you are out there on your own to figure out what the best practice should be.

Perhaps it would be a bit better to call it the category of "finite rank free modules", but that is something you are best discussing with Nicholas about.

Agreed.

Yes, that is correct, it is the base ring `R`, not any underlying ground ring/field that might be used to construct `R`.

This sounds like more of a question with the underlying mathematics that I can't answer.

I don't think there is anything wrong with having an artificial name for the basis elements. This is just implicit in Sage's `R^n` version of free modules, but we give a name to the basis all the time in math once we want to start working with a basis. However, using CFM is generally slower because its implementation is in Python, always sparse, and has some extra overhead because it allows more generic basis indices.

Let `S` be the Steenrod algebra over a (commutative) ring `R`. Perhaps we should think of the free module as a representation of `S` over `R`, something you alluded to in your other comments. Internally, this seems to be how it is storing elements, as an infinite dimensional `R`-module

(There are others which fail because `res` is not defined after line 540 fails.)

The first failure is definitely because of the issue I mentioned above: the code should auto-detect an appropriate finite-dimensional algebra to work over, in which case we should not have to specify a top dimension, but clearly something is going wrong. I think that one of the morphisms is in the class `FPMorphism` rather than the Steenrod-specific `FPA_Morphism`. An example:

```
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.steenrod.module import FPA_Module
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra()
sage: Hko = FPA_Module(A, [0], [[Sq(2)], [Sq(1)]])
sage: gen = Hko.generator(0)
sage: homspace = Hom(Hko, Hko)
sage: values = [Sq(0, 0, 1)*gen]
sage: f = homspace(values)

sage:  # Good so far:

sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.modules.fp_graded.steenrod.homspace.FPA_ModuleHomspace_with_category_with_equality_by_id.element_class'>
sage: k = f.kernel_inclusion()
sage: type(k)
<class 'sage.modules.fp_graded.steenrod.homspace.FPA_ModuleHomspace_with_category_with_equality_by_id.element_class'>
sage: coker = k.cokernel_projection()
sage: type(coker)
<class 'sage.modules.fp_graded.steenrod.homspace.FPA_ModuleHomspace_with_category_with_equality_by_id.element_class'>

sage: # But this is a problem:

sage: type(coker.codomain())
<class 'sage.modules.fp_graded.module.FPModule_with_category'>
```

It should be `FPA_Module_with_category`. I don't know why this codomain is not in the right class.

Okay, I found a bug and fixed it, and that took care of most of the problems. Something like the first issue I mentioned is still occurring: I don't know how to naturally force a morphism to be in the right class. The remaining failure comes from this doctest:

```
    sage: def is_exact(res):
    ....:     for i in range(len(res)-1):
    ....:         h = res[i].homology(res[i+1])
    ....:         if not h.codomain().is_trivial():
    ....:             return False
    ....:     return True

    sage: is_exact(res)
    True
```

The problem is that the maps in `res` are maps of `FreeGradedModules`, so they are not in the Steenrod-specific world, so the `homology` computation doesn't work.

-----

In case you're interested, the bug is a subtle one in the code from #32505: to compute the coefficients of an element in a free module, we were using

```
        return self.dense_coefficient_list()
```

but the default ordering for the coefficients is in increasing order of degree, not the specified order for the generators. We were hitting a situation in which this mattered, and changing to this fixed it:

```
        order = self.parent()._indices
        return self.dense_coefficient_list(order)
```

I will add some doctests that capture this.

I wonder if there is some simple modification to the code for `resolution` for Steenrod algebra modules:

```python
    def resolution(self, k, top_dim=None, verbose=False):
        """
        (documentation omitted)
        """
        algebra = self.base_ring()
        finite_algebra = SteenrodAlgebra_generic(algebra.prime(), profile=self.profile())

        # Change rings to the finite algebra, and call the base class
        # implementation of this function.
        res = FPModule.resolution(
            self.change_ring(finite_algebra),
            k,
            top_dim=top_dim,
            verbose=verbose)

        # Change rings back to the original Steenrod algebra.
        return [j.change_ring(self.base_ring()) for j in res]
```

Something at the end that does more than just change the ring, but also forces the morphism to have the right class. This code explicitly calls `FPModule.resolution`, and that's probably the root of the problem. We could completely duplicate the general resolution code to the Steenrod algebra setting, but there must be a better way.

By the way, although `A` is a standard thing for homotopy theorists to call the Steenrod algebra, `FPA_Module` is not the most evocative name, I think. `SteenrodModule`? `SteenrodFPModule`? What should we call the class? (Have to get a jump on the bike-shedding.)

> I am quite surprised by this bug and slightly worried because it should not matter about the order (as long as internally each class knows how to go back and forth between consistently).

Indeed, my "fix" has broken something. This works:

```
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.free_module import FreeGradedModule
sage: F.<x,y> = FreeGradedModule(A, (2, 0))
sage: x.degree()
2
sage: y.degree()
0
```

This doesn't:

```
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.module import FPModule
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra()
sage: M.<x,y> = FPModule(A, (2, 0))
sage: x.degree()
0
sage: y.degree()
2
```

To compute the degree of an element of an `FPModule`, it first computes a lift to a free module and then computes the degree there, but when computing that lift, it mixes up the order of the generators.

```
sage: x.lift_to_free()
y
```

This is somehow due to imposing the order in `coefficients`.

Thank you.

Okay, so I have two ways out of this issue of not having the correct class specified when building, e.g., the resolution:

1. We introduce a method, say, `_graded_module_class()` (that takes a parameter `free`) that returns the corresponding class.
2. We use `type(self.codomain())` and attach, via an attribute, the free module class to each FP module.

I am maybe slightly preferential towards 2 since it is local to the module implementation (which is what needs this information) rather than more global to the algebras. We might have some consistency issues to address (such as the free modules not taking a morphism as defining information), but these will likely improve the overall quality and robustness of the code.

Actually, in comment:76, we already basically have 1. with the `free_graded_module()` method to the `base_ring()`. We might want to actually use that instead in `resolution()`.

Whether they are an instance of `FPModule` or `FreeGradedModule`, the print representation could be the same.

Both of those are fine with me, but it could make it harder to detect incompatibilities between the objects as we would need to look at the `type` rather than the printing output. Although I don't think the particular repr output for the resolution is so important though since it is just updating some doctests.

Making the `FPModule` return the corresponding free module when it has no relations has been great for finding bugs and incompatibilities between the two objects. Right now I am at figuring this one out:

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: F = A.free_graded_module([0])
sage: G = A.free_graded_module([-1])
sage: H = Hom(G, F)
sage: H._basis_elements(0, False)
Module morphism:
  From: Free graded left module on 1 generator over mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
  To:   Free graded left module on 1 generator over mod 2 Steenrod algebra, milnor basis
  Defn: g[-1] |--> 0
```

The exterior algebra has the same behavior:

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: F = E.free_graded_module([0])
sage: G = E.free_graded_module([-1])
sage: H = Hom(G, F)
sage: H._basis_elements(0, True)
[Module morphism:
   From: Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 3 over Rational Field
   To:   Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 3 over Rational Field
   Defn: g[-1] |--> 0]
sage: H._basis_elements(1, False)
Module morphism:
  From: Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 3 over Rational Field
  To:   Free graded left module on 1 generator over The exterior algebra of rank 3 over Rational Field
  Defn: g[-1] |--> 0
sage: H._basis_elements(1, True)
/home/travis/sage-build/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/modules/free_module.py:236: UserWarning: You are constructing a free module
over a noncommutative ring. Sage does not have a concept
of left/right and both sided modules, so be careful.
It's also not guaranteed that all multiplications are
done from the right side.
  warn("""You are constructing a free module
```

The last computation finished quite quickly for `A` but the last one didn't finish within 1 minute on my laptop (and `E` is an 8 dimensional skew-commutative algebra!). My guess is this is accidentally passing the algebra somehow rather than the underlying scalar ring for the algebra, which is why we get the warning.

I suspect the fix to the first bug is simply checking if the corresponding morphism is the zero morphism or not.

I also removed the `_repr_` as I think it is useful to distinguish when someone has passed something that is secretly free but is not such a class. This is was useful for me to tell when  was `Hom` not being an endomorphism space despite the output suggesting it was. Since basically all things that are free will be a `FreeGradedModule` (or a subclass), I think this will obtain the print representation you wanted.

There are also a few other tests failing that I don't yet know why.

I am going to get lunch now and do a little bit of other work. I will return to this later today.

```

I traced the problem down to this difference in behaviour:

```
sage: F = FPModule(A, [0], [[]])
sage: Gp = FPModule(A, [-1], [[0]])
sage: Fp = FPModule(A, [0], [[]])
sage: F = E.free_graded_module([0])
sage: G = E.free_graded_module([-1])

sage: F[G.gen(0).degree() + 0]
Vector space of dimension 0 over Rational Field
sage: Fp[Gp.gen(0).degree() + 0]
()
```

So I can fix the symptom easily enough by not using `__getitem__` in the code (which I think is better anyways for the explicitness). However, we should (quickly) decide which behavior we want and change one of these.

I agree that we should avoid using `__getitem__` in the code. I think if `__getitem__(n)` should mean anything, then it should mean the `n`th homogeneous piece as a vector space rather than a basis (is that what it's doing?) for that space.

Re your comment "FIXME: Do not rely on this behavior!" in profile.py: why not? It is documented Python behavior.

I have fixed a the `__getitem__` and a number of other compatibility issues (such as not passing `top_dim` along). There are still the following:

- The `FIXME`/`TODO` I have marked.
- Returning a free module once we remove all trivial relations. This will likely require us to update some doctests.
- Some trivial output difference because of the new Steenrod modules and verbose output. Likely we will just update the output, but I wanted to see if we wanted to actually change the objects we are testing.
- Go over the entire documentation to look for other ways to improve it.
- Fixing the comment:90 bug.

With regards to the comment:90 bug, it is deeper than the Steenrod algebra:

I am not sure how to make this smaller. Yet at least it is likely more "simple" because it for an infinite commutative graded algebra of characteristic 0 and exists without this new specific code.

Here is my proposal for the documentation: To move the (very nice) explanation of the modules to its own thematic tutorial. Since it is more of a walkthrough of the capabilities of the code and longer, I felt this was a more natural place for it. In part because the best title I could come up with for that section was "tutorial."

For the `#FIXME` in the `cokernel_projection`, I was thinking the morphism that was being created was basically the one defining the cokernel. However this is not the case when the domain is not a free module. So I removed this.

For GCAs, those are not in `GradedModulesWithBasis`, so it is not so surprising to me they do not work. That being said, they are implemented essentially with a distinguished basis and are already basically in this category. (I have the same gripe about polynomial rings too.) Thus, it should be easy enough to make them work. Another thing I would like to do is rewrite it without using plural, which would likely make it a bit easier to put it in `GradedModulesWithBasis`.

I tweaked the `profile()` to avoid going through a `dict`, so it should be faster (not that it was necessarily a bottleneck before).

I renamed `min_presentation()` to `minimal_presentation()` to be more explicit. I don't think we need to deprecate it since this should be merged before the next release. We can setup an (deprecated) alias if we want too.

All that is left is the `_resolve_kernel` bug I believe (assuming my changes are good).

Thank you for figuring out the issue.

Using the example in `element_from_coordinates`

```
sage: A = SteenrodAlgebra(2)
sage: from sage.modules.fp_graded.steenrod.module import SteenrodFPModule
sage: rels = [[Sq(1),0,0,0], [Sq(2),0,0,0], [Sq(4),0,0,0], [Sq(8),0,0,0],

sage: M = SteenrodFPModule(A, [0, 17, 42, 71], relations=rels)
sage: %prun res = M.resolution(2, top_dim=30, verbose=True)
```

the changes I just pushed make the time go from ~38s to ~17s on my laptop. From my understanding, a chokepoint is converting to/from dense vectors. This now once-and-forever fixes a number of basis orders.

Hopefully nothing fundamentally relies on the underlying algebra being a `CFM` (just in the category of `GradedModulesWithBasis`). If we encounter issues as we add further algebras, mainly CGAs, then we can make fixes here as necessary IMO.

We can re-enable the caching on the higher level method of `basis_element()`, but I don't think it is called frequently enough to warrant the caching.

I made a new ticket for a bug in partitions #33323 that was exposed by this change.

Doctests now fully pass for me. So I am ready to set a positive review if you agree with my latest push.

If they haven't read the documentation on this method, they aren't going to read the warning. I think you are also relying on undocumented behavior that could change at any time.

Since we are explicitly passing the `order` and the method's API specifies a particular behavior for this, any subtle problem is definitely an honest bug in the result of `super().dense_coefficient_list()`.

I added a check to `_monomial`. My earlier point is that once they see the error, then they will look at the documentation and may not still realize the problem, until they remember/realize that "indices" doesn't just mean 0, 1, 2, .... Now it should be better because we will just raise an error.

Indeed!

I am very happy this code finally seems to be in the right place with regards to the rest of Sage.  In particular, it's great that FPModules can be created over other algebras than the Steenrod algebra!  

I ran some tests today, comparing the performance of the code we submitted for review with the current version:  Computing the free resolution of the module M = A/(Sq^12, Sq^7) (A = the mod 2 Steenrod algebra) is 3x faster now!  In my example, I computed the length 3 resolution which took ~303 seconds before, and ~106 seconds now, on my laptop.  I ran similar tests with other modules, with consistent conclusions.
