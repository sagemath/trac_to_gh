# Issue 16781: Polishing documentation of posets

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  ncohen

There are some minor issues in documentation at `posets.py`. "Returns" should be "return", join_matrix() is not on it's place on alphabetical list, one line descriptions of is_xx() -functions use varying phrasing, link to is_lattice() is missing...

But more: Should list of functions be re-arranged by topic (instead of just one big list) like for example graphs already has? If this is desired, I may do this.

+1 for a thematic index.

Nathann, any comments on grouping of functions?


---

Comment by ncohen created at 2015-05-13 06:31:34

Not really, that's already better than what we have, and we can still change it later. Maybe some additional category for 'polynomials', `linear extensions` and `intervals` ?


---

Comment by jmantysalo created at 2015-05-21 18:30:46

I suggest that we make this change now. It is then easier to go throught function list and check smaller things one by one.

The following functions are missing from the index:


```
> canonical_label
> interval
> is_chain_of_poset
```


Also, some lines of the index contain broken sentences (e.g. `open_interval`) or definitions that do not belong there (e.g. `lower_covers`). That makes the lines rather long: could you shortent them?

Thanks,

Nathann

Replying to [comment:7 ncohen]:

> The following functions are missing from the index:

Duh, I added `characteristic_polynomial` but did not see `canonical_label` nor `is_chain_of_poset` which were also missing from index. I drop `interval` intentionally, because it is just an alias for `closed_interval`.

> Also, some lines of the index contain broken sentences (e.g. `open_interval`) or definitions that do not belong there (e.g. `lower_covers`). That makes the lines rather long: could you shortent them?

I'll take a look. But I'm quite sure that there will be more to polish even after this round.

Btw, should "Return *a* list of the maximal elements of the poset." be "Return *the* list of the maximal elements of the poset."? Never sure about this a/an vs. the -thing.

Yo !

> Duh, I added `characteristic_polynomial` but did not see `canonical_label` nor `is_chain_of_poset` which were also missing from index.

I did it old-style. Wrote the two lists in two files, and compared them.

> I drop `interval` intentionally, because it is just an alias for `closed_interval`.

Okayokay..

> I'll take a look. But I'm quite sure that there will be more to polish even after this round.

Yeah sure sure.

> Btw, should "Return *a* list of the maximal elements of the poset." be "Return *the* list of the maximal elements of the poset."? Never sure about this a/an vs. the -thing.

I would expect "the", because that set is unique. The list is not really unique, as it is ordered, but well.. I expect that everybody expects "the" there.

Round 2. Thanks Nathann.

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-05-22 09:50:04

I would put `intervals_number` with the other interval methods

Maybe 2 new sections `Graphs and digraphs` and `Matrices` ?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-05-22 09:51:57

:meth:`~FinitePoset.completion_by_cuts`  should go into `New posets from old ones`

Replying to [comment:12 chapoton]:

> I would put `intervals_number` with the other interval methods

No, it is a property of the whole poset just like `cardinality`.

> Maybe 2 new sections `Graphs and digraphs` and `Matrices` ?

Maybe. I must think this later.

Replying to [comment:13 chapoton]:
> :meth:`~FinitePoset.completion_by_cuts`  should go into `New posets from old ones` 

True. I also moved `connected_components()` to that part.

I agree to put `intervals_number` in the properties.

OK. I think that this one is ready for review. It will need rebasing if someone happens to add a function to poset class; hence it is easier to get this done now, and then gradually check function descriptions etc.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-05-22 11:51:19

Please put intervals_number in the properties, and I will give a pos.rev.


---

Comment by jmantysalo created at 2015-05-22 11:58:22

Ah, now I see. There is already `relations_number`. What if I remove aliases from the function list? They would still be on the page, but not on TOC by topic.

(I did it to `interval` already.


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2015-05-22 12:03:44

Well, ok for removing the aliases from the toc.

Removed. (What names should be left, that I'm not sure of. But at least this is good start.)

ok, let us do that.
