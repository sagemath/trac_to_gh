Implement the fast shifting algorithm for connectivity. 
It include a fast algorithm for both 3 and 4-connectivity. (the algorithms also works for higher connectivity, but not as fast.)

The following two papers contain the idea of the algorithm:

Something fishy is going on with the commits. When I click the green link above, it looks like the branch is removing all of the contents of matroid.pyx. The "git trac try" command seems to work fine, so I don't quite know what's going on here.

One thing that definitely needs fixing is that some makefiles get added by mistake.

Some more questions / issues:

* the shifting algorithm is not mentioned as an option in the is_3connected docstring
* the _is_3connected_shifting docstring mistakenly has a 4 in its first line
* there is no user-facing is_4connected that can benefit from the shifting algorithm.

I made a new merge, that strange problem seems to go away.

Fixed other problems.

I'm happy with this code now. Positive review from me.
