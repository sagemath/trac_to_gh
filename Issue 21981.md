the subject says it all; `csdp` is a Sage package that can provide a more efficient than `cvxopt` backend. Also, another solver that 
can be hooked up is [DSDP](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/hs/software/DSDP/), 
which has a licence that makes it possible to bundle it with Sage.

Moreover, `DSDP` may be interfaced via `cvxopt`, so thi should be very easy indeed.

All of these (as well as `cvxopt`) backends would have a precision limitation coming from the fact that they all work with `RDF` numbers. Implementing a robust (in the sense of precision) SDP solver is doable, but the precision has to be controlled, as explained in [de Klerk & Vallentin (2016)](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/15M103114X).
