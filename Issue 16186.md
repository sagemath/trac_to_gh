# Issue 16186: Table of MOLS from the handbook and comparison with Sage

Issue created by migration from Trac.

With this branch we have a `MOLS_table` function which displays what Sage can handle, and also compare it with what the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs (2ed) claims.

We seem to be rather far but I have several construction that somehow make the gap smaller. But there is a lot to review already `:-P`

Indeed, a lot of minus... but at least two pluses!

Don't worry about the minuses... They are an endangered species.

Hi Nathann,

In u/vdelecroix/16423 I simplified some of the string formatting and aligned the Handbook table. If you are happy with it, set to positive review.

I align a part of the alignment. Aaaaaaaaand set the ticket to positive review hoping that you will have nothing against it `:-P`

Nathan

P.S. : and now that this branch is positvely reviewed I will have to rebase all other branches above it, as they will all conflict with the new MOLS table.....

Merged with #16347. Here is the new table of differences (without the construction that are still on my computer only)

Hi,

I did the rebase over #16347 at `public/16423`. It looks good to me, just do a double check.

There are two commits containing  Wilson's construction with two truncated groups in your branch

If you don't mind, I will cherry-pick the commits from the current branch on top of #16347.
