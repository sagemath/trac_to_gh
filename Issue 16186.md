With this branch we have a `MOLS_table` function which displays what Sage can handle, and also compare it with what the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs (2ed) claims.

We seem to be rather far but I have several construction that somehow make the gap smaller. But there is a lot to review already `:-P`

Hi Nathann,

In u/vdelecroix/16423 I simplified some of the string formatting and aligned the Handbook table. If you are happy with it, set to positive review.

I align a part of the alignment. Aaaaaaaaand set the ticket to positive review hoping that you will have nothing against it `:-P`

P.S. : and now that this branch is positvely reviewed I will have to rebase all other branches above it, as they will all conflict with the new MOLS table.....
