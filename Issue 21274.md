Keywords: sage_location, sagelib

sage_location is falling on our feet in #15105.

it does something related to copy or move a sage-the-distribution "installation".

however, it is currently part of sagelib, where it will be never needed, even more (less) so after sagelib has become a standard package. it should be moved to sage-the-distribution, i.e. out of `src`.

maybe theres a workaround for this...?
