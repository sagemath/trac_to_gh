# Issue 21983: Remove instance of SAGE_SRC from sage runtime introduced by #20745

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22220

Original creator: fbissey

Original creation time: 2017-01-21 08:43:25

Ticket #20745 introduced instances of `SAGE_SRC` to be used at runtime in `sage/homology/simplicial_set_examples.py`. The data that is queried is properly installed in `SAGE_EXTCODE` so that doesn't need to be corrected. as well.

This is of course a no-no especially for sage-on-distro.
