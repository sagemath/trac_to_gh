Best to switch to the (multi)linear algebra that comes from sage-manifolds.

```
            sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(ZZ, 3, name='M')
            sage: e = M.basis('e')
            sage: a = M.linear_form('A') ; a
            Linear form A on the Rank-3 free module M over the Integer Ring
            sage: a[:] = [2,-1,3]  # components w.r.t. the module's default basis (e)
            sage: a.display()
