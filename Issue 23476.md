The number of files that the parallel map/reduce doctests requires is `O(N)` where `N` is the number of processors, while the number of open files allowed is typically `O(1)`. So, on a machine with 192 processors:

A simple solution would be to restrict the number of processors while doctesting.

Hi Jeroen, 

Thanks for taking care of this one (and all the others) ! It's good to go for me. I assume that the limit `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=2` si set up to be able to doctests on small machines. It seems a little low to me. I'd rather put 4 just to shake up a little the parallel feature. Except for that, everything loos ok to me.
