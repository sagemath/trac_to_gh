Keywords: destdir flint arb

This is implementing #24024 for the flint and arb packages which use basically the same "build system".  

This shouldn't change much anything in the end result of installing these packages, but I bumped the version numbers just to ensure testing on the buildbots.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25035
