# Issue 24798: Use sage-dist-helpers + add DESTDIR support for flint and arb

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-03-27 09:24:13

Keywords: destdir flint arb

This is implementing #24024 for the flint and arb packages which use basically the same "build system".  

This shouldn't change much anything in the end result of installing these packages, but I bumped the version numbers just to ensure testing on the buildbots.

Two of the failing patchbots seem to be...really broken, and in different ways.  I don't think it has anything directly to do with this ticket...

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).

Cool. I don't know why this one keeps getting delayed.  It's pretty straightforward.  Frédéric, now that you have some experience with this on plantri perhaps you can look at it after I rebase again.  It's really straightforward.

Hence "after I rebase again", which is to say "when it is done" and not "I have done it".

Thanks!  I'm still re-testing this but I don't anticipate any problems.
