# Issue 18887: Curves in differentiable manifolds

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: differentiable manifold, curve, interval, real line

This ticket implements differentiable curves in real differentiable manifolds. This is a follow-up of #19092 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview). 

This ticket implements the following Python classes:
- the parent class `OpenInterval` for open intervals of *R* as 1-dimensional diff. manifolds
  with a canonical chart, 
  - the subclass `RealLine` for *R* as a 1-dimensional diff. manifolds
- the parent class `DiffManifoldCurveSet` for homsets Hom(I,M), i.e. sets of differentiable maps
  I --> M, where I is an open interval of *R* and M a differentiable manifold over *R*
- the element class `DiffManifoldCurve` for curves, i.e. differentiable maps I --> M

Same things as on #19092. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

Thank you very much again for this review and the changes!

In the last commits, I've updated to the latest version of #19092 and have added the display of a 3D example in the documentation of `DifferentiableCurve.plot`. I am also changing the dependency to #20771, which itself depends on #19092.

I've just noticed that the LaTeX rendering of `RealLine` in Jupyter notebooks was not correct. It was using `\RR`, which worked fine in Sage legacy notebook, but is displayed as a red "\RR" in the Jupyter notebook (when using `%display latex`). The above commit changes the default LaTeX name to `\Bold{R}`, which is what is used by other Sage objects representing the real numbers: `RR` and `RDF`. It works fine with both the Jupyter notebook and the legacy notebook. Do you agree?

PS: an alternative would be to use `\mathbb{R}`, which is correctly rendered in both notebooks.

I think we should be consistent with the rest of Sage, so I agree with `\Bold{R}`.
