FWIW, same happens with Sage 5.0... ;-)

Changing keywords from "" to "PARI".

But:

```
$ ../sage-4.7.2/sage 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]
sage: sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: sage: f=x^6 + (t^8 + t + 1)*x + t^6 + t^5 + t^3 + t
sage: sage: f.discriminant()
t^48 + t^36 + t^24 + 1
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.20s, Wall time 0m30.96s).

$ ../sage-4.8/sage 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]
sage: sage: S.<x> = R[]

Changing status from new to needs_info.

And in 5.11.beta3 (note the different answer):

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=x^6 + (t^8 + t + 1)*x + t^6 + t^5 + t^3 + t
sage: f.discriminant()
t^48 + t^34 + t^32 + t^20 + t^16 + t^6 + t^4 + t^2 + 1
sage: 
Exiting Sage (CPU time 0m0.12s, Wall time 0m40.61s).
```

Perhaps this was fixed by #13672?

already in Sage 5.9, we get:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage: R.<t> = GF(2)[]
sage: S.<x> = R[]
sage: f=x^6 + (t^8 + t + 1)*x + t^6 + t^5 + t^3 + t
sage: f.discriminant()
t^48 + t^34 + t^32 + t^20 + t^16 + t^6 + t^4 + t^2 + 1
```

which is the correct result. I thus propose to close that ticket.

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Setting milestone to sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix and giving a positive review; is the correct way to indicate that it should be closed?
