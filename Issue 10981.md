#4434 should be backed out and fixed (if even still necessary) in a more modern fashion. In the newer versions of Mercurial currently shipped with sage, hgmerge is obsolete (and in fact has been since 1.0, which might explain why no script at all was being copied over, as mentioned in the description of #4434). It's not a good idea to rely on outdated functionality.

See http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/hgmerge :

>Before Mercurial 1.0, a script named hgmerge was installed by default. As of Mercurial 1.0, hgmerge is no longer installed (and it should not be distributed with Mercurial), but hg still uses it, if it's present on the system and no other merge tools are configured. See [MergeToolConfiguration](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MergeToolConfiguration) for the new mechanism.

Hopefully removing this hgmerge file will simply work on OS X - otherwise, a solution should be made using hgrc as described at [MergeToolConfiguration](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MergeToolConfiguration).

hmm, how does one check that removing hgmerge does not break things?
reading #4434 says it's about a 3-way graphical thing, of which I am clueless...

As we talked about in person, I guess the way to test it would be to try using `sage -hg` to merge files which cannot be automatically merged. I created [this minimal example of such a repository and such a file](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/keshav/temp/hgmerge-test/), which you then pulled and tried out, using `sage -hg` with `$SAGE_ROOT/bin/hgmerge` removed. This worked just as well as it works on my Linux machine:


```
keshav@esterhazy ~/temp/hgmerge-test $ sage -hg log --style=compact

```


Note that this is not really an *error* - it's just the lack of a default merge program being installed. Could it be possible that the problem that occasioned #4474 is present on Linux as well?

There is actually a sort of "merge tool autodect script" (actually just some configuration entries making mercurial smarter about where to find a range of common merging tools) which is provided but not installed by the upstream distribution of Mercurial, and which lies in the file `src/contrib/mergetools.rc` within the spkg's root directory. Putting this in `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/` should cause merge program problems to go away. I'll write a patch...

why do I see fuzz? I'm applying it to the mercurial spkg that comes with sage- 4.7.alpha3

As well, it seems that your patch either wasn't tested, or was tested against a diffrent spkg. Indeed, I get:

`hgmerge` remaining in SAGE_LOCAL/bin is not a problem; `mergetools.rc` overrides it. I guess the best way to test this is to try to replicate #4434 with the new spkg installed - it should be impossible.

would be good to state clearly in the ticket description  which patches should be applied, and which should not be applied.
I.e, is trac_11120-re-fix-trac_4434.mercurial-spkg.patch needed?
