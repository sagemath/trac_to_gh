# Issue 27740: Py3: Fix crystals.kirillov_reshetikhin for python3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27977

Use a collections.OrderedDict as return for the method `KR_type_E7._highest_weight_to_A7_elements`. That way the object we pass to crystal `crystal_morphism` will be iterated in the same order in python2 and python3.

Note that `from_A7_crystal` call `sorted` two times. 

If there is high performances expectations with these function, it might be best to juste tag the doctests with #py2 / #py3.

IMO, it is bad form to change (non print output) code so doctests are sorted. Instead you should just `sorted(K._highest_weight_to_A7_elements.items())` and do the following change to `CrystalMorphismByGenerators` (in `categories/crystals.py`):

```diff
         if gens is None:
             if isinstance(on_gens, dict):
-                gens = on_gens.keys()
+                gens = sorted(on_gens)
             else:
                 gens = parent.domain().module_generators
         self._gens = tuple(gens)
```

Ok thanks for your comments.

Your solution doesn't solve the case with `from_A7_crystal`, it looks likes one difference is that `gens` is not `None` when `CrystalMorphismByGenreators.__init__` is called. I am currently searching why this difference.

It's not clear to me why sorting at `CrystalMorphismByGenerators` level is cleaner than doing it at `KR_type_E7 level`. Can you expand on that please ?

My initial reasoning was that as it is a `KR_type_E7` specific problem the fix should not impact other classes.

Here is another proposal with fixes at `CrystalMorphismByGenerators` level.

Sorry for the noise

Ah, right. I misread it as `gens is not None`. `^^;;` Actually, it really is just an output issue. This has zero impact on the code working (at least, it should otherwise I would suspect a bug).

It is not specific to that. It just happens to be that this case constructs the morphism using a (complicated enough) `dict` and this is not done elsewhere in any doctest. So this would cause an output difference in those doctests.

I am still not 100% happy with the change I proposed as it is essentially an unnecessary sort. However, I understand why you would do this for compatibility, and I doubt anyone is doing something with this where that would become a performance bottleneck. Well, this will now work (although we could force the sorting, but that would likely trivially break a bunch of other doctests):

```diff
         if gens is None:
             if isinstance(on_gens, dict):
-                gens = on_gens.keys()
+                gens = on_gens
             else:
                 gens = parent.domain().module_generators
+        if isinstance(gens, dict):
+            gens = sorted(gens)
         self._gens = tuple(gens)
```

I am definitely in favor of just changing the doctest to have `...` for the images of the generators for the morphism.

You just beat me to it. I still think it would be good to remove that useless call to `keys()` in the `if gens is None:` block, but if you don't want to do that, then you can set a positive review.

Comment by vklein created at 2019-06-13 14:48:25

Well the current branch doesn't have side effects on others doctests under combinat/crystals from the tests i have done.

To be accurate you're fine with this solution (minus the `keys()` call) but you prefer to just use `...` in doctests ?

I think you are right using `...` may be the cleaner solution here. 

Third branch has been pushed.

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-06-13 15:16:06

Thank you. The doctest is really just about showing the morphism exists, the actual definition is tested through other means.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were _actually_ included, especially when closing tickets.
