# Issue 12765: sqlite sometimes picks up the wrong libraries (e.g., readline) since we forgot to set LDFLAGS

Issue created by migration from Trac.

On certain systems, e.g., Fedora with libreadline.so.5 systemwide, when building
sqlite, the sqlite3 binary points to libreadline.so.5.  However, Sage ships libreadline.so.6.  The fix is trivial -- just define LDFLAGS, as we always should do.  (Why we don't in ./install is beyond me...)

Diff for the sqlite spkg. For reference / review only.

Obviously, `-I $SAGE_LOCAL/lib` should be `-L $SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.  This couldn't have solved any problem.
