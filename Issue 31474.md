Keywords: consistency

The `roots` method for the zero polynomial behaves
very differently depending on the base ring.

In some cases it returns an empty list, in other cases
error messages of various kinds:

```
sage: GF(3)['x'].zero().roots()
[]
sage: SR['x'].zero().roots()
[]
sage: QQ['x'].zero().roots()
...
ArithmeticError: factorization of 0 is not defined
sage: RR['x'].zero().roots()
...
PariError: zero polynomial in roots
```

```

Roots of a polynomial (in its base ring or a ring containing it)
are elements where the polynomial evaluates to zero; all elements
of the considered ring are roots of the zero polynomial.

One consistency option would be to raise a `NotImplementedError`
regardless of the base ring.
