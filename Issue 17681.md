# Issue 17681: Clean up src/sage/.gitignore and src/Makefile

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17918

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-03-09 14:14:08

Since we no longer compile inside `src/sage`, we can remove `src/sage/.gitignore` and most of `src/Makefile`.
