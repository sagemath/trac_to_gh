Pillow now aborts if you don't have libjpeg-devel

```
ValueError: jpeg is required unless explicitly disabled using --disable-jpeg, aborting
Error building / installing Pillow
```

That's a bit massive. I can confirm some of them but not all of them. But it looks like you only found stuff about `networkx` and `pillow` so far. #19988 is the only other thing I know where there is an issue. 
No one on the gentoo unstable tree currently complains, but `ptyprocess-0.5.1` is not in the tree, it's the only thing there on which I wouldn't know anything one way or the other.

Looks like a new dependency for pyparsing:

```
ImportError: No module named setuptools
Error installing pyparsing ... exiting
```

Hum... Looking at gentoo ebuilds I see some extra dependencies for `jsonschema`: `rfc3986`, `strict-rfc3339` and `webcolors`. Those are runtime dependencies so may be it works without. That's all I can spot apart from indeed that `pyparsing` now depends on `setuptools`.
