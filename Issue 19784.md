That's a bit massive. I can confirm some of them but not all of them. But it looks like you only found stuff about `networkx` and `pillow` so far. #19988 is the only other thing I know where there is an issue. 
No one on the gentoo unstable tree currently complains, but `ptyprocess-0.5.1` is not in the tree, it's the only thing there on which I wouldn't know anything one way or the other.
