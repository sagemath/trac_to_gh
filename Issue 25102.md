# Issue 25102: lift_morphism for Exterior algebra does not know it is a morphism of finite-dimensional algebras

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25339

Original creator: tscrim

CC:  darij chapoton

Keywords: exterior algebra


```
sage: E = ExteriorAlgebra(ZZ, 'e', 5)
sage: phi = E.lift_morphism(identity_matrix(5))
sage: phi.category_for()
Category of super algebras with basis over Integer Ring
```

The result should know it is for finite-dimensional algebras (which gives it extra methods).

Relatively simple fix; always good to be explicit with these things.

infinite recusion

Otherwise, looks good to me. Positive review if a patchbot gives a green light.

Fixed. Will wait on a patchbot.

I am probably paranoid, but are all our Clifford algebras finite-dimensional? I don't know what can go into a `QuadraticForm`, so I can't tell...

Yes, currently `QuadraticForm` only works for finite-dimensional vector spaces.

Patchbot is (morally) green.
