I'm adding dima in the loop as I know nothing about permutation groups and this look very different (but it might be ok).

```diff
-            Permutation Group with generators [('01','02')('10','20')('11','22')('12','21'), ('00','11')('01','10')('02','12')('20','21')]
+            Permutation Group with generators [('02','10','21')('00','11','22')('01','12','20'), ('02','01')('10','20')('21','12')('22','11')]
```

They are isomorphic:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[('01','02'),('10','20'),('11','22'),('12','21')], [('00','11'),('01','10'),('02','12'),('20','21')]])
sage: H = PermutationGroup([[('02','10','21'),('00','11','22'),('01','12','20')], [('02','01'),('10','20'),('21','12'),('22','11')]])
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [('01','02')('10','20')('11','22')('12','21'), ('00','11')('01','10')('02','12')('20','21')]
sage: H
Permutation Group with generators [('01','02')('10','20')('11','22')('12','21'), ('00','11','22')('01','12','20')('02','10','21')]
sage: G.is_isomorphic(H)
True
```
