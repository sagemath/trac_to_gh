Keywords: Braid, braid group, Burau representation, Alexander polynomial, knot theory

Instances of Braid class could already return the image of the braid
under the Burau representation. This patch adds code to optionally
return the image under the reduced Burau representation. Using the
reduced Burau representation, it can also return the (unnormalized)
Alexander polynomial of the braid closure of the Braid.

Examples of the new functionality from the doc_strings:

    sage: B = BraidGroup(4)
    sage: B.inject_variables()
    Defining s0, s1, s2
    sage: s0.burau_matrix(reduced=True)
    [-t  0  0]
    [-t  1  0]
    [-t  0  1]
    sage: b = B([1,1,1,3,3,2,-3,-1,-1,2,-1,-3,-2])
    sage: b.alexander_polynomial() #The Kinoshita-Terasaka knot.
    -1/t

(The Kinoshita-Terasaka knot has Alexander polynomial 1; the
unnormalized Alexander polynomial is only well-defined up to
multiplication by plus or minus t^n.)

Are you sure that this is the correct reduced Burau matrix?, in the references i have checked it does not coincide:

For instance, shouldn't the elementary braids have something like


```
[1   t  0]
[0  -t  0]
[0   1  1]
```


as basic block?

It depends on the choice of basis. 

Right multiplication by the matrices in (Sage's implementation of) the Burau representation preserves the subspace {(x_1,...,x_n) | x_1+...+x_n=0}.  (Note that this is a row vector, and we are multiplying on the right by the matrix.)  The restriction of the representation to this subspace is the reduced Burau representation.  To turn this into matrices, we need to choose a basis for the subspace.

I think if you take the basis vectors (1,-1,0,0,...,0), (1,0,-1,0,...,0), (1,0,0,-1,...,0), etc., then you get the matrices I wrote down.  

Of course, I could have made a mistake; but the fact that the Alexander polynomial seems to work for fairly complicated knots (compare with the Knot Atlas) seems like good evidence that the matrices are right.

By the way, I think some references I looked at were wrong: some did not seem to satisfy the braid relations.

Either way is fine with me. If you would like to change the matrices to any other (correct) representatives for the representation, that's also fine.
