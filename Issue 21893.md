# Issue 21893: Remove __cmp__() methods in sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This ticket removes two instances of the method `__cmp__()` for finitely generated matrix groups; these are not needed because `MatrixGroup.__cmp__()` already compares the generators.  We also rewrite the doctests to avoid the function `cmp()`, which is not in Python 3.
