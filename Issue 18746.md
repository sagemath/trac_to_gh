You need to add doctests to all the new functions: there are 2 functions missing doctests.

see patchbot report

```
+Decreased doctests in game_theory/normal_form_game.py: from 28 / 28 = 100% to 43 / 45 = 95%
+Coverage went from 40228 / 42093 = 95.569% to 40243 / 42110 = 95.566%
+====================

-game_theory/normal_form_game.py: 100.0% (28 of 28)
+game_theory/normal_form_game.py: 95.6% (43 of 45)
```

Thanks. I've updated the two referenced functions.

please use python3-compatible syntax for print, namely `print("stuff")`

see patchbot report
