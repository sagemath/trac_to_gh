Which version? and what do you mean by "fail"? I get (sage-5.11.beta1)

```
Definition: bla(alarm, ellipsis_range, ellipsis_iter, srange, xsrange, sxrange, getitem, cputime, verbose, set_verbose, set_verbose_files, get_verbose_files, unset_verbose_files, get_verbose, version, banner, add, union, uniq, powerset, subsets, exists, forall, is_iterator, random_sublist, mul, walltime, generic_cmp, repr_lincomb, pad_zeros, attrcall, SAGE_DB, SAGE_TMP, is_32_bit, is_64_bit, newton_method_sizes, compose, self_compose, nest)
```

which is odd but no traceback...

I'm working with 5.10.beta5.

Where do I even get 5.11.beta1? The Development Release on the homepage is 5.10.rc2...

I can confirm that the problem is gone in 5.11.beta1. The problem occurred with the "matroids" keyword from #7477, and that gives a normal documentation now.

Can I mark it as "duplicate/invalid/wontfix" or is that up to the release manager?

You mark it as duplicate/invalid/wontfix and set status to needs_review
