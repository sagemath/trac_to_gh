# Issue 22558: Fixing a typo in error message within finite subgroups of modular abelian varieties

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: klui

Original creation time: 2017-04-10 23:02:51

Keywords: intersection modular abelian variety

In line 394 is part of the definition for the intersection method but it said

```
raise TypeError("only addition of two finite subgroups is defined")
```


This should be changed to

```
raise TypeError("only intersection with a finite subgroup or modular abelian variety is defined")
```

Seems good, but when you are working with this, can also the note "TODO: Intersection, action of Hecke operators." at the beginning now be removed?
