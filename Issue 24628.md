This is unexpected:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(4)
sage: matrix(a, nrows=2, ncols=2)
[0 1]
[1 1]
```

because one would typically expect a scalar matrix instead:

```
sage: R.<a> = EisensteinIntegers()
sage: matrix(a, nrows=2, ncols=2)
[a 0]
[0 a]
```

This is because finite field elements implement `_matrix_` and takes priority in the matrix constructor.

Is there are particular reason? The patchbot is green...
