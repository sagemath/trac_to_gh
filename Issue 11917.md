Keywords: singular, cygwin

singular-3-1-3-3.p1 does not build on Cygwin, as Singular's internal libraries libkernel and libhtmlhelp are now built as static, and they cannot be linked using the usual -l syntax. Rather, one needs to list them much like .o files.

The draft package is malformed somehow.

```
sage: After decompressing the directory singular-3-1-3-3.p1-cygwindraft does not exist
This means that the corresponding .spkg needs to be downloaded
again.
```
I think you have to name the spkg the same as the folder which is compressed.  I'll try renaming the folder and trying it again.

I've done exactly that same thing in making spkgs before!  Spkg is updated at [singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/kcrisman/singular-3-1-3-3.p2.spkg).  The new patch only is applied on Cygwin.  Diff attached for reference in review.

Dima, I'll test this just now, but if it builds, then I think it would just require you to sign off on it.

Dima or Volker or someone, can you report this upstream?

I don't really agree with the solution developed here.

My guess is that the Makefile.in is just broken because a -L../kernel on generic system got transformed into -L/bin.

I'll post an updated spkg based on the updated Singular spkg by Jeroen at #13237 with that approach when my new build on Cygwin fails at Singular.
I'll report upstream as well.
