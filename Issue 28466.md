When linking the `PyNormaliz_cpp.dll` module, there is a long spew of errors  mostly in two classes that look like:


```

There basically seem to be two broad classes of problems here; one is linking with its library dependencies, either eantic or libnormaliz, or both.  Another seems to be with functions that require OpenMP.

It seems libnormaliz is compiled with `-fopenmp` by default, but since pynormaliz isn't, this breaks.

I don't think an upstream issue for this needed to be reported.  I don't think it's an issue with pynormaliz so much as how it's being built in Sage.  I think it used to work, in fact.  It might have broken as part of #27444

Changing component from packages: optional to porting: Cygwin.

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
