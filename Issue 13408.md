In some cases a padic element can not be initialized from the zero of the residue field:


```
sage: K=Qp(3)
sage: R.<a> = K[]
sage: L.<a> = K.extension(a^2+1)
sage: L(L.residue_field().one())
1 + O(3)
sage: L(L.residue_field().zero())
TypeError: cannot convert x to a p-adic element
```


The attached patch fixes this issue.
