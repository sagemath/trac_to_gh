# Issue 24266: improve `LazyAlgebraic`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24503

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2018-01-10 11:30:22

In order to be used consistently with `QQbar` and number fields, the class `LazyAlgebraic` in `sage.rings.real_lazy` should be made

- faster - among other things we provide C and Cython versions of the `eval` method for all floating point types (`mpfr`, `mpc`, `mpfi`, `arb`, etc)
- more accurate: certify that it is a given root of a polynomial from its creation
- more autonomous (the `eval` is computing the roots each time!!)

As a follow-up ticket, we replace most of the structure for dealing with embedded real fields using this enhanced `LazyAlgebraic`.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
