In order to be used consistently with `QQbar` and number fields, the class `LazyAlgebraic` in `sage.rings.real_lazy` should be made

- faster - among other things we provide C and Cython versions of the `eval` method for all floating point types (`mpfr`, `mpc`, `mpfi`, `arb`, etc)
- more accurate: certify that it is a given root of a polynomial from its creation
- more autonomous (the `eval` is computing the roots each time!!)

As a follow-up ticket, we replace most of the structure for dealing with embedded real fields using this enhanced `LazyAlgebraic`.
