Yes, this is probably a good idea at this point!  I'll try to run this - I had troubled upgrading so I'll need to do a new version of Sage.  Patchbot seems to not be saying anything yet.

Just a question for the author - are the `copy(m)`-style tests (or *very* similar ones) anywhere else in Sage (e.g. in the `__copy__` method)?  It would be unfortunate to lose those.

This is long tests.

It seemed to me yesterday that all the examples were present in some form in the other files. You can run something like

```
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix
$ grep -C10 'def __copy__' *.py*
```

to see some of the doctests. The last test in the `copy()` method is actually a bit strange and so I have copied that code into the `matrix_generic_dense.pyx` file. The [attachment:trac_15132-remove_matrix_copy.patch patch] has been accordingly updated.

Great, thanks.  Also thanks for using a patch - I have not been initiated into the git system yet, and so I have zero clue how to review tickets with commits but not patches.
