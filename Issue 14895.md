Yes, this is probably a good idea at this point!  I'll try to run this - I had troubled upgrading so I'll need to do a new version of Sage.  Patchbot seems to not be saying anything yet.

Just a question for the author - are the `copy(m)`-style tests (or *very* similar ones) anywhere else in Sage (e.g. in the `__copy__` method)?  It would be unfortunate to lose those.

It seemed to me yesterday that all the examples were present in some form in the other files. You can run something like

```
$ cd SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage/sage/matrix
$ grep -C10 'def __copy__' *.py*
```
to see some of the doctests. The last test in the `copy()` method is actually a bit strange and so I have copied that code into the `matrix_generic_dense.pyx` file. The [attachment:trac_15132-remove_matrix_copy.patch patch] has been accordingly updated.
