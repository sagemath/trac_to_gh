Mathematica seems to agree with you, but https://dlmf.nist.gov/10.47#E3 gives (assuming I'm reading it correctly) the previously implemented definition. I am not really familiar with spherical Bessel functions; are you sure that the change is consistent with general usage and with the rest of Sage?

Edit: on the other hand, the DLMF also states that j_n(-z) = (-1)<sup>n</sup>·j_n(z) with no restriction on z...

Then there is something I don't understand. With the DLMF definition I linked to (and assuming the standard branch of the square root), one has:

```
sage: n = 3
sage: z = -4
sage: CBF(1/2*pi/z).sqrt()*CBF(z).bessel_J(n+1/2)
[0.229243857955030 +/- 5.17e-16]
```

Your patch changes that result to its opposite.

If you repeat the evaluation with `z=4` you'll get exactly the same result, which contradicts the identity you mentioned [above](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28474?#comment:4). You can verify the identity by looking at these functions [expressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel_function#Spherical_Bessel_functions:_jn,_yn) in terms of circular functions: they need to be odd in the argument for odd `n`.

In my own JavaScript [library](https://github.com/paulmasson/math) I had assumed that the straightforward calculation would give the standard branch but it doesn't. I only noticed the issue here while fixing the same [issue](https://github.com/paulmasson/math/issues/5) in my library.

Ok. I suppose this does mean that the identity given by the DLMF (and already by Abramowitz & Stegun) is not valid for negative z...
