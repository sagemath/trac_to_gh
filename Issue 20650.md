The commits here and at #22522 are exactly the same (last being `507aea5`). You need to be clear about what belong to which ticket and update the branches accordingly.

there is a test that's being incorrectly parsed by the bot (in the shell it's fine):

(migrated from #22522)

Replying to [comment:26 mkoeppe]:
> Integration over an RDF polyhedron via QQ polyhedron (latte) could make sense _as long as the method converts the answer back to RDF_ to indicate that the answer is inexact.

Ok, that makes sense! Moreover Vincent convinced me that coercing and instantiating like that is a bad idea, potentially very costly and because it's hidden. In the new patch that's been reverted, but an illustrative example was added.
 
> As to `change_ring`, this could be useful. I had related discussions with JP.

I've created #22574 for change_ring and #22575 for change_backend.

```

```

this should be "cone decomposition".

`Polyhedron.integrate` should include tests for lower-dimensional polytopes. Those are not supported by latte's integrate. The result should either be 0 - or a proper error should be raised.

wait a moment, because i may have misunderstood:

1- if the polytope is not full-dimensional, but the polynomial is in low dimension, then latte gives an answer wrt to the relative interior, as in:


```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import integrate as integrate
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: integrate(P.cdd_Hrepresentation(), 2*x^2 + x - 1, cdd=True)
1/6
```


and we should keep this behaviour. 

2- however, in the situation of a multivariate polynomial in a low-dim polytope it breaks,


```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[1,1]])
sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import integrate as integrate
sage: x, y = polygens(QQ, 'x, y')
sage: integrate(P.cdd_Hrepresentation(), 2*x^2 + x - y, cdd=True)
...
SetLength: can't change this vector's length
```


and we should raise an exception.

can you confirm?

Unfortunately, there is no control over what exact transformation LattE applies; and so the input polynomial is meaningless even though it has the correct number of variables.

ok then; commit ec15897 raises exception in both cases.

thanks Matthias; i did run the tests before submitting, but there was this "<BLANKLINE>" thing that i didn't know how to solve. but actually it was a trivial error on my side. anyway, commit ​1cf59f4 shall fix it.

I have to ask, at no point are importing `is_package_installed` from `sage.misc.package` or `sage.misc.all`, yet you are using it. How it is that you don't get "global name `is_package_installed` is not defined"?

I should have thought about that! Never mind "is_package_installed", it is only visible at all because you forgot to mark that particular test `#optional - latte_int`.

Doesn't fbissey's comment regarding `is_package_installed` need addressing?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-03-30 06:40:08

It's a funny, it has to work due to a chain of import from `all.py` 

```
from sage.misc.all 	 import *         # takes a while
```

and in `misc/all.py`

```
from .package import (installed_packages, is_package_installed,
        standard_packages, optional_packages, experimental_packages,
        package_versions)
```

But most other call to it, do an explicit import. I would think it is supposed to work unless I am missing something.

but `is_package_installed` is imported above (line 25). it also has to be imported in the function body? thanks.

Comment by fbissey created at 2017-03-30 06:53:43

Let's call it a "user" error and forget about my comment about it. I have stuff from the feature branch which removes it. I didn't notice that this file was touched by it. That's why it is absent on my stuff.
