That's one reason why I cc'ed the spkg maintainers... ;-) 

Note that Gfan 0.4plus is of late 2009; Gfan 0.5 was released more than a year ago.  Haven't checked whether the latter fixes the C++11 issues, but since it introduces new functionality (and probably also new bugs), I haven't tried using that.

From my updated `SPKG.txt`:

```
TODO:
 * Use `patch` to apply patches (then also add GNU patch to the dependencies).
 * Clean up `spkg-install` further w.r.t. installation etc.
 * Probably remove `CXXFLAG64` from the (patched) Makefile; instead put it
   into `LDFLAGS` and use these in the Makefile.
 * The Makefile is still suboptimal; e.g. Sage-specific values shouldn't be
   hardcoded into it.  That way we could provide a clean patch for upstream,
   and would later only have to change/set `make` variables in `spkg-install`,
   without the need to patch the Makefile at all for Sage.
   Also `CXXFLAGS` aren't used in, i.e. ignored by the current Makefile.
```


I'll probably fix *some* of these *here* **later**<sup>TM</sup> as well, especially item 1, and perhaps also items 3 and 2, but because of #11395, I won't do much more at the moment.

Well, these have been in before (and the respective files were of course user-readable, and they don't get installed anyway).

Anyway, fixed; new spkg, same place.
