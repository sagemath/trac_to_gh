As discussed in #24222.

We already have `PY_VERSION_HEX` which can be useful for more fine-grained version comparisons, but `PY_MAJOR_VERSION` is easier to use and read in particular for general checks of Python 2 vs. Python >= 3.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24246
