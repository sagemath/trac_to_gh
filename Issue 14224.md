Keywords: tachyon 3d plot raytrace

Currently the sage objects created by 

```
sage: t = Tachyon() 
```
only accept certain drawn primitives that are predefined inside **sage/plot/plot3d/tachyon.py** after they are created, e.g. using sphere, plane, cylinder methods to insert those figures. General sage 3d plots can't be added to such scenes. A round about method using 

```
sage: var('x y')
(x, y)
sage: a = plot3d(sin(x+y), (x, -4, 4), (y, -4, 4))
sage: tachyon_rt(a.tachyon())
```

is possible, however most of the options are hard-coded into **sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx**. Even worse the whole scene is treated as one large text file making any further manipulation difficult at best.

This definitely needs to be done :)  I'm not sure of the best way to go about it -- I had a different approach in mind, and yet another way is outlined at [this AskSage answer](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/20/the-tachyon-object-used-for-rendering-plots?answer=4703#4703).

I've cleaned up and attached some function definitions that outline the approach I had in mind.  Part of it is similar to the approach of anton_t, but it also includes some code for extracting a tachyon scene string from a graphics object and some code for joining the objects from a scene string into another Tachyon object.

It's still in a very sketchy state, and I'm not yet sure this is the best approach, but it's what I have at the moment :)
