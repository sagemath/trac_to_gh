Keywords: cluster algebras, SageDays64.5

This module uses structural results from "Cluster algebras IV" to implement cluster algebras as a subobject of `LaurentPolynomialRing_generic`.

It provides a new class `ClusterAlgebra` and two auxiliary classes `ClusterAlgebraSeed` and `ClusterAlgebraElement`.

I have just launched my own patchbot on the ticket.

There are some missing empty lines, for example here

```
+    EXAMPLES::
+        sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['B',2],principal_coefficients=True)
```

> There are some missing empty lines, for example here
I just fixed that; thank you for catching it. Is there any automatic way to check that the code adhere to all the conventions?
I only know of autopep8 but this does not test docstrings. 
(By the way we have plenty of long lines so we do not really adhere to pep8
either.)


On a different topic: there has been a discussion on sage-devel on the best way
to implement the exploring iterator. The discussion migrated to #21312 where the
possibility to use `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` has been explored. It turns out that
this can be done gaining a significant slowdown. I ended up writing the
current solution. A migration to `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` might be considered
for a follow-up ticket. I am just writing this here for the record.

thanks.

some more remarks:

* pep8 is for code, not for documentation. It was not necessary to add a space after all commas in the doc. You can use "pep8 --ignore=E501 file.py" to check if there remains errors (and where).

* you should rather just do "from six.moves import range" and search-and-replace xrange by range. We are on the way to remove all xrange from sage (except in cython files)

* I am a bit puzzled by your strange manipulations of the doc (using `__doc__`) This is ugly code, imho.

* and I have the same bad feeling about your way to add methods only in special cases.. But maybe this is because I have never seen anything like that before

* a general remark on the doc is that after a single colon, you should not indent by 4, because the single colon is not defining a block. 

* maybe not for now, but for the user who wants index starting at one, one may like to implement something like "index_set" (that exists for root systems, I think)


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2016-10-19 19:04:36

More comments:

* probably .rk should be .rank (we prefer explicit names)

* `+ (a1, a2) = d_vector` could be `+ a1, a2 = d_vector` (and same thing in other places)

* remains at least one "usethe" and "itareator"

* in 
`+        g_mon = prod([self.ambient().gen(i)**g_vector[i] for i in xrange(self.rk())])`
you do not need the square bracket inside the prod.

* typo "g_vetor"

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-10-21 11:00:36

After Frederic already started with a structural review, I finally take some time to play with the code.

Here is the list of points I want to mention concerning the documentation:

* The documentation start is too technical for my taste, containing many implementation details. I suggest to start with a brief description (or links) to what cluster algebras are + (even more importantly) followed by the later provided good examples. Only after, there should be a description of the algorithms used (I personally would even prefer to be pointed to the exact theorem) + the details of the implementation you give.

* some example sentences start with capital letters, some with small letters

* I agree with Frederic's "I have [...] bad feeling about your way to add methods only in special cases". Often, this is solved raising a `NotImplementedError`. On the other hand, I hate those errors and would often prefer if I rather not have a given method...


---

Comment by stumpc5 created at 2016-10-21 11:13:53

Concerning the usage:

* If I want to use `A.F_polynomials()`, I have to first explore and then get the F-polys so far. I suggest to add `def F_polynomials()` as an iterator.

* Maybe I misunderstand the objects, but shouldn't there be `A.d_vectors()` (and `A.c_vectors()` in the case of principal coefficients)?

Beside that, I did play with it for a while and it really seemed to behave nicely and intuitively!

I am okay with having the module-level documentation being somewhat technical. However, I strongly think the main bulk of the documentation should be at the class-level for `ClusterAlgebra` (with the `__init__` only being a short 1-line and `TESTS::` with a (few) `TestSuite(C).run()` calls). This way the user can get it by `ClusterAlgebra?`.

> * I agree with Frederic's "I have [...] bad feeling about your way to add methods only in special cases". Often, this is solved raising a `NotImplementedError`. On the other hand, I hate those errors and would often prefer if I rather not have a given method...

I would recommend using ``@`abstract_method` (if optional to implement, you can do ``@`abstract_method(optional=True)`). While it doesn't remove the method if it is not implemented, it does prevent the user from looking at its doc (and the TestSuite` will fail if such a method is found).

Also the `ALGORITHM:` should not be indented.

The problem then is that looking at the html documentation might scare users to further look.

Thanks everybody for the in depth comments and sorry for taking so long to
reply. 

I just updated the code implementing most of your suggestions. Here are some
extra remarks:

* xrange has been removed

* several indentations has been fixed in the documentation

* implementing index_set is probably a good idea but I might prefer to get first
  a positive review on this. I already know how this should be implemented and
  it will not take much.
 
* as far as the manipulation of `__doc__` I am posting a request for comments on
  sage-devel to see what is the general consensus on how to best implement this.

* same holds for methods not always defined

* brackets inside `prod()` and `dict()` has been removed

* `F_polynomials` is now implemented as an iterator

* I am not implementing c-vectors at this stage because, as the code is
  structured right now, we do not keep track of them. A future patch will
  address the issue of storing and producing exchange relations; c-vectors
  belong to that

* `d_vectors`: I did not implement it yet but it is easily doable. This raises a
  question concerning `cluster_variables` and `F_polynomials`.
  These, as `d_vectors` would be, are simple syntactic sugar around a `map`. For
  example `cluster_variables` is the same as
  {{{
  sage: map(A.cluster_variable, A.g_vectors())
  }}}
  is it worth implementing such methods or should we just get rid of them?
  Pros: less code to maintain!
  Cons: users might be scared?

Now to the more serious issue: I tried implementing Travis's suggestion about
documentation and I ran into some issues with `TestSuite` that I can't wrap my
head around. It looks like instances of neither `ClusterAlgebraElement` nor
`ClusterAlgebraSees` can't be dumped with `dumps`. 

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['B',4])
sage: x = A.initial_cluster_variable(0)
sage: S = A.current_seed()
sage: from six.moves import cPickle
sage: cPickle.dumps(x, protocol=2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PicklingError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-78bafcb24ef1> in <module>()
----> 1 cPickle.dumps(x, protocol=Integer(2))

PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
sage: cPickle.dumps(S, protocol=2)

----> 1 cPickle.dumps(S, protocol=Integer(2))

```


Where am I being stupid?


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-06 21:17:35

You don't have a pickling protocol implemented for the parent. Actually, I don't see why you aren't using `UniqueRepresentation`. Also, instead of manually setting the methods, you should use a subclass and dynamically set the `Element` of `ClusterAlgebra`.


---

Comment by etn40ff created at 2016-11-06 21:36:25

Thanks, I will move `ClusterAlgebra` to `UniqueRepresentation` and test if there are no undesired side effects. I am not sure myself why we did not do it earlier; we might have had reasons but I can't remember them right now.

Which methods are you referring to? Isn't enough to set `Element = ClusterAlgebraElement` inside `ClusterAlgebra`?

You can do it in the `__init__` as long as you do it before you make the call to `Parent.__init__`.


---

Comment by etn40ff created at 2016-11-06 21:59:00

Ok now I remember why we ended up not using `UniqueRepresentation`: in many (read "in every one I can think of") cases we want to be able to invoke  `ClusterAlgebra` on non hashable arguments.


---

Comment by etn40ff created at 2016-11-06 22:17:39

Sorry I am particularly slow with understanding tonight. 

Are you saying that instead of using `MethodType` in the cases when I want them
I should define a subclass containing also the extra methods and dynamically
pick the right one in __init__? 
I am not sure this will work in both cases: I can see how it will help for the
extra methods in `ClusterAlgebraElement` but how do you make it work for the
extra methods in `ClusterAlgebra`?
The only way I see is to introduce a factory but I would really prefer to
avoid doing that.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-06 22:20:29

What would be an example? For matrices, we can make an immutable copy or some other equivalent (hashable) data. Same for quivers. (At least I would think `ClusterAlgebraSeed` would fulfill this role.)

This approach is not very readable (subsequently harder to debug) and strongly breaks encapsulation. So I am strongly against it. Also, I believe you should be using `UniqueRepresentation`, where the `__classcall(_private)__` can be used as a factory. Although you can just add the `ClasscallMetaclass` to get the same behavior to return the subclass.

Comment by etn40ff created at 2016-11-06 23:21:11

OK I might have found a way to make everyone happy. What about something like
this?


```
class MyClass(Parent):
    
    def __init__(self):
    	# do something here
    	pass
    
    if somecondition:
    	def method_not_always_defines(self):
	    # do something else here
	    pass

    def method_always_defined(self):
        # do nothing
        pass
```


I do not know why I did not think of something of this sort before. The only thing I haven't figured out yet is whether it is possible for somecondition to be dependent on the argument with which `MyClass` is called.


---

Comment by etn40ff created at 2016-11-06 23:27:50

When I said non hashable I meant that they are not hashable on the nose but can be made hashable. Basically one would like to feed in anything that can be already interpreted by `ClusterQuiver` that take also non hashable inputs.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-06 23:39:50

Well the data you really want is `ClusterQuiver` or `ClusterSeed`, so you really should use `UniqueRepresentation` as it solves a number of problems.

comment:41 is better, but I'm still -1. Use subclasses.

I prefer to look at the usage from, well, the user's perspective. And using

```
sage: map(A.cluster_variable, A.g_vectors())
```

implies that I have understood already how the implementation works (or, at least, that I have read through the documentation). I'd therefore prefer to have explicit methods providing all sorts of data attached to a cluster seed (independent from how you handle the seed internally).

Just my 2 cents, it's your code so it's your decision what to provide how...

I will give it a try with `UniqueRepresentation` and report back when I am done. 
I am unfortunately quite short on time for sage lately so this may take a while.

As for subclasses I am quite against the idea because I will, hopefully soon,
add more methods defined only in certain cases and I would have to make a lot of
classes just to mix and match all the possibilities. I posted a reply on
sage-devel on this and I might just define the methods in any case and have them
raise and error when they are meaningless. Unless of course someone suggests
a better idea.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-15 00:45:49

With the current code, you should use subclasses. In the future, for the more corner case situations, I would then raise a `TypeError` when the particular method does not apply. I should have some time next week during the Sage Days to attack things if you'd want me to.

I played a little with `UniqueRepresentation` and there are some issues arising from `mutate_initial` (and `mutate`).
If your offer still holds I would be happy to talk any time this week except for Thursday.

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-22 08:50:55

I've used subclasses for the elements to begin with and done my pass over the documentation. ~~I'm doing the subclasses for the parents next, which should be pushed in minute.~~ Correction: That will likely depend on how the `ClusterAlgebra` class changes with `UniqueRepresentation`, which I can't really do until I understand the difference below.

I don't understand why we need the `ClusterAlgebraSeed` when it seems like all of that functionality is (essentially) done by `ClusterSeed`.

I would appreciate some time to Skype at some point today or tomorrow (I'm 1 hour ahead from Paris time I believe) to go over things. We can set that up over e-mail.

Changing keywords from "cluster algebras, SageDays64.5" to "cluster algebras, SageDays64.5, days79".


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2016-11-22 15:34:55

Here is the short summary of our discussion:

* We will replace `initial_mutate` by something called `change_initial_seed` (the name has not really been decided) to create a new cluster algebra using another seed `s` as initial data and copy the old data into the new cluster algebra using `s` (and its mutation sequence).

* We will remove the decorator and implement the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior for `ClusterAlgebra`.

* We will have the greedy element method as a method for all cluster algebras but raise a `NotImplementedError` for when it is not rank 2.

I started working on `UniqueRepresentation` and I think the prototype is ok. I did not touch `mutate_initial` yet.

One extremely weird issue: if you run

```
sage -b
sage -t --long src/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.py
sage -t --long src/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.py
```

the first test will pass while the second will fail. It looks like the cache is not cleared in between tests. Ideas?

I cannot reproduce that behavior: I get 3 failures on every run.

Ok `UniqueRepresentation` is now part of the code. Any comment?

One thing that bothers me is that we still can create different algebras that should be the same because the parsing of `cluster_variable_names` and symilar is done in `__init__` rather than in `__classcall__`.  Would there be drawbacks in moving these?

Hi Emily,

I think the fix you made for the references was not the correct one: if I am not mistaken the goal is to go towards a unified reference system. 

I created a new ticket to fix the duplication in `ClusterSeed` #22160 (which needs a quick review) and I will shortly update a new version of this branch to reflect the changes. 
Once this is done this ticket will depend on #22160.

Thank you Frédéric. I just rebased to the current develop and now it builds cleanly on my machine. Tests seems ok so far. I am starting my patchbot to run overnight.

On 64-bit it works. Which is the correct way to doctest hash functions
independently of the architecture?

Copy and paste Volker's output with `# 32-bit` and `# 64-bit`. Although I prefer the softest that `hash(x) == hash(x)`.

Done, thanks. I am setting this back to positive review because I do not have a 32-bit machine to test.
