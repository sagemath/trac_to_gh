# Issue 14417: Bitwise xor documentation in the tutorial and FAQ

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14621

Original creator: mathzeta2

Original creation time: 2013-05-20 18:03:13

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: xor

I just found this gem in the Sage preparser: It parses `^^` as a single `^` for the exclusive or operator.

The attached patch fixes the Sage Tutorial and FAQ sections in the documentation with this little info.

Please submit a proper Mercurial patch, with the necessary meta data (see [http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/walk_through.html#submitting-a-change); you can of course use `hg` (or `sage --hg`) commands directly if you prefer).

And afterwards, set the ticket to "needs review".

Just asking... in the code for `preparse` we have

```
    # Use ^ for exponentiation and ^^ for xor
    # (A side effect is that **** becomes xor as well.)
    L = L.replace('^', '**').replace('****', '^')
```

Do we want to document the `****` here?  My preference is not to do so, but since we didn't even have the `^^` documented (though I know a lot of people who did use it), maybe we should document it too.

Otherwise very nice work!

Oh, Karl-Dieter, I was just going to add the "beginner" keyword ... ;-D

(since it is easy to review)

I wouldn't document it (other than in the code) either, since it's an _unintended_ side-effect, may change one day, I don't think anybody is going to use that "feature", and it's unlikely to break anything (i.e., it's IMHO not a pitfall typical users may run into).
