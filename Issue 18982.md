CyLP is a Cython interface to COIN-OR’s Linear and mixed-integer program solvers (CLP, CBC, and CGL).

We should add a MILP backend that goes through CyLP, because the interface is much more complete than Sage's current COIN interface. In particular, quoting from CyLP's README:

"CyLP’s unique feature is that you can use it to alter the solution process of the solvers from within Python. For example, you may define cut generators, branch-and-bound strategies, and primal/dual Simplex pivot rules completely in Python."

Of course, CyLP has an incompatible license (CPL), but it does not matter because COIN has that license already.

I don't have anything against what you plan to do, but why exactly do you want to add a `CyLP` backend? It may be true that `CyLP` has more features exposed than our current interface, but then the same thing remains: in the backend, you will have to expose the features that are exposed in `CyLP`, exactly how we have to do now by exposing in the coin backend the features that are exposed in the C++ Api.

Matthias builds a database of ILP cutting planes constructions (Actually I talked to him yesterday about it at length). 

He wants his cuts to be as painless as possible:)
