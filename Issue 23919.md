# Issue 23919: Construction of RealSet from inequality

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-11-05 07:41:54

Make this possible:

```
sage: RealSet(x>0)
(0, +oo)

at the moment:
...
ValueError: x > 0 does not determine real interval
```

Can you add tests for `x <= oo`, `x >= oo`, and `x >= -oo` to check these (essentially corner) cases? Otherwise LGTM.

I somehow introduced this, needs to be fixed:

```
sage: RealSet(-oo,oo)
(-oo, +Infinity)
sage: RealSet(0,oo)
(0, +oo)
```
