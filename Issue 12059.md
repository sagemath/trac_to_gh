Calculate factor complexity of a substutitive language (see #12227). Factor complexity counts the number of factors of length n. 

An effective way using families of bispecial factors and formula of (Cassaigne Julien. Complexité et facteurs spéciaux [Complexity and special factors]. Journées Montoises (Mons, 1994). Bull. Belg. Math. Soc. Simon Stevin 4, no. 1, 67--88, 1997) can be used. In some cases, a closed formula may be also found using this method.
