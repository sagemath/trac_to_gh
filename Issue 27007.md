Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-02-09 11:53:41

Keywords: py3, graph

We fix a failing doctest with py3 and
- change a test using `sorted` with a test using `set`. More robust
- clean the creation of mappings vertex to int and int to vertex
- speed up the addition of edges to the sparse/dense graph
