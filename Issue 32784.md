Does `not foo` trigger the warning? I don't think we need to worry about it too much, but this is a user-facing option, so the comparison allows things like `fill=0` to work, although I agree that it's bad form. (`implicit_plot` throws a warning if `fill` is not literally `True` or `False`, but `contour_plot` does not.)
