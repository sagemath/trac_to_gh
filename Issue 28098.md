I have cythonized the Yen and Feng's methods here as can be seen from the last commit in the list of above commits.

In short I have used cython variables and cython data structures where ever possible in these methods.

Also I have named the cython methods as yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_cython and feng_k_shortest_simple_paths_cython to separate them from yen_k_shortest_simple_paths and feng_k_shortest_simple_paths for consistency and speed checks.
feng_k_shortest_simple_paths
Changes will be more clear once #27859 gets included.

The way you declare the priority queue is incorrect. This will fail if edge weights are not integers.

The list `idx_to_path` stores all paths, and you never remove any. So it can become giant. Can't you instead use a dictionary and a counter to assign each new path a unique id, and remove paths that are no longer useful ? In fact, you can certainly combine `idx_to_path` and `heap_paths` in a unique dictionary, no ?

Seems correct.
The next step is to speed up the test `hash_path not in idx_to_path.values()`, but I don't have good ideas yet on how to do that.

After thinking about the utility of the hash_path not in idx_to_path.values() test , it seems like we don't really require it as per our algorithm as we are working on graphs without multiedges hence the path will no be repeated into the heap. So this test is unnecessary here.

Also the test supporting it is shown in the above comment.

Now that #27859 has been merged, it's much easier to check the code ;)

Instead of creating new methods, I propose to replace the code of the previous Yen's method by the code of the Cython version, and to do the same for Feng.
