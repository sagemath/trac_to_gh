`tides` has this in upstream's `Makefile.am`:

```
AM_CPPFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include
```

This should be fixed since it may include unwanted stuff from `/usr/local/include`.

Shouldn't it be


```
$MAKE AM_CPPFLAGS="-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include"
```


instead of 



```
$MAKE AM_CPPFLAGS="-I $SAGE_LOCAL/include"
```

?

None of the above :-)

I'm using

```
$MAKE AM_CPPFLAGS="-I '$SAGE_LOCAL/include'"
```


Just look at the `make` logs, the output is correct.
