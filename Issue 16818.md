Hi Travis,

I'm getting some unexpected(?) behavior in certain cases.  For example:


```
sage: RC = crystals.infinity.RiggedConfigurations("D4")
sage: T = crystals.infinity.Tableaux("D4")
sage: Psi = RC.crystal_morphism({RC.module_generators[0]:T.module_generators[0]})
sage: RCS = RC.subcrystal(max_depth=4)
sage: for nu in RCS:                                   
....:    if Psi(nu) != T(nu):
....:        print False
....: print True
```


This produces a lot of `False` results.  By contrast, this example worked in types `"A2"`, `"A3"`, and `"A4"`.  Shouldn't the coercion agree with the usual crystal isomorphism between the two?

Best,
Ben
