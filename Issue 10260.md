As noticed by Florent Hivert [here](http://groups.google.com/group/sage-combinat-devel/browse_thread/thread/b24d16504611c73f), the following two objects :


```
sage: w = Word('010120')
sage: z = Word([0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0])
```


have the same string representation :


```
sage: w
word: 010120
sage: z
word: 010120
```


but are not equal :


```
sage: w == z
False
```


Indeed, w and z are defined on different alphabet :


```
sage: w[2]
'0'
sage: z[2]
0
```


Documentation about this should be improved.
