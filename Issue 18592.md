While working on #18746, I met a doctest error for a doctest that never appeared in my file. I looked at it for a while before undersdtanding what was happening. This branch adds the 'hint' I needed at that time.

Shouldn't you set this patch to `needs review`? 

I assume than for testing it we have no choice but doctesting the full `src/sage/` directory. Right?

Agggggg, I am an idiot. I had started all tests when I created the branch, and this morning I closed a remote ssh session without knowing what it had been testing. It was probably this patch. I'll re-run the tests `T_T`

Can you just define a string constant for

```
"sig_on_count() # check sig_on/off pairings (virtual doctest)\n"
```

instead of writing the same string several times.

Done !

For this kind of trivial changes, it is not too daring for a reviewer to propose a commit `^^;`
