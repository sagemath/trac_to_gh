Sage segfaults when printing a copy of something symbolics :


```
Â sage: copy(x) 

------------------------------------------------------------ 
 Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage. 
 This probably occurred because a *compiled* component 
 of Sage has a bug in it (typically accessing invalid memory) 
 or is not properly wrapped with _sig_on, _sig_off. 
 You might want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this. 
 Sage will now terminate (sorry). 
 ------------------------------------------------------------
```

This does not happen with "deepcopy": 



```
sage: deepcopy(x)
x
```
