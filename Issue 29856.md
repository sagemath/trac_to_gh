We don't need to run extensive test suites for `curl` and `git`: (a) if they have problems, they don't affect the mathematical correctness of Sage's output, they just affect the build process; (b) if they have minor problems, they won't even affect the build process, so we shouldn't care; (c) these particular test suites can take a *long* time, at least for `git`, and they often fail; (d) most users already have these on their systems outside of Sage.
