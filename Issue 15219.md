CC:  sdenton aschilling nthiery sage-combinat

The `has_right_descents` method in `WeylGroup` element methods calls `has_left_descents` and vice versa.  This causes an error in the following example.


```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',4])
sage: w = W.from_reduced_word([3,4,2])
sage: w.has_right_descent(3)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```


The doc tests for this method make calls to `CoxeterGroup` code to test it and so all tests pass.

Hi Mike!

This is not a bug but a feature :-)

When implementing a Coxeter group one can choose to either implement has_right_descent or has_left_descent (or both), and the Coxeter group category provides a default implementation for the other, if needed.

Granted, it would be nice if there was a nicer error message mentionning that at least one of has_left_descent or has_right_descent should be implemented. However, at this point, we have not generic infrastructure for this kind of situation, and it would be a bit tedious to do it by hand (but ideas on how to handle this are welcome!).

Cheers,

Hi Nicolas,

This can't be a feature.  In `WeylGroup` this is a bug.  In `CoxeterGroup` it is correct.

In `WeylGroups` the method `has_right_descent` and `has_left_descent` don't do anything except call each other.

Right. The proper specification is:

- at least one of has_descent / has_right_descent / has_left_descent should be implemented
- in generic code, always use has_descent, not has_*_descent.

This definitely should be put in the doc if not yet there.

I take the part about it being correct in `CoxeterGroup` back.  It seems to only be correct for the `CoxeterGroups().example()`.

I assume that you are right in that "Coxeter group category provides a default implementation for the other" but no one has implemented `has_right_descent` or `has_left_descent` for any of the finite or affine `WeylGroups` or `CoxeterGroups` (to an end user of these groups, this is a bug because it should just raise a `Not Implemented` error).

Is the correct solution then that 

(1) someone needs to implement them for each of the types 

(2) that the default implementation should be `has_left_descent` should call `has_descent(self, side="left")`

(3) the default implementation of `has_right_descent` should raise a `Not Implemented` error

(4) something else?

Hey Tom,

The problem is that `has_descent()` wasn't being brought into the loop, so if that was the only thing implemented, then one couldn't use `has_left_descent()` as expects. Thus [comment:4 the spec]:

>* at least one of has_descent / has_right_descent / has_left_descent should be implemented

would be satisfied in my proposal.

Although I think we could do a modified version of your proposal 1) by implementing some kind of modification to ``@`abstract_method`. Something like

```
@abstract_method(circular=['foo', 'bar'])
```

where if `foo` and `bar` were also called, then error out.

I couldn't find an indication that the documentation specifies that at least one of has_descent / has_right_descent / has_left_descent should be implemented.

Instead it seems to be that the default implementation of `has_descent` calls `has_left`or`right_descent`

Maybe we should throw checks in `_test_has_descent` to ensure that all of the functions work.

Here is new (better) proposal:

The main idea is "please never override has_descent" and "please implement either has_left_descent or has_right_descent" in every instance (if only as a place holder raising `NotImplementedError`).

In `categories/coxeter_group`, there is only the mechanism:

* has_descent calls either has_left_descent or has right_descent
* they call each other

In instances of Coxeter group, one implements either has_left_descent or has_right_descent or both. Even in a minimalistic way, raising a `NotImplementedError`.

What do you think ?

I am in favor of saying we must implement either `has_left_descent()` or `has_right_descent()`. Also possibly implementing has_left/right_descent()` for `weyl_group.py` to call `has_descent()`.\n\nAnyways, I've put my working version on trac at `u/tscrim/15456`. I also gave default implementations of `has_left/right_descent()` to `weyl_group.py` for speed. Although now that I've done the implementation, I'm less convinced of my suggestion. Perhaps what would be best is some category magic. We test upon creation of a Coxeter group to see if any of the methods have been implemented. Thus we do the following:\n\n- If `has_descent()` has been implemented, give default `has_*_descent()` call `has_descent()` with the appropriate args for those not implemented.\n- If none were implemented, error out on construction.\n- Otherwise set it up as we have it now.\n\nMaybe this is heavy-handed?\n\nNevertheless, here are some timings.

I don't like having the warning saying "don't override this", especially since I don't see  a good reason for doing this (and there's no "final" semantic in python). I am in favor of saying we must implement either `has_left_descent()` or `has_right_descent()`. Also possibly implementing has_left/right_descent()` for `weyl_group.py` to call `has_descent()`.

Anyways, I've put my working version on trac at `u/tscrim/15456`. I also gave default implementations of `has_left/right_descent()` to `weyl_group.py` for speed. Although now that I've done the implementation, I'm less convinced of my suggestion. Perhaps what would be best is some category magic. We test upon creation of a Coxeter group to see if any of the methods have been implemented. Thus we do the following:

- If `has_descent()` has been implemented, give default `has_*_descent()` call `has_descent()` with the appropriate args for those not implemented.
- If none were implemented, error out on construction.
- Otherwise set it up as we have it now.

Maybe this is heavy-handed?

Nevertheless, here are some timings. I'm using the example from the ticket description. Baseline:

```
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="left")
1000 loops, best of 3: 860 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="left")
1000 loops, best of 3: 820 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="right")
1000 loops, best of 3: 200 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="right")
1000 loops, best of 3: 209 us per loop
```

With Frederic's branch:

```
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="left")
1000 loops, best of 3: 987 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_left_descent(3)
1000 loops, best of 3: 929 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="right")
1000 loops, best of 3: 204 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_right_descent(3)
1000 loops, best of 3: 215 us per loop
```

With my branch:

```
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="left")
1000 loops, best of 3: 867 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_left_descent(3)
1000 loops, best of 3: 902 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_descent(3, side="right")
1000 loops, best of 3: 200 us per loop
sage: %timeit w.has_right_descent(3)
1000 loops, best of 3: 191 us per loop

So, what shall we do here ?

If I understand your proposal, when no `has_something` is implemented in an instance of Coxeter group, one has two different possibilities of infinite loop instead of one.

Supose now that I only implement `has_left` and that I call `has_right`. This will result in an infinite loop in your proposal, no ?
