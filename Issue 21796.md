# Issue 21796: Polynomials should support definite integration

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22033

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-12-06 21:03:32

Symbolic expressions support definite and indefinite integration:

```
sage: var('x')
x
sage: (x^3).integral(x)
1/4*x^4
sage: (x^3).integral(x, 0, 1)
1/4
```


Polynomials on the other hand support only indefinite integration:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: (x^3).integral(x)
1/4*x^4
sage: (x^3).integral(x, 0, 1)

Changing component from basic arithmetic to commutative algebra.

one should be more careful in the substitution to handle multivariate polynomials too

there is another method "integral" for singular polynomials that needs the same treatment
