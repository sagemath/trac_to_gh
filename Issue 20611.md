I think genus should be restricted to irreducible. The problem is not the difference between plane and not plane curves. You could have a curve with multiple components of different genus

eg: (y-x)(y<sup>2-x</sup>2-x-1)

I added an is_irreducible check which checks irreducibility by just counting irreducible components.

The new commit shows up in the log for this ticket but no notification seems to have been generated (I think because of the trac server change).

EDIT: actually the new commit shows up as part of this comment now

- Just checking the number of components for is_irreducible is not good enough. You're better off checking if the defining ideal is prime.


```
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
X=P.subscheme([x^2])
X.is_irreducible(),X.defining_ideal().is_prime()
```


- since the degree is just the dim! times the leading coefficient of HP, why not do it for projective subschemes instead of just curves?

- Adding an actual REF for Hartshorne would be nice.
