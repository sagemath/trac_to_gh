# Issue 17851: Inconsistency with 0^0

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18088

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2015-03-30 17:51:21

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/26374/evaluation-fail/).  Apparently Ginac says zero to the zero is undefined but most of the rest of Sage (in accordance with IEEE) says it is one.

Should such tickets be "sage-pending", since the upcoming pynac isn't (yet) on a Sage ticket (or maybe it is since I last looked)?  Just a procedure question, not a high priority question.
