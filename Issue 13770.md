# Issue 13770: MathJax and Documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: knsam

Original creation time: 2013-01-20 08:38:30

Assignee: was

Keywords: documentation, notebook, mathjax

The docstrings containing some math in them display oddly. The math is typeset, but enclosed by red \( and \). A way to reproduce this bug:

 1. pick any class that contains some mathematical symbols in its docstring (e.g. IntegerMatrices (of the combinat class), fibonacci).

 2. View the class description by saying `<classname>?`.

I'm not sure that I agree with the "blocker" status. I think blockers should really be bugs which prevent somebody from using Sage at all. That being said, if somebody can come up with a small patch fixing this, I don't mind making a sage-5.6.rc2.

This has been patched in sagenb 0.10.3. As such, it should be fixed by #13717. Please review that ticket.
