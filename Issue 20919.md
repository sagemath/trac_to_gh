# Issue 20919: AbstractLinearCode.dimension() is wrong if `_dimension` is not set

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21156

Keywords: linear code, beginner

The current implementation of `AbstractLinearCode.dimension()` simply accesses `self._dimension`. But there is no (longer a) requirement that this be set at construction time. The method should instead check if the special variable is set, and if it is not, compute the dimension as the number of rows in a generator matrix.

Added a note about the `_registered_encoder` that bruno ran into when writing the doc test.

Otherwise good, setting positive review.
