# Issue 17019: Explicit in the documentation that elliptic curves are plotted over the reals.

On [this ask question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/24666/why-elliptic-curve-plot-the-same-in-q-and-quadraticfield/) it has been reported that plotting an elliptic curve defined on a quadratic. Actually the plot method works on `RR` (if there is a natural coercion from the base ring of the curve to `RR`).

You should add a reference to the ticket using `:trac:`

I just tried something like:


```
        An elliptic curve defined over the Complex Field can not be plotted
        (see :trac:`17256`)::

            sage: E = EllipticCurve(CC, [0,0,1,-1,0])
            sage: E.plot()
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            NotImplementedError: Plotting of curves over Complex Field with 53 bits of precision not implemented yet
```


but i am not convinced it helps in understanding in any way, since this ticket does not fixes any particular bug, just notices an existing fact. The link to this trac ticket looks misleading. Do you have another way in mind ?

ok, I agree that the reference to trac is not very useful here. Good to go
