As the summary says. It may be good enough to move the targets `clean`, `sagelib-clean`, `build-clean`, `doc-clean`, `doc-src-clean`, and `doc-output-clean` from `build/make/deps` to the top-level `Makefile`.

I'm confused by the logic here. I think that the issues arise from these lines in `Makefile`:

```
# Defer unknown targets to build/make/Makefile
%::
	@if [ -x relocate-once.py ]; then ./relocate-once.py; fi
	$(MAKE) build/make/Makefile --stop
	+build/bin/sage-logger \
		"cd build/make && ./install '$@'" logs/install.log
```

So that's why I want to move the cleaning targets to the top-level `Makefile`. SAGE_LOCAL should be set by the `./configure` script, depending on the `--prefix` argument (for example), but we want `make distclean` to work regardless of whether `./configure` has been run. Part of `make distclean` already does `rm -rf local`. We have the following uses of `SAGE_` variables in the cleaning targets:
- `rm -rf "$(SAGE_LOCAL)/var/tmp/sage/build"`
- `cd "$(SAGE_SRC)" && (do some stuff)`
- `cd "$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/" && rm -rf build`
- `(cd "$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/pkgs/sage_docbuild/src" && rm -rf build)`
- `(cd "$(SAGE_ROOT)/build/pkgs/sage_setup/src" && rm -rf build)`
- `cd "$(SAGE_SRC)/doc" && $(MAKE) clean`

Moving the cleaning targets to the top-level Makefile could make sense.

Most of the above lines really don't need configured variables.

For cleaning within `SAGE_LOCAL` (and `SAGE_VENV`):

As you say, `make distclean` unconditionally removes all of `SAGE_ROOT/local`.  But if `--prefix` has been used to set `SAGE_LOCAL` to something else, that tree is not removed (and it should not; see discussion in #21775).

So it only matters what is to be done when `SAGE_LOCAL` has been set to something else.

To run a line such as `rm -rf "$(SAGE_LOCAL)/var/tmp/sage/build"`, we could try to source `SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-src-env-config`, which defines the configured `SAGE_LOCAL` and `SAGE_VENV`. If that fails (because `configure` has not run), do nothing.

I'm not sure about `rm -rf "$(SAGE_SHARE)/doc/sage"`. This not only removes build artifacts such as the inventory files, but it also uninstalls the built HTML documentation. I don't think this should be done by any target called `...-clean`.

Here is an attempt. A few comments:
- I added the line `if [ -d "$(SAGE_SRC)" ]; then \` because I kept making mistakes which resulted in `SAGE_SRC` not being set, and then the ensuing lines did things like `cd $(SAGE_SRC) && rm -rf build` which ended up being bad. So this is a safety net.
- The new target `doc-uninstall` is not currently used anywhere. Maybe it should be.

Oh, and I used `$(shell pwd)` when setting `SAGE_ROOT` because (with what I think is a non-GNU make on OS X) it was the only way I found to set `SAGE_ROOT` and have it expand immediately when being set. When I tried something like

```
SAGE_ROOT = $$(pwd)

clean-test:
    echo $(SAGE_ROOT)
```

then `make clean-test` would print

```
echo $(pwd)
/Users/palmieri/....
```

With the current version, if I add the same target `clean-test`, then `make clean-test` prints

```
echo /Users/...
/Users/...
```

It seems safest to have `SAGE_ROOT` defined once, not defined in terms of `pwd` which could change in the middle of a recipe.
