Tarball of pynormaliz 2.13 seems to be missing on the mirrors (Sorry if you already know, or if it is a question of time)

It is worse that: the checksum of the tarball from the link doesn't match this ticket.

Can you be more precices? Which checksum doesn't match?

If I download https://pypi.io/packages/source/p/pynormaliz/PyNormaliz-2.13.tar.gz

I get the same checksums as in this ticket.

I see, it doesn't match https://github.com/Normaliz/PyNormaliz/releases/tag/v2.13.

I don't know, why this would be different.

That probably is the issue as Volker likely pulled from the link to the mirrors.
