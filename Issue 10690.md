From https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/3UqXw-Bugx8/discussion. This is actually a bug in matplotlib (see the thread) and we should either backport their change or upgrade the matplotlib spkg when the next stable version is released.

The sage-support discussion in the ticket description

- mentions a problem observed in Sage 4.6.1 which had matplotlib 1.0.0
- says the problem is fixed in further versions of matplotlib

We are now using matplotlib 3.3.

All we need is a doctest for the problem in this ticket.
