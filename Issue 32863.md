# Issue 32863: is_positive_definite returns wrong results

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33100

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2021-12-31 16:05:36

CC:  mjo

For some double dense matrices that are not positive definite, Sage incorrectly claims that they are:

    {{{
    sage: A = matrix(CDF, [This is the Trac macro *1+I* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1+I-macro))
    sage: A.is_positive_definite()  # should be False
    True
    sage: A.is_positive_semidefinite()  # correct
    False
    }}}

Clearly, `A` is not even Hermitian. The implementation relies on testing whether a Cholesky decomposition exists or not, but `.cholesky()` gives an incorrect result for this matrix

    {{{
    sage: A.cholesky()
    [1.0]
    }}}

while for most other matrices this would raise an error.

The [SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.cholesky.html) is not entirely clear about this, but it seems that SciPy assumes that the matrix is already Hermitian positive-definite and thus only considers half the matrix (see [SciPy issues 2116](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2116#issuecomment-990487066) and [15012](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15012)). Therefore, Sage needs to check at least whether the matrix is Hermitian before calling `scipy.linalg.cholesky`, but it is not clear from the Scipy documentation whether that is enough to determine positive-definiteness.

This also fails for larger matrices, such as these linear combinations of positive definite matrices (for many seeds):


```
sage: set_random_seed(0)
sage: random_pd_matrix = lambda n: (B := matrix.random(CDF, n)) * B.H
sage: r = 2  # 2 or larger
sage: n = 3  # 1 or larger
sage: As = [random_pd_matrix(n) for j in range(r)]
sage: C = random_pd_matrix(r)
sage: A = sum(sum(C[i,j] for i in range(r)) * As[j] for j in range(r))
sage: A.is_positive_definite()  # should usually be False
True
sage: A.is_positive_semidefinite()  # correct, but pd would imply psd
False
sage: A.is_hermitian(tol=1e-6)  # correct, but pd would imply Hermitian
False
```

My first thought was that we should be able to delete `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` in the subclass to obtain something possibly slower, but that actually works. There are two small problems though.

First, the generic `cholesky()` doesn't work on the trivial matrix, breaking one doctest (#33107). This is an easy fix.

Second, the subclass implementation of `is_hermitian()` used by the superclass's `is_cholesky()` doesn't work out-of-the box. For example,


```
sage: M = matrix(RDF,[[ 1,  1,    1,     1,     1],                 
....:                 [ 1,  5,   31,   121,   341],                 
....:                 [ 1, 31,  341,  1555,  4681],                 
....:                 [ 1,121, 1555,  7381, 22621],                 
....:                 [ 1,341, 4681, 22621, 69905]])
M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal') # the default
False
```


while


```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='orthonormal', tol=1e-10)
True
```


or


```
sage: M.is_hermitian(algorithm='naive')
True
```


We'd have to either tweak the default tolerance there, or again maybe just delete the subclass method. The "naive" algorithm now defers to a superclass implementation where the default tolerance works.

Rather than remove the subclass `is_hermitian()`, I've only switched its default to the "naive" algorithm. (But note that I don't think it's any more naive than "orthonormal"). Afterwards, eliminating `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` from the subclass allows the superclass methods to return the correct result.

I agree with using the "naive" algorithm here and do not see why it would be more naive/less appropriate than the "orthonormal" one. For the orthonormal algorithm, no tolerance would be large enough to work for all such matrices that are Hermitian in an exact sense, when considered entrywise. Scipy 1.8.0 will also have a function [scipy.linalg.ishermitian](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.ishermitian.html) which works like the naive algorithm, i.e. entrywise.

I am a bit hesitant to replace a Scipy implementation by a pure Sage implementation. Upstream has confirmed [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/2116#issuecomment-1003690573) that `scipy.linalg.cholesky` essentially first constructs a Hermitian matrix by only considering the given triangular information of the matrix, ignoring the other half. So if we first check whether the matrix is Hermitian in `.cholesky()`, we will obtain a valid Cholesky decomposition.

This would make `is_positive_definite` work as intended by the implementation. Though, it would in most cases produce the same result as `is_positive_semidefinite`, as a Cholesky decomposition can exist for semidefinite matrices, but for matrices that are actually singular this can easily fail. Is there an intended difference between these methods? Perhaps debatable, but from a usage point of view I would expect something like
- `is_positive_definite` = all eigenvalues strictly positive (or `> tolerance`)
- `is_positive_semidefinite` = all eigenvalues `> -tolerance`
(implemented in a numerically sane way).

Yeah, the subclass should be doing that anyway, since the superclass does it. (Users shouldn't see different qualitative behaviors from a method when you change the underlying representation of the matrix's entries.) I haven't checked but scipy is almost certainly faster even though I did my best to make it fast in sage. On the other hand, it's nice not to have copy & pasted the entire method's documentation.

The superclass `cholesky()` and `is_*definite()` methods support both exact and inexact rings in a numerically stable way (caveat: `is_hermitian()` itself is not yet reliable, that's #33053) via `block_ldlt()`. For inexact rings, positive-definite and positive-semidefinite are indeed basically the same up to machine precision, but the tests use `> 0` and `>= 0`.

Unless you strongly prefer otherwise, I tend towards staying with using Scipy for the Cholesky decomposition.

Ok, dropping `is_positive_definite` from the subclass sounds good to me then, as then the `is_*definite` methods are at least based on the same implementation (as numerically the distinction between these methods is not so relevant).

I left `is_positive_definite()` alone because `cholesky()` and `is_positive_definite()` cache one another in the subclass. Using the superclass for `is_positive_definite()` would cache a `block_ldlt()` factorization, but then it would not be used for `cholesky()`.

For some reason, I did not receive an email notification for comment 11. Also, this does not seem so useful without knowing which of the three dozen tickets causes a merge conflict, so I have to wait for the new beta anyway. It would be more helpful if the CI identifies merge conflicts between positively reviewed tickets, so that one can resolve conflicts before it even gets any attention by the release manager.

```diff
-                # avoid abs() which is missing for finite fields.
-                if d > tolerance or -d > tolerance:
+                # abs() support is spotty
+                if (d*d.conjugate()).sqrt() > tolerance:
```

I am not completely sure about theses changes. Square roots do not always exist in the same field, such as cyclotomic fields for which `sqrt` returns a result in `SR`. Granted, this probably did not work before either, as comparisons are broken in number fields (#20028).

For finite fields, the [documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/226937dfa9b8b335e873c3c65a796ae1b0924ff2/src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_givaro.pyx#L1314-L1316) advises against relying on comparisons as well. Though, technically they should work in our case, i.e. if the integer representation of a finite field element is compared to a tolerance of 0.

It might be better to explicitly check whether `d` is equal to zero when the tolerance is zero.

This lurking doubt is what kept me from setting it back to needs_review right away. A priori we could square both sides to avoid roots, but I still have some questions. For the moment, a lot of this stuff is broken in corner cases anyway, so I don't feel too bad about making incremental but imperfect improvements so long as they don't hurt any existing use cases.

But for finite fields I think you're right, and I vaguely remember coming to the same conclusion. If the fields are exact, the tolerance should be zero unless you override it, and it's only by accident that the comparison works but it does work. If a tolerance is given, though, I'm not even sure what the user could expect to happen.
