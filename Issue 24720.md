Keywords: interfaces

There are some areas in some of the interface classes that directly look in the `spawn.before` and `spawn.after` buffers (which contain `bytes`), and then we need to wrap those with `bytes_to_str`.

There was already an `Expect._before()` method which simply returned `self._expect.before`, and was only used in a few places for some reason.  We reuse that existing method, however, to provide a version that also wraps `bytes_to_str()`, allowing us to avoid some explicit `bytes_to_str()` calls.

Also added a similar `Expect._after()` method.

looks good but the doc formatting could be enhanced:

* ``str`` should rather be ```str```

* ``sage.misc.cpython.bytes_to_str`` should be a link
