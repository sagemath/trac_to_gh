# Issue 3352: slight inconsistency in the dsage documentation

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/3352

Assignee: tba

In Section 16.2 of the Reference Manual, the command DSage for Distributed Sage is out of date; the new command seems to be dsage (all lower case).

As of Sage 4.3.1, ticket #7975 removed dsage from the standard spkg repository. I'm closing this ticket as invalid.
