Keywords: py3, graph

We clean methods related to
- clustering: `cluster_triangles`, `clustering_average`, `clustering_coeff`, `cluster_transitivity`
- centrality: `centrality_betweenness`, `centrality_closeness`
- paths and distances:  `distance`, `distance_all_pairs`, `eccentricity`, `radius`, `diameter`, `center`, `distance_graph`, `girth`, `periphery`,  `all_paths`, `triangles_count`, `shortest_path`, `shortest_path_length`, `_check_weight_function`, `shortest_paths`, `_path_length`, `shortest_path_lengths`, `shortest_path_all_pairs`, `wiener_index`, `average_distance`, `szeged_index`

Apart from PEP8 cleaning, the main changes are:
- in `cluster_triangles`, we add parameter `implementation` to use faster methods than networkx. We also remove parameter `with_labels` that was neither documented nor used.

- in `eccentricity`: add parameter `vertex_list` to method `eccentricity` of `distances_all_pairs.pyx`. This way we save some calls to `.vertices`. We also fix an error in the ordering of returned values (a doctest was false...).

- `radius`, `center`, `periphery`: replace the long description of the list of algorithm by a forward to method eccentricity

- avoid using `.vertices` and `.edges` without `sort=False` in all these methods except `eccentricity` that uses the default ordering of `.vertices` when no list of vertices is specified.

I have split this ticket into many smaller and independent tickets. Should be easier to review.

So this ticket becomes a meta-ticket for this group of methods of `generic_graph.py`.
