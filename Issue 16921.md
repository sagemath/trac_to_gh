# Issue 16921: Remove some functions from sage/misc/functional.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-10-15 08:37:25

Some functions in `functional.py` aren't used or are duplicated in `sage/functions`. Fix this.

I'm keeping the `log()` function for now because it is imported globally as `log_b` and it is actually used in the Sage library in various places.

So you're saying that a lot of the removed functions aren't imported globally?  But you are removing a lot of global imports - where do they live instead?  I have a feeling that at least for a few of the symbolic ones there was a reason for having this last-ditch place for them.

Also, I notice some other cleanup that is not related to this (e.g. in monoids), which seems odd.

Most of them can either be called as methods (`a.exp()` instead of `exp(a)`) or imported from a different place (usually in `sage.functions` or `sage.structure` in the case of `parent()`).

I don't know what it could be... in any case all doctests pass without them.

I had to move that import to break a cyclic import loop.

Hmm, indeed apparently some of these imports are redundant and/or wiped out, e.g.`exp??` gives the source from sage.functions.log.

I stumbled over this ticket because I noticed the same issue. Looks fine and passes `make ptestlong`.
