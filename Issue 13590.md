See this [sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/dGtkGWYlI-k/discussion).
I should have opened the bug report here. This is a clear blocker for 5.5.

See also #11409, in particular the [scripts patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/11409/11409_scripts.patch).

I remember having tried only the scripts patch. It didn't work unfortunately. Only the error message changed.

Maybe we also need this change to `sage-notebook` and `sage-notebook-insecure`:

```diff
diff --git a/sage-notebook b/sage-notebook
--- a/sage-notebook
+++ b/sage-notebook
`@``@` -6,6 +6,7 `@``@` print open(os.environ['SAGE_ROOT'] + '/l
 
 print "Please wait while the Sage Notebook server starts..."
 
+from sage.all import *
 from sagenb.notebook.all import notebook
 
 print "..."
```

Please try the scripts patch from #11409 again. I'm attaching it here and making this ticket a prerequisite for #11409, since it is hard to predict when a new sagenb spkg might be ready, so it's hard to predict when #11409 might get merged.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Ok. This patch works by itself with the nb in 5.5rc0. Thanks for the fix.

Can you do the following:
1. change the name of the patch - it has the wrong ticket number.
2. change the commit message.

I would give it a positive review otherwise.
