That too but I think either `SR(f)` or `diff(f,t)` should work even with `NewSymbolicFunction`. If not improve the error message.

However, having `diff(f,t)` a shortcut for `diff(f(t),t)` is less useful because the other instances of `f` in the argument to `desolve` would still have to be coerced. And it is impossible to know what is the variable there.

I'd say no. This would be significant feature creep into the interface of `diff`.

I am a little worried about

```
sage: diff(f,x,x)
D[0, 0](f)(x, x) + 2*D[0, 1](f)(x, x) + D[1, 1](f)(x, x)
```

where almost certainly a user who would type this would be hoping for

```
D[0, 0](f)(x)
```

I think the ambiguity in meaning when multiple arguments are given makes it safer to disallow it altogether.

I wouldn't mind if we wouldn't support this at all, but if we do, I recommend that we only allow repetition of a single argument variable, and interpret it as the n-th derivative of a univariate function evaluated at that argument

}
```

With Sage develop:

```
sage: t = var('t')
sage: sage: f = function('f')(t)
sage: diff(f,x,x)
0
sage: desolve(diff(f,t) - (f+1)/(t+1), f)
(_C - 1/(t + 1))*(t + 1)

sage: sage: f = function('f')
sage: diff(f,t) 
...
TypeError: unable to convert f to a symbolic expression
sage: diff(sin,t)
...
TypeError: unable to convert sin to a symbolic expression
```

So an error does only happen with anonymous functions (`NewSymbolicFunction`) and bare `Function` objects.

With this branch there is

```
sage: diff(sin,t)
cos(t)
sage: diff(f,t)
diff(f(t), t)
sage: diff(f,x,x)
D[0, 0](f)(x, x) + 2*D[0, 1](f)(x, x) + D[1, 1](f)(x, x)
```

of which the latter has to be improved according to Nils.

I'd say the first ones need to be improved as well: if `diff(sin,t)==cos(t)` then `diff` apparently evaluates `sin` at `t` and then differentiates it. I think it's very confusing to let `diff` evaluate its argument.
For instance, if `f=(x^2).function(x)` then `f` is callable, so extending the above definition would give `diff(f,t)==diff(t^2,t)=2*t`. Instead, we have the perfectly acceptable `diff(f,t)== (0*x).function(x)`: `f` is perfectly understood to be a function in `x`, and hence differentiating with respect to `t` would involve the derivative of `x` wrt. `t`, and `x` is not indicated to depend on `t`.

Having derivatives of functions with anonymous argument with respect to a named variable result in error seems desirable to me and that's the current behaviour.

So I'd advocate for closing this ticket as "notabug/wontfix".
