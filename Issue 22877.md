CC:  @culler @NathanDunfield @slel

Keywords: PHCpack, numerical, polynomial system

Upgrade the PHCpack interface phc.py to use phcpy, a new Python package that replaces file parsing with a persistent shared object. Replace the input and output strings with proper [SageMath](SageMath) objects, and build a class system around them.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23114
