# Issue 22877: Update PHCpack interface

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jsommars

Original creation time: 2017-05-31 12:52:49

CC:  culler dunfield slelievre

Keywords: PHCpack, numerical, polynomial system

Upgrade the PHCpack interface phc.py to use phcpy, a new Python package that replaces file parsing with a persistent shared object. Replace the input and output strings with proper [SageMath](SageMath) objects, and build a class system around them.
