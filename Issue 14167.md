These are all true statements, but what's the point you're trying to make?

Perhaps you are confused by the use of `sys.exc_info()[2]`, which allows to raise a new exception with the old traceback. So it really is the `os.write()` which is failing.

Known bug? This is from `pexpect.py`:

```
    def isalive(self):
        """This tests if the child process is running or not.
        This is non-blocking. If the child was terminated then this
        will read the exitstatus or signalstatus of the child.
        This returns 1 if the child process appears to be running or 0 if not.
        It can take literally SECONDS for Solaris to return the right status.
        """
```

How about we wait for 5 seconds after an `os.write` error on Slowaris?

I was more thingking about that:

```
    except OSError, msg:

            # OpenSolaris bug workaround
            time.sleep(5)

```

There is no point in waiting if your OS works correctly. But more importantly, does it fix the issue?

True, but I don't like special-casing operating systems. How can we be certain that it only affects (Open)Solaris? Since this failure (`OSError` when the process is truly alive) essentially never happens, I don't think it is a problem. On sane systems, this doesn't affect the doctest since those `time.sleep()` calls will not be done as `E.isalive()` is false.
