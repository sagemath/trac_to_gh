With default arguments the `random_digraph` method fails with a zero division:

```
sage: random_digraph(3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

Attachment

The problem seems to be the default argument for p in random_digraph.  The attached patch fixes this.

You need at least to provide the number of vertices `:-)`

Hello,

There are certainly historical and practical reasons, but I don't understand why the sandpile module contains graphs generators instead of using directly graphs/digraphs.
I think it would make more sense to add weighted versions to the random GNP generator of the graph module (same for random trees, etc.).

David.

Same for me on `5.9.beta1`.
