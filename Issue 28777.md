# Issue 28777: cvxopt: use pkg-config for blas libdir in spkg-install

This ticket sets Blas and GSL variables in the spkg-install file for Cvxopt using pkg-config to allow for non-standard locations of Openblas, as with Homebrew on macOS (see [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/91e0GfHT-Yo/4gVjPNQGCgAJ)).

I am not completely sure this is how it should be done, as I am not very familiar with pkg-config, but this works on my end using Openblas and GSL from Homebrew.
