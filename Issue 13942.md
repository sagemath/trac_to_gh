Thanks Charles, this is very good to have!

A comment and a question:

* The doctest with output "doctest:311" will likely break later on. Better is to write "doctest:..." in the output.

* Why an error in one situation and a warning in another? Why not a warning in both? You are disallowing some functionality with the error, as seen from the following in an unpatched Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2 + 3)
sage: c = b + b
sage: c^2 == -12/5
True
sage: c^2 == b
False
```


* There is a discrepancy between the absolute and the relative case. With your patch on Sage 5.7:

```
sage: k.<a> = NumberField(5*x^2+3)
NotImplementedError: number fields for non-monic polynomials not yet implemented.
sage: k.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: l.<b> = k.extension(5*x^2+3)
ValueError: the polynomial must be monic
```

I prefer the `NotImplementedError`, and it would be good to add a reference to #252 to that error message.

> I did not touch the absolute case.

Fine with me. I looked at this in a bit more detail, and have some questions:

* Why import "warn" from "sage.misc.superseded" and not directly from Python's "warnings" module as is done in `superseded.py`?

* When I try the examples in a Sage session, I get the warning printed twice. Is that supposed to happen?

I did some of the corrections myself that I did not get an answer to:

* "..." instead of a doctest number
* `NotImplementedError`, because it is more appropriate than `ValueError` and also more in line with the absolute case
* import `warn` more directly

However, I still don't understand why I get the warning printed twice:
