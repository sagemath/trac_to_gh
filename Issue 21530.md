In this branch :
* Sage shell checking
* verbose compilation
* patching (and empty patches directory), [Sage Maintainer's Guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#patching-sources) style.

This builds and passes the package's own test suite without errors ; the resulting Sage passes ptestlong with the usual transient error on `simplicial_complex.py`, which passes succesfully standalone.

Anyway, the point is moot for now : there are **no** patches...

Care to explain ? I'm a dentist of very little mind, and have trouble following you.

I think that the (pseudo-)legal considerations which motivated last month's [saga](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/QaBdHSNJuKg) leave us few options.

I looked a bit closer to the idea of using an `rpy2`-based new interface to an external `R`. This is doable, but not in the short term.

I am under the impression that the current (pexpect) interface won't work reliably with a system R (especially on "exotic" systems such as cygwin and the Mac). Therefore, depending on a systemwide installation for R is out of the question in the short term. We need an interim solution.

My current plan is :
* Mark this ticket (#21767) as invalid/won't fix, forthe (pseudo-)legal reasons discussed in the saga.
* Document in the REAME.md and various places in the [Installation guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html) that **Sage** depends on `libcurl` and building it depends on `libcurl`'s development files.
* Make `xz` (existing package) and `pcre` (proposed new package) standard packages (see #21744 and #21770 respectively).
* patch the `R install-spkg` to test for the existence and correct capabilities of libcurl before starting to install ; display an explicitly Sage-centered message and fail if not found / not correct.
* make `R` depend on `xz` and `pcre`

Only *after* this interim solution works, envision the much larger task of creating a new interface.

Jean-Pierre : I think that omitting `https` requirement for R is a *very* bad idea : I do not know how longer R users will be able to depend on http-only repositories ; and, as I said before, R practical use is highly dependent of access to the 9000+ R packages in existence.

Advice required. Do you think useful to open an new discussion on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-devel) ?

Note 1 : the patchbot test of #21744 is marked "pending". What does that mean ?

Note 2 : the patchbot test of #21770 fails repeatedly due to thye source tarball being unavailable on Sage standard repositories. What should I do ? The (ftp) address of the original tarball is in the ticket's header.

And that's why Sage's pip, compiled on a VM without OpenSSL, is unusable. "Reduced functionality", indeed...

> I think that can and should be done for R also.

That should be done **upstream** :
* in R (the R Core Team introduced the SSL requirement with R 3.3 after having maintained an internal library for years...) ;
* in Python (which explicitly depends on OpenSSL).

But I really think that this is weather-fighting (and a rearguard fight, BTW). You still have to convince us that OpenSSL drawbacks (what are they ?) are worth committing a large part of our limited resources to work around it.

Anyway, sorry for reviving this here as curl can build without ssl.
