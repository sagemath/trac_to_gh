python distutils requires a lot of overhead in file lists, which is bad. but wildcards are worse.

*Still, these are philosophical objections, and as such you may disagree, or find enough value in wildcards to dismiss all of them. Before you start writing a patch against Automake to teach it about wildcards, let’s see the main technical issue: portability.*

You can guess where I fall :). 

Portability is not an issue here. The main downside is someone might forget to add/commit the file, but here this is no worse than we are with .py files, and I would say that this inconsistency is bad (.pyx files should be as similar to .py files as possible).

Replying to [comment:15 robertwb]:
> Would you propose enumerating the .py files somewhere as an enhancement? 


yes.

when i implemented the make/autotools based build system (#15039), i started off with wildcards (which are not a portability issue, since GNU make is a requirement in various other places). only later, i considered integrity/sanity more important than having random files processed/installed/distributed. so I switched over to explicit lists.

unlike distutils, autotools provides some integrity checks ('distcheck') out of the box, i didn't want to miss them. i cant help to note that enhancing/replacing distutils would be far superior to getting rid of the existing file lists.

autotools (in combination with GNU make) works with wildcards, but it will not end up smarter than distutils with wildcards. reliable introspection should not be used to decide which files belong to a project.

sage (the library) has tests for every implemented function, no matter how trivisl it is. not checking whether all files are present does not seem to fit. if you are not convinced, go ahead and delete the lists.
