This happens because in `traveling_salesman_problem` the call to `_scream_is_not_simple` raises a `ValueError` when the graph is not simple, and the same exception is raised when the graph is not hamiltonian.

We can use the `EmptySetError` to differentiate them, as we cannot optimize anything on an empty set.

Hi Nathann,

Why not a `NonImplementedError` (with a shorter message)?

Because I am not sure that `_scream_if_not_simple` should always raise a NotImplementedError in all functions that call it.

What is the problem with long messages ? They give more meaningful information.
