Keywords: thursdaysbdx; jupyter nbconvert

The following instructions to convert a ipynb file to a hmtl slides presentations works:


```
sage -ipython nbconvert filename.ipynb --to slides 
[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | Subcommand `ipython nbconvert` is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
[TerminalIPythonApp] WARNING | You likely want to use `jupyter nbconvert` in the future
```



When you try to use the new method, you get an error message:


```
sage -jupyter nbconvert filename.ipynb --to slides
sage-run received unknown option: -jupyter
usage: sage [options]
Try 'sage -h' for more information.
```

Original summary of this ticket: "jupyter nbconvert unknown option"

It's not that `jupyter nbconvert` is not known, it's that we don't provide
`sage --jupyter` (we should!).

I wouldn't say it's a defect. It's just not a feature that exists in the command-line interface.  You can run any shell command in Sage's environment with `sage -sh <whatever>`.  But I agree it would be a useful one to exist.

I've actually been thinking again lately about how to redesign Sage's command-line interface (both the UI and the implementation) but that's not a new subject, and it's pretty low priority.  Adding a new flag for a specific executable is not a big deal though.
