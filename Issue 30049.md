This is ready for review, but we need #30277 to be done so that #30240 can go.

`"Linst-Schrijver graph"` should be `"van Lint-Schrijver graph"`
(Dutch names with `van` have `v`, while Flemish have `V`, and `van` must not be skipped :-))

this was not quite fixed, I still see `LintSchrijver` instead of `vanLintSchrijver` in `graphs.*`
