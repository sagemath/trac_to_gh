As discussed in the earlier ticket about the finite ring, we must show that R has an identity and that every non-zero element of R is a unit.

Let's make it more clear with the help of an example: Suppose that R has n elements. 
let a1, a2, a3 ..., an be the distinct elements of R. Let a belongs to R, a = 0. 
Now, aai belongs top all I, so
{aa1, aa2, ..., aan} is a subset of R

If aai = aaj, then ai = aj 
Therefore, the elements aa1, aa2, ..., aan must be distinct. 

We know that R has only n elements, it follows that 
R = {aa1, aa2., ...,aan}
This implies that a belongs to {aa1, aa2, ..., aan}. 
So from this we conclude that one of the products must be equal to a, 
Let aai = a

Since R is commutative, we also have a1a = a.

We show that ai is the identity of R. Let b be any element of R.

Then b belongs to {aa1, aa2, ...,aan}

So there exists 
aj belongs to R such that b = aaj
Thus,
bai = aib   (since R is commutative)
    = ai(aai)  (substitution for b)
    = (aia)aj
    = aaj
    = b

=> ai is the identity of R and we denote the identity of R by I

I belongs to R = {aa1, aa2, ..., aan}
from this one of the products lets aak = 1
Using the commutative property,
aka = aak = 1
So we conclude that every non-zero element is a unit and hence R is a field.

I have taken the reference of ticket #20387 and then jotted down certain particulars

This ticket is based on a misunderstanding of #20387, and should therefore be closed as invalid.

It is unfortunately not true that every finite ring is a field. (For example, if `n` is not prime, then the ring `Z_n` of integers modulo `n` is not a field.) The problem with the proof in the ticket description is that it assumes the cancellation law ("If `a ai = a aj`, then `ai = aj`"), but this is not true if the ring is not an integral domain.

A solution to #20387 would add an error message when one of the functions mentioned there is called with a finite ring that is not a field.

Ok so we can conclude that not every finite ring but every finite alternate division ring is a field.
