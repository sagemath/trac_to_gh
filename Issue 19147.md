# Issue 19147: Type B rigged configuration bijection doesn't work when spinor is not the only leftmost factor

Keywords: rigged configurations

The following breaks:

```
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['B',3,1], [[3,1],[3,1]])
sage: RC._test_bijection()
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['B',3,1], [[1,1],[3,1],[1,1]])
sage: RC._test_bijection()
```

This is because we don't keep the vacancy numbers when converting back from the A<sub>2n-1</sub><sup>(2)</sup> rigged configurations and instead recompute them based upon the original dimensions (because we abuse the elements and work with a mutating copy of them to avoid creating numerous temporary parents).
