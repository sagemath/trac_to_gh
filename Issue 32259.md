LGTM.

Side Question: Do you think we should just add a `__deepcopy__` in `Element` that just calls `__copy__`? Very few things (if any) would probably implement a distinct `__deepcopy__`.

We could try that, but `Element.__copy__` is explicitly a shallow copy (attribute by attribute), so it feels a bit undisciplined.

I would still favor making a set of mix-in classes that specify the mutability semantics, something like `Mutable`, `Immutable`, `DeeplyImmutable`.
I think as long as mix-in classes do not define new attributes or new methods that would need to go in the vtable, there's no problem with mix-ins for extension classes, but I might be remembering this wrong.
