Keywords: poset

I propose to implement another algorithm, which seems to be slightly faster than the existing implementation, at the cost of being defined on antichains instead of order ideals.

```
sage: P = Posets.ChainPoset(5)  
sage: Q = P.product(P)          
sage: Q.order_ideals_lattice()
Finite lattice containing 252 elements
sage: new_J(Q)
Finite lattice containing 252 elements
sage: new_J(Q).is_isomorphic(Q.order_ideals_lattice())
True
sage: timeit('Q.order_ideals_lattice()')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.25 s per loop
sage: timeit('new_J(Q)')                 
5 loops, best of 3: 3.45 s per loop
```

This patch is good to go, but why is there a poset file in categories/ while most of the poset stuff seems to be in combinat/posets ? `O_o`
