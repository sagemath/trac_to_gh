For reasons I don't understand (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/r7Q7XpL_bgY/1P7BOYzNBgAJ), with Python 2, the different functions `ZpLC(2)`, `ZpLF(2)`, and a few others all produce deprecation warnings when run at the command line, but there is just a single deprecation warning (printed for the first function and not the rest) when running doctests. With Python 3, the behavior is the same for doctests and at the command line.

ok, good enough for the moment, even if it only cures symptoms

Do we need to undo this change? This is now failing for me, maybe because of the upgrade in the version of Python 3.

Never mind, it's working for me now. I don't know what was going on before.
