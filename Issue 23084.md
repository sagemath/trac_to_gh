I think this is a really useful addition for user friendliness, this approach feels a lot more natural to me.

A couple of not too serious concerns I have that I'd love to hear other peoples opinions about:

1. Some more things could be implemented, like `additive_order` for elements would be useful.

2. There is quite a stark difference between the prime and non-prime case (related to 1.) how accepted is it to have the type of the output depend so much on a non-trivial property of the input?
