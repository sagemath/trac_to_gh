For slightly better grammar, the pattern `see :wikipedia:something` could be replaced with `see the :wikipedia:something` which results in "see the Wikipedia article something" rather than just "see Wikipedia article something". Also, the `:wikipedia:` template ought to be edited to include a colon or the word "on" as well but that should be another ticket.
