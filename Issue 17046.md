Keywords: modular symbols dimension

In the following example, two ways of computing the dimension of a space of modular symbols do not give the same result:

```
sage: k.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: G = DirichletGroup(192)
sage: chi = G([i,-1,-1])
sage: M = ModularSymbols(chi);
sage: M.cuspidal_submodule()
AssertionError: According to dimension formulas the cuspidal subspace of "Modular Symbols space of dimension 0 and level 192, weight 2, character [zeta4, 1, -1], sign 0, over Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2" has dimension 40; however, computing it using modular symbols we obtained 0, so there is a bug (please report!).

Just a little remark, we could fail faster in case the list of images does not have the right length (in case the orders are not automatically precomputed when Z/nZ is created, I don't remember).
And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Could you add a little more about the necessary orders either in the INPUT section or in the TESTS one (that is say more than the orders are not admissible).

The current error string formulation also kind of make it feel like the orders must be exactly the one stated.

The unit group of Z/nZ is computed (generators and orders) when the Dirichlet group is constructed.
> And that does not really matters anyway as feeding it with wrong length of images is just asking for trouble.

Indeed, it is better to optimise for the case where the input is valid.
