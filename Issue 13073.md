With the attached patch, passing the argument `-N` to `sage -clone` says not to rebuild the reference manual. The patch also uses the option during the clone in the `sage-combinat` script: there are usually so many patches applied in the queue, it would make more sense to build the manual after applying the patches, not before.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13245

Oh, forgot:  Cython-generated header files (`*.h`) don't contain a special comment on that on the first line (which is probably an upstream Cython bug), so the following currently doesn't work as expected either:

```python
            if ext in ['.h', '.c', '.cpp']:
                if 'Cython' in open(src + '/' + F).readline():
                    os.link(src + '/' + F, dest + '/' +F)
                    os.utime(dest + '/' +F, None)
```


(For the moment, we could look for `^#ifndef __PYX_HAVE__sage__` in those, probably even without the `sage__`.)

Yes, but it also triggers the rebuild of (currently) at least one *other* Cython module (besides the newly generated five `sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_*.pyx`):

```
...
Building interpreters for fast_callable
Updating Cython code....
Compiling sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.pyx because it depends on ./sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd.
...
building 'sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface' extension
...
```


(I think we could just copy over *all* files in `sage/ext/interpreters/`, which is in `.hgignore`.)

Note sure what or whether doc-rebuilding is triggered (upon next `sage --docbuild ...`) by rebuilding the interpreters though.




Could you explain why we "touch" almost all manually copied (more precisely, linked) files?




> Leif, would you like to be listed as an author?

Does the patch introduce new environment variables? :P

I'm having another header file in the original but not the clone:

`sage/rings/complex_double_api.h`, which starts with

```c
#ifndef __PYX_HAVE_API__sage__rings__complex_double

static struct __pyx_obj_4sage_5rings_14complex_double_ComplexDoubleElement *(*__pyx_f_4sage_5rings_14complex_double_new_ComplexDoubleElement)(void) = 0;

#define __PYX_HAVE_RT_ImportModule
```


(and is explicitly listed in `.hgignore`).

I couldn't find any places where this is actually used though, nor do I know where it originates from.

Although it looks Cython-generated, it doesn't get recreated when I touch `complex_double*` sources.

It *seems*<sup>TM</sup> to be some left-over file we still ship, despite it being in `.hgignore`; the file date is July 9th 2012...

So it apparently doesn't matter whether we copy / link it or not, but I feel a bit uncomfortable.

Hmmm, did some testing, and it seems copying over any already built documentation doesn't make sense (or doesn't work as expected at least).

I've made sure that the documentation (and the Sage library) is up-to-date, but if I run `sage --docbuild reference html` afterwards in a fresh clone, apparently *everything* (of the reference manual) gets rebuilt.

It says

```
[foo] building [html]: targets for N source files that are out of date
[foo] updating environment: 0 added, N changed, 0 removed
...
```

for all components AFAICS.

(This is with 5.10.rc0.)

I meant that we should either drop copying over any "pre-built" documentation (since it doesn't work -- there's apparently no difference to building all from scratch), or fix rebuilding [all of it].

Since we both seem to be unable to do (or don't want to spend time on) the latter, I think we should go with the former.

? I don't understand what you mean by that; `$SAGE_ROOT/devel/sage-main/doc/output/...` at least is always there.

I don't see why cloning should vanish with the switch to git.

a) If you had committed changes to the main repo, you should of course run `sage -b` before cloning.  (It would be better to test with a vanilla Sage library.)

b) Are you sure *everything* (= *all* extension modules) got rebuilt, as opposed to just changed modules and those that depend on the changed ones (the latter potentially being many, even if not many got changed)?

c) Is that a regression?

(The current brokenness of `sage -sync-build` *might* be related, although I don't see that `sage -combinat` calls it.)

The messages don't seem to be in chronological order (probably `stdout` and `stderr` out of sync); I somehow doubt all extension modules got rebuilt if "re-cythonizing" took just 33 seconds...

There are no changes to `sage -sync-build` yet.

Here's a log from calling `sage -b main` afterwards (because I stupidly overwrote the first log).

I *think<sup>TM</sup>* I know what the problem might be, namely the *order* in which subdirectories of `devel/sage/build/` are copied.

Since the odd addition of `build_dir` in `setup.py`, which already breaks `sage-sync-build`, the Cython-generated `.c` and `.cpp` files also end up below `build/`.

Now if these get copied (and touched!) **after** their corresponding `.o` and `.so` files, the latter will get rebuilt.




Travis, could you switch back to the main branch, remove the line setting `build_dir` from `setup.py` (or change `build_dir='build/cythonized'` to `build_dir=None`), do `sage -b` to get a clean new main repo, and retry your test? B)

With

```python
def copy_dtree(src_dir, dest_dir):
    src_root = os.path.abspath(src_dir)
    dest_root = os.path.abspath(dest_dir)

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src_root):
        nroot = dest_root + root[len(src_root):]
        for d in dirs:
            os.makedirs(nroot+'/'+d)
        for f in files:
            if os.path.splitext(f)[1] in [".c",".cpp",".o",".so"]: # ADDED
                print("  %s" % f) # ADDED

sys.stdout.flush(); sys.stderr.flush() # ADDED
print "Copying over build directory..."
copy_dtree('sage/build', branch + '/build')
sys.stdout.flush(); sys.stderr.flush() # ADDED
```

I can at least confirm that *for me* all `.o` and `.so` files get copied *after* all `.c` and `.cpp` files have been copied -- rather incidentally I think.

At least the `.cython_version` part here.

And we should really disable (postpone) Cython-generated files "out-of-tree", since this breaks both `sage-clone` and `sage-sync-build`, i.e., set `build_dir` to `None` in `setup.py`.

([Even] with that, upgrading from beta4+ will still trigger the rebuild of the whole Sage library, but only once.)

I was (more or less reluctantly) going to give this positive review, but then Travis discovered that using `build_dir` can also break `sage-clone`.

So I'm happy provided we make this ticket depend on the above patch / its ticket.
