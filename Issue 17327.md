I would simply keep the hash function from bitsets, at least it's fast and easy to understand.

Sorry to say, but your hash is actually much worse: the limb sequence (0,0,0,0,1) has the same hash as (0,0,0,0,0)

Ouch...

OK, I'll return to the bitset hash. And also I should document the new functions.
