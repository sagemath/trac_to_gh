Hello,

A few comments on this ticket:

1) Merge with latest beta of Sage is not possible as is, as some conflicts arise with the merge. It needs to be fixed.

2) There are some trailing whitespaces in both `matrix2.pyx` and `matrix_misc.py`, it will be good to remove them.

3) The documentation of `row_reduced_form` mentions weak Popov form several times, like:


```

 OUTPUT:

        `W` - a matrix over `k(x)` giving a weak the Popov form of self
```


but as far as I understand it, `row_reduced_form` does not compute the weak Popov form, for instance:


```
sage: R.<t> = QQ['t']
sage: M = matrix([[t,t,t^2],[0,0,t], [0, t, 0]])
sage: M.row_reduced_form()
[t t 0]
[0 0 t]
[0 t 0]
```
 
does not output a matrix in wPf as leading positions are the same for the first and third third rows of `M`. In that case, change occurences of weak Popov form by row reduced form.

4) It could be nice to add another example in `matrix_misc.py` to illustrate the output in the case where `transformation=True`.

5) You changed the arguments of `row_reduced_form` in this ticket. But in #16742, you will get the original implementation of `row_reduced_form`, which might create a conflict between the two tickets. You need to add a dependency somewhere to be sure that the merge goes smoothly.

I rewrote the patch because it didn't really fix the calling convention, while it still broke backwards compatibility without proper deprecation warnings. Now, the patch does as the new description says.

It's again at needs review.

I guess I'm bad news' harbinger again, as I noticed the following:


```
sage: PR.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: M = random_matrix(PR, 5, 5)
sage: type(M)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_zmod_flint.Polynomial_zmod_flint'>
sage: type(M.row_reduced_form(transformation=False, old_call=False)[0, 0])
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_FpT.FpTElement'>
```


So it seems that the actual implementation messes with the type of the elements in the matrix, which is never a good thing...
