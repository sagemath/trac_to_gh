It was suggested to change the `FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule._semigroup_representation` attribute to be an alias of `FiniteDimensionalInvariantModule._ambient`. I chose not to use this suggestion because the semigroup representation is required to build the basis which we use to call the `SubmoduleWithBasis.__init__` via `super()`, but the `._ambient` attribute is defined in `SubmoduleWithBasiis.__init__`, so it seemed circular.

Thank you. I have made my reviewer pass through the code. Overall it looks great. However, I thought some more about what type of constructions we want it to handle. As a result, I made what the invariant module can handle much more general. This allows us to use a natural action, should it exist, or pass a general action (not necessarily one defined on the basis).

In order to make things work smoothly, I had to extend some stuff for `Representation` so it more naturally works with subgroups and coercion. I also removed the `_l/rmul_` as those are generically implemented in the `IndexedModuleElement` class (I forgot about this; sorry!). I did some other documentation tweaks.

If my changes are good with you, then you can set a positive review.

The changes made before commit 2a64c19 look good to me. If the changes to the documentation I made are good, then you can set a positive review.
