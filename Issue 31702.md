Thank you. I have made my reviewer pass through the code. Overall it looks great. However, I thought some more about what type of constructions we want it to handle. As a result, I made what the invariant module can handle much more general. This allows us to use a natural action, should it exist, or pass a general action (not necessarily one defined on the basis).

In order to make things work smoothly, I had to extend some stuff for `Representation` so it more naturally works with subgroups and coercion. I also removed the `_l/rmul_` as those are generically implemented in the `IndexedModuleElement` class (I forgot about this; sorry!). I did some other documentation tweaks.

If my changes are good with you, then you can set a positive review.
