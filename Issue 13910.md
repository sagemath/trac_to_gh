At #9235, Niles Johnson suggested to deprecate get_action_c and coerce_map_from_c in sage/categories/homset.py

While I think it would be a good idea, it seems too much of a change for a reviewer patch, and thus I am opening this new ticket.

I guess moving to the new coercion model is an "enhancement", not the fix of a "defect".
