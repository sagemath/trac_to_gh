These are good, I think, in general.   Before a thorough look, can you also put some indirect tests in?  Usually in Sage documentation `__getitem__` and friends are tested via slicing, I think.   In any case, this would help anyone who comes upon this and is wondering what those things do.  The format is then 

```
sage: test[i] # indirect doctest
```

or something like this.  We do this for a number of underscore tests, though I don't think this is in the developer guide or anything.

Looks like this ticket is invalid now (v. my Sage 5.7.beta3 coverage test): 


```
knsam`@`PerverseSheaf:~/Downloads/sage-5.7.beta4/devel/sage/sage/gsl$ ../../../../sage --coverage interpolation.pyx 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCORE interpolation.pyx: 100.0% (11 of 11)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
}}} 

I'll put this up for review, in case, there are some parts of this patch, we could use positively.

In fact, this was indeed done in #12036.  And I even reviewed it, having forgotten about this one in the ensuing half-year plus...
