CC:  cremona jdemeyer

It would be useful to have a method `NumberFieldElement.logabs(emb)`, where `emb` is a real or complex embedding, such that `x.logabs(emb)` returns log |emb(x)|, increasing the precision of emb as needed, and raises an error if x = 0.

I don't see the point of adding a method to compute `log |emb(x)|` in a special way. Why not just fix `emb(x)` itself?

I don't completely agree with re-purposing this ticket.  In my opinion a method `logabs()` would still be useful.  It should implement *x* â†¦ log |*x*|<sub>v</sub> for any place *v*: either an Archimedean place defined by a real or complex embedding, or a non-Archimedean place defined by a prime ideal of the ring of integers.  For Archimedean places it would do this by simply computing the embedding to sufficient precision and then taking the logarithm of the absolute value.  For non-Archimedean places it should return `-x.valuation(p) * RR(p.norm()).log()`, which would presumably be more efficient than `RR(p.norm()^-x.valuation(p)).log()`.

Anyway, I'm not going to do that now, so I don't mind too much if this becomes the ticket for fixing the accuracy of real/complex embeddings.  Still, I would be in favour of having a `logabs()` method at some point (on a different ticket).

OK, fine. However, since I thought the motivation for this was to fix #19276, I decided to re-purpose this ticket with a different fix for #19276.
