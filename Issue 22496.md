In a fresh Sage:

```
sage: var('a b c c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 d i j m n p r k u x y z')
(a, b, c, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, d, i, j, m, n, p, r, k, u, x, y, z)
sage: a.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: b.series(x)
(b)

sage: var('z0 z')
(z0, z)
sage: z0.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: z.series(x)
(z)

sage: var('z0 z')
(z0, z)
sage: z.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: z0.series(x)
(z0)
```

It seems to always affect the first call to series.

Note: The failure is dependent on memory content and changes with every change of the comment part of the code. So, while this is fixed and the test always passes the test might not fail in versions that have the bug reintroduced.

It's hard to have tests that are guaranteed to fail if a bug was (re)introduced, so we will just have to do the best we can.
