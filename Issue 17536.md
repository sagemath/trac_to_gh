# Issue 17536: Disable PARI_stack_limit

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17773

In a multi-threaded program, PARI's mechanism to check for overflow can lead to false positives. Calling `pari_stackcheck_init(NULL)` will disable this check.

I tried this out and it solved the problem I had been having (which was running the lmfdb website code in --debug mode causing a spurious PariError when pari.get_debug_level() was called).
