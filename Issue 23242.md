Why the squaring in the non-real place case?

```
        except AttributeError:
            if is_real_place(v):
                return R(v(iota).abs())
            else:
--->            return R(v(iota).abs()**2)
```

Follow-up at #28241 which proposes to remove that squaring.

This is the normalized absolute value, as in section 13.3 in https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.785/2017fa/LectureNotes13.pdf

Maybe it's not named well or put in the right place?
