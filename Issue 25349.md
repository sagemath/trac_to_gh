Similar to #25591: the hash of a fraction field should be different from the hash of its underlying ring.

What you did for congruence subgroups is not a very good idea as it will break equality

```
sage: G = Gamma(2)
sage: H = G.as_permutation_group()
sage: G == H
True
```

One (expensive) possibility for now would be

```
def __hash__(self):
    return hash(self.as_permutation_group())
```

All this tests is that, at best, it doesn't crash (which is almost completely trivial).  It should instead demonstrate at least a case where two hashes compare the same as expected, and where two hashes differ, as expected.

I agree it's annoying to write these tests which is why I've been pokey about making tickets for `__hash__` implementations in the first place :)

Why not just `hash(self._R)`?  Is it possible for instances of these fields to have a parent ring that's equivalent to itself, or something (in which case we'd need this in order for them to have unique hashes)?  And where does the magic number come from?

I see, he wrote:

But why is that?  It doesn't matter if they have the same hash unless they can also compare equal to each other.

In any case, even if there is a good reason, this should probably be noted.  It's not obvious.

> PING ? This is a major hurting point..

Please try to show some patience.  I have tickets that I believe are important that haven't been merged or even reviewed in months (a situation I'm not happy with, but there is only so much attention to go around).

If you've already fixed the issue then there's nothing holding you back--this is why I have my private Python 3 branch--everything I fix gets merged into it immediately and then I can carry on (even if that fix is not ultimately the accepted fix; at least it works in the meantime).

The rest of us have vacations, family, sickness, and other tasks to work on and adding "ping" to a ticket does not (at least in my case) make it any more likely that I'll see it sooner.
