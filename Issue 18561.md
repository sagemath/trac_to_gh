Nazarov's 1996 paper titled "Young's Orthogonal Form for Brauer's Centralizer Algebra," outlines a form for the Jucys-Murphy elements that are analogous to the JM elements for the symmetric group algebra. Implementing these into Sage would require a few lines of code but would prove very useful for work done with the Brauer algebra.

Sorry, this git history is hard to read! The only change this ticket should include over 18762 is the `jucys_murphy` method within the `BrauerAlgebra` class.

Do you think we should also make this a cached method? What about when `j > n`, what happens then (or is it even defined)?
