# Issue 18561: Jucys-Murphy Elements for Brauer Algebra

Nazarov's 1996 paper titled "Young's Orthogonal Form for Brauer's Centralizer Algebra," outlines a form for the Jucys-Murphy elements that are analogous to the JM elements for the symmetric group algebra. Implementing these into Sage would require a few lines of code but would prove very useful for work done with the Brauer algebra.

Sorry, this git history is hard to read! The only change this ticket should include over 18762 is the `jucys_murphy` method within the `BrauerAlgebra` class.

Is this ready for review? A few things from a quick lookover: Make the reference key `[N]` longer to avoid potential conflicts and docstrings should be declarative (so it will start with `Return`).

Yeah, this is ready for review. Thank you for the suggestions thus far!

A couple of suggestions:

```diff
     def jucys_murphy(self, j):
         r"""
-        Return a generalized Jucys-Murphy elements for the Brauer algebra.
-        These are outlined in [Naz]_.
+        Return the ``j``-th generalized Jucys-Murphy element of ``self``.
 
+        Could you give a more detailed description of how the elements are defined?

         EXAMPLES:

             sage: B = BrauerAlgebra(3,z)
             sage: B.jucys_murphy(1)
             1/2*z - 1/2
             sage: B.jucys_murphy(3)
-            -B{{-3, -2}, {-1, 1}, {2, 3}} - B{{-3, -1}, {-2, 2}, {1, 3}} + B{{-3, 1}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 3}} + B{{-3, 2}, {-2, 3}, {-1, 1}} + (1/2*z-1/2)*B{{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
+            -B{{-3, -2}, {-1, 1}, {2, 3}} - B{{-3, -1}, {-2, 2}, {1, 3}}
+            + B{{-3, 1}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 3}} + B{{-3, 2}, {-2, 3}, {-1, 1}}
+            + (1/2*z-1/2)*B{{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}
         """
-        B = self
-        return (B._q-1)/2 + sum(B([[i,-j],[j,-i]]) - B([[i,j],[-i,-j]]) for i in range(1,j))
+        I = self._indices
+        one = self.base_ring().one()
+        return ((self._q-1)/2
+                + self._from_dict({I([[i,-j],[j,-i]]): one for i in range(1,j)}, remove_zeros=False)
+                - self._from_dict({I([[i,j],[-i,-j]]): one for i in range(1,j)}, remove_zeros=False))
```

Do you think we should also make this a cached method? What about when `j > n`, what happens then (or is it even defined)?

Alright, I added a small explanation to the docstring, and also took into account the one element of base ring. However, the problem with your `_from_dict` rewrite is that it does not pass the doctests. This is because when you call the element constructor, it "fills in" information you don't give it, but the `BrauerDiagram` class does not do this. Is there a reason to prefer using the `_from_dict` approach? Finally, I believe it probably could be a cached method, although it also isn't a terribly intense computation.

I made some minor tweaks to the documentation. The reason why I use the `_from_dict` to avoid the coercion framework, and it has a two-fold advantage of being faster and not invoking the coercion framework (which has in the past led to annoying consequences). My changes also fix a bug that the first Jucys-Murphy element was not in the Brauer algebra. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set a positive review.

Alright. I am satisfied with these changes. Good catch on the first element!
