In the current manifold implementation, scalar fields (in the above meaning) play a crucial role, since their algebra is the base ring for the modules of vector fields and tensor fields. In particular, for parallelizable real manifolds, the dimensionality of these modules depends crucially on the codomain of scalar fields being **R** and not **C**.

A complexification of the tangent and cotangent space would be very useful. Namely, if you consider a complex manifold `M` of dimension n to be a real manifold of dimension 2n. Then, one obtains natural coordinates given by complexification, `z_k = x_k + i*y_k` and `\bar{z}_k = x_k - i*y_k`, which are very useful for complex vector bundles and complex differential forms.

Since the whole framework bases on symbolic expressions, there is no barrier of introducing the aforementioned coordinates as chart coordinates (I've made an example for characteristic classes where I did this. Perhaps you should take a detailed look an that after I'll have uploaded it). But somehow, this feels like an abuse.
