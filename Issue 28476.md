Well, I guess this depends on what is meant by _scalar field_. In the current context, a scalar field is a function taking values in the base field of the manifold. So, if _M_ is a manifold over *R*, a function _M -->_ *C* is not a scalar field. In the current manifold implementation, scalar fields (in the above meaning) play a crucial role, since their algebra is the base ring for the modules of vector fields and tensor fields. In particular, for parallelizable real manifolds, the dimensionality of these modules depends crucially on the codomain of scalar fields being *R* and not *C*. For these reasons, I would lean towards introducing a new structure for complex-valued functions, leaving the current implementation of scalar fields untouched.

PS: speaking about complexification, there were some thoughts expressed in #18786 (unfortunately not developed further).

A complexification of the tangent and cotangent space would be very useful. Namely, if you consider a complex manifold `M` of dimension n to be a real manifold of dimension 2n. Then, one obtains natural coordinates given by complexification, `z_k = x_k + i*y_k` and `\bar{z}_k = x_k - i*y_k`, which are very useful for complex vector bundles and complex differential forms.

Since the whole framework bases on symbolic expressions, there is no barrier of introducing the aforementioned coordinates as chart coordinates (I've made an example for characteristic classes where I did this. Perhaps you should take a detailed look an that after I'll have uploaded it). But somehow, this feels like an abuse.

Yes there is no barrier at the moment and actually we already played this game in the past, see cell [36] of [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v1.3/SM_Simon-Mars_Kerr.ipynb), which introduces a self-dual complex 2-form.

My idea so far: Checking the symbolic expressions of scalar fields via the method `is_real` and from that deduce the destination domain.

Yes, sounds reasonable at this stage.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
