# Issue 20308: Use formatargspec of Sphinx

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Sphinx's `autodoc` extension now has a custom `formatargspec` function. We should use that instead of `sage_formatargspec` (and delete the latter).

There should have been a deprecation warning before completely removing the two functions from `sage.misc.sageinspect`, which is orthogonal to using different ones in the Sphinx extension.

I.e., there was no need to remove them just because the _Sphinx extension_ does no longer need them.  After all, IMHO `src/sage_setup/` and especially `src/sage_setup/docbuild/` don't really belong to the Sage library, in contrast to `sage.misc.*`, which certainly does.

Only public stuff needs deprecation

Replying to [comment:14 vbraun]:
> Only public stuff needs deprecation

These were not underscore-prefixed functions, hence "public".

Thats not how we mark implementation details as private
