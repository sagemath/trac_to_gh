Another class of chemical graphs that are widely studied in chemical graph theory are fusenes and benzenoids. The benzene generator by Gunnar Brinkmann and Gilles Caporossi generates these at a ridiculously fast pace. This ticket adds a package benzene containing the program (the version released with Grinvin, since that version is GPL 3) and also adds some code to call the generator.

Hellooooooooooooooooo !!!

Wow ! Very nice patch, very clean, nothing to say about that. Thouuuuuuuuuughh could you make your doctest a bit faster to check ?

By the way it is nice that the code is GPL, maybe this package will eventually make it to Sage's standards spkg `:-)`

Added a new version of the patch. I accidently forgot to overwrite the previous one, so only the second patch is needed.

Changes the doctest is no problem. I more or less randomly choose the value, but indeed, it is quite high.
