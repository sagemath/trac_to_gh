The "fix" is to use gcc 7.2, which compiles fplll just fine.

(by the way, /datapool/dima/Sage/sagetrac-mirror - the SAGEROOT of my build - is world-readable, you may look there for logs and patches...)

Strange. And GCC 7.2.0 did *not* fix the analogous problems with `pow()` for Singular?

No, it did not. 
But Singular's error with pow() is different (the only one that matters with gcc 7.2, anyway), there it's inability to use the templated pow() (failure to instantiate the template for `int pow(int,int)`)

And indeed Singular with gcc 7.2 does not need patches for floor() and sqrt(), only the pow() ones are needed.

OK, so this is indeed gcc-5-specific, as I gather from your pull request (and from experimental evidence with gcc 7.2).

I haven't tested a complete build of fplll myself (it takes a really long time to build by the way). So it might break for a stupid reason.
