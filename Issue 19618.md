There is `moebius_algebra()` in finite lattices, and `mobius_function()` in finite posets. Another should be changed. Same applies to `mobius_transform` on `hyperbolic_isometry.py` and `moebius` on `libs/pari/auto_gen.pxi` etc.

Before changes wait to see if discussion at sage-devel comes to end. Then change also this description.

Where did those `conf.py` came?

Otherwise this can be commented. I have not yet run tests, so not in needs_review anyways.

There is `src/sage/rings/arith.py` with


```
    def __repr__(self):
        """
        Returns a description of this function.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: q = Moebius()
            sage: q.__repr__()
            'The Möbius function'
        """
        return "The Möbius function"

and it says


```
Expected:
    The Möbius function
Got:
    'The M\xc3\xb6bius function'
```


I can see no difference to other functions. Charcode-line at the beginning of file is same etc. Any ideas?

OK, now this should be OK. There was an error at `src/sage/algebras/catalog.py`, so I did *not* change class name but corrected a broken link.

I changed every docstring so that right form, "Möbius", is used everywhere except in the code. Also `_repr_` is changed.

Good catch. It seems that there is no difference between the two, but "coding" is used many times more than "encoding". Should I unify them on another patch, just to make automatic processing a little bit easier?

This is what I get:

```
sage: s = "ü"
sage: s
'\xc3\xbc'
```

Granted, this is fixed by doing `print s`, and we have the same behavior for `s = u"ü"`. Yet most output does not occur with a print statement.
