PARI 2.7.2 was released last week.  If you want to finish this straightforward upgrade, I will be happy to review it; I don't currently want to spend a lot of time on the alternative #16997, especially because of the new patches on that ticket and the related upstream issues.

I see no reason to finish this ticket: it doesn't solve any problem we're currently having and I prefer to put efforts towards #16997 instead.

I agree that is a very annoying situation. However, ignoring that problem isn't going to make it go away. Perhaps a discussion on `sage-devel` is in order about the "PARI situation".

Since the alternative is merged, should we close this ticket ?
