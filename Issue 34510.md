I tried on macOS silicon (M1) 12.6.1 and get multiple dockets errors, all 

```
sage -t --warn-long 33.5 --random-seed=322045618648464306013656253226348851101 src/sage/graphs/bliss.pyx

I see file `/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/libbliss.a` but not `libbliss.2.dylib`.

Thanks for testing! Indeed the shared library seems to be missing; I'll investigate
