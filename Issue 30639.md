# Issue 30639: sage_build_cython: Do not rely on CC environment variable being set

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30876

CC:  dimpase mjo fbissey

(from #30580):

`src/sage_setup/command/sage_build_cython.py` contains this code:

```
# Work around GCC-4.8 bug which miscompiles some sig_on() statements:
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14460
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/20226
# * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982
if subprocess.call("""$CC --version | grep -i 'gcc.* 4[.]8' >/dev/null """, shell=True) == 0:
    extra_compile_args.append('-fno-tree-copyrename')
```

This gives an (ignored) error when `CC` is not set -- which can happen if invoked outside of `sage-env`, for example when building an sdist.


```
$ python3 -u setup.py --no-user-cfg sdist >/tmp/res
/bin/sh: 1: --version: not found
```

What does happen if CC is not set, how is setup.py getting the compilers to use? Via distutils?
Can't CC be set in setup.py if needed?

Yes, distutils. So distutils should also be used to construct the command line for this version test.

it looks doable, but ugly as hell:

```python
from distutils.ccompiler import new_compiler, get_default_compiler
new_compiler(get_default_compiler()).compile(["foo.c"])
```

and then 

```bash
$ strings hello.o | grep GCC
GCC: (Gentoo 8.3.1-r2 p4) 8.3.1 20190518
```

allows version extraction.

Wouldn't it be easier to, e.g., parse the banner of Python?

```
$ python
Python 3.7.9 (default, Sep 15 2020, 15:01:07) 
[GCC 8.3.1 20190518] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

I think the call to `gcc --version` can be implemented in a simple and clean way in `sage_build_ext`, which has access to `self.compiler.compiler`


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-11-12 11:19:41

If I do 

```python
>>> cc=new_compiler(get_default_compiler())
>>> _=cc.compile(["foo.c"], extra_preargs=['-dumpversion'])
8.3.1
```

then I see the version value. So one can wrap this in a script.
(one can also use `--version` instead of `-dumpversion` for a longer output.)

I've also asked on stackoverflow, nobody knows...

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

We already reject gcc-4.7 and older in `spkg-configure.m4`. Would anyone notice if we rejected 4.8 (May, 2014) as well?

And if we do want to continue supporting gcc-4.8 from the system, couldn't we append `-fno-tree-copyrename` to `CFLAGS` to fix this? The optimization is buggy in 4.8.x so I don't think it's unjustified.

Replying to [comment:9 mjo]:
> Would anyone notice if we rejected 4.8 (May, 2014) as well?

Yes, this is the compiler on `ubuntu-trusty` and `centos-7`, which are still widely used.

We are dropping support for a platform with gcc 4.9 (`debian-jessie`) in Sage 9.5 (for #25009) because it turns to be more broken than 4.8.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-12-04 00:55:00

A trivial fix is to just replace `$CC` by `${CC-gcc}`


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2021-12-04 01:35:41

nobody nowadays is using gcc 4 on Centos 7. There are system packages to get you gcc 9. cf. e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/67212990/557937

Same story with Ubuntu, more or less.
https://askubuntu.com/a/1149383/309919

We can and should drop gcc 4, without dropping OSs.

We can and should add variants of fedora/centos with `devtoolset` to our tox/GH Actions. So far this is neither tested nor documented anywhere.

I've opened #32965/#32966 for this.

probably even more relevant than these semi-vanilla cases would be the Azure docker container used in cibuildwheel to build manylinux wheels.

Is the branch really in the state you want? The last commit basically remove the content of the previous one. Otherwise I am all for removing useless bits.

Branch pushed to git repo; I updated commit sha1. This was a forced push. New commits:

Thanks. I've squashed/rebased it. Yes, all of it can go away

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

We should really get that in quick. It has been waiting long enough.
