CC:  @dimpase @orlitzky @kiwifb

(from #30580):

`src/sage_setup/command/sage_build_cython.py` contains this code:

```
# Work around GCC-4.8 bug which miscompiles some sig_on() statements:
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14460
# * http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/20226
# * http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56982
if subprocess.call("""$CC --version | grep -i 'gcc.* 4[.]8' >/dev/null """, shell=True) == 0:
    extra_compile_args.append('-fno-tree-copyrename')
```

This gives an (ignored) error when `CC` is not set -- which can happen if invoked outside of `sage-env`, for example when building an sdist.


```
$ python3 -u setup.py --no-user-cfg sdist >/tmp/res
/bin/sh: 1: --version: not found
```

it looks doable, but ugly as hell:

```python
from distutils.ccompiler import new_compiler, get_default_compiler
new_compiler(get_default_compiler()).compile(["foo.c"])
```

and then 

```bash
$ strings hello.o | grep GCC
GCC: (Gentoo 8.3.1-r2 p4) 8.3.1 20190518
```

allows version extraction.

Wouldn't it be easier to, e.g., parse the banner of Python?

We already reject gcc-4.7 and older in `spkg-configure.m4`. Would anyone notice if we rejected 4.8 (May, 2014) as well?

And if we do want to continue supporting gcc-4.8 from the system, couldn't we append `-fno-tree-copyrename` to `CFLAGS` to fix this? The optimization is buggy in 4.8.x so I don't think it's unjustified.

Replying to [comment:9 mjo]:
> Would anyone notice if we rejected 4.8 (May, 2014) as well?

Yes, this is the compiler on `ubuntu-trusty` and `centos-7`, which are still widely used.

We are dropping support for a platform with gcc 4.9 (`debian-jessie`) in Sage 9.5 (for #25009) because it turns to be more broken than 4.8.
