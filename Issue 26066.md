The `k_shape.py` portion of the migration of the **k_combinat_for_sage** (https://github.com/MareoRaft/k_combinat_for_sage) project into core sage (see also the mother ticket #25295).

It seems appropriate for the `is_k_shape` method to belong to the `Partition` object, and to then create a `kShape` class which subclasses `Partition` and included the relevant methods.  So that's what I'm proposing, but open to ideas.

Alternatively, `is_k_shape` can remain as a utility method within `k_shape.py` itself.  Useful for telling whether a list, Composition, or a Partition is a k-shape.
