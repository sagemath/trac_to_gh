Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

CC:  @rlmill @nathanncohen @dcoudert

Keywords: directed graph, product

The Cartesian product of directed graphs does not work. For example


```
sage: P=DiGraph([[0,1]])          
sage: Q=P.cartesian_product(P)
sage: len(Q.edges())         
0
```


The result is a disconnected union of 4 points.
This should be a commutative square, with 4 edges.

* It would be better if the examples given check something else than the fact that the number of vertices is correct. One can for example count the edges.

* Maybe remove the plot in the examples, which has not much to do there.

* Maybe check the commutativity of the product

It was original examples. I removed them. They are not so useful.
 
> * Maybe check the commutativity of the product

Already done with is_isomorphic tests.

> * Maybe it would be good to have a test with loops ?

I added a test with loops: small De Bruijn product an arc. The resulting digraph contains 2 copies of the debruijn and arcs from vertices in one copy to corresponding vertex in other copy.

Should be better now.

Since the tests are displayed both in the documentation and in the `g.cartesian_product?` page, I don't see the need for a specific example section that will have similar stuff than the tests section.

> * I would like the following sentence raise TypeError ('Both arguments must be of the same class.')  to be more precise : 'The graphs should be both directed or both undirected.' 

Done in new version.

*According to Nicolas Thiery :*

Once the graph G is created, the whole end of this method would be
best rewritten as something like:

        G.add_vertices( (u,v) for u in self.vertex_iterator() for v in        other.vertex_iterator() )
        G.add_edges( ((u,v), (u1,v)) for (u,u1) in self .edge_iterator() for v in other.vertex_iterator() )
        G.add_edges( ((u,v), (u,v1)) for (v,v1) in other.edge_iterator() for u in self .vertex_iterator() )


I do not know if this is better, in any way, than what you wrote. Maybe faster ? 

If you do not want to spend more time on this ticket, I can give a positive review for the current patch.

Unfortunately your proposal is slower than the implementation of this patch.

With this patch:

```
sage: g = graphs.GridGraph([10,10]); g
Grid Graph for []: Graph on 100 vertices
sage: h = graphs.CubeGraph(8); h
8-Cube: Graph on 256 vertices
sage: %timeit gg = g.cartesian_product(h)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.31 s per loop
sage: %timeit gg = h.cartesian_product(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.31 s per loop
```


With your proposal on the same graphs:

```
sage: %timeit gg = g.cartesian_product(h)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.9 s per loop
sage: %timeit gg = h.cartesian_product(g)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.9 s per loop
```


So I propose to stay with current implementation.

Interesting that calling repeatedly add_edge is faster than add_edges!

I am fine with the current implementation, though maybe using edge_iterator would be faster, since the former does a sort (which I don't like but that's another story). I let you see if you want to do that.

The point is that using add_edges, we first create a new list of edges, and then iterate this list to add edges to the new graph. So somehow we do the job twice. My tests suggest that current implementation is a bit faster.

I have changed the patch to use the edge_iterator. It is now slightly faster (few ms less on large graphs).

A good reason :-)
