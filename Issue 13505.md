About half the changesets are unnecessary whitespace changes... Do you see any point besides breaking other people's patches?

Anyways, good enough.

Well.. I have been told to never remove all trailing whitespaces from a patch at once because it broke patch, and to remove them slowly instead, patch by patch. So I remove some when I go over them.

I would prefer to remove them all at once, of course.

Hello,

just one minor comment about this patch: you use both Shaefli and Schäfli (and I don't know which is the correct one). Are you sure anyone is able to see the second one? No encoding issue?
For instance, when I look at the source code of the patch in my browser, the "Schäfli" are replaced with some stupid "SchlÃ€fli"... When I do graphs.SchaefliGraph?? the output is with "ä" in my terminal. Shouldn't you use only "ae"?

Best.

The source file `graph_generators.py` specifies UTF-8 and the patch is correctly encoded. The trac preview of the patch screws up the encoding. In German, ae is the correct substitute for ä if you are unable to use the umlaut. So it is correct that the Python identifier is Schaefli and the docstring is Schäfli.
