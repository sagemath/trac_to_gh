Dependency must start with a hash-character for the patchbot to pick it up

About half the changesets are unnecessary whitespace changes... Do you see any point besides breaking other people's patches?

Anyways, good enough.

Well.. I have been told to never remove all trailing whitespaces from a patch at once because it broke patch, and to remove them slowly instead, patch by patch. So I remove some when I go over them.

I would prefer to remove them all at once, of course.

Just don't do it at all! If you even care about trailing whitespace at all (why?) then focus your effort on not introducing extra. Its an OCD ritual that you have to stop ;-)

Well. I did not even know they existed, and then the combinat guys said that it was evil `:-P`

Hello,

just one minor comment about this patch: you use both Shaefli and Schäfli (and I don't know which is the correct one). Are you sure anyone is able to see the second one? No encoding issue?
For instance, when I look at the source code of the patch in my browser, the "Schäfli" are replaced with some stupid "SchlÃ€fli"... When I do graphs.SchaefliGraph?? the output is with "ä" in my terminal. Shouldn't you use only "ae"?

Best.

Hmmmm.. Well, it does not seem to be the correct name, so I tried to use "ae" as rarely as possible.. I guess it will not confuse anybody,and this way it appears in google whatever we type in the search bar `:-)`

The source file `graph_generators.py` specifies UTF-8 and the patch is correctly encoded. The trac preview of the patch screws up the encoding. In German, ae is the correct substitute for ä if you are unable to use the umlaut. So it is correct that the Python identifier is Schaefli and the docstring is Schäfli.

OK. It was just to be sure.

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.7.beta2.

I rebased it on beta1 as beta2 does not work on my machine, but I guess that it'll still pass `:-)`
