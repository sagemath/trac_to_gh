there are 102 `REFERENCE(S):` tags in graphs/, so this is not too much work (which us a part of #27497)

One should also add DOI to all these, e.g. there is doi2bib on pypi, which can be used to generate all that stuff...

The reference to CIA is now orphaned.


```
*Quelques proprietes topologiques des
+             graphes et applications a internet et aux reseaux*
```

is missing the accents, and should be

```
*Quelques propriétés topologiques des
+             graphes et applications à internet et aux réseaux*
```


Otherwise, good to go. You can set to positive when fixed.
