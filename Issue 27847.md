# Issue 27847: move references from graphs/ to references/index.rst

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28084

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2019-06-30 10:51:49

there are 102 `REFERENCE(S):` tags in graphs/, so this is not too much work (which us a part of #27497)

One should also add DOI to all these, e.g. there is doi2bib on pypi, which can be used to generate all that stuff...

I would suggest to stop here, and make that in small chunks. This would have better chances to make it into sage with too much rebasing hassle.

Ok. What do you think is a good number of references to move per ticket? 20?

I think it's OK to do as many as possible, and then once do a rebase, which should be easy, as these changes are well-localised, rather than have a huge number of tickets doing essentially the same change.

It still merges now,so you can e.g. put it up for review, and do the rest of graphs/ in another.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

The reference to CIA is now orphaned.


```
*Quelques proprietes topologiques des
+             graphes et applications a internet et aux reseaux*
```

is missing the accents, and should be

```
*Quelques propriétés topologiques des
+             graphes et applications à internet et aux réseaux*
```


Otherwise, good to go. You can set to positive when fixed.
