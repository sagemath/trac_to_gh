# Issue 17719: Stopgap for Partitions/Compositions

Since `Partitions` and `Compositions` are just wrappers around `IntegerListsLex`, they inherit all the known bugs of that function, see #17548. Therefore, those functions should also use `IntegerListsLexPublic` with the stopgap from #17898.

This is madness. The very function which returns wrong results has no stopgap, and now we find ourselves adding stopgaps to all functions that call it.

What's the alternative, reverting #17898? I wouldn't mind...

Perhaps we should do that. I mean: get rid of `IntegerListsLexPublic`, and have a flag in `IntegerListsLex` saying "I don't want to see the warning". At least we list not have to manually change the imports. Someone proposed that in the mailing lists at some point.

We would buy peace by just making the crystal code call these things without warning.

Since there is a SageDays on algebraic combinatorics next week, maybe some of the experts in the field can form a plan. I tentatively added it as a project to http://wiki.sagemath.org/days64, though I won't be there.

Should we close this ticket ? Really, adding warnings to the functions that call `IntegerListsLex` is a bad way out... We need to solve the actual problem.

I guess we can close this as fixed...
