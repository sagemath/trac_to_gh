# Issue 26660: minor doc fixes in misc.c3_controlled

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26897

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2018-12-14 19:52:25

This adds some cross references and fixes a few rendering problems in the documentation for `misc/c3_controlled.pyx`. For example: ```HierarchyElement``s` will not be rendered properly because Sphinx won't recognize the last ```` as ending the string.
