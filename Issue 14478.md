I can do it in a few days, I'm traveling (to Berlin) starting today. So I'll do it once I settle in if Dima (or someone else) doesn't review this beforehand.

We're travelling to Paris, leaving tomorrow. :–) I'll look into this on the plane (12 hours flight...)...

Everything looks okay to me, but I haven't tested all of Sage yet.

All tests passed for me. Dima, any comments?

`SPKG.txt` refers to the wrong version:

```
## Changelog

### gap-4.6.3.p0 (Volker Braun, 3 June 2013)
 * #14682: Upgrade to version 4.6.4
```

Rebased libGAP spkg.

Only some SPKG.txt entries were missing, I guess. The correct log is always the mercurial commit log.
