I didn't mean a substantive one, but possibly a trivial one (still needing rebasing), since it touches one of the same files (trig.py) near the place where that ticket changes things.  I haven't actually checked this, probably it's not a problem.

Or, looking at it, I guess #10034 needs to have more files fixed.  See my comment there.
