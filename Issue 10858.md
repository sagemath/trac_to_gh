In the last month four people reported getting "RuntimeError: Unable to create L-series, due to precision or other limits in PARI." when trying to input their own interesting L-series to the Dokchitser wrapper in Sage.   The problem is in lfunctions/dokchitser.py; it's just a dumb little mistake.  The attached patch fixes it.  For review this will also need some doctests (the bug is here since the functionality was never tested!).

Ouch, I'd been bitten by that too. No idea the bug was so stupid, nice catch.

There is a warning building the documentation:

```
