# Issue 23923: Improve speed of dominated_partitions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24160

Use the iterator that returns lists and check the dominance condition on that to avoid the (relatively) costly creation of a `Partition`.

This gives ~35% speedup:

```
sage: P = Partition([7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
sage: %timeit P.dominated_partitions()
10 loops, best of 3: 26.5 ms per loop
```

versus old

```
sage: P = Partition([7,6,5,4,3,2,1])
sage: %timeit P.dominated_partitions()
10 loops, best of 3: 37.3 ms per loop
```

Unless we can implement box-sliding in a fast way, we will not beat the naÃ¯ve way for a reasonable partition size.

LGTM!

PS. In the implementation of `dominates`, you can replace

```
        min_length = min(len(p1), len(p2))
        if min_length == 0:
            return len(p1) >= len(p2)
```

by

```
        min_length = min(len(p1), len(p2))
        if min_length == 0:
            return len(p2) == 0
```

Not sure if it's worth it :)

Actually, perhaps more relevant: Why does it `            return len(p1) >= len(p2)` in one case and `        return bool(sum(p1) >= sum(p2))` in the other?

It is a nice micro-optimization at least. As for comment:5, Jason Bandlow was the last one to touch that line in Oct. 2008. I've removed it.

It's a positive review then!

Changing keywords from "" to "partitions".
