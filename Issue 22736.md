The `__ne__` in `interface.py` needs a doctest.

Actually, there is a mixin class `WithEqualityById` that might be better to use.

I added the doctest. Maybe one can keep the WithEqualityById class for another ticket (and for somebody else)

Here is the version using `WithEqualityById`, which is just using a mixin class for the same behavior. It almost seems like the interfaces should be a subclass of `Singleton`, but that is a more invasive change and for another ticket.
