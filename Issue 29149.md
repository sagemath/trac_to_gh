# Issue 29149: Install script packages via sage-spkg

Follow-up from #29287.

Script packages are installed by special rules in `build/make/Makefile`.

This ticket installs them by `sage-spkg` instead. This enables script packages to participate in the staged installs (`SAGE_DESTDIR`) and uninstallation mechanisms.

This is useful for #29082... to clean up #27870/#29003, which introduced files in `SAGE_LOCAL` that do not belong to any package and are never uninstalled.

Rebased and dropped all clean/uninstall changes here because that is #29097
