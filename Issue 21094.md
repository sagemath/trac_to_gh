The coding part of Sage (see #18846) contains Roth-Ruckenstein algorithm to compute the roots of a polynomial `Q(y)` with coefficients in `F[x]` (where `F` is a finite field). The purpose of this ticket is to move the implementation to make this algorithm a method of polynomials. 

Toward this end, we also define a generic implementation for roots of univariate polynomials over univariate polynomial rings, that goes through their factorization. And this requires to implement the factorization for these "recursive" polynomial rings: Currently, the algorithm consists in flattening the recursive polynomial ring and use methods for multivariate polynomial rings.

There remains one step to perform: Remove Roth-Ruckenstein from `coding` and branch the new implementation.

doc, does not build, see patchbot report:

+[dochtml] Warning: Could not import sage.coding.guruswami_sudan.rootfinding No module named rootfinding

and incomplete coverage:
+Decreased doctests in coding/guruswami_sudan/gs_decoder.py: from 17 / 17 = 100% to 17 / 18 = 94%

Argh, I did not check to documentation well enough! I'm working on it.

I checked the ticket by following the checklist and the algorithm by considering the paper of Roth-Ruckenstein. It seems OK.
