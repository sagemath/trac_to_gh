# Issue 18469: Improve Efficiency of Matroid initialization

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18706

Original creator: Rudi

Original creation time: 2015-06-15 18:31:11

Assignee: Rudi

Initialization of various classes of Matroid happen throughout the code. Even minor improvements to the efficiency of this basic routine (and the way it is called) may have a global effect on the efficiency of the matroid code.

Before:

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()
sage: timeit("M.is_graphic()")
5 loops, best of 3: 39.5 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: M = matroids.named_matroids.ExtendedBinaryGolayCode()
sage: timeit("M.is_graphic()")
625 loops, best of 3: 1.55 ms per loop
```

That seems to do it. The initializer calls from  _minor also need work, but that was dealt with in #18660 - working on that ticket gave me the idea to check out the other calls to the matroid initializers.

Needs review.

That's quite an impressive speedup.
