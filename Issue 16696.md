I'm pretty sure the stuff in `integer_list.py` is not deprecated yet as it's still needed.

I know I'm being pedantic here...

Explicitly calling `Partition._repr_(self, compact=False)` hasn't been deprecated so I guess the argument cannot be removed, it should just be totally ignored but not disallowed.

And `RootSystem(['A',2]).weight_lattice().pi` isn't deprecated either...

According to the comment it somehow is deprecated. But I can revert this change.

Do you want me to deprecate the argument?

What I meant is that the deprecation warning is commented out in the code for reasons which are not entirely clear to me. I think you should just uncomment that deprecation warning (with ticket number #16933).

Perhaps replace the argument with `def _repr(self, compact=None):` and then you can do in the code

```
if compact is not None:
```

Adding a deprecation warning to `pi()` leads to several failing doctests because of the ``@`lazy_attribute`. Removing ``@`lazy_attribute` also doesn't help.

Since there is a warning about the deprecation of `pi()` in documentation for more than 2 years now (see #6588), we should simply remove `pi()`.
