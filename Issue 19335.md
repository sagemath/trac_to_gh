Rename keyword `method` to `algorithm` like in #6094 years ago. Files to change:


```
src/sage/combinat/alternating_sign_matrix.py
src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/cluster_seed.py
src/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx
src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/hecke_triangle_groups.py
src/sage/modular/modform_hecketriangle/hecke_triangle_group_element.py
```


Files to check


```
src/sage/combinat/designs/covering_design.py
src/sage/combinat/words/word_generators.py -> construction_method?
src/sage/combinat/e_one_star.py
src/sage/misc/misc.py
```


Parts 1 and 2 are #19550 and #19559.

Why this as _only_ change in this file?

I don't know. Maybe my brain was overheated or something. Removed.
