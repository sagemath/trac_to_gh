sage: A.insert_row(A.nrows(),[6,7])
[1 2]                                                                                                                                                                                           
[3 4]                                                                                                                                                                                           
[6 7]  
sage: V = matrix(GF(3), [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
```

V does not have the function .insert_row(). Also, it would be nice to have insert_column().
