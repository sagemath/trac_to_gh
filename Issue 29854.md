We propose to add a method `dual` to modules `M` as an abbreviation for `Hom(M, M.base_ring())`.

For vector spaces, we create a specialized class so that it prints in a more concise way than this:

```
sage: Hom(QQ^2, QQ)
Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations) from Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field to Rational Field
```

and has more functionality to make linear algebra less awkward.

```
sage: _.an_element()
NotImplementedError: please implement _an_element_ for Set of Morphisms (Linear Transformations) from Vector space of dimension 2 over Rational Field to Rational Field
```


`FiniteRankFreeModule` already has this functionality. The new interface should be compatible with it.

```
sage: Q3 = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: Q3.dual()
Dual of the 3-dimensional vector space over the Rational Field
```
