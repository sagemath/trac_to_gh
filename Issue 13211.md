# Issue 13211: Fixed missing documentation of sage/rings/real_lazy missing in doc/en/reference/rings_numerical.rst

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13383

Original creator: nthiery

Original creation time: 2012-08-19 21:51:56

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: real lazy field documentation

The attached trivial preliminary patch (based on 5.3 beta2) fixes this. But I haven't even checked that the documentation actually compiles! Please someone take on the task :-)
