In arb 2.6.0, there is the commit [fix (?) for static build on OS X](https://github.com/fredrik-johansson/arb/commit/fdd858b1c16dc961106604e19eef259272749e5c), indeed touching a line with `ar`. So perhaps the issue disappears with arb 2.6.0. Ticket #18560 contains the upgrade to arb 2.6.0. I have no access to OS X, so I cannot test it myself.
