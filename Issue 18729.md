Replying to [comment:3 slabbe]:
> The branch does not apply cleanly.

Branch merges without any problems. This is a "problem" of trac (git-plugin or something similar), which does not detect that git merge will be successful. No extra merge commit of 6.9.beta1 is needed; thus set back to "needs review"
