Notice the following line in your patch for the README file:

```
# Trac 10865: update copyright years to include 2011
```

This would be interpreted by Mercurial as a comment on a patch file, and not as a commit message as you intended. The hash "#" followed by a space is Mercurial's magic pattern for delimiting a comment. For example:

```
[mvngu@sage sage-4.7.alpha4]$ hg qimport http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/10865/trac-10865_copyright-README.patch && hg qpush

```

Thus the content for the "summary:" line should be

```
summary:     Trac 10865: update copyright years to include 2011
```

instead of

```
summary:     imported patch trac-10865_copyright-README.patch
```

To rectify the situation, simply remove the string "# ".

The given path is wrong if you apply the patch from `SAGE_ROOT`. Note that `SAGE_ROOT` was recently put under revision control, whereas `data/extcode` has been under revision control for many years now. During that time, `data/extcode` was and still is its own Mercurial repository, separate from everything else that is under revision control. So to apply a patch to `data/extcode`, you would need to do

```
$ cd data/extcode
```

and then apply the patch. Here's an illustration:
