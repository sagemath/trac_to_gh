CC:  saliola galen-dorp tscrim tkarn

Keywords: days99, IMA Coding Sprints, hyperplane arrangements, intersection poset

The elements of the intersection poset of a hyperplane arrangement are labelled 0 ... cardinality of intersection poset, but this does not provide information about the intersections.

We'll be posting a fix soon.

Looks good to me. Regarding doctests, I have two comments:

You are writing `sorted(L, key=sorted)` at few places in doctests. I have never seen something like this. Why just `sorted(L)` is not sufficient?

You are writing `. ::` at the end of paragraphs. I think this creates consecutive punctuations `. :` in the html doc. If the `::` appears on its own line, then no `:` are created in place of it in the html doc. Please tell me if I am wrong about this or please inform me so that I improve my knowledge of the Restructured text syntax.
