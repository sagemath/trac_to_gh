# Issue 28024: provide better labels for intersection poset of a hyperplane arrangement

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28261

Original creator: saliola

Original creation time: 2019-07-25 16:16:28

CC:  saliola galen-dorp tscrim tkarn

Keywords: days99, IMA Coding Sprints, hyperplane arrangements, intersection poset

The elements of the intersection poset of a hyperplane arrangement are labelled 0 ... cardinality of intersection poset, but this does not provide information about the intersections.

We'll be posting a fix soon.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to geometry.

Should we really keep the previous output, or should we change it to a new default?

This doctest:

```
+            sage: map(sorted, L.level_sets())
+            [[0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]]
```

will probably not work on py3 because `map` has been changed to return an iterator. Better rewrite as a list comprehension.

Thanks for catching that! I've replaced it with a list comprehension.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Looks good to me. Regarding doctests, I have two comments:

You are writing `sorted(L, key=sorted)` at few places in doctests. I have never seen something like this. Why just `sorted(L)` is not sufficient?

You are writing `. ::` at the end of paragraphs. I think this creates consecutive punctuations `. :` in the html doc. If the `::` appears on its own line, then no `:` are created in place of it in the html doc. Please tell me if I am wrong about this or please inform me so that I improve my knowledge of the Restructured text syntax.

La syntaxe avec `. ::` est correcte, voir

https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#literal-blocks

L'utilisation de `sorted(L, ley=sorted)` me semble ok pour un ensemble d'ensembles.

Par contre, le doctest de la ligne 811 ne passe pas chez moi. ==> **Needs Work**

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

The doctest on line 811 fails because the two coordinate hyperplanes (the rank-1 elements of the lattice) are swapped. In the doctest, the hyperplane with normal vector [1,0] is written to appear before the hyperplane with normal vector [0,1], while the `._list` attribute, called by `sorted`, lists the hyperplane with normal vector [0,1] before the other. 

So it seems to me like the fix is to fix the doctest, not any bugs in the code.

I agree with just modifying the doctest.

Here is a slightly modified version where we build the Hasse diagram of the intersection poset at the same time as we build the poset to avoid comparisons of the affine subspaces. So this should be faster, but I haven't run any tests.

This should deal with the fact that we were trying to sort a poset. This should give it a linear order (coming from that matrices have a linear ordering).
