I'm not sure this is a bug or a feature:

```
sage: max(x^2, 2*x^2)
x^2
sage: max(2*x^2, x^2)
2*x^2
```

Feature.

```
sage: max(x,x^2)
x
sage: max(x^2,x)
x^2
sage: max_symbolic(x,x^2)
max(x, x^2)
sage: max_symbolic(x^2,x)
max(x^2, x)
sage: max_symbolic(x^2,x).subs(x=.5)
0.500000000000000
sage: max_symbolic(x,x^2).subs(x=.5)
0.500000000000000
sage: max_symbolic(x^2,x).subs(x=2)
4
sage: max_symbolic(x,x^2).subs(x=2)
4
```

This comes up pretty frequently, but since `max` is a Python built-in, we can't really override it easily in the "right" way for this to work differently, and it would probably be bad to add a little message about "if you really want..." since often max is just the right thing.

Oh, that would be awesome.  Quality references for these kinds of things are worth so much for Sage.
