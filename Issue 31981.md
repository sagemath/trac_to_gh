my only concern is about the respect of 80 columns mode for comments

```diff
-    - ``solver`` -- (default: ``None``) Specify a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
-      (MILP) solver to be used. If set to ``None``, the default one is used. For more
-      information on MILP solvers and which default solver is used, see the
-      method :meth:`solve
-      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the class
-      :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
-      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.
-
-    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- parameter for use with MILP solvers over an
-      inexact base ring; see :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.
+    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed
+      Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to
+      ``None``, the default one is used. For more information on MILP
+      solvers and which default solver is used, see the method
+      :meth:`solve
+      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the
+      class :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
+      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.
+
+    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
+      solvers over an inexact base ring; see
+      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`
```

So something like that in a easier to copy/paste form

```
    - ``solver`` -- string (default: ``None``); specify a Mixed
      Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to be used. If set to
      ``None``, the default one is used. For more information on MILP
      solvers and which default solver is used, see the method
      :meth:`solve
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.solve>` of the
      class :class:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram
      <sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram>`.

    - ``integrality_tolerance`` -- float; parameter for use with MILP
      solvers over an inexact base ring; see
      :meth:`MixedIntegerLinearProgram.get_values`.
```

For me it's OK like that.
