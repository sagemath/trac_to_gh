I'm not up to review this, but I do have two questions:
1. Why not remove `-ba-force` if it is exactly the same as `-ba`? At least its description should be updated.
2. In `find_python_sources` and `installed_files_by_module` the use `os.chdir` seems uneeded. Can we just use a different argument to `os.walk`?

I think you can remove the `sdist` variable entirely from `setup.py`, i.e., also

Is that (still) used anywhere in Sage?  (I mean calling *Sage's* `setup.py` with `sdist`.)

Mostly looks good, I haven't checked cython modules, but it doesn't seem like it really handles them at the moment (which would agree with some TODO I think I read in the documentation of some function). Are you planning on adding support for them at the moment, or on a future ticket?

I added a few minor reviewer changes.
