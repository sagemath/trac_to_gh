You've broken `./bootstrap -s`. 

```
$ ./bootstrap
... # this is OK, but then
$ ./bootstrap -s

oops, I take it back.
I forgot that after `./boostrap` I commited the updated package version...
(what I would have done with the previous version).

OK, cool. I tried downloading, it works. But note that now the semantics of `-u` is different, it's not the full tarball name, but just the directory. Please correct the
corresponding description in the head of the file, i.e.

```
# If optional argument -u <URL>, where URL is an URL for the configure
# tarball, is given, download it to upstream/. Implies -D.
```

should says something like 

```
# If optional argument -u <URL>, where URL is the directory to get
# the configure tarball for the version specified by package-version.txt,
# is given, download it to upstream/. Implies -D.
```


With this changed, please feel free to flip this to positive review.
