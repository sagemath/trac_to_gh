# Issue 27040: spkg-configure.m4 for ncurses and readline

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27277

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2019-02-13 21:30:59

CC:  embray fbissey

Keywords: spkg-configure

use pkg-config and test that the versions are as new as in Sage:

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([ncurses], [
    dnl First try checking for ncurses with pkg-config
    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([NCURSES], [ncurses >= 6.0], [sage_spkg_install_ncurses=no], [sage_spkg_install_ncurses=yes])
    ])
```

and

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([readline], [
    dnl First try checking for readline with pkg-config
    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([READLINE], [readline >= 6.3], [sage_spkg_install_readline=no], [sage_spkg_install_readline=yes])
    ])
```

test for use_tioctl to recognise ncurses version 6.


---

Comment by embray created at 2019-04-17 16:17:23

?  Do we even need that if we can use PKG_CHECK_MODULES?  Or do you mean for OSX?

For the time being I don't even really care that much about this working on OSX but if you or someone else wants to make it work I certainly won't complain as long as it doesn't make things enormously more complex.

macos native ncurses is OK, but readline is a faked one, libedit, with many functions from readline missing.
Homebrew provides readline 8.0 linked with native macos ncurses.
So we can try to replicate this.

OK, so this works on OSX - with native ncurses and readline built by Sage.

Perhaps the readline version bump is not needed.

On Fedora I get this error building python2

```

a patch related to `libtinfo` is still needed. E.g. 

```
--- a/support/shobj-conf
+++ b/support/shobj-conf
@@ -130,6 +130,7 @@ linux*-*|gnu*-*|k*bsd*-gnu-*|freebsd*-gentoo)

+       SHLIB_LIBS='-ltinfo'
        ;;
 
 freebsd2*)
```

fixes the build on Fedora. 

-----

Actually, I have spotted the bug (2, in fact) in the readline source. 

* The first is in the macro [BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/tree/aclocal.m4?h=devel#n951)  in readline's `aclocal.m4` (this is not an autogenerated file, it's hand-written). If `--with-curses` is given to `./configure` then it still first checks `libtermcap`, and if it's installed on the system then `libtinfo` is skipped. After fixing this, one sees `-ltinfo` in `TERMCAP_LIB` variable, as it should be.
 
* It's not enough to fix the above, as `TERMCAP_LIB` is only used on cygwin/mingw, for a reason I fail to comprehend. Setting [SHLIB_LIBS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/tree/support/shobj-conf?h=devel#n45) to `'$(TERMCAP_LIB)'` unconditionally seems to be the right thing.

The thing works on OSX as there there is an unconditional `SHLIB_LIBS='-lncurses'`.

Should this be reported upstream?

It feels like an upstream work around mostly but the stuff on fedora is probably worth reporting. I very much doubt it is fedora specific. Looking at the gentoo ebuild we have that telling section for readline 8.0

```
	# Force ncurses linking. #71420
	# Use pkg-config to get the right values. #457558
	local ncurses_libs=$($(tc-getPKG_CONFIG) ncurses --libs)
	sed -i \
		-e "/^SHLIB_LIBS=/s:=.*:='${ncurses_libs}':" \
		support/shobj-conf || die
	sed -i \
		-e "/^[[:space:]]*LIBS=.-lncurses/s:-lncurses:${ncurses_libs}:" \
		examples/rlfe/configure || die

	# fix building under Gentoo/FreeBSD; upstream FreeBSD deprecated
	# objformat for years, so we don't want to rely on that.
	sed -i -e '/objformat/s:if .*; then:if true; then:' support/shobj-conf || die

	ln -s ../.. examples/rlfe/readline || die # for local readline headers
```

No, I really don't see how the upstream stuff can work correctly---of course one can like an idiot insert `-ltinfo` everywhere `-lreadline` appears, but this does not make it right.

No, it's readline's "not overlinking" (I'd rather call it "blatant underlinking)
policy, plus "always try termcap first", see
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2014-04/msg00024.html
(underlinking is very bad IMHO, it potentially means that a wrong termcap lib is used, resulting in all sorts of hiccups).

I just sent a followup there, but I don't have much hope for accepting this as bugs on upstream side.

I'll test this on Cygwin once I've confirmed that some other build failures introduced by #27212 are fixed (#27713 and #27714 so far...).

I don't expect any problems though, at least not with the system lib.  Less sure about readline-8.0.  My Cygwin still has readline 7.0.

please support me arguing against underlinking here: http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2019-04/msg00013.html :-)

And with readline version 4 GAP doesn't build:

```
ld: error: undefined symbol: rl_bind_keyseq
>>> referenced by sysfiles.c:2343 (src/sysfiles.c:2343)
>>>               obj/src/.libs/sysfiles.o:(initreadline)
```


So we need `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` on `rl_bind_keyseq`.

I'd like to postpone update to readline 8, see if we can do with what we have now.

oops,now I recall that I forgot to update readline's patches, as a result it won't build with external ncurses (unless there is a library named `libtinfo`).

Works well on macOS Mojave: ncurses is not built, readline is built.

please test this as a part of #27825 - where I merged this and libgd with its deps.
