Keywords: polyhedron

As mentioned in ticket:16045#comment:22 it would be desirable to get the affine hull of a polyhderon, while preserving the polyhedron isometrically (instead of applying an affine transformation, that might distort lenght, volumes, angels, etc.). 

I propose to add an option "algorithm" for the `.affine_hull` method for polyhedra. 
This can then be used to correctly calculate volume of non full-diemsional polyhedra, see #16045. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22804

Two quick comments

1) The keyword `algorithm` is very misleading. "Algorithm" refers to a method to compute something not the result itself. Moreover, both constructions are projections. You should find something more coherent! And also describe in the documentation what is the result.

2) I like better the more explicit

```
P.vertices()[0].vector() == P.ambient_space().zero()
```

I was not quite happy with the choice of "algorithm" for a name of the parameter. Now I named the parameter "force_isometry".

This looks like a nice interface, but let me just say that for volume computations it's overkill to compute this (which will lead to a double description computation in the slow "field" backend), when all one needs is to compute a scaling factor for the volume...

Another comment: I don't think this is a suitable test:

```
if self.base_ring() in [ZZ,QQ]
```

because you could as well have some number field that is too small.

```
sage: D = polytopes.dodecahedron()
sage: F = D.faces(2)[0].as_polyhedron()
sage: F.affine_hull(force_isometry=True)
TypeError: QR decomposition unable to compute square roots in Number Field in sqrt5 with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
```

I agree that for volume computations, this is an overkill. (see more on that below)

For other purposes it might still be useful to have. At the moment, it is not possible it is cumbersome to plot a regular tetrahedron, which looks like a regular tetrahedron. With this feature this is really easy. (Same for other polytopes that are most easily defined as non full-dimensional polytopes. 
Therefore I would like to keep this new feature.

I propose to add two new ways to obtain the affine hull: 

- `orthonormal`, which should be simply what has been called isometry above
- `orthogonal`, a scaled version, that uses `gram_schmitt`. From that the scaling factor can be obtained.

Now I wonder where to store or return the scaling factor. 

Would the following be a reasonable way to do it:
have a method like


```
def affine_hull(self, mode= "default", return_scaling_factor=False)
```


Here `mode` can take values `"default"`, `"orthogonal"`, `"orthonormal"`.
If `return_scaling_factor` is True, then instead of returning simply the polyhedron, return a pair (polyhedron, scaling factor).


I am not quite happy with the names "`mode`" and `"return_scaling_factor"`, I am sure we can find better alternatives.


What do you think?

How about returning the map that sends the result back to the space, instead of returning the factor? Then document how the volume transforms, with an example.

Instead of `mode`, I guess one could just use two boolean keyword parameters.

    "body": "Thanks again, for looking at the ticket, Vincent!\n\nI have now updated the code to make sure that the base ring is never changed (and removed the note).\n\nBefore that it was never extended, but sometimes \"simplified\", i.e. restricted to a smaller base ring, if you were lucky. See the following example:\n\n\n```\nsage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)\nsage: sage: P = Polyhedron([2*[K.zero()],2*[sqrt2]]); P\nA 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices\nsage: P.vertices()\n(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (sqrt2, sqrt2))\n```\n\n\npreviously we had:\n\n\n\n```\nA = P.affine_hull(orthonormal=True); A\nA 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices\nsage: A.vertices()\n(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (2))\n```\n\n\nSo the base_ring was changed from `K` to `ZZ`.\n\nNow I changed this to:\n\n\n```\nsage: A = P.affine_hull(orthonormal=True); A\nA 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices\nsage: A.vertices()\n(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (2))\n```\n\n\nalso, I rebased on the current beta...\n\n\nI think there are advantages to both, simplifying the base ring and also to keeping it.\nIt could also be controlled by the `extend` parameter, but the name doesn't quite capture what is going on.\nBut in general I don't think this should be done here, but there should be a general method, which tries to find the smallest base ring possible.

Thanks again, for looking at the ticket, Vincent!

I have now updated the code to make sure that the base ring is never changed (and removed the note).

Before that it was never extended, but sometimes "simplified", i.e. restricted to a smaller base ring, if you were lucky. See the following example:


```
sage: K.<sqrt2> = QuadraticField(2)
sage: sage: P = Polyhedron([2*[K.zero()],2*[sqrt2]]); P
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: P.vertices()
(A vertex at (0, 0), A vertex at (sqrt2, sqrt2))
```


previously we had:



```
A = P.affine_hull(orthonormal=True); A
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: A.vertices()
(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (2))
```


So the base_ring was changed from `K` to `ZZ`.

Now I changed this to:


```
sage: A = P.affine_hull(orthonormal=True); A
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in (Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2)^1 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices
sage: A.vertices()
(A vertex at (0), A vertex at (2))
```


also, I rebased on the current beta...


I think there are advantages to both, simplifying the base ring and also to keeping it.
It could also be controlled by the `extend` parameter, but the name doesn't quite capture what is going on.
But in general I don't think this should be done here, but there should be a general method, which tries to find the smallest base ring possible. (This might be usefull for demoting rational polytopes to integer ones, but also from AA to some smaller field.)

I feel it is good enough. I just launched the patchbot to see how it goes.

Concerning ring/field simplification there should be something at the level of fields. Such method would also be useful on matrices for example.
