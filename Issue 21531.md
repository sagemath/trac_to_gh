CC:  @tscrim

Add vertical composition of lattices, i.e. the ordinal sum of `A` and `B` with the top of `A` and bottom of `B` unified.

(Code done, waits for new beta, as there are already some tickets waiting to be integrated to `lattices.py`.)

(Add `is_[meet|join]_distributive()` to index of functions with this.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21768

OK for me. (But you forgot a colon, and when I corrected that, I noticed that I had added another `SEEALSO` block to a function already having one.)

I have no preference between `b_K` and `\bottom_K`, but now they are different in this and `star_product` in `posets.py`. To be resolved later.

Ah, I didn't notice that. I don't quite like the result of `\bot_k`, but its a very weak opinion. Feel free to change.

I have no opinion at all, so even a weak opinion is enought to use `b_K`. And `\bot` is kind of used already in `is_orthocomplemented`.
