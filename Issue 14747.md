Currently, trying to plot a function which uses mpmath and returns a complex number in the plotting domain will return an error. For example,


```
sage: from sage.libs.mpmath import utils

The patch fixes the problem by making `call` in `libs.mpmath.utils` return the `complex` type if a complex number is returned from the mpmath call and `float` is the parent. This is consistent with the behaviour for Sage types, as the documentation explains: "the result will be coerced to P (or the corresponding complex field if necessary)".

What are the possible inputs of the `parent` keyword? For example, it will still crash if `parent=int` or `parent=Integer`. I think it should be modified to return `complex(y)` only after either doing something like this

```
    try:
        return parent(y)
    except TypeError:
        if hasattr(parent, 'complex_field'):
            return parent.complex_field()(y)
        else:
            return complex(y)
```

or, by doing something like this:

```
    try:
        return parent(y)
    except TypeError:
        try:
            return parent.complex_field()(y)
        except AttributeError:
            return complex(y)
```


*Edit*: The second `except` is fixed to be for `AttributeError`.

Yes, but I don't think it should work with `parent` as `int` or `Integer`. Your solution coerces anything it doesn't know what to do with into `complex`, which is probably not what we want it to do. Besides, there isn't really any reason it should receive `int` or `Integer` as a parent; a symbolic function's `_evalf_` shouldn't ever get passed that.

With the patch, if `float` is the parent and it gets complex output then it coerces to `complex`, which makes sense since it is has the same precision and is also a Python builtin type. I think the scope of the patch should be to just fix this issue, which affects plotting as noted in the description.

Okay, this new patch returns the original error message instead of giving a cryptic one. So, for example, if `Integer` is given as a parent:


```
sage: utils.call(mpmath.log, -3.0r, parent=Integer)
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'> to an integer
sage: utils.call(mpmath.log, -10.0r, parent=int)
TypeError: can't convert complex to int; use int(abs(z))
```


What do you think of this solution? I think it makes the most sense.
