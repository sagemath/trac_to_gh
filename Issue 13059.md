Define is_atomic to check whether a lattice is atomic. There seems to be some ambiguity as to what 'atomic' means. Wikipedia makes a distinction between atomic posets, where each element lies above an atom, and 'atomistic' lattices, where every element is a join of atoms. This is_atomic checks the latter, which coincides with Stanley's usage in EC1.

* You should not remove the :: after EXAMPLES:: in the complements method.

* Maybe add the reference to Stanley ?

Oops. It was complemented, not is_complemented whose docstring I had messed up, so the attachment description is wrong.
