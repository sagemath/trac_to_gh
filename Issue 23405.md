CC:  swewers roed

Currently, factorization is broken over fraction fields:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^3 + a
sage: f.factor()
x^3 + a
sage: (x - a + 1)^3
x^3 + a
```

The problem really seems to boil down to the problem described in #17697:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3(t)
// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    a x
//        block   2 : ordering C
// quotient ring from ideal
_[1]=a2-a-1
```


Singular's `factorize()` is ignoring the quotient ring. However, if we omit the fraction field, then our code does not use the quotient ring construction and factorization works:

```
sage: R.<x> = k[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3[a]/(a^2-a-1)
// number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

There seems to be nothing we can do about this while using Singular. Singular does not seem to support function fields over non-prime finite fields.

It seems that we have to fall back to our own function field factorization code here.

Wouldn't it be better to fix the way the singular ring is created?
