# Issue 23405: Factorization over fraction fields incorrect

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently, factorization is broken over fraction fields:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^3 + a
sage: f.factor()
x^3 + a
sage: (x - a + 1)^3
x^3 + a
```

The problem really seems to boil down to the problem described in #17697:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3(t)
// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    a x
//        block   2 : ordering C
// quotient ring from ideal
_[1]=a2-a-1
```


Singular's `factorize()` is ignoring the quotient ring. However, if we omit the fraction field, then our code does not use the quotient ring construction and factorization works:

```
sage: R.<x> = k[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3[a]/(a^2-a-1)
// number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

There seems to be nothing we can do about this while using Singular. Singular does not seem to support function fields over non-prime finite fields.

It seems that we have to fall back to our own function field factorization code here.

I'll try to take a look at this this week at Sage Days 88.

Hoping that this branch was accidentally deleted....

Yes. I don't know why this happens.

Wouldn't it be better to fix the way the singular ring is created?
I'l try to have a look.

I tried that but I do not think that it's possible. It seems that you can not create `(k[a]/(g(a)))(t)[x]` in Singular; as far as I understand in Singular that would be `Frac(k[a,t]/(g(a)))[t]` in Singular but then Singular complains that `g` is not univariate. You can only realize this with a "quotient ring", but these are ignored in factorizations.

Ok, I'll trust you on that one as I won't have time before a couple of weeks to have a look.

Thanks. I am not a Singular expert by any means but I tried the ways that I could think of from looking at the Singular documentation and I guess there is also a reason why someone used this quotient ring construction in the first place.

All tests pass for me on k8s.  Looks good.
