Don't use magic numbers like ` # 3 means !=`. Use `Py_NE` for that instead.

And `int_cmp` should be an inline function in the `.pxd` file.

You can replace `richcmp_not_equal(rows1, rows2, Py_LT)` by `rows1 < rows2` which is equivalent but a lot more readable. Don't forget to remove the cimports too.
