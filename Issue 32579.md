```
sage -t --long --random-seed=43805222569518434108329399959452339425 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py", line 783, in sage.rings.polynomial.polynomial_element_generic.Polynomial_generic_sparse.quo_rem
Failed example:
    f.quo_rem(g)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ArithmeticError: Division non exact (consider coercing to polynomials over the fraction field)
Got:
    (-y^5 + 2*y^2, y^3 - 2*x^2*y^2 - y)

(From a patchbot run in #32380.)

Took a while to understand what the doctest is about.

Thing is, Euclidean algorithm may still work, if the leading coefficient is not a unit, e.g.
`25*x^2 + 5*x` is divisible by `5*x`. Its a bit like claiming, that integers cannot be divided...
