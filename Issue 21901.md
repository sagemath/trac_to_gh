The commands


```
var('n')
assume(n,'integer')
integral(x^n*sin(x),x)
```


produce the output


```
1/4*(((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, I*x) - ((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, -I*x))*(-1)^(-1/2*n)
```


which is identically zero for `n` even. Possibly an issue with branches of exponential integrals. Possibly related to #17968.
