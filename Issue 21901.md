# Issue 21901: Wrong Maxima integral result for even exponents

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22138

Original creator: paulmasson

Original creation time: 2017-01-04 22:53:22

The commands


```
var('n')
assume(n,'integer')
integral(x^n*sin(x),x)
```


produce the output


```
1/4*(((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, I*x) - ((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, -I*x))*(-1)^(-1/2*n)
```


which is identically zero for `n` even. Possibly an issue with branches of exponential integrals. Possibly related to #17968.

Don't forget to report upstream if possible.
