# Issue 31141: Create a new module for morphic words

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31378

Original creator: jlepsova

Original creation time: 2021-02-11 07:33:09

CC:  vdelecroix

The aim is to make the following computations take less time. 



```
sage: m = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->a')
sage: w = m.fixed_point('a')
sage: w
word: abaababaabaababaababaabaababaabaababaaba...
sage: %time w[1000]
CPU times: user 1.45 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 1.45 ms
Wall time: 1.45 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[10000]
CPU times: user 82.9 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 82.9 ms
Wall time: 82.1 ms
'a'
sage: %time w[100000]
CPU times: user 5.19 s, sys: 6.26 ms, total: 5.2 s
Wall time: 5.19 s
'b'
sage: %time w[1000000]
CPU times: user 12min 45s, sys: 93.4 ms, total: 12min 45s
Wall time: 12min 45s
'a'
```

Let's close #31370 and keep this one (Jana is learning how to contribute to Sage).

I rebased the branch on top of `9.3.beta7`. I also added a commit which links the new module added by Jana to the existing sage words library.

Jana, the next step is to update the examples in the documentation in the `morphic.py` file.

With the current branch,


```
$ sage -bt src/sage/combinat/words/morphic.py 
```


returns


```

I fixed the doctests with respect to saving the objects (loads, dumps, reduce, etc.).

It remains only one issue:


```
            sage: m = WordMorphism("a->ab,b->")          
            sage: w = m.fixed_point("a")                                      
            sage: w.representation(0)                
            []                                      
            sage: w.representation(1)             
            [1]                         
            sage: w.representation(2)  #infinite loop
```


Jana: can you take a look at this?

Does the most recent commit also handles the following infinite loop?

```
sage: m = WordMorphism("a->ab,b->,c->cdab,d->dcab")
sage: w = m.fixed_point("a")
sage: w.representation(2)
```


What is the remaining problem you mention in the commit message? Can you provide an example?


In the following, the multiplication `vMk*M` is computed twice. Maybe you want to write `vMk1 = vMk*M` to represent `vM^{k+1}` and at the end of the loop, you may do `vMk = vMk1`.


```diff
         while vMk[position] <= n:
+            if vMk == vMk*M:
+                raise ValueError('The morphism has a finite fixed point of length {}.'.format(vMk[position]))
             vMk = vMk*M
             length_of_images.append(vMk)
```


I would suggest that the error message also include the value of `n`. Something like `IndexError: index (=2) out of range, the fixed point is finite and has length 2`.

I think the error should be an `IndexError` instead of `ValueError`, as it is for strings:


```
sage: s = 'ab'                                                                  
sage: s[2]                                                                      
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 s[Integer(2)]

```

I fixed the remaining issue. Should be okay now.

I added a reference. I need to learn the new way of adding reference to sage...

I just did two commits that I pushed on the branch u/slabbe/31378_on_9.4.beta0. I prefer to make sure it works on beta3 since we modify the references/index.rst file, it could be the case that there is a conflict. I am currently building beta3. I will update the branch later.

`make` finishes with "Sage build/upgrade complete!", on my side. So no problems related to the changes in the references list.

There are a lot of trailing whitespaces.

What is the purpose of this commented line

```
         # self._func = callable
```


Why did you put

```
+.. [BR2010b] Valérie Berthé and Michel Rigo, editors. Combinatorics, automata,
+             and number theory, volume 135. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.
```

after

```
 
+.. [Br1910] Bruckner, "Uber die Ableitung der allgemeinen Polytope und
+            die nach Isomorphismus verschiedenen Typen der allgemeinen
+            Achtzelle (Oktatope)", Verhand. Konik. Akad. Wetenschap,
+            Erste Sectie, 10 (1910)
```

With respect to the lexicographic ordering `Berthe < Bruckner`.

Are you sure that `Computing the n-th letter of a fixed point is fast`? If the morphism is primitive then I agree but otherwise...


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2021-09-30 09:20:44

Here is an example

```
sage: s = WordMorphism('0->011,1->1')
sage: w = s.fixed_point('0')
sage: w # very stupid word :-)
word: 0111111111111111111111111111111111111111...
sage: w.representation(1000000) # now you can wait !!
```


EDIT: Computing the representation is long (because the answer is long) but computing `w[1000000]` should be fast.

More generally, when the growth of `|sigma^n(letter)|` is polynomial (and not exponential) then going via the representation is not a good idea.

Replying to [comment:32 vdelecroix]:
> More generally, when the growth of `|sigma^n(letter)|` is polynomial (and not exponential) then going via the representation is not a good idea.

Well if the growth rate of the `|sigma^n(letter)|` is quadratic this ticket does an improvement. Here is an example:

On 9.5.beta0:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism('a->abc,b->bc,c->c')                                     
sage: w = s.fixed_point('a')                                                    
sage: %time w[1000000]                                                          
CPU times: user 6.45 s, sys: 11.5 ms, total: 6.46 s
Wall time: 6.46 s
'c'
```


On 9.5.beta0 + #31378:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism('a->abc,b->bc,c->c')                                     
sage: w = s.fixed_point('a')                                                    
sage: %time w[1000000]                                                          
CPU times: user 28.5 ms, sys: 51 µs, total: 28.6 ms
Wall time: 28.4 ms
'c'
```


Here it grows quadratically:


```
sage: for i in range(10): u = s('a', i); print(len(u), u)                       
1 a
3 abc
6 abcbcc
10 abcbccbccc
15 abcbccbcccbcccc
21 abcbccbcccbccccbccccc
28 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbcccccc
36 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbccccccc
45 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbcccccccbcccccccc
55 abcbccbcccbccccbcccccbccccccbcccccccbccccccccbccccccccc
```


The problem is when the images grow linearly. Question: can we detect that?

The answer is yes, see #32594.

We can do that later on.

I think the issue with trailing whitespaces was mainly with file morphic.py. I removed those from that file.


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2021-09-30 16:02:14

there are more in `morphism.py`.


---

Comment by slabbe created at 2021-09-30 18:52:37

Do you want me to remove all of the trailing whitespaces in the file, or only those in lines that were changed?


---

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2021-09-30 20:20:27

That is fine with me either way.
