This interface is running on a heavily ageing SGI server. The software providing the interface is completely unmaintained. When this server dies, the Inverse Symbolic Calculator will be gone.

There is a new version of this, apparently supported by both Maplesoft and NSERC, at [this link](http://glooscap.cs.dal.ca:8087/standard).  So maybe this is doable after all - we already have an interface for Wolfram integrator, for instance.

I am sure that their names are only there because the work was done on grants funded by them. Jon Borwein is no longer at Dalhousie and I don't think there is much of his group left there either. You'll be interfacing with unmaintained code.

Ok, then let's work hard so that you could have used it last week `:-P`

Well, I wrote a few lines of code and it "works", but there are some problems for which I would like everybody's advice.


```
sage: ask_ISC(3.14)                         
Asking ISC what it knows about 3.14000000000000
No result found in ISC
```


That's the first problem : 3.14, for Sage, is equal to 3.1400000000. Which, for ISC, is totally different.

There's a way out if we only feed the function with a string instead, but it's not a good way out for it should ultimately be a method of Sage constants...

Second problem, which is just technical : where should this method appear ? Where in the code ? Or should it appear nowhere, and just be available as a function in a module ?

Then, the output.


```
sage: ask_ISC("3.14")
Asking ISC what it knows about 3.14
3140000117869847 sin(Pi*4/35)*sin(Pi*19/54)
3140000181376111 Lehmer^sr(Pi)/2^(1/3)
3140000375403483 sum(1/(5^n+(31/2*n^2-27/2*n+51)),n=1..inf)
3140000446459760 (K(1/sr(2))+GAM(5/24))^Golomb
3140000895104510 GAM(2/3)-Li4(1/2)^ln(Pi)
3140001879986726 (exp(1/Pi)+5)/(-arctan(1/2)+2/3)
...
```


I don't think that it would make sense to return a Python object for I have no idea what one could want to do with it automatically. Most of the symbolic formulas have no meaning in Sage, so it's really just for the user to see. Right now the method returns nothing and just prints the result. The only think that may be cool to add would be a nice way to display such results in the notebook, but I would like to hear your advice on the possible outputs too `:-)`

And you can try this small patch if you want in the meantime.

Have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnn !!!

The function `algdep` can help identify algebraic numbers.

It would be nice to be able to identify transcendental
expressions as well.
