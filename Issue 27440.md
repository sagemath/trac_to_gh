I noticed that the Docker build-from-clean jobs still build packages like zlib even though it can be avoided since the work done so far on#27330 so long as the correct system headers installed in the build container.

On one hand, while I think it's good to test full builds of Sage-the-distribution with all SPKGs enabled, I think that's more a job for the Buildbot fleet, whereas for Docker images we want to avoid as much overhead as possible.

For now the savings are small (just a few small libraries like zlib and libffi).  But as we continue to make progress (e.g. with #27212) the savings will become more significant.

Thoughts?

`build-from-clean` is only called very rarely so it's not that important when looking at runtime. I guess that using system provided libraries might make the resulting image a bit smaller.

In any case, I agree that building everything from scratch is what the buildbots are good for. So removing things from build-from-clean appears to be a good idea.

Agreed.

Yes, small(er) docker images are preferable, in particular, if this is kind of easily possible by using system libraries.

Not *that* rarely though, and it will still save significant time in the long term.

I don't think it will make images *much* smaller, but certainly a little bit.

If I understand correctly one problem we're having in the docker builds is that when running `make build` in the `sagemath/sagemath-dev` image more and more stuff over time has been getting rebuilt.

This seems to be directly related to #27330, as the packages getting rebuilt in the docker image are those that can now be used from the system.  So it seems like, possibly, there is a bug (either in the build system, or in the Dockerfiles) causing these packages to be rebuilt (even if they were already built rather than using the system copies).  Strange.

I think probably just using the system packages in the first place would avoid this, but that's not entirely clear either.
