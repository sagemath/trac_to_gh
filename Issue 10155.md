W.r.t. making new dists from an upgraded version, hopefully #9433 solves this... ;-)

(I don't know if you meant upgrading in general; this works for me. You just still have the old `makefile`.)

Nobody should do this, currently.

We should perhaps just give an error message in that case (until #9433 is merged).

Of course. But I would *rename* it because (POSIX) `make` gives `makefile` precedence over `Makefile` and we don't want to cause confusion.

On the other hand, if `makefile` and `Makefile` are identical files, it shouldn't matter.  It seems just dangerous to delete `makefile` during a Sage build/upgrade.

Can any of you implement this?

Note that on OS X, you can't have files called both "makefile" and "Makefile" in the same directory.  Also, "makefile" is not used at all during an upgrade, so it should be safe to rename it.

> Can any of you implement this?


It's taken care of by #9433.  If we want to implement it here, I think it should be done in the sage-upgrade script, after running "./install" and checking its exit status:

Another option would also check for the existence of 'Makefile' before doing the move:

```

The first two patches (10156_docs.patch and 10156_scripts.patch) get a positive review from me.

This doesn't work, probably my fault.  The issue is that the script "sage-upgrade" doesn't get upgraded in the process.  So I think moving makefile should happen at the end of the "install" script instead, since this gets downloaded before it gets run.  (In particular, upgrading didn't rename "makefile" when I tested it.)  Try this patch to "install" instead.

These are all in the *output* directory.  Could it be that you did not rebuild the pdf documentation after applying these tickets and are finding the old tex files?

Yes, it is very possible. I'm just going to build Sage again from scratch, as I've messed around with various files. But I very much doubt I built the pdfs, so that explains it.
