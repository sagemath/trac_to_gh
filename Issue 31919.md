In Cygwin on a Windows 10 laptop,
Sage 9.4.beta4 build also failed on pynac.

Clueless but happy to try things.

A first thing would be to try if a Singular update helps (by preparing the upgrade ticket #32001), although when I looked in the Singular log I neither saw a change that could have broken it again on Cygwin, nor a change that would have fixed it again...
