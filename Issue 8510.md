# Issue 8510: conjugacy_class(es)_representatives

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8510

Original creator: bump

Original creation time: 2010-03-12 19:05:37

Assignee: AlexGhitza

The group SL(2,3) has a method conjugacy_class_representatives()
while the group DiCyclicGroup(3) has a method
conjugacy_classes_representatives(). These names are similar but not
identical. Presumably one should be changed.
