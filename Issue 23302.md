It would be good if you also brought the documentation up to standards (some things need to be code formatted, removing periods in `INPUT`'s, etc.).

Something done. However, the most needed thing is documenting input variables... At least for now I can not do that.

If you fix the documentation, could you add it to the reference manual too?

```diff
diff --git a/src/doc/en/reference/groups/index.rst b/src/doc/en/reference/groups/index.rst
index 204c3cc..1d28cc2 100644

I don't see line `sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures` in `src/doc/en/reference/groups/index.rst`.

You need 8.1.beta8 for that.
