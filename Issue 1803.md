# Issue 1803: Add HISTORY.txt to $SAGE_ROOT

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: mabshoff

Original creation time: 2008-01-17 19:35:56

Assignee: mabshoff

HISTORY.txt contains all release notes from "Thu Apr 7 15:59:18 2005" until Sage 2.9.3. It will need more cleanup, but this is a good first approximation.

Cheers,

Michael
