There should be a parent in Sage for p-maximal orders within number fields.  When we add completions, these will be a natural parent to complete to get rings of integers in p-adic fields.

In particular, the `change` method introduced in #20310 uses `ring_of_integers`, which can be expensive once p-adic extension fields can arise as completions of number fields.  Once p-maximal orders exist, `change` should be changed accordingly.
