Assignee: mabshoff

In particular, the note at the bottom of http://www.sagemath.org/doc/inst/node5.html claims that gcc 4.3 doesn't work yet.

But probably somebody who knows the current status (that is, mabshoff) should review the entire manual; there are probably lots of other things in there that are wrong now.

The documentation has been fixed a while ago, the problem is #5190, i.e. the documentation on sage.math never got properly updated since October or so last year.

Cheers,
