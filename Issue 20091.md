In `numerical/backends/generic_backend.pyx` the following doctest (line 1153) is wrong if gurobi is available

```
sage: default_mip_solver("GUROBI")
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Gurobi is not available. Please refer to the documentation to install it.
```

Some of these were fixed in #19525.

Here's a fix for the remaining failures with Gurobi.

mip.pyx is no longer testing with the default MIP solver; now always uses GLPK. Testing with the default MIP solver seems like a bad idea. We'll ensure consistency of the backends using the new backend testsuite introduced in #20323, #20424.

I've tested with current Gurobi and current CPLEX on Mac OS X.
All tests pass.
