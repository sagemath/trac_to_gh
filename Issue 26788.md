CC:  @timokau fbissey

In Sage 8.4 we had

```
sage: r.eval("graphics.off()")
''
sage: r.eval("""
....: 1
....: 2
....: """)
'[1] 1\n[1] 2'
```

in Sage 8.5 this gives

```
sage: r.eval("graphics.off()")
'NULL'
sage: r.eval("""
....: 1
....: 2
....: """)
'[1] 2'
```

which is annoying and inconsistent with the output one gets from R using these commands:

```
> graphics.off()
> 1
[1] 1
> 2
[1] 2
```

I've also seen this example in the documentation:

```
sage: r.png(filename='"%s"'%filename)             # optional -- rgraphics
NULL
```

which again I think is wrong - there should be no NULL output when saving a file.

I agree this should definitely be fixed.

Incidentally, this is the opposite of what I did in the recent updates to the libgap interface (#22626): Previously, void-returning GAP functions would have their "return value" wrapped in a null `GapElement` that actually repr'd as `NULL` which was obviously annoying and distracting.  

In this case, the old behavior still returned an empty string, which still looks wrong to me.  It should check whether the expression in question has an actual return value or not, and if not then `r.eval` should just return `None`.

Right, thanks for reporting. The `eval` function actually just hands of to `rpy2`:


```
def eval(self, code, *args, **kwds):
    self._lazy_init()
    return str(robjects.r(code)).rstrip()
```


In this case `robjects.r("graphics.off()")` is `rpy2.rinterface.NULL`, which unfortunately is implemented to have a string representation of `NULL`. I'd argue this is an upstream bug bug since I think upstream doesn't want to do new python2 releases, we need to fix it ourselves here.

The fix should be trivial. Just add a `if result == rpy2.rinterface.NULL` to `eval`. However do you know why


```
sage: r.png(filename='"%s"'%filename)             # optional -- rgraphics
NULL
```


is different? I didn't touch that in my recent R changes, so that always returned NULL.

No idea about `r.png` returning NULL before and after - I thought it was a recent change.

But apart from NULL there is also change in behaviour for multi-line input. For SageMathCell, that adds that extra graphics command, this means that default output of single commands is not shown at all: https://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwzBAAAMgAy&lang=r Is it easy to restore old behaviour for this case?

For your examples just splitting on newline would work. But the same issue seems to appear any time you eval more than one statement, for example `r.eval("1;3")`.

I'd personally argue that is out of scope for eval, but since it was supported before...

I don't know much about R myself, I only messed with it in the first place because it was stuck on an old version for so long and nobody else was doing anything.

This looks like it could be simplified: If `result != NULL` then you always do `result = str(result)` anyways, so why not just move the `.rstrip()` into the statement in the `else:` block and get rid of the superfluous `isinstance(result, str)`?

I'm also surprised now, upon reading the docs for the eval method, that it *always* returns the result s a string, and not the actual wrapped R object itself (as the libgap interface would do).  Why is this?  That makes me rethink having it ever return `None` in the first place.

I think I had a reason for that, but I can't remember it and I can't see any reason now. So it can probably be changed.

If you wanted a proper object, you'd use `__call__` instead: `r("42")`. Not sure why its done that way, I assume its just a symptom of having been a pexpect interface before. There it was natural to eval first and then translate to an object. Now we do it the other way around: get an object first, then produce a string if requested.

Gap does the same thing:


```
sage: type(gap.eval('42;'))
<type: 'str'>
```

It mostly is. Due to my little R usage and a lack of tests, some issues were probably inevitable. I'm only aware of this issue (the multiline thing may be hard to fix depending on how R handles these) and the multiple instances issue (wontfix from me).

I wouldn't be opposed to deprecating the old api altogether and using rpy2 (maybe a very thin wrapper) instead. But I don't want to fight that fight myself :)
