CC:  slelievre

Keywords: pycodestyle

We fix the following:


```
E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)
E702 multiple statements on one line (semicolon)
W605 invalid escape sequence '\Z'
```


This makes `tox -e pycodestyle-minimal` with the current configuration.

As this touches many files, we split this in several smaller tickets.
