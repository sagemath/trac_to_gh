# Issue 31729: Fix E701, E702, W605 for `tox -e pycodestyle-minimal`

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31966

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2021-06-12 18:55:09

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: pycodestyle

We fix the following:


```
E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)
E702 multiple statements on one line (semicolon)
W605 invalid escape sequence '\Z'
```


This makes `tox -e pycodestyle-minimal` with the current configuration.

As this touches many files, we split this in several smaller tickets.

Thanks for the quick pointer. I didn't really get anything done yet.

I just think it would be nice to have the `lint` badge green per default.

The branch is for reference only.

With those tickets above, `tox -e pycodestyle-minimal` succeeds for me.

Changing component from doctest framework to refactoring.

Maybe component "refactoring" is more adapted than "doctest framework".

I removed the branch, as this is a metaticket

This will probably need one last pass, once all tickets are closed.

The branch was just illustrating that things worked, once everything is merged. Sorry it is confusing.
