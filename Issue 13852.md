Hello!

We have the **adjacency_matrix** and **kirchhoff_matrix** methods for graphs. I am very much missing a method for the distance_matrix since in the current project I am working with requires us to study some algebraic proprieties of the distance matrix.  

It is obviously trivial to implement independently but I am tired of writing distance_matrix(G) all the time.

So before adding a patch implementing that I am wondering if you other guys agree with that and if perhaps I have overlooked that functionality.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14056

So far you can get the distances as a dict of dict but not as a matrix. 

I think it could be useful.

I also think this would be useful.  The dict of dicts is a bit cumbersome to work with sometimes.

Plus, it would be nice to have

- the 0-1 matrix for vertex pairs at distance `i` apart (the adjacency matrix of the distance graphs, which are implemented)

- the actual set (list) of vertices at distance `i` from a given vertex `v`

You might give some thought to the name, I tend to think of "distance matrix" as the 0-1 matrix just above and not the matrix of distances, even though that is a perfectly rational choice.  `matrix_of_distances`?

Hello !

Well, I think that it is a matrix only if all vertices are numbered from 0 to n-1, which is not the case in Sage. The reason why distance_all_pairs returns a dict of dict is precisely because vertices are not necessarily integers.

If you prefer to have a matrix instead, and because I am always scared of the number of functions we have in graph, I would prefer (whatever you want the future name to be.. By the way distance_matrix is nice indeed) that distance_all_pairs disappear, and become an optional result of distance_matrix.

Like `distance_matrix(as_dictionary = True)` ? What do you think of it ?
The point is that `distance_all_pairs` really is `distance_matrix`. Vertices just aren't integers.

I had a lot of wine, and a lot of good duck, and a lot of good cheese. I may make more sense tomorrow. Anyway, have fun ! `:-)`

I agree with distance_matrix returning a matrix and this function could have an argument to return a binary matrix for pairs at distances i. 

I disagree with adjacency_matrix returning the binary matrix, and I don't like the proposition of Nathann of a function called distance_matrix able to return a dictionary.

But Nathann is right that the distance_matrix works only for graphs with vertices labeled from 0 to n-1. A solution is to return the map vertex->int as well.

Hello!

Nathann I don't think its polite to mention your dinner without offering it to us as well!!! At least for the cheese :)))

As for the comments! 

The distance matrix is an algebraic object and is not "affected" by  the ordering of the vertices. In the same manner as the adjacency_matrix does not return a vertex -> int map.

If you still think it makes to return a map then we could add (analogously to the automorphism_group function) an option "translation=True" in order to return such a map as well. We'd need to add this to the adjacency_matrix()  as well for the sake of consistency.

As for the pair at distances k. The adjacency matrix of a graph is defined as the (0,1) matrix such that an entry (i,j) has a 1 if and only if the vertices v_i,v_j are at distance 1. Hence to me it makes pretty much sense to add an option here to generalize this to the case when v_i,v_j are at distance k.

Why don't you agree dcoudert?

Thanks for the comments and have a nice day!

This is a good idea to return map only if an optional argument is set to True. 

For the matrix of vertices at distance k, I don't know which is the best terminology/method. This is also related to the transitive closure of the graph. I let you choose.

You could also have a method returning all such matrices at once to avoid recomputing all the distances.

`O_o`

Well .... How would you get the distance between two vertices of your graph given the adjacency matrix unless you know how they are associated to each other ? `^^;`

We can do that as well, though I would then still like to have a method distance_matrix() calling distance_all_pairs with the appropriate argument. At least for consistency with adjacency,incidence and Kirchhoff matrix.

As for infinity.. Well I like to think of these matrices as well defined algebraic objects and I am not even sure if a matrix can digest Infinity as its entry...

What I meant was that If we choose to put this thing under distance_all_pairs and add an argument returning the distance matrix, then I would still like to have a method called distance_matrix() that would call distance_all_pairs asking for the distance matrix. And I would want to have that since I would like to have a method called distance_matrix() as we do for the other mentioned matrices!

That being said I am now starting to doubt it is a good idea to mix this distance matrix with the shortest path algorithm. Especially if  we don't have the indexed matrix thing and since (apperently) infinity is not digested by matrices.

What do you think

Whaaaattttttt ??`O_o`

"call distance_all_pairs asking for the distance matrix" ? What does that mean ?

What I described above was a function names "distance_matrix" which returns the distance matrix when no optional flags are given, and which returns the current result of "distance_all_pairs" when an optional flag, say `labels = True`, is added to it.

And `distance_all_pairs` would be removed from generic_graph.

What about this ?

> And I would want to have that since I would like to have a method called distance_matrix() as we do for the other mentioned matrices!


Is that still contradicting what I said above ? I don't understand it either.

> That being said I am now starting to doubt it is a good idea to mix this distance matrix with the shortest path algorithm.


Why would we mix "distance matrix" with a shortest path algorithm ? The `distance_all_pairs` method is written in Cython and actually creates a C array filled with the content of the distance matrix.

Oookay now I think I *do* understand you. Somehow I still like it more the way it is structured now (an algorithmically inclined guy would look for the distance_all_pairs method) a math guy for the distance matrix and since we already have the distance_all_pairs method I don't see any good reasons for removing it. 

That said, why would you like this specific change?

Ok, nowwwwwwwww the review !

* Would be nice to add in the documentation that this method ignores edge labels
* You can probably save some time by replacing 

```
for i in xrange(n): 
    for j in xrange(i+1,n): 
        d = (dist[V[i]])[V[j]]

    with

```
for i,Vi in enumerate(V.values()): 
    for j,dj in enumerate(Vi.values()):
        d = dj 
```

    I think that you cannot trust the dictionary for returning its elements in the same ordering on all architectures, but you probably can trust it for always returning its elements in the same ordering on the same machines. Especially when you have several dictionaries containing the very same keys. Would be good to check, though. I'll ask on Sage-devel.

Thinking about it again, if you replace the loop by what I just said, then you cannot save some time by doing `ret[i,j] = ret[j,i] = d` anymore. Hmmmm... `O_o`

Helloooooooooo !!

There were some trailing whitespaces in your patch, and Sage's dogma says that this is wrong. I also added a warning saying that the ordering of vertices in the matrix may not be the ordering of vertices in ``g.vertices()``.

If you agree with this patch, then you can set the ticket to `positive_review` !
