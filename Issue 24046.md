Very useful would be to support list arguments like `ex.has_function([sin,cos,tan], all=True)` and a fast implementation in Pynac. At the moment the functionality can be had by multiple calls to `has(...)` with wildcard expression (not function) arguments.

This needs porting to Python 3 (it's a very old branch...)
it causes 

`TypeError: expected bytes, str found`
