# Issue 26841: Latex version of piecewise is cumbersome

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27078

Original creator: @JCGoran

Original creation time: 2019-01-18 16:32:07

Keywords: latex

The latex produced by the `piecewise` function is rather cumbersome to look at. For instance:

```
sage: var('y'); f = piecewise([((0,1), x^2*y), ([-1,0], -x*y^2)], var=x);
sage: latex(f)
piecewise\left(\left(\left(\text{\texttt{(0,{ }1)}}, x^{2} y\right), \left(\text{\texttt{[{-}1,{ }0]}}, -x y^{2}\right)\right), x\right)
```

which looks very strange when rendered in a document. On the other hand, something like this

```
\operatorname{piecewise}(x) = \begin{cases}x^2y, & x\in (0, 1)\\ -xy^2, & x\in [-1, 0]\\ \end{cases}
```

is much easier to understand when rendered.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
