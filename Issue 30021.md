Keywords: configure, make, quiet, silent

Having set `make` to silent mode eg using

```
MAKE='make -s V=0'
```

one would expect that in cases in which `make` or
`make distclean` calls `./configure`,
it would call it in quiet mode: `./configure -q`.

Before this ticket, that is not the case.

That's a good idea for the `config.status --recheck` that is invoked by `make` sometimes.

Is it the main `Makefile` or `build/make/Makefile` that needs tweaking?

In passing, indentation in `Makefile`s is tabs-only but the main Makefile
has spaces mixed in at line 56.

This `config.status --recheck` seems to happen in two places (and once in the doc).

From the Sage root folder:

```bash
$ git grep "\brecheck\b" .
Makefile:               ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status; \
m4/sage_spkg_collect.m4:                AC_MSG_NOTICE([  \$ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status])
