Keywords: crypto, sbox, lat, linear approximation matrix

as discussed here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/l8N2wQl9WsY I would like to introduce an (optional) argument to the `linear_approximation_matrix` method on S-boxes, that allows to scale the output to the four typical use cases: biases, correlations, absolute biases, and fourier coefficients.

The current implementation returns absolute biases, which would thus be the default value to the `scale` argument.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24819

Hi Friedrich,

You can remove "B" and the nested for-loop. The list "L" can be constructed as

```
L = [ self.component_function(i).walsh_hadamard_transform() for i in range(ncols) ]
```

Regards,
Rusydi

Good catch with the nested for loops, now its much more clearer I think.

I fixed the doc build error, but did not find a syntactic correct way to break the now-too-long lines:

```
    There are three typical notations for this probability used in
    the literature:

    - `Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 1/2 + e(\\alpha, \\beta)`, where `e(\\alpha, \\beta)` is called the bias,
    - `2\cdot Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 1 + c(\\alpha, \\beta)`, where `c(\\alpha, \\beta) = 2\cdot e(\\alpha, \\beta)` is the correlation, and
    - `2^{(n+1)}\cdot Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 2^n + \hat{S}(\\alpha, \\beta)`, where `\hat{S}(\\alpha, \\beta)` is the Fourier coefficient of S.
```

How do I correctly break these last three lines?

You can break it like this :

```
      There are three typical notations for this probability used in
      the literature:
 
      - `Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 1/2 + e(\\alpha, \\beta)`,
        where `e(\\alpha, \\beta)` is called the bias,
      - `2\cdot Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 1 + c(\\alpha, \\beta)`,
        where `c(\\alpha, \\beta) = 2\cdot e(\\alpha, \\beta)` is the correlation, and
      - `2^{(n+1)}\cdot Pr[<\\alpha, x> = <\\beta, S(x)>] = 2^n + \hat{S}(\\alpha, \\beta)`,
        where `\hat{S}(\\alpha, \\beta)` is the Fourier coefficient of S.
```

More comments :

1. Starts the docstring with `r"""`. In this way you can remove all the double backslash in latex notation (e.g. `\\alpha` becomes `\alpha`)
2. You forget the backslash in the definition `A[alpha, beta]` and put them in between backtick
3. Existing notation used for dot product is `\cdot` (e.g, see the description of autocorrelation_matrix() and component function() )
4. Abbreviation LAT does not match with the function's name. I used LAM instead (e.g., see the description of linear_branch_number() ). Although this is somewhat different from standard terminology in literature, this matches the existing function's name to avoid confusion. But I do think in the future we should replace the word "matrix" to "table" in functions' name (initial committer for this module already used the terminology "matrix").

Hi Friedrich,

Please make it clear in the documentation that `m` and `n` refers to the input and output size of the S-Box respectively.

Hi Friedrich,

This is just an opinion, so feel free to disagree. Instead of passing a string to parameter `scale`, why don't we let it to take the scaling factor directly. For instance, instead of calling `S.linear_approximation_matrix(scale="absolute_bias")`, one may call it with `S.linear_approximation_matrix(scale=2)`. There are two advantages for this : it gives a far more flexibility and at the same time we free ourselves from explaining new terminologies associated with whatever scaling factor available in the literature.

In that case, the argument `scale` can be replaced to something like `scale_factor`

I disagree with using a custom scaling factor.

If you actually need to change the factor, you can also easily scale it afterwards anyway.

Additional, having this scaling argument allows for a much clearer docstring, as we can use the common terms from literature to explain the function. I think its important to precisely say what the function returns and for this choosing from the common scalings used in the literature is the best way, I think.

It should also be quite unlikely that there will be a new scaling factor introduced.
