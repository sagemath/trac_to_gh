"Acknowledge", well... ;-)

Note that fat builds now do not even work on true 32-bit (x86) CPUs.  (That is, they don't and cannot *compile* either.)

Although there's no specific 32-bit code for the added (64-bit) CPUs, it's not sufficient to just add "dummy" macro definitions for those to `mpn/x86/fat/fat.c`.  (Not sure yet, but probably `configure[.ac]` needs to get fixed / updated accordingly as well.)

Works for me (i.e., builds and passes `make check`) on x86 as well as x86_64 with `ABI=32`.

Feel free to create an "updated spkg" / Sage patch from that (presumably by simply adding the patch to the spkg "metadata") -- I won't soon.

Just for the record:

With assertions enabled (MPIR configured with `--enable-assert`), I'm getting an *MPIR* test suite failure in 32-bit fat mode (`ABI=32` and `--enable-fat` on a 64-bit machine), which doesn't show up in non-fat 32-bit mode nor 64-bit fat mode:


```
FAIL: t-gcd (exit: 134)
=======================

divexact.c:107: GNU MP assertion failed: (np[0]) != 0
```


Haven't tracked this down yet, but apparently there's more to do upstream, not necessarily really related to the issue here...

The same happens on a true 32-bit machine, and also **without** `--enable-fat`, so the failure seems rather unrelated to the issue (and the patch) here.
