Keywords: lrs volume long numbers

The following (minimal) example does not work:

```
sage: prec = 24
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[10^prec,0], [0,10^prec], [-10^prec,0], [0,-10^prec]]).lrs_volume(verbose=True)
V-representation
begin
 4 3 rational
 1 1000000000000000000000000 0
 1 0 1000000000000000000000000
 1 -1000000000000000000000000 0
 1 0 -1000000000000000000000000
end
volume

ValueError: lrs did not return a volume
```

It seems, that the lines cannot be longer than 100 characters and that that is somewhere hard-coded. It would be good if that can be changed somewhere.

This seems to be fixed with the version of lrs installed in current Sage.


```
sage: prec = 24
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[10^prec,0], [0,10^prec], [-10^prec,0], [0,-10^prec]])
sage: P.volume(engine='lrs')
2e+48
```

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
