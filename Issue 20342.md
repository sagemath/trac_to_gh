Keywords: is_similar, Jordan normal form, similar

There are two more easy cases that we can check in is_similar before computing the Jordan form. 

1) If A==B, then A.is_similar(B) should return True and the identity map.
2) If A.charpoly() == B.charpoly() and A.charpoly() is square-free then A.is_similar(B) should return True.
