Keywords: finite_state_machine

At the moment, there is a `NotImplementedError` if `FiniteStateMachine._composition_explorative_` is used with a transducer with non-empty final word out.

This will be changed by using `FiniteStateMachine.process` when #16538 is fixed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16548
