# Issue 16311: FiniteStateMachine: implement final_word_out in _composition_explorative_

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16548

Original creator: skropf

Original creation time: 2014-06-26 06:28:53

CC:  dkrenn cheuberg

Keywords: finite_state_machine

At the moment, there is a `NotImplementedError` if `FiniteStateMachine._composition_explorative_` is used with a transducer with non-empty final word out.

This will be changed by using `FiniteStateMachine.process` when #16538 is fixed.

Made some minor rewritings. Please cross-review and set to positive when satisfied.

Everything looks good, tests pass, doc looks ok, code should be fine; merges on 6.5.rc0.
