Oh, I see.  Yet another not-well-advertised change, and of course with no Trac # in the git log.  Guess I haven't `bdist`ed in a while.

And indeed `SAGE_VERSION` is gotten from elsewhere now.  But NO CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENTATION and even http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html?highlight=bdist still has the old syntax.  **Not acceptable.**
