Just casting this BipartiteGraph to a graph is sufficient.

See [comment:ticket:9925:20 comment 20ff] at #9925 for a flaky doctest that #9422 and #10067 should fix.

I've opened #10081 for this failure.

Replying to [comment:1 ncohen]:

This patch looks pretty weird. It essentially says that
methods is_even_hole_free() and is_forest() cannot be applied to an instance of BipartiteGraph.
Why is that?
Isn't BipartiteGraph inheriting from Graph?

IMHO it looks like you cure a symptom rather than the root of the problem.

You're right. I gave you my best attempt at a reply in #10081.
