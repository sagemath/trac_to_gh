Currently, one can't inherit from a lazy imported class::


```
sage: class sage_X: pass
sage: sage.X = sage_X
sage: lazy_import("sage", "X")
sage: type(X)
<type 'sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport'>
sage: class Y(X): pass
....: 
sage: Y
------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
File "lazy_import.pyx", line 213, in sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport.__repr__ (sage/misc/lazy_import.c:1492)
File "lazy_import.pyx", line 110, in sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport._get_object (sage/misc/lazy_import.c:1011)
ImportError: No module named Y
```


As such, this feature is not necessarily that useful, but I had a
concrete use case where X was imported from a module which in turn
lazy imported from somewhere else (to provide a backward compatibility
link).
