# Issue 17446: Subgraph of Hasse Diagram gives error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17683

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2015-01-28 11:18:45

CC:  ncohen


```
sage: Poset({0:[1]})._hasse_diagram.subgraph([0])
NotImplementedError: An immutable graph does not change name
```


This same error has already been corrected from several other places.

(This will be needed for #17173, I guess.)
