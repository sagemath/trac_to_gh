I have wrote a simple program for addition and multiplication in Sage  using mpfi . same thing when I runs in Perl it took much lesser time

Hi Paul,

Akhilesh is sitting next to me here at Sage Days 75. Would you have any insight about the speed difference between Sage and Perl here?

Amitiés,
                                Nicolas
