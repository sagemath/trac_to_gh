# Issue 5039: Create a class for SetPartition (with no s)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/5039

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2009-01-20 20:17:01

Assignee: mhansen

CC:  sage-combinat

The Elements of `SetPartitions` of a set A are actually Sets of Sets. But there are specific functionalities I would like for those "Sets of Sets". For example : merge the classes of a an b and ask what is the representant of a, where a, b are in A.

Right now, Arnaud Bergeron and I coded and named it as `DisjointSet` and it is available in the sage-combinat tree. The implementation is inspired from :

This was integrated into sage in #6775, but I've reorganized the docs for `DisjointSet` to make the interactive documentation more informative.

Helloooooooooo !!

Several remarks :
* Could you update the ticket's title and description ?
* Why did you move the description of the data structure from the module to the function ? `:-/` I prefer when it is at the top of the html documentation, and here you have no idea of what is happening in that module... Plus there is a function and three classes in that module, so something should be said at the module level `:-/`
* I know it's not the point of this ticket but what would you think of changing `cardinality()` so that it actually returns the cardinality of the partition, and not the cardinality of its union ? And have another method named "`number_of_elements`" which would return what `cardinality` currently returns ? Would make more sense, wouldn't it ? It does not have to be in this ticket, though.

Nice patch though ! Always good to improve the doc `:-)`

Done

The main reason is for viewing the interactive doc using `DisjoinSet?` since getting the module level doc interactively is unintuitive IMO. I have I've added somethings to the module level directing you to the function for more info.

Part of me says yes, part no. However because this is how it's been, I don't want to make any changes. If you feel strongly about it, you can make the change on another ticket.

Thank you. Ready for review again.

Hmmmmm.. Well, I have the opposite view. With time I add more and more stuff at module level because I use Sage's documentation through Google, and it's hard to find the documentation when it's lost among dozens of functions :-)

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/graphs/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/vertex_separation.html

But well, for as long as we fight by adding doc in Sage this fight is a good fight `:-P`

Got it !

Thanks Travis for closing this ticket and Nathann for the review.

Having doc in the top of the module (for web doc browsing) vs in the the class (for ?  interactive doc browsing) is a good question. One answer could be to copy the same information in both place... At least now, there is a link at the top of the module linking to the class...

Yup.

Nah, don't duplicate. Better one good piece of documentation than two
things that will diverge.

I aim to put class-specific documentation in the class (so that it can
be accessed by introspection on the class; that's often how the user
will get to that). And when there is more than one class, to put an
overview/tutorial in the module. With cross links.

Cheers,
