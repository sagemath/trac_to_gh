All tests passed on my machine.

Not yet "needs review" for I want to dig once more in to check a detail I did not quite fully understand yet in the failure.

Okay, I think I understand why this change is needed. Did you manage to track down the detail you mentioned in comment:3?

My analysis was actually incorrect. The culprit really was in the categories, not the infrastructure, and is fixed now. The infrastructure just made it easy to screw up and hard to track. This later point should be fixed with #22962.

All long tests pass.

I'll now rebase #18700 on top of this one.

Somehow this change and why it wasn't working seems like something we should have realized sooner. I don't think this check is done elsewhere. Positive review.

Thanks for the review!

I had done a quick search for other `extra_super_categories` where similar checks, and indeed did not find any.
