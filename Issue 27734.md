The Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/misc/sageinspect.py` and `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` all arise because of the second line here (from `sageinspect.py`):

```
        spec = sage_getargspec(obj)
        s = str(inspect.formatargspec(*spec))
```

The problem is that `inspect.formatargspec` is deprecated in Python 3.5, so it prints warning messages. From Sage's point of view, this is annoying, because there is no direct replacement (as far as I can tell) for `inspect.formatargspec`. The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.formatargspec) says to use `signature` and `Signature`, but we have already obtained the signature information using `sage_getargspec` and just want to format it. Also, `inspect.signature` doesn't seem to work on Cython functions.

#27578 is related, by the way.

One short-term option is to silence the warnings. Another option is to just reimplement the `formatargspec` function: it's  about 15 lines long, just string manipulation.

As sage has it's own `getargspec` i think reimplementing `formatargspec` may be the best solution for now. That way sage would not be affected when `inspect.formatargspec` will be removed.

Note: `sage_getargspec` use `inspect.ArgSpec` and i wonder if this class will  be removed along with `inspect.formatargspec` and `inspect.getargspec`. 

Maybe we should define our own `ArgSpec` too.

I don't see anything indicating that `ArgSpec` will be removed. In `inspect.py`, it is defined by a one-liner:

```
ArgSpec = namedtuple('ArgSpec', 'args varargs keywords defaults')
```

(well, two lines if you count `from collections import namedtuple`). So it's trivial for us to implement if we need to.

Or we could switch to using `FullArgSpec`, defined in `inspect.py` by

```
FullArgSpec = namedtuple('FullArgSpec',

```

I don't think there is any urgency for either of these.
