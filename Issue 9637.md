It is not critical, but since its the only package not so show such a dependency, it would be nice to add it. The dependency is implied however.

If #9681 is merged, which I think it must be, then this can be closed as fixed.

This change is now incorporated in #9761, which already has positive review, *so this ticket can be closed as duplicate*.

Mitesh, that's your job... ;-)

I'm changing the status to "positive review," so that the release manager will see it at report {11} or {32} and close this ticket as a "duplicate" after #9761 gets merged.
