To match with the other functions in `sage-dist-helpers`, `sdh_pip_editable_install` should do its own error handling

Of course using `--enable-editable` now means that no `sage_conf` wheel is built any more! Which breaks tests such as `./sage -sh -c '(cd pkgs/sagemath-standard && tox -v -v -v -e python-sagewheels-nopypi)'`.
