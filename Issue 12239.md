the precompiled binary http://www.sagemath.org/mirror/linux/64bit/meta/sage-4.8-linux-64bit-ubuntu_10.04.3_lts-x86_64-Linux.tar.lzma.metalink fails some doctests on a 64-bit Core 2 under Ubuntu 10.10:

```
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py # 4 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modsym/space.py # 1 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph.py # 6 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/graphs/graph_list.py # 4 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modsym/subspace.py # 4 doctests failed
sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/modular/hecke/module.py # 2 doctests failed

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segmentation fault

         [8.7 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following tests failed:


        sage -t  "devel/sage-main/sage/modular/modsym/boundary.py"
Total time for all tests: 8.7 seconds
```

If this is not the right place to report such problems, please tell me.

with Sage 4.8 compiled from source only one doctest fails:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t  devel/sage-main/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py # Time out
```

I propose to close that ticket, since it only concerns an old version of Sage.
