Ok. I will rebase when next release is out.

This is a very weak motivation. Please elaborate why you think that this is needed...

I would prefer to require that variable names should be strings and nothing else. Of course, in Python 3, string == unicode so you get unicode support "for free" in Python 3.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
