# Issue 30898: Missing dependency for numpy

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31135

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2020-12-29 21:56:12

On OS X and an Ubuntu virtual machine, running

```
% make distclean
% ./configure
% make numpy
```

leads to an error:

```
Package 'numpy' is currently not installed
Uninstalling 'numpy' with legacy uninstaller
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.3.beta4/local/var/tmp/sage/build/numpy-1.19.4/src/../lapack_conf.py", line 7, in <module>
    pc_blas   = pkgconfig.parse('cblas blas')
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.3.beta4/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pkgconfig/pkgconfig.py", line 248, in parse
    _raise_if_not_exists(package)
  File "/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.3.beta4/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pkgconfig/pkgconfig.py", line 103, in _raise_if_not_exists
    raise PackageNotFoundError(package)
pkgconfig.pkgconfig.PackageNotFoundError: cblas not found
```

I am guessing that an entry is missing in `build/pkgs/numpy/dependencies`.
