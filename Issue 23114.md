Original creation time: 2017-07-02 08:37:22

With sage-8.0.rc0 and cryptominisat installed since #22818, on Ubuntu 16.04 with 8 cpus, make ptestlong gives:


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 61.4 src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py", line 89, in sage.sat.boolean_polynomials.solve
Failed example:
    s = solve_sat(F, s_verbosity=1, c_max_vars_sparse=4, c_cutting_number=8) # optional - cryptominisat
Expected:
    c --> ...
    ...
Got:
    c [consolidate] T: 0.00
    c Found matrixes: 0 T: 0.00 T-out: N
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  22 in sage.sat.boolean_polynomials.solve
    [27 tests, 1 failure, 0.72 s]
```


I get All tests passed when run separately.
