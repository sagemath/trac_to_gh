# Issue 23607: GapElement.__contains__ (from libgap) should use the infix `in` from gap

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23844

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2017-09-13 06:11:58

Right now `__contains__` is just inherited from `Element` which does some very wrong stuff when both sides are `GapElement`.

LGTM (although `Element` does not define a `__contains__`, so I updated the description).
