The absolute order is defined analogously to the weak order, but using all reflections rather than just the simple reflections.

Replying to [comment:6 chapoton]:

Yes... should we wait for that patch to get written and then rewrite this to work on coxeter groups in general, or just submit this as it is?

I think Kevin worked on this at Sage days 49, but IDK who the user "sam" is (if you're reading this, please add in your real name).

I agree that we should review this. I've moved stuff into the `CoxeterGroups` category, which is where the comments suggested they belong, and I added the methods to make it all work.

Why does this remove almost completely the file root_system/weyl_group.py ?

This seems wrong. Travis, do you understand why ?

There was something wrong a while ago with the trac plugin and I believe it just didn't update itself since. Anyways, once I had pulled and merged with my development branch, everything was good (as trac now reflects).

There are some infinite recursions in cmp that are probably caused by this ticket. Run the doctests, kids ;)

Changing status from positive_review to needs_work.

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-04-01 13:42:34

Ok, the doctest failures were due to #15978 and not this ticket. Never mind.

But who is "sam", is that really his full name? Lower case and all?


---

Comment by sam created at 2014-04-01 13:45:40

Sam Clearman.  I put my full name in the preferences but I guess that doesn't do anything?

No, you have to fill it in the Author field yourself.

Resolution: fixed

One should have used `.rank()` instead of `.image().dimension()`, for speed. This will be for another ticket.
