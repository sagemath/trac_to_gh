While computing the factors appearing in the BSD (Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer) conjectural formula for elliptic curves I came across some normalizations which could be made more consistently.

1. If e is a complex (non-real) embedding of a number field K and E is an elliptic curve over K then currently E.period_lattice(e).omega() returns the area/covolume of the period lattice, but in the BSD formula it needs to be doubled.  I propose leaving the default as is but adding a parameter which just doubles the returned value.  (For real embeddings, omega() already doubles the real period when there are two real components, and there is a case for doubling by default in the complex case but that would be backwards-incompatible.)
2. E.tamagawa_product_bsd() gives the product of E's Tamagawa numbers times a correction factor, needed in BSD, to allow for primes where the current model of E is not minimal.  We should also have E.tamagawa_product() for the product without the correction factor; currently this exists only for elliptic curves over Q.  The correction factor has nothing to do with Tamagawa numbers anyway.
3. If P is a point on E(K) then P.height() by default normalizes so that it is independent of base-change, and there is an option (normalize=False) not to do that. (Normalization just divides by the degree of K.)  But E.regulator_of_points() does not have that option.  It should: it is the non-normalized regulatro which appear in the BSD formula.

The three commits address the three points in the ticket description, one each.  Doctests have been added.  In the last case, the extra parameter was also added to the method `height_pairing_matrix()` which computes the relevant heights and is called by the regulator method.  In all cases where a parameter has been added, it is optional, and the behaviour with the default value is as it used to be.

I think you should add a description of what `normalised` means in the documentation for the INPUT block of `height_pairing_matrix()`. You have already included an example later in the documentation for `height_pairing_matrix()`, but missed describing it earlier.

The rest looks good to me.
