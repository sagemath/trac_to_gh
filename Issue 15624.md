# Issue 15624: dev.checkout ignores base argument with locally existing tickets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15861

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-25 10:08:57

`sage: dev.checkout(ticket='15714',base='develop')` will just switch to my local ticket/15714 instead of basing it on develop, as is suggested and actually the case if the ticket is not local.
