# Issue 13596: sign error in Steenrod algebra multiplication

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: Steenrod algebra

There is a sign error in the Steenrod multiplication routine at odd primes: with

  {{{
    A=SteenrodAlgebra(3) 
    Q=A.Q_exp
    P=A.P 
    print (Q(0,1)*P(3))*Q(1,1) 
    print Q(0,1)*(P(3)*Q(1,1))
  }}}

one gets

  {{{
    Q_0 Q_1 Q_2 
    2 Q_0 Q_1 Q_2
  }}}

Only the 2nd answer is correct.

Hi Christian, welcome aboard. The patch looks very good, except for a very minor detail: the example in the doctest should be indented one more space. Fix that, and I'll give it a positive review. By the way, if you want, you can add your name to the list of account names [on the wiki](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki).

Hi John, the indentation is now fixed. Hope I'll have something less trivial to contribute some day ;-)

I couldn't get your patch to apply, so I made a new one. Mercurial queues are a good way to deal with this sort of situation, in my experience.
