You renamed `sage.quadratic_forms.quadratic_form__local_representation_conditions` to `sage.quadratic_forms.local_representation`.

There are many `sage.quadratic_forms.quadratic_form__xxx` modules in the same package. Hence your change make only one of those modules out of the naming pattern. 

Why only one module? Do you plan to change the name of other modules too?

If you plan to change them all, how about the pattern `sage.quadratic_forms._local_representation_conditions`? 

And I think we should keep the original name `local_representation_conditions` as the original author intended.

I changed only one filename to avoid controversy.

My first choice for the shorter name was indeed `local_representation_conditions` but objected in comment:2 so I picked a shorter one.

There are also many files in the folder that already do not follow the pattern `quadratic_form__xxx` so I am not breaking the pattern.

I understood. But dropping a word has danger of changing the meaning. So instead of dropping a part, I suggested to add the prefix `_`. Then this pattern may be applied to other similar files later...

Sorry, using the prefix `_` for a module name does not look like a good idea.

Let's try to choose another name, that would suit everybody..

Maybe `local_representation_criteria` ?

`qf__local_representation_conditions`

?

My 2 cents.

I agree with Matthias in comment:15; we should rename all of them on one (separate) ticket.

I am +1 on removing `quadratic_form__` from all of the filenames as they are redundant with the folder name.

I am not so worried about comment:2; we have ways of resolving such conflicts with, e.g., `import foo as bar`. Yet, it would be good to avoid that for us humans who get confused.
