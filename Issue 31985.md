Looks good but I'm not sure if the `verbosity`/`verbose` renaming can be done without deprecation

I'm not sure It's the best way to add a deprecation warning, but this way we can use both.

Right, it's simpler like that.

I remove parameter `solver_verbose` that I introduced earlier because I think it's not useful to add yet another parameter about verbosity.
