In sage 8.3.beta7, plotting certain graphs results in a unicode decode error.


```
sage: A = graphs.AfricaMap()
sage: A.plot()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
```


The same happens with `A.show()`.

Thanks! And just to confirm, this was the only map among the following with such problems:

```
sage: A = graphs.AfricaMap()
sage: E = graphs.EuropeMap()
sage: U = graphs.USAMap()
sage: W = graphs.WorldMap()
```

and that's all the maps we currently have in `src/sage/graphs/generators/world_map.py`.
