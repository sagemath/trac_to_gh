# Issue 32793: Add more-itertools as a standard package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33030

Original creator: slelievre

Original creation time: 2021-12-15 23:33:41

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: spkg, more-itertools

The more-itertools Python package extends the itertools
module with a wealth of useful iteration tools such as
`pairwise`, `triplewise`, `unique_justseen`, etc.

Making it a standard package would allow writing many
algorithms more elegantly and naturally.
