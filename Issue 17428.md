CC:  @nathanncohen

This patch changes the data structure `binary_matrix_t` to use one bitset per row. This enables us to use directly operations on bitsets without casts.
Currently, this data structure is only used for operations on graphs.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17665

Hello,

You could also consider moving it to `sage/data_structures/`... no?

I have compilation errors that I don't know how to fix.

It also remains to move the data structure to appropriate directory.

Hello !

I added a small commit at `public/17665` that only fixes some doc and a function call. It is not equivalent to do the following change:


```diff
-    binary_matrix_set0(m,row,col)
-    m.rows[row][col >> index_shift] |= (<unsigned long>1) << (value & offset_mask)
+    if value:
+        binary_matrix_set1(m,row,col)
+    else:
+        binary_matrix_set0(m,row,col)
```


The purpose of the first code (and of `bitset_set_to` is specifically to avoid that 'if').

Nothing else to mention, and only my commit now needs a review!

Why did you replace

for i in range(m.n_rows):
```

by

```
for i from 0 <= i < m.n_rows:
```

everywhere? The latter is considered legacy syntax.

Also: make sure your types match. `n_rows` and `n_cols` are declared as `long`, then loop indices should also be `long` (you use `int` in many places).

I thought it was better this way, but if it's not the correct cython syntax, we can go back to `range(n)`.

It was already `int`in many places. So we can try to unify the stuff.
Honestly I doubt that we really need `long` for `n_rows` and `n_cols`. `int` should be large enough, no?


Why have you changed the path to the branch? I cannot write to u/jdemeyer/ticket/17665  and I'm unable to see what Nathann's pushed.

It's technically correct but not recommended.

I would personally use `long` (or even better: `Py_ssize_t`). There is no reason to artificially restrict to 2^32 rows and columns. Even if you don't see an obvious use-case for this, perhaps other people do.

Given that

```
sage: Matrix(GF(2), 2^32, 1)
4294967296 x 1 dense matrix over Finite Field of size 2 (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

works fine, the same would work for this `binary_matrix` class.

I have implemented requested changes:
- use `range(n)` instead of `for i from 0 <= i < n`
- use type `Py_ssize_t` instead of `int` or `long` in `binary_matrix`

Let me know if further changes are needed.

Given that bitsets are initialized with zeros, replace

```
binary_matrix_init(m, n, n)
binary_matrix_fill(m, 0)
```

by

```
binary_matrix_init(m, n, n)
```


In `bitset_are_disjoint`, replace

```
We assume ``a.limbs == b.limbs``.
```

by

```
We assume ``a.limbs <= b.limbs``.
