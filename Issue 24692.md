`R.zero()` and `R.one()` should always work for rings.

Replying to [comment:5 vdelecroix]:
> `R.zero()` and `R.one()` should always work for rings.

And `R(0)` and `R(1)` should always work without conditions.

You are breaking the pep8 formatting of the header. Please do not do that.

I am guessing you want `R(0)` and `R(1)` in case `R` is something like `int` so we don't have to special case it. Could you add a comment saying this as otherwise someone (who could very well be me) might go to `R.zero()`/`R.one()` as it is faster (avoids going through the coercion framework) and cached.

LGTM. Any other comments or objections to setting a positive review?

Would be good to check more output types. For example in

```
sage: q_binomial(3r, 2r, 1r)
3
```
