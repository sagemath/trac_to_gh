Or maybe it's not supposed to then, since it's not being shown... in which case why not just put this in the `matplotlib` definition, which currently has `legend_options={`}?

Whoever wrote the legend code probably didn't want unnecessary initializations. I kept it the same, that is the `legend_opts` don't get populated unless it is absolutely required. Otherwise we could just initialize it in `__init__` instead of passing ``@`options` or ``@`suboptions` all over the place.

If `show_legend` is None, then of course, nothing happens. If it is set to True, then something weird can happen. I will check this case.

Ok. This is a much better fix since it takes care of all cases, for example if you pass an incomplete set of options in the `legend={}` argument, set `show_legend=True`, etc.
