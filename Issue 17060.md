Looks good and passes tests.

When `FiniteField_ext_pari` will be removed in the future, maybe we can write a function that unpickles old `FiniteField_ext_pari` pickles as `FiniteField_pari_ffelt` fields (and similarly for elements)?

Yes, we should certainly try that (after the deprecation period is over).

Volker, can this still be merged in Sage version 6.4? The earlier that users know about this deprecation, the better. Thanks!
