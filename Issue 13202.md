Currently, `ZZ.ideal(3)` will call `ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(3)` (and get back `False` of course) to see if the argument is a ring that might be able to generate an ideal in `R`. This is a problem, because `has_coerce_map_from` caches its result and 3 is not weakreffable. That means a strong reference to 3 is stored on ZZ, preventing it from ever being deleted. These things pile up and contaminate the cache. A classic example of **DON'T DO THAT**. The solution is to first test if the argument is appropriate to be fed into `has_coerce_map_from`.

An alternative is to delete the test completely! I'm no sure the relevant branch ever does something useful.

This issue came up in handling another ticket. See
[#715, comment 198](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/715#comment:198).

Even if #12969 fixes the resulting leak (I am not sure if it does, perhaps not), I believe that your patch has the potential to fix an independent problem:

```

AttributeError: type object 'int' has no attribute 'gens'
```
That is because

```
sage: ZZ.has_coerce_map_from(int)
True
```
but

```
sage: int in Rings()
False
```

With your patch, the error would be

```
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'type'> to an integer
```
I think it would be a good idea to catch the type error internally and raise a type error with a more meaningful error message stating which arguments are accepted by ideal().

Since the patchbot gives a green light (or green blob), I tend to give it a positive review, but would like to add a referee patch.

Absolutely, go ahead. And please address the other instances of this type of test in #11068 as well (just grep for `has_coerce_map_from` in the patch there). Perhaps we should add some documentation to `has_coerce_map_from` as well, warning against frivolous feeding of the cache. This is a general issue: People should be a bit more careful calling caching functions. Things like

```
# should be quick, because this should easily fit in the L2 CPU cache.
for i in srange(10^9):
   if is_square(caching_function(i)):
      print "Wow, I did not expect to find a square value for that thing; i=",i
      break
```
don't go so well. Memory leaks also hurt performance, due to OS overhead and non-locality of working set.

And what do you think about the alternative of simply deleting the lines:

```
    elif self.has_coerce_map_from(first): 
        gens = first.gens() # we have a ring as argument
```
when I tried it didn't break any doctests...

I think there is a better (i.e., more conceptual) solution: `R.coerce_map_from(S)` should first test whether S is a parent or a type.

The same, by the way, should hold for convert_map_from.

That indicates we should *add* a doctest demonstrating the use of `R.ideal(S)` where `S` is a ring that coerces into `R`. Because that is what the lines you're citing implement.

What does that mean for the patch here? `self.has_coerce_map_from(first)` is meant as some kind of duck typing for rings. But it fails, as we can see with `ZZ.ideal(int)`. Hence, your idea to test `first in Rings()` makes sense, independent of the memory leak problem.

So, I think we should keep this ticket, and I will create a patch for coerce_map_from on a different ticket.

I still doubt the validity of the test at all. Is the existence of a coercion map a good way of checking whether it's safe to call `gens()` on the object?

If I'm not mistaken, this test is part of a loop in `Ring.ideal` to flatten and convert its arguments into a finite list of elements that supposedly can be used to generate the ideal asked for. The coercion (or its failure) will happen once the ideal gets constructed. In this part, we only need to establish whether it's reasonable to expect that the ideal generated by `S` is the same as that generated by `S.gens()`. So shouldn't it be

```
    if first in AdditiveMagmasWithGens():
        gens= first.gens()
```
or something like that? Of course, this doesn't rule out that calling `gens` might be very expensive if it actually needs to compute generators:

```
R=Zmod(next_prime(10^100)*next_prime(10^102))
exp=exponentiationpairing(R.multiplicative_group(),ZZ)
K=exp.right_kernel() #place holder object with fast non-member detection
ZZ.ideal(K)
```
but hey, that code doesn't exist anyway and we can't protect the user against everything.

If our `AdditiveMagma` is actually `VectorSpace(RR,17)` we'll get an error because the elements of `gens` cannot be coerced into the ring to generate an ideal there (or they can!).

No!

In fact, there is a coerce map from the type int to any ring, but the type int of course has no gens().

Correct.

I am still not sure. Perhaps we should really ask ourselves what is really needed in the code.

We need that "first" has a gens() method, which returns a list of elements, and we need that the elements coerce (not just convert) into self. It is actually not needed that "first" is a ring or an additive magma, and being a ring does not necessary mean that "gens" exists.

So, what you think about the following approach:

* If "first" is an element, not a parent, then the non-existence of a coercion from first to self should not be cached (because the non-existence is clear). I think the fix should be in Parent.coerce_map_from(), not in Ring.ideal(). Hence, leave that to #13378.
* We need to duck-type the gens method of first. Of course, we can not ensure that it will give the answer quickly, and you are right that we can't protect the user from it.
* We need that "first" coerces into self.

Hence, the code should be like this:

```python
if hasattr(first,"gens"):
    if self.has_coerce_map_from(first): # which should not cache too eagerly
        first = [self(x) for x in self.gens()]
if isinstance(first, (list,tuple,Sequence, <you name it>)):
    <some code that creates an ideal>
```

What do you think of that?

I think that, without a concrete use case where it's obvious people would
actually be stuffing this kind of object into Ring.ideal (possibly indirectly),
I would just not support it at all. Anybody sane would be extremely sceptical
about letting a computer algebra system make deductions for them if that can be
reasonably avoided. If I were to explicitly construct an ideal from `S.gens()`, I would do

```
ZZ.ideal( ZZ(g) for g in S.gens() )
```
rather than

```
R.ideal(S)
```
Funnily enough, the former currently fails with

```
TypeError: unable to coerce <type 'generator'> to an integer
```
I don't think this branch is hit by the quite believable

```
sage: ZZ['x']*ZZ.ideal(3)
Principal ideal (3) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```
In my experience, you can put a lot of work into being extremely liberal in
accepting input in all kinds of forms, only to find that people only use the
most basic case anyway.

Did you test whether stuff still works?

I tried to remove the support for "R.ideal(S)" with a ring S. The patch:

I get this doctest error:

```

**********************************************************************
File "/mnt/local/king/SAGE/prereleases/sage-5.3.beta2/devel/sage-main/sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py", line 482:

Got:
    False
```

So, the question is whether we can get this coerce map *without* support for "R.ideal(S)", S a ring.
