The ipython notebook is really simple and ergonomic. 

To me the only problem is if we want plot something or show something like in the sage notebook... That is not easy... and I did find a deterministic way to plot what I want easily.

For example, if I want plot a tree, I can do that

```
from IPython.display import Image, display
file = "/blabla/myfiles/foo/img.png"
b = BinaryTree([[[],[]],[]])
latex.eval(latex(b), locals(), filename=file)
display(Image(filename=file))
```


Ok, that is really not sexy but that's work.

One problem is:

```
f = x^2 + x + 3
latex.eval(latex(b), locals(), filename=file)
display(Image(filename=file))
```

doesn't work!

One has to append `$`:

```
latex.eval("$" + latex(f) + "$", locals(), filename=file)
```

and ok...

So my questions are:

- what is the good way to do that? (especially, I would like to (re)use the sage notebook technology)
- Is it possible to add this feature in the ipython patch? I means something like :

```
class SageObject:
    ...

    def _repr_png_(self):
         return do_something_to_compute_img_of_self(self)
```

(Like in that tutorial: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/1.x/examples/notebooks/Custom%20Display%20Logic.ipynb)

- and obviously, how to lunch automatically the ipython notebook with the magic command `%load_ext sage`?

Thanks!

Hi,

you can be interested by [this wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook). Also, i went to ipython IRC a few days ago and it seems (at least from their point of view) the best way is indeed to propose a _repr_html_ (and similar) method. So i guess (without being completely sure) this should be advocated within the Sage community.

Hi Thierry,

Replying to [comment:1 tmonteil]:
> you can be interested by [this wiki page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/IpythonNotebook). 

Thanks you ! That is a good idea!

Replying to [comment:1 tmonteil]:

Why not... Just there is lot of tikz code (particulary mine) in sage, so I expect you don't forget all the latex code which can't be interpreted by mathjax.

Now, I would like code a(n ugly) hack to use (quickly) ipython notebook... if someone understands the bowels of the sage-notebook, I would be grateful to show me the way.

In a second time, this ticket could be used and merged in your long project.

Then to load sage lib ( `%load_ext sage` ), I create a ipy file in `.../.sage/ipython-x.xx/profile_**default**/startup/` with the content


```
%load_ext sage
sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True
```


And tada!!!

The file in `.sage/ipython-x.xx/profile_**default**/startup/` is a ipython file (`toto.ipy`)...

The complete file must be some thing like that ...

```

%load_ext sage
sage.misc.latex.EMBEDDED_MODE = True

from sage.misc.latex import latex
latex.add_package_to_preamble_if_available("tikz")
latex.add_to_mathjax_avoid_list("tikz")
```


(I don't know why but we need the 3 last lines... with my hack...)
