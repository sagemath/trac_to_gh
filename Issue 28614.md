# Issue 28614: Polar of integer polytopes does not respect backend

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28851

Keywords: polytopes, polar

Currently, polytopes over the integers have there own method for `polar`, which does not respect the current backend:

```
sage: polytopes.cube(backend='normaliz').polar().backend()
'ppl'
```

We change this by constructing a new polytope from the parent. Just like the overwritten method.
