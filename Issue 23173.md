Keywords: meataxe, performance

This is in order to split #23352 into smaller chunks.

MeatAxe has global variables FfCurrentRowSizeIo and FfNoc, that by construction always satisfy the equality `FfCurrentRowSizeIo==FfTrueRowSize(FfNoc)`, where FfTrueRowSize is some function.

At some point, when profiling computations involving MeatAxe, I found that the function `FfTrueRowSize` was called very often. Therefore I suggest to apply yet another patch to MeatAxe, that replaces `FfTrueRowSize(FfNoc)` by `FfCurrentRowSizeIo`.
