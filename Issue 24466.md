When compiling the GMP library, do not forget to enable the C++ interface:
add --enable-cxx to the configuration options.

> This also happens after backing out the ticket

I think it's a bug in the *previous* version of this ticket then.

> This is the second build of gcc

There shouldn't be a second build of gcc.

It would be very useful to see the auto-generated `build/make/Makefile` from the failed build to understand what is happening.
