# Issue 15320: Unify EMBEDDED_MODE

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15557

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-12-20 12:50:04

CC:  vbraun

Right now, `EMBEDDED_MODE` is defined in many places. This ticket will ensure that `EMBEDDED_MODE` is used only as `sage.plot.plot.EMBEDDED_MODE`. This remains compatible with sagenb.

Note also that Sage Cell changes it to a dictionary in `sage.misc.misc`:

It would be nice to coordinate further changes to prevent divergence. Or perhaps live things as is and instead become UI agnostic as Volker suggests in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16995#comment:3

With the new display system there should be no such things at all!
