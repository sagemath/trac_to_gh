I managed to play with the code a little. The problem seems to be in the _sage_src_lines_() method/function in src/sage/sets/set_from_iterator.py, which expects the 2nd and 17th line of the source code of order() to read certain things.

The addition of the "See also" line is moving things around and that is what is causing the doc test to fail. One can fix this by changing ` S[0][2]` to ` S[0][3]` and ` S[0][17]` to ` S[0][18]`, but I'm not experienced enough to know if that will break something else.

Sorry about that! I did not test all the files before I set it to positive review. 

The synopsis of the problem is that (as Arvind explains), to illustrate a certain feature, the failing doctest used `MathieuGroup.order`.

Do you know what `groups.misc.AdditiveCyclic(5).degree()` is supposed to mean ? Its docstring says "return 1". And the function ... returns 1.

I guess that is supposed to mean that each representation is of degree (=dimension) 1, since it is Abelian. Though that is not what I would call "degree of the group".
