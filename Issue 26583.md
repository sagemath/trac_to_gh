PEP8 cleaning in methods `eccentricity`, `radius`, `diameter`, `center`, `periphery`. On the way, we do:
- in `radius`, `center`, `periphery`: replace the long description of the list of algorithms by a forward to method `eccentricity`
- in `radius`, `diameter`, `center`, `periphery`: set parameter `v` when calling method `eccentricity` in order to avoid calls to `.vertices()`

Hi,\\

What is the goal of this ticket? Is it to enhance compatibility with pep8 or to be fully compatible with pep8?

In the second case i have the following remarks:
- 1. line 14069: `weight_function = lambda e: e[2]`. Do not assign a lambda expression use a def.\\
Pep8 quote:
>Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda \\
>expression directly to an identifier.
>
>Yes:
>
>def f(x): return 2*x
>
>No:
>
>f = lambda x: 2*x


- 2. lines 14122 and 14123: continuation line under-indented for visual indent

for example you can do this :

```

                length = self.shortest_path_lengths(u, by_weight=by_weight,
                                                    algorithm=algorithm,
                                                    weight_function=weight_function,
                                                    check_weight=check_weight)
```

instead of this :

```
                length = self.shortest_path_lengths(u, by_weight=by_weight,
                         algorithm=algorithm, weight_function=weight_function,
                         check_weight=check_weight)
```
