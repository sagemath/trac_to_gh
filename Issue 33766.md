This happens in maxima as well, so I think it's upstream:


```
(%i1) f: (1/9007199254740992*x + 137746446019/274877906944)^(3733441697325247/4503599627370496);
              x           137746446019 3733441697325247/4503599627370496
(%o1) (---------------- + ------------)
       9007199254740992   274877906944
(%i2) taylor(f,x,0,2);
Maxima encountered a Lisp error:

 Memory limit reached. Please jump to an outer pointer, quit program and enlarge the
memory limits before executing the program again.

Work-arounds also have problems:

```
sage: R.<t>=QQbar[[]]
sage: c=(1/9007199254740992*t + 137746446019/274877906944)+O(t^2)
sage: c^(3733441697325247/4503599627370496)
OverflowError: value too large to convert to int
```

(the problem is that taking an n-th root expects an "int" and the denominator of the exponent here is too large for that)
so I'm not so sure the example is a "simple" Taylor series expansion as claimed in the title :-). Or is this a technical term?

**Edit:** Regardless of whether it's simple or not, it's an entirely reasonable example. It does look like it may be escaping some assumptions that existing code may be making; possibly for efficiency or ease-of-implementation reasons. So there's a real possibility a fix needs a different implementation rather than a small bugfix.

this is an example which arises in my research. Computing by hand the Taylor expansion with `diff` works well.
