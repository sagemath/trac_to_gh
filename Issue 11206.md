The Developer's Guide, in the section "Doctesting the Sage Library", in the subsection "Beyond the Sage Library", has the following sentence: "The doctesting scripts of a Sage installation currently have limited support for doctesting of modules outside of *that* Sage library."

I believe it should read "outside of the Sage library".

Actually, I think it should probably say "outside of the Sage library for that version of Sage".

That does sound more clear.  I have update my patch to use your suggested wording.
