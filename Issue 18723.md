```
Test if a Paley graph is `(v,k,\lambda,\mu)`-strongly regular.
```

Huh? Do you mean 

```
Test whether a  `(v,k,\lambda,\mu)`-strongly regular graph is Paley.
```

wrong ticket, sorry, should have been #18948...

`It is said to be *projective* if any two of its codewords are linearly independent.`

This needs an extra care: a projective code, if defined this way, cannot contain the all-0 word. 

(Usually a projective code is defined as a subset of points in a projective space; your definition is OK, if you add that it does not contain an all-0 word).

Hmmmm... Too bad you did not review van Lint and Schrijver's paper, for this is a copy paste of definition 2 (page 2) of their paper `:-P`

well, it's behind a paywall for me (and Oxford - although we should have a paper copy)
Anyhow, your correction does not go far enough: namely, a projective code cannot have all-0 codeword, in all the (free) internet sources I can find.

Oh, I see - they belong to a school allowing all-0 vector while talking about linear
dependence. Then what you had before is OK. Well, almost OK, because a code consisting of just one word, all-0, would be projective by their definition, but it won't for any other definition.

Are you okay with the current state? I do not think that much confusion can happen anymore, in its current form.

No, check the definition! It is about linear independence of **coordinates**, not codewords. The definition, with details, is actually from Delsarte's [4], where you see what coordinates are; [4] is a free [download](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X72900246).
In a nutshell, take the matrix M with the **rows** consisting of the codewords of C (it suffices to take any generating subset set of codewords, if we talk about linear codes). Then the definition says that every two **columns** of M are linearly independent.

Equivalently, they add, the dual code C* of C has minimal distance 3: indeed, a linear dependence between two columns of M gives rise to a weight 2 word w in C*, and thus the minimal distance at most 2 (take the distance between all-0 word in C* and w).   

Sorry for the confusion; this is indeed about a set of points in a projective space, the space of columns of M---but not the set of codewords of C...

Could you please change [LintSchrijver81] to [vLintSchrijver81] to indicate that it's van Lint?

I'm a bit confused about how one is supposed to find `strongly_regular_from_two_weight_code` in Sage. It's not exported, and for some reason doesn't pop up in the documentation index...

Done. I don't know if that is the whole of your review, but it would be cool if you could review everything and give your comments afterwards. Otherwise I have to make individual commits for one-letter changes, and well...

It appears in the documentation of `strongly_regular_db` when I build it. If it does not appear on your computer then there is a problem. About your "how to find it": not all graph methods appear in the `Graph` class. Some, which I consider more 'confidential', have to be imported from the modules. Like several kind of weird vertex/edge colorings.
