This ticket adds several constructions of strongly regular graphs from two-weight codes.

The data used here has been provided by Eric Chen, using information available on his database of two-weight codes: http://moodle.tec.hkr.se/~chen/research/2-weight-codes/search.php

`It is said to be *projective* if any two of its codewords are linearly independent.`

This needs an extra care: a projective code, if defined this way, cannot contain the all-0 word. 

(Usually a projective code is defined as a subset of points in a projective space; your definition is OK, if you add that it does not contain an all-0 word).

well, it's behind a paywall for me (and Oxford - although we should have a paper copy)
Anyhow, your correction does not go far enough: namely, a projective code cannot have all-0 codeword, in all the (free) internet sources I can find.

Oh, I see - they belong to a school allowing all-0 vector while talking about linear
dependence. Then what you had before is OK. Well, almost OK, because a code consisting of just one word, all-0, would be projective by their definition, but it won't for any other definition.

No, check the definition! It is about linear independence of **coordinates**, not codewords. The definition, with details, is actually from Delsarte's [4], where you see what coordinates are; [4] is a free [download](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X72900246).

Equivalently, they add, the dual code C* of C has minimal distance 3: indeed, a linear dependence between two columns of M gives rise to a weight 2 word w in C*, and thus the minimal distance at most 2 (take the distance between all-0 word in C* and w).   

Sorry for the confusion; this is indeed about a set of points in a projective space, the space of columns of M---but not the set of codewords of C...
