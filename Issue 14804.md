REPORT:

* the first part of the patch just removes some whitespace from the general interact library, and as far as I can tell has nothing to do with this ticket.  I'm still for it though, and it looks fine to me.

* What's up with this in rule.py (all over in various places) -- it seems like the "useless try/except" -- please explain:

```
    try:
        trees = logicparser.get_trees(premise1, premise2)
    except SyntaxError:
        raise
```

 
* Everything else looks good to me.
