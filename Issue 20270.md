Since #20157 when I build Numpy, as well as anything else that uses `numpy.distutils` (namely SciPy) I get a lot of the warning:


```
atlas_blas_info:
Disabled atlas_blas_info: (ATLAS is None)
  libraries f77blas,cblas,atlas not found in []
  NOT AVAILABLE

/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/numpy-1.11.0/src/numpy/distutils/system_info.py:1584: UserWarning:
    Atlas (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/) libraries not found.
    Directories to search for the libraries can be specified in the
    numpy/distutils/site.cfg file (section [atlas]) or by setting
    the ATLAS environment variable.
```


This caused me deep confusion considering that my laptop just spent a long, hard night compiling ATLAS :)  Of course, what's actually going on is that Numpy is being configured to use whatever generic blas/lapack it has (which is correctly including `-latlas` in its linker flags).

Howver, the `spkg-install` for Numpy sets the environment variable `ATLAS=None` which forces Numpy's system_info to report that it doesn't have ATLAS.  Of course, it does, so AFAICT this is just a user interface issue albeit a confusing one.

Is there some way we could modify this so that when we do know what BLAS library we're using we at least let Numpy report it correctly?  It could figure this out at install time by checking the lapack.pc and/or blas.pc files.

I tried reading through #20157 but there's a lot of context missing that makes it hard to tease out what the issues really are.

So what do you mean by "feed your user configuration" in this case?  In #20157 you write "Since we want the choice of blas/lapack to be configurable by .pc files" but that could be better specified.  What do you mean by that exactly?  What if I don't want to edit a .pc file to change my BLAS or LAPACK libs and instead want to tell Numpy exactly what I'm using through the means it already provides?

What this should really be doing is setting all the `ATLAS,PTATLAS,OPENBLAS,MKL,BLISS,etc.` environment variables to 'None' *except* the one for th implementation I'm actually using.

For now I changed my `spkg-install` for Numpy to just search for `-latlas` in `blas.pc` and unset `ATLAS` if found.  This does the correct thing, but it's still a hack since relying on the `.pc` file alone is not a great way to determine what BLAS I'm actually using (except in this case there is a way, just ad-hoc).

If I set `ATLAS` to something more useful then it will look for something I'm feeding it.

So there's no reason for Numpy to report something inaccurate.

As I wrote in my previous comment if I know I'm using ATLAS and I unset the `ATLAS` environment variable then the issue is resolved.  What the `spkg-install` is doing currently removes context from the Numpy configuration unnecessarily.

OK the current default in `sage` is to build ATLAS but Volker and I have been in this conspiracy for at least a couple of year to make `sage` use any blas/lapack we like - mirroring a possibility already existing in sage-on-gentoo. 
We left a track of tickets, although there has been a few private emails as well, starting with bringing pkgconf in `sage` (although it had other side purpose) then its python interface. So we got the current ATLAS spkg install a .pc and probably also the optional openblas spkg and started to make use of .pc files all over the place.
numpy/scipy was the latest place not using the .pc file for blas/lapack and I made it behave, with a slightly lighter hand than what is done in pure Gentoo actually.

There has been the occasional email on sage-devel about using MKL and other alternatives blas/lapack but only few people have shown a big interest.

I think those are fine goals to have, and are not necessarily contradictory with what I'm proposing--in fact the opposite.  If there were a clearer way during a build of sage+dependencies to specify which BLAS implementation is being built with, it wouldn't be necessary to disable detection of that library in Numpy, Scipy, or anything else that uses `numpy.distutils`.

In other words, it would be good to configure Sage at build time what BLAS it's using in such a way that it can pass that on to other packages as well in case they do care, or just for the sake of provenance / reporting.

In the meantime this *can* be sort of done in the limited case of ATLAS, albeit in a somewhat fragile sense, by checking for `-latlas`.  If/when Sage improves support for other libraries that could be handled on a case-by-case basis.

Really? Then I am missing something, either in this ticket or in #17075...

Maybe I can try to be more specific.  Indeed there are two issues here.  The first is pretty far removed from this issue but not "orthogonal" either.

For example "blas-atlas.pc".  (It also makes good distinction between `Libs` and `Libs.private` in those files--for example `-latlas` is only needed in `Libs.private`).

I am familiar with debian alternatives and its equivalent implementation in gentoo. I am sure Jeroen is too. Like you say I am not sure we want to go the full way in sage.

A meta package is I guess a vehicle we all have in mind but no one has committed to writing that yet. Although the current spkg is partly a meta-package already.

When I wrote about `configure` I didn't think about choosing the "internal" blas/lapack but providing a system one if desired, but choosing an internal one should probably be covered there as well.

I'll note that numpy/scipy is an oddity in informing you of the blas/lapack used. Auto-detection by configure script  is difficult because of the variety of implementations. Most configure script just ask for the library you want to use and don't really care what they are, only that they work.

But to go back to your point, once you have gone to .pc files some information is held in `{blas,cblas,lapack}.pc` the content could be a bit more informative at least when set up by an internal spkg.

```
SAGE_ROOT=/Users/fbissey/build/sage-7.2.beta5
prefix=${SAGE_ROOT}/local
libdir=${prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include
Name: blas
Version: 1.0
Description: blas for sage, set up by the ATLAS spkg.
Libs: -L${libdir} -lblas
```

above the `blas.pc` on my mac. On mac we use Apple's accelerate framework (and it is set up by the atlas spkg, as I say that spkg already has meta bits). The description could reflect the fact that it is accelerate not just that it has been set by the atlas spkg.

I think it's overkill to allow side-by-side installation of different BLAS libraries within Sage. I agree that there should be a choice (just like we already have between MPIR and GMP or between Python2 and Python3) but there is no need to support two installations at the same time.

I have big doubts about this statement...

It's not sufficient to deal just with the BLAS libraries themselves, but also other packages (Python packages, other libraries) depending on BLAS...

If I spent some 24 hours waiting for ATLAS to build, and then I install OpenBLAS, it will clobber my ATLAS installation.  That alone is a good reason to allow side-by-side installation.
