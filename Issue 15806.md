For a field F and for a prime p, ( , )_p denotes the Hilbert Symbol over F localized at p.  It is well known that (a,b)_p*(a,c)_p=(a,bc)_p for any a, b in F (cf O'meara 63:12).  But I'm getting:


```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+5)
sage: p=K.primes_above(2)[0];p
Fractional ideal (2, a + 1)
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-1,p)
1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,2,p)
1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-2,p)
-1
```


Performing the same calculations using pari commands yields the same results -- unsurprising since hilbert_symbol just calls pari's nfhilbert():



```
sage: p
Fractional ideal (2, a + 1)
sage: q=p.pari_prime()
sage: pari(K).nfhilbert(2*a,-1,p.pari_prime())
1
sage: pari(K).nfhilbert(2*a,2,p.pari_prime())
1
sage: pari(K).nfhilbert(2*a,-2,p.pari_prime())
-1
```



So it looks like pari is introducing the bug.  Checking against Magma gives 1,-1,-1 respectively for the three Hilbert symbols, which is what you would expect to get.

By the basic properties of the Hilbert symbol, (2, -1)<sub>*p*</sub> = (2, 2)<sub>*p*</sub> = (2, -2)<sub>*p*</sub> = 1 for any *p*.  Hence if *p* is the unique prime dividing 2 in *K*, some other correct values are
* (*a*, 2)<sub>*p*</sub> = -1
* (*a*, -2)<sub>*p*</sub> = -1
* (*a*, -1)<sub>*p*</sub> = 1
PARI also computes (*a*, 2)<sub>*p*</sub> incorrectly.  In the latest version of PARI/GP (2.7.0, not yet in Sage), one has

```
gp > K=nfinit(x^2+5);
gp > p=idealfactor(K,2)[1,1];
gp > a=Mod(x,K.pol);
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,2,p)
%4 = 1  # should be -1
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,-2,p)
%5 = -1
gp > nfhilbert(K,a,-1,p)
%6 = 1
```

Have you reported the bug to the PARI developers?  (See `http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/Bugs/Reporting.html` for how to do this.)

I see.  That makes a lot of sense.  I wasn't sure if Sage only updated PARI at major releases or along the way.  In that case, maybe there is not such a great urgency to patch a fix into sage since we should see it reflected soon enough.  

Then just to be clear, should I change the current doctest to reflect the mathematically correct answer, i.e., 



```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+5)
sage: p=K.primes_above(2)[0];p
Fractional ideal (2, a + 1)
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-1,p)
1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,2,p)
-1
sage: K.hilbert_symbol(2*a,-2,p)
-1
```


So that doctests return errors only until the bug is fixed?  And after that point it will just be another nice correct example?  Thanks for the helpful comments!
