Starting with OSX 10.14, /usr/include is the latest victim in Apple's quest to store every file at a non-standard location. For now, the very intuitive (and irreversible)

```
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg 
```

barfs various missing files into the filesystem but this is only a bandaid and will no longer be provided in the future. 

XCode clang has the new header location compiled in, so most software should not notice. What seems to go wrong is bootstrapping compilers, and gfortran doesn't compile any more.

On #26286 I'm trying to see how feasible is to switch to building Sage under Homebrew. Obviously it's getting untenable to keep supporting OSX the way we do now.

I wouldn't want to rely on homebrew since it cannot be used without root (must install into /usr/local). 

IMHO a better choice is to rely on the conda toolchain https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/compiler-tools.html. Just make a private conda env in Sage if no suitable compiler can be found.

not being able to be root makes things too complicated, in particular on a platform where 99.9% of users it's a personal machine where they can either be root or at least tell the sysadmin to chown /usr/local to them.

Homebrew is very popular, so we'd have to support it. I guess the difference with conda is not big, and doing both won't be a big burden. One has to start somewhere...

You keep asserting this, but saying it many times does not make it true.
