# Issue 17063: Upgrade R to 3.1.2

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17300

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2014-11-06 10:14:50

Keywords: r-project

It's that time of the year again.

Reasons to upgrade remain the same : ability to communicate with R core developpers, without getting the "upgrade to current version" cold shoulder.

I checked the checksums from the original tarball, installed the package successfully, and was able to open a R session. Looks good to me.
