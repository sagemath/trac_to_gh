It seems `sage-location` does not properly fix GCC.  In particular, the output of `gcc -print-search-dirs` (which is used by `libtool` for example) is wrong after relocating Sage.

This can give problems in the following scenario:
1. install Sage from source, including Sage's GCC
2. relocate Sage
3. rebuild PPL
4. rebuild LinBox

The obvious solution is to rebuild GCC when needed.

Blocker because it breaks upgrading in certain cases.

I haven't been able to reproduce a problem by following the directions, but I can see that some paths are wrong in `local/lib64/*.la` files, and they're fixed after upgrading from a version of Sage which includes this patch. For `libgfortran.la`, the path for `dependency_libs` is still wrong, but all of the `libdir` paths are okay. Does the wrong path for `dependency_libs` actually matter?

Which exact version of Sage did you try?

> Does the wrong path for `dependency_libs` actually matter?
Not sure.  The main point is that this patch makes upgrading work.

I built Sage 5.3 from scratch, moved the build directory, did `./sage -f spkg/standard/ppl-...` and `./sage -f spkg/standard/linbox-...`. No obvious errors. I also tried doing `./sage -upgrade ...`, upgrading from 5.4-rc4. This was all on sage.math.

I'm not sure about that. When you upgrade, the old sage-location script is run so sage-current-location.txt is changed but a few paths aren't, so how can those old paths ever be fixed?

`sage-location` doesn't specifically change `dependency_libs`, it changes the `.la` file as a whole.
