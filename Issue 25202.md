# Issue 25202: Incorrect residue discs and coleman integration in hyperelliptic curves over p-adics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2018-05-24 19:10:54

#14825 changed p-adic expansions, and made incorrect fixes to various pieces of code in hyperelliptic curves.  The problem results from the two different means of indexing the expansion: one starting from `p^0` and the other from `p^v` where `v` is the valuation.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
