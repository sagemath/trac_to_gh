Python 3 doctest fixes in `modules/with_basis/morphism.py`

In `morphism.py`, it says:

```
        Pickling fails (:trac:`17957`) because the attribute
        ``phi._inverse_on_support`` is a ``dict.get`` method which is
        not yet picklable::
```

This seems to no longer be true in Python 3. In Python 2:

```
sage: dumps({1:1}.get)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: expected string or Unicode object, NoneType found
```

In Python 3:

```
sage: dumps({1:1}.get)
b'x\x9ck`J\x8e\x8fO*\xcd\xcc)\xc9\xcc\x8b\x8f\xe7JO-I,))\xe2*d\xa8-dL.NLO\xd5+\xca\xccK/\xd6\xcb\xcc+IMO-\xe2\xcaM\xccN\x8d\x87q\n\x99"\x18\x19\x18\x18\x0c\x0b\x99[\x0bY\x82\nY3\x982\x80,\xb6\xa0B\xf6\xe2\x08f\xa0\x04\xd0\xb4B\x8e\xb6B\xce\xa0B.=\x00X\xd3 \x87'
```


I don't know why in the first batch of examples, `loads(dumps(phi)) == phi` returns `False` in Python 3, but I put in what I hope is a suitable replacement.

Replying to [comment:2 jhpalmieri]:

My guess is that equality is done by comparing the defining functions, which after pickling are different (because of the different `dict`s).

This change LGTM.
