# Issue 34503: dead hyperlink in developer manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34740

Original creator: @DavidAyotte

Original creation time: 2022-11-10 20:35:39

Keywords: hyperlinks

The hyperlink for the Sphinx documentation in the section:

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#hyperlinks

is a dead link: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/markup/inline.html

Looking at the sphinx documentation, I'm not sure what is the right section one should link to.

It seems that `http://www.sphinx-doc.org/markup/inline.html` can be replaced with `https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html`
