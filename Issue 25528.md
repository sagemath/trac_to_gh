# Issue 25528: Add some more SBox constructions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25765

Original creator: asante

Original creation time: 2018-07-04 09:45:51

Keywords: sbox, days94

There are several SBox constructions known that exhibit some nice properties (e.g. Gold, Kasami, ... functions). Also, for 4-bit S-boxes, there are 302 affine equivalence classes - in my opinion it would be quite useful to have a representative for each in the sboxes module.

Hi Friedrich,

1. Can you provide references where these constructions were proposed ?
2. For SBoxes constructed by polynomial over an extension field (bracken-leander, gold, kasami, and welch), I suggest the extension field is provided as an optional argument. For instance `bracken_leander(n, base_field=None)`

I think its not necessary to have a `base_field` input argument, as the polynomials are only used to construct the sbox and are never returned from the function. So as a user calling this function, I have no chance of observing the actual used polynomial.

Friedrich,

Patchbot are failing in this ticket. This ticket depends on #25744 but the branch of this ticket does not implement the construction of SBox using univariate polynomial.

Comment by asante created at 2018-07-23 13:06:37

So this is not handled by the dependencies field and I should merge the #25744 branch?


---

Comment by ruhm created at 2018-07-23 13:28:21

Yap. Apparently thats what happened. I have also checked out the branch and run doctests locally and it failed because the constructor in the SBox module does not handle the univariate polynomial input.

I refactor the code by implementing a generic `monomial_function`, since some of the construction belong to a class of monomial function.

looks good to me.

what do we do about review? Do we now need a third person for review?

Replying to [comment:13 asante]:

Indeed. The "dependencies" field is just for administration, it doesn't automatically merge anything.

Rusydi if the ticket is now fine with you, we can set it to positive review.

I have failures to build the doc but I am not certain this is caused by this ticket:

The references have been missing for some time, but this ticket seems to have triggered the failures - possibly.

Try "make doc-clean && make doc" if you are having issues with docbuilding

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
