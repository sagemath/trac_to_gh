There are several SBox constructions known that exhibit some nice properties (e.g. Gold, Kasami, ... functions). Also, for 4-bit S-boxes, there are 302 affine equivalence classes - in my opinion it would be quite useful to have a representative for each in the sboxes module.

Hi Friedrich,

1. Can you provide references where these constructions were proposed ?
2. For SBoxes constructed by polynomial over an extension field (bracken-leander, gold, kasami, and welch), I suggest the extension field is provided as an optional argument. For instance `bracken_leander(n, base_field=None)`
