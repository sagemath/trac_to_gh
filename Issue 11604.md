A function that holds its arguments unevaluated, something like


```
hold_all(expression)
```

would be very nice, if implemented. It would be very useful when teaching Sage to students, and in general it would facilitate printing results together with the unevaluated expression.

Please have a look at http://test.sagenb.org/home/pub/6, it is a worksheet that explains (in detail, I hope) how a function like hold_all() would be useful in practice.

Given that `expression` is already evaluated (leading to a simplified expression) before `hold_all` even gets a hold of it, this approach is a little problematic. The basic feature is already available, but perhaps not very convenient for your taste. See `sin(pi,hold=True)`. Currently this isn't available for integrals etc., but there is
`sage.calculus.calculus.dummy_integrate(x^2+1,x)`
It is very reasonable to ask for `integrate(x^2+1,x,hold=True)` to be synonymous with that.

You can already do

```
def held(f):
    return lambda *args: f(*args,hold=True)
sin=held(sin)
cos=held(cos)
sin(pi)^2+cos(pi)^2
```

one could have a package inert_symbolic_functions that has (essentially) those declarations, so that a

```
from held_symbolic_functions import *
```

would give you a "held" environment. With a little namespace injection magic one could probably also use that to implement

```
with held_function_context:
   expr=sin(pi)^2+cos(pi)^2
```

which is probably the closest to what you request, subject to being doable in python.

I know, that's why I suggested a different approach in the end of the Sage worksheet I posted (http://test.sagenb.org/home/pub/6). Something like


```
unevaluated_expr=hold_all( integrate(x^2+1,x) + diff(tan(x),x) )
```

then a command to evaluate it, if needed, say


```
evaluated_expr=evaluate(unevaluated_expr)

```

So one could pretty print the unevaluated expression, together with the the evaluated one with


```
join(["$",unevaluated_expr,"=",evaluated_expr,"$"])

```

Note that such a functionality is pretty much standard in many Computer Algebra systems. Maxima, for example, suspends evaluation if an expression is preceded by a single quote, and has a very convenient function called `ev()` to evaluate the expression (or even parts of it) later on, so one could use


```
unevaluated_expr : '( integrate(x^2+1,x) + diff(tan(x),x) )
evaluated_expr : ev(unevaluated_expr)
print(unevaluated_expr,"=",evaluated_expr)
```

where everything inside `'(...)` is not evaluated. The same thing can be done in Mathematica and even yacas. I was actually surprised Sage doesn't have an easy way to do the same.

Well, the very basic feature is already available, indeed, but not for every function and not in a way one could call "convenient". Furthermore, `integrate()` was just an example.

Well, doable, but sounds like reinventing the wheel, in my humble  opinion. Not to mention it works only for functions that accept `hold=True`, and I have no idea how I will suspend evaluation of operators that way.

Basically what is needed is a flag on SR that sets "hold=True" to be the default rather than "hold=False". I don't know how easy and how thread-safe such a flag would be. It would definitely violate the stipulation that parents be immutable.

A "clean" solution would be to allow a second instance of SR that does have "hold=True" as default? This would allow something that you'll probably find painful too:

```
sage: SRheld = SymbolicRing( hold_by_default = True )
sage: SRheld(1) + SRheld(3) #note the need to turn 1,3 into symbolic objects before adding
1 + 3
sage: x = SRheld.var('x')
sage: integrate(x^2+1,x)
integral(x^2+1,x)
sage: xt = SR(x) # the normal SR still behaves as before
sage: integrate(xt^2+1,xt)
1/3*x^3+x
```

I'm afraid the proposed namespace magic I proposed earlier will never fully work because `SR(1).__add__(3)` can't be reached that way. So we need to find a convenient place to store the "hold default value". SR itself would be a reasonable place except that changing the value definitely changes how SR behaves and parents are supposed to be immutable.

Perhaps if we make a context manager that sets and resets a "hold_by_default" flag, we localize the potential trouble a bit. `localvars` has set a precedent for such:

```
with held_function_context(SR):
   expr=sin(pi)^2+cos(pi)^2
```

If in addition it would hold a lock on SR we would be thread safe as well (just not very thread friendly).

I think there is merit in having "hold" facilities more readily available but to implement it requires some serious architectural considerations and likely some relatively comprehensive modifications.
