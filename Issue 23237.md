# Issue 23237: Make is_galois work for higher degree number fields

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jwj

Original creation time: 2017-07-19 20:04:53

Keywords: sd87

Currently, the method is_galois only works in smaller degrees since it has pari compute the Galois group of the field.  This can be fixed by counting automorphisms of the field instead.

Tests pass. All the (three) lines of code seem sensible, so positive review.

```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/gal_reps.py  # Timed out
```

because 

```
EllipticCurve([1,-1,0,-107,-379]).galois_representation().image_type(7)
```

hangs...

Added degree check before attempting to compute the Galois group of a division polynomial.  The problem with Galois representations of elliptic curves relied on galois_group() to give up if the degree was greater than 11 (it explicitly used pari).  Now image_type does the check before calling galois_group.

Tests pass and it looks good.
