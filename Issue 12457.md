Linbox has its infamous `DISABLE_COMMENTATOR` #define.  When compiling code with this flag set, the commentator is disabled.  But Linbox itself is compiled with the commentator enabled.  Because the Sage library is built with the commentator disabled, this creates the following problem:

1. The disabled commentator is constructed using a dummy constructor.
2. That commentator is then destructed using the real destructor, causing havoc.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12629
