I'm not sure whether we really want to fix that, renaming `row` here seems stupid.  I wonder why pyflakes reports this at all.  Should I do

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage/combinat/tableau.py b/src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
index 1458df4..8679377 100644
--- a/src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
+++ b/src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
`@``@` -7595,18 +7595,18 `@``@` class StandardTableaux_shape(StandardTableaux):
         #Set the initial tableau by filling it in going down the columns
         tableau = [[None]*n for n in pi]
         size = sum(pi)
-        row = 0
-        col = 0
+        r = 0
+        c = 0
         for i in range(size):
-            tableau[row][col] = i+1
+            tableau[r][c] = i+1
 
             #If we can move down, then do it;
             #otherwise, move to the next column over
-            if ( row + 1 < len(pi) and col < pi[row+1]):
-                row += 1
+            if ( r + 1 < len(pi) and c < pi[r+1]):
+                r += 1
             else:
-                row = 0
-                col += 1
+                r = 0
+                c += 1
 
         yield self.element_class(self, tableau)
```

(besides, why isn't this reported at https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/25864/LinuxMint/18.2/x86_64/4.4.0-122-generic/rk02-math/2018-07-18%2013:20:54?plugin=pyflakes

Does rk02-math use a more intelligent pyflakes?

There are probably various versions of pyflakes, given different results.

ok, let us move on.

It would actually be great if the patchbot log contained the versions of the tools used. (I just upgraded pyflakes to 2.0, which - unfortunately - is reporting the renaming of `row`, too.)
