Shouldn't you bump the version number in package-version.txt to trigger a rebuild?
(Ok, on system where this is actually needed, ATLAS could not build before...)

And document the patch in SPKG.txt...

There is no need to rebuild ATLAS on every system after this patch, so I see no reason to bump the patchlevel.
