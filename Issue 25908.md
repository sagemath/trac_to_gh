# Issue 25908: py3: hashing of cartesian product elements

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2018-08-28 07:39:12


```
sage: C = cartesian_product([ZZ,ZZ])
sage: b = C((1,1))
sage: hash(b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-11-ad85d8b55702> in <module>()
```


This seems part of #24551.

indeed, hash does not exist, even if it appears in the tab completion:

```
sage: A = cartesian_product([ZZ, ZZ])
sage: elt = A((1,1))
sage: elt.__eq__
<method-wrapper '__eq__' of CartesianProduct_with_category.element_class object at 0x7f289e0953b8>
sage: elt.__hash__
```

Looks similar to the problem here:

```
sage:  w = Word([0,1,1,0])
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
sage: w.__eq__
<method-wrapper '__eq__' of FiniteWord_list object at 0x7f840419ec78>
sage: w.__hash__
```

Maybe there is something to change in the way cython handles the `__richcmp__` methods ?

Replying to [comment:2 chapoton]:

Fix LGTM, but can someone explain what is going on: The class `ElementWrapper` has a `__hash__` defined; the class `ElementWrapperCheckWrappedClass` is derived from `ElementWrapper`, so there should be the same `__hash__` used. Why does this not work (with Py3)?

Probably because it redefines comparison `__richcmp__`, which itself is used by Cython to redefine `__eq__`.. just a guess..
