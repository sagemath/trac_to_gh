Looks similar to the problem here:

```
sage:  w = Word([0,1,1,0])
sage: type(w)
<class 'sage.combinat.words.word.FiniteWord_list'>
sage: w.__eq__
<method-wrapper '__eq__' of FiniteWord_list object at 0x7f840419ec78>
sage: w.__hash__
```

Maybe there is something to change in the way cython handles the `__richcmp__` methods ?

Fix LGTM, but can someone explain what is going on: The class `ElementWrapper` has a `__hash__` defined; the class `ElementWrapperCheckWrappedClass` is derived from `ElementWrapper`, so there should be the same `__hash__` used. Why does this not work (with Py3)?
