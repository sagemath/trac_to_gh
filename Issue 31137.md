In line 1483 in sage.quadratic_forms.genera.normal_form we have

```
        b = [[0,5], [2,7], [1,2], [0,3], [0,1,5], [1,2,7], [0,3,7], [0,1,3]]
        if x in b:
            w = W[-1]
            if x == [3,7]:
                w = W[0]
```

The second if statement is never true due to a typo.
It should be `x == [0,3,7]`. 
Actually the bug is cleaned up later so the output should be correct anyways.
