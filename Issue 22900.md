You should make `sort_key` a hidden function as it serves no fundamental purpose other than for the CFM. I think it is better to spell out `\prec`/`\succ` rather than sub with `<`/`>`. Also, this should be code format: `- `i` -- an integer`. Otherwise, LGTM.

One last thing, you should mark those docstrings that have latex as raw `r"""` (I am probably being paranoid here, but that paranoia doesn't really hurt us). Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
