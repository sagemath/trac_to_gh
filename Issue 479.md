Hello,

The current LinBox package in Sage 2.8.2 has the following assignments in spkg-install


```
CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\"-L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\""
CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fPIC -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\"  -L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\""
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS  -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include/linbox\" -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL\"/include"
```

but uses the configure with the following options:

```
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-givaro="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-ntl="$SAGE_LOCAL" $OPS --with-blas="$LINBOX_BLAS"
```

This is due to a bug in LinBox where for exmaple GMP_CFLAGS is not propagated down into the Makefiles (via Makefile.am). I have fixed this for the GMP and I assume that it is the same fix for NTL and Givaro. The GMP fix already made it into LinBox-20070814.spkg and I did verify on my systems that the right gmp selected during configure is also linked against. Once I have made the fixes for NTL and Givaro I will push those fixes toward LinBox upstream.

Cheers,

Michael

Well, this should be trivial to fix. Any takers?

Cheers,

Has this one been addressed in the meantime, due to Kirkby's many helpful flag comments?

linbox appears to have several errors. 

 * #7058 
 * -m64  (a GNUism in itself) hard coded on only OS X, so it will not build 64-bit with Solaris. 
 * The issues you mention here. 
 * The fact -fPIC is a GNU specific flag. 

I'm a bit reluctant to go around editing any more spkg-install files, until we have in place a better system for dealing with the 64-bit issues which is not dependent on a particular platform or compiler. This spkg-install makes the assumption the only compiler is gcc (not true) and the only operating system on which one might want to force a 64-bit build is OS X (again not true). It was rather short-sighted the way this SAGE64 issue was handled. 

Once there is a way of handling this better, I'll revise this. #7505 is needing review and will allow the compiler to be determined. Later I will add an updated version of sage-env, which will set the flags globally. But it needs #7505 to be integrated first.
