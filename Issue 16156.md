# Issue 16156: change some upper bound names and arguments in sage/coding

from the discussion in #15438:

to make the input of all the code bounds coherent we should name some new functions, deprecate the old ones, and make sure that all the inputs follow the same pattern.

Not yet ready for review. I am waiting on [optional doctests](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/qAI57GFh02k/discussion), which should work out just fine, but they don't. All this and other confusion led me to commit to #15438. Gaaaahhhh!!

Setting it to needs review. Three doctests (depending on GAP) fail, but they fail even in 6.4beta4 without this patch.

Hello,

Why would you import such stuff in the global namespace ? It is a complete nonsense. I would rather *remove* all of `codesize_upper_bound`, `singleton_bound_asymp`, `plotkin_bound_asymp`, `elias_bound_asymp` and `mrrw1_bound_asymp` from the global namespace. First of all, some of these names are not fully expanded as they should be. Most importantly, I think that most of the users will not use that at all and can not even guess what it could be.

In order to have a clean interface, I strongly suggest to prefix all of these with the namespace `codes` (as it is the case with `designs` for example). In other words

```
sage: codes.bounds.plotkin(10,2,3)
192
sage: codes.bounds.elias(10,2,3)
232
```


That way, to have access to all bounds for codes you would just have to do

```
sage: codes.bounds.<TAB>
```

which is much more natural.

Bounds are not only of interest for codes, right? So please clean it up!

Vincent

I will look into it. But it won't be anytime soon. Pretty tied up with other stuff now.
