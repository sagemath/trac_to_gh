If you set `SAGE_CHECK=warn`, it doesn't behave just like passing the `-w` flag to `sage-spkg`: the latter sets `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES=x`, while the former does not. Therefore the default setting `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'` gets used with the former.

What is the intent?

I set SAGE_CHECK=warn to enable this behavior as a default for all packages. I don't see why the default `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES='!python2,!python3'` should not apply. In my test scripts, I set `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` to more exclusions (for example, ppl has a testsuite that takes very long.)

Makefile targets, I don't think. We could make it `configure` options though. (In some follow-up ticket.)

If `SAGE_CHECK_PACKAGES` is not empty, then setting `SAGE_CHECK=warn` should not affect that.

At first glance it looks good, but I have to test it. Ideally if I run `make` with `SAGE_CHECK=warn`, then there would be summary information at the end. ("The build succeeded but the following packages failed their test suites: ...") Any ideas how to do that?

Well, the code for the summary "The following package(s) may have failed to build..." is currently only run on failure.
I suppose we could run it on success too if `SAGE_CHECK=warn`...
