This happens often, but not always when testing on 32-bit:

```
File "src/sage/tensor/differential_form_element.py", line 328, in sage.tensor.differential_form_element.DifferentialForm
Failed example:
    form2.diff().degree()
Expected:
    2
Got:
    exception: exponent too large to convert to mpfr2

The "exception: exponent too large to convert to mpfr" is coming from arb. It should have called flint_abort which is just a define for abort and terminated the process, but for some reason it didnt. The final 2 is printed, too.

The error comes from evaluating

```
exp(cos(x)).subs({x: CIF(-50.3035873016558,- 25.1526638467043)})
```

when testing whether a certain coefficient of the differential form is zero. This value cannot be represented in 32-bit mpfr, we catch the exception and continue testing at a different point. I think this part just works as intended.

The problem is simply that arb writes 'exception: exponent too large to convert to mpfr2' to its stderr, which may or may not be captured in the doctest stderr stream.
