Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-06-15 16:00:18

well, I don't quite know how to deal with it. The rebased branch works for me. Should we revert all these rebases, and just hope that the merges will work?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-15 16:01:46

Yes, please restore to the unrebased ones. I know that the merges work, I am already testing on them


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-06-15 16:02:46

It's also fine with me if you *merge* in the current develop, but rebasing is too disruptive.
