The output weirdness in that last commit has nothing to do with set partitions btw:

```
sage: Set([2,3,5,8])
{8, 2, 3, 5}
sage: frozenset([2,3,5,8])
frozenset({2, 3, 5, 8})
```

Added a little commit that corrects some doc and replaces `sorted(uniq(...))` by the slightly faster `sorted(set(...))`. Hope that the patchbot is no longer confused.

Essentially a trivial rebase over #25155.

That was a trivial doc fix. Can the patchbots now do their job at last?
