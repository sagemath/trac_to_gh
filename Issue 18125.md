And if you don't set positive now the next version of develop will make a new pass necessary.

Would be better to test it on some linux 32 bits and an OS X. This is why I mentioned on which computer I did test it. If nobody shows up in a week for testing on other architecture, I will set the positive review.

Would be nice but not necessary. The reviewer cannot possibly review every combinations. That's the work of the bot. The reviewer should do what they see fit and do whatever exotic tests they have in mind. You have a concern about OS X? That's fine! Gut feeling or something you suspect from the review?

Anyway I'll quickly build it on OS X and do a few tests. Once it's done, I'll set it to positive review.
