timdumol, I'm assuming you forgot to set this as needing review.  If you feel it's not ready for review, you should set it to needs_work.

Since #8961 is now merged, should we close this ticket?

This patch has undergone major bitrot, and will be completely useless once the new UI branch is merged in. Can this please be closed?
