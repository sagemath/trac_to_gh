Maybe add spaces after commas (PEP8) while you're at it? ie replace:

```
,digits=
, digits=
```

Please spare my time. Pep8 is for the code, not for the documentation.

IMHO if pep8 is a good practice for the code, i don't see why it wouldn't be pertinent in the documentation. Especially in the examples where it make sense to promote good coding practice.

That being said that's not this ticket goal. 

Looks good to me.
