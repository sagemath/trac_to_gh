I find `--which` a horrible name: who would guess that `./sage --which` returns the Python major version number?

Why not be explicit and use `--python-version`? If it's mainly for scripts, the longer name doesn't matter.

One may even wonder if the new option is needed at all: the patchbot could instead use `./sage --python --version`. That would return `Python 2.7.15` instead of `2` but surely that can be dealt with.

I guess it is easier to parse but I'd rather have complete info myself. I may wanting if python has been updated or not for example.

I am trying to use this in a patchbot

```
def get_python_version(sage_cmd):
    """
    get the python version run by sage
    """
    res = subprocess.check_output([sage_cmd,
                                   "--python", "--version"],
                                  stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    return res
```

and this fails by always giving me `'Python 2.7.15\n'` even when `sage_cmd` is the sage in my sage3 install.

ok, maybe we can just close this one as invalid. Patchbot seems to be working correctly with "--python --version"...

This was my thought exactly when I saw this ticket :)  But thanks for thinking to add it, it will be helpful.
