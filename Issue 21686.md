CC:  @rwst

There is an easily reproducible bug with assumptions:

```
sage: var("p", domain="positive")
p
sage: assume(p<1)
sage: bool(p<1)
True
sage: bool(p^2<1)
True
sage: bool(p^6<1) # Should be True
False
```


The same happens for `var("p")` and then assuming `assume(p>0)`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21923

It is well known that there is no reasoning capability in Sage. See for example this thread: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/AiPtd0x52kQ/WeOmvlFCEAAJ

The `assume` command mainly sets Maxima assumptions for use in DEs and integrals. Everything else is experimental.

Yes, this is already in Maxima:

```
(%i1) assume(p>0);
(%o1)                               [p > 0]
(%i2) assume(p<1);        
(%o2)                               [p < 1]
(%i3) is(p^2<1); 
(%o3)                                true
(%i4) is(p^6<1);        
(%o4)                               unknown
```

Now I see that http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/maxima_11.html#assume mentions
 Maxima's deduction mechanism is not very strong; there are many obvious consequences which cannot be determined by is. This is a known weakness. 
But Maxima does have a tristate, as can be seen above. See #17700 for more.

Should the milestone of this ticket be changed to sage-duplicate or to sage-wishlist?

I am not sure such tickets should be closed like that. Indeed, compared to #19162, there is a concrete use case (a bug), so it is important to keep track of it in the doctests, even if the fix comes from another ticket. At least, we have to copy the doctest on the other ticket, in order not to lose it.
