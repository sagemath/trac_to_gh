Can we keep this ticket open to track all the remaining IPython issues?

Still outstanding:

From Kannappan Sampath:

1. I am unable to exit by typing "exit", but Ctrl+D however works! 
2. Usually on the first run of sage, I receive some directive from Sage asking me not to interrupt as it is setting some paths. I did not receive such a directive this time... 

I don't know if (2) is our problem, but we should double-check that the message isn't disabled if it should be printed

Regarding (3), loading a sage file (i.e., %runfile init.sage) certainly works with sage syntax like load.  So the problem appears to be that the %runfile code isn't being used to run init.sage.

I've noticed that attach no longer works. It says it's been deprecated and to use %attach, but then this appears to have a bug.

If I have a file "test.py" which contains one line

print "hello"

then when I attach:

%attach 'test.py'

then it prints hello. But if I rewrite the line to:

print "hey"

and then hit enter on sage, it doesn't print anything.

I don't quite understand what the problem is. Is it a problem that simply hitting ENTER doesn't reload the file, that the file is only reloaded before executing an actual command?
