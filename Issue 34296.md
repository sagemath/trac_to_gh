# Issue 34296: OS X 12.6 "chained fixups" warning

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34533

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2022-09-14 20:24:12

The upgrade to OS X 12.6 leads to a number of failing doctests because of a warning

```
ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups
```

Let's ignore this warning when parsing doctest output.

It would also be nice to know where this is coming from and deal with it at its root.

Changing priority from major to blocker.

I'm making this a blocker since we currently have failing doctests on a supported platform.

I don't know if this really needs to be a blocker

I'm not sure, either, but it would be best to have a release that passes doctests on all supported platforms.

Seems safe enough, and its unlikely to accidentally hide a real error

Thank you (and as I said earlier, it would be nice to understand why this has begun happening and deal with it rather than hide it).

For your info:

- `-undefined dynamic_lookup` is a usual flag (in macos) given to the dynamic linker (dyld) to "dynamically lookup undefined symbols".

- The only webpage I found that explains "chained fixups" is: https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/iOS15LaunchTime

Still I don't understand the warning message and "why this has begun happening" :)
