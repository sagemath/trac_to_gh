Thanks a lot, Jeroen. By the way, would you please give your opinion on #27065 ?

I don't understand these tests.  They seem kind of pointless?  If we _must_ have doctests for `__hash__` methods can they at least prove that they maintain whatever invariant the hash is meant to maintain (which in this case is trivial, but still more meaningful than testing that `hash(X)` doesn't crash).

Ahem.. <grumbl>Time lost will never come back.</grumbl>

So, Erik, please tell us exactly what you would like to see as doctests here. Or better, just commit something that suits you and pass on both py2 and py3.

I'm sorry, I'd be frustrated too, but in the same vein I don't think we should waste time writing pointless doctests that prove nothing.

I personally have no idea what the intent is here for these classes implementing `__hash__` or if there's even any reason for them to do so at all.  Perhaps we should find that out.

Just looking at the code I have no reason--it's not documented anywhere--why RDF has to be hashable at all.  I'm sure there's a reason, but it would be nice if that were actually explained somewhere.  Furthermore I have no idea, even if the class is intended to be used as a singleton, why its hash it set to a (seemingly) arbitrary integer, nor why the old test expected that value to be equivalent to `hash(str(RDF))` modulo `2^32`.  I'd want to know that before just kind of sweeping things under the rug.

The [commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/src/sage/rings/real_double.pyx?id=44c1f6af03c02153ae88e954d3ca418f1e9505ae) where the original test for RDF was written to its previous form (I'll look at CDF separately) just says "Clean up the fallout from the RDF/CDF hashing patch" which doesn't really answer anything.

In particular I don't get the "mod 2!^32" part, although it does appear to hold accurate on Python 2.  Though it seems part of the point is that `hash(RDF)` and `hash(str(RDF))` are _not_ the same:


```
sage: {RDF: 1, str(RDF): 2}
{Real Double Field: 1, 'Real Double Field': 2}
```


ISTM part of the point of giving it a fixed value was at some point primarily for some performance purpose, but it's not clear what that purpose was exactly or what benchmark this was targeting.

It's clear to me that the only thing that matters is that `hash(RDF)` works and that it gives a constant (within one Python session at least) value. So there is nothing wrong with `return 561162115` as implementation.

Replying to [comment:8 embray]:

I think the reason for this, at least, was that on 32-bit Python the str hashing function overflows, whereas on 64-bit it isn't as likely to overflow for a short string, but either way between 32-bit and 64-bit the hash values wind up the same modulo 2^!32.

That still raises the question of why there was a desire for `hash(RDF) == hash(str(RDF))` especially since that does not hold on 64-bit.

I think then it suffices to demonstrate that `hash(RDF) == hash(RealDoubleField_class())` and to mention that this class is intended for use as a singleton so any instance of it should be equivalent from a hashing perspective.
