I propose a choice of algorithm for computing the Mobius matrix of a poset : the current matrix inversion, or the classical recursive formula. The second one seems to be always faster..

Timings with the branch applied:

```
sage: P = posets.TamariLattice(5)
sage: H = P._hasse_diagram
sage: %time H.moebius_function_matrix()
CPU times: user 5.82 ms, sys: 150 µs, total: 5.97 ms
Wall time: 5.72 ms
42 x 42 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: H.__dict__.pop('_moebius_function_matrix')
42 x 42 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: %time H.moebius_function_matrix('matrix')
CPU times: user 53.5 ms, sys: 3.78 ms, total: 57.3 ms
Wall time: 56.8 ms
42 x 42 sparse matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)

There might be some benefit once the `lequal_matrix` has already been computed, but I agree with everything in this ticket, so it gets a positive review.
