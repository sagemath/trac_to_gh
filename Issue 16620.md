# Issue 16620: Add example(s) for ticks in plot doc

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2014-08-20 13:40:27

Keywords: beginner

[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23596/) suggests we need more documentation on how to change ticks for only one axis.  One suggested example is

```
xx = np.logspace(1,100,1000) 
yy = np.linspace(-180,180,1000) 
list_plot(xx,yy,scale=semilogx,ticks=[None, 30])
```

though neither of us has tested this yet.

I was unable to get the suggested example to work, as i get this error when trying it: 


```
TypeError: The second argument 'plotjoined' should be boolean (True or False).  
If you meant to plot two lists 'x' and 'y' against each other, 
use 'list_plot(zip(x,y))'.
```


Also i needed to add single quotes around semilogx, so i ended up with this:


```
list_plot(zip(xx,yy),scale='semilogx',ticks=[None, Integer(30)])
```


And it produces a plot successfully, but i have no idea if that plot is correct, now with these changes?

Certainly this would be the correct syntax, now that I see it.  Probably we should add some (non-semilog, non list plot) examples in a few other places where there are already ticks examples.  Nice!

I added an example to `plot` where only one axis is changed.
Since `list_plot` has no other examples with keywords, I decided to just add a reference to `show` there rather than adding the same example in two places.
All the other plot functions also makes references to [show](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.plot) or [plot](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.show) for full details.

I realized now that I branched from `develop`, is this OK? Should I branch from `master` instead?

Replying to [comment:7 ljern]:
> I added an example to `plot` where only one axis is changed.

I would redirect to `plot` instead of `show` since `show` does more than `plot`. `plot` returns a plot object, whereas `show` returns `None` and displays a plot. In an analogy, `plot` is like a function that returns a string, whereas `show` is like `print`.

> I realized now that I branched from `develop`, is this OK? Should I branch from `master` instead?

You should always try to base things off `develop` as it is far less likely to have any merge conflicts or behavior changes.

We've been putting white space between the arguments of Sage commands but not within the arguments. The command


```
plot(x^2,(x,300,500),ticks=[100,50000])
```


reads better as


```
plot(x^2, (x,300,500), ticks=[100,50000])
```


Please make that change in the immediate section on which you're working. Thanks!

Lennart, when I asked you to add yourself to authors I meant on the Trac ticket, not in the documentation.

One more change I would like to see it four instances of `1,27` changed to `1, 27`. Thanks!

Oh I see, that makes sense! Thank you for the guidance :)
I guess I should also merge the develop branch into this to make it up to date, right?

Patch with all changes

Attachment

You aren't required to merge the current develop branch if it doesn't affect your code. Some people do that regularly to avoid possible merge conflicts and to decrease the time it takes to rebuild after changes. I personally don't because it complicates the history of a branch in the Git repository, and rebuild time can be decreased significantly in any case by installing `ccache`.

You also don't need to include a patch with all changes. The commits to Git are cumulative, and you can see the total result by clicking on the branch at the top of this ticket.

The documentation builds and looks good. One more minor change: add a space so `x^2,(x,480,500)` is `x^2, (x,480,500)` to match the edit in the Sphinx plot. After that its good to go and I'll give it positive review.
