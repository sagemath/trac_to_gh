I implemented this "dim" argument so that `my_variable[2][3]` would work, and before noticing that `my_variable[2,3]` worked too, and actually better. Thus this useless code should be removed, and I was probably the only one to use it in the first place `:-)`

Wow. I did not realise there were so many LP in Sage `O_o`

I am getting

```
[numerical] docstring of sage.numerical.mip.MixedIntegerLinearProgram.set_binary:27: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
```

and the docbuild bails out with `OSError` at the same line. Not sure which line of `mip.pyx` is causing the trouble...
