Can you please remove all changes from this ticket which are not in docstrings or comments?

And also remove the changes to `quadratic_forms` to avoid a conflict with #18168.

Thanks, Jeroen, for having a look. I did remove any changes to the code, and also to quadratic forms.
By the way, have you received my mail about your patchbot ?
