Tried to investigate, but so far got no idea why this can fail.

This import works in a python session in sage-shell. And in sage itself too.
And there are other places in the code of sage where six.moves is already used.

still not working. This ticket seems to be *much more* tricky than expected.

ok, this trouble was all caused by the existence of a module named "six" in sage/misc.

Should be good now.
