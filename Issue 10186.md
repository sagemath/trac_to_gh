Please update ecl and maxima to the newest upstream release. Sage packages are here:

http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/ecl-10.4.1.p0.spkg
http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/maxima-5.22.1.spkg

Note that you cannot upgrade one without the other; Both need to be upgraded simultaneously or build will fail.

Relevant tickets for ecl:

* #9264: Apply ALL relevent fixes to ECL 10.4.1: As far as I can tell all relevant patches are included in ecl-10.4.1.p0.spkg.

* #9493: Remove extra baggage from ECL 10.2.1.p1 (again): Patch is included and #9493 can be closed after this ticket.

* #10185: the old ecl-10.2.1 does not build on Fedora 14: Fixed with the updated ecl from this ticket.

Relevant tickets for maxima:

* #8645: ECL library "maxima.fasb" is built at new location. The patches from this bug have been incorporated into the maxima spkg, and #8645 can be closed after this ticket.

* #8731: update/upgrade maxima to latest upstream (5.21.1): Latest upstream is nowadays 5.22.1.

* #8582: `sum(1/(1+k^2), k, -oo, oo)` returns 0: The new maxima seems to be able to evaluate this correctly, at leasts it returns some expression with digamma functions.

The updated maxima code seems to be more careful about signs which leads to doctest errors.

```

The doctests show one maxima regression: 

```
sage: t = log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1); t
log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1)
sage: u = t.maxima_methods(); u
MaximaWrapper(log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1))
sage: u.logcontract()
log((sqrt(2) - 1)*(sqrt(2) + 1))
```

This simplified to 0 in a previous version. But at least its not wrong ;-)

The attached patch fixes all doctests except for a timeout in maxima. That one is a different issue with maxima, which forgets to print the `general-display-prefix` variable for errors:

```

One thing we don't don, which I think would be sensible, is to include the test suite for ECL. That adds 1.7 MB. From the README.ECL file:


```
	cd tests
	make

You will find two types of output files:

	*.out	The whole output of a test
	*.erg	The errors arising from a test

When there is no *.erg, it means that ECL passed the test.
```


Would it not be sensible to add these in? Then we could execute the tests with a spkg-check file, like we do other code which has self-tests.

Just a very minor note:

# we are now getting three lines of commented verbosity 
```

but of course you changed it to get rid of the extra two lines from our constantly added packages :) so it's now five lines.  Might as well change that too so future people are confused.

I looked trough doctest patch and compared it with mine from #8731, I have few comments.

I think that doctest fix for sage/calculus/functional.py should be modified - it was documentation of the use of assume, but now - when maxima can calculate this integral without assumption, isn't that same as applying assumption to result? And the integral is checked in other doctest now. Maybe there is better example that still needs the assume to get result?

Also the doctest in sage/misc/functional.py was here to demonstrate numerical approximation of integral that cannot be evaluated iirc, and now when it can be evaluated, I think it should be changed to something that cannot be - like Jason did in patch in #8731.

Finally, there is typo in doctest to sage/symbolic/expression.pyx - it should say that this doctest is here to check that #7334 not #7344 is fixed (#7344 point to libjpeg issue so it cannot be it) - and it should stay in here unmodified. Also - the log thing - it's not exactly regression, it's feature. This is because of Maxima ticket 947808 - http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=947808&group_id=4933&atid=104933 - they now try to keep the expression as factored as they can without using factor. This results in observed behaviour. This doctest I think cannot be changed as it demonstrated that ticket is solved, but we should apply "x = x.simplify_rational()" after "x = x.simplify_log('one')" in definition of simplify_full - that way full simplify would result in same results as before I think, and #7334 would be still fixed. Now, this doctest shows nothing.

There is a problem with the ECL package here. The history of all recent changes has been lost. The recent changes to the package have been:


```
### ecl-10.2.1.p3 (David Kirkby, David Kirkby, 17th September 2010)
### ecl-10.2.1.p2 (David Kirkby, 30th July 2010)
### ecl-10.2.1.p1 (Mitesh Patel, 11th July 2010)
### ecl-10.2.1.p0 (David Kirkby, 11th July 2010)
### ecl-10.2.1 (William Stein, 14 February 2010)
```


but instead SPKG.txt shows


```
### ecl-10.4.1.p0 (Leif Leonhardy, Volker Braun, 29th September 2010)
### ecl-10.4.1 (N. Bruin, W. Stein, D. Kirkby and M. Patel 19th June 2010)
### ecl-10.2.1 (William Stein, 14 February 2010)
```


This error has occurred since the package is based on one that I created several months ago, which never got merged, because their were conflicts with that and the Maxima package at the time. 

The current version of ECL in Sage should have been used as a starting point - not an old one that was never merged. 

I'll sort the above problem out, and add the ECL test code today. 

Dave

I've now got the information on the ANSI test suite from the ECL developer, though I gather the copy on the ECL site is rather out of date. Also, the ECL developer has fixed the bug that causes #9840, so I'll patch that too, so #9840 can hopefully be closed at the same time.

I have put an updated ECL file at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.4.1.spkg This has only been checked on OpenSolaris - I don't have access to a Fedora 14 machine, so can't verify if it actually fixes the issues reported at #10185

I should make a few comments about this:

* I have not added an spkg-check file or the Lisp tests, as I gather from the ECL developer the Lisp tests on the ECL site are outdated. Fixing this appears to be a non-trivial issue. 
* The repository information from the ecl-10.2.1.p3 version actually in Sage is kept, as it should be. (Volker's package was based on a 10.4.1 package I created months ago, which never got merged into Sage. So the repository information was not correct). 
* Despite being told the Solaris text relocation issue was resolved, it appears it is not as simple as applying a single patch as I had hoped. So #9840 remains unresolved, though it should be fixed when the next stable ECL release is made. 
* I've cleaned the package up somewhat. 
* I did not remove the gmp sources, as doing so requires a new configure file to be created. Whilst I can see this is advantageous if done properly, I fear that this will be done incorrectly at some point in the future, which can result in chaos. 

After 
* Installing the new ECL package I created, and put at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/kirkby/patches/ecl-10.4.1.spkg 
* Installing the Maxima package from http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/maxima-5.22.1.spkg 
* Trying to install all the patches (one failed, see below)
* Rebuilding the Sage library. 
* Running all the doctests, which all pass. 

I get one reject out of six when adding 

`trac_10187_general_display_prefix_workaround.patch` 

to sage 4.6.1.alpha0, so I think that patch needs updating. The contents of the reject are: 


```

         if len(line) == 0:

```


But as I say, all doctests passed for me, despite one patch was not fully applied!! 


```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!

```


I'm leaving as needs work, as clearly the fact one patch does not apply cleanly is a problem. It also needs testing on more than one system, but I don't have access to the Fedora 14 system where this was a particular problem.

I've just started a build. It takes a bit over an hour to build Sage and run all the long doctests on this machine, but it's 11 pm local time. I'll try to get it done before going to bed, so I can report on it, but it might have to wait until tomorrow. I'm feeling rather tired here.

I have switched sage-on-gentoo to maxima-5.22.1 on sage-4.6's release I haven't run a 
long test of alpha1 with it but I haven't heard complaint from anyone running tests
on x86 and amd64 with 4.6.

Thank you. I must do some other things today, so don't have time to test this much. But hopefully we can get some testers on other platforms. To my knowledge we know nothing about

* Any OS X release
* Solaris 10 on SPARC
* Solaris 10 on x86

all of which are supported platforms.

Looks like it needs a commit message to apply straight-up with `hg_scripts`, so it's not ready as it stands, perhaps.

Without *either* of those patches, I get most relevant tests passing EXCEPT the `taylor(gamma(1/3+x),x,0,3)` one, on both OS X 10.6 Intel and 10.4 PPC.    The interfaces/maxima.py times out without both the workaround and lisp patch on 10.6, after which it's fine on that and sage/calculus, sage/symbolic, and sage/functions.  

I haven't tested that last combination of patches yet on my 10.4 machine, as it's very slow  - later today I might know more.

I've added a patch for `sage-maxima.lisp` as `trac_10187_sage-maxima_lisp.patch`. 

To summarize, you need to
1. Apply `trac_10187_sage-maxima_lisp.patch` to SAGE_LOCAL/bin

4. Apply trac_10187_fix_easy_doctests.patch to the sage library
5. Apply trac_10187_general_display_prefix_workaround.patch to the sage library

Its true, but completely pointless, that some doctests pass without some of these patches. Maxima's error reporting changed and we cannot use the old parser any more. Read this ticket for details.

There are several transpositions of `abs(z)*sin(theta)` in this one, just like the transposition of `psi(1, 1/3)*log(3)` in the other error.    

I get

'gamma(1/3)-(6*%gamma+%pi*sqrt(3)+9*log(3))*gamma(1/3)*x/6+(12*%gamma^2+(4*%pi*sqrt(3)+36*log(3))*%gamma+6*log(3)*%pi*sqrt(3)+%pi^2+27*log(3)^2+12*psi[1](1/3))*gamma(1/3)*x^2/24+(72*gamma(1/3)*psi[2](1/3)+(-72*%gamma^3+(-36*%pi*sqrt(3)-324*log(3))*%gamma^2+(-108*log(3)*%pi*sqrt(3)-18*%pi^2-486*log(3)^2-216*psi[1](1/3))*%gamma+(-%pi^3+(-81*log(3)^2-36*psi[1](1/3))*%pi)*sqrt(3)-27*log(3)*%pi^2-243*log(3)^3-324*psi[1](1/3)*log(3))*gamma(1/3))*x^3/432'
```

which looks like the 'expected' line.   I also get

```

```

which perhaps is the issue.  What do people who do not have problems with this doctest get for this?  (If the same for Maxima, but different for Sage, maybe it's a platform-dependent Pynac issue ... why on earth would that happen?)

Can you double-check that the maxima binary works? you should get:

Dan, thanks for that confirmation of the issue.

Actually, I'm pretty sure it's an unrelated bug in something else.  At first I thought Pynac/Ginac, but maybe not (?) - in Sage 4.6 on PPC, I get

```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)

sage: from sage.misc.citation import get_systems
sage: get_systems('psi(1,1/3)*log(3)')
['GMP']
```

This machine doesn't have the new Maxima, so it's definitely unrelated.

Nonetheless, we can't ship a Sage with a failing doctest that we know about, except at great need - this is why I put needs work.   The very minor change in how Maxima grouped the coefficient of `x^3` created this.

So I recommend that we replace this doctest with something very similar which doesn't have this problem, and then open a new ticket for this issue.  Maybe something like

```
sage: taylor(gamma(1/4+x),x,0,3)
```

except I can't tell you what the Mac output is on this until tomorrow - maybe someone else can.  

The new ticket is #10282.

I installed Sage on a Mac:

Machine Name:	Power Mac G5

  Machine Model:	PowerMac11,2

  CPU Type:	PowerPC G5 (1.1)



with Mac OS X:

  System Version:	Mac OS X 10.4.11 (8S165)

  Kernel Version:	Darwin 8.11.0

from binary packages:

http://www.sagemath.org/download-mac.html

and using cp -R - A ... to a custom directory because I don't have admin rights.

So I got Sage 4.6.

I ran Sage once.

I then patched sage_scripts (downloaded spkg, uncompressed, hg qimport patch, hg qpush) and installed it.

I installed ecl-10.4 and maxima5.22.1 spkgs.

I ran ./sage -b but got problem of paths, it was looking in /Users/Shared/sage/sage-4.6/ ...

So I moved my installation folder there and ./sage -b worked.

I then ran ./sage -t  -long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py

and everything was fine:




```
init.sage does not exist ... creating
sage -t -long -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima.py"
         [53.8 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 53.8 seconds
```

I'll try to test on a SPARC machine with Solaris 10 soon.

I'm currently running all long doctest on the Mac machine I have access to.

The Mac output for taylor(gamma(1/4+x),x,0,3) is:


```
sage: taylor(gamma(1/4+x),x,0,3)
-1/48*((12*(pi + 6*log(2))*euler_gamma^2 + pi^3 + 18*pi^2*log(2) + 8*euler_gamma^3 + 216*log(2)^3 + 12*(9*log(2)^2 + psi(1, 1/4))*pi + 6*(pi^2 + 12*pi*log(2) + 36*log(2)^2 + 4*psi(1, 1/4))*euler_gamma + 72*log(2)*psi(1, 1/4))*gamma(1/4) - 8*gamma(1/4)*psi(2, 1/4))*x^3 + 1/8*(4*(pi + 6*log(2))*euler_gamma + pi^2 + 12*pi*log(2) + 4*euler_gamma^2 + 36*log(2)^2 + 4*psi(1, 1/4))*x^2*gamma(1/4) - 1/2*(pi + 2*euler_gamma + 6*log(2))*x*gamma(1/4) + gamma(1/4)

On Linux with latest alpha I get :

which is not the same.Look at 72*...

```

Okay, so the failures are the same as on mine *before* I add the two patches to the Maxima interface.  

Summary:

1. All Macs have some sort of multiplication transposition, so we will either have to simultaneously fix #10282 or find different doctests for those two examples (the taylor of gamma and the matrix in plot3d/transform.pyx).

2. Debian and OpenSolaris seem ok.

3. Other Linux/Solaris still needed?

4. Finally, someone needs to actually review the content of the two Maxima interface change patches (one to Sage library, one to scripts library) and whether the spkgs do, in fact, have all properly changed (not that we don't believe the authors! just someone different needs to check them).

I still am getting this weird behavior of timeouts on mine.  The problem seems to be restarting Maxima.  Once Maxima is started, timings are slow but normal for this computer:

```
sage: time integrate(x^2,x)
CPU times: user 0.15 s, sys: 0.16 s, total: 0.31 s
Wall time: 134.04 s
1/3*x^3
sage: time integrate(x^2,x)
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.09 s
Wall time: 0.83 s
1/3*x^3
sage: time integrate(x^2,x)
CPU times: user 0.08 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.10 s
Wall time: 0.92 s
1/3*x^3
```

But I think the way doctests work is that things are restarted from function to function - is that right?

I'm going to try to see what is going on with my computer, but if jpflori is ok with a very similar one, it shouldn't hold things up - unless there is a reason a G4 would be this much slower than a G5?  I'm going to try downloading 4.6.1.alpha1, replacing the spkgs with the new ones, and then building from scratch to see what happens.

The very minor change in how Maxima grouped the coefficient of `x^3` created this. So I recommend that we replace this doctest with something very similar which doesn't have this problem, and then open a new ticket for this issue.  Maybe something like ` sage: taylor(gamma(1/4+x),x,0,3) ` except I can't tell you what the Mac output is on this until tomorrow - maybe someone else can.   The new ticket is #10282.

As noted by Burcin in #10282 , it is related to pynac ordering and applying the patch I provided in #9880 gives me a consistent behavior on Mac and Linux:


```
sage: psi(1,1/3)*log(3)
log(3)*psi(1, 1/3)

```

(I order the functions according to their name in lexicographic order)

However #9880 still needs a lot of work:

- my patch must be reviewed

- pynac must be updated

- a lot of doctests will have to be fixed afterwards

The new maxima certainly comes with a bigger library; Its inevitable that it is somewhat slower in exchange for being better at integration. I don't know why startup is so slow on kcrisman's antique computer, but stracing the maxima startup shows that it thrashes around quite a lot in the `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/maxima/5.22.1/` directory tree. 

For the record, Fedora 14 on a Thinkpad T410s Core i5:

```
sage: time integrate(x^3,x)

I say we should press ahead and update maxima so that Sage compiles on Fedora 14. If the new maxima starts up slowly on your hardware then file a ticket and see if you can profile/fix it.

On my [This is the Trac macro *QuadCore* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#QuadCore-macro) running Debian, here are the timings for the new Maxima:


```
sage: time integrate(x^3,x)

Wall time: 1.49 s
1/4*x^4

CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.06 s
1/4*x^4

```

and with the old Maxima:


```
sage: time integrate(x^3,x)
CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.02 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 1.42 s
1/4*x^4

CPU times: user 0.01 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.01 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
1/4*x^4

```

On the Power G5 with the new Maxima:


```
sage: time integrate(x^3,x)
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 0.10 s
Wall time: 4.04 s
1/4*x^4

sage: time integrate(x^3,x)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
1/4*x^4

```

and the old Maxima:


```
age: time integrate(x^3,x)
CPU times: user 0.04 s, sys: 0.07 s, total: 0.10 s
Wall time: 4.87 s
1/4*x^4

CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.01 s, total: 0.03 s
Wall time: 0.04 s
1/4*x^4

```

So it was actually faster with the new one.

I managed to update Ecl and Maxima on top of sage 4.5.1 on a Sunblade 1500 (SPARC with Solaris 10), but doctesting maxima.py timedout or died eating all the memory.

The Maxima spkg IMHO needs work; not sure if on another ticket. (I guess the authors will say yes; I personally don't like postponing spkg changes very much, since this tends to make them never happen, or leads to concurrent, "incompatible" changes.)

Besides minor things (like unquoted `SAGE_LOCAL`), unsetting `MAKE` and using `make` is a very bad thing to do. This doesn't work as expected (or intended) with `MAKE=make -j` by the way, and prohibits the user to use different `make`s, or pass other options in it.

(Currently `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/install` does similar if `SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD` is not "yes", but that's equally wrong, and that code isn't executed when doing e.g. `./sage -i ...`.)

Also, I see no reason for not removing GMP from the ECL source tree, which more than halves the size of the ECL spkg. This requires just a trivial change to `configure` s.t. a different copy of `install-sh` is used. (See #9493. To me it's pointless to create yet another spkg and bump the patch level for such a change when we're already at it, at least if it's likely to get merged into a different Sage release, which then causes completely useless downloads and rebuilds on upgrades.)

Such a patch to `configure` is a very good use case for the newly included GNU `patch`, since `configure` is huge while the patch is tiny, so putting a patched copy in `patches/` would again - now really unnecessarily - increase the size of the resulting spkg.

I'm not sure if there are other changes from the previous attempt to update ECL not made in the current spkg here.

What is the correct way to force-disable parallel make, then?

Apart from that, do you have any other issue than the unquoted `SAGE_LOCAL` (which this ticked did not add) for the maxima spkg? I'm happy to fix "minor things", but at the very least you have to list them if you want them fixed.

I don't think that saving 1 MB is good enough a reason to justify patching ecl's `configure` and maintaining that patch in future versions. If you want to save space then there are much bigger spkgs that could be shrunk. Or, better yet, if you have the time then fix some real bugs...

> What is the correct way to force-disable parallel make, then?

As long as we rely on a GNU `make`, the correct thing to do is

```sh
MAKE="$MAKE -j1" # force sequential build (1 job)
```

Otherwise we'd have to test if the actual `$MAKE` understands that.

> Apart from that, do you have any other issue than the unquoted `SAGE_LOCAL` (which this ticked did not add) for the maxima spkg? I'm happy to fix "minor things", but at the very least you have to list them if you want them fixed.

:) I don't recall. A major clean-up could be done, but I won't insist on having it here.

Yes, but they accumulate. I'm not sure if upstream would make such a patch.

Btw, it's more than 2 MB of the spkg, 13 MB uncompressed.

"Maintaining" a real patch is trivial. It will still apply or not, in which case an error message is given. The patch itself is also trivial.

P.S.: If someone fears `patch`, a trivial alternative is to simply keep the only file from there `configure` uses, which is a redundant copy anyway, so one could even create a symbolic link to one of the other instances.

* I've updated the ecl-10.4.1.spkg. The changes should be totally harmless - a copy which would never have occured, some changes of comments and the removal of some unused files. The md5 checksum should be `7a0d66ee152b847009b23b1dbbfeb75d`

> Such a patch to `configure` is a very good use case for the newly included GNU `patch`, since `configure` is huge while the patch is tiny, so putting a patched copy in `patches/` would again - now really unnecessarily - increase the size of the resulting spkg.

Agreed, but it would be unwise to start using GNU patch here for several reasons. 
* We have not agreed on how its best used (that's the subject of #9419)
* Patch is not in any stable release of Sage. It would be unwise to switch to using it extensively just now. 
* Robert Bradshaw stated we should not mix use the use of `patch` and `cp` in the same package. I'm not sure if I agree with that or not. I can see his logic, though I can see it could be an error prone process converting all the cp's to patches.

I'm not aware of any.

Need not be suddenly.

If e.g. just `make install` fails with multiple jobs, we could just do `$MAKE -j1 install`.

Also, failures might be limited to the OS (e.g. MacOS X), in which case we shouldn't disable parallel builds on all platforms.

If parallel builds or installs just non-deterministically fail in, say, 5-10%, it would IMHO be acceptable to enable them though, since on a failure one simply has to rerun `make` or `./sage -i ...`.

I can't do it now, but later I will try my old trick of building it 1000 times, inserting random delays before invoking gcc. I don't think a few]build in parallel proves very much. 

It took:


```
real    9m0.386s
user    5m4.518s
sys     0m43.198s
Successfully installed maxima-5.22.1
```


so I guess it would take about 6 minutes to build serially. So we will see see how long it takes to build in parallel and so how practical it is to test it 100 times or 1000 times.

I personally think it would be unwise to enable parallel builds unless we are confident they work reliably on every platform. It's conceivable a file may not be written fully, yet processed in some way, leading to undefined behavior. 

I've asked on the Maxima mailing list if parallel builds are OK or not. So far there is no reply. 

I've started a build of Maxima, inserting a random delay between 0 and 1 second before invoking gcc. The problem is, Maxima is now taking 11 and a half minutes to build on my machine. 


```
real    11m33.576s
user    3m22.703s
sys     0m29.970s
```


as obviously delaying gcc on average by 500 ms slows down the build. So far it has only built twice, but both times it was OK. 

I'll build a few more copies of Sage, then test Maxima on them too, since testing this even 100 times is going to take 19 hours. 

I've put to needs info, since I think we need to verify if parallel builds are ok or not. 

A new package, with parallel builds enabled, can be found at

I tried to build Maxima in parallel a number of times. It failed once with the following, so I think it is unwise to attempt a parallel build. 

This was without any random delays before invoking gcc, but on a heavily loaded system. 

We should use http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/maxima-5.22.1.spkg and **not** my parallel version.

On a Blade 1500, you will need to increase the values of the timeouts. I would suggest suitable values would be : 


```
SAGE_TIMEOUT=600
SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG=3000
```


I suspect the SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG could actually be 2000 seconds, but I'd go for 6000 to be really safe. 

I use:


```
SAGE_TIMEOUT=1000
SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG=10000
```


on a dual processor 900 MHz Blade 1000. I think however the SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG, which defaults to 1800 s, is probably not too far from ok, so I reckon 2000 s would be fine.

The default SAGE_TIMEOUT of 300 s will certainly be too short.

I did increase the timeout, to 20000 if I remember correctly.

However when I came back Sage had gotten out of memory (and the computer had to be restarted).

It could be because of the way I installed Sage (downloaded binary 4.5.1 package, updated the spkgs and could have used an old gcc at some point because the default one on the system is 3.4.something even if 4.something is available).

I should build everything from scratch but do not have the time right now.

Unless someone has changed this recently, if you run some doctest(s) with `-long`, **only** `SAGE_TIMEOUT_LONG` will be used, regardless if the file(s) contain(s) doctests marked "`long`".

(And the timeout applies to the whole file being doctested, not individual doctests in it.)

If you run out of memory (i.e., the machine starts to swap), increasing the timeout doesn't help much; it's better to then reduce the number of doctests run in parallel ("`NUM_THREADS`" in the Makefile).

FWIW, that's running Solaris 10 03/2005, so is an almost 6 year old version of Solaris. 

A later version of Solaris, if configured to use the 128-bit ZFS file system, then I doubt 2 GB would be sufficient. One could always use the old UFS file system, but ZFS has lots of advantages, but it tends to need more memory.

Don't know if I mentioned this earlier, but in the ECL spkg user-specified `CFLAGS` (and `CXXFLAGS`) still get overridden even if `SAGE_DEBUG` is **not** "yes".

Are `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS` used by ECL at all? I don't think so.

CXX is definitely used. I just tried to specify CXX=/path/to/Sun/C++-compiler

and it used the Sun compiler. 

I must admit, I'm not so convinced it is honoring CXXFLAGS, but it would be unwise to not set them. That's really an ECL bug if it ignore the flags.

I just successfully installed ECL (and afterwards Maxima) with `env CXX=/some/nonexistent/cxx ./sage -f ...`.

`configure` tests `CXX`, but it'll only be used if you also build the included GMP, with C++ support, I guess.

Some comments, having spent some time looking at the code others have written. 

### My ECL package

* I don't see anything wrong with the way CXXFLAGS/CFLAGS is handled in the ECL package. It looks OK to me. It might not be 100% necessary, but in general we should set these flags and hope the package follows this. 
----
### Looking at the doc tests:
* **trac_10187_general_display_prefix_workaround.patch** looks OK to me. So I'll positively review that part. 
* **trac_10187_mark_some_doctests_random_until_9880_gets_merged.patch** looks OK to me, So I'll positively review that part. 
*  **maxima-5.22.1.patch** SPKG.txt looks OK, but you will need to find someone that know more about Lisp than me to tell you if that's correct. Ask on sage-devel to get someone who understands it, since I don't. 
* **trac_10187_fix_easy_doctests.patch**

1) There are these numerical results. Has anyone independently verified this are correct?


```
[2.6789385347..., -8.3905259853..., 26.662447494..., -80.683148377...] 
```

On what basis was the number of significant digits selected? 

As a matter of interest, do we know if anyone every verify the original horrid looking symbolic integral is correct? 

I have a dislike for tests where is appears we don't verify the result is correct, but assume it must be. Please justify why those results are correct. That should be in a comment in the code, not displayed. 

2) Why was the doctest:


```
integral(abs(x), x, 0, a)
```

changed to:

```
integral(abs(x)*x, x, 0, a) 
```


It rather strikes me that we should show the example of how to do this calculation in the way Maxima now wants, rather than to simply change the integral to one which gives a simpler answer. 

It so happens that Mathematica 7.0.1 can do the first inegral:


```
In[7]:= Integrate[Abs[x],{x,0,a}]

        a Abs[a]
Out[7]= --------
           2

```


I think it would be better to show the original integral, show the failure. We could even point out how to do the integral in Maxima, and get the hopefully correct result. 
Is rather strikes me that inputting something that was quite reasonable looking does not work. So we should explain why that reasonable thing is wrong, rather than just pick another example. 

The Mathematica documentation often shows a section marked **Possible issues** and would explain problems one might get. Here it seems we should do this, rather than just pick another integral. 

**sage/plot/plot3d/transform.pyx** Do we know if that horrible looking result is correct? I see it is a simple change from the previous horrible looking result, but how do we know if the previous one is correct? If, as I suspect, this has not been verified by hand or with another package, then we should write that fact.

 == Summary == 

* The portability issues appears to have been resolved. 
* Someone needs to check my ECL package
* **trac_10187_general_display_prefix_workaround.patch** is OK
* **trac_10187_mark_some_doctests_random_until_9880_gets_merged.patch**  is OK
* **trac_10187_fix_easy_doctests.patch** Needs explanation. 
* **maxima-5.22.1.patch**  Needs someone to review with a skill set different to me. 

I'm changing to needs work, as some of these tests changes needs explanation. 

Dave

If you change

```sh
if [ "x$SAGE_DEBUG" = xyes ] ; then
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -O0"
   CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -g -O0"
else
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -O2"
   CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -g -O2"
fi
```

to

```sh
if [ "x$SAGE_DEBUG" = xyes ] ; then
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -g -O0"
   CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -g -O0"
else
   CFLAGS="-g -O2 $CFLAGS"
   CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 $CXXFLAGS"
fi
```

and add a comment that neither `CXX` nor `CXXFLAGS` are used within Sage / the way we configure / install ECL, I'm ok with your package.

In the long run, `CFLAG64` and `CXXFLAG64` should be set to their defaults (if empty) in (e.g.) `sage-env`.

You could remove the superfluous

```sh
set +e
```


The comment

```sh
# 'export MAKE='make -j n' where n>1, breaks ECL builds, so unset make
```

isn't up-to-date (since we do no longer `unset MAKE`).


I have no idea what

```sh
# We clear MAKEFLAGS to fix building multiple spkgs in parallel on OS X.
export MAKEFLAGS=
```

is (now) intended to fix; `MAKE="$MAKE -j1"` should be sufficient. If it was really necessary on Darwin, it should only be done on Darwin, since it clears other `MAKEFLAGS` unrelated to parallel builds as well.

The following comment is a bit weird; `ln -sf ...` should do the right thing (without `rm`).

```sh
# Create symbolic link to lib/ecl-version directory.
# This is important when the Sage install is moved.
cd "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/" && rm -f ecl && ln -s ecl-* ecl
```


The following won't work with spaces in `$SAGE_LOCAL` (currently a minor issue):

```sh
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$SAGE_LOCAL/include"
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
```

(We could instead use `--with-gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`, and similar for the Boehm garbage collector...)

Perhaps add a comment to `SPKG.txt` that the *included* Boehm GC is used on MacOS X (only), if this is still the case. (I think it is; ECL used to assume *any* other Boehm GC found on MacOS X must be Fink's broken one, so always used its own there.)

I don't agree with the comment regarding the removal of the GMP source tree; leaving just `install-sh` there is totally safe, without requiring any patch.

I'm ok with the Maxima spkg (IIRC ;-) ).

The preceeding (long) symbolic expression changed in some trivial ways and I added the numerical evaluation to make sure that the old and new symbolic expression are the same.

I'm not the original author. All I know is that it is as correct in the patched doctest as it was before my patch.

The old maxima could not perform the old integral, but the new maxima version can do it. To keep testing the assume facility and maxima error reporting, I made the integral more difficult.

> **sage/plot/plot3d/transform.pyx** Do we know if that horrible looking result is correct? I see it is a simple change from the previous horrible looking result, but how do we know if the previous one is correct? If, as I suspect, this has not been verified by hand or with another package, then we should write that fact.

The old and new maxima actually yield different expressions because of some branch choice issue with the square roots. I'm not the original author, but I think this doctest only shows that maxima doesn't blow up with horrible expressions. I don't think anyone verified the original version. If you want to go through all maxima doctests and annotate them with a manual computation then that is great, but maybe material for a different ticket.

If you comment the doctest, to indicate that the numerical results have not been verified, explaining why, then I;d consider that OK. But I think to stick a test with numerical results, which have not been verified, needs to be noted.

If state the reasons for the numerical results in the doctest then

* I'm happy with everything except the Lisp.

then I think that is all we need tor a positive review.

I've attached a cleanup patch, addressing most of Leif's comments. See  10187-cleanup.patch 

I decided not to restrict the MAKEFLAGS to only OS X, since we don't know for sure it's not needed on other systems, and I don't want to take a chance. 

There appears to be no option to specify the location of the garbidge collector - only whether it is a system one or not. This differs from gmp, where you can specify the location too. 

The package has been updated. MD5 hecksum = `a72f6967736c3d0dd9f69ab34a0cadb7`

I had (*"in principle"*<sup>TM</sup>) already been ok with Dave's ECL package, then he made further changes.

As said before, I consider the "spaces in `SAGE_ROOT`" issue a currently rather minor one (as long as our `spkg-install` doesn't fail in an unexpected manner), since I doubt upstream (at least some other packages) will support that.

However, Dave claimed he had fixed that (with a change that effectively changes nothing ;-) ).
While `echo $CPPFLAGS` will almost always work, running `gcc` with spaces in the include path won't as is. So if at all, I'd change it to

```sh
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I\"$SAGE_LOCAL/include\""
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L\"$SAGE_LOCAL/lib\""
```

which at least `gcc` does support, but not necessarily other parts of `configure` etc.

I cannot guarantee (nor test) the new parameters to `configure` work on all platforms as expected: `--with-system-gmp=yes` is IMHO (at least) superfluous if we also pass `--with-gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`.

----

I'd prefer all error messages (in `spkg-install`) starting with *"Error"* to ease grepping for such, consistent with other packages.

I take your point Leif, you can't check the extra options I added to the configure script. I think they were helpful and safe. Given that, and to stop this ticket dragging on any longer, they are best removed. It's one less thing to worry about. 

If I remove those options to the configured script, **and** implement your changes to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS, it actually break the code, as the Boehm header files are no longer found. (I cut and pasted your changes.) As soon as I undo your changes, so the header files are found. 

Given this, I've made some more changes

* Put CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS back to how they were in the previous ECL package. 
* Removed the options to configure, so they are the same as the previous ECL package
* Corrected the typos. 

If you want to sort out the problem with spaces in the filenames, then edit the ticket and add yourself as an author. But I don't want spend any longer on this.

Yes, with

```sh
CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I\"${SAGE_LOCAL}/include\""
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L\"${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib\""
```

and

```sh
   ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --with-gmp-prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" # --enable-boehm=system
```

`configure` behaves weird (and finally the Lisp build fails for me):

I'd like to see such documented in `SPKG.txt` (*Special Update/Build Instructions*) and / or `spkg-install` (e.g. `# *don't* quote SAGE_LOCAL here, since...`), to avoid others touching this spkg running into the same problem(s).

Clearly there are bugs in `configure`, which might get fixed in future releases though.

Thank you for uploading the Maxima patch again. Perhaps you could explain how one would export one patch containing those 3 changesets, as I don't know how to do that, but have often felt it would be useful. 

OK, hopefully after Leif's Final<sup>TM</sup> testing, this is ready to go, with all the correct library patches and .spkg files now in place. 

At least that's my understanding of the situation. Can anyone else confirm this?

I thought we were in "feature" freeze. ;-)

As mentioned before, positive review from me for both spkgs (and the scripts patch, haven't really looked at the others).

Final test on a slow machine will take hours; I think Jeroen is also going to test on the farm.

I'll report back then.

For the record, here is how to generate a patch for a range of changesets:

```
hg diff -r 19:tip > maxima-5.22.1.patch
```

Applying the resulting patch is equivalent to applying the output of

```
hg export -r 19:tip
```

but the `hg diff` patch is not broken down into the individual changesets.

I hope my installation is somehow broken:

Yes, `make` reverted both ECL and Maxima to the previous versions.

Another `ptestlong` in progress...

Am I right in assuming all these patches are against sage-4.6.1.alpha1 ? 

I just built sage-4.6.1.alpha2, but some of these patches are applied, and some are not. So it looks like I'm going to have to build sage-4.6.1.alpha1. I expect it will take me a couple of hours to build it, patch it, then doctest it

Shouldn't be necessary.

I've previously tested the spkgs and patches successfully (`ptestlong`) multiple times with Sage 4.6.1.alpha2 (in addition with the new MPIR and ECM, #8664 and #5847, respectively) on Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64.

On the 32-bit machine, I so far again got 47 doctest errors with the same though.

Hmmm, maybe a Mercurial issue?

Patches apply apparently clean on vanilla alpha2 as well (with an old Mercurial version), but I also get doctest errors on Ubuntu 9.04 x86_64.

Same with Sage's Mercurial version (1.6.x), i.e. patches apply cleanly.

Now at 199+ doctest errors on the 32-bit machine... :(

I don't think so. I've applied all patches multiple times with `-v` and different Mercurial versions; no rejects, no moved hunks.

One problem I ran into seems to be that when running `make` with `SAGE_UPGRADING=yes` to (safely) install spkgs the Sage library install completely ignores the current branch, and switches back to `sage-main`, such that previously applied patches "vanish".

Another odd thing I discovered is that at least on Ubuntu 9.04, `gcc` run from Sage picks up Sage's MPFR (and GMP/MPIR).

I guess I must have been mistaken - perhaps my alpha2 was not "clean", though I thought I'd extracted a fresh tarball. 

Anyway, several others have got all passes, and I got all passes if I apply this to sage-4.6.1.alpha1. 

I would say I'd try again with sage-4.6.1.alpha2, but it is late here, and I'm not going to start a build now, as you wont get the results until I wake in the morning.
