# Issue 28221: Housekeeping for hypergeometric motives

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28458

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2019-09-06 05:24:46

Keywords: hypergeometric motives

This ticket includes some housekeeping for `sage.modular.hypergeometric_motive.HypergeometricData`.
* Reordered methods into clearer categories (internals, parameters/invariants, operations, L-functions).
* Added some utility methods: `alpha`, `beta`, `hodge_polygon_function`, `hodge_polygon_vertices`.
* We now cache some of the parameters at creation time, to reduce overhead when computing many Euler factors.
* Some simple but effective optimizations to `padic_H_value`. Most significantly, we eliminate redundant calls to `padic_gauss_sum`.

In addition, we make some tweaks to `sage.rings.padics.padic_generic_element.gamma`, including optimizing the working precision.
