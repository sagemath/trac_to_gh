# Issue 10433: Conversion List -> PARI finite field extension element disregards characteristic

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10486

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2010-12-16 16:28:21

Assignee: AlexGhitza

Keywords: finite field pari

Reported by Yannick Neyt in personal communication:


```
sage: k.<a>=GF(3^11)
sage: x = k([1,0,1,1]); x
a^3 + a^2 + 1
sage: x+x+x
3*a^3 + 3*a^2
```


Clearly, we should get zero in the last line, since the characteristic is 3.  The problem is visible in the PARI representation:

```
sage: pari(x)
Mod(a^3 + a^2 + Mod(1, 3), Mod(1, 3)*a^11 + Mod(2, 3)*a^2 + Mod(1, 3))
```
