Our `libgd` is outdated. https://repology.org/project/gd/versions

We make very limited use of `libgd` -- only in `{matrix,vector}_mod2_dense` for pickling matrices. Nevertheless it should be updated. (Why we configure it to use freetype is unclear.)

Unless it is a blocker, the milestone should be 9.4. I am personally holding off putting those tickets to positive review until the release as rebasing will probably be requested. 

Otherwise the ticket is fairly trivial and get rid of patches (yeah!).

I agree that this should be put off to 9.4 since we are deep in the rc stage. However, this LGTM, so off to the buildbots when we look towards 9.4.beta0.
