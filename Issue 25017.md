Keywords: manifold, tensor, submanifold

Given a tensor field _T_ on some differentiable manifold _M_, a differentiable manifold _U_ and a differentiable map _F: U --> M_, this ticket implements the computation of the tensor field _t_ along _U_ with values in _M_ that obeys 

forall _p_ in _U_, _t(p) = T(F(p))_. 

If _F_ is an immersion, _t_ can be viewed as the tensor field _T_ along the immersed submanifold _(U,F)_.

This work is part of the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), see #18528 for an overview.
