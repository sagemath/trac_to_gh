CC:  behackl cheuberg

Make

```
sage: cm.common_parent(GrowthGroup('n^ZZ * log(n)^ZZ * U^n'),
....:                  GrowthGroup('n^QQ * U^n'))
Growth Group n^QQ * log(n)^ZZ * U^n
```

work. (The existing implementation only works in special cases.)

The `merge_sorted` method needs a better, more explicit documentation. The name of the method leads me to believe that something like a MergeSort step is happining. In some sense this is the case, however, it happens in both directions and elements with the same key are kept in the respective list. This should be reflected in the docstring.

Also, please document that the lists are required to have some overlap (w.r.t. the comparison keys) and otherwise raises an error.

The code itself is fine and also the doctests are good. (And of course, the changes in `growth_group_cartesian.py` solve the problem from the description.)

Thank you for the changes, I am fine with the method now.

Conditional `positive_review`; waiting for the patchbot.
