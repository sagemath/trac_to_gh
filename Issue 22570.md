Trying to compile 8.0.beta1 on cygwin64, I get the following error in `libfplll`:

```
libtool: compile:  g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -DFPLLL_DEFAULT_STRATEGY_PATH=\"/home/Sebastien/sage34/sage/local/share/fplll/strategies\" -DFPLLL_DEFAULT_STRATEGY=\"/home/Sebastien/sage34/sage/local/share/fplll/strategies/default.json\" -I./.. -I/home/Sebastien/sage34/sage/local/include/ -I/include -std=gnu++11 -fPIC -I/home/Sebastien/sage34/sage/local/include/ -L/home/Sebastien/sage34/sage/local/lib -O3 -MT enum/enumerate_base.lo -MD -MP -MF enum/.deps/enumerate_base.Tpo -c enum/enumerate_base.cpp  -DDLL_EXPORT -DPIC -o enum/.libs/enumerate_base.o

/tmp/cc6XlJLC.s: Assembler messages:

```

I tried to add `CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -Wa,-mbig-obj"` to `spkg-install`. Then the above file compiles correctly, but the final stage of the compilation (to produce `libfplll.dll.a`) hangs forever.

`@`embray, I am willing to test all the nice patches you have produced for Cygwin. But first I have to get there, which I am unable to do because of this `libfplll` thing...

Is this fixed by #22800?

Duplicate of #22800

By the way, there are also a bug with building ECL on Cygwin 2.8.0 (the latest version).  I haven't made a ticket for that yet but basically we need to add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` manually when compiling ECL (as a workaround).

Also, as a minor status update, a _lot_ of stuff was broken in my most recent build of develop (plus my additional patches).  I mean it built, but a lot of tests were broken.  Which is disheartening because last week I had it down to one test failing and now in just the space of a week the test suite is barely passing at all.

One thing I'm worried about is that on Monday I upgraded my Cygwin install and that could have caused all sorts of issues.  I don't know what package versions I was at before the upgrade though so it might be difficult to reproduce.  I'm trying a build now on a slightly older Cygwin install that I already knew to work for sage 7.4....

My cygwin is recent but not bleeding edge (2.8.0(0.309/5/3)) and I could compile ECL without any problem.

That is the newest version that's been released, I think.  I'm surprised--it didn't work for me without that.

Well, I could compile everything (but the documentation), but Sage does not start:
