Hello Nathann,

Well, still two points that bother me :

* Do we really need to test that q is a prime power ? This is already done by FiniteField itself.

* Do you need to recompute PaleyGraph(9) in your new doctest ?

What do you think ?

Hellooooooooooooooo !!!

Oh, you are right, the graph already exists at this moment, so I should not create it anew ! Patch updated.

About `q` being a prime power or not : you do not "need" to test it, for the code would throw an exception indeed when calling FiniteField, but the message would be less clear for somebody trying to create a PaleyGraph. And nobody is hurt if it stays in the code `:-)`

Well, it applies fine on my version of Sage... Did you also apply all the dependencies of #13058 ?

Anyway some of them will probably have to be rebased before being merged, depending on the order in which Jeroen will pick them.
