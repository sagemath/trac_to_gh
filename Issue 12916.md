Goooooooood to go !!
I added a doctest to your method.. If you agree with this change, can you set the ticket to positive_review ? `:-)`

Thaaaaaaaaaanks !!

Hello Nathann,

Well, still two points that bother me :

* Do we really need to test that q is a prime power ? This is already done by FiniteField itself.

* Do you need to recompute PaleyGraph(9) in your new doctest ?

What do you think ?

Hellooooooooooooooo !!!

Oh, you are right, the graph already exists at this moment, so I should not create it anew ! Patch updated.

About `q` being a prime power or not : you do not "need" to test it, for the code would throw an exception indeed when calling FiniteField, but the message would be less clear for somebody trying to create a PaleyGraph. And nobody is hurt if it stays in the code `:-)`

Hum, this will not work, because I call it capital G and you call it small g...

But what about this strange dependency, without # in front ? I suggest to remove it.

Oh. I added the dependency because there are maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaany patches that got reviewed recently that touch this file, and it would not be very funny to rebase them all `:-D`

Well, too bad, now that the dependency is set, the patch does no longer apply smoothly. I suppose that it needs to be rebased, but I am not able to do that.

? Home come ? I applied it on top of all of them `O_o`

Well, maybe I am wrong.. I am just not happy with the bot turning red..

Well, it applies fine on my version of Sage... Did you also apply all the dependencies of #13058 ?

Anyway some of them will probably have to be rebased before being merged, depending on the order in which Jeroen will pick them.
