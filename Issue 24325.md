> What methods do you think require tests?  These are mostly internal details that are tested implicitly by the existing examples.

Sorry, but I don't understand what "internal details" means. I know we had this discussion before but unless something has changed, virtually all methods should be doctested, e.g., the ones in `_infix_wrapper`. Personally, I have no opinion on whether that's a good or a bad policy (I can see valid arguments on both sides, so I am not sure) but I think it's still the way things work; which could be changed of course.

Btw, with the current state of documentation it is not immediately clear to me what `_infix_wrapper` does. A docstring that explains what this class is doing would be helpful.

It doesn't always make sense to write examples for methods that merely serve some internal purpose and are never used directly--instead the tests use these things indirectly in the process of doing the thing it is they're supposed to do.  What this leads to is tests like you can see in the original code, such as:


```
-        def left_func(self, right):
-            """
-            The function for the operation on the left (e.g., __add__).
-
-            EXAMPLES::
-
-                sage: def dot(a,b): return a.dot_product(b)
-                sage: dot=infix_operator('multiply')(dot)
-                sage: u=vector([1,2,3])
-                sage: v=vector([5,4,3])
-                sage: u *dot* v
-                22
-            """
```


This exact same test is repeated like 3 or 4 times in that module, because someone said "it needs an example block" in every method.  This should be clarified in the developer docs, but that really does not mean "literally every `def` statement".  The intention is that every function or method that someone actually uses directly is documented in this way.

Sometimes it still makes sense to have as an example of how an internal method is used, if it's unclear, or if it's an internal method that might be useful when adding new methods to a class or subclass.  But not if it means going into contortions to set up a test for a method that is never called directly in the first place.

Anyways, this ticket isn't adding particularly new code; just slightly refactoring existing code that was written in an odd way that made it needlessly non-portable.  Needlessly duplicated doctests are also removed.

If it's unclear, `_infix_wrapper` is just a base class for wrappers around a function turning that function into an infix operator.  `infix_operator` itself is just the decorator, but `_infix_wrapper` is the base for the actual wrapped functions returned by the decorator.  

This was already in the original code under just the name "wrapper", and it was a class defined inline in `infix_operator.__call__`.  I just moved it out to module level because there was no-need to create new instances of that base class for every `infix_operator` call.

I don't agree. Also internal methods should be documented that way wherever possible imo.

When I'm not lazy, I try to do an "indirect doctest" when it's too much code to setup the situation where the method could be used or when the method is cleary just a backing for something else, e.g., I'd test `_add_` with `a+b` even though it that calls `__add__`.

Sure, the doctests were bad. I think we should have tried to replace them with better doctests instead of no doctests.

Ok. This wasn't clear to me. That would almost be a valid docstring for the class.

So, I'll stop bugging you here I think as this probably won't lead anywhere. I am afraid I can't set this to positive review as is. If somebody else wants to do that I am not opposed at all.

I'm not sure why you can't.  Do you have some concrete suggestion for how this could be documented better, other than adding pointless repetitive doctests?
