I'd say this is pretty important since without it there's a noticeable, if not mostly aesthetic, regression in the documentation.

I've checked the ticket branch: it fixes the issue. So I am ready to give a 'positive review', all the more that the release of 8.7.rc0 is approaching... If you agree, please set the ticket to 'needs review'.
