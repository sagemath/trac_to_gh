See [this sage-support link](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/_MUj3VFffyA), where https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/curve.html and https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/gallery.html are mentioned.  We should add some of the most relevant of these pictures (or additional ones) to an observable place in the plot documentation - probably both the regular plot doc and as a note (and/or link to the appropriate place in manifolds) in the `plot_slope_field` and `plot_vector_field` places, both 2d and 3d.
