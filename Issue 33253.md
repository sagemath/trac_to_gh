See #33309 for reference. I'm sure this worked at one time. The documentation link from the jupyter notebook is http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/html/en/index.html. At the top of this page there is

```
This is documentation for Sage 9.6.beta4. Documentations in other languages are available `here`.
```
 
where `here` points to `<a href="../../index.html">here</a>` which cannot now be accessed. If `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/index.html` is loaded in a browser then the `here` link is fine. The issue arises when accessing the documentation from the jupyter notebook.

As I mentioned above I'm sure this worked fine when #33309 was merged. I cleaned out the documentation `make doc-clean doc-uninstall` and then `make doc-pdf` to build `html` and `pdf` docs and the issue is still there.

You are right it does now work here. I'm investigation since the link also was not working on sage-on-gentoo. The sage-on-gentoo issue has been corrected. I did nothing to vanilla but maybe there was something with the sage-on-gentoo install that affected the vanilla result. I hopefully will resolve this later today.

No this can't be related to the sage-on-gentoo issue. See https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/683 for reference to document I'm not fantasizing about this. I can't imagine what would have caused this.
