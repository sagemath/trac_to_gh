Assignee: was

CC:  sage-combinat

Keywords: notebook, live documentation

Task: in the static documentation that appears embedded in the
notebook upon, say,

        sage: sage.categories.primer?

add a link to the corresponding live documentation page
(e.g. http://localhost:8000/doc/live/reference/sage/categories/primer.html)

This would be very handy, and make a strong advertisement for the live
documentation (a really cool feature that I had never stumbled upon
until Mike hinted me about it; and apparently, no one at Sage 20 knew
about it either).

Keshav, I still don't understand why this should be positive review if we haven't actually merged a sagenb with it in it.  We would never do that with Maxima or Pari.  I have changed this to "reported upstream, developers acknowledge bug".

This would still be nice to have, not just for the classic SageNB, but also in the Jupyter kernel (if possible), or at least links to doc.sagemath.org if a local copy of the docs is not available.
