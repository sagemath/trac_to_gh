Just a comment:

```
class TermMonoidFactory(UniqueRepresentation, UniqueFactory):
```

has a very strong code smell to me and makes me concerned about memory leaks. Maybe it is all okay, but it is a bit of a departure from normal use.

We have/need a parametrized factory; the desired behavior should be that of both base classes. Where/how do you think the memory leak appears?

IMO, it also feels like the `TermMonoidFactory` is better suited to being a parent that is its just a `UniqueRepresentation` (not to mention all of the ugly doctests). It just is looking quite awkward to me.
