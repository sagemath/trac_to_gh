```
assume(x>-1)
assume(x<1)
arcsin(x)+arccos(x)
```

should, in principle, over the reals, simplify to pi/2 on the interval -1 to 1.  I'm sure numerous problems would result with branches and step functions and whatnot if one actually attempted to implement this ... but in a wishlist world, one can dream!

not sure if this makes dreams come true, but just in case:


```
sage: giac('assume(x>-1 and x<1)')
x
sage: giac('simplify(acos(x)+asin(x))')
1/2*pi
```

Ha, nice!  This can definitely be part of the solution given that giac is apparently now going to be standard?

.. if it makes sense to add interfaces to the simplify function, then i'd be willing to collaborate
