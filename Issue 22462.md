# Issue 22462: simplify arccos+arcsin

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22699

```
assume(x>-1)
assume(x<1)
arcsin(x)+arccos(x)
```

should, in principle, over the reals, simplify to pi/2 on the interval -1 to 1.  I'm sure numerous problems would result with branches and step functions and whatnot if one actually attempted to implement this ... but in a wishlist world, one can dream!

not sure if this makes dreams come true, but just in case:


```
sage: giac('assume(x>-1 and x<1)')
x
sage: giac('simplify(acos(x)+asin(x))')
1/2*pi
```

Ha, nice!  This can definitely be part of the solution given that giac is apparently now going to be standard?

.. if it makes sense to add interfaces to the simplify function, then i'd be willing to collaborate

It may, but that would definitely be a different ticket!  We have had `.simplify()` be just sending to Maxima and back for so long it would make quite the changes in our documentation.  `.simplify_full()` all the more so.  But maybe it is time for that discussion.  rws is currently taking the lead on a lot of this, as you know, so copying him (however, not to suggest this tiny ticket is worth adding giac in that way all by itself).
