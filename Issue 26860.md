The method `_coefficient_fast` serves no purpose at all:

1. It actually makes `__getitem__` slower because of the extra indirection.

2. Special methods in extension classes are very fast already, as fast as a Cython `cdef` function.

3. When called from Python (not Cython), a special method is much faster than a method.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27097

Everything is fine with me except for removing the `__getitem__` from `ModulesWithBasis`. It is used by the elements of `DifferentialWeylAlgebra` (although it is not practically so useful because of the index set of the basis). Moreover, it is something that could be used in the wild by something in `ModulesWithBasis` that is not a subclass of `IndexedFreeModuleElement`. So -1 on removing it.

Removing it doesn't cause any doctest failures (see patchbot). If we keep it, there should at least be one doctest that relies on it (i.e. that would break if we remove this). Could you come up with such a test?

This should do it:

```
sage: W.<x,y,z> = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(QQ)
sage: x[((1,0,0),(0,0,0))]
1
