several comments

**common_neighbors_matrix**

- We could shorten the short description to

```
Return a matrix of numbers of common neighbors between each pairs.
```

  an then add the explanation about `(i, j)` entry

- pep8:

```diff
-        - ``nonedgesonly``-- Boolean (default: `True`); if ``true``, assigns
+        - ``nonedgesonly``-- boolean (default: ``True``); if ``True``, assigns
```


- remove `# add edge`. Not useful

```
            sage: G = Graph([(0,0)],loops=True) # add edges
```


- same here

```
            sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(4) # Check Complete Graph
```


- you must document at the begining of the method that it is working for simple graphs only, and so that neither loops nor multiple edges are accepted. Then instead of this test, you could use:

```
-        if self.has_loops():
-            raise ValueError('Unable to compute simple graph common neighbors for graphs with loops')
+        self._scream_if_not_simple()
```


- this method is defined in `graph.py`, so self is not directed.

- use `vertices = list(self)` but the documentation of the `vertices` parameter says that default in `self.vertices()`.

- `range(0, self.order())`: no need to add 0 -> `range(self.order())`

- we expect the matrix to be symmetric, so 

```diff
-        for v in range(0, self.order()):
-            for w in range(0, self.order()):
-                if v == w:
-                    M[v, w] = 0
-                if nonedgesonly == True:
-                    if A[v, w] > 0:
-                        M[v, w] = 0
+        for v in range(self.order()):
+            M[v, v] = 0
+            for w in range(v + 1, self.order()):
+                if nonedgesonly and A[v, w]:
+                    M[v, w] = M[w, v] = 0
```


**most_common_neighbors**

- ```nonedgesonly`` -- Boolean (default: `True`); if ``True``,` same as above

- `non-adajacent` -> non-adjacent`

- alignment 80 columns

```
+        The common neighbors matrix  for a fan on 6 vertices counting only non-adjacent vertex pairs ::
```


- remove `#Check Complete Graph`

- document that the method is for simple graphs only and add `self._scream_if_not_simple()`

- document that the method is defined for graphs of order `\geq 2` and do

```diff
-            raise ValueError('Unable to find node pairs with common neighbors for graphs with less than 2 nodes')
+            raise ValueError('this method is defined for graphs with at least 2 vertices')
```


- what is `max(max(M)` ?

- The matrix is symmetric, and the current implementation outputs pair (u, v) and (v, u).

    what is max(max(M))
```



Its the maximum value in a 2d matrix.



```
    The matrix is symmetric, and the current implementation outputs pair (u, v) and (v, u).
```

 
no it outputed only (u,v) bcoz second loop started from v.



```
use vertices = list(self) but the documentation of the vertices parameter says that default in self.vertices(). 
```


I have now restored self.vertices in the code. (Or should I do other way round including list(self) in documentation as well as code?

All the changes suggested are commited.

I don't think so

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: A = G.adjacency_matrix()
sage: M = A**2
sage: M
[2 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
[2 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
sage: M[1, 1] = 3
sage: M
[2 0 2 0]
[0 3 0 2]
[2 0 2 0]
[0 2 0 2]
sage: max(max(M))
2
sage: max(M)
(2, 0, 2, 0)
```


`max(M)` returns the "maximum" row according some definition, apparently lexicographic.


use for instance `max(M.coefficients())`


> I have now restored self.vertices in the code. (Or should I do other way round including list(self) in documentation as well as code?

it's consistent with `adjacency_matrix, so it's OK.

almost done ;)


```diff
             for v in range(self.num_verts()):
-                for w in range(v, self.num_verts()):
+                for w in range(v + 1, self.num_verts()):
```


and also, you can do

```diff
-            ValueError: This method is not known to work on graphs with loops. Perhaps this method can be updated to handle them, but in the meantime if you want to use it please disallow loops using allow_loops().
+            ValueError: This method is not known to work on graphs with
+            multiedges. Perhaps this method can be updated to handle them, but
+            in the meantime if you want to use it please disallow multiedges
+            using allow_multiple_edges().
```


and 

```diff
-        The (`i` , `j`) entry of the matrix gives the number of common
+        The `(i , j)` entry of the matrix gives the number of common
```

The milestone is now 8.8. Version 8.7 has been released. The last develop version is 8.7, and the first beta of 8.8 will be shortly released.


- a better code when `nonedgesonly = False`

```diff
-            for w in range(v + 1, self.order()):
-                if nonedgesonly and A[v, w]:
-                    M[v, w] = M[w, v] = 0
+            if nonedgesonly:
+                for w in range(v + 1, self.order()):
+                    if A[v, w]:
+                        M[v, w] = M[w, v] = 0
```


- Add a `.` at the end of `Return vertex pairs with maximal number of common neighbors`

- only 1 empty line before the INPUT block

- Do simple validity test first

```diff
-        verts = list(self)
-        M = self.common_neighbors_matrix(vertices=verts, nonedgesonly=nonedgesonly)
-        if self.num_verts() < 2:
-            raise ValueError('this method is defined for graphs with at least 2 vertices')
+        if self.num_verts() < 2:
+            raise ValueError('this method is defined for graphs with at least 2 vertices')
+        verts = list(self)
+        M = self.common_neighbors_matrix(vertices=verts, nonedgesonly=nonedgesonly)
```
