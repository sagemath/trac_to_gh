The `GroupAlgebraFunctor` is general enough to support algebras over structures that are not groups, such as monoids, so the following should either return None or a functorial construction.

```
sage: A = FreeAbelianMonoid('x,y').algebra(QQ)
sage: A.construction()

In the case of groups this works, but for monoids it does not since `A.group()` is not defined. This ticket fixes that by calling `A.basis().keys()` instead, which is the default implementation of `group()` in `sage.categories.group_algebras`.

The above issue also causes this seemingly unrelated problem for computing 4Ã—4 determinants over `A`.

For smaller matrices this works, as determinants are computed explicitly, but for 4Ã—4 matrices and larger, this involves the computation of the characteristic polynomial. However, `_charpoly_df` is implemented in a way that requires quite complicated coercions, apparently. Therefore, this ticket also adjusts the implementation of `_charpoly_df` to avoid this, by constructing the polynomial from the list of its coefficients.
