Hello everybody !

A poset with embedded linear extension can never be equal to a "simple poset", and users are bound to wonder someday why two apparently equal posets are not detected as such.

With this branch, this:

```
sage: Poset(digraphs.Path(5),linear_extension=True)   
Finite poset containing 5 elements
```


becomes


```
sage: Poset(digraphs.Path(5),linear_extension=True)   
Finite poset containing 5 elements with embedded linear extension
```


So that it is clearer that the Poset is 'not only a poset'.

Sounds good to me, thanks! I would just suggest "distinguished" rather than "embedded", since we use that term in similar situations.

The doctest updates raise the question of whether the use of a poset with a linear extension was voluntary or accidental in a couple places (e.g. in the polyhedra code). But fixing those accidental uses can be in a separate ticket.

Modulo this, and assuming that all tests pass, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Cheers,

Nathann, I thought you knew about accent aigu!  ;-)  (Actually, I live in perpetual fear of forgetting one somewhere important - it must be even more gauche than forgetting an umlaut in German...)
