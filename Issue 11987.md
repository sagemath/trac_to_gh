This ticket implements some more functionality for triangulations:
  * the placing triangulation is a triangulation that can be computed faster than the currently used lexicographic triangulation.
  * the normal cone of a triangulation

A bunch of doctests fail after installing the TOPCOM package, presumably just because of different choices of triangulations.  I can't think of a nice way to deal with that offhand, it would be pretty clunky to force every example to use the Sage-native code.

OK, maybe its not so bad.  Adding in a few more "set_engine('internal')" and "engine='internal'" lines to element.py in geometry/triangulation is enough to fix all the doctest errors.

I imagine that is trivial for Volker to do himself but in case its helpful here is my version that passes the doctests after TOPCOM is installed:
[element.py](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mhampton/element.py)

Apply trac_12159_separate_triangulation_file.patch, trac_12159_placing_triangulation.patch, trac_12159_normal_cone.patch

(for the patchbot)

I have not checked the mathematics of this patch in depth, but it passes all doctests and coverage checks, the documentation looks good, and what I have checked seems correct.  The problems with doctests after TOPCOM is installed have been fixed.  So I am happy to give it a positive review.
