# Issue 29213: Follow up to #21785, use nodoctest instead of .nodoctest

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29450

In #21785 we changed the name of the file used to indicate that a folder shouldn't be doctested from `nodoctest.py` to `.nodoctest`. This stopped the python installation procedure from wanting to byte compile a file that is either empty or only text. Unfortunately, dot file are not included in the glob formula for installation. So, `.nodoctest` is not installed with the other files which is inconvenient for distribution and anyone who want to run doctest against the install rather than the sources.

I finally remembered that I needed to do this. The last month has been somewhat of a tough ride. I decided against testing against `.nodoctest` as well as `nodoctest` and `nodoctest.py` in control.py. Since, hopefully we'll do everything on the same release and `.nodoctest` is not installed, there shouldn't be any issues.

Which glob formula are you referring to?

The one for `package_data` in `setup.py`. The alternative is to try to glob dotfiles as well. I don't think that's worth it.

That bit

```
      package_data = {
          'sage.libs.gap': ['sage.gaprc'],
          'sage.doctest':  ['tests/*'],
          'sage': ['ext_data/*',
