# Issue 17523: Doc fixes in combinat/species/generating_series.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17760

Original creator: darij

Original creation time: 2015-02-10 16:52:52

CC:  agd chapoton mantepse

Keywords: species, documentation

Most of these are fixes I suggested back in #14543 that were split out of that ticket.

What really should be done is adding proper doc to the cycle-index-series/ordinary-generating-series/exponential-generating-series rings, particularly as the conventions used differ from the literature. But I don't see myself as competent enough to do that, so these are just some corrections.

Looks all fine.  Just one very minor thing: I'd use a little x in the docstring of `CycleIndexSeriesRing(R)`. The X just looks very big for no purpose I can see.

Thank you!

Thank you, Martin!

I tend to use capital letters for indeterminates, but it's a matter of personal taste.
