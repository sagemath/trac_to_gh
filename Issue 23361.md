# Issue 23361: __bool__ for free modules

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Define that a module (or vector space) is `True` iff it is not the zero space. In other words:

```
sage: bool(QQ^0)
False
sage: bool(QQ^1)
True
```


This could be useful in constructions like

```
if M.right_kernel():
    ...
```

+1, and this also makes sense at the category level.

Due to the crazy category `__getattr__` stuff, I don't think that special methods can be implemented in categories.

If the base ring is the zero ring (obtained by `Integers(1)`, for example), then any free module should return `False`. Certainly this should be the case if you want to set `__nonzero__ = __bool__`.

Should `bool(Integers(1))` return `True` or `False`? In any case, maybe just use `self.base_ring().is_zero()`. (I tried constructing zero rings in a few different ways, and this worked for all of them.)

Sorry, my comment wasn't clear. I meant mathematically (in the sense of the categorification of non-negative integers), not as code.

I'm not convinced. I define `__bool__` to mean "has positive dimension", which is more useful than "contains a non-zero element". Checking for the base ring seems like useless nitpicking to me.

Of course, there is some friction between the programming aspect and the mathematical aspect here. It's not clear to me whether "rank" is even well-defined (at least, it is not true that R<sup>k</sup> has rank k if R is the zero ring). From a programming point of view, the rank is perfectly well-defined as whatever the `rank()` method returns.

`__nonzero__` and `__bool__` are the same thing. It's just that `__nonzero__` is the Python 2 name and `__bool__` is the Python 3 name. But they serve the same purpose, namely to convert something to a boolean. Whenever Python sees `bool(obj)` or `if obj:`, that method is called.

I disagree with the following, from the mathematical point of view:

```
sage: R = Integers(1)
sage: M2 = R**2
sage: M3 = R**3
sage: M3 == M2
False
```

Every free module over the zero ring should be zero (hence equal to every other free module), since it only has one element, 0. So I agree that mathematically, rank is not defined. I think the Sage code should actually reflect this: probably `M2.rank()` should raise an error.

I don't anticipate using the zero ring any time soon, but other users may, so we should deal with it properly. I'm not asking that you fix the fact that ranks have meaning for these modules, but I don't think you should compound it by making `R**2` nonzero even though, mathematically, it is zero.

Maybe, but I consider this outside of the scope of this ticket.

I'm not making `R**2` nonzero, I am just saying that it is `True` in a boolean context.

As I said later in that comment.

When I dealt with the initial implementation of simplicial complexes, I had to deal with a number of bugs involving `0 x n` or `n x 0` matrices. I feel like the same thing is going to happen here: someone is going to start producing free modules over the zero ring and expect `M == 0` to return `True` for them, or `bool(M)` to return `False`, and it won't.

You say that this is "useless nitpicking", but I don't understand the resistance to the small change from

```
return bool(self.rank())
```

to something like

```
return not self.ring().is_zero() and bool(self.rank())
```

Are you worried about speed? Or something else?

I simply don't argee that `Integers(1)^4` should be considered `False`.

The problem is that we are considering two different definitions of `bool(M)` here:

1. (math) a free module M is `True` if and only if M contains a non-zero element.

2. (comp sci) a free module M is `True` if and only if the rank of M is positive.

I consider the second definition more useful and simpler.

Simpler because it requires checking just one condition. And whenever I see two ways to do something and the difference in behaviour is very small, I almost always go for the simplest solution. If you want to add extra complexity like checking for the zero ring, there needs to be a good reason.

Also more useful because I consider it a _feature_ that `Integers(1)^0` and `Integers(1)^3` are different (contrary to your earlier comment about `==`). So treating them differently in `bool()` increases the information content of `bool(M)`.

I'm not going to argue about it any more, so if you want to proceed, that's fine. But I don't think that rank should be defined for (free) modules over the zero ring, and instead it should probably raise an error (or always be zero?). If anyone ever implements raising an error in this situation, then with your proposal, `bool(M)` will be broken for such modules.

So I think you should at least add some doctests for free modules over the zero ring, so if the behavior later changes, it will be caught, and also so the current behavior is documented.
