Here is a patch for flint-1.5.2, which only modifies what gets built on ARM 32-bits.

I can confirm that with that change, flint-1.5.2 builds -- and all tests end up ok.

The issue has been discussed upstream ; they're ok with a sage-only patch, since they're focusing on flint2.

I built my own spkg by :

* taking the current flint spkg ;

* putting the 1.5.2 version of flint in src/ instead of the current 1.5.0 ;

* copying src/longlong.h to patches/

* copying the attached patch to patches/

* applying it to the patches/longlong.h

In spkg-install, I also added two lines :

# Patched longlong.h doesn't produce invalid assembly on 32-bit ARM

cp patches/longlong.h src/

Then I packed it into flint-1.5.2.p1.spkg, and put it in ~/sage/spkg/standard/ ; removing the current flint spkg.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10328

I'm intending to upgrade Sage's FLINT to 1.5.2 at #9858, because of #8664, to be hopefully merged into (an early alpha of) Sage 4.6.2.

Note that the spkg needs clean-up I'll do there as well. (I already did some stuff, until black-out... :/ )


Btw, FLINT 1.6 is on the way, too.

The *Author(s)* field should contain realnames; please also add yourself to http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames .

In general you should provide a proper Mercurial patch to the spkg (along with a link to the updated spkg), but I can include your changes in my spkg.

FLINT 1.6 was released on/for Chrismas (Dec. 24th).

Unless somebody else already did/does I'll open a ticket to upgrade Sage's version to that one.

Since Sage currently does weird things with the Makefile, providing a new, "clean" spkg will take some time (besides testing collaboration with the new FLINT of course).

(Though FLINT is a **plain C** library, with a **separate** module to interface with NTL, which is C++ and hence the interface as well, Sage builds one monolithic "FLINT" library with that interface module included such that it always depends on the NTL library and the C++ standard library, which is totally odd and frequently causes trouble. Changing that requires changes to the *Sage library*, including `module_list.py` and perhaps `setup.py`, too.)

I can confirm that it also builds on AC100, ubuntu 11.10.
I will be willing to give it positive review once I am done building and testing Sage.
