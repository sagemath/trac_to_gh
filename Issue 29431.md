# Issue 29431: map_coefficients for Laurent polynomials

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29668

Original creator: kedlaya

Original creation time: 2020-05-08 18:10:18

Keywords: Laurent polynomials

Currently elements of a polynomial ring have a method `map_coefficients` to apply a callable function to the coefficients, but Laurent polynomials do not. This ticket adds such a method.

This is a straightforward port of the correspond method from ordinary polynomial. I put in in the common base class of univariate and multivariate Laurent polynomials.
