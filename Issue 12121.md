# Issue 12121: Graph(n) is not documented

the syntax `Graph(n)`, which apparently creates a graph with n
vertices 0, 1, ..., n-1 and no edge, is not documented.

At first I thought this might have been unintended.  But 

```

        if format is None and isinstance(data, (int, Integer)):
            format = 'int'
        if format is None and data is None:
            format = 'int'
            data = 0
```

so apparently it is intentional.

There _is_

```

       One can very easily create a graph in Sage by typing:
    
          sage: g = Graph()
    
       By typing the name of the graph, one can get some basic information
       about it:
    
          sage: g
          Graph on 0 vertices
```

but that is not really documentation.  Good find.

Changing keywords from "sd35.5" to "sd35.5, sd40.5".

Nice work. Positive review.

The change from "nodes" to "vertices" is fine. Still positive review.

This needs to be rebased to sage-5.1.beta1.  Keep in mind that #12874 and #12810 also touch `graphs.py` (I haven't checked whether these conflict with this patch).

Apply only trac_12293_document_graph_int_format_v3.patch . The v3 patch applies to 5.1.beta2.
