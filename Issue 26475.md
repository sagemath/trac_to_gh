# Issue 26475: avoid .vertices() in independent_sets.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26712

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2018-11-18 09:04:10

CC:  tscrim chapoton

Keywords: py3, graph

With #26566, we can now provide a mapping to `dense_graph_init`, so we do it. We thus remove the last call to `.vertices()` from this file.

We also perform an extra round of PEP8 cleaning.

Due to a mistake with git in #26711, I had to redo the commits... Hope it's OK now.

This ticket changes the internal mapping vertex to integer in the class `IndependentSets` (replace `.vertices` with `list(G)`). This modifies the output order in some doctests of `posets.py`, but the solutions are the same.

I have updated the doctests in `posets.py`.
