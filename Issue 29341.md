```
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py", line 91, in sage.symbolic.integration.external.mma_free_integrator
Failed example:
    integral(sin(y)^2, y, algorithm='mathematica_free') # optional - internet
Expected:
    1/2*y - 1/4*sin(2*y)
Got:
    -1/2*cos(y)*sin(y) + 1/2*y
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   7 in sage.symbolic.integration.external.mma_free_integrator
    8 fricas tests not run
