# Issue 14333: Composition of morphisms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tfeulner

Assignee: nthiery

Keywords: composition, morphisms

The following code leads to a TypeError


```
sage: F.<a> = GF(4)
sage: x = F.Hom(F).identity()
sage: z = F.hom([a])
sage: a = (z*x)
sage: x*a
```


The question is could these type checking be relaxed in categories.morphism.IdentityMorphism.
