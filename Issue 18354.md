With the new routine:

```
sage: A =MatrixSpace(GF(2), 500, 1000).random_element()
sage: M = Matroid(A)
sage: timeit("M.components()")
625 loops, best of 3: 244 Âµs per loop
```

Forcing the use of the old routine:

```
sage: timeit("sage.matroids.matroid.Matroid.components(M)")
5 loops, best of 3: 52.2 ms per loop
```

All tests passed. 
The behavior also matches with the original for all matroids of at most 9 elements.
