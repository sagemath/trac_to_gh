Groups created from graph automorphisms start numbering at zero, but Gap doesn't, so we get nasty behavior like this:

```
sage: G1=Graph(':H`ECw@HGXGAGUG`e');G=G1.automorphism_group();sg=G.subgroups()
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [(0,7)(1,4)(2,3)(6,8)]
sage: [s for s in sg]
[Permutation Group with generators [()],
 Permutation Group with generators [(1,8)(2,5)(3,4)(7,9)]]
```


This originated at [this sage-support thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/Lvft5VA7rFg).
The root of the problem is

```
sage: G._gap_()
Group( [ (1,8)(2,5)(3,4)(7,9) ] )
```

The subgroup method command was designed to handle this.

Deleting comment because I still don't know quite how to use the branch view - why is only one of the commits on this branch showing up in the comments?

I like this, and I think that maybe it's even better that the subgroups are now shown *as subgroups* - what do others think?  (Rob, e.g., as the author?)
