Actually it would be better to first implement #19040 somehow, even with suboptimal Pynac decision functionality, in order to have the right interface first---with all necessary changes to doctests.

EDIT: It might be even better to revert the logic changes and do a Pynac release without them, but plus some fixes and enhancements.
