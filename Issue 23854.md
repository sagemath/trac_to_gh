```
In this example we construct a point of order 2 which thinks its order is infinity:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,-2])
sage: E.torsion_order()
1
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3-2)
sage: P = E.lift_x(a)
sage: P.order()
+Infinity
sage: 2*P
(0 : 1 : 0)
```

It's fine if we construct the point differently:

```
sage: EK = E.change_ring(K)
sage: P = EK([a,0])
sage: P.order()
2
```

and arises since in the first construction P.curve() is the curve over QQ, not the extension.  Hence the error is in the lift_x() function.  Which means that it is probably my fault since I think I wrote that.

What happens is that the code correctly computes the y-coordinate (in the example it is 0 ) and then constructs the points using self.point(coords, check=False).  Switching off the check is to save time testing that the corordinates satisfy the equation of the curve.  But we should check that the x-coordinate given lies in the base field of the curve.

In the example it would be better if an error was raised; to construct this point the user should first construct the base-change of E from QQ to K and then construct the point on that.

I can easily fix this by adding lines of the form

```
       K = self.base_ring()
        try:
            x = K(x)
        except TypeError:
            raise TypeError('x must be coercible into the base ring of the curve')
```

but then 2 tests fail since the tests include a couple where the x supplied is in an extension of the base field.  However these examples, such as 

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a');
sage: P = E.lift_x(pAdicField(17, 5)(6))
```

are bad since the resulting point has the wrong parent:

```
sage: P.parent()
Abelian group of points on Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x over Rational Field
```


A good way to fix this would be to allow the user to give an x which lies in some extension, tested by checking (if the x=K(x) fails) that E1 = E.change_ring(x.parent()) works and if so running lift_x() there, giving the same point as before but with the correct parent.  Note that the problem arises in the first place since the point returned is constructed with check=False.

If this is deemed to be useful (as I think it is), should we make it automatic, or require an additional parameter extend=False and only do the base-change when it is set to True?  This could be misleading since we must distinguish between cases where a base-change is needed to include x, and one where the y-coordinate is in a further extension.  So it's really a 3-way division: extend=False could result in failure unless both the given x and the computed y are in the original base_ring K;  extend='x' allows any x with parent L such that self.change_ring(L) is possible and returns a point over L provided that the y coordinate is also in L; and extend='xy' would be like extend='x' except that a further base-change would be made to include the y-coordinates.  Actually there's a 4th case extend='y' where we require x in the base ring but will make a quadratic extension if necessary to include the y-coordinates.

I am beginning to think that we should leave the lift_x() as it is (with the stricter test that x=K(x) works, and removing the two subsequently failing tests) and add a new method with these 4 options.

A couple comments:

* I think the right condition to check is what you have in the code: that there is a coercion from `K` to `L`.  But it's not what you describe in the documentation: that `x` is converted into the base ring.  The difference occurs for p-adics for example:


```
sage: a = Qp(5)(82748127); a
2 + 2*5^4 + 4*5^5 + 4*5^7 + 5^8 + 2*5^9 + 3*5^10 + 5^11 + O(5^20)
sage: QQ(a)
-639974/5762513
```


* When there is an extension, the right ring should probably be the pushout of the parent of `x` and the base ring of the curve.

Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with these changes.

Thanks for looking at this.  I can correct the docstring.

I did think of pushouts but decided that was overkill, though at present this fails:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,0,2])
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: E.lift_x(x, extend='xy')
...
TypeError: Unable to base-change from Rational Field to Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```


After more thought I was also wondering whether it would not be simpler to to the x-extension always and let the extend parameter just be True or False and control whether or not to make the quadratic extension to include the y-coordinate where necessary.  That way you could give any reasonable x with no additional stuff and get a point defined over an extension (assuming that the y-coordinate exists in the pushout of the base ring and x's parent).

I'll try out the pushout idea anyway, making sure that everything still works, only using the pushout construction when sef.base_ring() and x.parent() are different.
