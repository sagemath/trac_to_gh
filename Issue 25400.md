# Issue 25400: deprecate module combinat.partition_algebra

After #25162, it seems that the content of `partition_algebra.py` is no longer needed, but when looking for partition algebras, one may be misled that this is what's implemented (also because of http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.html)

It is not clear to me whether we can simply remove this, or whether the classes should be deprecated, or somehow recycled.

For example:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
sage: da.PartitionDiagrams(3/2)
Partition diagrams of order 3/2
sage: _.list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2)
Set partitions of {1, ..., 2, -1, ..., -2} with 2 and -2 in the same block
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2).list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
```

I think that this is probably a good idea.   To deprecate we will need to ensure that there are equivalent function calls for all of these diagram classes and methods (I believe that most of them, but not all, are in `diagram_algebra.py`).

Do we need to keep/deprecate the classes

```
class SetPartitionsXkElement(SetPartition):
```

and

```
class SetPartitionsAk_k(SetPartitions_set):
class SetPartitionsAkhalf_k(SetPartitions_set):
```

etc., and

```
class PartitionAlgebraElement_generic(CombinatorialAlgebraElement):
class PartitionAlgebraElement_ak(PartitionAlgebraElement_generic):
```

etc.?

They do not appear in any doctests, and look rather "private".

I want to add the doctests all to `diagram_algebras.py` though, because they are quite good!

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Once #25662 is in, I will move those doctests which are useful into `diagram_algebras.py`

All of those functions you are also removing you should also deprecate because even though they are not imported, they are part of the public documentation (so people may import them in the wild).

OK, will continue to work on this once #25662 is reviewed.
