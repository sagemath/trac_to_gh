After #25162, it seems that the content of `partition_algebra.py` is no longer needed, but when looking for partition algebras, one may be misled that this is what's implemented (also because of http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/combinat/partition_algebra.html)

It is not clear to me whether we can simply remove this, or whether the classes should be deprecated, or somehow recycled.

For example:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.diagram_algebras as da
sage: da.PartitionDiagrams(3/2)
Partition diagrams of order 3/2
sage: _.list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2)
Set partitions of {1, ..., 2, -1, ..., -2} with 2 and -2 in the same block
sage: SetPartitionsAk(3/2).list()
[{{-2, -1, 1, 2}},
 {{-2, 1, 2}, {-1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}},
 {{-2, -1, 2}, {1}},
 {{-2, 2}, {-1}, {1}}]
```

I think that this is probably a good idea.   To deprecate we will need to ensure that there are equivalent function calls for all of these diagram classes and methods (I believe that most of them, but not all, are in `diagram_algebra.py`).

Do we need to keep/deprecate the classes

```
class SetPartitionsXkElement(SetPartition):
```

and

```
class SetPartitionsAk_k(SetPartitions_set):
class SetPartitionsAkhalf_k(SetPartitions_set):
```

etc., and

```
class PartitionAlgebraElement_generic(CombinatorialAlgebraElement):
class PartitionAlgebraElement_ak(PartitionAlgebraElement_generic):
```

etc.?

They do not appear in any doctests, and look rather "private".

I want to add the doctests all to `diagram_algebras.py` though, because they are quite good!
