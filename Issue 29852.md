The `conjugate` leads to some inconsistencies with the parent depending on if the partition is empty or not. I would instead do it like this:

```python
        if not self:
            par = Partitions_n(0)
            return par.element_class(par, [])
        par = Partitions_n(sum(self))
        return par.element_class(par, conjugate(self))
```


I think it is also time to move the `conjugate` function to the `combinat_cython.pyx` file.

Thank you. Since it is imported into the file, I think you can then import it from that module. So I don't think a deprecation is necessary.
