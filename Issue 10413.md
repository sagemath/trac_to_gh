Keywords: graphics_array matrix_plot ticks axes

I wrote a worksheet that demonstrates a number of problems with `graphics_array` and `matrix_plot`:

https://sagenb.kaist.ac.kr:8066/home/pub/22/

Briefly, when using `graphics_array` on `matrix_plot` objects:

* axes are not drawn correctly,
* ticks options do not work well,
* the rightmost object (in a single row) is drawn a bit smaller than other objects -- I think extra axes_pad is put into that image.

Graphics arrays definitely need to be overhauled.  There are some [very nice features](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/whats_new.html#sophisticated-subplot-grid-layout) that recently were added to matplotlib (in 1.0.0, now in Sage) that will make very nice graphics arrays.  There is a sage-devel message somewhere about this (someone was asking about rewriting graphics arrays a couple of months ago, IIRC).

Actually, the subplots feature (listed right below the feature I mentioned above) is probably the easiest to use in making a graphics_array.
