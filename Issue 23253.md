CC:  @fchapoton @tscrim

The method `__contains__` of alternating sign matrices is wrong

```
sage: A = AlternatingSignMatrices(3)
sage: A.cardinality()
7
sage: M = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3)
sage: from itertools import product
sage: sum(1 for p in product([-1,0,1], repeat=9) if p in A)
9
```
Indeed the matrix

```
0  1 0
0  1 0
1 -1 1
```
is not an asm.

We also add more checking and make a much faster conversion from monotone triangles.

The current definition is correct. Alternating in sign and sum=1 implies that the first and last must be 1.

The `check` is ignored in the `_element_constructor_`.

It is better to have the more standard `assert m not in A`.

Otherwise LGTM.
