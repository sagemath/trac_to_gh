Keywords: rank code

To perform the GRS attack described by Gaborit et al. in "On the complexity of the rank syndrome decoding problem", functionalities need to be added to `AbstractLinearRankMetricCode` to:
- Find an error vector of a certain rank.
- Apply the canonical projection to a element in the extended field.
- Find a subspace of the extended field of given dimension.
- Apply the GRS algorithm.
