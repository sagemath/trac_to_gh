The following scripts have a shebang and should be chmoded to 755: 

- `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin/sage-arch-env`

The following image should be chmoded to 644

I removed the files

They are still two missing pkg scripts:

Concerning `dev` scripts, there is no evidence that anyone use them, but it seems that the policy is to keep them deprecated and untouched for a while (while removing from the doc):
