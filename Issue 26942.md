# Issue 26942: py3: fix doctest in generic_graph (part 2) -- cycle_basis

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27179

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-31 10:19:53

Keywords: py3, graph

Some difficulties are that 1) the method of `networkx` that we use can either return cycle `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0]` or cycle `[0, 3, 2, 1, 0]`, and 2) the cycle basis is not unique. So we mark doctests as py3 or py3.
