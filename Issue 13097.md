# Issue 13097: Maxima indeterminate limit result is not converted to Sage

Keywords: ind indeterminate maxima

User 'Mathemage' reports

```
sage: bool( lim(sin(x), x=oo) == ind)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

NameError: name 'ind' is not defined
```

and indeed although Maxima outputs this for similar limits, we do not have a conversion.  

What the heck would we do with it, anyway?  Does any other Sage subsystem have such an element?  Does Maxima even have it, or just print it?  Anyway, worth exploring.

Changing keywords from "ind indeterminate maxima" to "ind indeterminate maxima limit".
