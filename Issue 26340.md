I am not sure I agree with the changes to `iterators_*_nbrs`. I generally agree that the notion should be self-explanatory to those that know what I digraph is. I think we should at least have something in those function docs giving a precise definition (although it does not have to be the 1-line description).

In Cython, you can (and should) use `dict_obj.iteritems()` rather than `iteritems(dict_obj)` as Cython is different than Python.

Nitpick: `degree of `v`` is over-indented.

LGTM beyond that.
