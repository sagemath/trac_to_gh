# Issue 19265: Octave script that doesn't run

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19502

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/30334/runs-in-octave-tested-but-not-sagemathcloud-errors/).  Apparently the Octave code below doesn't run with `octave.eval()`, or at least hangs or something.


```
# a)

function y=f(x)  
    y=3/(2+x)
endfunction

function a=p(x)  
    y1=x^2
    y2=x
    y3=1
    a=[y1,y2,y3]
endfunction

# b)

# Stützstellen vector x

x=[-1 0 1]
f(x(1))
f(x(2))
f(x(3))

# Anzahl der Stützstellen bestimmer

d=length(x)
A=zeros(d,d)

for i=1:3
    A(i,:)=p(x(i))
endfor

b=zeros(3,1)

for i=1:3
    b(i)=f(x(i))
endfor

b
[L,U,P] = lu(A)
invL=inv(L)
y=invL*P*b
invU=inv(U)
z=invU*y
A*z
b
```
