Do you mean that `R.lagrange_polynomial()` should potentially return an element of a different ring than `R`?  That would be unnecessarily confusing in my opinion.

1.42500000000000*x^2 - 5.82500000000000*x + 6.15000000000000

You can either catch that and raise an exception (which is probably the mathematically strictly correct), or be more flexible and allow situations like the previous (which, i think, can be useful in several cases).

Actually, with this branch, you get

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: R.lagrange_polynomial(((1,1.75),(2,0.2),(3,1.5)))
57/40*x^2 - 233/40*x + 123/20
```

This is not ideal from my point of view (I would prefer to use `coerce` to put the coefficients into the base field of `R`, so this example would raise an error), but a doctest in a published book unfortunately depends on it.

Hello,

On sage-6.5 at least, I got the right answer.

```
sage: R.<x>=GF(101)[]

It would be cool to add it to the documentation since it was the initial purpose of the ticket.

Thanks for pointing the example! Once again the symbolic ring is wrong

```
sage: f(x) = 4 * sin(x) - exp(x) / 2 + 1
sage: f(1.2)
3.06809788250063
sage: parent(_)
Symbolic Ring
```

Parent should be `RR` as it is already the case for

```
sage: parent(exp(1.2))
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: parent(sin(1.2))
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

But

```
sage: f(x) = x
sage: parent(f(1.2))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

If I understand #18092 correctly, it will only make `f.evaluate(x=1.2)` return an element of `RR`, while `f(1.2)` will remain a symbolic expression.  Hence I think #18092 would not automatically (transparently) solve this issue.

I thought that `.evaluate` would be a modification of `.subs`!! With functions, this behavior would be **wrong**. It should be what it has to be

```
sage: f(x) = 2*x
sage: f.subs(x=3)
x |--> 6
```

In other words `f.evaluate(x=3)` should be a constant function!

Perfect!
