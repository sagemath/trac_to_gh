# Issue 26947: py3: fix doctests in generic_graph (part 6) -- graphviz_string

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27184

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-01-31 13:50:40

Keywords: py3, graph

Fix doctests in
- `_keys_for_vertices`: one doctest is fixed adding a `...`. The other is fixed by removing the call to `.vertices()` in the method (his is safe for the result of `graphviz_string`.
- `graphviz_string`: we change the failing doctest by something more stable when marked `py3` (again an issue of ordering of vertices and edges)
