# Issue 15480: Add some sig_on() in Singular library

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This hangs (see #15710) and cannot be interrupted:

```
sage: F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
```


The attached branch fixes the "cannot be interrupted" part of the bug.

Thanks, I just tested it and this works. But, we don't need #14333. I just cherry-picked the last commit on to develop and the interrupt worked very well. :)

Sure, but I started #15710 by checking whether #14333 would fix it and any fix for #15710 would probably need to be based on #14333. And I just copied that commit here. Given that #14333 has positive review, it's not a problem, right?

Yeah. I guess it shouldn't matter.
