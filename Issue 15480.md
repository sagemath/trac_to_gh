CC:  @ppurka

This hangs (see #15710) and cannot be interrupted:

```
sage: F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
```


The attached branch fixes the "cannot be interrupted" part of the bug.

Thanks, I just tested it and this works. But, we don't need #14333. I just cherry-picked the last commit on to develop and the interrupt worked very well. :)
