Thanks for this! I'm a bit confused by the default `side` argument on line 72. I see that it defaults to `side='left'`, but based on the description, it seems like `side='right'` might be "mathematical default." Does this make sense or am I missing something?

Hi, it is indeed a little confusing. The "mathematical default" is indeed `side='right'`, which corresponds to _left-multiplication_. The reason being that sage's ``side`` is the side of the vector relative to the matrix, whereas in mathematics we almost always refer to the side of the matrix relative to the vector. 

The `side` argument already existed in the `MatrixMorphism.matrix` method, with this choice of left/right. The methods left_kernel/right_kernel, left_eigenspaces/right_eigenspaces also work with that convention. 


Now the small problem that remains is that the default is `side="left"`, but the way some methods are coded are done the other way and taking the transpose. For instance, `matrix.kernel` takes the transpose and calls the `right_kernel` method, which feels a little off. After this ticket, methods of MatrixMorphism will call the appropriate one.

I realise this text might sound confusing, that's because it is somewhat confusing.

The build error doesn't seem to be from the changes in this ticket.
