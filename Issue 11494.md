Keywords: MPFR spkg wishlist

Our current MPFR spkg is fairly old (based on MPFR 2.4.2), and upgrading it to the latest [stable] upstream release is now on the ["high-priority wishlist"](http://wiki.sagemath.org/days32/wishlist).

`spkg-install` also needs a major rewrite, e.g. to make use of (some of) GMP's / MPIR's build flags.

I think I'll provide a new spkg in the next days (weekend, say).

MPFR 3.0.1 was released on April 4th 2011; there are already some [additional upstream patches](http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/allpatches) for that version; see http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/ .

The second release candidate is out:

 [...] The main changes since this first release candidate are:
 
- Fixed `--enable-gmp-internals`.
- Handle the special cases in `mpfr_cmp_q()` and `mpfr_cmp_f()` (fixing the problem with the `erange` flag in particular).
- Added `mpfr_buildopt_gmpinternals_p()` function.
- MPFR manual update and minor corrections.

 Here's a second release candidate. As there should not be new platform-specific problems, the final release is delayed by a few days only.

This version of MPFI should work with both versions of MPFR.  However, the old version of MPFI will not work with the new version of MPFI.

I haven't tested it on a 32bit OS.  This was primarily just so we could build flint2 in Sage.

I wonder why comment [comment:8] speaks about MPFI. Also, upstream (MPFR) we have seen several
problems with the `--enable-thread-safe` option which is now enabled by default. Unless needed
for Sage, my advice would be to configure MPFR with `--disable-thread-safe`.

I spoke about mpfi because this ticket is marked as depending on #12171 which is upgrading mpfi. My understanding of the dependency field is that it means that you need #12171 for this ticket. This is silly and should be the other way around.

I think comment 9 has not been written with a clear mind. 

I asked about test on 32bit machine because of this [ https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/13].

* It sets some CFLAGS and others itself, is it needed? does not mpfr look for the gmp header and pumps from there if possible? and should we take advantage of this (as in done for mpir where spkg-install look at what mpir chooses if CFLAGS et al. are empty)?

> It sets some CFLAGS and others itself, is it needed? 


as a developer of MPFR I strongly recommend to let MPFR choose the same CC and CFLAGS as GMP
(they are read in gmp.h). Since we do this for MPFR, this greatly improved the portability of
MPFR on different platforms with different compilers, in particuler it solves the ABI=32 vs ABI=64
issues.

> Is the patch for Solaris stuff still needed?


I guess yes, since this was a bug in the Solaris kernel.

I've put an updated package implementing my remarks, mainly using the mpir spkg-install file, I've also updated the description and license info.

It can be found at

http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/sage/mpfr-3.1.0.spkg

It seems to do what it should, and uccessfully built and rand MPFR test suite on a "usual" intel 64 bit system, not any idea if I broke anything for more exotic architectures. Did not ran sage test suite either.

I'm pretty sure that's a relict from when people didn't know how to properly disable *parallel* `make`.  If in doubt, use `$MAKE -j1 install` etc.

Since MPFI depends on MPFR (and MPIR), you have to rebuild MPFI after upgrading one of the latter.

If you have enough time (and/or the machine is fast enough), you can copy new/updated spkgs into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/` and run

```sh
$ env SAGE_UPGRADING=yes make build
```
afterwards.  That way all dependent packages automatically get rebuilt, which can take some time.

(Unfortunately there are also a couple of stupid transitive dependencies; e.g. ATLAS gets rebuilt if you update readline -- just because ATLAS now has an `spkg-install` file written in Python, and Python depends on readline...  So a lot of rebuilds performed by `make` aren't really necessary.)

the failures are most likely due to the fact that the `mpfr_urandom` and `mpfr_urandomb`
return identical values on processors with different word size in MPFR 3.1.0
(see http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.1.0/#changes).

The bad news is that this will need changing the doctests.

The good news is that we won't need any more different doctests on 32-bit and 64-bit
(assuming the MPIR random generator is independent of the word size).

I'll have a look at them tomorrow.

Some of them at least are just changes in random output (e. g. real_mpfr and real_mpfi)

Maybe because I did not rebuild Pari spkg?

Apart from running sage -b I just forced rebuild of libfplll before the above make ptest (because of lack of time).

I'll properly rebuild everything tomorrow and rerun the testsuite.

My last failures happen in the same files as what you posted some time ago and are always involving some random function.

As you posted later, this should be because MPFR changed its behavior.

I'll post a patch fixing the doctest, but cannot test it on a 32 bits computer (nor exotic architectures), so I'll leave that to someone else.

The question is whether this change of behavior is actually a problem ?

If someone saved old stuff with a given random seed, or something like that, its results will not be reproducible... I do not really feel concerned about that.

If someone could also test the spkg on sunos, solaris, apple or other exotic oses/cpus combinations, that would be more than welcome.

should I rename new packages with the old name? Or keep the new name?
For example Sage 4.8 contains `mpfi-1.3.4-cvs20071125.p9.spkg`. Should I put
`mpfi-1.5.1.spkg` aside this one, or rename it?

I've had a look at the random MPFR real number generation code and there was indeed a "hack" for 32 bits systems before which requested more bits (31 from randstate doc, although real_mpfr says 32) from MPIR to get an equivalent MPFR behavior. Although, if I force sage to do the same on my 64 bits system (just adding a call to rstate.c_random() unconditionally in real_mpfr), I do not get what 32 bits (and 64 bits) systems used to return (nor what my 64 bits system now return which was to expect).

Paul, I'm confused by your last message. By vanilla 4.8, do you mean vanilla+this ticket and dependencies? If that's the case, and I somehow understand correctly the random generation stuff of MPIR and MPFR which should both be hardware independent now, the change I made above should give me a similar behavior as you on a 32 bits system and get no doctest failures.

For example the last failing test in real_mpfr used to give

```
0.979095507956490

```
With this ticket and dependencies, I get (on all of my 64 systems)

```

no, I just meant vanilla 4.8. This was just to make sure that potential failing doctests did not fail before this patch.

Now with #12171 all doctests still pass (with one timeout even with `-long`,
for a test taking more than half an hour).

I'll now try with this spkg.

this is expected. If you add the call to `rstate.c_random()` unconditionally,
then on 64-bit systems you will draw 64 extra random bits when the precision mod 64 is between 1 and 32, whereas on 32-bit systems you will draw only 32 extra random bits.

In fact, since version 3.1.0, MPFR leaves the GMP random generator in the same state,
whatever the number of bits per limb. See changeset 7133 from MPFR, and
http://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-devel/2010-September/001642.html. Thus the fix is
simply to remove the "gross hack" at lines 930-942 in real_mpfr.pyx.

From what i saw in randstate, c_random calls gmp_urandomb_ui(self.gmp_state, 31).

So this has different behaviors on the gmp rand internal state on 32 and 64 bits ?

I expected that it didn't, so that adding a call to c_random() even on 64 bits (just to see, I don't plan on integrating it to Sage, removing the hack is indeed the right solution) would produce identical behaviors on 32 and 64 bits, whence my request for you to test it (in fact with the hack and without it, not with a call to c_random added, on 32 bits).

I also had little hope that it could revert the real PNRG to its previous behavior for a given seed (in order not to break existing code, outside Sage source tree I mean).

Anyway, if the mpfr code changed, its completely understandable that the random output changes, even with the same seed, so this is hopeless and not really harmful (to me at least).

Anyway, if you confirm that you get the same values that I get (with no call to c_random at all, ie without the hackish section only running on 32 bits currently), I'll post patches to remove the hack section and correct the doctests.

no it shouldn't. But beware that Sage uses MPIR, not GMP. We should check that MPIR
gives the same behaviour for the random state on 32-bit and 64-bit processors.

The files randbui.c where gmp_urandomb_ui is defined are similar in GMP (5.04) and MPIR (2.1.3.p9 in Sage).

They only call _gmp_rand defined in gmp-impl.h which looks quite similar as well (in fact I saw no diff but did not check completely, there could be some black magic somewhere deep enough).

From what I see in integer_ring.pyx and more specifically in the _randomize_mpz function where c_random is called as well, there is no different sections for 32 and 64 bits, nor different doctest in randstate.pyx (only rgp from Pari does change), so I guess it is not that unsafe to assume that MPIR behaves the same for both.

and without the "gross hack":

because MPFR contains code like

```

You mean in randstate.pyx? I guess that Pari RNG does not behaves the  same on 32 and 64 bits. The other tests (MPIR, MPFR, GAP, NTL, Python)  looks the same to me, but i might have missed something.

The spkg at the usual address is updated, if someone could test that the patch now applies on Solaris :)

Here is a review of `trac_11666_spkg.patch`:
there are small typos in `SPKG.txt`, which were already there before:
`coment` should be `comment`,
`occured` should be `occurred`,
`reccommened` should be `recommended`.

Apart from that, the more important would be to test the modified spkg.

If this was already tested by the buildbot, then I will give a positive review.
