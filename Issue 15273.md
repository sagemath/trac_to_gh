There is an bug in sagenb that is exposed with the new setuptools (`sagenb.misc.misc.get_translations` tries to list a directory that may not have been created yet).

I think that `spkg-install` should probably have the boilerplate code

```bash
if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then
   echo "SAGE_LOCAL undefined ... exiting";
   echo "Maybe run 'sage -sh'?"
   exit 1
fi
```

I'm also not sure I understand [comment:2 your comment about sagenb]: do you mean `get_languages` instead of `get_translations`? Is there an issue opened for this on the sagenb github site?

See https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/191.

Sorry, I actually looked into this a bit more, and forgot to put a comment on this -- the issue was resolved at https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/188. We are still waiting on a new release of the sagenb to be able to merge this.

So this should be "needs review", or are there other works issues? And there should be a dependency on a ticket to update sagenb.

The problem is that no new release of sagenb has been made since that pull request was merged. See https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/192.

I get lots of test failures (probably whenever importing somethnig)

```
File "src/doc/en/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.rst", line 31, in doc.en.prep.Quickstarts.Interact
Failed example:
    plot(x^2,(x,-3,3))
Expected nothing
Got:
    doctest:974: UserWarning: /home/release/.python-eggs is writable by group/others and vulnerable to attack when used with get_resource_filename. Consider a more secure location (set with .set_extraction_path or the PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable).
```

My home directory is (why does setuptools even create that directory?)

```
$ ll -d ~/.python-eggs
drwxrwxr-x. 1 release release 78 Feb  1 23:22 /home/release/.python-eggs
```

so it is entirely intentional that it is group writeable.

I wonder when that directory is created: is it during installation of setuptools or doctesting or some time in between? I don't see anything like that in my home directory. (This is on OS X, for what that's worth.)

Never mind, I see the directory now. It looks like we can change its location by setting the variable `PYTHON_EGG_CACHE`. It seems like we should do this in `spkg-install` (or in `sage-env`?). What should it be? `"$DOT_SAGE/.python-eggs"`? Something in the Sage build directory? By the way, we can also (or instead) patch the function `_warn_unsafe_extraction_path` in `src/pkg_resources.py` to silence the error.


---

It is the egg cache, it is created whenever a zipped egg is imported. We can just  install unzipped (easy_install -Z or site-wide configuration in distutils.cfg). Just silencing the error is also fine, we already patch python to be more careful about directory permissions.
