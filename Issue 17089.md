You don't need this check since if it is a projective morphism it must be some kind of projective scheme.


```
if is_ProjectiveSpace(self.domain().ambient_space()) is False or is_ProjectiveSpace(self.codomain().ambient_space()) is False:
```

Sorry to be picky, but I'd like a subscheme example that fails to be a morphism on projective space, but which is a morphism for a subscheme, ie., the indeterminancy locus does not intersect the subscheme. The example you give is already a morphism on projective space.

Otherwise, this looks fine.
