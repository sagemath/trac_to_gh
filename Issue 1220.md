Yes.  Report it on trac.  This will actually probably be pretty hard
to debug, but I will
do it as soon as I get a chance.  Modular symbols for Gamma_H are
pretty subtle...
In the meantime, keep in mind that you can compute most things by reducing
to computing modular symbols with some character.  In fact over CC at least
modular symbols for Gamma_H(N) are the same as the direct sum over
characters chi
that vanish on H of modular symbols for chi.   In particular, I think
the following
calculation shows that ModularSymbols(Gamma_H(N)) for your particular example
is just isomorphic to ModularSymbols(Gamma_0(N)):


```
sage: G = GammaH(36, [13,19])
sage: G
Congruence Subgroup Gamma_H(36) with H generated by [13, 19]
sage: ModularSymbols(G, 2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError
sage: X = G._list_of_elements_in_H(); X
[1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31]
sage: euler_phi(36)
12
sage: H.<a,b> = DirichletGroup(36)
sage: for eps in H:
...       print eps, len(set([eps(w) for w in X]))
[1, 1] 1
[-1, 1] 2
[1, zeta6] 3
[-1, zeta6] 6
[1, zeta6 - 1] 3
[-1, zeta6 - 1] 6
[1, -1] 1
[-1, -1] 2
[1, -zeta6] 3
[-1, -zeta6] 6
[1, -zeta6 + 1] 3
[-1, -zeta6 + 1] 6
sage: eps = H([1,-1])  # vanishes on X
sage: ModularSymbols(eps)
Modular Symbols space of dimension 0 and level 36, weight 2, character
[1, -1], sign 0, over Rational Field
```


Notice that the dimension is 0....

Ok, the fix is attached, with a handful more. The patch fixes the bug, which is that the `_reduce_coset` method was broken for `GammaH`. I rewrote it instead of fixing it, and it's roughly the same speed for some cases, and much faster in others: 

OLD:

```
sage: G = GammaH(99,[67])
sage: %timeit G._reduce_coset(77, -3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 42.1 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit G._reduce_coset(11, -3)
10000 loops, best of 3: 36.9 Âµs per loop
```


NEW:

```
sage: G = GammaH(99,[67])
sage: %timeit G._reduce_coset(77, -3)
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.3 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit G._reduce_coset(11, -3)
100000 loops, best of 3: 17.2 Âµs per loop
```


Also, because I was fixing up functions in `modular/congroup.py`, I got carried away and doctested all of `congroup.py` and `congroup_element.py` ... so this patch also fixes #2527. 

All doctests in `modular/` pass -- I didn't run anything beyond that.

Wow, you have done an amazing job on this -- very impressive documentation as well.

The two patches apply completely cleanly to my 3.1.alpha1.  (I think Michael's fuzz was with alpha2.)

You have included doctests showing that the original problem is solved.

I tested all in sage.modular and had one failure, which appears to be the one I already reported and Craig has sorted elsewhere:

Hi John,

that issue should be addressed with the patch at #3814. So if that fixes it I can merge the tickets from both patches.
