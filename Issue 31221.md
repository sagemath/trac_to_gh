The `cartesian_factors()` and `cartesian_projection()` element methods in `src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py` have doctests, but those doctests don't actually test the methods that are defined. For example,


```python
def cartesian_projection(self, i):
    """                                                                             
    Return the projection of ``self`` onto the `i`-th                               
    factor of the Cartesian product.                                                
                                                                                    
    INPUT:                                                                          
                                                                                    
    - ``i`` -- the index of a factor of the Cartesian product                       
                                                                                    
    EXAMPLES::                                                                      
                                                                                    
        sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [4,5]); F.__custom_name = "F"         
        sage: G = CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ, [4,6]); G.__custom_name = "G"         
        sage: S = cartesian_product([F, G])                                         
        sage: x = S.monomial((0,4)) + 2 * S.monomial((0,5)) + 3 * S.monomial((1,6)) 
        sage: x.cartesian_projection(0)                                             
        B[4] + 2*B[5]                                                               
        sage: x.cartesian_projection(1)                                             
        3*B[6]                                                                      
    """
    return self.parent().cartesian_projection(i)(self)
```


Since the `CombinatorialFreeModule_CartesianProduct` class overrides its `cartesian_projection()` method, we're not actually testing the correct code. To confirm this, you can add `print("hello world")` to the method definition and re-run the example.

Likewise in `cartesian_factors()`.

I just sat down to fix this and can't reproduce it. I wasn't even drinking this time. My best guess is that I added the `print()` statement to `cartesian_projection()` and tested `cartesian_factors()` and then moved the `print()` statement to `cartesian_factors()` and tested `cartesian_projection()`. I think I've been programming too much.
