# Issue 10594: Example unrecognized as such in FiniteCombinatorialClass.keys()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10647

Original creator: yponty

Original creation time: 2011-01-18 10:28:26

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: days28, beginner

In the method keys() of sage.combinat.finite_class.FiniteCombinatorialClass (at line 122 of finite_class.py): A missing empty line after the "EXAMPLE:" clause leads to a poorly formatted example.
Adding the missing line should fix this issue.

dbernardi: something is very wrong with your setup because your patch starts with

```
Detected SAGE64 flag
Building Sage on OS X in 64-bit mode
```


I upload a fixed version.
