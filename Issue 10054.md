Hi Sebastien,

i discovered 2 more typos, but was lazy to modify them. This is now fixed. The correct patch is trac_10055-words_clean_history_version2-tm.patch (but still named trac_10055-words_clean_history-tm.patch on the combinat branch).

Thanks for the cleaning Thierry. I added a small patch which remove the `"""` because it is not a python file. Do you agree?

Anyway, I give a positive review to your patch. So if you agree with my changes, you can change the status of this ticket to positive review.
