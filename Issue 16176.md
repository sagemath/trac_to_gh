Alternatively, if upgrade not possible, apply the attached patch. There is however no reason known atm for not upgrading. Version 3.5.2 contains a patch to fix stale zip caches which hit unsafe ticket testing with patchbot. But many other issues were fixed too.

Tarball is at https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-3.6.tar.gz#md5=8f3a1dcdc14313c8334eb6af4f66ea0a
