You are not the first to need to convert GAP permutations into Sage ones. There is `sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.from_gap_list()` that does the dirty part, just call it...

(dunno why this function is not exported, perhaps it should be, then it can be easy to find...)

Well perhaps, but is miserably fails when the group is not defined over integers.


```
sage: g=PermutationGroup(["(1,2,3)(4,5,6)","(1,2,3,4,5,6)"])                               
sage: sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.from_gap_list(g,str(g._gap_().MinimalGeneratingSet()))
[(2,5)(3,6), (1,5,3,4,2,6)]
sage: g=PermutationGroup([('a','b','c')])                                                  
sage: sage.groups.perm_gps.permgroup.from_gap_list(g,str(g._gap_().MinimalGeneratingSet()))
...
ValueError: Invalid permutation vector:  (1,2,3) 
```

Yo !

This function was so useful that I overwrote it with my code. Thanks `:-P`

LGTM. Hopefully the long tests pass everywhere after this change.
