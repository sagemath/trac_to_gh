```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots import real_roots
sage: x = polygen(QQ)
sage: f = 2503841067*x^13 - 15465014877*x^12 + 37514382885*x^11 - 44333754994*x^10 + 24138665092*x^9 - 2059014842*x^8 - 3197810701*x^7 + 803983752*x^6 + 123767204*x^5 - 26596986*x^4 - 2327140*x^3 + 75923*x^2 + 7174*x + 102
sage: len(real_roots(f)), len(real_roots(f,strategy='warp'))
(11, 13)
```
It seems different seeds give different numbers of roots:

```
sage: len(real_roots(f,seed=1))
11
sage: len(real_roots(f,seed=3))
13
```

good point. I should have written:

```
sage: sum(x[1] for x in real_roots(f))
11
sage: sum(x[1] for x in real_roots(f,seed=2))
13
```

Here's what might be a clue:  somehow calling the roots method on the "ocean" class fixes the problem (I don't yet have any idea why):

```
from sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots import *

f = 2503841067*x^13 - 15465014877*x^12 + 37514382885*x^11 - 44333754994*x^10 + 24138665092*x^9 - 2059014842*x^8 - 3197810701*x^7 + 803983752*x^6 + 123767204*x^5 - 26596986*x^4 - 2327140*x^3 + 75923*x^2 + 7174*x + 102
```

```
ctx = context(False, 1, 32)
b, other = to_bernstein(f, -1, 7)
oc1 = ocean(ctx, bernstein_polynomial_factory_ratlist(b), linear_map(-1, 7))
oc1.find_roots()
len(oc1.roots())
```
outputs 11.

```
oc = ocean(ctx, bernstein_polynomial_factory_ratlist(b), linear_map(-1, 7))
_ =  oc.roots()
oc.find_roots()
print len(oc.roots())
```
outputs 13.

I'm concerned by the fact that this ticket was delayed twice (first from 4.7 to 4.7.1, now
from 4.7.2 to 4.7.3, btw why is there no trace of the change from 4.7.1 to 4.7.2) and moreover
the priority is now changed from blocker to critical, without any justification.

Is Carl Witty (who wrote the real_roots code as far as I know) still out there?

I have glanced at the code and it's also hard to understand what is going on.\n\nPersonally I don't think this should a \"blocker\".  Simple mathematical bugs are almost never blockers.  This `real_roots()` code is also not the default real-root computing code.  If you simply do `pol.roots(ring=RR)`, this will use PARI and not this buggy code (there could still be bugs in PARI though).\n\n> Is Carl Witty (who wrote the real_roots code as far as I know) still out there?\n\nAFAIK, he is not really into Sage development anymore.",

Well, it seems nobody really cares much to solve this problem.  I have glanced at the code and it's also hard to understand what is going on.

Personally I don't think this should a "blocker".  Simple mathematical bugs are almost never blockers.  This `real_roots()` code is also not the default real-root computing code.  If you simply do `pol.roots(ring=RR)`, this will use PARI and not this buggy code (there could still be bugs in PARI though).

AFAIK, he is not really into Sage development anymore.

I found out that reducing the Bernstein coefficients to integers fixes the two instances of this bug (the one in the description and the one from comment [comment:8]). Maybe it does not solve all instances, but it is better than nothing, and it should not hurt to work with integers instead of rationals.

I suggest reviewers try to find other instances, for example with:

```
from sage.rings.polynomial.real_roots import real_roots
R.<x> = ZZ[]
B=10^11
for i in range(10^6):
   f = R.random_element((i%13)+1,-B,B)
   print f
   sys.stdout.flush()
   n = len(real_roots(f,seed=-1))
   for s in range(1000):
      if len(real_roots(f,seed=s))<>n:
         print f, n, s
         sys.stdout.flush()
         raise ValueError
```

I believe I've found the reason for the bug: the function `down_degree` decreases the
degree of the (interval) polynomial, but keeps the value `self.usign`. With the example in the description and `seed=1`, `down_degree` is called with:

```

```
and the polynomial is reduced to:

```
coeffs= (67412088, 41929949, 16504578, -2435470, -4640) n= 5
```
where it is clear that `usign=1` is wrong, since the sign of `-4640` is -1.

Looks like nice work!  I think we're going to have to add way more testing, though (I can do some of it as a reviewer patch this weekend.)  I have a collection of failing cases and I want to make sure that more of them work; we should specifically doctest your diagnosis, not just the outcome; and I want to test that the bound stuff now works.

Now that we know the problem it should be much easier to construct more test cases, too.
