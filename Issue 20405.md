The following shows that `exp_polar` is relying on a `recursion depth exceeded` exception being caught in order to function:

```
sage: sys.setrecursionlimit(50000)
sage: exp_polar(-5.0 + 8.0*I)
<segfault>
```

It's the same problem as in #20624 and it means that either `_evalf_` must be removed entirely or must be rewritten in such a way that it doesn't call `_eval_`. This is due to a change introduced in [6d107297](http://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff/src/sage/symbolic/function.pyx?id=6d107297a5d8867f1a1e9996678ffa441adc8a2d) which shuffles methods and indiscriminately masks exceptions.

Maybe it's better to move this to Pynac right now (`exp` is already).

Is there a good reason for being so strict with the argument? It basically means we can't represent -1 presently:

```
exp_polar(0+RealField(12)(pi)*I).n(12)
```

Especially because the system is quite happy to work with arguments outside the principal value range, why do we need to be so strict for numerical evaluation?

Nils, I have no opinion on your question. I just want to submit a fix. Do you see any problems with this fix? Your question very much looks to me like a separate ticket.
