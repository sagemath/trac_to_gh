I wasn't able to find an embedding which would be both pleasant to the eye and which wouldn't hide an edge... Well, I think this is still better than having no embedding `^^;`

If you can review my small patch, the whole ticket is good to go `:-)`

Your embedding looks better than what I was able to do. Positive review.
