    546 

IndexError: list index out of range

The fix is easy: we just need to add the lines

    if len(z4minmax) < 1: 
        z4minmax = [0.0, -1.0]
[    return z4minmax ]

before line 295 of sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal_data.pyx.  (Yes, I'm still intimidated by creating a patch.)  

The issue was that when the lagrange multipliers gives contradictory bounds (a good thing, since it says the enumeration can stop in that branch), it was not sending a pair of bounds, just a single element, causing a type error.

Okay, I made a patch with the change you mentioned (I think I figured out what indentation you meant, but double-check to make sure). The output of this command should be the empty array, right? That's what I gather from the data on your website/your paper.

(Also, I fixed a typo).

Thanks for doing this and for fixing the typo!  Yes, the tabbing/formatting is correct.  Am I allowed to review this?  JV

Hmm, I don't really know how that works. I mean, if you did, you'd probably want to remove your name from the authors... You could try, what's the worse that could happen?!

The added doctest really takes too long. Can the bug be tested with a shorted test? Otherwise, simply mark the test something like

```
# not tested (too long time)
```

Did someone add


```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_all(8, 10^8)
```


to the doctest?  This was just an example that caused the stupid bug and I don't think it was ever intended for a doctest.  But then we also probably want to keep it for future testing purposes, right?  

There is an easy doctest in there already


```
enumerate_totallyreal_fields_rel(F, 2, 2000)
```


and for general purposes of testing, this should be enough, IMHO.  JV

Yeah, I added that doctest: every time there is a bug fix, there has to be a corresponding doctest added to show that the bug has been fixed. Since I'm not really familiar with the workings of this part of sage, I simply took the snippet of code from the bug report and added it as a doctest. What Jeroen is asking is whether there is a shorter test that would fail before this bug fix but pass afterwards, thus showing things were fixed. Can you cook one of those up?

OK, got it.  Then yes, just use

```
sage: enumerate_totallyreal_fields_all(8, 10^6)
```

which should return 

```
[]
```

as the smallest totally real octic field has discriminant 282300416 > 10<sup>6</sup>.  This triggers the error on my unpatched version.  Is this quick enough for the doctest?

here is a review patch, with more reasonable tests.

Looks good.  The new doctest takes around 2 seconds on the AMD64 2.2 GHz system that I tested it on.  I think marking this as "long time" is still justified; I'm adding this as a reviewer patch.

mark doctest as "long time"
