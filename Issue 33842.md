# Issue 33842: pycodestyle cleanup in 6 files of src/sage/graphs/

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34079

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2022-06-25 16:58:00

We clean
- `hypergraph_generators.py`
- `independent_sets.pyx`
- `isgci.py`
- `isoperimetric_inequalities.pyx`
- `line_graph.pyx`
- `lovasz_theta.py`

It remains only 4 `E225 missing whitespace around operator` in `isoperimetric_inequalities.pyx` due to pointers.
