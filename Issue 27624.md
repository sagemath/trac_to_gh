# Issue 27624: Polymake: Better syntax to call functions with <template arguments>

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27861

Currently we have to write:

```
    polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,2)")
```

because the template brackets cannot become part of the Python function name.
(Also, but not the point of this ticket - #27736: Polymake: Turn polymake applications into objects with directories.)

Also, 

```
    polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>")(3,2)
```

does not work -- we cannot seem to create this function object. It looks for an overloaded function without arguments, which fails:

```
    TypeError: no matching overloaded instance of Polymake::tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>()
```

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Moving some tickets to 9.2. This is not a promise that I will be working on them.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
