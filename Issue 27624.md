CC:  simonking jipilab dimpase

Currently we have to write:

```
    polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,2)")
```

because the template brackets cannot become part of the Python function name.
(Also, but not the point of this ticket - #27736: Polymake: Turn polymake applications into objects with directories.)

Also, 

```
    polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>")(3,2)
```

does not work -- we cannot seem to create this function object. It looks for an overloaded function without arguments, which fails:

```
    TypeError: no matching overloaded instance of Polymake::tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>()
```
