Follow up on #29922. 
The doctester uses `RealIntervalField` for doctests involving numerical tolerances. This is an obstacle to doctesting modularized subset distributions.

We should eliminate this by rewriting it in a more elementary way.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32585
