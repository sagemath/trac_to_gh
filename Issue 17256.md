That would be all. However, I have no idea atm how to change `sympify` to convert to `zoo`. EDIT. it's not zoo, it's `Infinity` as well.

How does this one relate to #14723? I assume this is also part of your large upstream patch?  I guess in principle this one can just depend on #14723 since the `.p1` is correct if that one is `.p0`.

Yes and yes. Github pull request: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/8592

I have to say I'm totally mystified as to why this is called `zoo`.  Is this a pun?

Here is something we might as well take care of here.  But the change here itself is fine and useful.

```
sage: a = oo
sage: b = -oo
sage: c = UnsignedInfinityRing.gen()  
# really, the easiest way?  probably should do better than that, not here
sage: a
+Infinity
sage: b
-Infinity
sage: c
Infinity
sage: a._sympy_()
oo
sage: b._sympy_()
-oo
sage: c._sympy_()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError: 'UnsignedInfinity' object has no attribute '_sympy_'
```

A nice test for that would be 

```
gamma(-3)._sympy_() is sympy.factorial(-2)
gamma(-3) is sympy.factorial(-2)._sage_()
```

(note that putting it in `SR` makes it `==` but not `is`).

We really should have both directions on this ticket, I think.

That's why I asked, otherwise it would have been a separate ticket for sure.  I'll get to this today for sure.

Sorry, misunderstood the last comment.

Whats up with the dependency?

PSA: sage-pending tickets are not getting merged


---

Comment by rws created at 2015-09-25 13:57:51

The dependency is pending (because there is still no new SymPy release---0.7.6.1 is just a quick fix of Jupyter stuff) so this is pending, too.
