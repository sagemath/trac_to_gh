# Issue 19757: Arb: Euler's constant

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19994

Original creator: cheuberg

Original creation time: 2016-02-01 10:38:11

CC:  behackl dakrenn mmezzarobba â€‹fredrik.johansson

Keywords: arb

Currently,

```
sage: RBF(euler_gamma)
[0.577215664901533 +/- 4.13e-16]
```

but this runs via RIF because there are no bindings for arb's version of Euler's constant in [SageMath](SageMath).

Using arb's implementation, we would get

```
sage: RBF(euler_gamma)
[0.577215664901533 +/- 3.57e-16]
```
