Keywords: arb

Currently,

```
sage: RBF(euler_gamma)
[0.577215664901533 +/- 4.13e-16]
```

but this runs via RIF because there are no bindings for arb's version of Euler's constant in [SageMath](SageMath).

Using arb's implementation, we would get

```
sage: RBF(euler_gamma)
[0.577215664901533 +/- 3.57e-16]
```
