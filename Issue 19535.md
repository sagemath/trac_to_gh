Keywords: words, Lyndon words

Another trivial issue. The `is_lyndon` methods on finite words checks whether the word is empty, and if so, returns `True`. I have spent about a month studying Lyndon words and written a chapter about them, and I have never seen a good reason to treat the empty word as Lyndon; to me, this is highly similar to treating 1 as a prime or the empty space as connected (both being bad ideas). (The analogy between Lyndon words and primes is classical -- e.g., Radford even calls them prime words.) Either way, if the empty word is to be treated as Lyndon, then we should change the docstring of `lyndon_factorization` (it will no longer be unique with the property given), and we should explicitly point out that we disagree with the Lothaire reference. But more likely, we want to merge my patch.

This should be okay in regards to the free Lie algebra and might improve it because there is no `1`, which the empty word would correspond to. (Actually, I think that means the wikipedia page might have a mistake because that gives an extra basis vector than the naturally corresponding Lie algebra. Probably deserves a careful reading...)

Thanks for reminding me -- I've fixed the WP page.

I am okay with this. I cc-ed Frédéric and Vincent in case they had some opinions on this or knew of someone else who might be interested in this change.
