# Issue 19535: The empty word should not be Lyndon

This should be okay in regards to the free Lie algebra and might improve it because there is no `1`, which the empty word would correspond to. (Actually, I think that means the wikipedia page might have a mistake because that gives an extra basis vector than the naturally corresponding Lie algebra. Probably deserves a careful reading...)
