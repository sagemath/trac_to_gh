This isn't going to be easy. Given that it seems not used much, I wonder if it's worth the effort to support it.

As far as I know, it's not used at all by https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/ nor by the Sage interact library `src/sage/interact`.

Do you have interesting examples of interacts using `layout`? It would be good to have some test cases.

Andrey is correct.  One of the annoying things about working with an open source project is we have no clue sometimes what people produce.  I am pretty sure that many of John Travis' interacts (including via WeBWorK) use this parameter.

As I said "many of them started using the list layout". One big problem with interacts that don't use it (or some other means for the same purpose) but have multiple controls: it does not fit on the screen with acceptable level of zooming to be used on a projector in class.

I don't recall using interacts once for research in 10 years of using Sage, but for teaching I almost exclusively use interacts, some of them got quite popular with students, and were beyond what Wolfram Alpha can do.

It is also quite frustrating to have instances when interacts user code has to be different depending on the used backend, so it would be nice to converge [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) and Jupyter API. One problem with [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) implementation relying on HTML id - it cannot be copy-pasted (or automatically generated several times) on the same page since ids are supposed to be unique.

+100

If cloud, cell, and Jupyter (now that sagenb is not part of the discussion) versions could converge (including controls depending on other controls etc.) that would be a very good thing.  Slight differences might also impact MathBook XML, which in principle is supposed to be able to take one source and convert to all three of these formats.

The documentation of `layout` in sagenb says this:

```
        - ``layout`` - a dictionary with keys
          'top','bottom','left','right' and values lists of rows of
          control variable names.  If a dictionary is not passed in,
          then the value of layout is set to the 'top' value.  If
          ``None``, then all control names are put on separate rows in
          the 'top' value.
```

I don't understand what this is saying. If somebody can explain me how exactly the `layout` parameter works, then I might consider working on this.

In Sage Cell, the `layout` parameter is actually undocumented.

I'm not saying that interacts are barely used, I'm saying that the `layout` keyword of `interact` is barely used.

Fair enough:

```
$ wc /var/log/sagecell.stats.log 
   1446034  112102774 1427723122 /var/log/sagecell.stats.log
$ grep "interact" /var/log/sagecell.stats.log|wc
 139924 25490159 300694167
$ grep "interact" /var/log/sagecell.stats.log |grep "layout" |wc
  15287 6480767 75148560
```
So 10% of requests are interacts and 10% of interacts do use layout. Of course, that's just 1% of the total number.
