Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: pseudo-differential operators, integrable systems, mathematical physics

Here's my first take at adding support for pseudo differential operators.

The algebra of these operators are a convenient framework for the description of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP)hierarchy (this has to do with mathematical physics / integrable systems).
