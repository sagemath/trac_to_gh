While looking at this file on github, I realised the documentation of one method was not perfect. I edited the documentation directly on github and created a pull request:

What is the procedure github pull request? Should I create a branch?

I am not sure pull-requests in github are acceptable

I wasn't sure and I wanted to test that option. For just editing documentation, it seems desirable.

I just redone the changes as a branch.
