I think we should add `dimension` as an alias for `rank` in `FiniteRankFreeModule`.

Thanks for catching this. I'm working on an improvement and will add some more tests as well.

Let's not do changes to the modules API on this ticket.

I've created #30215 for `dimension`.

For `CombinatorialFreeModule` and `FiniteRankFreeModule` I'm getting both `NotImplementedError: ambient_space must be a standard free module`.

I assume that #30094 takes care of this?

If this is the case, you can put this on positive review on my behalf.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-07-25 04:04:13

That's right. Based on #30094 and the present ticket, the functionality will be implemented in #30198.

Thanks!
