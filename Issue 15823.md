# Issue 15823: package patch mechanism can't patch spkg-install inside spkg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16060

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-04-05 07:30:13

See the scenario in #15814 where the original tarball is an SPKG with defect `spkg-install`. A possible fix in `sage-spkg` would be to first check inside `build/pkgs/packagename` for the `spkg-install` to run.

`spkg-install` is a file provided by Sage. No need to add a patch, just edit the file.

Close as invalid.
