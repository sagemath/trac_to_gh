Thanks for the hint. Is it better now? (I also made the version with `proof=False` return all the roots instead of only the isolated ones.)

I have doubts about the choice of refusing to run with `multiplicities=True`, any thoughts?

It looks reasonable to me (without having actually tested the code).

For an interval polynomial, returning certified root clusters would be a reasonable interpretation, although it's a bit dangerous since a user might expect (naively) to obtain the true multiplicities for the intended exact polynomial.

Yes, it would probably be clearer to have a separate method for that case. But we could also simply return all the roots with multiplicity one (since, unless it was called with `proof=False`, the function always fails on multiple roots).

You have included a lot of example but they are right now unreachable from the documentation. It would be better to have a sample of it directly in the generic `roots` method. It is good to advertise it at this generic level since someone might want to use this even with polynomial with integer coefficients.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^3 + 3).roots(CBF, multiplicities=False)
[[-1.442249570307408 +/- 3.83e-16] + [+/- 3.59e-19]*I,
 [0.7211247851537042 +/- 9.34e-18] + [1.249024766483406 +/- 4.80e-16]*I,
 [0.7211247851537042 +/- 9.30e-18] + [-1.249024766483406 +/- 4.80e-16]*I]
```


It is sad that the following is not working

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: (x^3 + 3).roots(RBF, multiplicities=False)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: root finding for this polynomial not implemented
```


The variable `i` is implicit. Might be good to declare it as `size_t`.

Why did you decide to not include the while loop in the `try`/`finally`?

Done... But this is really a symptom of deeper design issues (of the documentation framework, and of the `_root_univariate_polynomial` mechanism)...

I have some work in progress to interface the `arb_fmpz_poly` module, but I'm waiting for some other tickets to get merged to avoid conflicts.

Why?

I don't know. Must have been because of the `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` block. But neither solution is perfect, I can move it in the `try` block if that's more to your taste.
