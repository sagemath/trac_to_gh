sage: assume(x,'integer')
sage: x.is_integer()
False

sage: assume(x>0)
sage: x.is_positive()
False

sage: f=function('f')(x)
sage: assume(f>0)
sage: f.is_positive()
False
```

Syncing with Pynac will allow limited but fast decision making (without Maxima) through already existing flag logic in Pynac.
