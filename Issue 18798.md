# Issue 18798: sync elementary assumptions on symbols/functions with Pynac

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19035

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2015-08-15 07:54:01


```
sage: assume(x,'integer')
sage: x.is_integer()
False

sage: assume(x>0)
sage: x.is_positive()
False

sage: f=function('f')(x)
sage: assume(f>0)
sage: f.is_positive()
False
```

Syncing with Pynac will allow limited but fast decision making (without Maxima) through already existing flag logic in Pynac.

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/81

The branch of this ticket contains adaptions on the Sage side. The Pynac interface declarations are already committed (appearing in version 0.4.4+). The complete interface may be in Pynac-0.5.

Example working with current Pynac master:

```
sage: assume(x>0)
sage: x.is_real()
True
sage: x.is_positive()
True
sage: forget(x>0)
sage: x.is_positive()
False
sage: x.is_real()
False
sage: assume(x,"real")
sage: x.is_real()
True
sage: x.is_positive()
False
```

I guess `:meth:`assume`` should be `:func:`assume``. And similarly `:meth:`forget()``.

In `the complex plain` do you mean the complex *plane*?
