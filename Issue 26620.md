```
hex = LatticePoset({1: [2, 3], 2: [4], 3: [5], 4: [6], 5: [6]})
hex.is_supersolvable(certificate=True)
```


outputs plain `False`, but it should output `(False, None)`.

Thanks.

I tested with all lattices up to 9 elements, and there was no more errors of this `.is_something(certificate=True)` -type.
