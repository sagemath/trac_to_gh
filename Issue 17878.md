# Issue 17878: Add BackendEmacs so sage-mode can have it's own playground for typesetting output

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: iandrus

Original creation time: 2015-04-03 04:03:17

Keywords: sage-mode, emacs

With the inclusion of #17234, we have a framework of creating typeset output in emacs without interfering with other systems, or piggy backing on things like EMBEDDED_MODE.

This ticket is only for the Sage half of the work.

For those, like me, who don't fully understand the display_manager stuff, try this recipe


```
from sage.repl.rich_output.backend_emacs import BackendEmacs
from sage.repl.rich_output import get_display_manager
emacsdm = BackendEmacs()
get_display_manager().switch_backend(emacsdm,shell=get_ipython())
```


Then you can use


```
%display text latex
```


to test it out.  Of course it will look rather ugly since sage-mode isn't formatting it for you.
