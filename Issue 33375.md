(split out from #33549)

Various Sage modules contain non-private helper functions that are only used in `TESTS::` blocks of doctests of the same module.
Example:
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/matrix_space.html#sage.matrix.matrix_space.test_trivial_matrices_inverse

They clutter the documentation and their module's namespace. We rename them (with deprecation) to `_test_...`. 
Thus they will no longer appear in the built documentation unless `SAGE_DOC_UNDERSCORE` is set.
