# Issue 33375: Rename some test_... functions to _test_... (with deprecation)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33612

(split out from #33549)

Various Sage modules contain non-private helper functions that are only used in `TESTS::` blocks of doctests of the same module.
Example:
- https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/sage/matrix/matrix_space.html#sage.matrix.matrix_space.test_trivial_matrices_inverse

They clutter the documentation and their module's namespace. We rename them (with deprecation) to `_test_...`. 
Thus they will no longer appear in the built documentation unless `SAGE_DOC_UNDERSCORE` is set.

LGTM (patchbot failure seems unrelated).
