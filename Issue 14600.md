Keywords: spkg-install filelist destdir

To keep track of installed files, it's probably most convenient to use a unified install program within all spkg-install scripts, like the one included within #14796.

For transitional purposes, the non-#14796 build-system should provide an install program within $PATH. I propose to place it as `sage-dist-install` into `$SAGE_SRC/bin`. It should just ignore -F <filelist> for now.

(NB: This won't work for python-distutils packages, as they are baking their own cakes again)

Python distutils at least encapsulates the file operations in `distutils.file_utils`, so it would be a finite task to hook into that as well.

The alternative is to serialize the install phase and diff the `SAGE_ROOT` tree before and after.

Yet another possibility is to use separate install trees for each spkg in "sage-the-distribution", as in Nix or Stow.

For example. but i have no idea how to "hook into that" yet without patching distutils. is there any python magic you have in mind?

Won't give me DESTDIR. serialization is one of the uglier hacks (no way). diff takes quadratic time (even less way).

Just complicates the issue. better is supporting no "install" at all (like sage-doc currently does).

You can patch it (Python / setuptools / whatever), but you don't necessarily have to, as most Python objects are mutable, including functions / methods, i.e., you can overwrite them... :-)


```
In [1]: import distutils.file_util

In [2]: def foo(s,t): print "Hello"
   ...: 

In [3]: distutils.file_util.copy_file=foo

In [4]: distutils.file_util.copy_file("bar","baz")
Hello
```



And you could e.g. do so in an spkg's `setup.py`, to use some alternate implementation (provided elsewhere).

I don't quite understand. Are you proposing to patch the upstream package? (this would be worse, as it involves more than just distutils patching).

I need something of the kind

```
setup.py install USEMYOWNFILEUTIL
```

or

```
IMPORTPATH=myhackedfileutil_path setup.py install
```

within spkg-install. is this even possible?

Sure, I was just writing a post scriptum:

And in the latter case, you wouldn't even have to patch / modify the spkg's / upstream's `setup.py`, but just `spkg-install` (or whatever that will become), as you can also do things like

```sh
python <<EOF
# Do some stuff, e.g. modifying distutils.file_util.*
# (preferably importing an alternate implementation located elsewhere)
import sys
sys.argv = ["setup.py", "install"]
execfile("setup.py")
EOF
```


Or just create a (shell) script that does similar, and call that instead of doing `python setup.py install`.

autotools uses $(INSTALL), which can be overriden with anything. also others, otherwise broken make based build systems use $(INSTALL) and $(INSTALLDIRS).

def B(*args, **kwds): return B(args, kwds)

There is now `sage-dist-install`, `sage-dist-make`, `spkg.mk` and `sage-setup.py` within my WIP branch on github.

Please have a look whether this could break anything.
