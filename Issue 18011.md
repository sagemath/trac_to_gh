I refuse to accept that `git trac create -h` does not provide information on `git trac create`.

Aha! I just see that my version of `git trac` was not up-to-date. Meanwhile (after pulling in the last changes) it works in the way that I wanted:

```
> git trac create -h
usage: git-trac create [-h] [-b BRANCH_NAME] summary

positional arguments:
  summary               Ticket summary

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BRANCH_NAME, --branch BRANCH_NAME
                        Branch name
```
