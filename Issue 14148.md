# Issue 14148: Bug in parsing Maxima output with factorial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14352

Sage interprets the Maxima factorial operator as the inequality symbol in some cases:


```
sage: factorial(x) == 6                                                   
factorial(x) == 6
sage: _.simplify()
x != 6
```


I set the priority to critical because this can produce wrong answers.

Maxima uses # for inequality, so ! should never be interpreted as such.

I think this is a duplicate of #11539.  Do you agree?
