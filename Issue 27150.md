# Issue 27150: bug in saturation of points on elliptic curves over number fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27387

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2019-02-28 15:04:55

Keywords: elliptic curves, saturation


```
K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-26)
E = EllipticCurve([a,1-a,0,93-16*a, 3150-560*a])
P = E([65-35*a/3, (959*a-5377)/9])
E.saturation([P],one_prime=2)
```

raises a TypeError.

This is curve http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/2.2.105.1/5.1/a/1

In the example E has a 2-torsion point T and P+T can be halved so the saturation is not trivial:

```
P.division_points(2)
[]
T = E.torsion_points()[0]
(P+T).division_points(2)
[(-1/4*a + 3/4 : 59/8*a - 317/8 : 1), (-2*a + 11 : -19*a + 107 : 1)]
```

The problem is caused by the following:

Let K be a number field, E an elliptic curve over K, and Q a prime of K where E has good reduction.  Let P be a point in E(K) which has good reduction at Q, meaning that the affine coordinates of P are integral at Q.  Then Sage allows us to compute EmodQ = E.reduction(Q) and then one thinks that EmodQ(P) will be the image of P on the reduced curve, but it might not be!  In general, and certainly if the model of E is not minimal at Q, then EmodQ is formed by taking the local minimal model of E at Q and then reducing that.  Then, there is no reason why the reduced coordinates of P will satisfy the reduced equation.

For the curve in question there is no global minimal model, and the model is non-minimal at the prime Q=(2,a) above 2.  The saturation code excludes primes where E has good reduction in the proper mathematical sense, but it should also exclude primes where the model is non-minimal.

So a fix is to replace line 288 of saturation.py.  In progress.

indentation of new doctests is wrong in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_number_field.py`

Replying to [comment:2 cremona]:

I think you mean bad reduction here.

I think the fix is correct besides the indentation of doctests. When I tried to fixed the indentation myself, the html output I get becomes very wrong so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Thanks for the review.  You are right that I wrote "good" when I meant "bad".

I have fixed the indentation issue in ell_number_field.py
