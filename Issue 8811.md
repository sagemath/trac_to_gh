I carefully checked the results of translation_factor, adding extra tests to compare with Kashiwara's private notes. Nicolas and I discussed at length the correct factors for type BC (see the corresponding doc in the code).

All tests passed on massena and all tests in combinat/root_systems passed on my machine.

Positive review.
