This seems to be exercised by #23572 but obviously isn't caused by it:

Again, not random but GC-related.

Looks more like not keeping stdio/stderr/ptty echo separated properly. Possibly related: #26625

For what is worth, i can reproduce the error on my 32bit patchbot, see the log https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/debian/9.7/i686/4.9.0-7-686/tmonteil-debian-stretch-32/2019-03-20%2016:16:33

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

For information, the problem is still there on 8.8.beta2 : https://patchbot.sagemath.org/log/0/debian/9.7/i686/4.9.0-7-686/tmonteil-debian-stretch-32/2019-04-17%2019:25:29 but apparently, other (non-32-bit) patchbots do not see this issue https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing keywords from "random_fail" to "random_fail, sdl".
