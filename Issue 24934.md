This is not ready for merging because there's no upstream release.
Setting it to `needs_review` only so the patchbots run on it.

Hi Matthias,

I don't understand the ticket description. Normaliz works perfectly well with flint master.

Also, patchbot will never run this ticket since they are not able to download the tarball.

No worries, this ticket no longer needed with the current e-antic.

Obsolete because of #29719 (upgrade to flint 2.6.0), should be closed
