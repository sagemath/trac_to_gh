Equivalently to #21645 a symbolic limit function is needed, in this case #20179 supposes that expressions can be searched for unexpanded limit functions which is not possible if it is anonymous.

The latex conversion would be easily fixed. However, the fails show that there is the problem that the limit function can have either 3 or 4 arguments, the latter with an additional direction. I don't think Sage can handle this at the moment without tuples as arguments like in `hypergeometric`, and this would change the code substantially.

EDIT: it may be possible to use two functions; checks elsewhere would then have to be done with both. The Maxima interface would have to know about it.
