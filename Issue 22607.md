Equivalently to #21645 a symbolic limit function is needed, in this case #20179 supposes that expressions can be searched for unexpanded limit functions which is not possible if it is anonymous.

Doctest failures in `src/sage/calculus/calculus.py`.

The latex conversion would be easily fixed. However, the fails show that there is the problem that the limit function can have either 3 or 4 arguments, the latter with an additional direction. I don't think Sage can handle this at the moment without tuples as arguments like in `hypergeometric`, and this would change the code substantially.

EDIT: it may be possible to use two functions; checks elsewhere would then have to be done with both. The Maxima interface would have to know about it.

Maybe it is excusable in this case to write a customized `__call__` member, as long as it's an internally only used function.

Much easier: `nargs=0` does the trick. Please review.

Needs a rebase over the latest `develop`.
