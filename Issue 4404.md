CC:  burcin kcrisman was mhansen

As requested by Stan Flavia on sage-support, replace the single "Download to a file" menu option in the notebook by two options:
* Download to a file
* Download to a file w/ history

The first would download a version of the file without the revision history.  The second would do what the current "Download to a file" command does.

One should also discuss the possibility of an option to download *just* the worksheet.txt, for those accessing Sage only via their browser.

SageNB no longer exports revision data, so I think this should be closed.

And exporting just the txt or whatever file would also still be good, though in the meantime that may be a different ticket.",

Okay, so maybe the ticket should be reversed in order.  Are you saying that it is impossible to have Sage export revision data at all now, or that it isn't implemented?  I can't find it quickly, but there have been discussions on cases where this could be useful.
