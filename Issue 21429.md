This is kind of first part of #17147.

This will 1) make `Posets.DivisorLattice(n)` faster; for example for `n=123456789098765432100` it took 0,87 seconds without this, 0,17 seconds after this, and 2) make the linear extension to always be ascending numbers; try for example `Posets.DivisorLattice(12).meet_irreducibles()`.

If this breaks nothing I will continue with other poset examples.

To fix things, you should create a new branch that is at the current commit (5ae54b3) and then reset this branch to the previous commit (87bd385). This will involve a force push here, but that's okay.

Edit - Actually, if you want to remove the dependency of #20434 on this, you could cherry-pick the commit 5ae54b3 onto a new branch.
