# Issue 22862: Use rational_cuspidal_subgroup instead of rational_cusp_subgroup to compute a divisor of the rational torsion order of a modular abelian variety

The rational cusp subgroup is a subgroup of the rational cuspidal subgroup. We should use the rational cuspidal subgroup since that could lead to a better bound.

ok, assuming that you know what you do.

By the way, the related old ticket #6925 needs care.
