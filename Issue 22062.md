# Issue 22062: Graphs should understand iterators

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22299

Original creator: pelegm

Original creation time: 2017-02-03 15:18:39

Graph constructors should be able to accept and understand iterators rather than just lists of neighbours.

That would be great, but before I think that the `Graph` constructor must be improved (cleaned, reorganized, etc.). This task was initiated in #19477.

#19477 is a long standing merge conflict. Do you believe it is going to be abandoned, and perhaps we should at least make this work in the meanwhile?

The original author of #19477 will not work on it anymore. So feel free to take the lead.

Changing keywords from "" to "days94".

Observation: the problem is not in the `.add_edges` method, which accepts iterators.

The problem is in the Graph constructor. It must deduce the input format (i.e., type of variable `data`). I don't know how to do that.

I'm on it, I don't think it should be too difficult.

Plase add doctest that shows this new behaviour.

Instead of importing `collections` and testing for `col.Iterable` why not just directly import `Iterable`?

Can you document the logic behind these lines?

```sage
           (not data[1] or (
                isinstance(data[1], (list, tuple))
                and isinstance(data[1][0], col.Iterable)))):
```

I.e. either there are no edges or there are and ...?

vittucek, maybe add your name in Reviewers?

Why did you add the same test three times?  You should always test all corner cases, for example the case when the edges iterator is empty. Also, can you please add some reasonable use cases into EXAMPLES section so this new feature is actually discoverable by the users?

Thanks to your comments I spotted an error:

```sage
isinstance(data[1], Iterable) and
            # the "edges" item of the pair is either empty ...
            ((not data[1])
```

if `data[1]` is empty then it will never be an instance of `Iterable`. The logic needs to be different here.

Replying to [comment:12 vittucek]:
> Why did you add the same test three times?

These are different tests.  Please spot the difference between the locations of `(...)` vs. `[...]` there.

> You should always test all corner cases, for example the case when the edges iterator is empty.

Sure, I'll add some corner cases.

> Also, can you please add some reasonable use cases into EXAMPLES section so this new feature is actually discoverable by the users?

Will do.

> if `data[1]` is empty then it will never be an instance of `Iterable`. The logic needs to be different here.

That's false:


```sage
sage: from collections import Iterable
sage: isinstance([], Iterable)
True
sage: isinstance((), Iterable)
True
```

However, there are additional errors as spotted by patchbot:

```sage
sage: Gamma = Graph([('x', 'y'), ('y', 'zeta')])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot interpret 'y' as graph edge
```


(from `src/sage/groups/raag.py`)

OK, this exposes the general flaw in the current graph constructor.  When the constructor sees `Graph([('x', 'y'), ('y', 'zeta')])`, it is a list of two iterables, so it might think it is an iterable of vertices and an iterable of edges, then it fails (since 'y' is not an edge).  I can solve this particular issues, but it seems very unstable.

The aggressive solution (which might be very difficult) is trying to eliminate all auto-detect magic in this constructor.  The gentler solution would be to use a more pythonic scheme of try-except blocks, trying to interpret the data as X, failing, trying to interpret it as Y, failing, ..., until succeeding.

Rewriting the constructor might take long time, I would like to hear your opinion about it before attempting to do so.

The main issue here is that we want the Graph constructor to take anything as input and let it (somehow magically) deduce what the user has in mind. This is quite hard to do ;) 

You raised an ambiguity in the input format, and I have no clue how to solve that. May be it's not possible since 2 different users may expect different treatments. Note that vertex labels can also be tuples...

I fully agree that the Graph constructor needs to be rewritten / cleaned / improved...
