You currently have to decide explicitly whether you want a fully functional Galois group (`type=None`) or a fast Galois group (`type="pari"`).  We should instead create an object that lazily computes any relevant attributes so that we can have a unified interface.

```
        Check that it works for relative number fields.  This behavior will change in the future::

            sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
            sage: L.<b> = NumberField(x^2 - x + 17*a)
            sage: G = L.galois_group()
            ...DeprecationWarning: Use .absolute_field().galois_group() if you want the Galois group of the absolute field
