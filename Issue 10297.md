Keywords: symmetrizable matrix

Square matrices lack methods for checking (skew-)symmetrizablilty. Those methods are needed to implement cluster algebras and quivers.

All tickets associated to the original Cluster Algebra and Quiver Package have now been closed, and appear in Sage as of 5.9.beta2.
