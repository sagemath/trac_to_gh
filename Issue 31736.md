In `src/sage/geometry/triangulation/point_configuration.py`,
the pyflakes warning about `ker` can be ignored:
`ker` is defined at the end of the first round of
the while loop, and used at an earlier point inside
the while loop but only from the second round on.

This ticket will conflict with some other tickets that touch the same code, best to merge them here

Replying to [comment:12 chapoton]:
> duplicate of #32571

Are there tickets to clean up the remaining `relint` failures? This is looking really good now.

waiting for one ticket changing misc (#32573) to be closed, before tackling the remaining "metaclass" problem.


---

after #32581, there will remain "metaclass" and "sagenb" issues, I think
