# Issue 14587: Named finitely presented groups

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14791

Original creator: dshurbert

Original creation time: 2013-06-21 00:56:38

Assignee: joyner

Keywords: group presentations, free groups

Using the existing groups catalog framework, users are given the capability to
create "named" groups as finite presentations. The goal of this addition to Sage is to make the concepts of free groups and group presentations more accessible to the typical undergrad, allowing them to work with standard groups introduced in an introductory level abstract algebra course. 


```
sage: groups.presentation.Cyclic(17)
Finitely presented group < a | a^17 >
sage: groups.presentation.Dihedral(8)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^8, b^2, a*b*a*b >
sage: groups.presentation.DiCyclic(5)
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^10, b^2*a^-5, b^-1*a*b*a >
sage: groups.presentation.KleinFour()
Finitely presented group < a, b | a^2, b^2, a^-1*b^-1*a*b >
```


More groups are to be implemented soon. Feedback/suggestions on implementation
details are highly encouraged.

The printing of free group elements changed in the latest GAP update, this leads to doctest failures of the kind

```
Failed example:
    D = groups.presentation.Dihedral(7); D
Expected:
    Finitely presented group < a, b | a^7, b^2, a*b*a*b >
Got:
    Finitely presented group < a, b | a^7, b^2, (a*b)^2 >
```

The patch should be rebased to the latest sage beta (5.11.beta3 as of today)

Minor nitpick: Don't end docstrings with a blank line. It just wastes vertical space needlessly. The `"""` end marker is enough visual cue that the docstring is finished.

Fixed doctest failures caused by the new printing of free group elements.
(And removed unnecessary blank lines)

I get a big fat warning that libgap is being loaded on Sage startup. You should `lazy_import` in `sage/groups/groups_catalog.py`.

The following code placed in `sage/groups/groups_catalog.py`:

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import( 'sage.groups', 'finitely_presented_catalog', 'presentation' )
```

Has the desired effect (libgap is no longer loaded on startup), however `groups.lazy_import`
is now part of the global name-space. Any suggestions for removing this side-effect?

How about this change instead:

```diff
diff --git a/sage/groups/all.py b/sage/groups/all.py
--- a/sage/groups/all.py
+++ b/sage/groups/all.py
@@ -21,4 +21,4 @@

```

Yes, the whole groups catalog should be lazy.

Comment by dshurbert created at 2013-07-26 23:04:12

Just made the `groups_catalog` import in `sage/groups/all.py` lazy. Added some documentation and more tests.

Looks good to me

The patch needs a proper commit message.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-08-17 11:20:17

There is a conflict with #14910: both patches add the same reference `[TWGT]`.

Hey,

Here's a small review patch which fixes a few typos and formatting in the documentation, and if you're happy with my changes, we can set this (back to) positive review.

Best,

Travis

I'm going to interpret that as a positive review.
