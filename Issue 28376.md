# Issue 28376: CombinatorialPolyhedron: attributes, H -> facet_names

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28613

Original creator: @kliem

Original creation time: 2019-10-16 06:27:41

CC:  jipilab @laisrast

Keywords: polytopes, combinatorial polyhedron

In order to be more meaningful, the name of the attribute `_H` of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` is changed to `_facet_names`. Likewise the corresponding method is renamed.

I'm starting to doubt that `_ambient_Vrep` in `CombinatorialFace` is a good name for the `Vrepresentation` names of the polyhedron.

We will have `ambient_Vrepresentation` correspond to the elements of the `Vrepresentation` that define the face.

Then again in `PolyhedronFace` its `ambient_dim` for the dimension of the polyhedron?

Anyway, I don't think it's a good choice to have `_ambient_Vrep` and `ambient_Vrepresentation` mean two different things. What would be a good alternative for `_ambient_Vrep`?

LGTM. It definitely is a better to have more meaningful name.
