Keywords: cvxopt; spkg-configure; system packages; Python library

This ticket adds an spkg-configure.m4 for cvxopt, in order to use it from a system package if possible (see #27330).

This one is a bit special, because cvxopt is a Python module.

The proposed attachment uses `python3`: I donÂ´t like that, but at this point `$ac_path_PYTHON3` is not yet defined. (Note: on FreeBSD we have no python3 by default, and I have to patch it with the real versioned program name, but I guess that `python3` is more portable)

To build Sage with it, `build/make/install` must be modified: it sets `PYTHONPATH` to `$SAGE_LOCAL`, and the system-wide Python modules are not found. It must be replaced by something like


```
"$SAGE_LOCAL:$SAGE_LOCAL/$PYTHON_SITELIBDIR:$PYTHON_SITELIBDIR"
```


with `$PYTHON_SITELIBDIR` being the site-packages directory used. So the Sage-built packages are always found in the first place, and those from the system are found when needed.

> No, it does not work. 

What goes wrong? I just did a quick test (without this branch):

1. make cvxopt-clean
2. install system cvxopt
3. touch any file in sagelib names `*cvxopt*`
4. sage -b
5. run some tests on said cvxopt files

Behavior is unchanged as far as I can tell.

However, be prepared for a long-term burden of maintenance regarding the declared version ranges. Lots of things can go wrong because the individual packages often have complicated version constraints.

How so? The version information is maintained separately in `install-requires.txt`. And on Gentoo, most of these packages are already present and maintained by somebody else.

Done.

I'm using setuptools now, because I figure it (with its vendored "packaging") is more likely to be present than the "packaging" package itself.

I think this is working as intended, but I still have to check it with python3 installed from an SPKG.

If we're using python from the SPKG, the macro should always fail (this is in its documentation), and thus we'll use SPKGs for all of the python stuff.

I don't think we need to bail out with an error unless that process can somehow do the wrong thing?

So it's best to tell them upfront that it won't work, instead of making them go through an hours-long build and failure and mailing list Q&A.

We could make that possible with another option, like `--enable-user-site-packages`, that would undo the intentional breakage in sage-env:


```python
# Set PYTHONUSERBASE to avoid picking up non-Sage versions of
# Matplotlib, numpy, etc. See http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19612.
#
# For more history (it used to be PYTHONNOUSERSITE=yes which killed
# the ability to do "sage -pip install PACKAGE --user"), see
# http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14243 and
# http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18955.

if [ "$PYTHONUSERBASE" = "" ]; then
    PYTHONUSERBASE="$DOT_SAGE/local"
    export PYTHONUSERBASE
fi
```


The "system" site packages do work either way... you're just getting a different "system" with the SPKG than you would with `/usr/bin/python3`. Regardless, I only build with `--with-system-python3=force`, so I won't belabor this distinction.

I'll change `--enable-system-site-packages` to set `--with-system-python3=force`.

But then how do we test that this new experimental switch actually works on a distribution?

The `distros` information is not just for the user, but also for provisioning the test environment on GH Actions etc.

Not every package with an `install-requires.txt` requires `--enable-system-site-packages`. Hiding the package checks in two different places is also not great for maintainability; but more importantly, not every package uses the same check. Some have DEPCHECKs, and in the future I'm sure we'll need feature tests to ensure that e.g. matplotlib has support for our documented export formats.

You sure setuptools isn't there? The new autoconf macro uses it to check for all of the other packages. If the whole thing is not crashing and burning (and if I did not flip an exit code somewhere...) setuptools is probably there.

Maybe something to do with `export PYTHONPATH="$(pwd)/src"` in pip's `spkg-install.in`.

That part is probably fine but huge merge commits aren't very nice to review.

There are a bunch of other python packages with similar spkg-configures that I skipped initially. Once the `--enable-system-site-packages` mechanism works well enough to enable by default, I'll go back and replace them all at once with the trivial python spkg-configure that all of the other packages are using.

So both are supposedly running the symlink `/Users/runner/work/sage/sage/.tox/local-homebrew-macos-standard/local/bin/python3`, which should point to the real homebrew python3, by way of its being near the front of `PATH`.

I think this explains all of the problems observed so far:

I have been assuming that the venv would be searched before the system paths. When it isn't, installing an SPKG to override an unusable system package doesn't work.

Sort of. It actually winds up doing the right thing in most cases, but pollutes the logs and probably wastes a few seconds.

If the dependency is installed as a system package, an error gets thrown and the whole thing is retried with `--no-deps`, which makes it work. For example with system setuptools:

I'm not sure what all it's doing, or how undesirable it is in the general case. It doesn't take noticeably longer, and everything works out in the end.

I suppose I'll add both `--no-deps` and `--ignore-installed`, but only when `--enable-system-site-packages` is on. If it ever becomes default, we'll just have to run a CI with `--disable-system-site-packages` to detect stale deps using that warning.
