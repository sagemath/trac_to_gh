Currently, the optional cryptominisat package spkg refers to CryptoMiniSat 2.9.6. Currently, CryptoMiniSat version 3.2 is released. Actually, there is no release (git tag) for versions < 3. To include this package in sage-on-gentoo, it is convenient to be able to refer to a release.

So, both 'to stay current' and for practical reasons (for Gentoo Linux developers), I would like to request that the cryptominisat package be updated. (And understand that time constraints may not allow for this.)

Looks like it isn't going to be that straight forward:

CryptoMiniSat needs

* CMake (we don't have that)
* libz (we have that)
* libboost (we have a cropped version, possibly not all we need)
* libboost-program-options (we don't have that)
* m4ri from GITHUB (we have that)

And I read that yesterday which is not a problem for me but may be one for you :

http://www.msoos.org/cryptominisat-3/
Is CryptoMiniSat 3 tuned to solve cryptographic instances?
No. In fact, it can’t process XOR clauses natively so maybe CryptoMiniSat 2 would be a better choice for those types of instances.

By the way, I was impressed at how fast Cryptominisat solved a graph problem I had at that time. Too bad I cannot easily say that the sum of 50 bolean variables should be equal to 10 with SAT clauses `T_T`

Perhaps I should, to solve the "sage-on-gentoo wants releases" problem until the dependency problem can be sorted out, ask upstream to provide a release of 2.9.6?
