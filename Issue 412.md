# Issue 412: Renaming NTL C aliases to make them more futureproof

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jbmohler

Original creation time: 2007-08-09 02:32:58

Assignee: was

Here's a beginning of the huge NTL rewrite which Craig Citro and David Harvey have spent so much time poring over.  All this patch does is fixes some naming conventions to prepare the way for a more piecemeal patching of the rest.  It was getting pretty ugly as a whole.

This ticket is closely related to #411, so let's get them both in.

Cheers,

I just discovered that it seems quite difficult to download the patch from trac (or I'm being stupid?)

Here's a link:
[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jbmohler/patches/ntl_renaming.patch](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jbmohler/patches/ntl_renaming.patch)

Note that trac 411 is a pre-requisite!
