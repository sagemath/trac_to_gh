I'm almost embarassed to bring it up since it happens to be my name, but I would have brought it up in any case: is it intentional that the AUTHORS block was removed? If I understand the legal reason for having those AUTHOR blocks at all, it seems that removing one without asking those on the list shouldn't be allowed.

For the record, I'm alright with removing my name if the entire block is removed.
