It used to be that if you load a spyx file, the result of the load is cached in the $HOME/.sage/spyx directory.  This is bad, since this can get really full of junk after a while, so caching was disabled.  There were also issues with multiple architectures on a shared filesystem.  Both of this issues should be resolved. 

 Possibilities for resolving this ticket are:
     * store the cached stuff locally instead of in .sage/spyx, i.e., 
       in the same directory as the original spyx file.    This is actually
       very confusing to people, based on the confusion with .sage and
       autogenerated .py.

     * Do .sage/spyx/hostname/generated files, but every once in a while 
       delete all cached files that are older than n days.

     * Have a max cache option, and only ever cache the last n (=100?) compiled .so's.   I think I like this last option best.  Still, definitely include the hostname somehow in the cache.
