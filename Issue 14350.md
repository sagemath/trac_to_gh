# Issue 14350: Fix typo in combinat.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14554

Original creator: scmancuso

Original creation time: 2013-05-08 16:41:31

Assignee: sage-combinat

The string representation for FilteredCombinatorialClass gives the description as "Filtered sublass of " instead of "Filtered subclass of " (note the missing 'c' in the first). This is a simple correction of this typo and all places where it occurs in doctests.

Sounds good. You can set a positive review on my behalf as soon as the patchbot light goes green!

Thanks for this first contribution!

By the way, don't worry too much for *CombinatorialClass: those are
meant to disappear at some point.

Cheers,
                            Nicolas

Patchbot isn't working right, but it's doable by hand.

```
Doctesting 1 file.
sage -t sage/combinat/combinat.py
    [397 tests, 15.17 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Total time for all tests: 15.3 seconds
    cpu time: 2.4 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 15.2 seconds
```

Running full tests now but I don't think there will be a problem, Nicolas.
