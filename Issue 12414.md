The following doctest fails:

```
File "/home/jpuydt/sage-5.0.beta5/devel/sage/sage/interfaces/maxima_abstract.py", line 1595:
sage: float(maxima("1.7e+17"))
Expected: 1.7e+17
Got:
    1.6999999999999997e+17
```


I checked the problem is present in "./sage -maxima", and reported [upstream](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3494716&group_id=4933&atid=104933).

The problem was in ECL and is fixed upstream (thanks Juan Jose Garcia-Ripoll).

A package containing the patch is available here :
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jpuydt/ecl-11.1.2.cvs20111120.p2.spkg

This package is mostly known to fix the problem on ARM ; I'm running 'make ptestlong' on ARM, and will report the results.

I'll also check X86_64 as soon as I'll have re-compiled 5.0 on sage.math, but if someone can beat me to it, the better!

The package passes the integration.pyx tests on ARM... but without the patch!
