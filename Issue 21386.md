Curious. The doctest change seemeed necessary, but not anymore.

I think I explained this already. The only exact numeric value that can go into `inverse()` is zero. All others are inexact. Otherwise the doctest that fails is:

Where do you get the idea of a standard for versioning? I could use ISO 8601 of the release date as well for the version string. There is a tradition to use major/minor/micro for Pynac, and I changed micro from 9 to 91 (ninety one) to stay lexicographically consecutive.

I have a problem with the version number. In semantic versioning, incrementing by 82 implies that many private releases in between versions, which clearly wasn't the case. This version number is inconsistent with the entire versioning history of Pynac.
