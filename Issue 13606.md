Older version of Sage was able to say when it couldn't compute Galois group. However, in 5.4,

NumberField(x^21-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

gives answer 252, but with

NumberField(x^22-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

I got

Error, the variable '_s_' must have a value

I guess this relates to kash interface.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13810

In 5.13beta1 with kash package


```
NumberField(x^15-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()
```


gives


```
