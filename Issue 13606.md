Assignee: @loefflerd

Older version of Sage was able to say when it couldn't compute Galois group. However, in 5.4,

NumberField(x^21-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

gives answer 252, but with

NumberField(x^22-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

I got

Error, the variable '_s_' must have a value

I guess this relates to kash interface.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13810

In 5.13beta1 with kash package

```

gives

```

There has been some other modifications on `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx` that conflicts with this patch.

In any case, http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/.3a6ca5.html clearly says that polynomials up to degree 23 are supported. But just changing given example `x_O:=MaximalOrder(X^2+5); Galois(x_O);` to have `x^23+5` gives segfault and degree 22 get stuck. So I suggests trying KASH only when degree <= 21.
