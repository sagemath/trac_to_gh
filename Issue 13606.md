# Issue 13606: Galois group when polynomial has too high degree

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Older version of Sage was able to say when it couldn't compute Galois group. However, in 5.4,

NumberField(x^21-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

gives answer 252, but with

NumberField(x^22-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()

I got

Error, the variable '_s_' must have a value

I guess this relates to kash interface.

Tested with 5.10: After trying R.<x>=QQ[]; (x^23-2).galois_group().order() I can't calculate for example R.<x>=QQ[]; (x^20-2).galois_group().order(). It seems that internal(?) kash instance fails and Sage don't notice it. User must restart worksheet to get this running again.

In 5.13beta1 with kash package


```
NumberField(x^15-2, 'a').galois_group(type="pari").order()
```


gives


```
ValueError: Index n must be in {1,..,None}
```

With sage-6.3 this is slightly more buggy: Trying to with 23. degreee polynomial sage says "Kash crashed -- automatically restarting." but system does not restart kash.

There has been some other modifications on `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_rational_flint.pyx` that conflicts with this patch.

In any case, http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/.3a6ca5.html clearly says that polynomials up to degree 23 are supported. But just changing given example `x_O:=MaximalOrder(X^2+5); Galois(x_O);` to have `x^23+5` gives segfault and degree 22 get stuck. So I suggests trying KASH only when degree <= 21.

As also the web page http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/kash.html has been changed to "polynomials over Q up to degree 21" (from 23), I think this is clearly the right thing to do.

OK, I'll stop doing that. Sorry.
