This patch implements a new method that lets one recognize whether a graph can be written as the cartesian products of some others. A new module is created because the documentation is rather long, and because the first aim was to write the method much more efficiently, at a much lower level.

As usual, the patch would be much harder to review if it were done all at once, and we would need two versions anyway to check the correction of the trickier algorithm.

The aim of this patch is also to obtain better plots of very symmetrical graphs.

The patch is working perfectly (install, tests, functionality, docbuild and display). Nice work!

In another patch, one should do the same for digraphs.
