The version of Maxima in Sage (5.22.1) is not the latest (5.23.2), so we should update. We need to update this along with ECL at the same time (see #10766 for the ECL update).

There are some doctest issues when both ECL and Maxima are updated, which seems to be the case every single time these are updated. The patches to fix the doctests are on the ECL upgrade ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10773

Thank you for that. It looks good to me, so I'm happy to give the patch a positive review. If you are happy to do likewise for my changes, then add yourself to the reviewer field and this can be changed to positive review. 

However, it must be merged along with #10766 - neither can be done independently of the other.

Hi,

I'm currently building the new Maxima package (on Ubuntu  10.10) and it failed because I did not have makeinfo (part of texinfo  package) installed, which did not seem to be required to build Sage so  far (and is not mentionned on !http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html)

I  guess this is related to the newly built documentation issue mentionned  above and maybe the ticket should be changed back to needs_work ?

Cheers.

Sorry, I meant that "make ptest" is fine once I install texinfo and Maxima is built.

I want to confirm that I do not have this problem with our previous Maxima (5.22.1) on the same computer.   They both seem to build the same documentation etc. (in `$SAGE_ROOT/local/share/maxima`), and the changelogs don't indicate something unusual, so I'm not sure what has changed.

after the 'nothing to be done', and it just installs the html etc., while now we have

and we get horrible error messages.  There is a lot of stuff that seems to be happening before we get to contour1.gif now.  And it all has the `+` in front, which sort of baffles me.

As someone noted, I have posted this on the Maxima list. The only record I can find with Google is this one, but you can see my question and Robert Dodlier's answer. 

http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.maxima.general/33568

I'm not sure I understand what he is saying, but I think he is saying the source tarball from Sourceforge should have the generated .info files. That does in fact seem to be so, as using `find` will show. 


```
drkirkby@hawk:~/sage-4.6.2.alpha4/spkg/standard$ find . -name '*.info'
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/pt_BR/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/pt/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/pt_BR.utf8/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/pt.utf8/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/es/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/doc/info/es.utf8/maxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/interfaces/xmaxima/doc/xmaxima.info
./maxima-5.23.2/src/interfaces/emacs/imaxima/imaxima.info
```



So it looks to me the generated files are present, so there should be no need for them to be generated. 

My Sun does have `makeinfo` present, but I've just renamed it to something else, so the command does not exist. The Maxima build did then fail:


```
make[3]: makeinfo: Command not found
make[3]: *** [maxima.info] Error 127
```


So I am in fact putting this back to "needs work"

Dave

> I will have a closer look. I am wondering if it is just a time stamp issue. I have seen the same change of behavior building on Gentoo.

I've touched all the .info files. so they are dated today, but the files they are generated from are obviously older. But that did not solve the problem. 

Someone posted this on the Maxima list:

----------

```
I think you can just cd to src and then run "make ecl".  This will just
make maxima with ecl.  No attempt will be made to build the info files
or anything else.

Ray
```


This will need a bit of looking into I think.

I've asked that very question.

This seems like a new Maxima bug to me. Hopefully we can work around it easily. Perhaps editing the Makefile.in and removing the docs directory, or something like that. But it is a bit of a pain.

Perhaps a little more minimalist approach. If `maxima.texi` is the only file that gets touched, that file is present already anyway. So you may be able to get away with "mv"-ing the original file out of the way, "configure" and "mv" the original file back if the one created by configure has the same content. The nice thing is that "mv" should not change the timestamp:
so spkg-install becomes something like:

```
...
mv doc/info/maxima.texi doc/info/maxima.texi.orig
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --enable-ecl 
check_error "Failed to configure Maxima." 
cmp -s doc/info/maxima.texi doc/info/maxima.texi.orig && mv doc/info/maxima.texi.orig doc/info/maxima.texi
```

If you want you could raise an error or warning instead when the two files do not agree.

An advantage of this approach is that you're not anything that voids manufacturer's warranty. A disadvantage could be that it doesn't work, as I haven't tested it.

Same here. 

I uninstalled autoconf, automake and texinfo. The Maxima package built fine, and all doctests (including the long ones) passed. 

So I'm happy with this. I don't really see any advantage in another method, given this does work and has been tested by a few people. Those tests (in my case at least) are not only that it builds, but that all the tests pass too. 

My tests were performed on an OpenSolaris system (quad core Xeon processor). 

I'll leave as "needs work" for now, as this is too late for 4.6.2, so we could use another method if we want. But personally I think this is fine and should be put to positive review.

I tried the minimalist approach with `include-maxima.texi` using the original 5.23.2 package and after building, the html files still had their old stamp and I didn't see excessive building activity. So I think that trick works too. I don't know how robust "mv"s property to not change timestamps is, though, so perhaps "touch" is more portable.

Thanks for all the testing guys. Yes I was also wondering about mv and time stamps, so touch may be safer.

OK guys, thanks for all this. I think we are done with this now. I know I wrote this before, but it makes it clearer if at the end. 

## Note to the release manager

This must be merged along with #10766 - neither can be done independently of the other. They should be upgraded as a pair.

And at least above it seems like makeinfo is part of texinfo.  Am I missing something here?
