In #18662 I implemented global and semi-global minimal models for elliptic curves over number fields.  I have used this code a lot in preparing data for he LMFDB.  I just ran into a bug -- the curve here is defined over a non-Galois cubic field and the error comes when doing a computation with the base change to the Galois closure:

```
K.<a> =	NumberField(x^3 - 7*x - 5)
E = EllipticCurve([a, 0, 1, 2*a^2 + 5*a + 3, -a^2 - 3*a - 2])
assert E.conductor().norm() ==	8
G = K.galois_group(names='b')
EL = conj_curve(E,G[0])
L = EL.base_field()
assert L.class_number()	== 2
EL.isogeny_class()
#RuntimeError: Error in check_Kraus_global combining transforms at 2 and 3                     
```


I will work on fixing this right away.

This was harder than expected.  When you have local transformations which work at each prime dividing 2, to get one which works at all these simultaneously is not just a question of applying CRT.  See the comments in the code for more details.
