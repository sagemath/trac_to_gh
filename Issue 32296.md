CC:  @jhpalmieri @dimpase @orlitzky

Suppress this:

```
  --with-system-_prereq={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system _prereq
```


Update what is shown as default after #32060:

```
  --with-system-gcc={no|yes (default)|force (exit with an error if no usable version is found)}
                          detect and use an existing system gcc
```


etc.
