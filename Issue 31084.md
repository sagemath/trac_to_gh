We fix this so that the [SageMath](SageMath) distribution can be listed as a repository on repology.org

Should there be a space between `>=` and the version number?

In one case there is no space, in the other there is one:

```
texttable >=1.6.3
```


```
wheel >= 0.36.2
```


Wondering whether this matters here.

Thanks for catching this, I want to standardize on the format without the space.
