Keywords: gsl

GSL 2.7 changes the definition of `gsl_complex`; see https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/yQ67Wy0gp58/m/jr6f7xtcBQAJ and #32587.

This patch changes the library code to use the macros provided by GSL instead of directly accessing the data structure, which should make things work with GSL 2.7 as well as older versions.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32607

```
      File "sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.pyx", line 17, in sage.ext.interpreters.wrapper_cdf.dz_to_CDE (build/cythonized/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_cdf.c:3144)
        z._complex.real = creal(dz)
    AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'real'
```


â€” but line 17 of `wrapper_cdf.pyx` was changed in this patch (indirectly via `sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/specs/cdf.py`) to something different from what the error message shows.

I suppose the bot should be instructed to regenerate `wrapper_cdf.pyx` somehow?
