It seems to me that there is a problem during the computation of exp(2*arctanh(x)). I tried both on Sagemath on my own computer and on https://sagecell.sagemath.org. The evaluation gives

(x + 1)/(x - 1)

However, the correct answer is (1+x)/(1-x). 

The problem also exists with exp(2*arccoth(x)) which leads to

(x - 1)/(x + 1)

and the correct answer is (x+1)/(x-1).

Do I make something wrong?

I proposed a fix to Pynac, see link in ticket description.

We should either apply it here as a patch
or wait for a new Pynac release with the fix.

We should also add doctests.

Thanks Dima for merging my pull request in Pynac.

I'm adding examples in `src/sage/functions/hyperbolic.py`.
Having added the examples in the file's main docstring,
I skipped mentioning the ticket number, which I would
have done if I had put the doctests in TESTS blocks.
Hope that's okay.

For robust test cases, something like

```
sage: bool(exp(2*atanh(x)) == -(x + 1)/(x - 1))
True
```

would be preferable as it does not depend on an exact string representation. But with *examples*, it's hard to avoid. And now that we've officially adopted pynac I guess it's OK to doctest this here, rather than in pynac "upstream."
