Hi,
I'm doing some computations based on enumerating graphs via "nauty_geng()". There, I test the odd girth of the generated graphs, and after several hours of graph enumeration, the computations stop ith errors. The errors seem to come from the function "odd_girth()" associated to the "Graph" class, with, according to the error message, a possible relation with matrices and primes (see below).

Note: I realise that I am using the precompiled version 5.8 of sage that comes with the ubuntu repository (ubuntu 12.04). So maybe this is fixed in newer versions... In any case I will now use the latest release.

Here is my code:


```
def OG7_NOhomC5(begin,end):
    F=[]
    C5=graphs.CycleGraph(5)
    for n in [begin .. end]: #range for orders
        for g in graphs.nauty_geng("%s -c -t -d2 -D6"%n):
            if g.girth()==4 and g.odd_girth()>=7:
                maps=g.has_homomorphism_to(C5)
                if maps == False:
                    F += [(g.graph6_string())]
                    print ' found :-)',F

OG7_NOhomC5(14,14)
```




And here are 2 different tracebacks, both with an error located in "odd_girth()":


```

OK, so here is one graph of order 15 for which there was an error:
`:NqA?PRGSqgbG\AWbIWyGaESp~`

And another one of order 14 (for this one, I got the "running out of prime" error):
`:MoAG`oAQ`@`RFR?PAecKhbg`

Edit: a third one, of order 13 this time: `:Lm?K`@`RHGhbrGS{PdKb`

For all of them, calling odd_girth() is not a problem. Note that they all have odd girth 5. Maybe this is a problem with the amount of calls to "odd_girth()" that are done?
