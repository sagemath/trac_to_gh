Hi Andrey,

I've looked at the patch at it looks good - it's always nice to get rid of `LatticePolytope`. ;-)
One quick question: Is there any reason you're not caching the `polyhedron()` method of `Cone`?

Were there any conflicts during merge? (I never liked what is shown when you click on "merge commit.")

No, the merge went through cleanly. I just merged the development branch in to see whether it is working with the current version. Otherwise I wouldn't have noticed the doctest warning because of the line number, since that has only recently been included (#16626). And I then based the new commit on the merged branch since it saved a lot of time when building Sage. I hope Volker will forgive the extra commit.

I just noticed that `polytope()` only seems to get used in the doctests - so not caching does make perfect sense. If you're happy, then you can set this to positive review.
