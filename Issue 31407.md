We define a class for objects in the category of topological spaces that represents the topological closure of an embedded submanifold. 
Embedded submanifolds will provide a method `closure` to construct it. As far as this ticket is concerned, this object is abstract: it only knows what object it is the closure of and the ambient space.

The purpose of this is to build a connection of manifolds to cell complexes and convex polyhedra: In a separate ticket, we will define embedded submanifolds of euclidean spaces that arise as interiors of polyhedra or relative interiors of their faces.

That sounds extremely interesting!

Btw: Do you really mean cell complexes or rather simplicial complexes?

Simplicial is too narrow - that would not be enough (without triangulating) to represent general convex polyhedra and their boundary structure. So need something slightly more general.

Right, the cube is already a counter-example.

No, I don't think so.

Looks nice!

There is a spurious line feed in the html documentation of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, which can be fixed with

```diff
     - ``name`` -- (default: computed from the name of the subset)
-       string; name (symbol) given to the closure
+      string; name (symbol) given to the closure
```

Besides, there should be some `EXAMPLES` section in the main docstring of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, and the latter should start with `r"""`, instead of `"""`, I think.

Also, in the docstring of `ManifoldSubset.closure()`, it would be nice to add an `OUTPUT` field as follows:

```
OUTPUT:

- an instance of :class:`~sage.manifolds.subsets.closure.ManifoldSubsetClosure`
```

This allows one to easily access to the documentation of class `ManifoldSubsetClosure` from that of `closure()`. For completeness, one may also add an `INPUT` field describing the arguments `name` and `latex_name` and their default values.
