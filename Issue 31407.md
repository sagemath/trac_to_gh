We define a class for objects in the category of topological spaces that represents the topological closure of an embedded submanifold. 
Embedded submanifolds will provide a method `closure` to construct it. As far as this ticket is concerned, this object is abstract: it only knows what object it is the closure of and the ambient space.

The purpose of this is to build a connection of manifolds to cell complexes and convex polyhedra: In a separate ticket, we will define embedded submanifolds of euclidean spaces that arise as interiors of polyhedra or relative interiors of their faces.

That sounds extremely interesting!

Btw: Do you really mean cell complexes or rather simplicial complexes?

Simplicial is too narrow - that would not be enough (without triangulating) to represent general convex polyhedra and their boundary structure. So need something slightly more general.

Right, the cube is already a counter-example.

No, I don't think so.

Looks nice!

There is a spurious line feed in the html documentation of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, which can be fixed with

```diff
     - ``name`` -- (default: computed from the name of the subset)
-       string; name (symbol) given to the closure
+      string; name (symbol) given to the closure
```

Besides, there should be some `EXAMPLES` section in the main docstring of `ManifoldSubsetClosure`, and the latter should start with `r"""`, instead of `"""`, I think.

I would not perform the import of `ManifoldSubsetClosure` in the `EXAMPLES` section, but rather construct the closure via the dedicated method `closure()`, since this is what the end user is supposed to do. In other words, I would rewrite the first part of the example as something like

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'R^2', structure='topological')
sage: c_cart.<x,y> = M.chart() # Cartesian coordinates on R^2
sage: D = M.open_subset('D', coord_def={c_cart: x^2+y^2<1}); D
Open subset D of the 2-dimensional topological manifold R^2
sage: cl_D = D.closure()
sage: cl_D
Topological closure cl_D of the Open subset D of the 2-dimensional
 topological manifold R^2
sage: latex(cl_D)
\mathop{\mathrm{cl}}(D)
sage: type(cl_D)
<class 'sage.manifolds.subsets.closure.ManifoldSubsetClosure_with_category'>
sage: cl_D.category()
Category of subobjects of sets
```

Also, in the docstring of `ManifoldSubset.closure()`, it would be nice to add an `OUTPUT` field as follows:

```
OUTPUT:

- an instance of :class:`~sage.manifolds.subsets.closure.ManifoldSubsetClosure`
```

This allows one to easily access to the documentation of class `ManifoldSubsetClosure` from that of `closure()`. For completeness, one may also add an `INPUT` field describing the arguments `name` and `latex_name` and their default values.
