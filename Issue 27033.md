this does not implement `--with-arb=...`, as I hope it's not needed.
And no other packages have `--with-arb=`, too.

}
```

Tests pass, apart from this amusing doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/misc/package.py", line 282, in sage.misc.package.installed_packages
Failed example:
    installed_packages()
Expected:
    {...'arb': ...'pynac': ...}
Got:
    {'.dummy': '',
     'alabaster': '0.7.12',
     'appnope': '0.1.0.p0',
...
```


Less amusing is that with arb manually installed to /usr/local on Gentoo Linux, I get a import error upon Sage startup, from deep inside sagelib.

I have to start Sage as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64 ./sage`, otherwise
I get 

```
ImportError: libarb.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

I do have `/usr/local/lib64` in `/etc/ld.so.conf`, by the way.
Does this mean we need do jump through some linking hoops here?

I certainly can add a proper runtime test in `spkg-configure.m4`, but why?

not really - it tests for a specific function from the "right" arb, I cannot imagine the other arb having it.

> I would use `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` see https://autotools.io/autoconf/finding.html.

I tried that, but then you have to analyse the result of its run, and this leads to arcane code (one needs to strip `-l`, etc...)

The problem is that sagelib isn't autotooled, and so one needes to get arb/flint-arb strings into `# distutils libraries=` directives in Cython header files.

OK you are right about the library order. Because of the check you make it doesn't matter.

It is an interesting comment about configure. Unfortunately, as far as I know running configure for a python project is still not a done thing. It doesn't mesh with the other elements of the python toolchain. There is certainly room for some configurability option in sage in regards to the optional libraries. But autotool's configure is definitely not the python way. Apart from cypari I cannot think of another python package using configure.

Let's be honest, a small configure script for sage's optional stuff and the possibly unusual stuff would be fine to run. The full configure script for the whole of the distribution is inappropriate.

`cpython` is the language. While it would be interesting to see if python could bootstrap itself, I am considering that you are stretching your credibility there.

I don't claim any credibility, but merely observe that Python 3 is moving quite a bit of its build system from setup.py to autotools.

Unvendoring everything that was sheepishly vendored into Sage over the years is an essential step towards having a self contained package for sagelib alone.

This ticket is a part of the unvendoring process. One way or another, the problem here is that arb library does not have pkg-config support, and yes, we want to support !Debian/Ubuntu arb package with non-standard naming.

the main configure configures "just" sagelib. What one has in `build/pkgs/` are vendored dependencies, which ought to disappear.
These little (or not so little) `spkg-configure.m4` scripts are part of the sagelib configure, they check that the deps are satisfied.
They have nothing to do with building the relevant deps (they deal with NOT building them).

Could you add a fallback for SAGE_ARB_LIBRARY in env.py? This wouldn't make any difference for users of the Sage build system (since it is set in sage-env-config) or distros that rename the arb library (which need to set it anyway), and would save distros that use the standard arb library name from having to worry about it
