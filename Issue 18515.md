# Issue 18515: Parent for a random partition is not correct

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18752

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2015-06-20 21:07:13

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sage-combinat deinst darij

We currently have

```
sage: P = Partitions(5)
sage: la = P.random_element()
sage: la.parent() is P
False
```

The parent should be `P`.

Thanks. Now if only I could persuade you to get back to review the not-so-easy tickets. :P
