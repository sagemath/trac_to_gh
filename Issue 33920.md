According to

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-documentation-style

`TODO` is preferred in sage. But I think `todo` should be at least known to the linter since sphinx doesn't care the case. So I am +1 to (2).

Probably both. People will write new code by imitating what they see in the old code, so the more we match the guidelines, the better.
