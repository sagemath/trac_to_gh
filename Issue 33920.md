Normalize all to `TODO`, or make the lower-case `todo` known to the linter?

According to

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-documentation-style

`TODO` is preferred in sage. But I think `todo` should be at least known to the linter since sphinx doesn't care the case. So I am +1 to (2).

Probably both. People will write new code by imitating what they see in the old code, so the more we match the guidelines, the better.

(This is another case like the blank lines between list items where I don't see the point in having a strict guideline. In this case we actually have one in place, so we should follow it.)
