Keywords: polyhedron, face iterator

This ticket collects some small improvements for the the class `FaceIterator_base` and the inherited classes `FaceIterator`, `FaceIterator_geom`:

- Add a method `reset`.
- Add a method `current` that retrieves the last value of `__next__`.
- Simplify the methods `ignore_subfaces` and `ignore_supfaces` by outsourcing the common code to `ignore_subsets`.

 Follow up:

    Use face iterator to obtain the meet of (some) vertices or the join of (some) facets.
