Two minor things: could you latex the base rings in the note about criterion, and correctly indent those two loops that you changed the `...`? (If either of those don't make sense, I can do it tonight.) Once done, you can set a positive reviewon my behalf.

Ok, I have done that, plus a few other minor things. The result is not perfect, but better than before.
