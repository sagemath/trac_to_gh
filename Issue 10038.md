The Parma Polyhedra Library (ppl) is for many workloads the fastest library for polyhedral computations. It is also high-quality code, for example GCC uses it (optionally) to optimize loops. 
* ppl has already been widely tested on a multitude of platforms.
* Native C++ with a pure C interface.
* Contains a huge testsuite _and_ passes its own testsuite (in contrast to some other polydedral library that shall remain unnamed)
Eventually, I would like to retire cddlib in favour of a cython ppl interface. As a first step, I created a ppl spkg which you can find here:

Rather than retire cddlib, it would be better I think to have cddlib as an optional backend, along with lrs.  If ppl is consistently better than those then it could be the default.

One reason I gave up any hope of making polymake standard was the compilation time; it was one reason I began writing polyhedra.py instead of improving the polymake interface.  

Are there many things in PPL that go beyond cddlib?  I am having trouble wading through their documentation so its unclear to me.

I read the module documentation and it looks quite nice, although the PPL interface and their documentation do not seem to be very clear to an unfamiliar user (as Marshall has already noted above). So if eventually Sage front-end is structured more like current geometric classes, it would be better - I guess that's exactly your plan in 4.

Can PPL compute integral points inside a bounded polytope?

That sure is a long time. I think it's because autoconf scripts takes ages on Cygwin, because Windows has no fork.

On my Sun Ultra 27, it takes less than 82 seconds to install. 


```

```


However, it fails the test suite. To be more precise, the tests it runs pass, but it fails to build some of the code needed for the tests. 

I'm not sure what the gcc option `-W` is supposed to do. According to the gcc manual `-w` (lower case) is to suppress all warnings. If `-W` does the same as `-w`, then it seems the code tries to supporess the warnings, then enable them, which seems a bit illogical. But I can't find out exactly what `-W` is supposed to do. 

BTW, this should be called ppl-0.11 and not ppl-0.11.p0. Only once a version has appeared in Sage, and patches have been applied, should it be called .p0. 

A couple more points. 
* There is no code to handle 64-bit builds on platforms where SAGE64=yes. It needs something like this:

```
    if [ "x$CFLAG64" = x ]; then 
        CFLAG64=-m64
    fi

    # If the environment variable SAGE64=yes, force building a 64-bit version:
    if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ]; then
        echo "Building a 64-bit version of ppl"
        CC="$CC $CFLAG64"
        export CC
    fi
```


That needs to be in both spkg-install and spkg-check. 

* I don't think *Unpack distribution into src/ directory* needs to be in the `Special Update/Build Instructions` section, as that is the same with every single package. 
 
* I would start `spkg-check` with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to be consistent. That said, there's nothing there which should not work with any half-reasonable shell. 

* It would be better to use `$MAKE` in `spkg-check` so the tests can be run in parallel too, which should speed things up a lot.

The testsuite fails on Solaris gcc 4.5.0, most likely due to a gcc bug. For reference, the real error is 

```
interval1.cc:76:3: error: no matching function for call to 'Parma_Polyhedra_Library::Interval<float, Parma_Polyhedra_Library::Interval_Restriction_None<Parma_Polyhedra_Library::Interval_Info_Bitset<unsigned int, <unnamed>::My_Interval<float>::Floating_Point_Real_Interval_Info_Policy> > >::join_assign(double)'
interval1.cc:194:3:   instantiated from here
```

Everything should work fine with gcc 4.5.1. In particular, I could compile and run the testsuite on OpenSolaris/i386 with gcc 4.5.1. Also note that the offending floating point code is currently not used in the Cython wrapper. A similar bug report is here: https://www.cs.unipr.it/mantis/view.php?id=110

Note that the polyhedron code does not use templates. In any case, they are not currently exposed by the Cython wrapper and they don't provide any functionality that we need in the near future. 

The updated spgk now compiles a) in parallel and b) under Solaris/gcc 4.5.1 without errors, including the testsuite.

As usual, get it here: http://www.stp.dias.ie/~vbraun/Sage/spkg/ppl-0.11.spkg

Some notes based on the posted documentation:
1. "Note that, by convention, every polyhedron must contain a point" can be clarified a little that only generator systems containing a point may define a polyhedron, since there is no point issue in defining a polyhedron by a constraint system. (I would also add that it is natural to think about "just rays" as starting at the origin, but since your goal is to wrap PPL as closely as possible, it is not your design decision.)
2. In the documentation of `Generator` I see "frac"s instead of fractions.
3. `add_space_dimensions_and_embed` and `add_space_dimensions_and_project` - I think you want `(x,y)\in P`, not `R^2`. Also the top of the documentation for "project" still says "embed". (I also find names confusing, but I guess that's how PPL calls them.)
4. Why `affine_dimension` of the empty polyhedron is 0? Shouldn't it be -1 to distinguish it from points?
5. Am I right that "concatenating" polyhedra means taking their Cartesian product? Perhaps, it is a simpler explanation than in `concatenate_assign`?
6. `contains_integer_point` has wrong documentation description about being bounded.
7. I don't understand what exactly is done by `drop_some_non_integer_points`.
8. `frequency` does not have documentation.
9. Is it necessary to have `hash_code`, especially if it only returns the dimension? My concern is that it can be confusing how it is related to standard `hash` in Python, also it seems strange to use it for mutable objects (again, because that's not how things work in Python). If this function is not used anywhere, I would suggest removing it.
10. I got upset when I read in the documentation of `max_space_dimension` that it is bounded, but the doctest immediately made me happy ;-)
21. `clear_mpz_globals`, `gmp_randrange`, `init_mpz_globals` have no documentation.

I didn't define these, they were imported from `gmp.pxi` and sphinx adds them to the documentation for some reason. Anyways, importing `gmp.pxi` is not necessary so I removed it.

Is `SAGE_LOCAL!=SAGE_ROOT/local` in your install? It should work in either case, of course. I looked into how cython discovers the dependencies and the problem is that the `setup.py` expects the extension "`.h`" for C/C++ headers. But PPL uses `ppl.hh`.

I also changed the ppl wrapper (this ticket) to rely on the search path instead of `cdef extern from "../../local/include/ppl.hh"`, which I probably should have done from the beginning.

I think there are a few more things to do for it to be standard sage material.
In module_list.py you may want to do a bit more:

```
Extension('sage.libs.ppl', 
 	  sources = ['sage/libs/ppl.pyx', 'sage/libs/ppl_shim.cc'],
 	  libraries = ['ppl', 'gmpxx', 'gmp', 'm'], 
 	  language="c++",
          depends = [SAGE_LOCAL + "/include/ppl.hh"]),
```

In your wrapper sage/libs/ppl.pyx,  ../../local/include/ppl.hh should be simplified
to ppl.hh, same for everything else that has ../../local/include, setup.py knows to
include this folder. You only needs to add things if it is in a sub-folder and then 
you do that by adding an include line in module_list.py.

I renamed the include `../../local/include/ppl.hh` to `ppl.hh`. Note that the `ppl.pyx` now really depends on #10233, because the current `setup.py` does **not** know how to include `*.hh` headers.

I also added the explicit dependency on `SAGE_LOCAL+/include/ppl.hh`.

Last, I just want to point out that now is the time to add PPL. I've fixed all outstanding bugs in `Polyhedron` that can be fixed within the current framework, and to continue improving it we need PPL.

There was no need to cc me, I have been added automatically because I commented.
I didn't react immediately because I was sleeping (time zone GMT+12).
Anyway the patch looks good to me now, the dep file looks right as well.
I will probably include this in sage-on-gentoo in 4.6.1.alpha1 forward to give 
it some coverage. I may have to request a revision bump of the version of ppl
shipped in gentoo first (currently shipping 0.10.2).

This looks very good.

One doctest problem is that on 32-bit machines we get:

```
File "/Users/mh/sagestuff/sage-4.6.1.rc1/devel/sage-t1/sage/libs/ppl.pyx", line 2299:

Expected:

Got:

```


so maybe that should be something like


```
sage: max_dim = C_Polyhedron(1, 'empty').max_space_dimension()
sage: max_dim in [357913939,1152921504606846973]
sage: True
```


or just 


```
sage: max_dim = C_Polyhedron(1, 'empty').max_space_dimension()
sage: max_dim > 1
sage: True
```

Francois, I fixed the 32 bit issue in `max_space_dimension()` a while ago, so you have an old version of the patch.

About the other errors, is this on Gentoo with your own PPL library? I suggest you use the Sage spkg since there are certain configuration options that I rely on.

I need the GMP/MPIR based coefficients and C++ interface.

ppl is 0.11, same as yours unless you patched it. We don't.
For all intent and purpose I am the co-maintainer of sage-on-gentoo by the way.
You just asked me to open a bug with myself :)
Yes this is not with your ppl spkg, I will have to create a set up to compare
results with vanilla sage and see what's different on x86. But just to make my point,
we leave enable-fpmath and enable-coefficients to their defaults which happens to be 
what you choose (unless you can point to something subbtle somewhere else), from
configure.ac:

```

case "${enableval}" in
sse)
  AC_MSG_RESULT(sse)

  # The SSE instruction set only supports single precision arithmetics:
  # double and extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.

  AC_MSG_RESULT(sse2)

  # SSE2 still does not support extended precision arithmetics.
  ;;
387)
  AC_MSG_RESULT(387)
  OPT_FLAGS="$OPT_FLAGS -mno-sse -mno-sse2 -mfpmath=387"
  # Note that the -mno-sse* and -mfpmath options are only guaranteed
  # to work with GCC.
  if test x"$GCC" = xyes
  then
    fpmath_may_use_sse=no
  fi

```

As you can see just saying "no" leaves you with the same thing as "default" and that is 387 and sse. Same thing for coefficient:

```
enableval=mpz
AC_MSG_CHECKING([the type of integral values to use as coefficients])
AC_ARG_ENABLE(coefficients,
  AS_HELP_STRING([--enable-coefficients=TYPE],
                 [select the type of the coefficients]))
case "${enableval}" in
native-int8)
  AC_MSG_RESULT([native 8 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=native
  coefficient_bits=8
  coefficient_mnemonic=nint8
  ;;
native-int16)
  AC_MSG_RESULT([native 16 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=native
  coefficient_bits=16
  coefficient_mnemonic=nint16
  ;;
native-int32)
  AC_MSG_RESULT([native 32 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=native
  coefficient_bits=32
  coefficient_mnemonic=nint32
  ;;

  AC_MSG_RESULT([native 64 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=native
  coefficient_bits=64
  coefficient_mnemonic=nint64
  ;;

  AC_MSG_RESULT([checked 8 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=checked
  coefficient_bits=8
  coefficient_mnemonic=int8
  ;;

  AC_MSG_RESULT([checked 16 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=checked
  coefficient_bits=16
  coefficient_mnemonic=int16
  ;;

  coefficient_kind=checked
  coefficient_bits=32

  AC_MSG_RESULT([checked 64 bits integers])
  coefficient_kind=checked
  coefficient_bits=64
  coefficient_mnemonic=int64
  ;;
mpz)
  AC_MSG_RESULT([GMP mpz])
  coefficient_kind=unbounded
  coefficient_bits=0
  coefficient_mnemonic=mpz
  ;;
*)
  AC_MSG_ERROR([bad value ${enableval} for --enable-coefficients, checked-int32, checked-int64, checked-int16, checked-int8, mpz, native-int32, native-int64, native-int16 or native-int8])
  ;;
esac
```

Again mpz is the default if you don't pass anything. 

So unless you have patched these behaviors - and you didn't, we have very similar configurations, we pass 

```
--disable-debugging --disable-optimization --enable-ppl_lpsol --disable-pch --disable-watchdog
```

Since I have a different result for two different x86 setup I am wondering
if the great age of my home machine (close to 8 years) is a factor.

Volker - I still can't get this to work on t2, but I think that's because of my Solaris ignorance.  How did you build and test on Solaris - in particular, did you ever change your environment variables somehow?

Oops, I accidentally dropped the fix for the `newest_version` check that is required on t2, see comment:41. Sorry about that.

Updated spkg fixes it and builds on t2.

Marshall: Are you asking about building all of Sage on t2? I don't remember any specific problem there, just source the t2-setup:

```
. /usr/local/bin/t2-setup
make
```

If you put stuff into your .profile and it is not picked up you are using a different shell with different initalization files. You can also use a binary distribution, `sage-4.6.1-sunos-32bit-5.10-sun4v-SunOS.tar.gz` works.

I noticed that 0.11.2 is out and from the release notes it sounds like you had some wish granted:

```
Bugfixes
========

o  Fixed the semantics of the `--disable-fpmath' configure option
   (which is equivalent to `--enable-fpmath=no').  It now disables all
   floating point computations and, consequently, all numerical
   abstractions based on floating point numbers.

o  The PPL no longer overwrites the SIGILL signal handler.

o  Minor documentation fixes.

o  Portability improved.

I finally **got** the problem with the maximize/minimize doctest failure. If the linear function is not bounded on the polyhedron then it doesn't make sense to ask for whether its a maximum or minimum. And PPL then does not return a consistent value for the corresponding field. 

In the attached patch I changed return value of the maximize/minimize methods to only return `{'bounded':False}` if the linear program is unbounded, since all other dictionary entries are not well-defined in that case. If the linear program is bounded then the returned dictionary is the same as before and contains information about the sup/inf value, whether it is a maximum, and where it is attained.

The new patch `trac_10039_ppl_fix_extremize.patch` needs to be applied on top of `trac_10039_parma_polyhedra_library.patch`, see also the ticket description. The new patch needs review.
