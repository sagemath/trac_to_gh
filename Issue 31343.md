Of course the tarballs are not on the mirrors yet, this only happens after the ticket is merged etc.
 You need to

```
./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url
```
Then the URLs in checksum.ini files will be used if nothing is found on the mirrors.
Due to this feature (crucial for CI), nobody lists explicit tarballs in ticket descriptions any more.
 
(Or look at checksum.ini, find the URL, manually upload the tarfile to upstream/)
