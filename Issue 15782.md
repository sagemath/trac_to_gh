*sigh*

That's the best I can do, and I am not proud of it `^^;`

P.S. : You are the one at fault, actually. Who the hell computes connected components on digraphs ? It does not make any sense ! `:-P`

LGTM. Thanks Nathann.

It came up with Dynkin diagrams (which slightly abuses `DiGraph`) and connected components correspond to irreducible types.
