You make many edits like this:

```
I am not sure if this improves readability of the code. The change of the positions of `and` is okay, but the alignment of `==` in the original code looks nice. The alignment of `==` is clearly intended by the author, and I think we should respect that.

Let's hear more opinions from others.
