You make many edits like this:

```diff
-    if (v == (q**d - 1)*((q**d)//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1)             and
-        k == q*(q**(d-1) - 1)*((q**(d-1))//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1)   and
-        l == q*q*(q**(d-2)-1)*((q**(d-2))//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1) + q - 1):
+    if (v == (q**d - 1)*((q**d)//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1) and
+            k == q*(q**(d-1) - 1)*((q**(d-1))//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1) and
+            l == q*q*(q**(d-2)-1)*((q**(d-2))//(p**t) + 1)//(q - 1) + q - 1):
         from sage.graphs.generators.classical_geometries import UnitaryPolarGraph
```

I am not sure if this improves readability of the code. The change of the positions of `and` is okay, but the alignment of `==` in the original code looks nice. The alignment of `==` is clearly intended by the author, and I think we should respect that.

Let's hear more opinions from others.

PEP8 allows for different conventions with how multiple lines of a conditional are done. I am not convinced that the original author intended for the `==` to be aligned but it is just a byproduct of PEP8 `if` statement alignment. Since David is the one mostly reading and working with this code, I think we should defer to his choice of style (in particular, as he tries to make this section of the code uniform).
