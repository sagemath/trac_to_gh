# Issue 21135: Move Pynac interface to src/sage/libs/pynac

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21372

Original creator: jdemeyer

The directory `src/sage/symbolic` contains a mixture of modules which just define the Pynac interface and modules which implement the Sage symbolics.

This ticket moves all Pynac stuff to `src/sage/libs/pynac`.
