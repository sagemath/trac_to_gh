I did those test about one year ago [https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/30](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/30) so some things have probably changed a little bit but I expect you'll have to patch sage.

```

by the way, MPFI 1.5.0 fixes a limitation to 1000 characters in `mpfi_set_str`, which can be
demonstrated by the following test:

```
sage: R = RealIntervalField(53)
sage: R("1" * 1000)
1.111111111111112?e999
```

which failed previously. Maybe add a test for that?

The issues are `+0.0` versus `-0.0`, and also 1/0 which now gives `[-Inf, +Inf]`

there is one important change in MPFI 1.5.0 which might cause the failures: `mpfi_set_ui` on
input 0 gives `[+0.0,-0.0]` instead of `[+0.0,+0.0]` previously. I will ask upstream why:

```
sage: R=RealIntervalField(53)
sage: a=R(0)
sage: a.lower(), a.upper()
(0.000000000000000, -0.000000000000000)

More annoying is the following, which I believe is a bug in MPFI 1.5.0:

```
sage: a=R(infinity)
sage: a.lower(), a.upper()
(+infinity, +infinity)
sage: b=1/a
sage: b.lower(), b.upper()
(0.000000000000000, -0.000000000000000)

(I would expect `b=[+0.0,+0.0]`.)

I see in `real_mpfi.pyx` that other similar tests are failing and were rewritten in a
different way:

```
sage: R = RealIntervalField(4000)
sage: s = 1/R(3)
sage: t = loads(dumps(s))
sage: (t.upper(), t.lower()) == (s.upper(), s.lower())

Indeed `t==s` fails:

```
sage: t == s
False
```

Should I also rewrite the 2 failing tests like this? What is the reason for the failures?

You have to tell hg to remove them, just removing them with "rm" is not enough. 

```
 hg addremove

will do the trick then you can commit and make the spkg.
As mentioned above I would also like you to add a section to spkg-install that runs "make check" if SAGE_CHECK is set to yes.

I'm currently properly rebuilding the spkg (for 1.5.0).

I see that in Mike package, he got rid of the previous patch for cygwin.

I guess it has been merged upstream. Anyway, I'll document it in SPKG.txt when I find a ref, remove src/configure.ac from tracked files and delete patches directory, unless someone has an objection.

If v1.5.1 happens to get released, I'll just use it instead of 1.5.

Sorry I have fallen of the face of the internet in the past few days (not quite literally but almost). If there is a bit of time the test suite pass on power7 in a sage setting but with the following messages:

```
PASS: tinit
PASS: tinit_set
Warning: reverted endpoints line 21
Warning: reverted endpoints line 22
Warning: reverted endpoints line 23
Warning: reverted endpoints line 26
Warning: reverted endpoints line 30
Warning: reverted endpoints line 37
Warning: reverted endpoints line 38
PASS: tintersect
```

and

```
PASS: tsech
PASS: tset
Warning: reverted endpoints line 11
Warning: reverted endpoints line 12
Warning: reverted endpoints line 13
Warning: reverted endpoints line 14
Warning: reverted endpoints line 15
PASS: tset_d
```

Not sure if it can have an impact on some sage use or not.

> Not sure if it can have an impact on some sage use or not.

I reported the same warnings to the MPFI developers when 1.5.0 came out
(http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/mpfi-users/2011-May/000023.html)
but got no feedback. I will ask them again.

Jeroen, what do you get for the following?

```
sage: (RealField(2000)(-19/3).gamma() - RealIntervalField(1000)(-19/3).gamma())
```


My guess is that this problem is due to the one mentioned in comment [comment:9],
which is a bug already present in Sage, and thus separate from this ticket (however
I don't know why the doctest worked before...)

strange, with 4.8 just compiled on a Core2 under Ubuntu 10.10 I get:

```

tarte% ./sage

sage: RealIntervalField(53)(-1) > RR(1)
False

Francois,

no, I didn't use #11666. Can anybody reproduce the problem I have (cf #12353)?
Anyway I believe this is independent from this ticket, since it already happened before
(e.g., in Sage 4.7.2). Thus it should not prevent a positive review, if this is the only
remaining issue, and we should solve #12353 independently.

In `spkg-install`, you should `unset RM` as old Sage versions set `RM=rm` which breaks `libtool`.  For example, when upgrading from sage-4.5.3:

```
/bin/bash ../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link gcc  -O2 -g -fPIC  -L/mnt/usb1/scratch/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade/build/sage-4.5.3-5.0.beta5/local/lib -L/mnt/usb1/scratch/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade/build/sage-4.5.3-5.0.beta5/local/lib  -o libmpfi.la -rpath /mnt/usb1/scratch/buildbot/sage/sage-1/sage_upgrade/build/sage-4.5.3-5.0.beta5/local/lib abs.lo acos.lo acosh.lo add.lo add_d.lo add_fr.lo add_q.lo add_si.lo add_ui.lo add_z.lo alea.lo asin.lo asinh.lo atan2.lo atan.lo atanh.lo bisect.lo blow.lo cbrt.lo clear.lo cmp.lo cmp_sym_pi.lo constants.lo cos.lo cosh.lo csc.lo csch.lo cot.lo coth.lo d_div.lo d_sub.lo diam.lo div.lo div_2exp.lo div_2si.lo div_2ui.lo div_d.lo div_fr.lo div_q.lo div_si.lo div_ui.lo div_z.lo error.lo exp.lo exp2.lo expm1.lo fr_div.lo fr_sub.lo get_endpoints.lo get_fr.lo get_d.lo get_prec.lo get_version.lo has_zero.lo hypot.lo increase.lo init.lo intersect.lo interv_d.lo interv_fr.lo interv_q.lo interv_si.lo interv_ui.lo interv_z.lo inp_str.lo inv.lo is_empty.lo is_inside.lo log.lo log10.lo log1p.lo log2.lo mag.lo mid.lo mig.lo mul.lo mul_2exp.lo mul_2si.lo mul_2ui.lo mul_d.lo mul_fr.lo mul_q.lo mul_si.lo mul_ui.lo mul_z.lo neg.lo out_str.lo predicates.lo print_binary.lo put.lo put_d.lo put_fr.lo put_q.lo put_si.lo put_ui.lo put_z.lo q_div.lo q_sub.lo quadrant.lo revert_if_needed.lo round_prec.lo sec.lo sech.lo set.lo set_d.lo set_fr.lo set_prec.lo set_q.lo set_si.lo set_str.lo set_ui.lo set_z.lo si_div.lo si_sub.lo sign.lo sin.lo sinh.lo sqr.lo sqrt.lo sub.lo sub_d.lo sub_fr.lo sub_q.lo sub_si.lo sub_ui.lo sub_z.lo swap.lo tan.lo tanh.lo ui_div.lo ui_sub.lo union.lo urandom.lo z_div.lo z_sub.lo  -lmpfr -lgmp
