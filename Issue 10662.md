Keywords: isogeny class

The method isogeny_class() for elliptic curves over Q currently computes isogenies of prime degree between the curves in the class but then discards them.

This patch adds a parameter return_maps (boolean, default False) which is True also returns a matrix of the isogenies of prime degree (only) between the curves in the class.

When isogeny composition is implemented it will be possible to enhance this further and return a complete matrix of isogenies between any two curves in the class.  But this is already useful, for example to map generaotrs for one curve to the other curves in the class.  This is why I implemented it.

All tests passed, including references. And the code does what it the description is it should.

Thanks, Gagan!  I'll send you -- or perhaps upload to trac -- my Sage scripts for computing all the tables from Table 1, which rely on this.

There is a small problem with the documentation:

```
sage-4.7.alpha2/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_rational_field.py:docstring of sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_rational_field.EllipticCurve_rational_field.isogeny_class:20: (WARNING/2) Inline literal start-string without end-string.
```

OK, I am fixing that right now.

If you're finished, please put back positive_review yourself.

Sorry to bother again, but you should change the commit message of the patch such that the first line mentions the ticket number.  Use `hg qrefresh -e` for that.
