# Issue 19599: expansion of zeta using stieltjes-constants

Issue created by migration from Trac.

With the implementation of Stieltjes-constants from #19834 the expansion of the zeta-function can be improved to something like


```
sage: zeta(s).series(s==1)
1/(s-1) + euler_gamma - stieltjes(1)/2 * (s-1) + stieltjes(2)/6 * (s-1)^2  + ...
```


(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stieltjes_constants).

I suppose that---given the stieltjes-function is implemented in pynac---this only requires a change in the `zeta1_series` function [in pynac](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/07fca518724eabb875610b548d73ab52c7e70740/ginac/inifcns_nstdsums.cpp#L3795).

I think I can adapt this and make a pull request on github; at least if there is a stieltjes-function.

Yes. Dependency is set. This ticket would then just add doctesting of the expansion.

I've created a pull request [here](https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/122). Assuming this gets merged into pynac, the doctest here:
   https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/functions/transcendental.py#L81-L82
will fail and has to be removed in the ticket where pynac is updated.

This ticket here would then add the respective doctest of the form


```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 4)
1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma) + (-1/2*stieltjes(1))*(x - 1) + (1/6*stieltjes(2))*(x - 1)^2 + (-1/24*stieltjes(3))*(x - 1)^3 + Order((x - 1)^4)
```


Or do you suggest a different procedure?

It's fine. Maybe add one of the examples I just asked about in the pull requests.

With the changes I get this, correct?

```
sage -t src/sage/functions/transcendental.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/functions/transcendental.py", line 81, in sage.functions.transcendental.Function_zeta.__init__
Failed example:
    zeta(x).series(x==1, 1)
Expected:
    1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma + log(2) + log(pi) + 2*zetaderiv(1, 0)) + Order(x - 1)
Got:
    1*(x - 1)^(-1) + (euler_gamma) + Order(x - 1)
**********************************************************************
```

Exactly, that is the doctest I mentioned above.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I've adapted the documentation of `zeta(s)` in order to reflect the special expansion at `s==1`; everything else has already happened on other tickets. :-)
