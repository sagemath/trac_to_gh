# Issue 33671: Adding A New S-box

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33908

Keywords: crypto, S-box

Hello all,

I am creating this ticket to add a new S-box to the boxes package. More precisely, I aim at adding the S-box of a new block cipher named WARP to `src/sage/crypto/sboxes.py`.

This S-box which is the same as `Midori_Sb0` is as follows:

``
[0xc,0xa,0xd,0x3,0xe,0xb,0xf,0x7,0x8,0x9,0x1,0x5,0x0,0x2,0x4,0x6]
``

Replying to [comment:2 gh-hadipourh]:

To this end, it is sufficient to add the following command in `src/sage/crypto/sboxes.py`, e.g., between lines 1574-1575:


```
WARP = Midori_Sb0
```


Moreover, modify line 95 as follows:


```
- Midori_Sb0 (MANTIS, CRAFT, WARP), Midori_Sb1 ([BBISHAR2015]_)
```
