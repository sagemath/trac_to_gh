Please have a look, the branch is up and accessible.
The main objective of Ear Decomposition is to decompose the graph into cycles and chains that can be used to study properties of graph.

Jens algorithm:
1. Construct a depth-first search (dfs) spanning tree T of G ;
2. Traverse in Spanning Tree using G-T non-tree edges.

Potential Applications:
1. A graph G is biconnected if and only if it has an open ear decomposition.
2. A graph G is factor-critical if and only if G has an odd ear decomposition.
3. Verification to check if graph is 2-edge connected.


P.S : For the first step, we not only need tree but also some extra information which will be used in Tree traversal because of this I didn't use the existing DFS function and created my own.

Please let me know what more I can do to improve the code performance.

Welcome to Sagemath and thank you for this contribution.

There is no need to add a new file. This method should be inside `graph.py`.

Note that you don't need a class. You can define local methods inside a method like:

```
def my_function(G):
    def DFS(G, u):
        some code

    for u in G:
        DFS(G, u)
```

The local method can access local data list/dict, etc.

Some (unordered) comments.

- Please use the same indentation style than for other methods.

- in the name of variables: `vertice` -> `vertices`

- instead of `visited_vertice` you could name this dictionary `seen`. A matter of choice.
- `traverse_visited_vertice` could simply be `traversed` ?
- why using a list for `count` ? it's only an integer, right ? If I understand well, you use it to store in `value` the index of vertex v in the list `time_of_visit`, i.e., the order in which vertices are visited by DFS. So, we have:

```
value = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(time_of_visit)}
```


- instead of `time_of_visit`, you could use `order` of `dfs_order`. Could be (at least for me) easier to understand, especially since `time_of_visit[4]` is a vertex, not a time.

- why are you introducing variable `graph` instead of using `self` ?

- `n = graph.num_verts()` -> `n = self.order()`  I prefer this way, but both are working. Also, I'm not sure you really need the extra variable `n`, but it's a detail.

- since `graph.py` is for undirected graphs only, you can remove `if graph.is_directed(): raise ValueError("Graph must be undirected")`

- `if not graph.is_connected():` why ? can't we decompose the connected components of the graph ?

- `if(n<3):` -> `if n < 3:`

- `Please input a undirected connected graph with number of vertices > 2` -> `ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3` could be better. 

- `vertices = graph.get_vertices().keys()` -> `vertices = graph.vertices()` is the correct method. 

- the only interest of the `DFS` method is to record the parent of a vertex in a DFS order. If so, please add it in the description of the DFS method.

- when you write comments like `#make v are `, please add a space after `#`. `# make v are` is easier to read.

- I'm not sure to understand method `traverse`. Please add description.
- In the `while True` loop, you should start by `chain.append(pointer)`. No need to have it 3 times since you do it in all cases.
- why using the term `pointer` ?

- `for i in range(n):` -> `for u in time_of_visit:` 


I understand that I'm asking a lot of modifications, and I will ask for more, but it is very important to have an easy to read code, so that others can go inside an correct/improve parts if needed.

graph gives more readability, now onwards I will use self to access input graph.  \\

I thought I will be using number of vertices value very often so I stored it in a variable, instead of calling  graph.num_verts() but now it's of no use. \\

Yes graph.py is for undirected graphs, it's mentioned at the top, I have updated the code.

Yes we can do it, updated.

`graph.vertices()` will return a dict \\
`{'11': None, '10': None, '12': None, '1': None, '0': None, '3': None, '2': None, '5': None, '4': None, '7': None, '6': None, '9': None, '8': None}` \\

Should not since in graph.py, the methods are for Graph, and so not directed. It's different in `generic_graph.py` of course.

Read carefully what I wrote.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.vertices()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sage: print G.get_vertices()
{0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None, 5: None, 6: None, 7: None, 8: None, 9: None}
```

and in a loop it's better to use `G.vertex_iterator()`, `G.neighbor_iterator(u)`, `G.edge_iterator()`, etc. to avoid building the list before iterating on it.

Quick comments before going to a meeting :(

- the test `if(pointer==start):` is useless due to previous test `if(traversed[pointer])`

- in if statements, don't add (..). It's not needed when there is a unique condition.

- in the `for v in vertices:` loop, I fear that if the graph is not connected, you might visit again all previously treated components. Please check. May be you have to initialize some variables locally (i.e., not seen) to work only on the connected component.

Yes, you are correct, actually, in the algorithm, it's mention that traverses till you find start vertex or a visited vertex. As I am marking start as visited at first step, there is no use of `if(pointer==start):`. 
> 
> - in if statements, don't add (..). It's not needed when there is a unique condition.
Sure

> - in the `for v in vertices:` loop, I fear that if the graph is not connected, you might visit again all previously treated components. Please check. May be you have to initialize some variables locally (i.e., not seen) to work only on the connected component.
That case is taken care by seen list `if not seen[v]:`. \\
Let us suppose we have 2 connected components with 5 vertices in each component.\\
Component 1 = `[1,2,3,4,5]` \\
Component 2 = `[6,7,8,9,10]` \\
When first DFS(1) is run it will visit 4 vertices and mark it as seen .i.e `[1,2,3,4,5]`. So those 5 vertices can't be used again to call `DFS(v)`. \\
When vertice 6 comes it will call DFS(6), which will visit remaining 4 vertices and mark it as seen.\\
By this, all the vertices and connected components are covered, with extra cost(`if not seen[v]`), running on all vertices. i.e. `for v in vertices` \\
P.S: seen is not reinitialized after DFS call.

Indentation: in general, we use 4 spaces for the indentation. Please update the code accordingly.

I propose some modifications in the DFS method. For instance using an iterator over the neighbors, etc.

```
def DFS(v):
    """
    Depth first search step from vertex v. 
    """
    seen[v] = True
    dfs_order.append(v)
        
    # Explore the neighbors of v
    for u in self.neighbor_iterator(v):
        if not seen[u]:
            # Set the parent of u in DFS tree as v and continue exploration
            parent[u] = v
            DFS(u)
```


in method `traverse`:
- you can do `chain = [start]`
- `if(traversed[pointer]):` -> `if traversed[pointer]:`

You use a dictionary for seen and for traversed. This is fine. Note however that you could use sets instead (not list). That is, testing `u in seen` or `seen[u]` is the same, and one should be as fast as the other. The advantage of using sets is that you don't need to initialize them (a very minor speed up). You then have to use `seen.add(u)` instead of `seen[u] = True`.

You initialize `parent[vertices[0]] = -1`. This is not a good idea since `-1` could be a vertex.

```
sage: G = Graph([(-1, -2)])
sage: -1 in G
True
```

You can either initialize the parent to itself or to `None`.

The next step will be to polish the documentation of the method, the examples and the tests.
For instance:
- `This module implements the function for computing the Ear Decomposition of undirected graphs.` -> `Return the Ear decomposition of the graph`
- Then, with a blank line separation, it is important to add explanation of what is ear decomposition.
- the terms input, output, examples should be capitalized (see other methods)
- Since the method can raise errors, we must have specific doctests for that  (see other methods)

I don't have any knowledge about doctests, currently, I am going through sage doc http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/doctesting.html, please let me know if any other better document is available for doctests.

`parent[vertices[0]] = None` \\
As first non-tree edge will be from first `vertices[0]` and in the next step `traversed.add(start)` it will be marked as traversed, it doesn't matter whether its parent value is initialized or not as its parent value won't be used.

Definition, Wikipedia link and Reference is added.

Doctests:
Example1: g is simple undirected Graph. \\
Example2: g is disconnected graph with one component order < 3 \\
Example3: g is disconnected graph with 2 components, both components order > 3. \\
Example4: G is Looped multi-graph on 7 vertices and H is Graph on 7 vertices, both generates the same result. \\
Example5: g is disconnected graph with vertices as strings, not as numbers. \\
Example6: g is an empty graph. \\

It's a non connected graph, in which one component is will have one edge i.e 12-13(12 & 13 are vertices).
When we do ear decomposition 12-13 vertices won't be available in any of the chains as 12-13 is a tree edge.

I think you are in 90 columns format. The counting includes the white spaces at the left.
The same must be done for input, etc.

First, this is a connected graph but not a biconnected graph.
I suggest using simpler examples like this for non connected graphs

```
sage: g = graphs.CycleGraph(3) + graphs.CycleGraph(4)
```

or this for connected but not biconnected

```
sage: g = graphs.BullGraph()
```

or for multigraph with a loop

```
sage: g = graphs.BullGraph()
sage: g.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: g.add_edges(g.edges())
sage: g.allow_loops(True)
sage: u = g.random_vertex()
sage: g.add_edge(u, u)
```

Can you clarify the definition for non connected graphs: should the method return a decomposition of each connected component or [] ? in particular, what if a connected component is of order < 3 since the ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order >= 3 ?

I'm not aware of existing algorithms (if any). If an algorithm has already been proposed, we can add it. If not, we can skip this question.

The graphs(order < 3) will have either isolated single node which plays no role in decomposition or 2 nodes with multiple edges in between them which is same as `v1 - v2` as only one edge is present no cycle or chain is possible.
To be more formal, if an undirected graph has n-1 edges or no non-tree edges left after DFS traversal then ear decomposition of such graph/components will be empty.

I turned the ticket to "needs review". Otherwise I will never be able to give positive review ;)

- `presented in [Sch2013].` -> `presented in [Sch2013]_.`  This is the way to cite a reference with sphynx.

- `outer plananr` -> `outer planar`

- `g = g = graphs.CubeGraph(2)` remove one of the `g = `

- `Ear decomposition of a disconnected graph of order 17::` again, this graph IS connected but not biconnected. If the goal of this test is to show the behavior on a connected graph with 2 biconnected blocks, a simpler example (i.e., that one can understand without plotting the graph etc.) could be

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_cycle([0,1,2])
sage: G.add_edge(0,3)
sage: G.add_cycle([3,4,5,6])
```


- add an empty line after `TESTS::`

- `g=Graph([])` -> `g = Graph()`  and no need for the line `sage: g`, we know it's the empty graph.

- `ValueError("Ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3.")` -> `ValueError("ear decomposition is defined for graphs of order at least 3")` no capital letter at the beginning of the message, and no point at the end. It's not unified in Sagemath, but it will slowly be modified.

- `self.order()<3` -> `self.order() < 3`   It's a coding recommendation (PEP...).


When at check the branch [u/saiharsh/EarDecomposition](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/diff?id2=9bf9f05f1f56d2e75439c2d2169459c3dfc2c0a3&id=c5c8fcab58e8c504cfc839e393ab28cb5bc40dc7), I see

Please carefully check your code before pushing a commit.
- `Ear decomposition of a disconnected graph of order 17::` but the example is different. The text could be `Ear decomposition of a connected but not biconnected graph::`

I have additional comments:
- `Ear decomposition of multigraph(g) is same as ear decomposition on simple graph(g)::` could be `The ear decomposition of a multigraph with loops is the same as the ear decomposition of the underlying simple graph::`

- Instead of 

```
sage: h = copy(g)
sage: h.allow_multiple_edges(False)
sage: h.allow_loops(False)
```

  you can use `sage: h = g.to_simple()`

- When I checkout your code, I see:

Could you please say why it's saying, build failed on patchbot, where I am able to successfully build in my system.

When I see build failed log of patchbot,

Sage build/upgrade complete! \\
fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory

I found that it's able to build but can't read some files. 

Could you please have a look and please let me know, is there any issue from my side?

The problem is independent from your patch.

Concerning your ticket.
- there are remaining trailing white spaces, for instance at the end of line `of the path may coincide (i.e., form a cycle), but where otherwise no `. Please check carefully.

- line `This method implements the linear time algorithm presented in [Sch2013]_.` must be break since it ends on column 81.

- in the description of the `traverse` method, you must add a space after `G-T`.

I saw that the last version of networkx contains `chain_decomposition` which should be similar to this algorithm. Unfortunately we don't have the last version in sagemath so we can't do the comparison.

most likely you were doing `git commit -a` - i.e. commit all the changes and all the new files - and thus you committed too much.
Great care must be exercised while using `-a` switch,
Yes, sometimes it is handy, but sometimes it leads to such SNAFU's.
