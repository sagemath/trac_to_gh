That's a hell of a project!

At some point, when linear algebra works in combinatorial free modules, I'll want (and probably make) the Lie algebra of primitives of a Hopf algebra.

Okay, here's the current version of the patch for reference for those don't want to get/use the combinat queue. It does about 80% or so of the functionality I want, but it probably could use some restructuring. It's also missing a lot of documentation (most importantly doctests). Here's what's done and (mostly) working:

- Free Lie algebras in the Hall basis
- The Lyndon basis for the free Lie algebra
- Abelian Lie algebras
- Lie algebras from an associative algebra
- Lie algebras from structure coefficients
- Finite type Lie algebras
  - As matrices for types ABCD
  - In the Chevalley basis
- **gl**<sub>n</sub>
- The Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices
- The Lie algebra of upper triangular matrices
- Untwisted affine Lie algebras constructed from a finite type
- Untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (i.e. the above and the Lie derivative) [done]
- Universal enveloping algebras
- Kac-Moody algebras based only on a (generalized) Cartan matrix
- LLT basis and Fock spaces for U<sub>q</sub>(**sl**<sub>n</sub>) [done]
- PBW(-type) bases of universal enveloping algebra (quantum group) [done for Lie algebras up to abstracting internal structure]
- canonical bases of quantum groups [90% done]
- the Heisenberg Lie algebras and some other misc examples
- quotient, sub, and direct sum Lie algebras and Lie algebra ideals [doesn't always seem to reduce properly]

Everything else:

- twisted affine Lie and Kac-Moody algebras via loop groups/diagram automorphims [I want to do this, but haven't started and might push to a later ticket]
- the Goodman and Wenzl modified LLT algorithm [haven't started yet]
- polynomial representations for **sl**<sub>n</sub> [doesn't give the correct results]
- implementation of quantum groups [65% done]
- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>) [I would need to understand Hall algebras better to do this]
- **su**<sub>n</sub> [possibly to be dropped as the Sage infrastructure does not seem to be there]
- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (where it makes sense) [0% done, likely to be dropped]
