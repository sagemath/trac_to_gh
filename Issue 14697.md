Other (poosible) additions:

- LLT basis and Fock spaces for U<sub>q</sub>(*sl*<sub>n</sub>) (arbitrary *g*?)
- implementation of the quantum group
- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>)
- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (where it makes sense)
- PBW(-type) bases of universal enveloping algebra (quantum group)
- canonical bases of quantum groups

That's a hell of a project!

At some point, when linear algebra works in combinatorial free modules, I'll want (and probably make) the Lie algebra of primitives of a Hopf algebra.

I'm currently setting #14898 as a dependency since that will likely be done before this patch and because they should play together.

For defining the action on Fock space needs #15151.

To do PBW(-type) bases, I'll need #15289.

Okay, here's the current version of the patch for reference for those don't want to get/use the combinat queue. It does about 80% or so of the functionality I want, but it probably could use some restructuring. It's also missing a lot of documentation (most importantly doctests). Here's what's done and (mostly) working:

- Free Lie algebras in the Hall basis
- The Lyndon basis for the free Lie algebra
- Abelian Lie algebras
- Lie algebras from an associative algebra
- Lie algebras from structure coefficients
- Finite type Lie algebras
  - As matrices for types ABCD
  - In the Chevalley basis
- *gl*<sub>n</sub>
- The Lie algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices
- The Lie algebra of upper triangular matrices
- Untwisted affine Lie algebras constructed from a finite type
- Untwisted affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras (i.e. the above and the Lie derivative) [done]
- Universal enveloping algebras
- Kac-Moody algebras based only on a (generalized) Cartan matrix
- LLT basis and Fock spaces for U<sub>q</sub>(*sl*<sub>n</sub>) [done]
- PBW(-type) bases of universal enveloping algebra (quantum group) [done for Lie algebras up to abstracting internal structure]
- canonical bases of quantum groups [90% done]
- the Heisenberg Lie algebras and some other misc examples
- quotient, sub, and direct sum Lie algebras and Lie algebra ideals [doesn't always seem to reduce properly]

Everything else:

- twisted affine Lie and Kac-Moody algebras via loop groups/diagram automorphims [I want to do this, but haven't started and might push to a later ticket]
- the Goodman and Wenzl modified LLT algorithm [haven't started yet]
- polynomial representations for *sl*<sub>n</sub> [doesn't give the correct results]
- implementation of quantum groups [65% done]
- connection between the quantum group and the Hall algebra (coming from representations of a quiver over F<sub>q</sub>) [I would need to understand Hall algebras better to do this]
- *su*<sub>n</sub> [possibly to be dropped as the Sage infrastructure does not seem to be there]
- recovery of Lie group from Lie algebra (where it makes sense) [0% done, likely to be dropped]

You might find [this link](http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?p=9584385) interesting and relevant.  Apparently this person implemented quite a bit...

Thanks. That has the branching rules and operations on the algebras themselves, which is useful, than doing computations within them.

Also as a reference for myself: http://coropa.sourceforge.net/

Changing type from enhancement to task.

I've separated out Fock space into #15508. More splittings to come.

I'd also like to get Lie cohomology and connections with the exterior algebra (#15300) and De Rahm cohomology done as well.

FYI - #16819 has been split off and is ready for review.

Lie algebra (co)homology is done in #22883. It is not the most efficient implementation and doesn't seem work very well for Lie algebras of dimension larger than 10 due to the amount of information needed to be computed (i.e., large dimensional vector spaces).

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-05-20 07:29:36

#23037 adds a little bit more to the representation theory in Sage. Good follow-ups will include trivial, adjoint, and tensor product representations for Lie algebras.

update milestone 8.3 -> 8.4

Comment by @ehaka created at 2018-08-17 07:41:03

Added a subsection of tickets related to various constructions related to nilpotent Lie algebras. I have some existing implementations for these in a codebase that needs to be cleaned up and refactored in order to be imported to Sage.
