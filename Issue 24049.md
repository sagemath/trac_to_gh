This will be one of many tickets I will be opening for miscellaneous minor fixes to specific modules.

In some cases I'll keep these more "thematic" in which case they might span multiple modules, but in other cases it is simpler to submit one module at a time for minor fixes.

See the commit messages for more details about individual fixes.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24286

1. In `src/sage/repl/load.py`, some doctests are marked `# py2` for no good reason.

2. Why use `tmp_filename` here?

```
        sage: fname = tmp_filename(ext='.py')
        sage: fullpath = os.path.join(t_dir, fname)
        sage: with open(fullpath, 'w') as f:
        ....:     _ = f.write("print(37 * 3)")
```

The old code did not use `tmp_filename`. The new code does. I see no reason for that change, so it needs to be justified.
