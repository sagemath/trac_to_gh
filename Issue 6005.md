```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1) 
sage: i.imag()
1
```


The above is hundreds of times slower than i.real().  That needs to be fixed.

it's because of this line

Now 


```
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: timeit("i.imag()")
625 loops, best of 3: 9.73 Âµs per loop
```

The two patches cause doctest failures in one file:

This was merged in as part of #5930. 

It was folded into one of those patches: http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/diff/d7533ae4895e/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element_quadratic.pyx
