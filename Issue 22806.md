Maybe you would be interested in having a look at #12560 ? I have done my best, but it still needs some care from an expert in padics and C/cython.

Looks great!

* p is allowed to be larger than an unsigned long.  Presumably you should fall back on the non-optimized implementation then (the precision won't be large in this case, so it shouldn't really matter much).

* I think that fixed modulus logs should still work even when `a` is not invertible, in analogy with `a//p` working.

* It would be good to use `sig_malloc` and `sig_free` from `cysignals/memory.pxd`, but I don't know exactly how to achieve this in a C file.

* It would be good to have additional tests.  In particular, maybe have an `algorithm` keyword that allows falling back to the default implementation of p-adic logs and compare.  Adding some `TestSuite` tests (by implementing `_test_log` for example; see `padic_generic.pyx`) would also be good, checking that `log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)` for example.

* I should be fairly responsive for the next 9 days or so, since I'm at a Sage Days then working with Julian on p-adics.  It would be cool to get this positively reviewed soon!

Ok, done.
But I am then wondering about other memory allocations (required by gmp). Are there correctly handled?

Fine.

Btw, what happens exactly when the computation is interrupted by `KeyboardInterrupt`. Is the memory allocated by the function automatically free? Or should we handle this?

In Cython, you can use a try/finally block and free inside the finally.  I think in this case we should just live with the possibility of a memory leak.",

I don't think it's automatically freed, but I don't know how to handle it in C.  In Cython, you can use a try/finally block and free inside the finally.  I think in this case we should just live with the possibility of a memory leak.
