This ticket provides a fast C implementation of the logarithm for elements of `\mathbb Z_p`. (Only capped relative precision is supported currently.)

The gain of speed is significant:


```
    sage: R = Zp(17, 2^15)
    sage: a = 1 + 17*R.random_element()

    sage: from sage.rings.padics.padic_generic_element import pAdicGenericElement
    sage: generic_log = pAdicGenericElement.log    # old version

    sage: for i in range(2,11):
    ....:     print 'At precision 2^%s:' % i
    ....:     timeit('b = generic_log(a,aprec=%s)' % 2^i)

I have just launched my patchbot on this ticket.

Maybe you would be interested in having a look at #12560 ? I have done my best, but it still needs some care from an expert in padics and C/cython.

Ok, I'll have a look.

Patch ready for review.

Note that I've changed the behaviour of log for fixed-modulus padics: when `a` is not invertible, `log(a)` now raises an error. The reason for this is that taking logarithm decreases the absolute precision for non-units (while the absolute precision is fixed in the parent in that case). Please argue if you don't agree :-).

I've improved a bit the algorithm (by making first the argument closer to 1 by raising - possibly several times - to the power p). New timings :


```
sage: for i in range(2,16):
....:     print 'At precision 2^%s:' % i
....:     R = Zp(17, prec=2^i)
....:     a = 1 + 17*R.random_element()
....:     timeit('b = a.log()')
....:     
At precision 2^2:
625 loops, best of 3: 5.51 µs per loop
At precision 2^3:
625 loops, best of 3: 7.83 µs per loop
At precision 2^4:
625 loops, best of 3: 11 µs per loop
At precision 2^5:
625 loops, best of 3: 13.6 µs per loop
At precision 2^6:
625 loops, best of 3: 21.9 µs per loop
At precision 2^7:
625 loops, best of 3: 40.5 µs per loop
At precision 2^8:
625 loops, best of 3: 88.7 µs per loop
At precision 2^9:
625 loops, best of 3: 184 µs per loop
At precision 2^10:
625 loops, best of 3: 526 µs per loop
At precision 2^11:
625 loops, best of 3: 1.57 ms per loop
At precision 2^12:
125 loops, best of 3: 4.59 ms per loop
At precision 2^13:
25 loops, best of 3: 13.2 ms per loop
At precision 2^14:
25 loops, best of 3: 38.3 ms per loop

Looks great!

* p is allowed to be larger than an unsigned long.  Presumably you should fall back on the non-optimized implementation then (the precision won't be large in this case, so it shouldn't really matter much).

* I think that fixed modulus logs should still work even when `a` is not invertible, in analogy with `a//p` working.

* It would be good to use `sig_malloc` and `sig_free` from `cysignals/memory.pxd`, but I don't know exactly how to achieve this in a C file.

* It would be good to have additional tests.  In particular, maybe have an `algorithm` keyword that allows falling back to the default implementation of p-adic logs and compare.  Adding some `TestSuite` tests (by implementing `_test_log` for example; see `padic_generic.pyx`) would also be good, checking that `log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)` for example.

* I should be fairly responsive for the next 9 days or so, since I'm at a Sage Days then working with Julian on p-adics.  It would be cool to get this positively reviewed soon!

Great! Thanks for your review!

For `sig_malloc` and `sig_free`, I also do not know how to use them in a C code.
Apart from that, I addressed all your requests.

Great.  Peter Bruin suggests the following for sig_malloc and sig_free:

 * Include cysignals/macros.h in your transcendentals.c file.  This might be as simple as `#include <cysignals/macros.h>`, but we're not sure.
 * Before your mallocs, call `sig_block()` and afterward, call `sig_unblock()`.  This will duplicate the effect of `sig_malloc` in `cysignals/memory.pxd`.

Ok, done.
But I am then wondering about other memory allocations (required by gmp). Are there correctly handled?

I don't think there is a problem here; Sage sets the malloc/realloc/free functions to be used by GMP to `sage_sig_malloc` etc. (see `sage/ext/memory.pyx`).  Actually, it could be an option for your code to use the same malloc as GMP does.

Fine.

Btw, what happens exactly when the computation is interrupted by `KeyboardInterrupt`. Is the memory allocated by the function automatically free? Or should we handle this?

I don't think it's automatically freed, but I don't know how to handle it in C.  In Cython, you can use a try/finally block and free inside the finally.  I think in this case we should just live with the possibility of a memory leak.

Changing keywords from "logarithm" to "logarithm, sd86.5".

I'm building it now to run tests.


---

Comment by roed created at 2017-06-09 00:43:14

I've run all tests. Xavier, if you're happy with my changes (fixing a typo and changing some TestSuites to not take forever), go ahead and set this to positive review.
