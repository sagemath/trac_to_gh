(from #31901#comment:19)

The assumptions should not be global but chart-wise.

There is already a context manager `assuming`. We could create it at initialization and invoke it using `with` whenever computations are done with this chart.

We go through a new method `assuming` of `CalculusMethod` that dispatches in the same way as the `simplify` method does.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32120

Another way could be to write a own class for the variables of a chart instead of seeing them as pure symbolic expressions. That could also solve the problem described in #30232.

I don't think that would help - assumptions are really per chart, not per variable; and in the end, they do need to be communicated to the symbolic engine.

Replying to [comment:5 mkoeppe]:
> not per variable; and in the end, they do need to be communicated to the symbolic engine.

That is indeed true.

Related to the discussion in #30232, perhaps it makes sense to introduce rings of expressions under symbolic assumptions. Simplifying an expression using an additional assumption would then be a coercion!
