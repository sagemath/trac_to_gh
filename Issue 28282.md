Thanks for these improvements in the code.

A quick question: what is the motivation for returning a copy of the zero element of the parent instead of the zero element itself? Returning the zero element is certainly faster. In which case wouldn't it be safe? Moreover in some cases (scalar fields) the zero element is updated when a new chart is added, which is not the case of the copy.

The method `zero()` of the parent is cached. It might happen that this zero element could be manipulated after some computation returning zero (due to some user written algorithm). I tried to avoid that. Do you think this scenario is too unlikely? If so, we can give up the copies.

> Moreover in some cases (scalar fields) the zero element is updated when a new chart is added, which is not the case of the copy.

Oh, I was not aware of that. However, a result of an algebraic operation has *always* been a very new instance, which knows only about the current charts and frames. The user should always be aware of that. At this stage, there is no difference to the previous code and it sounds fairly consistent to me.

What do you think, which way is most convenient and user friendly?

Best regards,
Michael

The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to agree with you. Travis, do you have any thought about this?

Another remark: some of the proposed changes regarding scalar fields are actually not improvements but feature changes:

- the method `display()` without any argument currently displays the scalar field in all the top charts where the expression is known; you propose to change it to enforce the display in the greatest (sub)charts where the expression can be computed, even if they are not top charts. I'm not sure to agree with that: in the current setting, the output of `display()` is sufficient to fully characterize the scalar field (no loss of information); the extension you propose adds extra computations and results in longer outputs, which can be cumbersome for complicated scalar fields. If the user would like to know the expression of the scalar field in such a subchart, he/her can get it anyway, by passing the chart as the argument of `display()`. 
- regarding the multiplication of scalar fields `f` and `g`, the LaTeX output is changed from `f g` to `f\cdot g`. Is this for aesthetic reasons only? Personaly I would prefer `f g`, which sounds more standard notation. Maybe the opinion of a third person (Travis?) would be helpful here.

In nearly every instance in Sage, elements are considered immutable and (algebraic) operations do produce new elements (but sometimes share information because they are treated as immutable objects and some of their parts do not change with such operations). Really there should not be any functional difference between the result of `P.zero()` and creating a new zero instance, and the cached object should be better as it should retain more intermediate computations (say, its values on different charts). If a computation is actually changing some fundamental data, then that is a bug. So I strongly believe you should be using `P.zero()` instead of creating a new zero instance.

-1 as that defeats the purpose.

If that fundamentally changes the zero from what it is intended to representation, which it sounds like you are saying it does (I am a bit out of my depth mathematically here), then that is a bug with the `set_restriction` method. This might a little better/easier for me to see with a more explicit example.

If there really is no other way out of this with keeping the cached behavior, then you have to manually copy the elements when creating the mixed forms.

Once a differential form is established and ready for further use, it shall be considered as immutable, right? When a mixed form is fed by these forms, `set_restriction` alters the as immutable seen forms, which should not happen due to your consideration.

Perhaps it is better to implement a mixed form as an own independent algebraic object which should be initialized in a similar way as differential forms. The components must be set individually anyway. What do you think?

The point is that tensor field objects (including scalar fields and differential forms) are not immutable, except for the zero element. They cannot be made immutable because, in general, they cannot be fully defined at their creation: they are defined "on the fly" by adding some piece of information like

```
sage: s.add_expr(1+x, chart=X)
sage: t[0,1] = 1+x
```

for a scalar field `s` and a tensor field `t`.

Things are different for the zero elements: they are fully defined at their creation and they should be immutable. This is not enforced though, and we have currently the following garbage in / garbage out  bugs:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: zv = M.vector_field_module().zero()
sage: zv.display()
zero = 0
sage: zv[0] = 1 + x  # this should not be allowed!
sage: zv.display()
zero = (x + 1) d/dx
sage: zv is M.vector_field_module().zero()  # ouch!
True
sage: zs = M.scalar_field_algebra().zero()
sage: zs.display()
zero: M --> R
   (x, y) |--> 0
sage: zs.set_expr(1 + x)  # this should not be allowed!
sage: zs.display()
zero: M --> R
   (x, y) |--> x + 1
sage: zs is M.scalar_field_algebra().zero()  # ouch!
True
```

The natural way to enforce the immutability of the zero element would be to subclass the element class. Unfortunately, this turns out to be impossible in Sage's !Parent/Element framework, cf. this [sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/tZW9T-AixBQ).


> However, I am not sure I understand why `set_restriction` is not useful anymore. What about if there are other forms?

`set_restriction` should handle properly the zero case: if some element is a zero element, then it should replace it by an ordinary object which equals to zero and apply the restriction to it, making it no longer equal to zero.

The `_is_zero` attribute changes whenever a component is changed or `bool` is used. So, I'd prefer something like

```

> Can you be more specific about the fact that this would not work?

Yes. In `tensorfield_module.py` the zero element is established by:


```
        resu = self._element_constructor_(name='zero', latex_name='0')
        for frame in self._domain._frames:
            if self._dest_map.restrict(frame._domain) == frame._dest_map:
                resu.add_comp(frame)
                # (since new components are initialized to zero)
```


But this raises an immediate error when using


```
if self is self.parent().zero():
    raise AssertionError("...")
```


in `add_comp`.

One can add the components from "behind". But using this method is contradictional in this case.

Thanks for provided example, with `add_comp` called on the zero element.

> Another idea would be, to move the preexisting code to an internal method called `_add_comp` and change everything internally with it. From outside then, you have to use the old `add_comp` method which ensures correct treatment and invokes `_add_comp` after some checking.

Another option would be to add the keyword argument `check=True` to `add_comp` and to use it as follows:

```
def add_comp(self, basis=None, check=True):
    if check and self is self.parent().zero():
        raise RuntimeError("...")
    ...
```

Then in internal code, like in the example of comment:62, one could call `add_comp` with `check=False`. 

That said, I would propose to move the secure manipulation of the zero element to another ticket, possibly investigating further the option of introducing a specific subclass (this would avoid having `if self is self.parent().zero()` cases everywhere).
