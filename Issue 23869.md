This is a stripped-down version of the patch in #22509, demonstrating the bare minimum functionality required to support staged installation via `DESTDIR`.  It does not add support for this to all packages as #22509 does.  That will require additional followups.

In particular, this supports passing a `SAGE_DESTDIR` variable to spkg build scripts.  In the case of packages installed with `make install`, this is passed to `make` as `DESTDIR=$SAGE_DESTDIR`.  Not all packages that use make support this (but most do).  For those that don't this is a no-op. The `sage-spkg` command then takes advantage of this by setting `$SAGE_DESTDIR` to a standard value before running the package build/install scripts.  It then uses the temporary install directory to generate a manifest for the package.  Currently this can be seen in action with the `patch` package (the only package currently using `sdh_make_install`).  With this patch applied:


```
$ ./sage -f patch
...
$ cat local/var/lib/sage/installed/patch-2.7.5
{
    "package_name": "patch",
    "package_version": "2.7.5",
    "install_date": "Wed Oct 25 14:32:16 UTC 2017",
    "system_uname": "Linux sage-docker 3.13.0-123-generic #172-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun 26 18:04:35 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux",
    "sage_version": "SageMath version 8.1.beta7, Release Date: 2017-10-03",
    "test_result": "",
    "files": [
        "bin/patch",
        "share/man/man1/patch.1"
    ]
}
```


The installed files are listed relative to `$SAGE_LOCAL`, and does not include empty directories (in a git-like manner).  This is because directories are not typically owned by a single package, only files.  In the rare case where an empty directory needs to be owned by a specific package, a placeholder file should be added to that directory (this is typical in some Linux distributions as well).

The same could be done easily for Python packages by having `sdh_pip_install` add `--root=${SAGE_DESTDIR}`, but currently that breaks a tiny set of Python packages whose build scripts do not fully support this kind of staged installation, so their case will be addressed separately.

}
```

I added the aforementioned tweaks.  It's likely others are needed, but these were the minimal fixes I needed for a successful build from scratch.

The one change that's a bit sketchy is the removal of the "sanity check" from patch's `spkg-install`.  I really don't think it's needed at all, but if we really wanted to keep it it would make more sense as a post-install step.

#22509 has a feature of allowing packages to include a `spkg-postinst` script that is run on the package after it's already been fully copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL`.  I left it out of this ticket to keep things simple, but I could add it back in, as it doesn't add very much complexity at all.

If it's the same as you mean to use, it's probably better not to try doing it at the same time...
