From a discussion on [sage-combinat-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-combinat-devel/-8d0a3AJYoQ/discussion):

Add a new marker for doctests, `# require failure`, which makes the test fail if the output is the same as the expected output and succeed otherwise.

See also #13278.

I have read the thread, but I don't understand the point. What's wrong with


```
sage: 2 + 2   # should be 4 if #56789 is fixed
5
```

or

```
sage: 2 + 2   # known bug: #56789
4
```

And this makes it actually almost useless:

```
Note that requiring failure is not possible if the test raises an exception
```


If we ever implement this, we must allow exceptions as failures.

When the result of the test is more complicated than one number (multiple lines for example), it's easier to delete a `#require failure` comment than fit the correct answer into a comment and then move it once it starts working.  It does seem like a fairly minor benefit though.

I've updated the patch to allow exceptions as failures.

Could you explain what exactly this tag is meant for in the ticket's description? The link to a sage-devel thread that you provide is an unrelated (french) message of Frederic Chapoton.

Thanks,

Oh. True, is only redirected me toward the last message of that thread. But it seems that people there were looking for a way to remember known bugs, while we have the more effective stopgaps for that.
