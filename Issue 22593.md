# Issue 22593: (x>17).plot() returns an expression

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: pelegm

Keywords: bool,expression,plot


```python
(x>17).plot()
```

returns an Expression rather than a Graphics object.  More specifically, it
returns an Expression with the representation

```
x |--> x > 17
```


Trying to plot this expression (plotting the output of a plot function seems unreasonable, still tried it since the output was an expression...) raised

```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):

See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx#L11481 and in particular

```
                else:
                    param = A[0]
                    try:
                        f = self._plot_fast_callable(param)
                    except NotImplementedError:
                        return self.function(param)
```

so this code has been in there for a very long time (since it was in calculus/calculus.py).  I'm not sure why it returns a function in those cases.  The question remains of what it _should_ return, since we don't really know in this case even if a one-d or two-d plot would be imagined.
