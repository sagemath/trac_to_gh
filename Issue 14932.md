There is a bug in the FreeAlgebra coercion when the algebra is over a field, and you are trying to coerce from something that can be coerced into that field:


```
sage: A.<x> = FreeAlgebra(ZZ)
sage: A(1)                                      # This works fine
1
sage: A.<x> = FreeAlgebra(CC)
sage: A(1)                                      # This raises an exception

 ...

NameError: global name 'F' is not defined
```

I'm adding #14898 as a dependency just to be safe (it may not be necessary).

Good catch and correct fix. I've reviewed the hg version.
