CC:  stumpc5 @tscrim @videlec @dimpase @rbeezer

Keywords: PermutationGroup, days93.51, gap

Currently, the iterator looks like this. 

```
def __iter__(self):

    from sage.sets.recursively_enumerated_set import RecursivelyEnumeratedSet
    return iter(RecursivelyEnumeratedSet(seeds=[self.one()],
                successors=lambda g: (g._mul_(h) for h in self.gens())))
```


Perhaps it would be faster to use a strong_generating_system to iterate through the group.

I added an alternative suggestion `__iter_alt__` in the patch. However, sometimes calculation the  strong_generating_system takes much longer than actually iterating with the standard iterator above. Here are some timing experiments:

```
sage: p = [(i,i+1) for i in range(1,601,2)]
sage: q = [tuple(range(1+i,601,3)) for i in range(3)]
sage: A = PermutationGroup([p,q])
sage: A.cardinality()

sage: time len(list(A))

sage: time len(list(A.__iter_alt__()))
CPU times: user 3.39 s, sys: 690 ms, total: 4.08 s
Wall time: 4.1 s
60000
sage: P = PermutationGroup(SymmetricGroup(10).gens())
sage: time len(list(P))

CPU times: user 3.64 s, sys: 144 ms, total: 3.79 s

```


Any suggestions? What are good other groups to do benchmarking?

You can probably get some more speed by doing the initial step in the `__iter__` function and then do the remaining steps with `SGS` being explicitly given. It is probably faster to also do

```sage
            S = SGS.pop()
            if not SGS:
                for g in S:
                    yield g
            else:
                for s in elements(self, SGS):
                    for g in S:
                        yield s._mul_(g)

This computation takes much less time in `gap` directly, I thus expect that doing

directly in gap rather than in sage would improve the iteration in this case drastically. (I just tried for a bit but failed. The code in gap directly is

done.

I also made some tests and think that the permutation group method `strong_generating_system` is much slower than necessary (see the above example where this algo is slower than the brute force). In particular, there is a lot of talking back and forth between sage and gap. Anyway, for my purposes, this is a non-issue. `@`Dima, do you know how to **easily** make this method fast?

Could you provide a code snippet in the above example of how to do that?

Because this provides a list of strong generators for the stabilizer chain, but not a list of coset reprs:


```
gap> P := Group([(1,2),(1,2,3,4)]);
Group([ (1,2), (1,2,3,4) ])
gap> S := StabChain(P);
<stabilizer chain record, Base [ 1, 2, 3 ], Orbit length 4, Size: 24>
gap> CosetsStabChain(S);
[ [ () ], [ (), (3,4) ], [ (), (2,4,3), (2,3,4) ], [ (), (1,4)(2,3), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4) ] ]
gap> StrongGeneratorsStabChain(S);
[ (3,4), (2,3,4), (1,2)(3,4), (1,4)(2,3) ]

Historically, little attention was paid to the problem at hand, and indeed, iteration over all the elements of a group G, rather than doing something more intelligent, is almost surely an indication of something done without enough thought. 

E.g., 

* would knowing the coset representatives of a subgroup H<G and generators for H suffice?
* would knowing the words in generators rather than permutations suffice?
* can an adavntage be taken of a short [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(group_theory)) for G?

Before comparing any of these functions, we should have a way to fast translate gap permutations to sage permutations. Otherwise, this would even much more so spoil the use of the gap function `Elements` which then results in all permutations to be translated from gap to sage.

Here are some preliminary timings for the Coxeter group of type `E7`:

In gap, the iteration needs 9.2 secs:

<permutation group with 7 generators>
gap> Length(Elements(P)); time;
2903040
9255
```

while in sage, it only takes 4.3 secs of which 0.7 secs are spend constructing the strong generating system:

```
sage: P = CoxeterGroup(["E",7], implementation="permutation")
sage: %time X = P.strong_generating_system(P.base())
CPU times: user 632 ms, sys: 71.6 ms, total: 703 ms
Wall time: 718 ms

sage: P = CoxeterGroup(["E",7], implementation="permutation")
sage: %time len(list(P.__iter_alt__()))
CPU times: user 4.11 s, sys: 208 ms, total: 4.32 s
Wall time: 4.34 s
2903040
```

So I expect this to go down below 4 sec if we speed the strong generating system.

Do you know that GAP actually has iterators?
With P as in comment 31:

```
gap> si:=IteratorStabChain(StabChain(P));
<iterator>
gap> l:=[];;
gap> for i in si do Add(l,i); od;

```

is about 30% faster than `Elements(P)` - the latter actually will also sort the elements, perhaps that's why.

Moreover, in `for i` loop about 60% of time is taken by `Add()`.
(I measured this by replacing `Add()` by a counter increment).

> I suspect it won't work correctly if SGS's elements are not involutions.

This is not correct if I understand it correctly. In particular, the elements in the SGS are usually not only involutions, for example

```
sage: S = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3)])
sage: S.strong_generating_system()
[[(), (1,2,3), (1,3,2)], [(), (2,3)], [()]]
```

and the SGS is **not** a generating set for the group itself.
Another example of a cyclic group is

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2,3,4)])
sage: for elt in P.__iter_alt__(): print elt
()
(1,4,3,2)
(1,3)(2,4)
(1,2,3,4)
```

and the stabilizer chain is trivial (i.e., the chain of cosets is a single coset of the trivial subgroup).

Sorry, I am slightly lost now in what you are asking -- let me try to answer anyway.

Let S be a permutation group in sage. The current iterator `for g in S` iterates by a brute force algorithm through the elements keeping the complete group in memory to check if an element was seen before.

The new algorithm reimplements the algorithm used in gap, and indeed takes the important ingredients from gap. gap computes a chain ` e = S1 in S2 in ... in Sk = S` of subgroups (obtained using the Schreier-Sims algorithm) for which the cosets of `Si` inside ` S{i+1} ` are particularly easy to compute.
This yields a sequence of cosets `[e]=C1, C2, ..., Ck` such that every element in `S` has a unique representation `g = g1*...*gk` for `gi in Ci`.

In sage, the new algorithm is to

* directly compute in gap the list `C1, C2, ..., Ck`
* translate the elements in all these lists to sage (this takes too long and should be improved)
* produce an iterator for all elements in `S` by iterating over all products of elements in these lists.

Let me know if you meant something else...

>  in your patch, both say for g in S: -- how do these iterations work? (I imagine S is a subgroup in the SGS chain)

No, `S = SGS.pop()` so `S = Ci` is the next layer of coset representatives. Let us go through the code with the notation as above:

```
        def elements(SGS):
            S = SGS.pop()
            if not SGS:
                for g in S:
                    yield g
            else:
                for s in elements(SGS):
                    for g in S:
                        yield s._mul_(g)
```

Given such a sequence `SGS = C1,C2,...,Ci`, `elements(SGS)` iterates over all elements in `Si`. This is done by recursively doing the computation for `C1,C2,..,C{i-1} ` and then yielding all elements in `S{i-1} ` multiplied with all elements in `S=Ci`.

`if not SGS` means that we have reached the trivial subgroup and `S = [()]`. So the first `for g in S: yield g` could be replaced with `yield S[0]`.

CPU times: user 4.51 s, sys: 396 ms, total: 4.9 s
Wall time: 5.08 s
sage: time x = A.strong_generating_system(implementation="gap")
CPU times: user 2.67 s, sys: 80.3 ms, total: 2.75 s
Wall time: 2.77 s
```

so the iterations are equally fast, but the translation from gap permutations to sage permutations takes 2.5 secs.

You can have a look at [CossidentePenttilaGraph()](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/854f9764d14236110b8d7f7b35a7d52017e044f8/src/sage/graphs/generators/classical_geometries.py#L1222) for the use of `libgap.function_factory` (so that you can basically call your own GAP function via libgap).

So you can change your code as follows:

```
gap_cosets = libgap.function_factory("""function ( S0 )
    local   CosetsStabChain;
    CosetsStabChain := function(S)  # for the recursive call
    local   cosets,             # element list, result
            new_coset,          #
            pnt,                # point in the orbit of <S>
            rep;                # inverse representative for that point

    # if <S> is trivial then it is easy
    if Length(S.generators) = 0  then
        cosets := [ [S.identity] ];

    # otherwise
    else

        # compute the elements of the stabilizer
        cosets := CosetsStabChain( S.stabilizer );

        # loop over all points in the orbit
        new_coset := [];
        for pnt  in S.orbit  do

            # add the corresponding coset to the set of elements
            rep := S.identity;
            while S.orbit[1] ^ rep <> pnt  do
                 rep := LeftQuotient( S.transversal[pnt/rep], rep );
            od;
            Add( new_coset, rep );
        od;
        Add( cosets, new_coset );
   fi;

   # return the result
   return cosets;
   end;
   return CosetsStabChain(S0);
end;""")
```

Now one can do

```
sage: G=libgap.AlternatingGroup(4)
sage: S=G.StabChain()
sage: gap_cosets(S)
[ [ () ], [ (), (2,4,3), (2,3,4) ], [ (), (1,4,3), (1,3,4), (1,2,4) ] ]
```


another useful thing is syntax like `G=libgap(PermutationGroup([(1,2)]))` to convert
from Sage's group (implemented with pexpect GAP, I gather) to libgap.

Thank you, Dima! I did these changes together with tons of small changes that had a huge impact on the running time.

Beside this, I arrived at the following, and wonder if this is okay doing: Given I have

* a `PermutationGroupElement` "sample" and
* a `list` "new_perm" representing a permutation in one-line notation in the *same permutation group* as "sample"

It seems that, oddly, we do not have a fast way of generating new permutations from these lists, despite the fact that we can multiply permutations very fast. I thus provide a new `PermutationGroupElement` method `_generate_new` that basically takes a copy from the given `PermutationGroupElement` and only overwrites its underlying c list. The code is basically copied from `_mul_`.

An example would be

```
sage: S = PermutationGroup(SymmetricGroup(4).gens())
sage: sample = S([2,3,4,1])
sage: lst1 = []
sage: lst2 = [2,1]
sage: lst3 = [4,3,2,1]
sage: pi1 = sample._generate_new(lst1); pi1
()
sage: pi2 = sample._generate_new(lst2); pi2
(1,2)
sage: pi3 = sample._generate_new(lst3); pi3
(1,4)(2,3)
```

> i.e. that mul call on permutations in __iter_alt__, is it actually in (lib)GAP?

No, this is pure cython and uses `PermutationGroupElement._mul_(left, _right)`, no (lib)GAP involved here.

Since both algorithms are the same, and the strong generating set in the Sage version is taken through libGAP, I suspect that the time advantage of Sage really comes from this superfast cython multiplication of permutation group elements.

> I thought that libgap has a fast method to convert GAP permutations to Sage

This is not the case: libgap uses `GapElement_Permutation.sage` which returns `PermutationGroupElement(libgap.ListPerm(self).sage())`, so it goes through the ordinary permutation group element constructor that is **very** slow because of tons of checks. This is why I wrote `_generate_new` that just uses the data from a given element and overwrites its c array containing the permutation:

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4)])
sage: one = P.one()
sage: l = [4,3,2,1]
sage: %timeit P(l)
1000 loops, best of 3: 579 µs per loop
sage: %timeit one._generate_new(l)
The slowest run took 39.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 203 ns per loop
```

Not really, because my method (A) makes use of the fact that one knows the permutation group the element lives in a priori, and (B) does not check the input whatsoever for correctness (and might result in segfaults if not used properly).

The first is an issue because `<libgap perm>` does not know which parent a gap permutation lives in (and neither does gap iirc), while the second might be neglected in case we expect that we always get something reasonable fromo gap.

OK, thanks - it's not immediately clear with all that methods using `_gap_` in that class.

Anyhow, I don't understand why libGAP creates `PermutationGroupElement` rather than 
a `Permutation`.
It would be natural to me to have this as the default,
mostly as it does not involve constructing a parent (GAP permutations don't really have parents in GAP, they are all in every `SymmetricGroup()` of degree at least `LargestMovedPoint()` of the permutation.
Then your hack can be used for fast libgap->Sage conversion of permutations.

I agree, this would get down the speed quite a bit

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)])
sage: l = [8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
sage: %timeit P(l, check=False)

100000 loops, best of 3: 6.74 µs per loop
```

but my hack would not work in this case because it uses the c structure underlying `PermutationGroupElement` which doesn't exist (caution: haven't rechecked!) for `Permutation`, and this hack is possibly still an order of magnitude faster

```
sage: one = P.one()
sage: %timeit one._generate_new(l)
The slowest run took 128.70 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

I am still waiting for someone to have a look at this...

In principle, I think this implementation is a strong improvement to permutation groups in Sage, and since I am not very good in optimizing in cython, there might a few simple improvements left to be found. I don't think it is ready for a positive review, but it certainly is for a review of the technical details.

compiling, or also running sage? I got the import error as in comment:80 only when running sage.

> Does one really need to make it cpdef? Perhaps start with cdef, make a cpdef wrapper then?

I could try this, but it seems so simple: I have a cpdef function on class A that takes an element of class B as second argument, and I want to move this to a cpdef function on class B that takes an element of class A as second argument...

I have no idea what that means! (Or rather how to fix this.)

you see there libgap.so.4, so it can find the symbols there...

Surely it's some declaration missing somewhere, and that's all.
Or, perhaps, the corresponding GAP function should somehow be blessed in libgap extension.

This thus became a method for `PermutationGroupElement` with argument `GapElement_List`. In particular, I have this method now for python lists and for gap list.

As a byproduct, one may call this from the `one` of the parent if only the parent is given but not the element.

See that this later is indeed slower:

```
sage: P = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)])
sage: one = P.one()
sage: perm = libgap.eval('[]')
sage: %timeit one._generate_new_GAP(perm)
The slowest run took 138.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 174 ns per loop
sage: %timeit P.one()._generate_new_GAP(perm)
The slowest run took 77.00 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 220 ns per loop
```

I get the latter is faster:

```
sage: A = PermutationGroup([(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)])
sage: %timeit libgap.Group(A.gens())
The slowest run took 13.32 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 53.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit libgap(A)
The slowest run took 4.21 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 35.6 µs per loop

Commented out code gets removed quite quickly by other people and looks bad to put slower code. The data is in the history if someone wants to look it up.

If a particular version of GAP is consistent, than no comment is necessary (a number of doctests typically change when GAP upgrades). We have never guaranteed an output order for group iteration, so I don't see any point in mentioning it.

That is libGAP code on that line (comes from the `libgap.function_factory("""`), so it is not Python3 incompatible.

I think I forgot to run the `--long` when I checked this locally (and so I concluded that it was a spurious patchbot fault). However, I did confirm this locally. It seems like the group is too large to pass to libgap:

```
sage: libgap(aut)  # the group from the test in question
python2: libgap.c:184: libgap_get_input: Assertion `strlen(libGAP_stdin_buffer) < length' failed.
```

It has 1152 generators! However `gap` handles this fine.

So I just reverted the first change on comment:115, and that seems to fix the problem. I can see how that is more safe as I am surprised `libgap` is passing things by strings. Which might account for the fact that `@`stumpc5 and me got different timing results.

Right, but the computation uses all of the elements as generators, which is what makes it blowout the buffer.

The digits after `2.18169499` are not right, for the exact evaluation gives
`2.18169499062...`.

```
sage: (5/12*sqrt(5) + 5/4).n()
2.18169499062491
```

That's why I'd prefer truncation as I suggested.
