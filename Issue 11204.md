Currently to build sage (the spkg) four files are involved in major way:
1. SConstuct to build sage-clib
2. setup.py
3. module_list.py
4. sage/misc/cython.py

The last three to build the sage python extensions. setup.py, and SConstruct both have the version of python used hardcoded in them, module_list.py doesn't refer to the python version anywhere. cython.py mention the python version explicitly in doctest but smartly find the version used for building all by itself. 

In this ticket I bring this smartness to SConstruct and setup.py. The advantage of doing this is that sage then can be build with either python-2.6 or 2.7 (and 3.x in the future) without patching. Of course it may still require patches to fix doctest and syntax in some parts - but you would be able to build sage in the first place without having to patch the build system. It has been found to be an impediment to testing in #9958.

No apologies required. It isn't officially out but Jeroen  has "prototypes" alpha0, alpha1 and alpha2 already on [http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/release/).
It is a bit a pain to know that if you do something against 4.7.rc4 it will have to be put back to "needs work" once 4.7 is finally out and Jeroen officially announce the next alpha.

The python documentation for sys.version says "Do not extract version information out of it, rather, use version_info and the functions provided by the platform module."  It looks to me as though you could use

```
platform.python_version()  # gives '2.6.4'
platform.python_version().rstrip('.', 1)[0]  # gives '2.6'
ver = platform.python_version_tuple()  # gives ('2', '6', '4')
ver[0] + '.' + ver[1]  # gives '2.6'
```

or

```
ver = sys.version_info
str(ver[0]) + '.' + str(ver[1])   # gives '2.6'
```

I'll take a look at the rest of the patches...

Can there ever be version numbers like '2.10'?  Choosing the first three characters of the version string seems riskier than removing everything starting from the second dot.

2.10 in particular no. But your general point is valid. I will address this. Thanks for pointing this out.

Hi Mariah,

I fixed this test as part of #9958 in [http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9958/trac_9958-fix-misc_cythonpy.patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/attachment/ticket/9958/trac_9958-fix-misc_cythonpy.patch) I thought it was appearing because of python-2.7.

If it shows up for you with python-2.6 it is strange that it didn't before the patch.

In any case if it shows up for you the above patch will have to be split and moved to this ticket. Just a few minutes.
