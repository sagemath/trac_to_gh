Keywords: finite words, lexicographic order

It seems that Sage has a problem to compare words defined over the alphabet 1, 2, 3, ..., in particular when a word is prefix of the other : 

```
sage: W = FiniteWords([1,2,3])
sage: u = W([2,1,2])
sage: p = u[:2]
sage: s = u[2:]
sage: p
word: 21
sage: s
word: 2
sage: p < s
False
sage: s < p
False
sage: p > s
False
sage: s > p
False
```


It seems to work normally if the two words I compare are not prefix of the other.

Moreover, the problem does not appear when dealing with words over another alphabet :

```
sage: W = FiniteWords('abc')
sage: u = W('bab')
sage: p = u[:2]
sage: s = u[2:]
sage: p < s
False
sage: s < p
True
sage: p > s
True
sage: s > p
False
```
