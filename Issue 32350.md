From #31621: can we also make the following changes?

- change gsl's `spkg-install.in` as follows:

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/gsl/spkg-install.in b/build/pkgs/gsl/spkg-install.in
index 179b78963a..ef156a7a5c 100644

+sdh_configure LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS `pkg-config --libs-only-L cblas`"
 sdh_make
 sdh_make_install
```

 As it stands, on OSX + homebrew, `./configure --with-system-gsl=no` fails when building `gsl` with the error

```
configure: error: in `/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-9.5.beta1/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gsl-2.6/src':
configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
```

 and the `config.log` file says `ld: library not found for -lopenblas`.

- Also, I think `pkgconf` should be an order-only dependency for gsl:

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/gsl/dependencies b/build/pkgs/gsl/dependencies
index 052eb4373d..576809127c 100644

 since the package installation scripts use `pkg-config`.
