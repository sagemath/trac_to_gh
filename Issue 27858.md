CC:  @dimpase @embray @saraedum @jhpalmieri

This ticket adds options such as `--enable-lrslib`, `--enable-topcom` for all optional and experimental packages to `configure`. 

Subsequent `make` will then install these packages.

This will simplify installations of sage with a list of optional packages. 

(This was previously discussed in #21538, which did not clearly enough distinguish this proposal from the topic of using system packages, #27567.)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28095

That's caused by another misclassification, for historical reasons, of package types (like the one for `gfortran` fixed in #29053).

```
$ cat build/pkgs/gmp/type 
optional
$ cat build/pkgs/mpir/type 
optional

These should actually be `standard` - they are mutually exclusive standard packages.
