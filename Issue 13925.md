# Issue 13925: Incorrect notebook typesetting due to '\texttt'

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: lftabera

Original creation time: 2013-02-15 09:31:23

Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

CC:  jhpalmieri

Keywords: mathjax, texttt

Vector space morphisms do not typeset correctly in the notebook with Mathjax because it does not compile \texttt.

Fortunately, the bug is already resolved by a patch that was not merged in #13143

You are right. Do you mind to re-update the patch to this ticket? 
That will help the release manager and I am reviewing it anyway.

The problem is corrected, the output looks ok with show command or notebook typesetting.
