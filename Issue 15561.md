OK, but please do not revert #10108 since there was a real problem fixed there.  This is just a question of putting the right expected output into a doctest to allow for whitespace differences.  The output really does contain a tab character after the colon.

I hope someone knows how to fix this, other than removing tab chars from all eclib output (I count 321 lines in eclib's source code) which would be very tedious.

The terminal decides to replace the tab character with spaces, not eclib. Just change the doctest to an ellipsis instead of testing for the presence of a tab character.

I thought that everything after the ellipsis was ignored?  Ignoring everything after the first tab would mean that the correctness of the output was not tested.
