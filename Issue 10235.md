Assignee: cremona

CC:  cremona was

Keywords: modular symbols

The following two computations should yield the same answer. First with the modular symbols in sage


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')
sage: m = E.modular_symbol()
sage: m(1/7)
7/10 
sage: m(0)
1/5
```


and then using ec_lib :


```
sage: m = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=True)
sage: m(1/7)
6/5
sage: m(0)
1/5
```


That the actual value of [1/7] must be 7/10 is illustrated be the following


```
sage: ans = E.anlist(10^5)
sage: twopii = CC(2*pi*i)
sage: s = 0
sage: n = 1
sage: while n < 50000:
....:     s += ans[n]/n*exp(twopii*n/7)
....:     n += 1
sage: s.real()/E.period_lattice().basis()[0]
0.694799317284868
```


The fact that both values at 0 are equal show that it is unlikely that this is a problem with the scaling of the modular symbols.

----

Here is another bug. Maybe the same, maybe different. This one looks like being in scaling. But I am puzzled, because this example was used originally in the design of the scaling function.


```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('121b1')
sage: m = E.modular_symbol()
sage: m(1/7)
2
sage: m._scaling
-2
```


It should in fact be [1/7]+ = 1/2.


```
sage: ans = E.anlist(10^5)
sage: s = 0
sage: n = 1
sage: while n < 100000:
    s += ans[n]/n*exp(twopii*n/7)
    n += 1
....:     
sage: s.real()/E.period_lattice().basis()[0]
0.484665473298495
```


This was originally reported by Andrew Ohana.

One guess might be that I misinterpreted what the output of eclib is. I assumed that in line 553 in ell_modular_symbol.py that the output of 


```
sage: from sage.libs.cremona.newforms import ECModularSymbol
sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a1')

This second patch, applied after the first one, will solve the both issues in the ticket description and revert back some errors introduced earlier.

The problem was a "/2" in a formula. I have absolutely no idea why I put that there. To check that the formula is now correct, I did the following::


```
sage: rs = flatten([[a/m for a in srange(1,m) if gcd(a,m)==1] for m in srange(2,20)])
sage: for E in cremona_curves([11..100]):
....:     m = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=False)
....:     me = E.modular_symbol(use_eclib=True)
....:     for r in rs:
....:         if m(r) != me(r):
....:             print E.label(), r, m(r), me(r)
```


which gladly did not yield any output.

So these patches are ready for review.
