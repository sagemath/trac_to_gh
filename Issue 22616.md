Definitely something that should be done. However, perhaps we should change the width to `300 px` as this is the most common size for plots (there is 1 that is `400 px` and some that are `200 px`)?

I specifically chose 500 because the 300px images were difficult to see. I tried 400 as well before settling on 500.

An idea, which I couldn't find, I wanted to see if there's a way to limit the height by cropping instead of stretching. It looks like sphinx_plot always returns a square image, so when adding

`:height: 200 px`

or something we get a shrunk image which still has pointless whitespace. I couldn't find anything in the documentation about cropping, but if you do know of a way to crop, it'd be nice as some of the images definitely take up a lot of vertical room and would be nice to shrink them.

Alternatively, I can reduce the size to 300px as is more standard with the knowledge that some images may be difficult to see. (Note the main difficulty in seeing the images was the words/symbols on the images, so I can potentially reduce the size as well if we don't care about being able to read labels on the images)

What is the dpi (or resolution) on your laptop? It might be hard to read because that is very high. 

Unfortunately I don't know enough about the `.. PLOT::` to answer your questions. I do know we do not want the Sage doc size to grow too much, so I feel that we should make them `300 px`. However, the html has its own spacing rules, so the whitespace may come from that too.

Just two comments for now:
- Aram presented the updated documentation, and it made me jump up and down. So much better.
- I can't wait until sphinx would actually use vector graphics rather than bitmaps. This would resolve all those resolution tweaking issues.

My dpi is fairly high, so I've gone ahead and reduced all the graphs to 300px. Can you look them over and see if they actually look good in the smaller size?

`@`nthiery - sphinx seems to be lacking quite a lot when it comes to images. Hopefully they'll get to updating it in the near future so we can make plot look even more awesome.

```

I downloaded and tested on my machine as well. After doing both a distclean and a doc-clean and then makeing sage again I was not able to reproduce the error. 

Additionally, I looked at the error given by Volker, in particular:

    
` [dochtml] OSError: [combinat ] /home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/root_system/plot.py:docstring of sage.combinat.root_system.plot.PlotOptions.color:10: WARNING: Exception occurred in plotting plot-15 `


This line suggests to me that the problem exists in the class PlotOptions in the method color. This method was NOT altered. In fact, running a git blame shows that the code here has not changed since 2016 (and most of it not being changed since 2013)

* `_mul_` is not legal since there is an argument missing past the last subscript.

I'd appreciate it if you don't send me half-assed tickets on the vague hope that they work, I do have a lot of tickets to juggle and can't spend that much time on individual issues.

}
```

The problem is this test/plot:

```
    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=85/100) # long time
    Graphics3d Object

.. PLOT::
    :width: 300 px

    L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sphinx_plot(L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=85/100))
```

I also now know why it fails and can reproduce it in a Sage session:

```
sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
sage: p = L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=int(85)/int(100))
sage: p.tachyon()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value
```

There is no Sage preprocessor run, so the bounding box gets evaluated to 0, which in turn, creates an empty `Graphics3dGroup`, which causes the `reduce` to fail:

```
sage: g = p.all[9]   # I think this will be the same for all, but not sure
sage: g.all
[]
```

This is now #23200. This is not a dependency as the correct picture should be plotted, which means the bounding box should be a rational number, meaning we never get the empty `Graphics3dGroup` (and generates the correct picture). I verified this last commit fixes the problem on the buildbot where it didn't work before.

That does not quite explain why we could not reproduce this failure locally, but it does explain everything else. I'm not going to bother with this last detail.
