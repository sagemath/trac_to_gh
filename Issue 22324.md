# Issue 22324: iterating over a Pari t_POL creates an infinite loop.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22561

Original creator: culler

Original creation time: 2017-03-09 23:15:12

CC:  defeo vdelecroix

Keywords: cypari2

The following reasonable and apparently innocuous code sends Sage into an infinite loop:

sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
sage: list(p)

The reason is that the gen object has no `__iter__` method, but it has a `__getitem__` method which accepts any integer index and returns 0 for indices larger than the degree of the polynomial.  Since there is no `__iter__` method, python builds an iterator using `__getitem__`.

There is a simple fix: `__getitem__` should raise an `IndexError` when the index is larger than the degree.  I also think it should raise an `IndexError` when the index is negative.

I think it would be better to implement `__iter__` instead.

Comment by vdelecroix created at 2017-03-10 10:59:07

What about `__len__`?


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-03-10 11:11:09

`__len__` already exists.


---

There are various doctest failures in `src/sage/rings` involving Galois permutations. I don't have time to look at those right now, so if somebody else wants to continue, please do.

Implementing `__iter__` was definitely the right thing to do, and this implementation works great for me, testing in `CyPari`.  Thanks!

Although it is wonderful to have `__iter__`, I still think that `__getitem__` should raise an `IndexError` if one tries to access a t_POL coefficient with negative index, or index larger than the degree. This just makes sense, and also is consistent with how it works for power series.

I ran into a minor compatibility issue (i.e. a Cython bug) with Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04: `Cython 0.25.2` had trouble parsing the f"..." formatted strings passed to warn or `TypeError`.  The error looks like this:

```
            from warnings import warn
            warn(f"iterating a PARI {self.type()} is deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
                 ^
------------------------------------------------------------

cypari_src/gen.pyx:320:18: Expected ')', found 'BEGIN_STRING'
```

This did not happen on macOS using Python 3.6.

For the power series `1 + O(x^5)`, the `__getitem__` should only raise `IndexError` for indices greater or equal than `5`. It is not related to the actual degree of the underlying polynomial but the precision. One can think of a polynomial as `p + O(x^infinity)` and hence no `IndexError` looks the most appropriate to me.

Sorry to ask, but can you please double-check that this was indeed using Cython 0.25.2 and not some earlier version? Support for `f`-strings was added only recently to Cython.

You are right, Jeroen.  Sorry!  My build system had cython 0.25.2 installed.  But Python 3 uses cython3, not cython, and cython3 was an older version.

Vincent, I am having trouble following your logic.  Why should it be correct to ask for the coefficient of `x^-3` in a polynomial?  I agree that if a polynomial were a special case of a power series (with infinite precision) then it might make sense to pretend that there were coefficients of all positive degrees.  You might similarly argue that a polynomial is a special case of a Laurent polynomial, or Laurent series.  But we are talking about how to model these concepts as Python objects.  We expect Python subclasses to override methods of their parent class in a way which reflects how the structure of the subclass differs from that of the parent. So we should expect polynomials to override `__getitem__` and `__len__` in a way which reflects the differences between a polynomial and a power series or Laurent polynomial or Laurent series.

Can you give an example of a Python container which allows `X[n]` for `n > len(X)`??

A polynomial is not a container.

Comment by culler created at 2017-03-14 14:40:21

IMHO, when you say len(p) or p[5] you are treating p as if it were a container for its coefficients.

The dictionary `{2: 'hello'}` :-P. More seriously, polynomials in GP behave that way

```
? p = x^3 + 2
%1 = x^3 + 2
? length(p)
%2 = 4
? polcoeff(p, 5) 
%3 = 0
? polcoeff(p, -3)
%4 = 0
```

On a related note, see that integers have numerators and denominators!

```
sage: 12.numerator()
12
sage: 12.denominator()
1
```

In a CAS, you certainly want some combatibility between embeddings of structures (like `ZZ c QQ` or `R[x] c R((X))`).

True, GP does handle polynomial coefficients that way.  But the job of modeling GP belongs to the pari object, and its behavior would not be changed.


```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
sage: p.polcoeff(25)
0

>>> from cypari import *
>>> p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
>>> p.polcoeff(25)
0
```



---

Comment by culler created at 2017-03-14 15:13:22

I guess the bottom line here is that Sage's polynomial ring handles polynomial coefficients that way:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: p = R(x^2 - 3*x + 2)
sage: p[25]
0
sage: p[-2]
0
```


To me, that is a convincing argument for why pari polynomials should behave the same way. Components of Sage should certainly be consistent with Sage itself. So I will stop clogging up trac with discussions of this. :^)
