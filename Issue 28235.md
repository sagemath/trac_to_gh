I get one failure on debian+py3, but I don't know why it would be related to this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 206.7 src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py", line 72, in sage_setup.optional_extension.OptionalExtension
Failed example:
    print(ext.__class__.__name__)
Expected:
    Extension
Got:
    CythonizeExtension
**********************************************************************
```

Otherwise, it fixes the problem at #28454, and it works on OS X.

The doctest failure in comment:3 is a red herring. I get it with or without this branch, and my debian virtual machine is pretty flaky anyway. I think we should move forward with this. It may be too late to get it merged into Sage 8.9, but we can try. At least it will be part of an early beta for 9.0.
