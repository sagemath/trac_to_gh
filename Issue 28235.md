Changes in this release of eclib relevant to Sage are consistent flushing of all run-time warnings and messages, and avoidance of ever calling abort() in library functions.

Source code to go in upstream/ is at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20190909.tar.bz2

I get one failure on debian+py3, but I don't know why it would be related to this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 206.7 src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py", line 72, in sage_setup.optional_extension.OptionalExtension
Failed example:
    print(ext.__class__.__name__)
Expected:
    Extension
Got:
    CythonizeExtension
**********************************************************************
```

Otherwise, it fixes the problem at #28454, and it works on OS X.

Great news that this fixes #28454!  Thanks for testing.  If we can get this into the next release then my patch at #28454 would not be needed.

The doctest failure in comment:3 is a red herring. I get it with or without this branch, and my debian virtual machine is pretty flaky anyway. I think we should move forward with this. It may be too late to get it merged into Sage 8.9, but we can try. At least it will be part of an early beta for 9.0.

Thanks JHP for the quick action and help with this issue.  Now all I need is someone to +1 #28372 and I can have a rest.
