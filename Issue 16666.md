The following (requires optional database_cremona_ellcurve) reveals a problem:

```
sage: CremonaDatabase().largest_conductor()
349999
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,1,0,-141083,-20443787])
sage: E.conductor()
246400
sage: E.label()
...
RuntimeError: Cremona label not known for Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x^2 - 141083*x - 20443787 over Rational Field.
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,-1,0,-16,421])
sage: E.conductor()
252840
sage: E.label()
RuntimeError: Cremona label not known for Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - x^2 - 16*x + 421 over Rational Field.
```

which was reported by Benjamin Matschke and Rafael von Kanel on 2014-08-28.  The database files are missing all curves with conductors in the ranges 246400-246499 and 252800-252899, in total 1455 elliptic curves in 962 isogeny classes.

In preparing the new database file (the file cremona.db in SAGE_ROOT/local/share/cremona) which is done using the command sage.databases.cremona.build() on the updated tar file I find that I have to change that script, because I have "tidied up" the file structure in the tarball so that the data files are in subdirectories.

It seems sensible to make those changes in the same branch as the ones for the new spkg (updating package version and checksums).

If the new spkg works OK I think that will be good evidence for the new cremona.db file being good.
