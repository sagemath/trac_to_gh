Keywords: zeta function, scheme, finite field

Currently there is a generic method zeta_series for schemes over a finite field, but not zeta_function. It would be useful to have the latter so that zeta_series could invoke it when it is implemented (which hopefully will happen for hyperelliptic curves soon).

It's not clear to me what the goal here is. The initial code seems to be using the zeta_function call to try and compute the zeta series as opposed to trying to compute zeta functions for generic schemes. So, are we improving zeta series or trying to make a generic .zeta_function()?? The later seems daunting...

I've improved the zeta_series code to allow for non-prime base fields.

Sorry, am on vacation this week and hence unable to participate in sd87, but I can still clarify what I had in mind here!

What I had in mind is that the generic .zeta_function() returns a NotImplementedError. Then the generic .zeta_series() method would check for the existence of a .zeta_function() method, and if present would call it and convert the rational function into a power series instead of falling back to manually counting points.

That is an important improvement, but it is actually separate from the issue I had in mind. Maybe we should create a new ticket and put this patch there instead?

ok, that is certainly reasonable to do. I've added the generic function and put my doc test is the right place.

My zeta_series improvement is such a minor change and related to the original functionality, I'm fine with leaving it as part of this ticket. Perhaps we should make a slight change to the ticket description to include improving zeta_series in the generic case?
