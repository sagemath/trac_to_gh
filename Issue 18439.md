Part of an effort to implement Jean-Baptiste Priez's external Combinatorial Hopf Algebra package into the Sage source code, began by the author in ticket # 13793, and now being broken up into smaller component tickets.

This ticket will add categories for dendriform algebras, dendriform coalgebras, and bidendriform bialgebras.
