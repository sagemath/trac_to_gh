About the bug that you mentioned, it is really a bug?

I am asking because "polar" means different things depending on which corner of the street you stand at...


```
sage: p = LatticePolytope([[1,0],[0,1],[-1,-1]])
sage: p
2-d reflexive polytope #0 in 2-d lattice M
sage: p.polar()
2-d reflexive polytope #15 in 2-d lattice N
sage: p.polar().vertices()
N( 2, -1),
N(-1,  2),
N(-1, -1)
in 2-d lattice N
```

In the tutorial, it would be good to still have an example where it really still gives an error. There is likely such an example in the library (see those that are forced to be exact).

I would then keep a error and a warning in the tutorial to maintain an up-to-date document.

Thanks for checking this. No it's not a bug. It's exactly the output described in `OUTPUT`.

It's still confusing. But this ticket shouldn't be about making things more uniform.
