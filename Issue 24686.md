The patch is working well, and I tried also with multiple edges

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 0), (0,0)], loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.sparse6_string()
':@N'
sage: H = Graph(_)
sage: H
Looped multi-graph on 1 vertex
sage: H.size()
2
```


Can you add a doctest in the sparse6 encode / decoding methods, like:

```
Graphs with 1 vertex are correctly handled (:trac:`24923`)::

    sage: Graph([(0, 0)], loops=True).sparse6_string()
    ':@^'
    sage: G = Graph(_)
    sage: G.order(), G.size()
    (1, 1)
    sage: Graph([(0, 0), (0, 0)], loops=True, multiedges=True).sparse6_string()
    ':@^'
    sage: H = Graph(_)
    sage: H.order(), H.size()
    (1, 2)
```
