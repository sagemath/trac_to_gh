Hello,

looks good. I have made a reviewer's commit.

if you agree with my small changes, you can set to positive review.

Good enought, done so.

Frédéric, you forgot your reviewer name.

Also, two very minor, nit-picky things. Capitalize Eulerian here:

```
:meth:`~FinitePoset.is_eulerian` | Return ``True`` if the poset is eulerian.
```

and a period here:

```
See :wikipedia:`Eulerian_poset`
```

Done this. I also changed `if x%2:` to `if x%2==1:`.

I also opened #19753 and start it with this Eulerian vs. eulerian -thing. How should "hypohamiltonian" and "semi-eulerian" be written?
