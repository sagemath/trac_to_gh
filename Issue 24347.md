This patch will add the power poset as an example poset.

(Got the idea when thinking about mail from Victor Porton and doing some search.)

Is this always a meet-semilattice? Don't have working brains now to think about it.

IDK about comment:2, but the ticket LGTM. So if you want to figure out if it is a meet-semilattice beforehand, then you can leave this as needs review, otherwise, you can set it to positive review.

Too lazy to think more just now.

Thanks.
