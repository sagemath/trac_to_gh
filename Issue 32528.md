LGTM. I tested your ticket and ran 

`./sage -t src/sage/modular` 

without any failed doctest. Do you prefer to wait until the pathbots results before I put this in positive review?

This is a good point. Funny thing, the full modular group and the special linear group SL(2, ZZ) are not considered the same object in [SageMath](SageMath):


```
sage: SL(2, ZZ)
Special Linear Group of degree 2 over Integer Ring
sage: SL2Z
Modular Group SL(2,Z)
sage: SL2Z == SL(2, ZZ)
False
```


Moreover:


```
sage: ModularForms(SL(2, ZZ), 12)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: group of unknown type.
```


I believe that, from a user point of view, this could be confusing.

By the way, `â„¤` even works as an identifier in Python and Sage (but it seems to get canonicalized into `Z`).

We have already plenty of unicode in the repr of many objects. This move is just one further step in this direction.

I have negative feelings about this though not strong ones. Reading the trac message and this ticket on an old android tablet I cannot even see the character which is being proposed as a replacement.  Is the plan to do the same for Q and Qbar and R or C?

I really find it surprising that anyone cares enough about such things!

Possible solution (cf. my other comment above):

- Keep `_repr_` more or less as is, encouraging output that can be copied back into a Sage shell.
- Add an optional `_str_` method which returns a human-readable (possibly Unicode) string.
- Add a global switch to let users choose between the two display modes.

Overall though, I agree that this is not a very important issue.

Hello,

I think that everybody here has made some good points. I had some thought in favor about this ticket and I wanted to share them. 

First, I don't think that the changes in this ticket would negatively affect that much the general [SageMath](SageMath) user. Indeed, in all my years of using [SageMath](SageMath) for my studies or research, I have never copied/pasted the representation of an object to the console. Take for example:

```
sage: ModularForms(1, 12)
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Modular Group SL(2,Z) of weight 12 over Rational Field
```

The representation of the modular forms spaces does not display (almost) anything that could be copied back into the console (except maybe "SL(2, Z)").

Next, if a user is confused about the syntax because the output is "â„¤" and not "ZZ", then I think that the fault goes back to the Sage tutorial/reference manuals for doing a poor job of educating the user (but I strongly don't think that's the case). Again, in all the years I used Sage (mostly for modular forms), I always knew that `ZZ` stands for the ring of integers.

Finally, these days many machines are able to display unicode characters, except maybe an old tablet or my smartwatch, but it is very unlikely that a user would install the software on these machines.

I've just tried out pasting "â„¤" into a terminal window and indeed it displays properly in a modern terminal and, curiously, even in xterm (although it looks awful, but so do most characters there).

However, it actually looks a lot like a "Z", but it isn't. I really have to stare at my screen for a bit to see the difference, and if I wouldn't know to look for the difference, I could easily miss it. The python interpreter rounds it to a Z in identifiers, but not in strings. So:

```
>>> dict(â„¤ = 1)
{'Z': 1}
>>> {'â„¤' : 1}
{'â„¤': 1}
```

yield dictionaries with different keys. Mathematical formulas produced by computer algebra systems usually look awful, and a few unicode characters don't really improve that. Having the capability of producing a LaTeX representation helps, but generally needs editing for inclusion in manuscripts anyway. I don't think it's worth the extra burden of confusion.
