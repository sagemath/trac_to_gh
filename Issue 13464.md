The following bug was reported to me by Timo Jolivet last July 2012. It is still there is sage-5.3:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism({1:[1,2],2:[2,3],3:[4],4:[5],5:[6],6:[7],7:[8],8:[9],9:[10],10:[1]})
sage: (s^7).fixed_points()
[word: 122..., word: 2,3,4,...]
sage: (s^7).reversal().fixed_points()
MemoryError [...]
```

Also reported by Timo Jolivet in October 2012 the following hangs forever:


```
sage: s = WordMorphism("1->321331332133133,2->133321331332133133,3->2133133133321331332133133")

It might be related to the bug in the description of this ticket... I will wait until a solution is found for the first before creating a new ticket for the second as the solution might fix both.

In fact, this bugs comes from the `_fixed_point_iterator` method which expand a possibly long word as a list :

Indeed, the solution (which make use of iterators instead of lists) fixes both problems. I just attached a patch. Needs review!

Moreover, I am getting some timing improvements due to the change of the code of `fixed_points` method which do not depend anymore on the `periodic_points` method :

BEFORE:


```
   sage: f = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->cab,c->bcc')     
   sage: %timeit f.fixed_points()           
   125 loops, best of 3: 2.1 ms per loop        
```


AFTER:


```
   sage: f = WordMorphism('a->ab,b->cab,c->bcc')
   sage: %timeit f.fixed_points()               
   625 loops, best of 3: 340 Âµs per loop   
```
