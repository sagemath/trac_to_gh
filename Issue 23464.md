This is needed for the gc update on #23700, 
see [GC website](http://www.hboehm.info/gc/) for details.

The package is C headers and two small static libraries.

The tarball is here: http://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_source/libatomic_ops-7.4.4.tar.gz

Now `$CONFIGURE_FLAGS` is undefined and not used so you could remove that too.

Also, I have another change I need to propose but I'm still investigating a bit...
