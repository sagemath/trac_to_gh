On the wiki page about padic factoring it says that the implementation doesn't work correctly for some examples. Is there only a problem with some specific cases? I just tried a few products of low degree polynomials and the factorizations seemed ok.

I want to try to debug the code, so if you know of any simple examples for which it doesn't work, that would be helpful.

Other than the poor state of documentation and polish, I cannot find any faults.

Patch applies correctly on 7.5 and all doctests written so far pass. However:

In the doctest from `pfactortree()`:

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.padics.factor.factoring import jorder4,pfactortree 
sage: f = ZpFM(2,24,'terse')['x']( (x^32+16)*(x^32+16+2^16*x^2)+2^34 ) 
sage: pfactortree(f) # long (3.8s) 
[(1 + O(2^24))*x^64 + (65536 + O(2^24))*x^34 + (32 + O(2^24))*x^32 + (1048576 + O(2^24))*x^2 + (256 + O(2^24))] 
```

This is just returning the polynomial unfactored, so demonstrably the factoring isn't working here. We should get:

```
sage: f = ZpFM(2,24,'terse')['x']( (x^32+16)*(x^32+16+2^16*x^2)+2^34 )
sage: f.factor()
((1 + O(2^24))*x^32 + (65536 + O(2^24))*x^2 + (16 + O(2^24))) * ((1 + O(2^24))*x^32 + (16 + O(2^24)))
```

Also, we should rework this code so that a sage Factorization object is returned, and that pfactortree is called by the `.factor()` method attached to p-adic polynomials.

Note that increasing the precision yields a factorization:

```


In the case Simon pointed out, adding `2^34` doesn't do anything since the precision cap of the base ring is 24, so we have an actual example of a reducible polynomial being claimed to be irreducible.

This new patch replaces the first and has a great deal of improvements, bug-fixes, and documentation.  The examples should be more sensible now.

It should successfully factor monic, square-free, fixed-mod padic polynomials without fail.

I am running more tests to ensure its validity as well as implementing the transformations needed to handle non-monic cases, which would leave it only dependant on square-free decomposition.

I would hope that this code works for all kinds of p-adic polynomials (over `Zp`, over `Qp`, over field extensions, all with different kinds of precision).

It would be good if this code would also support the `factor_padic()` method for polynomials over `ZZ` and `QQ`.\n4. What happens if the assumption the the polynomial is squarefree doesn't hold?\n5. Units in the `Factorization` should be put in the \"unit\" part, this is wrong:\n\n```\nsage: x = polygen(ZpFM(2,10))\nsage: pfactor(3*x)[1]\n(1 + 2 + O(2^10), 1)\n```\n\n1.

Some comments (not planning to actually review this):
1. I would hope that this code works for all kinds of p-adic polynomials (over `Zp`, over `Qp`, over field extensions, all with different kinds of precision). Still, (almost) all examples in the doctests use `ZpFM`.
2. The `factor()` method doesn't actually use this code. What's the point then?
3. It would be good if this code would also support the `factor_padic()` method for polynomials over `ZZ` and `QQ`.
4. What happens if the assumption the the polynomial is squarefree doesn't hold?
5. Units in the `Factorization` should be put in the "unit" part, this is wrong:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZpFM(2,10))
sage: pfactor(3*x)[1]
(1 + 2 + O(2^10), 1)
```

1. Similarly, the primes should actually be primes, this should have a factor 2 with multiplicity 2:

```
sage: x = polygen(ZpFM(2,10))
sage: pfactor(4*x)[1]
(2^2 + O(2^10), 1)
```

It hasn't been optimized, so I'm hoping that these timings will improve (currently, a lot of time is spent in initialization of various objects that can be reduced).
