Partly because this is a nice release number, but mostly because its needed in #26254. I have no idea how to update packages so help is appreciated

The procedure to upgrade packages is explained in https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#upstream-urls:
`sage --package update-latest cython --commit`

I can confirm that 0.29.30 is the minimum cython version that will work for python 3.11.

I started some workflows to see whether this causes any problems.
