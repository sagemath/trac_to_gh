CC:  @jhpalmieri @jdemeyer @anneschilling @tscrim @videlec combinat @nthiery

As reported in #17898, `IntegerVector` ignores some of its arguments

```
sage: list(IntegerVectors(4, length=3, min_part=1)) # a bug?
[[4], [3, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 3], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This branch makes it raise exceptions where it should

I actually done a good chunk of work in this direction. However I very
soon realized that, to avoid changing a lot of doctests temporarilly
and reverting them back later on, we really want to have a class for
integer vectors of a given length (with constraints). A disjoint union is not enough. Indeed quite some of the doctests are about things like checking containment which is not available with a disjoint union.

The natural thing to implement this class is to base it on
`IntegerLists` (not `IntegerListsLex`). Since the code base for the
later is in a state of flux, I'd rather wait a couple days and base
the work on #18109. I also want to focus on other things with people
during the Sage days here. I guess it would be doable within the next
two week.

Or we can go for a temporary solution, but it feels like just
additional work for not much value: casual users won't benefit from
work here before 6.7 anyway, we are not in total rush.

Nicolas,

You told me that you would rebase this ticket on top of #17979 once that it will be merged. Could you honor this promise?

We work differently on many things. I need to be able to trust people I work with. You also know that I never believed in 'ticket that will be written later', or 'code in a state of flux'. This branch was in `needs_review` 5 weeks ago, and has not been reviewed because we were waiting on your ticket #17979.

Please do not let my work go to waste after we waited for you.

What ? To take over your work? `O_o`

I created this ticket when #17898 (which removed the stopgap) was reviewed (see comment:63:ticket:17898).

> I was going to fullfill way more than my promise.


17 months ago you were also going to fix cartesian products (#15425). See also #18182 which was created yesterday. And there are many many things that you were going to fix 3 or 5 years ago.

> Now you wasted my time, since I will need to rebase my work.


I don't know what work you are talking about. But since I created this ticket 5 weeks ago, I guess that you should base your work on top of this ticket instead of asking me to rebase mine.

Indeed, I had taken a lead advance on my promise, by merging in a good part of your work at the occasion where it was most productive for to do it.

By "my work" here, I meant "rebasing your branch on top of #17979".

> 17 months ago you were also going to fix cartesian products (#15425).


This is a long run task. More than half of the items are already
achieved.

> See also #18182 which was created yesterday.


#18182 is not a fix. It's a new feature. Beside I am actively helping
out Daniel who is working on it here at Sage Days 67.

When contributing infrastructure one certainly is responsible for
making sure that the infrastructure is robust, and that the basic
applications are available. But there is no reason why one should
implement each and every application of the infrastructure.

>  And there are many many things that you were going to fix 3 or 5 years ago.


And I did many of them, and in particular I believe I did all for
which I had set a specific timeline. And in the mean time I did a lot
of infrastructure, refactoring, and finalization work, prioritized
according to the needs of many people.

Now, and again, you are not my boss to judge on how I prioritize on
the many tasks that needs to be done.

> I don't know what work you are talking about.


3 hours of hard work on a proper cleanup of integer vectors (currently
stashed out), that I now need to rebase when it would have been more
productive to do all at once.

Anyway, done with this ticket. Bye.
