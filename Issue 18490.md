# Issue 18490: Clean up number_field/maps.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

The goal of this ticket is to clean up of the code in `sage/rings/number_field/maps.py`, which contains several unnecessary attributes and conversions.  One motivation for this is to simplify work on #252.

There are no changes in functionality.  The total running time of the doctests in `sage/rings/number_field` does not increase and even appears to decrease slightly.

It is possibly a bit faster because the cython function calls are faster than the python attribute calls? Anyways, LGTM.
