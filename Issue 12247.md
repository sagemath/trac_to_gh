humm, if you know git, this is simple. Otherwise, c'est moins simple.

there is the big developer manual, and in particular

https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/index.html#git-tricks-tips

in very short :

(1) clone the git repo and go to the develop branch

(2) set the remote to trac

(3) make a local branch on top of the develop branch

(4) push the branch to trac under u/your_trac_name/branch_name

(5) write that branch name in the ticket branch field
