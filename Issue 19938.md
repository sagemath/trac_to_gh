The idea is to use the cache options to implement a common used visualization for the Betsy-Ross matroid as seen in Oxley. Currently the show method gives a messy image, because of the default design principles.

This is just a starting ticket for me as a user. Currently I'm working on more of these enhancements. A few other special cases will follow soon.
