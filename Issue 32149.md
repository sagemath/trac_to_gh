Pynac has a compile-time dependency on the Python library but is not installed using Python package infrastructure. This is problematic because Python users cannot install it using standard Python tools - for example for testing different Python versions.

Pynac has no other uses than as the core of the symbolic expressions facility of Sage; and cannot even be tested without Sage.

We merge Pynac (i.e., the directory https://github.com/pynac/pynac/tree/master/ginac) into the Sage library as `src/sage/symbolic/ginac`. It is not a very big package - one flat directory with 100 *.h and *.cpp files, a total of 50kLOC. (The existing !Python/Cython symbolics code in `sage.symbolic`, `sage.calculus`, `sage.functions` is about 60kLOC.)

The Pynac sources are compiled like other C++ sources that are already in the Sage source tree. They are linked into a single Python extension module, `sage.symbolic.expression`. All other extension modules that used to link to pynac (`sage.libs.pynac.pynac`, `sage.symbolic.function`, `sage.symbolic.series` etc.) are 
- either refactored so that they only `import` helper functions provided by `sage.symbolic.expression` instead of having to `cimport` Pynac functions directly (see #32391, #32407)
- or merged into the extension module `sage.symbolic.expression` (via Cython `include` statements, not by copy-paste of source code, to keep the diff small)

This solves the same issues that #30534 tried to address, which ran into unresolved technical difficulties.

It will also make it easier for Sage developers to make changes to Pynac and the related symbolic implementation.

Follow-up: #32387 Remove pynac spkg

to all of those files (and the one doctest in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pxd` that raises an `ImportError` currently).

So this is basically working, but the correct linking is missing.

We could create an extra file `sage/symbolic/linked_pynac.pxd`, which just consists of

```
# distutils: extra_link_args = ...
from sage.symbolic/pynac cimport *
```

then there is no need to specify this extra distutils thing in every file that cimports pynac.

Thanks for the investigation and fixes.

I think I would be reluctant to use the `extra_link_args` workaround -- it will requires changes to the build system because now building one extension module would depend on another extension module.

In any case, I'd think that your successful experiment indicates the approach of merging everything that needs to `cimport` stuff from ginac/ into one extension module would work.

`from ... cimport ...` should usually just work out of the box. But of course one can also spell out all those header (e.g. with a cython alias).

This is a natural question. 

The pynac library just does not make sense as a module. It is the basis of the implementation of SR elements and as such there is no way to build Sage symbolics without it. 

In the modularization plan of #29705, we would instead create a distribution package `sagemath-symbolics`, containing the integrated pynac from the present ticket and most of `sage.symbolic`, `sage.calculus`, `sage.functions`, and parts of `sage.interfaces`. This will make sense as a module because there are many parts of Sage that (fortunately!) do not depend at all on Sage symbolics, or only depend on it for some smaller features. For example, `sage.graphs` has 0 imports from `sage.symbolic`, `sage.combinat` just a handful, etc.

The modularization plan does not involve "taking ... stuff out from Sage" at all. It will all remain in the same git repository, and also `src/sage` will remain monolithic.

FWIW, the change performed here did not introduced any speed regression in the rather demanding [Kerr spacetime notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr.ipynb), which involves parallelized (8 threads) heavy symbolic computations.
