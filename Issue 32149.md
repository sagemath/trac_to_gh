Pynac has a compile-time dependency on the Python library but is not installed using Python package infrastructure. This is problematic because Python users cannot install it using standard Python tools - for example for testing different Python versions.

Pynac has no other uses than as the core of the symbolic expressions facility of Sage; and cannot even be tested without Sage.

We merge Pynac (i.e., the directory https://github.com/pynac/pynac/tree/master/ginac) into the Sage library as `src/sage/symbolics/ginac`. It is not a very big package - one flat directory with 100 *.h and *.cpp files, a total of 50kLOC.

This will solve the same issues that #30534 tried to address, which ran into unresolved technical difficulties.

It will also make it easier for Sage developers to make changes to Pynac.

This problem with linking can likely be solved by merging all *.pyx files that `cimport` from `sage.symbolic.pynac` into one (taking care of the ones in `ring.pyx` by refactoring)

```
$ git grep pynac.*cimport
src/sage/symbolic/comparison.pyx:from sage.symbolic.pynac cimport (

```


to all of those files (and the one doctest in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pxd` that raises an `ImportError` currently).

So this is basically working, but the correct linking is missing.

We could create an extra file `sage/symbolic/linked_pynac.pxd`, which just consists of


```
# distutils: extra_link_args = ...
from sage.symbolic/pynac cimport *
```


then there is no need to specify this extra distutils thing in every file that cimports pynac.

Thanks for the investigation and fixes.

I think I would be reluctant to use the `extra_link_args` workaround -- it will requires changes to the build system because now building one extension module would depend on another extension module.

In any case, I'd think that your successful experiment indicates the approach of merging everything that needs to `cimport` stuff from ginac/ into one extension module would work.

`from ... cimport ...` should usually just work out of the box. But of course one can also spell out all those header (e.g. with a cython alias).

This is a natural question. 

The pynac library just does not make sense as a module. It is the basis of the implementation of SR elements and as such there is no way to build Sage symbolics without it.

The modularization plan does not involve "taking ... stuff out from Sage" at all. It will all remain in the same git repository, and also `src/sage` will remain monolithic.

Modularization is achieved by preparing sub-distributions defined using one of several possible mechanisms. Take a look at `sagemath-objects` from #29865 (https://pypi.org/project/sagemath-objects/), for example: It defines a sub-distribution using a `MANIFEST` file. Via the Python 3 "native namespace packages" mechanism, (after some work in #31420, #28925), these distributions can be installed cleanly next to each other and provide the shared `sage.*` namespace.

If I understand well, that means that when sage 9.5 enters Debian pynac can be let go.

Is that right?

FWIW, the change performed here did not introduced any speed regression in the rather demanding [Kerr spacetime notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Notebooks/SM_Kerr.ipynb), which involves parallelized (8 threads) heavy symbolic computations.
