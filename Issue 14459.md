[This ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/2619/2d-stem-plot) actually has some code for this. However, it probably makes more sense just to wrap [matplotlib's implementation](http://matplotlib.org/1.2.0/api/pyplot_api.html?highlight=stem#matplotlib.pyplot.stem) and unify its options with the others.
