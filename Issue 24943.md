# Issue 24943: py3: fixes to sage.dynamics

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25180

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-16 12:11:00

CC:  vdelecroix slelievre

Keywords: division richcmp

These fixes are mostly (entirely?) to code that is deprecated since #20695.  However, that was only merged fairly recently, so probably won't be removed for a while, so it still needs to be fixed if we want the Python 3 tests passing sooner rather than later.

Either way Vincent might also be interested in porting these fixes to his surface_dynamics package.
