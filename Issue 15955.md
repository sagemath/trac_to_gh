This needs to be rebased on latest develop. Now that #10194 is in sage, there is hope that this can enter too.

I rebased on the latest beta.

Adrien, do you want this to be reviewed ? Then change the status to "needs_review".

To solve some merge/rebase difficulties. We create a new branch with all the
code present in the branch (e8f9656e74f9c38ca1eb7285eba78019cbef6682).
