# Issue 11911: Add a TikZ-tex output method for 2d and 3d polytopes

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12083

Original creator: jipilab

Original creation time: 2011-11-25 17:31:49

Assignee: mhampton

Keywords: TikZ, polytope

I recently had to draw polytopes for my work.

Many drawing tools already exist. But none of them satisfied me.

So far, I wrote a method that takes a polytope in 3d and a view-angle (taken from Jmol) and outputs a .tex file containing a TikZ image of the polytope.

The method should also be able to deal with 2-polytopes.

The result is highly customizable: colors, edge style, vertices style, etc...

Do you have a ready patch already? Such functionality can be quite awesome in conjunction with SageTeX!


---

Comment by jipilab created at 2011-11-25 20:17:30

I just need to adapt the code a little bit. It is already mostly written and works with 'quite' big examples: A3,B3 and H3 permutahedra.

I just need to sit and do it: it should be there in a week or so...

1. Testing the file `polyhedra.py` creates junk in the working directory.


```
cd sage-4.8/devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry 
sage -t polyhedra.py
ls *.tex 
polytope-tikz.tex       polytope-tikz2.tex      polytope-tikz3.tex               
```


Saving files in your test is not necessary. I suggest you do the test like this instead :


```python
sage: P1 = polytopes.small_rhombicuboctahedron()   
sage: t = P1.tikz([1,3,5], 175, scale=4)           
sage: type(t)                                      
<type 'str'>                                       
sage: print '\n'.join(t.splitlines()[:4])          
\begin{tikzpicture}%                               
        [x={(-0.939161cm, 0.244762cm)},            
        y={(0.097442cm, -0.482887cm)},             
        z={(0.329367cm, 0.840780cm)},                                          
```


If you want to keep those line in the doc (a good idea a believe), I suggest you mark them as untested :


```
sage: open('polytope-tikz2.tex', 'w').write(Image2)    # not tested
```


2. You import `n` but you don't use it. (If you really needed it, I would have suggest to import the equivalent alias `numerical_approx` instead because the variable `n` is often used as an integer in the code...) But since you don't use it, just remove the import.


```diff
 from subprocess import Popen, PIPE                 
 from sage.misc.all import tmp_filename             
-from sage.misc.functional import norm              
+from sage.misc.functional import norm, n           
 from sage.misc.package import is_package_installed 
```


3. Testing the file `polyhedra.py` is not significantly longer than before : Great!

sage-4.8:


```
$ sage -t polyhedra.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py"
         [58.0 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------                 
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 58.0 seconds
```


sage-4.8 + your patch:

```
$ sage -t polyhedra.py
sage -t  "devel/sage-slabbe/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py"
         [58.6 s]
----------------------------------------------------------------------                 
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 58.6 seconds
```


4. You import VectorSpace but vector could do the job...


```diff
 from sage.modules.free_module_element import vector         
+from sage.modules.free_module import VectorSpace            
 from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix, identity_matrix 
```


In your code, you write :


```
V = VectorSpace(RDF,3) 
view_vector = V(view)  
```


I suggest you change this to :


```
view_vector = vector(RDF, view)
```


5. Every methods must have doctests:


```
$ sage -coverage polyhedra.py
----------------------------------------------------------------------
polyhedra.py
SCORE polyhedra.py: 98% (214 of 217)

Missing doctests:
         * _tikz_2d(self, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):
         * _tikz_2d_in_3d(self, view, rot_angle, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):
         * _tikz_3d_in_3d(self, view, rot_angle, scale, edge_color, facet_color, opacity, vertex_color, axis):

----------------------------------------------------------------------

```


6. I tested my script `tikz2pdf` on the above 3 junk tex files created by the doctest. Pdf files were created without problem. Pictures look great!

7. Building the documentation creates 2 warnings :


```
$ sage -docbuild reference html
...
/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-4.8/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py:docstring
of sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron.tikz:26: WARNING: Inline literal
start-string without end-string.
/Users/slabbe/Applications/sage-4.8/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/geometry/polyhedra.py:docstring
of sage.geometry.polyhedra.Polyhedron.tikz:27: WARNING: Inline literal
start-string without end-string.
...
```


I believe the problem comes from this :


```diff
+            2) Select ``Console`;        
+            3) Select the tab ``State`;  
```


8. Change this 


```
            It read something like:
                                             
            moveto 0.0 {x y z angle} Scale   
```


to


```
            It read something like::
                                             
                moveto 0.0 {x y z angle} Scale   
```


It will look nicer in the documentation.

9. I suggest to change the variable name `rot_angle` to `angle`.

10. Input block do not follow the coding convention.

See www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/conventions.html

I suggest you follow this example :


```
    INPUT:

     - ``x`` - integer (default: 1) the description of the
       argument x goes here.  If it contains multiple lines, all
       the lines after the first need to be indented.

     - ``y`` - integer (default: 2) the ...

    OUTPUT:

    integer -- the ...
```


So, first say what is the type. Then, say what is the default (inside ```` quotes. Then, give the description.

For the output, just say the type and what it is. The part ```tikz_pic``` is not necessary.

11. The description of `view` argument could be improved.


```
- ``view`` -- a list of length 3 representing a vector; 
```


I know it is a vector. Is it the camera position? Is it the view angle? Is it the axis for the rotation?

12. I think the type of what you return should be a `LatexExpr` instead of `str`. 


```
from sage.misc.latex import LatexExpr
```


Compare `latex(Image1)` to `latex(LatexExpr(Image1))`. Because, sagetex
will call `latex` function on your output...


Bonne fête !

I really like this functionality and I thought I'd help by rebasing the patch to sage-5.0, but I have now run out of time.  Working on this reminded me of some things I don't like about the Projection class, but I am not sure about the best way to fix them.  I think projections should be more accessible from Polyhedron objects, and vice-versa.  Anyway, I did complete a patch for sage-5.0 that manages to pass the original tests, but its not very pretty.  Its inefficient, and relies on a parent_polyhedron method for projections that might be objectionable.  But since it works, it might be helpful in creating a better version.

If no one else does, I might have time to revisit this in a week or so.

So - which patches have to be applied? I suspect they'll need rebasing after all Volker's refactoring.

So, today I used the reviewed patch to draw a polytope using the library decorations of tikz.

I realized that I was sloppy to implement the edges; they are drawn twice. This also makes the compilation in LaTeX slower.

I will write a patch for version 5.3 that does not have repetitions (and containing the improvements in the rebased version).

Rebased version of the tikz method


---

Attachment

So, here is the rebased version of the patch.

I solved a few problems:
The vertices and edges appeared twice before (sloppy implementation);
There was one vertex not drawn in the first (unholy) rebased version;
The facets were badly drawn (problem with vertices naming in the code);
The back edges were badly recognized.

I looked at the compiled tikz output examples and now everything seems in order.

All tests passed on 5.4.1

One thing I don't really like though is the fact that we need to pass to projections to access the tikz method. Perhaps a wrapper would do the thing?

For the bot:

Comment by chapoton created at 2013-03-03 10:18:30

There is a problem with the lines

```
            v1 = self.coords[index1]
            v2 = self.coords[index2]
```

which appear three times, but the variables v1 and v2 are never used.

Moreover, three tests are failing on sage 5.8.beta1

This patch should probably be rebased. It would be nice to add in the ticket's description which patch are to be applied, too.

The PDF doc doesn't build:

```
! Package inputenc Error: Keyboard character used is undefined
(inputenc)                in inputencoding `utf8'.

See the inputenc package documentation for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

                                          \leavevmode
```

To fix this, use `r"""` docstrings instead of `"""`.

I just want to say that I could have used this a couple years ago and instead had to do lots of guess-and-check with graph plots, then convert to xfig... thank you, this will be very useful!
