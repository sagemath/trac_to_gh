by dropping `usage()`.


I don't think it's necessary to expose this in the Sage interface. Its doctest fails for Debian at least (where tachyon's usage screen has been patched?) If people are in IPython or a Jupyter notebook, they can just type `!tachyon` to see the same information. In theory this breaks the existing interface but I am quite sure nobody is relying on this.

I think we can live without the pager feature. The output is only 82 lines. That's not too much for people to scroll I think.

This upstreams part of Debian's `u2-fix-trivial-test-cases.patch` btw.

The patchbot fails due to a problem in the cygwin build that is unrelated to this ticket's changes. This still needs review.
