The script package `r_jupyter` (from #19427), which installs the Jupyter R kernel, needs to be supplied with an SPKG.txt that explains what it is.

This is so that `./sage -info r_jupyter` works.

We now generate a manual section from each SPKG, so having a description of this package would be valuable

Here is a branch providing files `SPKG.rst` and `dependencies`
for the optional package `r_jupyter`. Please review.
