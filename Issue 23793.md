Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24030

Cusp forms of weight 1 are hard, but Eisenstein forms are not especially harder in weight 1 than in any other weight, and all our Eisenstein functionality is supposed to work fine with weight 1. However, something funny happens with GammaH levels:

```
ModularForms(Gamma1(9), 1).dimension() # works
4 
ModularForms(GammaH(9, [4]), 1).dimension() # boom
