# Issue 10022: Compute Hilbert basis of cone

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10023

The Hilbert basis of a cone is useful for toric geometry since one needs to know the generators of "sigma-dual intersect M". This patch implements not necessarily reduced generators of a cone and the Hilbert basis.

A couple little picks after glancing at it:
 * No date after the last "AUTHORS" entry.
 * `Cone.generators()` seems very confusing to me - I think of cones as generated by their rays. Maybe `Cone.lattice_points_generators()`? I know, it is quite long, but just `lattice_generators` or `integral_generators` are still misleading...

How about `Cone.semigroup_generators()`? This is closer to the truth :-)

Great!

I've added a `Hilbert_coefficients(point)` method that will expand `point` into a non-negative integer linear combination of the Hilbert basis.

There are doctest errors according to the buildbot, looks like sorting is changed in the new version.

Hi Volker, I've formatted the documentation a little and adjusted conversion logic in the `semigroup_generators` (some conversions were unnecessary and for simplicial cones it was returning a list, rather than tuple).

If all changes look fine, please switch to positive review!
