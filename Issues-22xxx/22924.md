Various cleaning to the linbox interface (`sage.libs.linbox`) and Sage dense integer matrices (`sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense`).

- implement a more direct linbox/flint interface in `sage/libs/linbox/linbox_flint_interface.pyx` (supersedes part of `linbox-sage.C` inside linbox)

- remove all mpz pointers from `Matrix_integer_dense` (that is the attributes
  `bint _initialized_mpz`, `mpz_t * _entrie` and `mpz_t ** _rows`) as
  well as the associated constructors/destructors (`int _init_mpz(self)`, `int _init_mpz_impl(self)`, `int _init_linbox(self)`, `void _dealloc_mpz(self)`)

- fix the following error

```
sage: matrix(ZZ, 2).det(algorithm='padic')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ImportError: No module named matrix_integer_dense_hnf
```

- add more examples and tests to the documentation

(see #22872 for the linbox task ticket)

Great.
Let's start with a few remarks:
1. Why do need the dependency on #22886 ? That ticket is stalled and is therefore also blocking this one.
2. While we are changing a lot of stuff, I wouldn't mind getting rid of these ugly `poly_linbox` method, with a string parameter `typ` that determines whether to compute minpoly or charpoly. We should rather only have the 2 methods `_minpoly_linbox_` and `_charpoly_linbox_`. There is not much duplicated code between these two, especially now after this clean-up.

Thanks for having a look!

I think that Cython compilation fails otherwise (I am trying again right now on top of 8.0.beta4... will take some time since I need to recompile the whole Sage after playing with #22493).

>  2. While we are changing a lot of stuff, I wouldn't mind getting rid of these ugly `poly_linbox` method, with a string parameter `typ` that determines whether to compute minpoly or charpoly. We should rather only have the 2 methods `_minpoly_linbox_` and `_charpoly_linbox_`. There is not much duplicated code between these two, especially now after this clean-up.


The ticket only intends to clean `matrix_integer_dense.pyx`. The two functions you mention are actually removed from `matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` but kept in `libs/linbox/linbox_flint_interface.pyx` (but note that the argument there is an integer). I can get rid of the following function in the interface

```
# set p to the minpoly or the charpoly of A
cdef inline void linbox_fmpz_mat_poly(fmpz_poly_t p, fmpz_mat_t A, int minpoly)
```
Is that what you want?

Ok sorry for the confusion. My remark indeed applies to the new `libs/linbox_flint_interface.pyx`.
Sure, it should definitely not be exposed through the new interface as it is an internal trick to factor out code. Then I also suggest to avoid this trick and simply write the two methods for the sake of clarity.

It's a super old comment. Some archeology on trac tickets should tell where it comes from but it's safe to remove it.

There are a couple of warnings that one could avoid:

```
Basically, the variables are passed as "out" arguments, and cython complains that they are not initialized. It is safe to force their value to 0 at declaration (e.g. `int res = 0;`) and this would silence out the warning.

```

I dropped it.

It would be fine for me to use `degree` however it is horribly complicated. Why is there a class `Degree` that is a trivial wrapper around a `int64_t`? Why could we not use `degree` directly as a method of a polynomial?

My mistake. Givaro actually resizes the 0 polynomial to an empty vector, so `size-1` is always equal to the degree.

After a discussion with J-G. Dumas on the topic here are a few clarifications:
* the degree can be accessed in two ways: 
   1. either through `Poly1Dom<..>::degree which silently resize the vector when there are leading zeros.
   2. direcrly by `P.size()-1`  when the programmer knows what she does and does not want to pay the price of a resize.

 So it's fine to do it with `size()-1` as in this ticket, since we know the polynomials handed by LinBox have correct size in this case.
* The class `Degree` was meant to provide a distinct type than the int64_t returned by size, in order to avoid mixing both approaches. Still the class is not quite satisfactory for the moment (degree (0 + 0)=-2 != -1). This has been fixed upstream in [https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/commit/756005d0be64c36513c57403b856d93fc43c8010](https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/commit/756005d0be64c36513c57403b856d93fc43c8010)
