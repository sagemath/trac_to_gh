Yes.

No. The point is to reduce the patching, i.e. reduce the diff between the real autodoc and the Sage autodoc.

Ideally, we should eventually reduce the diff to zero (by fixing Sage and/or Sphinx).

It all started a very long time ago as a fork of the Sphinx autodoc. Many changes have been made, some upstream changes were merged. It's not meaningful to say that it is a fork of a single upstream commit, it's much messier than that.

When I created this ticket, Sage was using Sphinx 1.5.3 so I guess it's best to compare against that: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/v1.5.3/sphinx/ext/autodoc.py
