Running

```python
integrate(floor(x), x, 0, infinity, algorithm='sympy')
```
returns

```python
integrate(floor(x), x, 0, +Infinity)
```
and trying

```python
integrate(floor(x), x, 0, infinity, algorithm='sympy').n()
```
returns (!!!) `-679.7441466712775`. This is awfully wrong. It shows with any unevaluated integral.

I don't think this is correct:

```
sage: integrate((1+x+x^2)^(1/3), x, 0, infinity)
integrate((x^2 + x + 1)^(1/3), x, 0, +Infinity)
sage: _.n()
8.835093500042741e+20
