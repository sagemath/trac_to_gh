A follow up to #22310. As promised there, this switch makes even full-dimensional polytopes faster, on the same example we now get

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices()).facet_normals()")
625 loops, best of 3: 976 µs per loop
```
The reason is that dimension computation used to be quite complicated.

Next in the chain of lattice polytope improvements is #22524

Depends on #22310

I am guessing what happened is @sagetrac-ursula just used the branch, effectively downgrading her version of Sage to that of the branch, and ran `sage -b`, which does not rebuild the necessary parts of Sage. In general, I always make sure to merge it ontop of (my version of) `develop` to avoid regressing Sage (which will include long compilation time). If that is not what [@ursula] did, then try running `make build` and then `sage -t`.",

It also works for me. I am guessing what happened is @sagetrac-ursula just used the branch, effectively downgrading her version of Sage to that of the branch, and ran `sage -b`, which does not rebuild the necessary parts of Sage. In general, I always make sure to merge it ontop of (my version of) `develop` to avoid regressing Sage (which will include long compilation time). If that is not what [@ursula] did, then try running `make build` and then `sage -t`.

Thank you!!!

Of course your changes look good - anything to get it in ;-) A small question however:

```
         TypeError: the point M(1, 1) and
-        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N have incompatible lattices!
+         2-d cone in 2-d lattice N have incompatible lattices
```
Your new line apart from dropping the exclamation point due to exception formatting change also adds a space in front of the second part of the broken line. Is this also the style recommended somewhere? I can't recall ever reading it.
