A follow up to #22310. As promised there, this switch makes even full-dimensional polytopes faster, on the same example we now get

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices()).facet_normals()")
625 loops, best of 3: 976 µs per loop
```
The reason is that dimension computation used to be quite complicated.

Next in the chain of lattice polytope improvements is #22524

Depends on #22310

I successfully installed this patch and tried some variants on the example.  Speed seems to work as advertised:

```
sage: sim = ReflexivePolytope(3,0)
sage: timeit("sim.facet_normals()")
625 loops, best of 3: 576 ns per loop
```

I made some small formatting changes to more match our style guide. If my changes look good, then positive review.

Thank you!!!

Of course your changes look good - anything to get it in ;-) A small question however:

```
         TypeError: the point M(1, 1) and
-        2-d cone in 2-d lattice N have incompatible lattices!
+         2-d cone in 2-d lattice N have incompatible lattices
```
Your new line apart from dropping the exclamation point due to exception formatting change also adds a space in front of the second part of the broken line. Is this also the style recommended somewhere? I can't recall ever reading it.
