I made the following changes to the "Create your own coding theory classes" thematic tutorial located at
https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/structures_in_coding_theory.html#structures-in-coding-theory


repetition_code.py requires the line
`from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor import FiniteField as GF`

Import statements such as
`from repetition_code.py import BinaryRepetitionCode`
were changed to
`from sage.coding.repetition_code.py import BinaryRepetitionCode`

Quick comments. I will let David handle the main review:

- Use your real name in the author block.
