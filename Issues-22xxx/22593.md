For some reason, `setuptools` stopped working for me in 7.6.rc0:

```

  Running setup.py (path:/tmp/pip-c8S0GC-build/setup.py) egg_info for package from file:///usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pip-8.1.2.p1/src
    Running command python setup.py egg_info
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/tmp/pip-c8S0GC-build/setup.py", line 91, in <module>
        cmdclass={'test': PyTest},
      File "/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python/distutils/core.py", line 111, in setup
        _setup_distribution = dist = klass(attrs)
      File "/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools/dist.py", line 289, in __init__
        except (packaging.version.InvalidVersion, TypeError):
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'version'
Cleaning up...
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-c8S0GC-build/
```

Looking at the sources, it is obvious why: `packaging.version` is not automatically imported. So it only works if `packaging.version` was accidentally imported somewhere else. This seems to be fixed in a newer version of `setuptools`.

Note: setuptools-34 decided to stop vendoring many packages that it needs (for example `six`). This leads to lots of problems, so I decided to go for version 33.1.1, which is the latest working version.
