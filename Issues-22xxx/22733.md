In a fresh Sage:

```
sage: var('a b c c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 d i j m n p r k u x y z')
(a, b, c, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, d, i, j, m, n, p, r, k, u, x, y, z)
sage: a.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: b.series(x)
(b)

sage: var('z0 z')
(z0, z)
sage: z0.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: z.series(x)
(z)

sage: var('z0 z')
(z0, z)
sage: z.series(x)
1*x + Order(x^20)
sage: z0.series(x)
(z0)
```
It seems to always affect the first call to series.
