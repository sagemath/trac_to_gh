This addresses three issues:

1) HTTPS is used to access the current CDN

2) Transparency is only set for opacity less that unity and the unnecessary depth write test is removed

3) A transparency issue for scenes with multiple objects is fixed by reseting mesh positions appropriately. This issue exists in the current implementation `threejs` on the cell server for objects created from `IndexFaceSet`

> So - what else needs work for these issues?

Nothing for the issues already identified, but there is an outstanding transparency issue that I just figured out how to fix yesterday. I changed the status of the ticket so that no one would need to review it twice. The solution to this third issue is a bit involved and I want to clean up the code before pushing it here.
> Regarding embedding this template as iframe - perhaps it would be better to have a visible border of the plot, given that it changes mouse behaviour? Nothing drastic, thin gray line would suffice.

The embedding is controlled [server side](https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/blob/develop/backend_cell.py#L133) so you can make that change any time. This ticket will only touch JavaScript.

In any case, that's beyond the scope of this ticket.

Break all complicated objects into something like 1000 little triangles so that they almost never will intersect and when they do, defects will be small?

OK, it does improve the transparency situation! Can you please clarify multiplication by -1?

Continuing overall discussion - do I understand correctly that say several nested cylinders with the same parameters except for radius will not be drawn correctly ever??? And WebGL has no interest in fixing this situation? If so, what can be a sensible automatic workaround? Break all complicated objects into something like 1000 little triangles so that they almost never will intersect and when they do, defects will be small? Or we just hope that such situations are rare? Even a simple cube looks strange with opacity - as you rotate it it is obvious that facets are different! And they aren't exactly intersecting each other, just touching.

No, but the process will be difficult to automate. The is an additional parameter named `renderOrder` that can be manually attached to objects to help in these sorts of situations. It would be easy enough to add the feature but would take some explaining for people to understand why it might help.

Part of the reason to use Three.js is avoid having to learn too much about WebGL, but I guess now I'm committed to getting more details. I do know that the depth buffer that tracks object position does not respect transparency and that's the source of the problem. Here's an [example](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJyNzrEKwyAUheG90HdwU9ubQiwZ77MUSW6IxaCoSdSnbxw6Frr9y-E7uw6CZ1ZY5fJ68T1DZlZvzWjSy1uXnpOoiKpTtwwiQ6dASRDlG7XFIMF5fS4KPgbYDR0UkKclEL0jhznolXDWNhLoTBFT2Khh6gf2NzU6604p0NTOx8Udwvd3r-QH0vM_uQ==&lang=sage) that I think encapsulates that: rotate the planes vertically and you see how the transparency of each half shifts based on which one's center is closest to the front of the scene.

I don't yet know more details of the implementation, but I assume a choice had to be made to get 3D rendering to work at all in the browser, where resources are more limited than with a Java desktop environment. That might change as browsers gain calculational power.

This is partly a result of the existing lighting. In order to get things started I just put lights above and below the frame, but we can change the default lighting. The current `threejs` implementation has lights from six directions IIRC: does it look better to you for a single cube?

Great example!
