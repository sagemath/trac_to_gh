```
This addresses three issues:

1) HTTPS is used to access the current CDN

2) Transparency is only set for opacity less that unity and the unnecessary depth write test is removed

3) A transparency issue for scenes with multiple objects is fixed by reseting mesh positions appropriately. This issue exists in the current implementation `threejs` on the cell server for objects created from `IndexFaceSet`

> So - what else needs work for these issues?

Nothing for the issues already identified, but there is an outstanding transparency issue that I just figured out how to fix yesterday. I changed the status of the ticket so that no one would need to review it twice. The solution to this third issue is a bit involved and I want to clean up the code before pushing it here.
> Regarding embedding this template as iframe - perhaps it would be better to have a visible border of the plot, given that it changes mouse behaviour? Nothing drastic, thin gray line would suffice.

The embedding is controlled [server side](https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/blob/develop/backend_cell.py#L133) so you can make that change any time. This ticket will only touch JavaScript.

How could one implement it in a sensible way? Compute intersections of all sub-pieces on adding plots?

Perhaps it would make more sense to subdivide all planes into smaller pieces, or at least have some option for this?

My comment was meant as an advisory to the end user and I can add something like it to the documentation for this viewer if desired. I should have been clearer since there are really two issues:

1) Compact objects need to have different positions for transparency to render properly.

2) Intersecting extended objects will have transparency issues even with different positions. It will be most immediately noticeable for planes but will exist for other objects, such as cylinders. This is an issue with WebGL in general, not just Three.js.

By the time the objects get to Three.js they're just vertices and faces, so the splitting would have to happen in Python, at least in `implicit_plot3d` and `parametric_plot3d`. Again, this is only for transparent objects as seen from certain angles, so I think we should wait and see how much of a problem it is for end users before making any complicated changes.

In any case, that's beyond the scope of this ticket.

Part of the reason to use Three.js is avoid having to learn too much about WebGL, but I guess now I'm committed to getting more details. I do know that the depth buffer that tracks object position does not respect transparency and that's the source of the problem. Here's an [example](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJyNzrEKwyAUheG90HdwU9ubQiwZ77MUSW6IxaCoSdSnbxw6Frr9y-E7uw6CZ1ZY5fJ68T1DZlZvzWjSy1uXnpOoiKpTtwwiQ6dASRDlG7XFIMF5fS4KPgbYDR0UkKclEL0jhznolXDWNhLoTBFT2Khh6gf2NzU6604p0NTOx8Udwvd3r-QH0vM_uQ==&lang=sage) that I think encapsulates that: rotate the planes vertically and you see how the transparency of each half shifts based on which one's center is closest to the front of the scene.

This is partly a result of the existing lighting. In order to get things started I just put lights above and below the frame, but we can change the default lighting. The current `threejs` implementation has lights from six directions IIRC: does it look better to you for a single cube?
