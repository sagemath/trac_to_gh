Debian (and I'm sure other distros)'s autobuilders run with unset DISPLAY, and the tests fail without this patch.

Debian is on matplotlib v2 and Sage is still using v1.5 (see [our status page](https://people.debian.org/~thansen/debian-sage-7.4-status.html)).

I did initially also add it into other places, but only these two were needed in the end to fix the test failures. Perhaps it runs the other plots after running these tests, so the "good" settings have already been set by then?

Agreed that this is best done in the main code itself; probably not even in the doctest engine, but the Sage-matplotlib interface. I'm not certain where would be the best place though, I'm not familiar with the code.

Looks like upstream rejected my suggestion. I can't reproduce this now on my main computer either, but I'll try it again in Debian's build-in-a-chroot program later.

`env -i PATH=/usr/bin:/bin HOME=$HOME sage -c 'plot(x^2, (x,0,5))'`

They did point me to the `MPLBACKEND` envvar so perhaps Sage's doctesting framework can set this envvar, assuming the "real cause" isn't something else.

It appears that #23696 fixed this:

```
+# Make sure the agg backend is selected during doctesting
+# This needs to be done before any other matplotlib calls.
+import matplotlib
+matplotlib.use('agg')
```
So, can this be closed now?
