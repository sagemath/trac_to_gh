This is a perfect example were the libraries need to be after the objects needed them in some linkers.

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

`--add-needed` is necessary for the extra `libm` we install on FreeBSD, and which is linked to the "real" `libm`.

By the way, 

```
-+	$(MAKE) libLfunction$(LIBEXT)
-+	$(MAKE) lcalc$(EXEEXT)
++	$(MAKE) libLfunction.so
++	$(MAKE) lcalc
```
looks too optimistic for OSX, don't we get `.dynlib` rather than `.so`, and too optimistic for Cygwin, where we get `.exe` for executables.

If you look at the original Makefile.patch you will note that `$(EXEEXT)` has never been appended to `example` neither here or the earlier rule to build it. Neither did you in your patch revision. Nothing in spkg-install or spkg-build will ever call that target, it has only been amended for some measure of consistency but someone (probably working on cygwin) didn't see the point in adding that bit.
