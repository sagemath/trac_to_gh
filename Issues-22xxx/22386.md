As I see it, the current table of contents of the reference manual needs some rearrangement.

In the patch, I tried to arrange the mathematics topics such that those basic and having wider interest come first and those more advanced and having narrow interest come later.

I agree. I put that there because I thought "algebraic structures" are more mathematically *basic* than "rings and fields". Where do you think is better place for "algebraic structures"? 

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the TOC than to make it perfect, which I think is impossible as we all may have different ideas...

Some thoughts:

* I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

I moved `Symbolic Logic` to under `Discrete Mathematics` as suggested.

It is controversial if we could see cryptography as a branch of discrete mathematics in traditional sense. I personally do not agree.
 
> I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?


The title `Basic infrastructure` is short and appropriate to keep the list under it. I would keep it.

> What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?


Done.

> What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 


Done. Also `Probability and statistics` still follows it.

> I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.


`Numerical optimization` section seems to require a rearrangement on its own level. This ticket is not intended for that. I will open a separate one so that further discussions could be carried on there.

<a id='comment:22'></a>Thanks for the changes. I agree that the Numerical Optimization issues can be considered as beyond this ticket.

I see your point, and I won't insist on anything. One could, however, see the role of cryptography in the mathematics software Sage as being the discrete mathematics side of cryptography. There is no numerical side to crypto, for instance.

It is certainly short but not appropriate. The heading "Basic infrastructure" sounds like something I shouldn't care about as a user (together with Parent, Element, the coercion framework and all that jazz). In complete opposition to this, it is *immensely* useful for a user to know the basic mathematical data structures. Besides, would you really look under the heading `Basic Infrastructure` for `Subset`?

<a id='comment:26'></a>OK, I'd like to propose few more changes.

* rename: Calculus -> Calculus and Analysis
* move Numerical Optimization to  Calculus and Analysis
* move Cryprography and SAT Solvers to Discrete Mathematics
* remove the heading Special Topics (as it's empty after these moves).

Otherwise it looks better already...
