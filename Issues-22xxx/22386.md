As I see it, the current table of contents of the reference manual needs some rearrangement.

In the patch, I tried to arrange the mathematics topics such that those basic and having wider interest come first and those more advanced and having narrow interest come later.

I agree. I put that there because I thought "algebraic structures" are more mathematically *basic* than "rings and fields". Where do you think is better place for "algebraic structures"? 

The purpose of this ticket is to improve the TOC than to make it perfect, which I think is impossible as we all may have different ideas...

<a id='comment:17'></a>Good idea to review this index.

Some thoughts:

* Does it really make sense that `Cryptography` is not listed under the same headline as `Coding Theory`? Why not put `Cryptography`, `Symbolic Logic`, and `SAT Solvers` under `Discrete Mathematics`?

* I now realise that clicking on `Basic Infrastructure` goes to an index with the immensely useful list of `Mathematical Data Structures`. Perhaps the headline should therefore instead be `Core infrastructure and Mathematical Data structures`?

* What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?

* What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 

* I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.

It's a weird mix of discrete optimization (Knapsack)--- out of place there, as it's not "numerical", but discrete, with numerical root finding, least squares approximation, and optimization of functions of one variable, and linear (LP), integer linear (ILP)---again, a discrete problem--- and semidefinite programming (SDP).

By right, LP and SDP should be put into its own "Convex optimization", Knapsack and ILP into "Discrete optimization", and univariate things into "Calculus/numerical methods". I also think that the code for the latter and for Knapsack should be split into separate files - currently they are all dumped in `numerical/optimize.py`, which also contains a little function to demonstrate the direct use of `cvxopt` LP solver---the latter should also be somewhere else. 

Note that ILP and LP are solved by the same frontend, specifying appropriate parameters, so I don't quite know how to structure the corresponding documentation.
(Probably one would have to link to `.rst` files that further point at the concrete code documentation?)

I moved `Symbolic Logic` to under `Discrete Mathematics` as suggested.

It is controversial if we could see cryptography as a branch of discrete mathematics in traditional sense. I personally do not agree.

The title `Basic infrastructure` is short and appropriate to keep the list under it. I would keep it.

> What about putting `Other Algebraic Structures` after `Discrete Mathematics`?


Done.

> What about putting `Calculus` earlier, right after `Linear Algebra` -- most students will use Sage for calculus. 


Done. Also `Probability and statistics` still follows it.

> I agree with Dima that `Numberical Optimization` is a weird category that I can't figure out where should go, but that it is semantically linked to SAT Solvers. Perhaps they should simply have their own headline called `Solvers` or something.


`Numerical optimization` section seems to require a rearrangement on its own level. This ticket is not intended for that. I will open a separate one so that further discussions could be carried on there.
