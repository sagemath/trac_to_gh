Isn't **"destroys"** a bit of an overstatement?

I find it a bit confusing to have a directory with the same name as a command. How about using `new_copy` for the directory name instead of `merge`?

Also, having a branch name with slashes looks to me like a subfolder in the branch. How about calling it `some_code` instead of `some/code`?

Changed, but to "new_worktree", as I find "new_copy" ambiguous.
