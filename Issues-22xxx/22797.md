Consider the following:

```
sage: a = RDF(pi)
sage: a              # Same as repr() of a Python float: shortest string that will evaluate back to the same float
3.141592653589793
sage: a.str()        # Same as str() of a Python float
'3.14159265359'
sage: RR(a)          # mpfr_get_str() with less digits than default
3.14159265358979
sage: RR(a).str()    # mpfr_get_str() with 0 digits
'3.1415926535897931'
```
Questions:

1) why does `a` not give the same output as `a.str()` (without the quotes)?

2) why does RDF output one more digit than RR (and two less with the `str` method)?

Sorry, I misread your question. The problem is that there are various things here: `repr(x)` vs. `x.str()` vs. `str(x)` (which you didn't mention but could be relevant) and `RR` vs. `RDF`.

So your question 2) is about the difference in `repr(x)` between `RR` and `RDF`.

For `RDF`, we use the `repr` function from Python floats. This returns the shortest decimal expansion which will give the original number back when doing `RDF("the string")`. In particular, 2 different numbers are guaranteed to have diffent string representations.

For `RR`, we arbitrarily decide to show a little bit less digits to avoid too many questions about rounding issues. You know, things like

```
sage: 0.1 + 0.2
0.300000000000000
sage: RDF(0.1) + RDF(0.2)
0.30000000000000004
```

There is a comment in the code

```python
            # This avoids the confusion a lot of people have with the last
            # 1-2 binary digits being wrong due to rounding coming from
            # representing numbers in binary.
```
and the feature was added in

```

Author: William Stein <wstein@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 28 13:28:44 2006 -0500

    Made _assign_names something only do once; new inject_variables system; lots of documenation
```

```

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

in my opinion, it would be better if RR would also print 16 significant digits, for two
reasons:

1) consistency with RDF

2) like for RDF, we could write `RR("the string")` to get back the number, and two
   different numbers would be guaranteed to have different string representations.

Besides, note that the `0.1 + 0.2` issue still happens:

```
sage: 1.2-1.1
0.0999999999999999
```
