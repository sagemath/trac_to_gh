```python
(x==17).subs(x=19).plot()
```
plots a line at height 2.  In general, replacing 17 with **a** and 19 with **b** results in a line at height **b-a**.

This is of course silly, as if one wishes to plot the function **a == b**, it should probably be at height 1 if indeed **a=b**, or at height 0 otherwise.

Keywords: **bool, expression, plot**

This at least is not a bug.  Sage should plot the same thing for `x^2+1` and `x^2+1==0`, if it plots anything at all, as in other contexts they are considered the same.  However, I'm not sure if anything should be plotted here.

See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx#L11388 for where this is defined.  This is very old code, so it may take some work to get right.  Note that the subs you point out gives `19 == 17` which then https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/ext/fast_callable.pyx interprets as 2.

But I don't know that I'd interpret `19==17` as either 1 or 0, as we don't plot truth values, we plot numbers.
