LGTM:

```
sage: R.<p> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(p^2-2)
sage: phi = K.coerce_map_from(int)
sage: phi
Composite map:
  From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
  To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial p^2 - 2
  Defn:   Native morphism:
          From: Set of Python objects of type 'int'
          To:   Integer Ring
        then
          Natural morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Number Field in a with defining polynomial p^2 - 2
sage: z = int(5)
sage: %timeit phi(z)
The slowest run took 16.55 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.51 µs per loop
sage: %timeit phi(z)
The slowest run took 15.68 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.47 µs per loop
