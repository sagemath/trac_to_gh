```

Reason one is that for the negativity check of a `PyObject` Pynac checks if it's real and if so, call a Python LT compare with 0. The reality check already should fail.

```
sage: RR('NaN').is_real()    # bug
True
sage: NaN.is_real()
False
```
Secondly, coercion of `RR('NaN')` into `SR` should return the symbolic constant `NaN` which does not have these problems. The ticket should fix both.

I'm not convinced about

```
if x == RR('NaN')
```
I would prefer to see a type-specific check. For example, `Integer` can never be `NaN`. And for `float` or `complex`, it seems overkill to involve the coercion model just to check whether the value is `NaN`. And for elements of `RR`, you could use the `is_NaN()` method.
