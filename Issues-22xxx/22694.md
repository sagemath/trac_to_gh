I'm consistently getting these test failures in this module on my Cygwin branch (just rebased on the latest develop branch, but I've had this for a couple weeks now):

I can reproduce this outside the test suite as well.  The same code works fine without parallel processing, so my guess is a problem in the parallel processing itself (though the tests for `sage.parallel` itself all pass).

By the way, I've made significant progress in getting to the bottom of this.  The full traceback leading up to the SIGABRT is attached.

But the main issue here seems to have to do with libgc's handling of threads in the child process after a fork, on Cygwin.  In principle libgc explicitly supports Cygwin, but there still seems to be a bug somewhere related to this (or possibly just a build issue though I haven't found that to be the case yet...).  I'm trying to boil it down to a simpler test case, but the issue seems to be that for one reason or another the post-fork handler is either not running at all, or not working properly, because in the forked process it's leaving behind a reference to a thread from the parent process, which has a handle to a native (Windows) thread that is no longer valid in the child process.  The `pthread_atfork` handler for the child process should have removed that thread but it doesn't.

A possible short-term workaround might be to compile libgc with threads disabled on Cygwin, but I don't know what other impacts that would have.

Confirmed that building libgc with `./configure --enable-threads=none` works around this particular issue.

But I'd still like to get to the bottom of this; ISTM like it might be a simple bug at the end of the day.

I've attached a patch to Sage to configure GC to work properly on Cygwin.  I've also made an upstream report, but only to suggest that the default configuration for Cygwin should incorporate this (since it's broken otherwise).  I don't think there's a great way to work around the issue in the code *without* using `pthread_atfork` that doesn't incur too much overhead.
