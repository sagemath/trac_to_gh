Currently, the method `_sage_doc_` is used to implement custom documentation for instances of a class. Such a use case makes sense, but it should be implemented as the `__doc__` attribute instead of the Sage-specific `_sage_doc_`.

I tried various ways of implementing this and I found several Cython bugs along the way. The current solution is not the cleanest, but it works in all cases (Cython and Python, extension types and normal classes).

In the cases where `_sage_doc_` was implemented for a base class, this patch requires adding ``@`instancedoc` to every subclass. This is because Python never inherits the `__doc__` attribute. There is a way around this using a metaclass, but I avoided that because metaclasses have their own problems (see #21681).

<a id='comment:16'></a>Right.  For example, in classes with the `ABCMeta` metaclass, if there are any unimplemented `abstractproperty` or `abstractmethod`, trying to instantiate the class results in:

```
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class A with abstract methods foo
```

This is a slightly different case of course, since it's an error that would occur at class definition time.  I was just using this as an example of a clearer error message.

<a id='comment:18'></a>I replaced `InstanceDoc` with `instancedoc` (I didn't use `instance_doc` just because the method name `_instancedoc_` doesn't have an underscore either. And anyway, Python uses `staticmethod` and not `static_method`.)
