The package `perl_term_readline_gnu` fails to install on archlinux with gcc 6.3.1. See the attached [perl_term_readline_gnu-1.34.log](https://trac.sagemath.org/attachment/ticket/22505/perl_term_readline_gnu-1.34.log).

(note: I do have everything I need on my system and disabling the installation just make everything else works)
