As reported on [sage-release](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/HO7UR2sqmTM/KzySa1rWCwAJ):

```
rm -f logs/pkgs/sqlite.log
sage -t src/sage/tests/cmdline.py
ls logs/pkgs/sq*
```

creates file

```
logs/pkgs/sqlite.log
```

... which is not a log file at all.

I believe that the log file is created by the line

```
sage: out, err, ret = test_executable(["sage", "-p", "--info", "--info", "sqlite"])
```
Indeed, running `sage --info sqlite` just prints the `SPKG.txt` file to the screen, while `sage -p --info sqlite` also dumps that to a log file. This is because of the way the script `src/bin/sage` is written. We could change that:
