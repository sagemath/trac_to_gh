Currently, the Mac app only checks once whether people want to upgrade sagenb to Jupyter - and the default save location is atrocious.  From the author:

```
If it’s what I think you’re talking about, then yes it is Mac app specific.  It checks to see if there is a file at ~/.sage/sage_notebook.sagenb/users.pickle, and then asks if they want to "Upgrade", "Ask me Later", or "Don’task again".  It won’t ask again unless you choose "Ask me Later".  In particular, if you Upgrade then it won’t ask again (because presumably there is no need).  You can reset the check by running:

	defaults write org.sagemath.Sage askToUpgradeNB 1

The check itself is on line 511 of AppController.m in case you need to change anything.  I could easily add a menu option to upgrade, but I didn’t think it was worth it at the time.
```
Ideally we'd add a menu option as well.

Blocker because we will have a lot of people who only interact with this via the GUI who will be confused.

There are two commits.  The first unconditionally adds the menu item and the second greys it out if there are no files to be upgraded.  It's fine with me if you want to just use the first because you think it will be less confusing.

I should note that I didn't test the actual upgrade.

From [this sage-release thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/dZNnFGatC0M):

```
I used the occasion of SD86 to try out: 

        sage-8.0.beta0-OSX_10.11.6-x86_64.app.dmg 

on a participant's mac. I dragged and dropped the app from the dmg 
into Applications. I get an icon in the tray. However clicking the 
icon just starts the legacy notebook without reference to Jupyter. 

Running Jupyter from the command line works fine: 

        /Applications/Sagexxx/sage -notebook jupyter 

Did I miss something along the way? 
```
Should we then have a different message if there is nothing to upgrade when people want to launch Sage?  I believe the default is supposed to move to Jupyter at that point (Sage 8.0).  Volker, do I understand that correctly that we'd want the Mac app to default to Jupyter at that time?  So maybe we need a message asking  about this.

Also, Ivan, I think a message warning people on upgrade to choose a good folder to save their upgrades might be good.  I don't know how annoying that would be to implement.  I do like the greyed-out option idea.  Upgrades themselves work fine (or as fine as can be expected), I have tested this.

Oh!  I'll have to check that out - my sense was it was within the Sage app bundle directory but I may have just not been paying attention.

It doesn't work for me either, always starts sagenb.
* To run legacy SageNB: `sage --notebook=sagenb`
* To run Jupyter: `sage --notebook=jupyter`
* To run the SageNB -> Jupyter converter web app: `sage --notebook=export`

The menu points are
* Start SageNB Server
* Stop SageNB Server
* Start Jupyter        <-- does nothing?  Log is empty
* Stop Jupyter 
* Start SageNB Server  <-- again
* Stop SageNB Server   <-- again


Btw preferences -> Use alternate Sage executable is not saved (always unset after restart) and apparently never used

I pushed a fix to ensure that the Jupyter directory exists (which was why it wouldn't start).

However, Use Alternate Sage Executable has worked great for me for a long time.  Moreover, you should only see Start/Stop SageNB Server in the menu once.  One set should be hidden based on the setting of preferSageNB.   Volker, can you tell me more about what problems you are experiencing?

When I switch (still without this ticket) to not preferring old sagenb, I don't see gray out or hidden.   It does switch to the "lower" set of start/stop.

It still shows the possibility of starting either server.  My thought was that even if you prefer one, you should have the option of using the other.

It looks like the checkmark of "Stop Jupyter" was just set for some reason.  I wonder when I messed that up.  I have fixed it.

I changed the loading page to work for Jupyter too.  Hopefully, it's something like what you had in mind.

To test, just the mac app

```
open ./src/mac-app/Sage.xcodeproj/ # will open in Xcode
```
Then Command-R will build and run Sage.app (you'll have to set it to Use Alternate Sage Exectable in Preferences).  I think the only thing that doesn't work is the that Sage Version in About Sage isn't set (but who cares?).

I made Open Notebook into "open a currently running server or start the preferred," and hid New Worksheet unless they prefer SageNB.

Since I think we're getting close to something usable (if not there already) I rebased on develop and cleaned up the commits a little.  I hope that's not too onerous.

Most importantly, the upgrade is indeed now always accessible - by far the most important part.

So the only issue is that on *start only* it seems to always do legacy sagenb even if not checked to do so.  My guess is that there is still some default that went back to "yes" or something.

Yes, this works now.  I'll note that "New Worksheet" *always* appears in the File menu (as opposed to the menu item).  I don't know if that is intended, though.

Otherwise this should be merged and people should enjoy Sage 8.0!

It is amusing to unset the default Jupyter directory, close Sage, restart it, be asked to pick a directory (which is awesome), and then have the *sagenb* notebook start up ;-)

<a id='comment:26'>Comment 26:</a>
Ivan, is the problem here in `AppController.m`?

```
-(IBAction)openNotebook:(id)sender{
    if ( jupyterURL != nil ) {
        [self browseRemoteURL:jupyterURL];
    } else if ( port != 0 || (defaults && [defaults boolForKey:@"preferSageNB"]) ) {
        [self browseLocalSageURL:@""];
    } else {
        [self startJupyter:sender];
    }
}
```

Or conceivably in `start-sage.sh`

```
if [ "$NB_TYPE" = jupyter ]; then

./sage --notebook=jupyter $4 >> "$SAGE_LOG" 2>> "$SAGE_LOG" &

```
Maybe this hasn't actually been used properly?

I couldn't find any other place where this seems to be done. In particular 

```
   } else if ( port != 0 || (defaults && [defaults boolForKey:@"preferSageNB"]) ) {
```
maybe somehow `port` is set (I couldn't figure out how) accidentally when we start off?

Volker, truly this is otherwise ready to go, just FYI.
