The code for `cycle_index` predates permutation groups with arbitrary
domain, as well as their `cycle_type` methods. Instead it goes through
plain Permutation's, which only works if the domain is 1,...n:

```
sage: G = PermutationGroup([['b','c','a']], domain=['a','b','c'])
sage: G.cycle_index()
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
/opt/sage-git2/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/permutation.pyc in __init__(self, parent, l, check_input)
    519             for i in lst:
    520                 try:
--> 521                     i = int(i)
    522                 except TypeError:
    523                     raise ValueError("the elements must be integer variables")

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'
```

This ticket fixes that, and uses the occasion to clean a bit the code,
using in particular the `conjugacy_classes` method to avoid a direct
access to GAP, and the docstring.

This bug was discovered while updating the book "Calcul Mathématique avec Sage".
