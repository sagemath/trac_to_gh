Code like

```
cdef class X:
    meth = staticmethod(func)

def func(...):
    ...
```
is currently accepted by Cython but actually invalid since `func` should be defined *before* the line `meth = staticmethod(func)`.

When compiling with `binding=True` (#22747), code like the above breaks.

As another minor fix for #22747, we remove some redundant imports of `is_Polynomial`.
