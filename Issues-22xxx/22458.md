When running a local Jupyter notebook, the live documentation does not work at all. The notebook log reports

```
[...]
[W 12:55:00.384 NotebookApp] 403 POST /api/kernels (::1): '_xsrf' argument missing from POST
[W 12:55:00.385 NotebookApp] 403 POST /api/kernels (::1) 2.54ms referer=http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.html
```

One workaround, [suggested by Min R. K.](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/94#issuecomment-286408387) is to disable the XSRF security check in Jupyter.

This is meant as a temporary measure until Thebe will have been refactored on top of JupyterLab (tentatively a couple months???).

But of course if it's completely broken and nothing happens, that's not good.
