When running a local Jupyter notebook, the live documentation does not work at all. The notebook log reports

```
[...]
[W 12:55:00.384 NotebookApp] 403 POST /api/kernels (::1): '_xsrf' argument missing from POST
[W 12:55:00.385 NotebookApp] 403 POST /api/kernels (::1) 2.54ms referer=http://localhost:8888/kernelspecs/sagemath/doc/prep/Quickstarts/Interact.html
```

One workaround, [suggested by Min R. K.](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/94#issuecomment-286408387) is to disable the XSRF security check in Jupyter.

This is meant as a temporary measure until Thebe will have been refactored on top of JupyterLab (tentatively a couple months???).

It worries me a lot that Thebe upstream did not show any activity since May 2016 (for example, a trivial pull request from June 2016 was not merged). Is the project dead?

I am not much surprised: it's likely that, once JupyterLab is out, Thebe will become just a thin library on top of it. So I can see the lack of motivation for doing just light maintenance on it.
But of course if it's completely broken and nothing happens, that's not good.

Just saw this, you disabled XSRF protection on a potentially internet facing service that allows for arbitrary code execution. This needs to be fixed asap...
