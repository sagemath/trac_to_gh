This follows in from #22343 which is a dependency.  We implement Billerey's algorithm for finding the set of reducible primes for an elliptic curve without CM over a number field.  This is based on an implementation by Ciaran Schembri for a masters' project at Warwick.

I started putting Cremona's code for Billerey's algorithm into appropriate places in Sage.  I cleaned it up a bit and addes some documentations.  

Things left to do or fix:
* add documentation
* only works if the curve has integral discriminant
* incorporate into isogeny finding for EC's over number fields
* more examples, especially over larger fields
* timings against other methods
* probably more . . .

Please look at my commit, fixing some details about py3:

* using `r"""` for documentation containing latex operators

* do not use `.next`

If you agree with my changes, you can set to positive.. But I do not claim anything about checking the math, so you may want to wait for an expert's opinion.
