This follows in from #22343 which is a dependency.  We implement Billerey's algorithm for finding the set of reducible primes for an elliptic curve without CM over a number field.  This is based on an implementation by Ciaran Schembri for a masters' project at Warwick.

I started putting Cremona's code for Billerey's algorithm into appropriate places in Sage.  I cleaned it up a bit and addes some documentations.  

Things left to do or fix:
* add documentation
* only works if the curve has integral discriminant
* incorporate into isogeny finding for EC's over number fields
* more examples, especially over larger fields
* timings against other methods
* probably more . . .

The technical parts of Billerey I though were better kept separate and not as methods of the elliptic curve class itself, so I put them in gal_reps_number_field.py.

This leaves a much simplified method reducible_primes() in the elliptic curves class itself, while the isogeny class code uses the new function to find the reducible primes, with Billerey the default algorithm.

I could put in more examples if desired.  I have not done systematic timing tests, but note that until the work done on another ticket Larson's method could not handle fields of degree 5 and up at all.

While writing this I realised that I have not yet provided the possibility for E.isogeny_class() to use a non-default algorithm, and will add that, but I'll leave the ticket at "needs review" so that patchbots get working on it.

The last commit makes several improvements after more testing.  In Billerey's algorithm itself the improvement is to only use B. to find reducible primes greater than some lower bound (default 200) which never occur in practice, using the local test for smaller primes.  Secondly, after noticing that some "easy" examples were taking forever on account of class group computations (which in turn are triggered by the conversion to global minimal models) I added a minimal_models flag which defaults to True to give the old behaviour but which can be set to False.  New doctest to illustrate this are added.  This flag had to be put into dozens of places from the top-level E.isogeny_class() down through various layers to the underlying isogeny code.

I am currently checking that all the additional docstrings compile OK...

Please look at my commit, fixing some details about py3:

* using `r"""` for documentation containing latex operators

* do not use `.next`

If you agree with my changes, you can set to positive.. But I do not claim anything about checking the math, so you may want to wait for an expert's opinion.
