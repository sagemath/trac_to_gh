This follows in from #22343 which is a dependency.  We implement Billerey's algorithm for finding the set of reducible primes for an elliptic curve without CM over a number field.  This is based on an implementation by Ciaran Schembri for a masters' project at Warwick.

I started putting Cremona's code for Billerey's algorithm into appropriate places in Sage.  I cleaned it up a bit and addes some documentations.  

Things left to do or fix:
* add documentation
* only works if the curve has integral discriminant
* incorporate into isogeny finding for EC's over number fields
* more examples, especially over larger fields
* timings against other methods
* probably more . . .

This leaves a much simplified method reducible_primes() in the elliptic curves class itself, while the isogeny class code uses the new function to find the reducible primes, with Billerey the default algorithm.

I could put in more examples if desired.  I have not done systematic timing tests, but note that until the work done on another ticket Larson's method could not handle fields of degree 5 and up at all.

While writing this I realised that I have not yet provided the possibility for E.isogeny_class() to use a non-default algorithm, and will add that, but I'll leave the ticket at "needs review" so that patchbots get working on it.

Please look at my commit, fixing some details about py3:

* using `r"""` for documentation containing latex operators

* do not use `.next`

If you agree with my changes, you can set to positive.. But I do not claim anything about checking the math, so you may want to wait for an expert's opinion.
