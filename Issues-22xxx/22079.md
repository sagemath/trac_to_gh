```
The `ceil` function calls itself if 20000 bits of precision is not enough, which is an obvious infinite loop.

```
sage: ceil(SR(2^20000+1))
(no answer....)
```
and

```
sage: ceil(Infinity)
...
TypeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```
and

```
sage: ceil(NaN)
...
TypeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
```

One consequence is that conversion to `int` is also an infinite loop:

```
sage: int(SR(2^20000+1))
(no answer....)
```
and

```
sage: int(NaN)
...
TypeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in __instancecheck__
```

I propose a new implementation of `floor()` and `ceil()`. The basic idea is to remove the limit on the number of bits and instead put a limit on the number of attempts of computing the floor/ceil. In each attempt, the algorithm tries to determine *why* computing the floor/ceil did not work.

This fixes all issues that I know with the `floor()`/`ceil()` algorithm. Of course, the algorithm is still heuristic, so there will always be corner cases that won't work.

I just got hit by this again. Do you have any objections to just remove the "infinite loop" block from `ceil()` and `floor()`?

<a id='comment:29'></a>
About

```
if isinstance(x, (float, complex)):
    m = getattr(math, method)
    return Integer(m(x))
```
Two questions:

- with complex inputs, the `math` library gives an error

```
sage: 
sage: math.floor(0jr)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
sage: math.ceil(0jr)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
```
   hence there is a bit of contradiction here.

- why would you convert to an `Integer` and not just use the result of whatever `math.floor`, `math.ceil` is actually giving you. That would be more Python friendly. As an example the result of `cos` is not a Sage floating point

```
sage: cos(1.0r)
0.5403023058681398
sage: type(_)
<type 'float'>
```

Patchbot is green, the documentation looks good. The code is well documented and improves the present implementation. This all represents my minimum criterion to include code in Sage. There are a few things I'd ask you to change/add:
- there is one typo (`immediatly`)
- the ticket makes #12121 mostly a duplicate, and it would be nice if you could add the most relevant doctests from there, I'd suggest

```
sage: floor(log(4) / log(2))
2
sage: a = floor(5.4 + x); a
floor(x + 5.40000000000000)
sage: a.subs(x==2)
7
sage: floor(log(2**(3/2)) / log(2) + 1/2)
2
sage: floor(log(2**(-3/2)) / log(2) + 1/2)
-1
sage: e1 = pi - continued_fraction(pi).convergent(2785)
sage: e2 = e - continued_fraction(e).convergent(1500)
sage: f = e1/e2
sage: f = 1 / (f - continued_fraction(f).convergent(1000))
sage: f = f - continued_fraction(f).convergent(1)
sage: floor(f, bits=40000)
-1
sage: ceil(f, bits=40000)
0
```
You can set positive after the above changes. If you don't agree with my above criterion however then don't.

Finally for a later ticket, one doctest from #12121 cannot be solved. I agree not everything can be solved. This one however would be easy if you had some heuristic to call QQbar on algebraic expressions:

```
sage: z = (11/9*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 3)^(1/3) + 1/3/(11/9*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + 3)^(1/3) - 1
sage: ceil(z, bits=400000)
...fails
```
This is still better than current Sage so we should think of a way to limit or predict the effort QQbar is making, e.g. by predicting the degree of the minimal polynomial involved and calling QQbar from `floor()` when it does not take forever.
