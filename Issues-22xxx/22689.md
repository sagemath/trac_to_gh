there are quite a few places using
`#!/bin/bash` instead of 
`#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

Not every system will have the former available (e.g. FreeBSD does not).

These are the various instances of `/bin/bash` in the Sage sources:

1. To be fixed:

```
build/pkgs/gap3/patches/gap3_startup.patch: #!/bin/bash
build/pkgs/openblas/spkg-check:#!/bin/bash
build/pkgs/qepcad/sage-qepcad:#!/bin/bash
build/pkgs/r/spkg-check:#!/bin/bash
src/doc/en/installation/source.rst:         #!/bin/bash
```

2. OS-specific, so probably OK:

```
build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-install:    echo '#!/bin/bash' >>"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/ld"
src/bin/sage-rebase.sh:#! /bin/bash
src/mac-app/AppController.m:    [jupyterTask setLaunchPath:@"/bin/bash"];
src/mac-app/open-location.sh:#!/bin/bash
src/mac-app/sage-is-running-on-port.sh:#!/bin/bash
src/mac-app/start-sage.sh:#!/bin/bash
src/sage/ext/mac-app/README:#!/bin/bash
src/sage/ext/mac-app/README:#!/bin/bash
```

3. From a doctest marked `# random`, so not an issue:

```
src/sage/libs/cypari2/gen.pyx:            "/bin/bash"
```

I suppose stuff in `src/sage*/mac-app/` may be left intact, as it's OSX-specific.

There is none of these in `config/`. Have I missed any place where these `/bin/bash` can be, still? (Patching every spkg with this might be a bit too much though).
