Sorry, I thought I had tested the last version of the patch in #22633.  But I think I just tested it in PARI/GP, but not in Sage itself, since my Sage build was broken at the time for other reasons.

The offending line is [here](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/pkgs/pari/patches/prot_none_4.patch?h=develop&id=89e6ef4aea6f5af63a9ae40a998413dfc0bb39b5#n50).  It seems that `MAP_FIXED` is not working correctly for some reason, but the resulting call to `pari_err` segfaults because the pari mainstack is left in an invalid state.

I'm not sure if this is a bug in Cygwin or what, but I'm trying to put together a simplified test case.

> It seems that `MAP_FIXED` is not working correctly for some reason


The question now becomes: why?

Does everything work fine if you remove the line `if (res != addr) pari_err(e_MEM);`

For debugging, it would be useful to print the values of `addr`, `s` and `res` after that `mmap()` call.

With multi-threading, there is a non-zero chance of things going wrong.

For the record, calling `mmap()` with `MAP_FIXED` on a already-mapped region is specified by POSIX to replace an existing mapping. So if Cygwin does not support that, I would consider that a bug.

Define "worked". Did you run the PARI testsuite? And the Sage doctests in `src/sage/libs/*pari*`?

If both of these pass, then it's fine for me.
