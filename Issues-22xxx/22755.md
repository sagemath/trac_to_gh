Assorted fixes to lazy imports:

1. Drop support for `lazy_import(overwrite=False)` which was used only in one place in a dubious way to implement a 2-level lazy import (a lazy import being lazily imported).

2. More optimal code for binary operations like `__add__` by avoiding the `operator` module.

3. Move the code to replace a lazy import in a class namespace from `_get_object()` to `__get__`.

4. Partially inline `_get_object()` with a new `cdef inline` function for the case that the object has been initialized.

5. A lazy import without `at_startup` being imported at startup is now an error (it used to just print a message, which is less useful than an error traceback).

6. Implement [__matmul__](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/) (pointless in Python 2, but useful for Python 3).

7. Clean up the function `lazy_import` a bit.
