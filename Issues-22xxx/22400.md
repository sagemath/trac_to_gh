# Issue 22400: Transpose text databases of reflexive polytopes for PALP

We store reflexive polytopes in 2 and 3 dimensions as text files. The current version lists points as columns of matrices, but the default output for PALP is reversed and it gives cleaner code not handle two cases. The main point, however, is that it would be faster to construct reflexive polytopes lists in memory if files were written point by point.

The current code in Sage will accept both old and new versions of the database, while the new one I am (re)writing will work only with the new one.

There is also a comment in SPKG.txt (exactly five years old) that text files will be removed in favour of the also included binary ones. However this didn't happen yet and I think it makes sense to keep small lists in plain form which is so easy to parse directly in Python without relying on any database modules or PALP itself for that matter.
