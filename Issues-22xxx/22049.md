I'm not sure why this never came up for me before.  I did recently reinstall Cygwin, and maybe had forgotten that I long ago symlinked locale.h to xlocale.h.  Another possibility is that the version of Cygwin I was using didn't define strtold_l, which is the only case in which Numpy looks for xlocale.h.

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
