Apparently, Sage has an "interacts library" in `src/sage/interacts`. This should work in Jupyter too.

I think this ticket should be about making it work at all. Fixing bugs with the interact library can be done in follow-up tickets like #22644.

This is what I see with 7.6.rc2:

[This is the Trac macro *Image* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (before.png,95%))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#Image-macro)

This is what I see with 7.6.rc2 + #22636:

[This is the Trac macro *Image* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (after.png,90%))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#Image-macro)

Therefore, I can not conclude that the actual description of this ticket is achieved, i.e., that interact library "work in Jupyter". Or maybe this ticket's goal is something else like getting to an intermediate state before #22644?

What is the goal of this ticket? Does the above picture shows that this goal is achieved?

It works for me (an actual interact is displayed), see [attachment:interacts.png](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket22636/interacts.png).

Could you please double-check that you properly built Sage (i.e. `make` or `make build` worked without errors)?
