Currently, only one of the two is allowed.
For at least some backends (certainly, the generic (`"field"`) backend and polymake (#22683)), it makes sense to initialize with both if they are known, to avoid expensive recomputation.  (This could also be the basis of code that delegates to a particular backend for particular features.)
Users should also be allowed to indicate whether the given presentations are already minimal.

In this ticket, we implement this for `Polyhedron_field`, enabling fast `base_extend`.

When both V-rep and H-rep are given, they must be minimal; the interface is designed to allow for future extensions.

The top-level constructor `Polyhedron` is unchanged in this ticket. It is still an error if `Polyhedron(vertices=..., inequalities=...)` is attempted. 

Without this ticket:

```
sage: p = polytopes.hypercube(6, backend='ppl')
sage: %time q = p.base_extend(AA)
CPU times: user 2.27 s, sys: 10.3 ms, total: 2.28 s
Wall time: 2.28 s
sage: q
A 6-dimensional polyhedron in AA^6 defined as the convex hull of 64 vertices
```

With this ticket:

```
CPU times: user 13.4 ms, sys: 603 µs, total: 14 ms
Wall time: 14.9 ms
```

One good way to do things lazily is use the ``@`lazy_attribute`. It also works well when setting `self._foo = x`.

```

sage: F.test = 5
sage: F.test
5
sage: B = Foo()
sage: B.test  # This will take a while

+Currently, only one of the two is allowed.
+For at least some backends (certainly, the generic (`"field"`) backend and polymake (#22683)), it makes sense to initialize with both if they are known, to avoid expensive recomputation.  (This could also be the basis of code that delegates to a particular backend for particular features.)
+Users should also be allowed to indicate whether the given presentations are already minimal.
 
+In this ticket, we implement this for `Polyhedron_field`, enabling fast `base_extend`.
+
+When both V-rep and H-rep are given, they must be minimal; the interface is designed to allow for future extensions.
+
+The top-level constructor `Polyhedron` is unchanged in this ticket. It is still an error if `Polyhedron(vertices=..., inequalities=...)` is attempted.

+Without this ticket:
