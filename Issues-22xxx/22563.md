The following is a bug:

```
sage: S1 = Manifold(1, 'S^1') # the circle
sage: U = S1.open_subset('U') # the complement of one point
sage: Xt.<t> =  U.chart('t:(0,2*pi)') # the standard angle coordinate
sage: V = S1.open_subset('V') # the complement of the point t=pi
sage: Xu.<u> = V.chart('u:(0,2*pi)') # the angle t-pi
sage: S1.declare_union(U, V)
sage: e = S1.vector_frame('e') # a global vector frame (makes S^1 parallelizable)
sage: R2 = Manifold(2, 'R^2', start_index=1) # Euclidean space R^2
sage: X2.<x,y> = R2.chart() # Cartesian coordinates
sage: F = S1.diff_map(R2, {(Xt,X2): [cos(t), sin(t)],
....:                      (Xu,X2): [-cos(u), -sin(u)]}) # embedding S^1 --> R^2
sage: dx = X2.coframe()[1] # the 1-form dx on R^2
sage: a = F.pullback(dx) ; a
1-form on the 1-dimensional differentiable manifold S^1
sage: a._components
{Coordinate frame (V, (d/du)): 1-index components w.r.t. Coordinate frame (V, (d/du)),
 Coordinate frame (U, (d/dt)): 1-index components w.r.t. Coordinate frame (U, (d/dt))}
```
As a tensor field on `S^1`, `a` should have components only on frames which domain is `S^1` and not some strict subsets of it, like `U` and `V`. Only restrictions of `a` to `U` and `V` (as stored in `a._restrictions`) shall be initialized in the current case.

This ticket fixes the issue. It also changes the names of the pullback helper function and its arguments for a better readability. It also corrects some typos in the error messages in methods of `DiffMap`.

If `_pullback_chart` is suppose to be a method, then the first argument should be `self` to keep with Python conventions. However, if it is better served as a function, then I think we should make it into a proper function.

Giving a second thought to this, I think I see what you mean: we should consider the nested function `_pulback_chart` as a method, setting the name of its first argument to `self`, even if this `self` is not the `self` of the enclosing method `pull_back` (but actually a restriction of it). Correct?

Also, this is a further tangent so feel free to ignore (for this ticket), but because `jacob` is a matrix (at least I think it is), it is (much) faster to do:

```diff
+jacob[ind_old[i]-si2,ind_new[i]-si1]
-jacob[ind_old[i]-si2][ind_new[i]-si1]
```
because it doesn't have to create the intermediate `vector` object.

OK; I've reverted to the first arg being `diff_map` in the above commit.

> However, it does not seem to be using anything in the containing method, so I don't see why it should be nested? 

Well, I made it nested because the only use case of this function is within the method `pullback` and I did not want to pollute the TAB completion of `DiffMap` objects.

Thanks for pointing this! I've taken the opportunity of the above commit to correct it.
