# Issue 22731: Replace "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin" by more specific variables to make Sage easier to package, use in venvs

Various scripts refer to "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin" in a way that conflates several different uses. We introduce new variables to give packagers more flexibility without having to patch, and to enable new installation schemes, including the use of Sage in users' venvs.

**1a.** Introduce `$SAGE_BIN` as the place where the binaries of all the SPKGs get installed to. Default is `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`.

**1b.** (Wishlist item:) Make it configurable through `./configure --bindir`, but this would need major changes to spkg-configure scripts. (Supporting `--bindir` would be another step toward more autotools compliance, see Meta-ticket #21566.) 

**2a.** Scripts such as `src/bin/sage`, `src/bin/sage-eval` are installed by the `sagelib` package using the `scripts` facility of distutils/setuptools.  If `sagelib` is installed into a venv, these scripts are installed into the `bin` directory of the venv. For the default installation in sage-the-distribution `--with-system-python`, this venv is identical with `SAGE_LOCAL`.  But if other venvs are created by the user, it will be unrelated to `SAGE_LOCAL`; in fact, `SAGE_LOCAL` may be undefined (in distribution packaging and when installing sagelib through pip). As proposed in #29013, we use the variable `SAGE_VENV` for this, so these scripts would be referred to as `$SAGE_VENV/bin/sage-eval` etc.

**2b.** Referring to the `python3` used for sage. Likewise, this comes from the venv, not `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  So it should be referred to as `$SAGE_VENV/bin/python3`.

**2c.** The subset of the scripts in `src/bin`, currently installed by the `sagelib` package, that are "libexec"-like (not user-facing). Distribution packagers would like to hide these scripts.  (In the old description of this ticket, it was proposed to use `$SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` for this, but a more specific name is needed: We will use `$SAGE_VENV_SCRIPTS_DIR`.)

**In this ticket,** we introduce `SAGE_VENV` for 2abc, ignoring the "libexec" aspect (using `$SAGE_VENV/bin` directly instead of going through `SAGE_VENV_SCRIPTS_DIR`).  Items 1 and the libexec aspect of 2c  can be done on follow-up tickets.

We also make `sage-env-config` optional from the viewpoint of the other scripts. This is preparation for #29850 / #29852.

The name `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` refers to the scripts of Sage itself. It is only meant to find `sage-env` and friends, nothing more.

Now, if you want a invent a *new* variable with the purpose of defining the bindir (to replace `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`), that's fine. Just don't call it `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR`.

Would people on this thread have an idea on what can be done to make `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` work when `$SAGE_ROOT` is not yet set and/or how one can figure out if `$SAGE_ROOT/sage` (a script that has more logic to figure out a value for `$SAGE_ROOT`) is an acceptable executable to use?

It comes up in producing a jupyter kernelspec for sage that is suitable for use by an external jupyter. See: 
[sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/yEUJOW2fnJI)

If we can make it very easy to install sage's kernelspec in arbitrary jupyter configurations, it becomes significantly easier to integrate sage in computational environments (for instance, should the nteract desktop jupyter client ever become popular, we could just provide easy interfacing with a system install of it rather than packaging it with sage).

Configurable through `./configure --bindir`, default `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`.\n-* Make `$SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` available like any other `$SAGE_\u2026` variable everywhere and use it as the directory where all the `sage-*` scripts are installed to. The default should be `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`, however, it's configurable as `./configure --with-scriptsdir`.\n+Various scripts refer to \"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin\" in a way that conflates several different uses. We introduce new variables to give packagers more flexibility without having to patch, and to enable new installation schemes.\n \n-CI runs for the proposed changes [This is the Trac macro *Image* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac/badges/u/saraedum/22731/pipeline.svg,link=https://gitlab.com/sagemath/dev/trac/commits/u/saraedum/22731))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#Image-macro) (note that the patchbot does not test these changes.)\n+* Introduce `$SAGE_BIN` as the place where the binaries of all the SPKGs get installed to. Default is `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`.\n+\n+  - Wishlist item: Make it configurable through `./configure --bindir`, but this would need major changes to spkg-configure scripts. (Supporting `--bindir` would be another step toward more autotools compliance, see Meta-ticket #21566.) \n+\n+* Scripts such as `src/bin/sage`, `src/bin/sage-eval` are installed by the `sagelib` package using the `scripts` facility of distutils/setuptools.  If `sagelib` is installed into a venv, these scripts are installed into the `bin` directory of the venv. For the default installation in sage-the-distribution `--with-system-python`, this venv is identical with `SAGE_LOCAL`.

-* Introduce `$SAGE_BIN` as the place where sage and the binaries of all the SPKGs get installed to. Configurable through `./configure --bindir`, default `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`.
-* Make `$SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` available like any other `$SAGE_…` variable everywhere and use it as the directory where all the `sage-*` scripts are installed to. The default should be `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`, however, it's configurable as `./configure --with-scriptsdir`.

Codewise this looks good to me, but may I ask that you add a shortened version of the ticket description as comments in the `env.py` file as documentation for the `SAGE_VENV` and `SAGE_LOCAL` variable as it's not clear from the context when to use which.

Moreover, I was wondering if it makes sense to provide only a variable `SAGE_VENV_BIN` pointing to the binary folder in the venv (since at least from your ticket description and code changes would be sufficient and parallels the upcoming `SAGE_BIN`).

Needs another review as I'm not yet that familiar with sages inner workings.

I see how it is used now. And no, `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` or anything like that is not known, we are bootstrapping the documentation, which you should be able to do before running configure.

Some dummy values could be set in the bootstrap script on the assumption you do that on a clean tree.
