```
assume(x>-1)
assume(x<1)
arcsin(x)+arccos(x)
```
should, in principle, over the reals, simplify to pi/2 on the interval -1 to 1.  I'm sure numerous problems would result with branches and step functions and whatnot if one actually attempted to implement this ... but in a wishlist world, one can dream!

not sure if this makes dreams come true, but just in case:

```
sage: giac('assume(x>-1 and x<1)')
x
sage: giac('simplify(acos(x)+asin(x))')
1/2*pi
```

Ha, nice!  This can definitely be part of the solution given that giac is apparently now going to be standard?
