[Somehow downloads as `SuiteSparse-5.6.0.tar.gz` in chromium]
Since cvxopt 1.1.9, [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
is no longer included, thus it will have to be packaged separately.

Ticket #19687 was our previous upgrade, to cvxopt 1.1.8 (released 2015-09-22).

I don't know about debian and other but we split `suitesparse` in components in Gentoo. I would be shocked if the other didn't do the same. It looks like upstream integrated a lot of the autoconfig patches that were floating around which makes life easier.
What cvxopt needs:
* suitesparseconfig
   *amd
     *umfpack
  *colamd
     *cholmod

Indentation is for dependency. That's without optional or more complicated configuration - a minimal setup (although options using blas/lapack could be enabled without extra burden). All the above in mimimum configuration is LGPL 2.1. In non-mimimum configuration some switch to GPL-2.

From `setup.py` - this can all be overridden, but it horrifies me

```
# Guess SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR and SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR
if platform.platform().startswith("Darwin"):
    # macOS
    SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR = '/usr/local/lib'
    SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR = '/usr/local/include'
else: 
    # default: Ubuntu/Debian
    SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR = "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
    SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR = "/usr/include/suitesparse"
```
The only line that is valid is the default include directory for debian. The rest is accessible by default without defining anything.

Well we are a bit old school but the instructions of the README at https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo are still working. One day I'll update them to something a little bit more modern. Note that you also need the science overlay. I won't finish sage 8.4 tongiht I am afraid. Too much to do, it will be ready in 12 hours.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A7):

> Well we are a bit old school but the instructions of the README at https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo are still working. 

A somewhat cryptic error:

```
!!! The ebuild selected to satisfy "sage" has unmet requirements.
- sci-mathematics/sage-8.4::sage-on-gentoo USE="X doc-html-bin -bliss -debug -doc-html -doc-pdf -doc-pdf-bin -jmol -latex -modular_decomposition -sagenb -testsuite" ABI_X86="(64)" L10N="-ca -de -en -es -fr -hu -it -ja -pt -ru -tr" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_6"

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    doc-html-bin? ( l10n_en )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    doc-html? ( l10n_en sagenb ) doc-pdf? ( sagenb ) testsuite? ( any-of ( doc-html doc-html-bin ) ) doc-html-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) doc-pdf-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) any-of ( python_targets_python2_7 python_targets_python3_6 )
```

no idea what's wrong. Changing `doc-html-bin` to `-doc-html-bin` allows the build to go forward.

I am going to make an attempt at a "reduced" suitesparse spkg. Reduced because I will not make default packages (which aren't used by anything else) that use cmake. Note that suitesparse will move to cmake for the whole thing in the near future.

The fun bit is that suitesparse is effectively a small mini distribution itself (but most of the upstreams are now totally absorbed by the project). It doesn't currently work very nicely with building phases unless we break down the various components.

I didn't know the Cygwin buildbot was even working.  Last I checked on it it was having problems with hanging on the doc build.  I meant to look into it before vacation and then it just slipped off my radar.  I'll look into it though.
