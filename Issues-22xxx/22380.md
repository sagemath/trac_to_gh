Since cvxopt 1.1.9, [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
is no longer included, thus it will have to be packaged separately.

Ticket #19687 was our previous upgrade, to cvxopt 1.1.8 (released 2015-09-22).

I don't know about debian and other but we split `suitesparse` in components in Gentoo. I would be shocked if the other didn't do the same. It looks like upstream integrated a lot of the autoconfig patches that were floating around which makes life easier.
What cvxopt needs:
* suitesparseconfig
   *amd
     *umfpack
  *colamd
     *cholmod

Indentation is for dependency. That's without optional or more complicated configuration - a minimal setup (although options using blas/lapack could be enabled without extra burden). All the above in mimimum configuration is LGPL 2.1. In non-mimimum configuration some switch to GPL-2.

For starters I should get sage-on-gentoo running on my Gentoo laptop.

> Well we are a bit old school but the instructions of the README at https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo are still working. 


A somewhat cryptic error:

```
!!! The ebuild selected to satisfy "sage" has unmet requirements.
- sci-mathematics/sage-8.4::sage-on-gentoo USE="X doc-html-bin -bliss -debug -doc-html -doc-pdf -doc-pdf-bin -jmol -latex -modular_decomposition -sagenb -testsuite" ABI_X86="(64)" L10N="-ca -de -en -es -fr -hu -it -ja -pt -ru -tr" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_6"

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    doc-html-bin? ( l10n_en )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    doc-html? ( l10n_en sagenb ) doc-pdf? ( sagenb ) testsuite? ( any-of ( doc-html doc-html-bin ) ) doc-html-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) doc-pdf-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) any-of ( python_targets_python2_7 python_targets_python3_6 )
```

no idea what's wrong. Changing `doc-html-bin` to `-doc-html-bin` allows the build to go forward.

I'm getting an `Invalid checksum` error for `cvxopt-1.2.2.tar.gz`.

> Yes it is unusual. And very strange. There is some control for openmp in the main makefile I think so it has to be turned off there (or autodetected properly there). But not finding stuff in `/usr/local/lib` is highly unusual - and it appears this is not your compiler's fault but ld's fault. Is it GNU ld, some kind of BSD ld or llvm's ld?



```
$ ld -v
LLD 6.0.1 (FreeBSD 335540-1200005) (compatible with GNU linkers)
```

yep. If it is called directly, it does not know where to look for libraries, so one much pass 
`-L/lib -L/usr/lib -L` etc to it.

Definitely not called directly (I checked) the compiler is called to do the linking so `-fopenmp` should set all the flags properly. I am calling that a bug in linking driver of the compiler.

Basic bump to latest versions without any splitting of suitesparse. In the event of a split with need the following components
* suitesparseconfig

The order is indicative or the compilation order [OK amd and colamd do not depend on each other].

This doesn't include a new `spkg-check`. I want to defer that to a positive review of this part on cygwin at least.
