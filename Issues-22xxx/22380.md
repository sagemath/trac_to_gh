Since cvxopt 1.1.9, [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
is no longer included, thus it will have to be packaged separately.

Ticket #19687 was our previous upgrade, to cvxopt 1.1.8 (released 2015-09-22).

What cvxopt needs:
* suitesparseconfig
   *amd
     *umfpack
  *colamd
     *cholmod

Indentation is for dependency. That's without optional or more complicated configuration - a minimal setup (although options using blas/lapack could be enabled without extra burden). All the above in mimimum configuration is LGPL 2.1. In non-mimimum configuration some switch to GPL-2.

  The following REQUIRED_USE flag constraints are unsatisfied:
    doc-html-bin? ( l10n_en )

  The above constraints are a subset of the following complete expression:
    doc-html? ( l10n_en sagenb ) doc-pdf? ( sagenb ) testsuite? ( any-of ( doc-html doc-html-bin ) ) doc-html-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) doc-pdf-bin? ( !doc-html !doc-pdf l10n_en ) any-of ( python_targets_python2_7 python_targets_python3_6 )
```

no idea what's wrong. Changing `doc-html-bin` to `-doc-html-bin` allows the build to go forward.

Checking components would be needed anyway, as it's installed as a bunch of separate libraries, whether they come from one blob or many.
