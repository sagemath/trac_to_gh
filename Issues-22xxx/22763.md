```
In a fresh Sage, assumptions on symbols within expressions are preserved when Maxima returns the same expression in an unevaluated integral. But in this case the domain/flag information of `m` is somehow cleared/deleted:

```
sage: _ = var('m')
sage: (x^m / sqrt(2+3*x)).integral(x)
integrate(x^m/sqrt(3*x + 2), x)
sage: _= var('m', domain='integer')
sage: (x^m / sqrt(2+3*x)).integral(x)
integrate(x^m/sqrt(3*x + 2), x)
sage: _.operands()[0].operands()[1]
x^m
sage: _.operands()[1].is_integer()
False
```
`assume(m, 'integer')` cannot restore the flag of `m` in the returned integral.

The problem does not occur without the first two lines.  Maybe the first creation of `m` does somehow irrevocably set something in Maxima (or Sage's module for backtranslation)?
