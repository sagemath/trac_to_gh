Currently quotient rings are not unique parents which sometimes causes trouble with 

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: R.quo(x) is R.quo(x)
False
sage: R.quo(x) == R.quo(x)
True
```

The changes proposed here make the creation go through a factory which makes sure that the parents are unique.

Keywords: sd86.5, sd87

I agree. However, this is already happening automagically: `quo` creates a (principal) ideal and takes its generator as the modulus which is the same `x+1` in both of your examples.
At the same time, if someone insists to create a quotient with the modulus `x + 1` and one with the modulus `2*x + 2` by calling `PolynomialQuotientRing` directly, then these should be distinct because `.modulus()` is going to have a different value for the two, i.e., they are distinguishable.
