This patch adds a certificate of non-distributivity.

Test code:

```
for i in range(100):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(20, 0.99)
    if not L.is_distributive():
        x,y,z = L.is_distributive(certificate=True)[1]
        if L.meet(x, L.join(y, z)) == L.join(L.meet(x,y),L.meet(x,z)):
            L.show()
            break
else:
    print("OK")
```
