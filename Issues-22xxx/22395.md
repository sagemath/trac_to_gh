The following (although correct) is not ideal:

```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('ZZ^n * n^ZZ', ZZ)
sage: (-1)^n/n + O((-1)^n/n^2) + n + O(1/n^3) + O(1/n^(2+I))
(-1)^n*n^(-1) + O((-1)^n*n^(-2)) + n + O(n^(-I - 2))
```
The O-Terms could/should be combined. The O-Term `O((-1)<sup>n*n</sup>(-2))` should be `O(n^-2)` and `O(n^(-I - 2))` should be `O(n^-2)`.

The ordering is also not what one would expect, e.g.

```
sage: (-1)^n/n + O((-1)^n/n^2) + n^2 + O(1/n^3) + O(1/n^(2+I))
(-1)^n*n^(-1) + O((-1)^n*n^(-2)) + n^2 + O(n^(-I - 2))
```
and we would like to see the `n^2` at the front.

Here I am not sure, if this is the same problem as above; if not, then we can either forget about it or open a new ticket for it.
