This is caused by definition of macros for `toupper` and other functions in `pyport.h` specifically on OS X. This is unsafe with C++ and the issue has been known in MacPort for years: https://trac.macports.org/ticket/44288. 

We should adopt their patch for python.

I note that the upstream python issue http://bugs.python.org/issue10910 is marked closed while there was never really a good solution in my opinion.
Anyone can do something about this issue? Can it be re-opened, or do we need a new one.

Depends what's in `pyport.h`, I cannot see any commit being linked to issue 10910. I can have a look at #22037 which would then be a preferred option to this ticket, but I am running out of time.
