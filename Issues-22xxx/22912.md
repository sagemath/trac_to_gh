The method `is_tree` is currently not working properly for graphs with loops. In particular, when asking for a certificate, the method may end without returning anything.

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,0), (0,1)], loops=True)
sage: G.is_tree()
False
sage: G.is_tree(certificate=True)
```

I'm not sure of the best way to fix it. 
1. consider that a graph has a loop it is not a tree. It suffices to add a special case, and possibly return a loop as a certificate.
2. ignore loops. Certainly more complicated to implement.

As said below, we choose option 1.

I would never ignore loops as it would make `G` into a tree. So the only option is 1, where we return the loop as the certificate.
