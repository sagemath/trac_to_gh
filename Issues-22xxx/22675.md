I'm not sure but this might also fix #22635 if that gets incorporated into the final release.

The fix to #22633 is still held up for some reason, even though it has nothing directly to do with the concerns about emscripten.

#22633 will certainly not be fixed in 2.9.2 because my `PROT_NONE` patches are not in 2.9.2 either.

`prot_none_4.patch` included with commit `343f241` is part of the branch.

Of course not. But you can care about the future of your patches and ask to have it backported in stable releases.
