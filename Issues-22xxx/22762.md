I think we should add the `@total_ordering` as this change in effect removes functionality while we are using Python2. Otherwise we should go full bore the other direction and remove `__lt__`.

For example, with this branch:

```
sage: P = BinaryQF([2,2,3])
sage: Q = BinaryQF([1,2,3])
sage: Q <= P
False
```
If this is done for print sorting (the ordering seems artificial to me), then I think those places should have other sorting methods. Is there a specific place where this sorting is used?
