As reported on sage-support, sometimes the integral_points() method for elliptic curves over Q misses solutions because of a precision problem in the final stage.  This can be fixed with a minor change which will be posted to this ticket.

Note that there is a larger related ticket #10973 which will fix other integral points issues.  This ticket should *not* wait until that one is finished.

Sorry about that.  Clearly it has been a while since I did this...I have uploaded a new version, but have not yet rebuilt the docs as I had to do "make doc-clean".

And the patchbot will build the doc for you, and check some points, including this one.

looks good.

note that you can shorten `all([something(x) for x in y])`
by writing `all(something(x) for x in y)`

apart from that, I can set a positive review if you want.

checking the patch, for the following curve

```
misses the point 

```
(361833546632,217652291371861061).
```

Same for n=71,74 again one point is missing, 
But for n=91, two points are missing 

```
(299128 : 163600867 : 1),(2271477041288 : 3423438475922164973:1)
```

If we take prec=150, then we shall find all the points (in the previous examples).
Maybe it is better to set as default prec , say 200, instead of 100, to the function
*integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coeffs(E, mw_base, N, prec=100).*
Setting a constant prec, is very likely not to cover all the cases. For instance, 
the curve 

```
n=1400,E1=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-2,n^2])
```
needs prec=220 to find all the points.

Maybe it is a good idea to pass the prec also in the original function
*integral_points().*

A *weird example* is the following,

```
n=201
E1=EllipticCurve([0,0,0,-2,n^2]);E1;
S=E1.integral_points(verbose=True);S;4*n^6-4*n^2
```
provides

```
Using mw_basis  [(0 : 201 : 1), (-5286719/1134225 :

x-coords of extra integral points:

```
I used the following code to check the relation with the precision,

```
def int_points(E,N,prec):
    from sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.ell_rational_field import integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coeffs
    mw_base = E.gens()
    I = integral_points_with_bounded_mw_coeffs(E, mw_base, N, prec=prec)
    I=list(I)
    for i in range(len(I)):
        print E.lift_x(I[i])
```


```
sage:int_points(E1,2,200)
(0 : 201 : 1)
sage:int_points(E1,3,100)
(263776642243200 : 4284049728241222722999 : 1)
(0 : 201 : 1)
```
Seems that, this is not a precision problem but the bound N does not take the right value 3.

ok, the patch indeed fixes the problems with precision. 
The last example n=201, does not belong in this specific case.
Also, I found the following curves 

```
y^2=x^3+2*x+n^2, for n\in{190,204,208,215,224},
```
 that this last patch fails to find all the integer points. But as you already point out this concerns the ticket 10973. So I think, at least the original problem (concerning precision) was fixed.

Back to positive review!
