I agree that complex embeddings should go to `QQbar` or something like that by default, but for me this is a separate issue, already tracked elsewhere.

However, having the `K[α]` syntax create the “standard” embedding makes more sense to me (less confusing, probably breaks fewer existing things) than having it attempt to embed the number field in `α`'s parent or something like that—if that's what you have in mind.
