OK, so `spkg-install` ran ok but no `spkg-check` is failing. For exactly the same reason and I should say at exactly the same point. This is because we already run the test suite of openblas in `spkg-install` as it seems to be part of the default target. And we have a failure in `spkg-check` because `make` was not run with the same arguments as in `spkg-install` - notably `USE_THREAD=0`. There are three things we could do at this stage:

Other notes: this output means that the last patch I didn't forward upstream is what is needed to fix the build in #22021. A problem with `ifdef`, I cannot really forward that patch upstream without knowing precisely what shell was making it fail.

The main makefile has 

```
all :: libs netlib tests shared
```
so I am guessing we could call make on `libs netlib shared`. I'll put something together to try.
