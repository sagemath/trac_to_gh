Checksums for tarballs should **never** change! If you find a bug, you release a *new* tarball instead of changing an existing tarball.

Also, it makes no sense to put the tarball in the git repo.

Please read https://packaging.python.org/ for how to create a proper source tarball for Python projects and put it on PyPI.
