The proposed experimental sage_guess package is designed to guess formulas for input sequences. The package puts wrappers around existing sequence recognition packages available in Sage, including the [fricas guess package](http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/GuessingFormulasForSequences), the [oeis function](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/oeis.html), and existing routines for guessing rational generating functions for input sequences. The package also includes a new implementation of a factorization-based procedure used to determine factors of special sequences that are otherwise difficult to process with existing software routines available in Sage. In coding the package, I tried to incorporate the suggestions from my [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/FfJrjaSdkF8).

A [wiki](https://github.com/maxieds/sage-guess/wiki) containing documentation on how to install the Python source to the package without the Sage package and more importantly several examples of the current capability of the package is available.

Checksums for tarballs should **never** change! If you find a bug, you release a *new* tarball instead of changing an existing tarball.

Also, it makes no sense to put the tarball in the git repo.

Please read https://packaging.python.org/ for how to create a proper source tarball for Python projects and put it on PyPI.
