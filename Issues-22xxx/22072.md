The proposed experimental sage_guess package is designed to guess formulas for input sequences. The package puts wrappers around existing sequence recognition packages available in Sage, including the [fricas guess package](http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/GuessingFormulasForSequences), the [oeis function](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/sage/databases/oeis.html), and existing routines for guessing rational generating functions for input sequences. The package also includes a new implementation of a factorization-based procedure used to determine factors of special sequences that are otherwise difficult to process with existing software routines available in Sage. In coding the package, I tried to incorporate the suggestions from my [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/FfJrjaSdkF8).

A [wiki](https://github.com/maxieds/sage-guess/wiki) containing documentation on how to install the Python source to the package without the Sage package and more importantly several examples of the current capability of the package is available. A link to the associated source tarball for the package is given [here](https://github.com/maxieds/sage-guess/blob/master/sage_guess-1.0.0.tar.gz).

Also, it makes no sense to put the tarball in the git repo.
