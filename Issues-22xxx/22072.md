CC:  @vbraun

This gives drastic improvement for small polytopes which is the target case. Before:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices())")
25 loops, best of 3: 35.2 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices())")
625 loops, best of 3: 684 Âµs per loop
```
Next in the chain of lattice polytope improvements is #22310

Volker, I was going to stop bugging you, but this great speed up is mostly due to what you've done for cones, I've just adjusted it to work with points rather than rays.

For multiline imports, you can use (IMO cleaner):

```
from sage.libs.ppl import (C_Polyhedron, Generator_System, Linear_Expression,
                           point as PPL_point)
```
Otherwise LGTM.
