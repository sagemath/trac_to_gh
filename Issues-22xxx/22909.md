Provide a keyword argument to construct a tuple of symbolic variables:

```
sage: SR.var('x', 4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

This change is backwards incompatible with `var('x','y')`, where the second argument is treated as the latex name. We should also handle the latex name too.

The argument name of `index` is misleading. Perhaps `n`, `index_set`, `indicies`, or `number`?

Little thing, but the error messages should start with a lowercase letter (at least all new messages).

as usual, thanks for your prompt feedback!!

> This change is backwards incompatible with `var('x','y')`, where the second argument is treated as the latex name. We should also handle the latex name too.

yes. with the current commit one has:

```
sage: SR.var('x', 'y')
...
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'is_integer'
```

instead of:

```
sage: SR.var('x', latex_name='y')
x
sage: latex(x)
{y}
```

should i do this with some type checking to handle (integer/string), or just ordering the arguments in a different way and expect user to always type `index=...`? 

IMO, it is better if `SR.var('x', 4)` is understood by the program.

i used `index` because one speaks of "indexed variables". for those you suggest let me upvote (in order of preference): `n` and `indices`. in addition to those, let me add as options: `len`, `length` or `size`. what do others think?

>

ok, and full stop yes or no? 

the question is if an exception should be a complete sentence or not.

I agree. It just means some more complicated code to parse the inputs, but it has better useability.

I think `n` is generic but clear enough for something like this. I don't have too much of a preference (but not `index`).

They are generally not, at least by Python's standard. So no full stop nor uppercase letter.
