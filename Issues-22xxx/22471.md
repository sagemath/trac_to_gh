I have always found it hard to understand the `new_ref` mechanism of `Gen` and what the related attributes `b` and `refers_to` mean. I propose:

1. Rename `b` to `chunck`.

2. Split `refers_to` in two because it is used in two independent ways: instead add `parent` and `itemcache` attributes.

3. Turn `new_ref` into a method of `Gen`.

4. Document this a lot better.

No, no. The argument on `new_ref` being used by power series is a good one. I hadn't read the diff that far.

The Py3 failure must be dealt with, however.

<a id='comment:13'></a>About the py3 failure:

This is OK since Cython understands `xrange`:

```
            inds = xrange(*n.indices(l))
```

This comes from the dependency which is merged now (there is no `cmp` in the current diff):

```
            sage: cmp(pari('2/3'), pari('2/5'))
```

So there is nothing to be done here...

Mmm... right. But is it going to support it in the long run? I cannot find much info on what Cython plans are. What's the most future proof way of using iterators in Cython?
