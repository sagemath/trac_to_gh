<a id='comment:5'></a>Now a correct example. It is done with

```
L = Posets.BooleanLattice(3)
L = L.day_doubling([1,3])

def double_no_check(self, S):
    S_ = [self._element_to_vertex(e) for e in S]

    g = self.hasse_diagram()
    g.relabel(lambda e: (e, 0))

    for e in S:
        g.add_edge((e, 0), (e, 1))
        for e_up in self.upper_covers(e):
            if e_up in S:
                g.add_edge((e, 1), (e_up, 1))
            else:
                g.delete_edge((e, 0), (e_up, 0))
                g.add_edge((e, 1), (e_up, 0))

    return LatticePoset(g)

L = double_no_check(L, [(3, 1), (6, 0), (2, 0), (5, 0), (1, 1), (4, 0)])
```

where `(3, 0)` shows that the subset to double is not convex.

I may be that there is no smaller example of a lattice costructible by doublings of some subset but not constructible by doublings of convex subset.
