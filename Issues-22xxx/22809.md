```
The number of generators of a polynomial can be specified as a number:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 4).gens()
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

This ticket should allow doing: 

```
sage: polygens(QQ, 'x', 4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

Currently it returns `TypeError: polygens() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)`.

great idea! it is very useful that these variables 'exist' in the calling method.
as you can see in revised patch i used `get_main_globals` to get around the issue.

how does it look? does someone suggest other examples?

ok, thanks for pointing that out! although it seems to me that #11576 is an advanced version of the simpler (but yet lacking) uses `var('x', 4)` and `var('x', 4, 4)` for vectors and matrices respectively. or i'm missing some basic reason why they don't exist already?

Don't both return a result and inject bindings (and certainly don't go grabbing the global scope!). It's pretty clear that the behaviour of `var` to both inject and return variables is a mistake once you see the confusion it causes.

Injection of polynomial variables is quite efficiently done with `PolynomialRing(R,'x',4).inject_variables()`, which prints a message and returns `None` on purpose.

`polygen(*args)` is just a short form of `PolynomialRing(*args).gens()` which helps people who know what a polynomial variable is but not what a polynomial ring is. I think it's a bad design decision to muddle this with other features.

I'm also against providing options to modify the numbering. There's a good reason why `RX=PolynomialRing(R,'x',n)` is allowed: it's clearly desirable to make "a polynomial ring in n variables" in various settings. Sage requires names for these variables, but specifying n names is bothersome if you don't care about the names. Hence the indexing. which agrees with what `RX.gen(i)` does. If you do care what your variable names are called, it's easy to specify a list of names. All kinds of possibilities exist: `["x_%s"%s for i in range(n)]`, `["x^(%s)"%s for i in range(1,n+1)]` etc. It's much better to teach people how to get full customizibility than to give them one more option to discover, which will probably not meet their needs if they develop further.

@nbruin : thanks for the prompt feedback :) but are you ok with df2e39f or not? notice that `*args` was missing there on the first place.

> Don't both return a result and inject bindings (and certainly don't go grabbing the global scope!). 

is there an alternative to `global_scope()`? i tried with just `R.inject_variables()` and it didn't work. i suppose it works via `return R.injected_variables()`, but then you don't have access to your vector of variables, right? for multiplication and so on, it is useful to have it.

> It's pretty clear that the behaviour of `var` to both inject and return variables is a mistake once you see the confusion it causes.

could you point me to some threads on this issue, so that i can catch up? for me there are no surprises with `var`. moreover, i find it practical that the function returns you the variables and/or allows you to use them in the console.

> Injection of polynomial variables is quite efficiently done with `PolynomialRing(R,'x',4).inject_variables()`, which prints a message and returns `None` on purpose.

ok, but let's agree it is a rather long construction for people with bad memory (i'm in that group).

> `polygen(*args)` is just a short form of `PolynomialRing(*args).gens()` which helps people who know what a polynomial variable is but not what a polynomial ring is. I think it's a bad design decision to muddle this with other features.

yes (essentially i'm on that group, too). that's arguable: why should a feature bother at all? so long as it is consistent with the rest & well documented.. (more on this below)

> If you do care what your variable names are called, it's easy to specify a list of names. All kinds of possibilities exist: `["x_%s"%s for i in range(n)]`, `["x^(%s)"%s for i in range(1,n+1)]` etc.

that's definitely not easy. 

> It's much better to teach people how to get full customizibility than to give them one more option to discover, which will probably not meet their needs if they develop further.

i get the point about "teaching a man to fish", 100%. at the same time, i'm with the lazy people here: if someone thought the solution and shows you a little example in command help, then i prefer using it rather than working it out myself (saves time, and is less error-prone). 

for the point on features: what about LaTeX? in general people are happy with lots and lots of customizations ready to be discovered.

It might be that passing `*args` on wholesale is problematic (it causes erroneous parameters to be reported with a deeper traceback), but I don't see a big problem immediately. That's also something that is easy to fix later.\n\nConcerning your other queries:\n- in python it is usual that routines that are called because of their side-effects don't return anything.

Yes, that looks pretty straightforward. It might be that passing `*args` on wholesale is problematic (it causes erroneous parameters to be reported with a deeper traceback), but I don't see a big problem immediately. That's also something that is easy to fix later.

Concerning your other queries:

Sage is getting large and mature enough that if there is a reasonable way of doing something, we should be hesitant about adding alternative constructions.

got it. df2e39f does solve the ticket's requirement. yet i suggest to leave it in the current status for 1 week in case someone else want to chime in.

BTW I'm willing to learn and apply the more robust solution if you have time now (or in the future).

Yes, I need a year or two (more than just time, certainly!) to just grasp what is convenient or not in terms of good design from an expert Python / Sage developer's standpoint. 

No, I don't need a year or two to know that any of the possibilities that you suggest `["x_%s"%s for i in range(n)]`, `["x^(%s)"%s for i in range(1,n+1)]` are not easy. Just because of this:

- Maple (born 1982) -- `Vector(n, symbol = x)`

- Matlab (born 1984) -- `sym('x', [n 1])`

- Mathematica (born 1988) -- `Array[x, n]`

- SymPy (born 2007) -- `symbols('x:n')`. 

Matrices are constructed in a similar way.

Doesn't `vector(polygen(QQ,'x',n))` and `matrix(n,m,polygen(QQ,'x',n*m))` fit the bill for that? We need a little more symbols, but that's because sage is more explicit about the ring over which one works.

Oh yes, that's a nice construction for `\mathcal{M}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{K}[x])` (minor: it is the plural, `polygens`). 

Another thing that the commercial software have in common is that they follow mainstream Linear Algebra convention about variable names. That construction doesn't, especially:

```
sage: matrix(2, 4, polygens(QQ, 'x', 8))

[x0 x1 x2 x3]
[x4 x5 x6 x7]
```

What do you people think about the following. There is an open ticket #13703 which targets common matrix constructors. In the same spirit as the polytope library (type `polytopes.?`), with some work we can have a comprehensive matrix library, `matrices.?`, that features in particular:

```
sage: matrices.symbolic(2)

[a11 a12]
[a21 a22]

- Teaching : undergraduate level or before using [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath). 
- Mathematical Modeling : to represent an optimization variable in a semidefinite program.  

I'd be delighted to go deeper into any of these use cases, or to further exchange our ideas and ideals about less concrete, open-ended issues that innocent #22809 has raised, such as why this very basic construct exists in all the software cited before, while we shouldn't expect a useful answer for the inverse of a big matrix whose coefficients are variables. 

But, is this relevant at all to #22809? Maybe in Sage-devel?

You can do that if you care about preserving in the history that a change was made and rolled back. In a case like this I would just go with the branch that does NOT have the changes  that were rolled back (rebase, or otherwise rebuild your branch into the state you want directly). Rebasing becomes a real problem if other people have branches based on your branch. I don't think that's an issue here.
