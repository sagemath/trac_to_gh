The number of generators of a polynomial can be specified as a number:

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 4).gens()
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

This ticket should allow doing: 

```
sage: polygens(QQ, 'x', 4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

Currently it returns `TypeError: polygens() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)`.

great idea! it is very useful that these variables 'exist' in the calling method.
as you can see in revised patch i used `get_main_globals` to get around the issue.

how does it look? does someone suggest other examples?

ok, thanks for pointing that out! although it seems to me that #11576 is an advanced version of the simpler (but yet lacking) uses `var('x', 4)` and `var('x', 4, 4)` for vectors and matrices respectively. or i'm missing some basic reason why they don't exist already?

Don't both return a result and inject bindings (and certainly don't go grabbing the global scope!). It's pretty clear that the behaviour of `var` to both inject and return variables is a mistake once you see the confusion it causes.

Injection of polynomial variables is quite efficiently done with `PolynomialRing(R,'x',4).inject_variables()`, which prints a message and returns `None` on purpose.

`polygen(*args)` is just a short form of `PolynomialRing(*args).gens()` which helps people who know what a polynomial variable is but not what a polynomial ring is. I think it's a bad design decision to muddle this with other features.

I'm also against providing options to modify the numbering.

is there an alternative to `global_scope()`? i tried with just `R.inject_variables()` and it didn't work. i suppose it works via `return R.injected_variables()`, but then you don't have access to your vector of variables, right? for multiplication and so on, it is useful to have it.

> It's pretty clear that the behaviour of `var` to both inject and return variables is a mistake once you see the confusion it causes.


could you point me to some threads on this issue, so that i can catch up? for me there are no surprises with `var`. moreover, i find it practical that the function returns you the variables and/or allows you to use them in the console.

> Injection of polynomial variables is quite efficiently done with `PolynomialRing(R,'x',4).inject_variables()`, which prints a message and returns `None` on purpose.


ok, but let's agree it is a rather long construction for people with bad memory (i'm in that group).

> `polygen(*args)` is just a short form of `PolynomialRing(*args).gens()` which helps people who know what a polynomial variable is but not what a polynomial ring is. I think it's a bad design decision to muddle this with other features.


yes (essentially i'm on that group, too). that's arguable: why should a feature bother at all? so long as it is consistent with the rest & well documented.. (more on this below)

> If you do care what your variable names are called, it's easy to specify a list of names. All kinds of possibilities exist: `["x_%s"%s for i in range(n)]`, `["x^(%s)"%s for i in range(1,n+1)]` etc.


that's definitely not easy. 

> It's much better to teach people how to get full customizibility than to give them one more option to discover, which will probably not meet their needs if they develop further.


i get the point about "teaching a man to fish", 100%. at the same time, i'm with the lazy people here: if someone thought the solution and shows you a little example in command help, then i prefer using it rather than working it out myself (saves time, and is less error-prone). 

for the point on features: what about LaTeX? in general people are happy with lots and lots of customizations ready to be discovered.

Yes, that looks pretty straightforward. It might be that passing `*args` on wholesale is problematic (it causes erroneous parameters to be reported with a deeper traceback), but I don't see a big problem immediately. That's also something that is easy to fix later.

Concerning your other queries:
- in python it is usual that routines that are called because of their side-effects don't return anything. Compare `L.sort()` versus `sorted(L)`
- just google or search the documentation for the number of examples of `y=var('y')` etc.
- I don't think you will find many people who would give LaTeX as an example of a well-designed interface.
- implementing extra features adds bloat and other maintenance burden, and makes it more confusing for new people, because now they will be confronted with multiple ways of doing things. See "The zen of python". Not all of it applies to math software, but generally the ideas there have worked well to keep python a pleasant and easy to learn language.

That said, nothing prevents you from making your own convenience library functions and maintaining them in your own installation. Once they have been sitting around for a year or two and you're finding that you use them often, you'll have a nice body of code to demonstrate in exactly what way they are more convenient. Practice learns that what seems convenient when you're writing/designing something is often not used much in actual use.

Sage is getting large and mature enough that if there is a reasonable way of doing something, we should be hesitant about adding alternative constructions.

> ok, thanks for pointing that out! although it seems to me that #11576 is an advanced version of the simpler (but yet lacking) uses var('x', 4) and var('x', 4, 4) for vectors and matrices respectively. or i'm missing some basic reason why they don't exist already?


Because nobody has both implemented and reviewed them.  Lots of [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) around exactly what the defaults and syntax should be.

got it. df2e39f does solve the ticket's requirement. yet i suggest to leave it in the current status for 1 week in case someone else want to chime in.

BTW I'm willing to learn and apply the more robust solution if you have time now (or in the future).

Yes, I need a year or two (more than just time, certainly!) to just grasp what is convenient or not in terms of good design from an expert Python / Sage developer's standpoint. 

No, I don't need a year or two to know that any of the possibilities that you suggest `["x_%s"%s for i in range(n)]`, `["x^(%s)"%s for i in range(1,n+1)]` are not easy. Just because of this:

- Maple (born 1982) -- `Vector(n, symbol = x)`

- Matlab (born 1984) -- `sym('x', [n 1])`

- Mathematica (born 1988) -- `Array[x, n]`

- SymPy (born 2007) -- `symbols('x:n')`. 

Matrices are constructed in a similar way.

Doesn't `vector(polygen(QQ,'x',n))` and `matrix(n,m,polygen(QQ,'x',n*m))` fit the bill for that? We need a little more symbols, but that's because sage is more explicit about the ring over which one works.

Oh yes, that's a nice construction for `\mathcal{M}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{K}[x])` (minor: it is the plural, `polygens`). 

Another thing that the commercial software have in common is that they follow mainstream Linear Algebra convention about variable names. That construction doesn't, especially:

```
sage: matrix(2, 4, polygens(QQ, 'x', 8))

[x0 x1 x2 x3]
[x4 x5 x6 x7]
```

What do you people think about the following. There is an open ticket #13703 which targets common matrix constructors. In the same spirit as the polytope library (type `polytopes.?`), with some work we can have a comprehensive matrix library, `matrices.?`, that features in particular:

```
sage: matrices.symbolic(2)

[a11 a12]
[a21 a22]

- Teaching : undergraduate level or before using [SageMath](SageMath). 
- Mathematical Modeling : to represent an optimization variable in a semidefinite program.  

I'd be delighted to go deeper into any of these use cases, or to further exchange our ideas and ideals about less concrete, open-ended issues that innocent #22809 has raised, such as why this very basic construct exists in all the software cited before, while we shouldn't expect a useful answer for the inverse of a big matrix whose coefficients are variables. 

But, is this relevant at all to #22809? Maybe in Sage-devel?
