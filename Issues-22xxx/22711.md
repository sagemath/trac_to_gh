`clang++` refuses to guess the correct `return` statement. Also, `delete[]` must not be mixed up with `delete`. This ticket fixes these issues, and allows #22679 to go forward.

OK perhaps, but not until next week.  I am very receptive to pull requests into eclib.  I am strongly opposed to patching eclib for Sage independently of that.

Note also that there has been a new release of eclib for several weeks waiting for a positive review --jdemeyer got close but then it got forgotten.

Please change the "no feedback yet" tag -- this is feedback.

The patch here catches one more missing `[]` in delete (thus a memory leak) in `libsrc/newforms.cc` (after line 1665), a missing `return bd;` just after line 109 in `libsrc/htconst.cc` (something which `clang++ 3.8` does not forgive you, resulting in lots of errors).

So these absolutely must be fixed.

There is also some more, regarding shifting negative values (undefined behavour in C++).

For the latter, I haven't done the complete job---it appears to be still working without it. Let's complete this fixing, cause it's just trouble in waiting to hit after a compiler update...
One should start off #22164, naturally.

Will do. For the master branch, right?

in the diff fragment below `#define QS_LONG_MASK (~(-1L<<QS_LONG_SHIFT))`
is such an example; putting extra pair of brackets as done in the diff fixes this.

This matches one from ratpoints I fixed some time ago. But there are more, hopefully equally unambiguous. 

It's more problematic if you do `x<<y` for x a signed variable;
I'd probably not want to touch these myself, as this would require either changing the type of x, or copying abs(x) to an unsigned thing, and putting the sign back then.

Hold off since I have already fixed the two specific things you mentioned.

That's unfortunate -- this code was adapted from a (now very old) version of ratpoints, and that sort of macro is not my style at all.

I am not sure what to do next, so I will push the changes I already made to github.

Now which country did you grow up in, I seem to have forgotten?

Running ptestlong gives only these:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/calculus/interpolators.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/finance/time_series.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
```
none of w3hich are related to eclib -- and it's a beta release which I had not tested with the old eclib.
