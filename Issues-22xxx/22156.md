<a id='comment:4'></a>I give a positive review to this ticket, which indeed helps.

However I found that `eps_rel` does not work as expected. In Sage 8.2:

```
sage: f=dickman_rho(0.0523181439086600*log(131072/5*sqrt(2/55)*abs((762542078110

sage: numerical_integral(f,0,pi,eps_rel=0.01)
(1.3770603038627704e-09, 1.8216219493502225e-10)
sage: numerical_integral(f,0,pi,eps_abs=1.3770603038627704e-09/100)
(1.3729027501632004e-09, 1.3179032362874876e-11)
```
We see that the error with `eps_rel=0.01` is not less than 1% as expected.
But `exp_abs` works.
