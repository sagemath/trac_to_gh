Now that we have moved past 7.6.beta6 (I work off Volker's tree usually) I have the failures in `symbolic/expression.pyx` and `functions/orthogonal_polys.py` again. For the later it is even stranger, I get the failure only the first time I run the test, subsequent testing of `functions/orthogonal_polys.py` pass but not `symbolic/expression.pyx`.\n\nCould it be caused by ginac, since I still have it enabled in pynac? But why would it re-appear after 7.6.beta6 has been released?",

Something weird is happening to me here in sage-on-gentoo. Tests were OK after merging of this and #22057. Now that we have moved past 7.6.beta6 (I work off Volker's tree usually) I have the failures in `symbolic/expression.pyx` and `functions/orthogonal_polys.py` again. For the later it is even stranger, I get the failure only the first time I run the test, subsequent testing of `functions/orthogonal_polys.py` pass but not `symbolic/expression.pyx`.

Could it be caused by ginac, since I still have it enabled in pynac? But why would it re-appear after 7.6.beta6 has been released?

Giac? Yes that's why I disabled it again (comment:17). On the other hand if the problems persist even when you disable it too, then please open a ticket because that would be unexpected.
