Could it be caused by ginac, since I still have it enabled in pynac? But why would it re-appear after 7.6.beta6 has been released?

Giac? Yes that's why I disabled it again (comment:17). On the other hand if the problems persist even when you disable it too, then please open a ticket because that would be unexpected.
