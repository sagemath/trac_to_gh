```
These error messages are not really informative of what the problem really is:

```

sage: K = NumberField(x^2-2,'s')
sage: s = K.0
sage: L = NumberField(x^3-2,'t')
sage: t = L.0
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,s],[t,0]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Objects_with_category' object has no attribute 'is_exact'

```

similar problem with `floats`:

```

sage: f = float(1.1)
sage: f
1.1
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[f]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'is_exact'

```

The constructor could try to detect the problem and return an informative message.

Once this is fixed, ticket #22552 is a follow-up ticket that should be fixed easily from the present resolution.

<a id='comment:20'></a>Yes, that's what I mean; there is no need to distinguish the parents for QQ and ZZ. 

The method for computing an ehrhart polynomial should also be available for rational polytopes; being a lattice polytope is merely a sufficient condition for getting an ehrhart polynomial. If the user asks for the ehrhart polynomial but the counting function is a quasipolynomial (with a true period), then an exception should be raised by the method.

<a id='comment:37'></a>hi, 

i've adjusted the doctests in MIP and added the `int` construction test to JP's branch.

i had trouble with Python's `Fraction` though:

```
sage: from fractions import Fraction
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[Fraction(int(8), int(6))]])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

any ideas?

<a id='comment:38'></a>I think that those two functions should be fixed to work with `Fraction`

```
sage: from sage.structure.coerce import py_scalar_to_element, py_scalar_parent
sage: f = fractions.Fraction(2r, 3r)
sage: py_scalar_parent(type(f))    # should be QQ
sage: py_scalar_to_element(f)      # should be Rational
Fraction(2, 3)
```
(could be a dependency ticket)
