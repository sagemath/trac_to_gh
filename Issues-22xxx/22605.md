```
These error messages are not really informative of what the problem really is:

```

sage: K = NumberField(x^2-2,'s')
sage: s = K.0
sage: L = NumberField(x^3-2,'t')
sage: t = L.0
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[0,s],[t,0]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'Objects_with_category' object has no attribute 'is_exact'

```

similar problem with `floats`:

```

sage: f = float(1.1)
sage: f
1.1
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[f]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: type object 'float' has no attribute 'is_exact'

```

The constructor could try to detect the problem and return an informative message.

Once this is fixed, ticket #22552 is a follow-up ticket that should be fixed easily from the present resolution.

Depends on #23345

If this:

is all we need, I guess so... It would do a similar trick as for RR with 53 bits of precision...

Instead of the manual `float -> RDF` you should use `py_scalar_parent` from `sage.structure.coercion`. By the way, where the conversion `Python int -> ZZ` is happening? This should be done at the same time.

I'm looking at the last commit and at line 488 of the constructor, I got puzzled a bit...

If you give a polyhedron with an `H`-representation and specified the `base_ring=ZZ`, then it would convert it automatically to `QQ`? What if the user is clever and knows that the `H`-representation that is given really describes a lattice polytope and would like to specify its parent to be Polyhedron_ZZ. So forcing the `base_ring` should be possible?

I have #22754 in mind as an example.

I'll try to put some time on this, but I will look at the trac only sporadically in the next 2 weeks.

hi, 

i've adjusted the doctests in MIP and added the `int` construction test to JP's branch.

i had trouble with Python's `Fraction` though:

```

any ideas?

- [comment:42](#comment%3A42), doctest in `constructor.py`, done (upon merging with #23345)
- [comment:42](#comment%3A42), doctest in `finite_coxeter_groups.py` : i'm confused. the UniversalCyclotomicField should still be supported in the constructor, right? in this case:

    - the base ring is `UniversalCyclotomicField()`, and `base_ring not in Rings()` is False
    - `RDF.has_coerce_map_from(UniversalCyclotomicField())` is also False
- [comment:43](#comment%3A43), done

The following does work

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup(['I',7])
sage: n = W.one().canonical_matrix().rank()
sage: weights = W.fundamental_weights()
sage: point = [ZZ.one()] * n
sage: v = sum(point[i-1] * weights[i] for i in weights.keys())
sage: vertices = [(v*w).change_ring(AA) for w in W]
sage: Polyhedron(vertices)
```
It is perhaps not optimal, but fixes the issue with Coxeter groups.

i was getting:

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['A',3])
...
ImportError: the GAP3 package 'chevie' is needed to work with (complex) reflection groups
sage: is_package_installed("gap3")
False
```

and got scared with the message below.. but installing turned out to be very fast!

```

```

anyway, testing with `--optional=gap3` flag i do find problems. those tests with the `ReflectionGroup` and integer base ring were failing. 

in the new commit, i'm 'hardcoding' the base ring that is passed to the constructor to be QQ in those cases (before, this was guessed from the vertices). what do you think?
