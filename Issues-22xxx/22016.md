The problem lies in the file `src/sage/plot/plot3d/index_face_set.pyx`, where the json is generated. There are two problems with the generated json:

1. The quote signs used in the file are `'` and not `"` as per [Json spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf).
2. Every dictionary key is unquoted, which is incorrect. Thus, a point 
    
        {x:0,y:0,z:0}
        
    should really be

        {"x":0,"y":0,"z":0}
        
    as per Json spec.

Seems ok with the canvas3d viewer (in sagenb):

```
sage: u,v = var('u,v')
sage: def cf(u,v): return sin(u+v/2)**2
sage: P = parametric_plot3d((cos(u), sin(u)+cos(v), sin(v)),
....: (u,0,2*pi), (v,-pi,pi), color=(cf,colormaps.PiYG), plot_points=[60,60])
sage: P.show(viewer='canvas3d')
```
Needs to be tested in other kinds of notebooks.

Ok also in jupyter notebook. Remains to check in cloud (not that easy).

I would like to point out that this modification will bloat Three.js files without any change to the rendering, since JavaScript doesn't care whether array keys are quoted or not.
