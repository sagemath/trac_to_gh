In this ticket we will implement tete-a-tete graphs. These are ribbon graphs together with a metric on its edges satisfying a certain property (the tete-a-tete property). These are an original idea by the mathematician Norbert A'Campo in [A2009]. A tete-a-tete graph encodes the mapping class of an automorphism of a surface with boundary that restricts to the identity to the boundary of this surface and whose mapping class is periodic (when we allow isotopies to rotate the boundary components). Also some ideas were further developed by C. Graf, an student of A'Campo in [G2015]. Also, my current PhD thesis develops other aspects of these graphs.

These are some of the ideas that will be implemented in this ticket:

* A class of objects called *TatGraph* (tat stands for tete-a-tete). This  includes the notion of relative tat graph, which are a kind of graphs that allow to permute certain boundary components of the thickening of the underlying ribbon graph.
* Numerous methods for the class above, for instance:
    - Rotation numbers around each boundary component
    - Matrix depicting the action on the first homology group of the ribbon graph with respect to the basis given by RibbonGraph.homology_basis()
    - Global method to find the end of a safewalk of a certain length.
    - Global method that produces examples of tat graphs. In particular it produces all Milnor fibers and monodromies of the Brieskorn-Pham singularities.
    - Orbit graph, this is a ribbon graph that corresponds to the orbit space resulting from taking the quotient of the original underlying ribbon graph by the action the the automorphism induced by the tat property.

No I haven't been able to solve it and yes, I have also tried "git fetch -v trac u/pportilla/tat_graph-22016 && echo OK" and it returns the same kind of error " fatal: Couldn't find remote ref u/pportilla/tat_graph-22016"

I can checkout other tickets so I don't know what can be the problem.
