This patch adds a function that can be used to check if a lattice is subdirectly reducible. There is no "interface" yet.

Like this?

I think it is necessary to have definitions on frontend. However, it feels odd to copy them to internal functions. But then `lattices.py` should depend on `hasse_diagram.py`, not other way, so this link would go to "wrong direction" in some sense.

Btw, I think that explaining congruence would be best done with a picture.

Since this will probably end up being on the front-end at the end of the day, it will probably be moved there. However, I just wanted something there for reference until that happens. Thanks.
