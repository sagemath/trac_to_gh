<a id='comment:16'></a>Thanks for taking a look at this ticket. There's a bug in the code such that list(DescendingPlanePartitions(n)) gives some repeated elements and skips some elements. A fix is to add the line:

dpprow = copy(dpprow)

before all the other code in the _increment_row(dpp) method.

Also in the documentation, we should reference arxiv paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05779 for more information about Catalan DPPs.

I don't have time to work on this now, but I wanted to comment about those two things while I was thinking of it.

Hi `@`jessicapalencia can you give an example to reproduce the bug, I tried till n = 7 with and without adding line `dpprow = copy(dpprow)` but the output of `list(DescendingPlanePartitions(n))` was same.
