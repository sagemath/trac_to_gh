The sagemath-doc-en Debian package is 700MB when installed, making it one of the largest (non-debug, non-data) packages in Debian. About 300MB of this is redundant:

```
$ find */en/ -name _static -type d | xargs -rn1 du -hs
30M	html/en/developer/_static
30M	html/en/constructions/_static
30M	html/en/a_tour_of_sage/_static
30M	html/en/reference/_static
30M	html/en/faq/_static
30M	html/en/prep/_static
30M	html/en/thematic_tutorials/_static
30M	html/en/website/_static
30M	html/en/installation/_static
30M	html/en/_static
30M	html/en/tutorial/_static
$ find */en/ -name _static -type d | xargs -rn1 diff -ru html/en/_static
Only in html/en/developer/_static: flowchart.dia
Only in html/en/developer/_static: flowchart.pdf
Only in html/en/developer/_static: flowchart.svg
Only in html/en/developer/_static: meld-screenshot.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
Only in html/en/_static: pdf.png
```

It would be good to deduplicate this, to reduce the cost for users of keeping this installed.
