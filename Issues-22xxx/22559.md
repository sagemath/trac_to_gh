The Hopcroft-Karp and Eppstein algorithms as implemented in NetworkX
compute matchings for bipartite graphs faster than the algorithms for
general graphs. I've included an override of the matching method in the
bipartite graph class, with parameters that allow for using the old
algorithms if desired.

                 use_edge_labels=False, solver=None, verbose=0):

  ```
  (and end with `"""`).
* For the wikipedia, use

  ```
  :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
  ```
  which handles all of the linking and formatting.
* Change the first ``use_edge_labels`` to:

  ```
          - when set to ``True``, computes a weighted matching where each
            edge is weighted by its label (if an edge has no label, `1` is
            assumed); ignored if ``algorithm`` is not ``"Edmonds"``, ``"LP"``

Ok, I see. Thank you for the feedback. I fixed the things you pointed out, but I changed the phrasing away from "ignored if ``algorithm`` is not ``"Edmonds"``, ``"LP"``" because it's now configured to raise an error if `use_edge_labels==True` but `algorithm` is not set to `"Edmonds"` or `"LP"`.

I adapted the code from the matching method of graph.py. Perhaps that would have been cleaner.

Well... actually, there is a another issue with the wikipedia link. Sorry.

This

```
        For more information, see the `Wikipedia article on matchings
        :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
```
produces something like `For more information, see the Wikipediaarticleonmatchings:wikipedia:âMatching(graphtheory)`. Check the html.

So you should write

```
        For more information, see :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
```
or even better

```
    .. SEEALSO::

        - :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
        - :meth:`~Graph.matching`
```
no need for blank line between bullets here.

Sorry I did not pass tests on the full library when reviewing this ticket. 


One solution is to set the algorithm to `None` 

```
    def matching(self, value_only=False, algorithm=None,
                 use_edge_labels=False, solver=None, verbose=0):
```
and then to add after `self._scream_if_not_simple()`:

```
        if algorithm is None:
            if use_edge_labels:
                algorithm = "Edmonds"
            else:
                algorithm = "Hopcroft-Karp"
```
You will have to update the documentation accordingly, for instance like 

```
        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Hopcroft-Karp"`` if
          ``use_edge_labels==False``, otherwise ``"Edmonds"``)

``` 

and add a tests on a weighted graph like:

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: B = BipartiteGraph([(u,v,2) for u,v in G.edges(labels=0)])
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True)
[(0, 3, 2), (1, 2, 2)]
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True)
4
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Edmonds')
4
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='LP')
4.0
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Eppstein')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: use_edge_labels can not be used with Hopcroft-Karp or Eppstein
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Hopcroft-Karp')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: use_edge_labels can not be used with Hopcroft-Karp or Eppstein
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Hopcroft-Karp')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Eppstein')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Edmonds')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='LP')
2
```

I had to create a new branch since I cannot push in branch `u/zgershkoff/matchings_in_bipartite_graphs`. The new branch is in `public/`, so you can push commits as well.

Bipartite graphs are used in the following modules. The new branch passes all tests (on my computer), but it's better to double check (as well as docbuild, etc.).

```
src/sage/combinat/
src/sage/game_theory/
src/sage/graphs/
src/sage/groups/
src/sage/matrix/
src/sage/matroids/
```

Let's hope this ticket will soon be finalized ;)

That is the correct behavior and the correct thing to do.

LGTM too. Thanks.
