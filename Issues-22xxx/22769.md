Here is a small example of the error

```
m1 = matrix(QQ, 1, 0, [])
m2 = matrix(QQ, 2, 2, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print m1.tensor_product(m2)
```

Of course, the correct tensor product of these two matrices should be given by

```
matrix(QQ, 2, 0, [])
```

It could be that the problem is coming from the block matrix structure.

Isn't it a problem with `block_matrix`

```
sage: block_matrix(0, 2, [])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: invalid nrows/ncols passed to block_matrix
```
EDIT: no! since `block_matrix` has no way to understand the size of the matrices in the empty list!

Note that the following does work

```
sage: block_matrix(2, 2, [[matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)], [matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)]])
[]
sage: parent(_)
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 4 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```

That should also work as those arguments are:

```
    -  ``nrows`` - the number of block rows

    -  ``ncols`` - the number of block cols
```
IMO, changing it so that it goes through that construction seems like overkill in trying to follow the definition exactly rather than equivalent code.

Somewhat surprising, it is faster to pass nothing than to make a copy:

sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 4, 3)
sage: %timeit MS.zero().__copy__()
The slowest run took 18.18 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

sage: %timeit MS()

So `zero()` is cached, but `@cached_method` does not optimize for aliases that well:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 4, 3)
sage: %timeit MS.zero_matrix()
The slowest run took 1624.29 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 61.6 ns per loop
sage: %timeit MS.zero()
The slowest run took 10.05 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.58 µs per loop
```
So I converted to use `MS.zero_matrix().__copy__()`, which ends up being the same path that `MS()` uses, but is more direct.

I'm allowing myself a change back to positive review since it is essentially a trivial change and tests pass.
