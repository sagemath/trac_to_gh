Here is a small example of the error

```
m1 = matrix(QQ, 1, 0, [])
m2 = matrix(QQ, 2, 2, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print m1.tensor_product(m2)
```

Of course, the correct tensor product of these two matrices should be given by

```
matrix(QQ, 2, 0, [])
```

It could be that the problem is coming from the block matrix structure.

Isn't it a problem with `block_matrix`

```
sage: block_matrix(0, 2, [])
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: invalid nrows/ncols passed to block_matrix
```
EDIT: no! since `block_matrix` has no way to understand the size of the matrices in the empty list!

Note that the following does work

```
sage: block_matrix(2, 2, [[matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)], [matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)]])
[]
sage: parent(_)
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 4 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```

That should also work as those arguments are:

```
    -  ``nrows`` - the number of block rows

    -  ``ncols`` - the number of block cols
```
IMO, changing it so that it goes through that construction seems like overkill in trying to follow the definition exactly rather than equivalent code.

<div id="comment:19" align="right">comment:19</div>

So `zero()` is cached, but `@cached_method` does not optimize for aliases that well:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ, 4, 3)
sage: %timeit MS.zero_matrix()
The slowest run took 1624.29 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000000 loops, best of 3: 61.6 ns per loop
sage: %timeit MS.zero()
The slowest run took 10.05 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.58 µs per loop
```
So I converted to use `MS.zero_matrix().__copy__()`, which ends up being the same path that `MS()` uses, but is more direct.

I'm allowing myself a change back to positive review since it is essentially a trivial change and tests pass.
