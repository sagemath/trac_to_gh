Here is a small example of the error

```
m1 = matrix(QQ, 1, 0, [])
m2 = matrix(QQ, 2, 2, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print m1.tensor_product(m2)
```

Of course, the correct tensor product of these two matrices should be given by

```
matrix(QQ, 2, 0, [])
```

It could be that the problem is coming from the block matrix structure.

```
sage: block_matrix(0, 2, [])
Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: invalid nrows/ncols passed to block_matrix

EDIT: no! since `block_matrix` has no way to understand the size of the matrices in the empty list!

Note that the following does work

```
sage: block_matrix(2, 2, [[matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)], [matrix(0,2), matrix(0,2)]])
[]
sage: parent(_)
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 4 dense matrices over Integer Ring

That should also work as those arguments are:

```
    -  ``nrows`` - the number of block rows

    -  ``ncols`` - the number of block cols
```
IMO, changing it so that it goes through that construction seems like overkill in trying to follow the definition exactly rather than equivalent code.
