Looks good.

There's actually an issue with `pos_dict` and `add_*` methods. For example, starting with a barbell graph with two triangles and a path connecting them, and then adding a clique for the vertices on the path, the layout will not change, and the `.plot()` call will not show the extra added edges.

But apparently this is a different issue?

The problem you raise is a different issue. The edges are here, but since the position of the vertices are fixed, the edges are drawn on the same line, so we cannot distinguish them. 
Somehow, we should have curved edges instead of straight lines, but I really don't know how to do that.

Thanks for the quick review.
