There's actually an issue with `pos_dict` and `add_*` methods. For example, starting with a barbell graph with two triangles and a path connecting them, and then adding a clique for the vertices on the path, the layout will not change, and the `.plot()` call will not show the extra added edges.

But apparently this is a different issue?

Somehow, we should have curved edges instead of straight lines, but I really don't know how to do that.

Thanks for the quick review.
