When running `sage -t -a -p 0` in the develop Docker container (off a current version of the develop branch) I'm getting:

```

```

but only sometimes.  Seems like maybe a test ordering issue.

I noticed that these mutation_class files get written to the user's actual `DOT_SAGE` directory while running the tests.  Do the tests not use a temp dir for `DOT_SAGE`?

For what it's worth, from knowledge of the mathematical context and code:

I would say that a priori this result cannot happen unless Q is something else that the value given in the previous line. How this can happen is unknown to me.

There is caching of the result in `Q._mutation_type`. So the problem may come from a cache confusion (objets sharing their hash ?) ?

I think I know the issue.  To avoid infinite loops when trying to figure out what the mutation type is, the first step in the command Q.mutation_type() for quivers is to run "Q.is_mutation_finite()" (unless the type of Q is already known from the start).

However, as is documented, this command "Uses a non-deterministic method by random mutations in various directions. Can result in a wrong answer."

I'm surprised that so many wrong answers are arising from this non-deterministic process, but it seems like the pseudo-random seeds are being consistently poorly chosen for this example.  

Anyway, I agree that this is leading to potentially wrong answers but unless we change the "is_mutation_finite" command, this is not an entirely unexpected bug, but part of the way the code was written for computational efficiency sake.

I agree with Gregg: this is, in general, an artifact that comes from the non
deterministic nature of `mutation_type`. Probably this method, and anything else calling `is_mutation_finite`, should mention
explicitly how it works in its documentation and have `# random` doctests.

On the other hand the specific error in the description of the ticket is yet
another instance of #22381. The quiver has only two non frozen vertices so it
should be recognized immediately. Coefficients mess things up.

I have made some micro-enhancements to the is_mutation_finite code.

This could help prevent the sporadic doctest failure, maybe.

Maybe try rebasing it, just for the heck of it?

*Always* is a strong word though.  To be clear, this was a very hard to reproduce issue, and when I run the tests for this code under normal circumstances it always passes.  It just happens that if the tests are run under certain conditions there must be *some* state of the RNG under which it ends up failing.

I could try to add some further diagnostics and try to reproduce the failure again, if you point me in the right direction as to what to add.

Okay, let's go through the problem step by step (and if below is correct, than this has nothing to do with this non-deterministic test, which I still ensure to be correctly working):

1. you call `Q.mutation_type()`.
2. you call `is_mutation_finite` which correctly determines its finiteness, resulting in following the `else` clause in l912.
3. your quiver is connected, so you call `_mutation_type_from_data` with optional argument `compute_if_necessary=False` on its unique component.
4. (I expect that you have not built the data, so this does not result in any hit.) This results in `mut_type_part == 'unknown'`.
5. you call `_connected_mutation_type` which can determine all finite mutation types from the infinite families (but not the exceptional types, including G2).
6. `--> I BET THIS CAUSES THE ISSUE <--` you again call `_mutation_type_from_data` with optional argument `compute_if_necessary=True`. This brute force computes all clusters of exceptional types (of correct rank) and writes the output into external files. These external files in `relative_filename = 'cluster_algebra_quiver/mutation_classes_%s.dig6'%n` are then finally checked.
7. As the final result, we obtain the mutation type as in your above output `mut_type_part = 'undetermined finite mutation type'`.

I am not to all depth into the context of your issue. But if I must place a bet, your doctest environment has a problem with writing these external files in (6) correctly and this causes the buggy behaviour.

Cheers, Christian

If I'm reading the code correctly, the files are written using `atomic_write` which should be free of race conditions while writing the file (fixed in #15534).

To debug further, it would be very interesting to know if the problem occurs when testing just a single file or only when testing in parallel.
