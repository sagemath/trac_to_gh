This was done purely using bash commands such as

```
grep -rl "<type 'function" src/sage/ | xargs sed -i "s/<type 'function/<... 'function/g"
```

Let us wait for the bots to check that no doctest was broken.

yes, that's good enough, for sure. Thanks for the review. This is preparation for python3, we are not yet at the stage where we can run sage in py3.

Bot is green, so this is certainly good to go.

Have you built the documentation after the change? There seem to be one ticket blocking the building of the documentation in https://github.com/vbraun/sage/compare/e901b1d912...59c3b04b68 
A plot in `generic_graph.py` is failing. This is the only ticket touching that file - which doesn't necessarily mean much.
