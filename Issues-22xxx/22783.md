Since this functionality just uses GAP calls, seems like it should be callable for groups which are accepted by GAP.

All these functions implemented for permutation groups, but those don't seem to inherit from the libgap library interface, so I've just added to that interface.

The reason why I could see this was only for permutation groups is because these won't work for infinite groups:

```
sage: G = GL(2, ZZ)
sage: G._gap_().NrConjugacyClasses()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, no method found! Error, no 4th choice method found for `ConjugacyClasses' on 1 arguments
```
So I think we should add a check if the group is infinite and raise a `NotImplementedError` if it is.

Note that things like `conjugacy_classes` results in the same error, but I think that should have a similar check (or catch the exception and raise a `NotImplementedError` in its place).

Do we also want to remove the corresponding methods from the permutation group? Is there a difference by using `ClassFunction_libgap` over `ClassFunction_gap`.

Two other little things, `Returns` -> `Return` and

```
- ``values`` -- a list of values of the character
```
with the double dash after the name.

A check for finite sounds good since the error from GAP isn't very informative.  I also noticed when doing this that the function

in permgroup.py

```
conjugacy_class_reprensentatives()
```

in libgap_mixin

```
conugacy_classes_reprensentatives()
```

So GL(2,GF(5)), both functions are available. Seems like we should be consistent with the names. Do I need to do a deprecation to change one of these, or can I just change it?


The class_function.py file says not to use ClassFunction_gap.


Since permutations groups don't inherit from the libgap class, I can't remove them from permutation groups with changing inheritance structures.

Ah, I see. So it is some old code in the generic case that needs to ported over to use libgap.

Ah, yes, and rightly so as a good part of the functionality is done purely on the Sage side.
