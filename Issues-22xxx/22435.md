The lines with `: not found` at the end are where in a normal install I can see this line: ` /bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c   libpynac.la '/home/ralf/sage/local/lib'`, so presumably this has something to do with `libtool`?

So far I've only observed it once.

What about the

It seems that there are two parallel make processes in the ginac subdirectory; If one is writing the install-libLTLIBRARIES script while the other is executing it the observed error  could easily happen.

What normally seems to happen is that make "puts a child on the chain" to remake the target (output snippet from `make -d`):
