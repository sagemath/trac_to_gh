This should be an error instead of silently being ignored.

Why not? I think that there are only two reasonable behaviours:

1. `G.add_edge(v,v)` should be an error.

2. `G.add_edge(v,v)` should force the graph to allow loops and then add the loop at `v`.

Silently doing nothing is just going to mask bugs.

> We also silently ignore repeated addition of the same edge which is extremely convenient for many operations on graphs


That's a different issue where the current behaviour makes sense. `G.add_edge(v, w)` ensures that there is an edge between `v` and `w`, regardless of whether an edge existed before.

It has been proposed with #15706 to choose the behavior at the creation of the graph, and that in the future graphs will by default be simple (without loops nor multiple edges).

```
sage: Graph([(0,0)])

  #!/usr/bin/env python

For me this is even more dangerous than silently ignoring loops.

To be clear, I am not in favour or this. I just said that this was "reasonable", not that it was the right thing to do. But silently ignoring invalid input is never the right thing to do.

I don't think it is so different: if I want two objects that are modeled by my graph to be connected, I give `G.add_edge(v, w)` command. Who knows how I have obtained `v` and `w`? Maybe the algorithm I am using can result in equal ones. So if I cannot silently "add" a loop to a loopless graph, it seems that I should not be able to silently "multiply" edges on graphs without multiple edges.

There is also a possibility of giving a user warning rather than raising exceptions...

The way I see it, the edges of a graph form a set. And Python handles `set.add(x)` if `x` is already in the set. It's not an error because it conforms with the mathematics of a set.

For loops, the situation is different because a loop simply cannot occur on a loopless graph.

Ok, let's go for this new behavior. The writing style will become heavier, but I agree it is more consistent.


Comments on the code:

In `src/sage/graphs/generators/intersection.py`, you modified the method `IntersectionGraph`. I don't understand the benefit of using `set(clique)` instead of `clique`. In fact you could use `G.add_clique(clique)`.

In `src/sage/knots/link.py`, I sugget the following to avoid multiple calls to `set(V[i])`

```
        V = G.vertices()
        for i in range(G.order() - 1):
            Vi = set(V[i])
            for j in range(i+1, G.order()):
                if Vi.intersection(V[j]):
                    G.add_edge(V[i], V[j])
        return [[list(i) for i in cc] for cc in G.connected_components()]
```

That change was actually needed because `clique` contains repeated elements. If `clique = [v, v]`, then `G.add_edge(v, v)` would be called, which breaks now.

> In fact you could use `G.add_clique(clique)`.


I didn't know about that method.

However, this ticket breaks it.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.add_clique([1,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   1489 
   1490         if not self.multiple_edges(None):

ValueError: cannot add edge from 1 to 1 in graph without loops

So either the `set` operation should be added to `add_clique`, or use `loops=False` in the `add_edges`, or...
