```
sage: G = Graph(3)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0)
sage: G.edges()
[]
```

This should be an error instead of silently being ignored.

That would be a big change and I'm not sure it's a good one. We also silently ignore repeated addition of the same edge which is extremely convenient for many operations on graphs (e.g., adding sets of edges, merging vertices, etc.).

```

Why not? I think that there are only two reasonable behaviours:

1. `G.add_edge(v,v)` should be an error.

2. `G.add_edge(v,v)` should force the graph to allow loops and then add the loop at `v`.

Silently doing nothing is just going to mask bugs.

> We also silently ignore repeated addition of the same edge which is extremely convenient for many operations on graphs

That's a different issue where the current behaviour makes sense. `G.add_edge(v, w)` ensures that there is an edge between `v` and `w`, regardless of whether an edge existed before.

It has been proposed with #15706 to choose the behavior at the creation of the graph, and that in the future graphs will by default be simple (without loops nor multiple edges).

For me this is even more dangerous than silently ignoring loops.

To be clear, I am not in favour or this. I just said that this was "reasonable", not that it was the right thing to do. But silently ignoring invalid input is never the right thing to do.

I don't think it is so different: if I want two objects that are modeled by my graph to be connected, I give `G.add_edge(v, w)` command. Who knows how I have obtained `v` and `w`? Maybe the algorithm I am using can result in equal ones. So if I cannot silently "add" a loop to a loopless graph, it seems that I should not be able to silently "multiply" edges on graphs without multiple edges.

There is also a possibility of giving a user warning rather than raising exceptions...

The way I see it, the edges of a graph form a set. And Python handles `set.add(x)` if `x` is already in the set. It's not an error because it conforms with the mathematics of a set.

For loops, the situation is different because a loop simply cannot occur on a loopless graph.

To see things in a different way: after doing `G.add_edge(u,v)`, then `G.has_edge(u,v)` should be `True`. This currently isn't the case.

Ok, let's go for this new behavior. The writing style will become heavier, but I agree it is more consistent.


Comments on the code:

In `src/sage/graphs/generators/intersection.py`, you modified the method `IntersectionGraph`. I don't understand the benefit of using `set(clique)` instead of `clique`. In fact you could use `G.add_clique(clique)`.

In `src/sage/knots/link.py`, I sugget the following to avoid multiple calls to `set(V[i])`

```
        V = G.vertices()
        for i in range(G.order() - 1):
            Vi = set(V[i])
            for j in range(i+1, G.order()):
                if Vi.intersection(V[j]):
                    G.add_edge(V[i], V[j])
        return [[list(i) for i in cc] for cc in G.connected_components()]
```

However, this ticket breaks it.

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.add_clique([1,1])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

   1489 
   1490         if not self.multiple_edges(None):

ValueError: cannot add edge from 1 to 1 in graph without loops

So either the `set` operation should be added to `add_clique`, or use `loops=False` in the `add_edges`, or...
