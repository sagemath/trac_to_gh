<a id='comment:3'></a>general problems appearing here:

* one cannot safely replace `__cmp__` by the pair `__eq__` and `__ne__` when comparison of the objects is needed.

* therefore one would need a general mechanism (in Parent or SageObject?) siimilar to the handling of rich comparison by `__richcmp__` in cython files

specific problem: one class requires `__cmp__` from its subclasses

```
NotImplementedError: Derived class <class 'sage.modular.abvar.homology.Homology_submodule_with_category'> should implement __cmp__

Here's a nifty little trick to simplify the code:

```
        b = all(self._map[g] == other._map[g]
                for g in self.parent().source().gens())
        return b == (op == op_EQ)
```
If you don't want to do it, then you can set a positive review.
