<a id='comment:1'></a>the result i was expecting is the sage object:
 
```
result = -(x*hypergeometric((1/2,1/2),(3/2,3/2),-x^2))+(sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x))/2
```


maybe one can substitute the line in `mma_free_integrator`:

```
ans = SR(mexpr.lower().replace('[', '(').replace(']', ')'))
```

with the some of the code at the mathematica interface in `_sage_` ?

(we don't need Mathematica to be installed!)

as you can see, there are two issues with the line above in this example. it transforms: 

```
-(x*HypergeometricPFQ[{1/2,1/2},{3/2,3/2},-x^2])+(Sqrt[Pi]*Erf[x]*Log[x])/2
```

into 

```
'-(x*hypergeometricpfq({1/2,1/2},{3/2,3/2},-x^2))+(sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x))/2'
```

these are (i) curly braces, (ii) the special function is not transformed properly (no use of the conversions dictionary)

<a id='comment:5'></a>notice that this change has an (arguably) adverse effect in test at lines 492-495 of `symbolic/integration/integral.py`. 

indeed, instead of 

```
sage: _ = var('x, y, z')
sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z
sage: f.integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free")   # optional - internet
x*y^z + sqrt(1/2)*sqrt(pi)*fresnels(sqrt(2)*x/sqrt(pi))
```

one has:

```
sage: _ = var('x, y, z')
sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z
sage: f.integrate(x, algorithm="mathematica_free")   # optional - internet
Traceback (most recent call last):
NotImplementedError: Don't know a Sage equivalent for Mathematica function 'FresnelS'.
```

the new issue is because Fresnel integrals are not implemented in Sage (right?) -- in other words, one cannot do much with the former result. 

That said, Sage could return a more verbose message like:

```
"Don't know a Sage equivalent for Mathematica function '%s'.

Unable to parse: %s" % m.group() % mexpr
```
