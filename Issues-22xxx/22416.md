A full-dimensional compact polytope is inscribed if there exists a point in space which is equidistant to all its vertices.

This function checks if this point exists and returns it if asked for.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Some more comments:

* The documentation should start with a one-sentence description, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings
* in describing the input, you should say that the default for `certificate` is False (look at other parts of Sage source code, as well as http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)
* the `OUTPUT` section should separate cases depending on the value of `certificate`.
* tests like `sage: q.is_inscribed(True)` could be misleading for the user. Where does the `True` comes from. You can write this since certificate is the first option, but it is not a required parameter, so you should prefer the more explicit `sage: q.is_inscribed(certificate=True)`.
* `simplex_vertices` works because you assume that the polytope is full-dimensional, you should add a short comment to explain that just before that command, so that we understand what happens (and it will ease the work of someone who might try to extend the method to non-full-dimensional polytopes).
* since you do not use `other_vertices` anymore, you should remove its definition
* you have:

```
if not self.is_compact() or not self.is_full_dimensional():
    raise NotImplementedError("This function is implemented for full-dimensional polytopes only.")
```
If the polyhedron is full-dimensional but not compact, the user will get a misleading message. So make two different tests/statements, this adds informations to the user.
