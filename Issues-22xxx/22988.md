I'm not sure if this

```python

```
is the correct way to access the modul objects in itself, but I'm not aware of any other way.

<a id='comment:27'></a>Hi Rusydi,

this is for a convenient way of iterating over all collected S-boxes.
Say you want to test some property for every S-box, you can then just iterate over this dictionary. Without this dictionary such an iteration would not be that easy.

I already used this dictionary several times and find it really handy to have it.
