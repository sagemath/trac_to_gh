From [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35839/sage-incorrectly-evaluates-series/):

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo)
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='maxima')
1/64*pi^2 - 1/12
```


but correct answer is `1/64*pi^2`. SymPy (with #22004) and Mathematica do it right:

```
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='mathematica')
1/64*pi^2
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')
1/64*pi^2
```

I am using version:

```
$ sage -standard | grep maxima
maxima..................................5.35.1.p2 (5.35.1.p2)     
```

See #18920 for the ticket updating maxima version.

**Keywords:** maxima

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

**Dependencies:** #18920

Just to say that a doctest is already testing this issue:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/calculus/calculus.py#L569

It was added in #22004 and updated during the upgrade to maxima 5.39.
