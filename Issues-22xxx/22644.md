Fix the [the interacts library](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/interacts/library.py)

1. Make it work in Jupyter.

2. Define `html(obj)` as `pretty_print(html(obj))` to fix lots of naked html results, sort of (printed rather than shown MathJax).

3. Fix issues which prevent certain interacts from running.

4. Actually test that the interacts work in Jupyter (currently, the code only checks that the interact is displayed, it does not test execution).

Oh yes I *very* much understand this, and I hope you are likewise not offended that some are just impossible to get to.

I am also frustrated that I do not have enough time to work on any Sage stuff but the ones I know will cause the most annoyance to other users and no one else will worry about - currently that is the Mac app on Sage 8.0.  This is already broken so although I want to get to it I know it's not likely in the next week.
