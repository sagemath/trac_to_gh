For #21598 I have a big patch that adds Cygwin support for psutil.  As I plan to upstream this work (which will still take a little more time) the patch is against the latest development version of psutil.

It will be good to add my psutil patches to Sage now, as this is a blocker for Cygwin support.  But it will be difficult to apply to an older version.

There are no changes between this version and the last one that should impact Sage, which only uses a small subset of psutil's functionality.
