Sage doesn't "think" it's a different value, Sage just hardcodes a different number.

So why does this default value for `rtol` even need to be equal to whatever `scipy` uses?

It needs to be greater than the documented minimum, otherwise we get errors.

From the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.brentq.html#scipy.optimize.brentq):

rtol [..] cannot be smaller than its default value of `4*np.finfo(float).eps`.

Oh, I dug a bit deeper and found that scipy changed the meaning of this flag between 0.17.1 and 0.18.1. Sage's current usage is also OK for the older version but not the newer version:

https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commit/cbd91b93c752eb2e947c2b657fe0471a12759b83#diff-9167bb8d33bd7d9eb5e07e0ebe18e05e

I'm unsure if this patch will cause any extra doctest failures for Sage upstream and scipy 0.17.1, but I guess we'll see that when a build is run.

(On Debian, we are also patching some doctests to expect slightly different float results, but I can't remember which of these are caused by scipy. The differences are minute, of course.)
