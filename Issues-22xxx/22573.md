This should be an error:

```
sage: [1,2,3]/2
```

I traced this to

```
sage: (1/2)._act_on_([1,2,3], False)
```
which uses the default implementation of `_act_on_` from `src/sage/structure/element.pyx`:

```python
    cpdef _act_on_(self, x, bint self_on_left):
        """
        Use this method to implement ``self`` acting on ``x``.

        Return None or raise a CoercionException if no
        such action is defined here.
        """
        return None
```

When I see this correctly, this is does not cause the problem. 

There is an action of an integer (from `ZZ`) on an list as in pure Python (repeating the list). But clearly there is no such action of `QQ`.
`discover_action` in `sage.structure.coerce` discovers an action in the following way: We have a list divided by `ZZ`-integer; the code says we do as with `mul`, but then precompose the action by the natural embedding of `ZZ` in `QQ` and use an inverse action. 

I am not sure what the correct solution would be. In some sense, the correct discovered action should be `QQ` on `list` and precompose it with invert element first.

Yes, maybe you are right. The problem is that not all places calling `_act_on_` check for `None`. I still think that the `return None` convention is fragile, but it's used in many places. So maybe you should keep that.

I think it is quite safe to replace the `return None` in all `_act_on_` (there are only 11 occurrences) by a `NotImplementedError` or similar. Usually they should not be called as the coercion model determines in a different way if there is an action; it is called only when computing the actual value. Thus, if "accidentally" called, at least the error appears.

Maybe something along the lines of

```
cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
action = cm.get_action(K, action.underlying_set(), operator.mul)
if action is not None:
    self._action = action
    ...
```
could do it, but I am not sure, if it is intended to call `get_action`, etc. at this level (in the action-class itself). And I am very doubtful about `operator.mul` as at the level of the action-class, everything is somehow independent of the operator.

Of course I do, because it is the right thing to do.

If I want an action of QQ on X, there is no point in looking for an action of ZZ on X. Because even if an action of ZZ on X exists, it does not imply that there is an action of QQ on X.

Note that the code in the coercion model already looks for an action from the fraction field:

```python
        if op is div:
            # Division on right is the same acting on right by inverse, if it is so defined.
            right_mul = None
            try:
                right_mul = self.get_action(R, S, mul)
            except NotImplementedError:
                self._record_exception()

            if right_mul is not None and not right_mul.is_left():
                try:
                    action = ~right_mul
                    if action.right_domain() != S:
                        action = PrecomposedAction(action, None,
                                                   action.right_domain()._internal_coerce_map_from(S))
                    return action
                except TypeError: # action may not be invertible
                    self._record_exception()

            # It's possible an action is defined on the fraction field itself.
            try:
                K = S._pseudo_fraction_field()
            except AttributeError:
                pass
            else:
                if K is not S:
                    try:
                        right_mul = self.get_action(R, K, mul)
                    except NotImplementedError:
                        self._record_exception()

                    if right_mul is not None and not right_mul.is_left():
                        try:
                            return PrecomposedAction(~right_mul, None, K.coerce_map_from(S))
                        except TypeError: # action may not be invertible
                            self._record_exception()
```
