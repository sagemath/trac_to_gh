An amazing insight is that if one wants to know to bounding box of the integer points, rather than of all points, then one can round down upper bounds and round up lower bounds.

This can make a huge difference for integer points enumeration.

Fixed the failures that resulted from empty bounding boxes; 
but there remain failures that result from different sorting orders of `integral_points`. 
Should I change all these doctests so that they become independent of the sorting order?
