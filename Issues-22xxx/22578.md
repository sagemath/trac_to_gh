An amazing insight is that if one wants to know to bounding box of the integer points, rather than of all points, then one can round down upper bounds and round up lower bounds.

This can make a huge difference for integer points enumeration.

I think the order has changed because a different enumeration strategy is selected. I don't think it's machine or address specific.
In my opinion, doctests should not rely on the order of lists whose ordering is unspecified by documentation; they should be rewritten using `sort` or `set`.

If you want to change the tests so that the order is sorted, go ahead. I would avoid using `set` since (unfortunately) the output may not be in a specific order. However, we can just change the output for now too. I can also make these changes if you want me to.
