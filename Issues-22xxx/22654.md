Code works. It took me a while to understand how to use that FIB function:

```
L = [0,0,0,0,0]
fib(L, 5)
L
```
in a cell returns `[0,0,0,0,0]`. Also why `fib` instead of `FIB`?

Finally, the doc from `fortran??` was helpful to me. I would suggest not only to copy the fortran code from `fortran??` doc but also include how to use it using numpy arrays:

```
            sage: import numpy
            sage: a = numpy.array(range(10), dtype=float)
            sage: fib(a, 10)
            sage: a
            array([  0.,   1.,   1.,   2.,   3.,   5.,   8.,  13.,  21.,  34.])
