```
Keywords: giac, integrate, symbolics

Provide a `giac_integrator` function, which relies on the external (but standard) Giac package.  

A test could be:

```
sage: integrate(abs(cos(x)), x, 0, 2*pi, algorithm='giac')
4
```
This test is chosen because (at the time or writing) Maxima gives a wrong result (`0`), SymPy gives i don't know (unevaluated), and Fricas (optional package) gives `'failed'`.

we may want to ensure a symbolic integral wrapper, for instance with (cf. #22138):

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: integral(x^n*sin(x), x, algorithm='giac')
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Giac output: integrate(x^n*sin(x),x)

but in other cases it already returns unevaluted:

```
sage: integrate(log(1+x)/x, x, 0, 1, algorithm='giac')
integrate(ln(x + 1)/x, x, 0, 1)

thanks for the review!

yes, IMO some action should be taken (for example to double check with numerical integrator and show a warning if nonsense is detected / dispatch another integrator for known issues eg. abs-trig or some special functions). i am not a big fan of 'blatantly wrong' answers, because from the user's point of view, it makes you loose a lot of confidence on the software.
