We should strongly consider putting a `_from_dict` into the `ModulesWithBasis` category and `dimension`, as well as `_dense_free_module` in the `FiniteDimensionalModulesWithBasis` category. We probably could also do a generic `_vector_` by getting the position of the key from `monomial_coefficients` in the basis. I had to do some very generic implementations here.
