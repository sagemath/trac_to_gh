I got an answer from Tristan Holmes. There are lattices that have congruence lattice having both maximal chains satisfying and not satisfying the needed property. Hence the code can not be easily optimized.

One little this:

```diff
-                if e_up not in reachable:
-                    if splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
+                if e_up not in reachable and splitting_depth_2(e, e_up):
```
Otherwise LGTM.
