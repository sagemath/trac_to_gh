-Before this wait #22693 to get reviewed and closed.
+A maximal chain in a congruence lattice can be seen as a path of combining blocks. Let `L` be `LatticePoset( ([], [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 8], [6, 9], [7, 9], [2, 5], [3, 5], [5, 8], [8, 9]]) )`. Now `Con(L)` has two maximal chains.

+A lattice is constructible by doublings iff there is *at least one* maximal chain such that every combining combines at most two blocks to one. This is said in http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf.
+
+Now, a question: if there is **one** such maximal chain, is it true that **every** maximal chain has this same property?
+
+If that is true - and I did not found a counter-example - this function can be simplified greatly.
