While SageTeX is an awesome and useful thing, the author as of late hasn't had a lot of time for development.  SageTeX development is currently at [Github](https://github.com/dandrake/sagetex/), which is not being actively managed.  Probably it would be easier to just move SageTeX to the Sage repo, which the maintainer in personal correspondence agrees with:

> Anyway, I do think integrating SageTeX into the main Sage repo is a good idea. I know there are some pull requests there that I haven't done anything about, and if it was part of the main Sage repo, it would be easier to get those in.

So let's make this happen - or, alternately, make a fork that lives in the Sagemath organization on Github, though that probably still has an extra step to development.
