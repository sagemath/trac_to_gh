Create a file `toto.sage`:

```
raise RuntimeError("toto")
```

Now in Sage:

```
sage: load("toto.sage")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-1b599e37ac0a> in <module>()
----> 1 load("toto.sage")

/usr/local/src/sage-git/src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx in sage.structure.sage_object.load (build/cythonized/sage/structure/sage_object.c:12529)()
    999 
   1000     if sage.repl.load.is_loadable_filename(filename):
-> 1001         sage.repl.load.load(filename, globals())
   1002         return
   1003 

/usr/local/src/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/repl/load.pyc in load(filename, globals, attach)
    245             if attach:
    246                 add_attached_file(fpath)
--> 247             exec(preparse_file(open(fpath).read()) + "\n", globals)
    248     elif ext == '.spyx' or ext == '.pyx':
    249         if attach:

<string> in <module>()

RuntimeError: toto
```

This should show a traceback involving the `toto.sage` file (or at least the pre-processed version of it, see also #71). This could be implemented using some magic involving `linecache`.
