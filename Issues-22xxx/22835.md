A few comments:

- Why restrict to characteristic `0`? From the Wikipedia page, it just requires the characteristic of the field not to divide the order of the group (which you need anyways).
- You should use:
  {{{
        INPUT:

        - ``xi`` -- (default: trivial character) a linear group character of this group

        - ``return_series`` -- boolean (default: ``True``) if ``True``, then returns
          the Molien series as a power series, ``False`` as a rational function

        - ``prec`` -- integer (default: 20); power series default precision

        - ``variable`` -- string (default: ``'t'``); Variable name for the Molien series
  }}}
- I would use
  {{{#!diff
-mol = 1/self.order() * mol
+mol /= self.order()
  }}}
- You have some inconsistent spacing around the operators, and there are a number of unnecessary parentheses that (IMO) makes it harder to read.

Thanks for the comments.

For the characteristic: there are a number of problems with the Molien series entry in wikipedia, one of which is the formula for char p. While there is a formula assuming non-divisibility, I think it is somewhat more complicated that than. Dekker-deJong is the reference. I was just going to leave it for the future, but I'll take another look at their paper and see how hard it would be.
