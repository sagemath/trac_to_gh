```
From the IPython REPL launched from Sage (by running `sage --ipython` in a terminal),
we can switch off pretty printing as follows:

```
In [1]: [10**13]*5
Out[1]:
[10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000]

In [2]: %pprint
Pretty printing has been turned OFF

In [3]: [10**13]*5
Out[3]: [10000000000000, 10000000000000, 10000000000000, 10000000000000, 10000000000000]}}}
```

However, from the Sage REPL itself, or in a Sage Jupyter notebook, this does not work:

```
sage: [10^13]*5
[10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000]
sage: %pprint
Pretty printing has been turned OFF
sage: [10^13]*5
[10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000,
 10000000000000]
```

Does this come from a broken interaction with Sage's own
pretty printing features (which focus more on latexing)?

This was reported on Ask Sage twice:
