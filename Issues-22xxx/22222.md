The `_pari_instance` global in `src/sage/libs/cypari2/pari_instance.pxd` was introduced as temporary workaround. Ideally, it should not be needed.

Since many of the uses of `pari_instance` involve lists, I decided to create a new function `cdef Gen list_of_Gens_to_Gen(list s)` for fast conversion of a Python list of `Gen`s to a `Gen`. This function is in turn called from `objtogen`.
