It is optional now, but has been for almost a year and I was planning to propose to promote it to standard after the one year period.

Which it was usually happens with my libtool if there are undefined symbols when linking a shared library (is it possible you have different default settings for libtool?)

I haven't investigated further yet, but I've found a lot of automake packages don't have the necessary bits to get DLLs building properly on Windows.  See for example #21957, and I think some others I've worked on.

The attached patch should fix it.  I will add a branch with a version of this patch that *only* patches the generated files (and not the source files like configure.ac) so that applying the patch doesn't cause autotools invocation.

I also noted that even with this patch, a static library is created by default.  Unless we *specifically* want a static version of libhomfly for some reason it would be good to disable this, just for disk space savings if nothing else.
