Keywords: libhomfly cygwin

We need to upgrade libhomfly to build on Cygwin

Errors out with messages like this when trying to build the corresponding Cython file:

```

It is optional now, but has been for almost a year and I was planning to propose to promote it to standard after the one year period.

Which it was usually happens with my libtool if there are undefined symbols when linking a shared library (is it possible you have different default settings for libtool?)

I haven't investigated further yet, but I've found a lot of automake packages don't have the necessary bits to get DLLs building properly on Windows.  See for example #21957, and I think some others I've worked on.

Attachment [win32-dll.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket22856/win32-dll.patch) by @embray created at 2017-04-24 12:29:57

The attached patch should fix it.  I will add a branch with a version of this patch that *only* patches the generated files (and not the source files like configure.ac) so that applying the patch doesn't cause autotools invocation.

I also noted that even with this patch, a static library is created by default.  Unless we *specifically* want a static version of libhomfly for some reason it would be good to disable this, just for disk space savings if nothing else.

I install libhomfly as part of my usual optional packages, so that is my interest.

The library built okay for me too, but the problem (for me) comes from when you try to run `sage -b` to build the necessary Cython bindings. Did you also try this too? I also didn't change any libtool settings, so I doubt that is the problem.

Miguel, would you merge this upstream (provided it builds on your systems too)?
