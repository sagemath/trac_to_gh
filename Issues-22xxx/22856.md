It is optional now, but has been for almost a year and I was planning to propose to promote it to standard after the one year period.

So libhomfly did build for me (just ran `make libhomfly`).  Though it only built a static library, not shared, and I do have a warning:

```

[libhomfly-1.0] make[3]: Leaving directory '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/var/tmp/sage/build/libhomfly-1.0/src/lib'
```

Which it was usually happens with my libtool if there are undefined symbols when linking a shared library (is it possible you have different default settings for libtool?)

I haven't investigated further yet, but I've found a lot of automake packages don't have the necessary bits to get DLLs building properly on Windows.  See for example #21957, and I think some others I've worked on.

I install libhomfly as part of my usual optional packages, so that is my interest.

The library built okay for me too, but the problem (for me) comes from when you try to run `sage -b` to build the necessary Cython bindings. Did you also try this too? I also didn't change any libtool settings, so I doubt that is the problem.

Miguel, would you merge this upstream (provided it builds on your systems too)?

I could apply the patch upstream and make a new release (so we would need to update the libhomfly version in Sage). But I don't have a windows machine to test it on.

Another option is to just apply Eric's patch in Sage's install script.

What option do you think would be better?
