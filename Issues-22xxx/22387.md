Groebner basis algorithms don't quite work with polynomials with floating point coefficients (e.g. in RR), as this is prone to rounding errors.

Prior to Sage 7.5, it was possible to do these computations for some inputs (using the capability of Singular to compute with polynomial rings over their `real` and `complex` types(?)).

Another way to handle this would be to convert input coefficients to rationals, and then convert back.
I am not sure whether this should be done automatically.

On Sage 7.4, one also gets a similar error if the precision is too low:

```
sage: RRR=RealField(prec=10)
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(RRR, order='lex'); P
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Real Field with 15 bits of precision
sage: f=11*x^6*y-y^5*x^2+3*y+2
sage: g=x^3+y*x^2+3*y+13*x^5+2017*x^2*y^3
sage: ii=ideal(f,g)
sage: ii.groebner_basis()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
KeyError: '1.000e+00'
```

Running this example in Singular 4.1.0 directly produces the ideal (1) - which is of course nonsense (the exact answer consists of 2 polynomials, one of form `x-t(y)`
and the other `s(y)`, with degrees of `s` and `t` around 30, and huge rational coefficients).

```
> ring r = (real,10),(x,y),lp;
> poly f=11*x^6*y-y^5*x^2+3*y+2;
> poly g=x^3+y*x^2+3*y+13*x^5+2017*x^2*y^3;
> std(ideal(f,g));
_[1]=1
```

Certainly, there is in general no way to check that the result computed by Singular is correct (they could have detected a rounding error that led to this, but they don't).

Maybe just include a warning that the result is untrustworthy?
