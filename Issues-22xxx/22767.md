Try adding `from `__future__` import division` there, you will get 4 failures.

Perhaps this is bikeshedding, but I don't understand why this change

```diff
-                    r /= v.ramification_index() * v.residue_class_degree()
+                    r = r / (v.ramification_index() * v.residue_class_degree())
```
You don't need to change it back, but it just feels like it is slightly more complicated code to me.
