Something goes very wrong here:

```
sage: bring=ZZ
sage: for a in cartesian_product([[bring.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:     
Integer Ring
sage: bring=QQ
sage: for a in cartesian_product([[bring.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:     
Integer Ring
```

Hi Frederic,

Replying to [ticket:22594 chapoton]:
Actually what goes very wrong is that:

```
cartesian_product([[ZZ.one()]]) is cartesian_product([[QQ.one()]])
```
Note that if you relaunch a new sage, and ask the computation in the reverse order, you'll get:

```
sage: bring=QQ
sage: for a in cartesian_product([[bring.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:     
Rational Field
sage: bring=ZZ
sage: for a in cartesian_product([[bring.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:     
Rational Field
```
The main problem is that the construction of the `CartesianProduct` parent object is cached and Sage made the choice that `ZZ.one()` and `QQ.one()` are indistinguishable when put in a hash table. Its the same as 

```
sage: set([ZZ.one(), QQ.one()])
{1}
```
As a workaround, if you only needs the list, don't build the parent. I would then, suggest to use

```
sage: for a in cartesian_product_iterator([[ZZ.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:
Integer Ring
sage: for a in cartesian_product_iterator([[QQ.one()]]):
....:     print a[0].parent()
....:     
Rational Field
```

Cheers,

Florent

This is a very simplified example. My use case is right in the middle of somthing more complicated. This breaks my program because it triggers the coercion failure in #22591.
