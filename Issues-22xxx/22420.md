Hmm. At the beginning, I listed some tickets there, this is true. Then, after looking at the description of #20875, I thought that the tickets I put were not directly in the description.

I planned to extend this list and to limit it to new methods implementations.

No big opinion, I simply thought to make this ticket a specific meta-ticket.
