Hmm. At the beginning, I listed some tickets there, this is true. Then, after looking at the description of #20875, I thought that the tickets I put were not directly in the description.

I planned to extend this list and to limit it to new methods implementations.

No big opinion, I simply thought to make this ticket a specific meta-ticket.

Very good revival (there used to be longer release notes... centuries ago)!

I'll have a look at what Jonathan did and add a few things. Perhaps it would be worth doing it for 9.0, for the sake of completeness and encouragement for people to do it too!

Done. As before revision and/or improvements are welcome. Now the release note for 9.0 are almost only about polyhedral geometry, but at least they don't look as sad anymore. And maybe people get the idea that if there are that many changes just in polyhedral geometry than a lot of work has been done.
