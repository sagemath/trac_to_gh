The offsets applied to axes labels do not contain aspect ratio multipliers. When the aspect ratio adjustments are significant, the labels currently can get positioned far from the axes. This example

```
var('y')
plot3d(sin(x*y),(x,-10,10),(y,-1,1),viewer='threejs',aspect_ratio=[.1,1,1])
```

displays the error when zoomed out. [Live example](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?q=zufuit) to help with review.
