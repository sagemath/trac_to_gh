In SageNB speak: `text_control` without label.

The SageNB `text_control` is aliased to the `HTML` widget in Jupyter. This makes sense, except that the `HTML` has a `description` which becomes a label. This does not look right when used in interacts: it is common in SageNB to do things like

```
@interact
def foo(txt=text_control("<h1>Interact for foo</h1>"))
```
where the "Interact for foo" is displayed as a heading for the interact. You don't want "txt" to appear as label for this heading.

<a id='comment:5'></a>I was able to reproduce the problem in Jupyter ("txt" tag appears in the output). This ticket fixes this issue. I also made sure that there is no regression on the behavior of `text_control` inside the old sagenb notebook. To me this is a perfect.

Before setting this to positive review, I just want to make sure about the small regression in coverage introduced by this ticket:

```
Decreased doctests in repl/ipython_kernel/widgets.py: from 7 / 7 = 100% to 7 / 9 = 77%
```
due to the new methods:

```diff
+    @property
+    def description(self):
+        return ''
+
+    @description.setter
+    def description(self, value):
+        pass
```

I know that they are tested few lines above, but I prefer not see the coverage script tell us thousands of time that there is a coverage problem in this file. Do you accept to fix this?
