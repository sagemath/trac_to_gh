It's a standard package, so it will be built. It just won't be used by anything.

but at the minimum I think we should only allow `spkg-check` to be run on intel class hardware.

Is it really problematic?
Remember that at the moment we ship GIAC which is completely broken outside x86*...

You can still modify spkg-check to disable testing on non-x86* if you want.

You mean, just like a compiler ;)

It is true that at the moment we are borked out on ppc64 and arm64 so it doesn't matter so much I guess.
