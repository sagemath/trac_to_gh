Examples for current failures:

```
    sage: polymake.application("tropical")
    sage: p = polymake.cartesian_product(polymake("uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,2)"),
    ....:                                polymake("uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,1)"))
```
Fails because `cartesian_product` is a Sage method already.

```
    sage: polymake.application("polytope")
    sage: c = polymake.cube(3)
    sage: c.save("cube3.poly")
```
Fails because `save` is a Sage method already.

```
    sage: polymake.application("tropical")
    sage: l = polymake("uniform_linear_space<Min>(3,2)")
    sage: l.bounding_box(1)                    
```
Clashes with the polymake global function of the same name.

Docstring of `PolymakeFunctionElement::__call__`:

```
        We consider both member functions of an element and global functions
        bound to an element::

            sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3, 13, seed=12)      # optional - polymake
            sage: p.get_schedule('"VERTICES"')                    # optional - polymake  # random
            sensitivity check for VertexPerm
            cdd.convex_hull.canon: POINTED, RAYS, LINEALITY_SPACE : INPUT_RAYS
            sage: p.minkowski_sum_fukuda(p).F_VECTOR            # optional - polymake
            13 33 22
```
Is this useful at all? This seems to cause the `bounding_box` clash.
