After the fix of #22553 (which was a much needed improvement over past kludges), I'm seeing `nan`s in the JSON representation of some surfaces that were not present previously. This manifests itself in a failure to render the scene, resulting in a black screen. You can test with this plot:

```
spherical_plot3d(real(spherical_harmonic(2,1,x,y)),(x,0,pi),(y,0,2*pi),viewer='threejs')
```

JMol gets the same `nan`s passed to it but still renders this plot, so it has some work around. We can't simply ignore vertices with `nan` because that will throw off the list of faces. Having the rendering fail is not an option.

Possible solutions:

1) set `nan` to zero by default, since the ones I'm seeing are coming from arctan(0/0) around the origin, but that might not be a good overall solution

2) create a popup in the HTML asking the user to modify the input data slightly to avoid singular points

3) implement some amount of randomness in 3D plots just like in 2D plots

The first is easiest to implement. The third would take appreciable time to get right. And I really don't like the second.

A couple more options are reading some of the JMol source code:

5) detect `nan` before generating the Three.js plot and remove all bad vertices and any faces using them from the JSON representation

6) detect `nan` further upstream where the `IndexFaceSet` is generated, either in the method to produce its JSON representation or before that, and prevent any bad vertices from being added to begin with

This last one probably makes the most sense from a structural point of view, unless there is a good reason to include bad vertices in an `IndexFaceSet`. Perhaps I should ask that question on sage-devel.
