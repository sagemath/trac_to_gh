The following would be convenient:

```
sage: R.<m, n> = AsymptoticRing("m^QQ*n^QQ", ZZ)
sage: ae = 1 + 42/n + 2/n/m + O(n^-2)
sage: ae.monomial_coefficient(1/n)
42
```
The choice of the method name `monomial_coefficient` is motivated by the homonymous [method](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.html#sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_element.MPolynomial_polydict.monomial_coefficient) of multivariate polynomial rings.

Looks good; I only have very small things to discuss:

1.

```
+        - ``monomial`` -- a monomial element which can be converted
+          into the parent of this element.
```
What about rephrasing this to the following, so that the technical term "parent" is avoided

```
a monomial element which can be converted into the asymptotic ring of this element
```

2. Remove period after "element." above (convention in [SageMath](../wikis/SageMath); not used in the asymptotic_ring file much...).

3.

```
+            raise ValueError("non-exact monomial")
+            raise ValueError("not a monomial")
```
Within the asymptotic ring module usually error messages include the element (in the above, the monimial), i.e. 

```
raise ValueError('non-exact monimal {}'.format(monomial))
raise ValueError('{} not a monomial'.format(monomial))
```
(Maybe inserting "is" in the latter, but not sure.)

5. FYI, the following (undocumented) feature of a polynomial is present:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: a=(1+2*x*y+3*x^2)
sage: a[x*y]
2
sage: a[x^2]
3
```
So maybe `__getitem__` should have this behavior as well...
