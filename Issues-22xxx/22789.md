New methods `jacobian` and `jacobian_det` are implemented in the class `DiffCoordChange` managing transition maps on differentiable manifolds; they return respectively the Jacobian matrix and the Jacobian determinant of the transition map. 
Besides, the Jacobian determinant is no longer computed at each creation of a transition map, but only on demand. The computational method itself, implemented in `MultiCoordFunction.jacobian_det`, has been improved. It relies now on the standard determinant of matrices and no longer on the cofactor method. The latter was  implemented as a workaround to a bug in symbolic `charpoly` (fixed in #14403) but had a serious performance issue in high dimensions (n > 4), as reported
[here](https://sympa.obspm.fr/wws/arc/sagemanifolds.list/2017-04/msg00001.html).
