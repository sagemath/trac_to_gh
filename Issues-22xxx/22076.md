For the base class `Polynomial` and its subclasses, use `_richcmp_` instead of `_cmp_` to implement comparison.

Note that this does not include multi-variate polynomials.

I think this is incorrect:

```
sage: Pol.<x> = RBF[]
sage: Pol(1/3) == Pol(1/3)
False
sage: x/3 == x/3
True
```
If I remember correctly, there were already bugs of this kind with polynomials, but this particular example shows a regression.

False

This shows a deeper issue with the use of `richcmp_not_equal` (which appears in several places). This specific issue with `RBF` is therefore not limited to polynomials.

Therefore, I would suggest to accept this ticket as-is and then work on improving every use of `richcmp_not_equal` on a follow-up ticket. Would that be acceptable?

To me, yes.
