I'll give this a try later on, yes. I wonder whether we need to change the version number, as this only affects the build-time behavior. I'd conjecture that if the build succeeded at all, then the output should be identical with or without this patch. Not sure though.

I had the conversation about the version bump before with Jeroen Demeyer. While I agree in practice  - like in gentoo - the bump is unnecessary, the argument is that it will allow the build to tested in depth by the patchbot and anyone getting the next version of sage with it in.
