I'll give this a try later on, yes. I wonder whether we need to change the version number, as this only affects the build-time behavior. I'd conjecture that if the build succeeded at all, then the output should be identical with or without this patch. Not sure though.

Package build successfully on a system where it failed before.
Changes to files look clean.
Version bump *might* be unneccessary but certainly won't hurt.
Thanks a lot!
