```
sage: var('x', 4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3)
```

if we parse the arg by the length we get the desired behavior:

```
    if len(args)==1:
        name = args[0]
    elif len(args)==2:
        name = args[0]
        num_vars = args[1]
        if num_vars > 1:
            name = [name + str(i) for i in range(num_vars)]
    else:
        name = args
```

does it have some other undesired effects? 

with the current set of tests in `var.pyx`, it seems to pass.

Added the numeric 2nd argument, following `@`tscrim's recommendation.

Let me suggest to add functionality for handling more than one variable. Note that the behavior below is a replica of SymPy's symbols constructor, check `from sympy import symbols`.


```
It is possible to handle several variables if we pass a list of names as first argument::

    sage: var(['x', 'y'], 2)
    ((x0, x1), (y0, y1))
```

and

```
The input variable name(s) is taken as initial subindex::

sage: var(['x1', 'y2'], 2)
((x1, x2), (y2, y3))
```

What are your thoughts?

I think that's one of the reasons why this doesn't belong in the top-level `var`. I could see why people would want to have a shorthand for

```
lambda x,n: tuple(SR.symbol("%s%s"%(x,i)) for in range(n))
```
or perhaps even

```
lambda x,n,m: tuple(tuple(SR.symbol("%s%s_%s"%(x,i,j)) for j in range(m)) for i in range(n))
```
but you'd probably want to bind the result to a single symbol, say `X`, so that you can spell variables programmatically via `X[i]` or `X[i][j]`.
This is also the approach taken in

```
sage: R.<X>=InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
```
where you need to use `X[0],X[1]` etc.

In other words, generating indexed symbolic variables is probably not suitable for injection at all.

OK, it makes sense. Moreover it also answers my previous question if there is a technical reason why `var` wasn't defined to work with vectors/matrices already in Sage (.. I was comparing to Matlab's `sym('x', m, n)` command, but that one only returns the object, it does no injection).

I guess this is wontfix?

Good, i've uploaded an attempt to implement it. Feedback welcome. The behavior is now:

```
sage: x = var('x', 3)
sage: x
(x0, x1, x2)
sage: x1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-21-e8a5da2185eb> in <module>()
----> 1 x1
 
NameError: name 'x1' is not defined
``` 

BTW this is related to #11576, a summary follows. There are pointers to use cases where this notation is useful. There are also many technical hints explaining that one would prefer to exploit Ginac's indexed expressions. There are patches, the last one with a doctests failure reported in sage 5.10. 

As far as i can see, a random user would still need, currently, the convoluted `a = var(','.join('a%s'%i for i in range(4))); a`, hence comparable to `a = var('a', 4)` in terms of performance (?).

Hi,

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A14):

> 


do you mean `if hasattr(args[1], '__index__')`? 

> I also dislike the `if num_vars > 1`: why special-case `num_vars == 0` and `num_vars == 1`? There should also be a check for negative numbers like `var(x, -23)`.


this was intended for the case `var('x', 1)`, which should return i suppose `x0`. in this situation, passing a list is wrong because the command `SR.var(['x0'])` is not ok (gives `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`). so i didn't know if there is a way to bypass this issue without making the 2 cases.

with those changes, the `if` becomes:

```
    got_number = False
    if len(args)==1:
        name = args[0]
    elif len(args)==2:
        if hasattr(args[1], '__index__'):
            got_number = True
            num_vars = args[1]
            if num_vars == 1:
                name = (args[0] + '0')
            elif num_vars > 1:
                name = [args[0] + str(i) for i in range(num_vars)]
            else:
                raise ValueError("The number number of variables should be at least 1")
        else:
            name = args
    else:
        name = args
```

ok. for the `import operator` statement, in other files this is done at the script level (here, `var.pyx`), while at others it is at the function level (here, `def var`). assuming that the condition is that to be on top it should be used by more than 1 function, i've put it inside `def var`.

updated version with:

- case of 1 variable : 

```
sage: polygens(QQ, 'x', 1)    # returns a tuple
(x,)
sage: var('x', 1)    # returns a tuple, too
(x0,)
sage: var('x')    # usual, does not return a tuple
x
```

- check tuple is injected properly :

```
sage: var('z', 2)
(z0, z1)
sage: z
(z0, z1)
```

critics/corrections welcome

[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/128478/should-python-import-statements-always-be-at-the-top-of-a-module) seems pretty comprehensive and sensible.

Most imports in functions in sage are to avoid expensive imports on startup and to avoid some circular import problems with `from ... import ...` statements. I don't think that applies here, so the import should go on top.

I'm -1 on this injection and the place where this change happens. First the place:

`SR.var` is the main routine, which works side-effect free. Any API changes should be done there (and I think `SR.var('x',3)` would not get too much in the way). The top-level `var` only differs from `SR.var` in order to support binding injection.

Next the kind of injection.

With `var('z',2)` the return value is `(z0,z1)`, while the binding is to the name indicated by the string `z`. I think in most cases people who use this would want to do `z=SR.var('z',2)`, which expresses the result perfectly and also reflects how a significant number of examples in our documentation use `var` (as in `x=var('x')`). However, it is not obvious to me that people would automatically expect `var('z',2)` to have that effect. I expect that half of them would expect `z0,z1` to be bound, because that is what `var('z0,z1')` does and it has the same return value.
That's confusing.

Hence: generating variable sequences is fine, but the "right" injection behaviour here is even less clear than in a simple `var`. Starting afresh, I would not expect `var` to have its injection behaviour at all. Some magic command like `%var x` or a preprocessor construct is a much more natural syntax vehicle for it. In this case, I don't see one obvious way of extending `var`'s injection behaviour in a natural way, so I think this shouldn't be done at all.

First put it in SR.var and see what usage arises. Perhaps practical experience shows how (if at all) injection should work.

The current behavior seems OK :

```
sage: var("z", n=2)
(z0, z1)
sage: z0
z0
sage: z
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-3a710d2a84f8> in <module>
----> 1 z

NameError: name 'z' is not defined
```

Users can always do `z=var("z", n=2` if needed, but might prefer `Z=var("z", n=2` or {{{, if only for pedagogical reasons.

Furthermore, we have so far just a trick to define a bunch of symbolic variables easily, but no mathematical properties associated with this bunch.

We could want to do something like `z=vector(var("z", n=2))`, but is this really what we mean ? It seems to me that this //restricts// the possible (or at least the easy) use cases of these indexed variables, since it implies that those symbolic variables have common properties (e. g. their possible values have the same parent...).

Such an addition would be extremely tempting, however, if we could create "symbolic variables of a fixed type", which do not exist currently in Sage (e. g. there is no way to create a polynomial with, say, rational coefficients designated by names rather than values...).

As far as I know, this the same closure `("duplicate/invalid/wontfix")`...

I wouldn't say the current behaviour is "OK", but it's a fact that we already have that:

```
sage: var("z",n=2)
sage: z0,z1
```
so it's already injecting the (individual) variables. As I explained above, I expect that this is one of 3 outcomes:
- `var("z",n=2)` should bind the names of the symbols it creates, or
- `var("z",n=2)` should bind `z` to a tuple so that `z[0]` and `z[1]` are the desired symbols, or
- `var("z",n=2)` shouldn't bind anything because we don't know what to bind: the names `z0,z1` aren't explicitly mentioned, so those should be out-of-bounds, and `z` isn't really created as a symbol itself.
Personally I think: `var(...)` shouldn't support `n=...` at all because it's unclear what it should do. People should be steered to `SR.var` which forces people to perform the desired binding behaviour. That ship has sailed, though. And if people get confused by `var` then we can just say:  use `SR.var` instead.

so +1 on closing as duplicate/wontfix
