Some 9 year old code in R interface prevents it from picking up any configuration and forces PNG plotting. This was changed for a while in [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) version to implement plotting support, see
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/NUIxQcMJLjk/discussion
for some details and discussion.

Would be nice to incorporate this change into Sage, it is one of 3 little things that are still different in [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) special branch.

I am not entirely sure how to test the change. All tests pass for me and as for functionality - locally plotting works with and without, while remotely it does not work currently anyway.

I'll have a look at this, but don't hold your breath...

I'm a bit wary of "not forcing the PNG device" : this one is the default fallback for a lot of R graphics and is used (alas) by a lot of R interfaces. What do you plan to do ?

I'm also thinking of suggesting a couple of build-time dependencies for R :
* explicitly using Sage's openblas for lapack and blas.
* advising the installation of tcl/tk (used as a basic dependency in a couple of base R packages).
* similarly, advise installation of TIFF libraries (necessary for producing graphics for a few retro journals (sep. in application domains, such as medicine) which ave not yet heard of PDF or EPS files ;-).

I also plan to add, in a separate ticket, openssl as a standard package. This will cut the SSL licensing nonsense we have heard more than once recently...

Adding embray to Cc : I hear that Cygwin can be a bitch... Adding aMac OS/X user interested in R would also be a good idea. Who ?

Also, depending on #20523 seems a good idea : our curent 3.2.4-revised version is an antique...
