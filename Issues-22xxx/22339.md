Keywords: bug, doctest, days84

The test suite of `src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py` takes an infinite amount of time. 

The responsible doctest is

```
(line 1924):    TestSuite(TransitiveGroups()).run()
```
And it is blocked because of

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: elt = T.an_element()
sage: T(elt)     # hangs
```
This comes from #22382.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22576

`T.an_element()` works. What doesn't work is creating an element of T from an element of T.

The traceback after <Ctrl-c> pointed me to these lines:

```
/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/sets/disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py in _element_constructor_facade(self, el)
    575             return el
    576 
--> 577         for P in self._family:
    578             try:
    579                 return P(el)
```
sage: T._family
Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
}}}

It is an infinite family - of course it hangs.

Obvious solution: First check whether the parent of the given element belongs to the family.  But alas, the element of T has no reasonable parent at all. I get the following rather strange sequence of lines:

```
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: t.parent() in T._family

No idea how to fix that, though.

So this comes from #22382, where we actually are now doing some validity checks. So when the family of sets in the union is infinite, we get the hanging behavior when an element is not in the set. We can reverse this behavior for this case, but that is a somewhat separate issue as in this case, the actual parent of the element in question is broken.

Well, the comments were not clear either. It was not obvious to me that the "this" from [comment:8] was referring not the bug on this ticket.

OK, so we need to deal with `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` issue. As Jeroen rightly says on #22570, this cannot be done by `spkg-install`, as it updates user-specific
stuff in `~/.sage/gap/`. 

What else can be done? I only see an option of `sage` checking
on startup whether  `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` must be run.
Can we get away with only triggering it if a new Sage package was installed?
(otherwise this looks like a time-consuming check).

Docs on how to install GAP packages manually should also
indicate the need to run `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` after
a GAP package is installed or removed.

Answering my own question: yes, the following still hangs:

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: T(t)
```

Here is a fix. The issue is that `TransitiveGroups` claims to be a `Parent`, but it is not as it doesn't have proper elements. I just hacked around that by directly implementing a `__call__`. It has nothing to do with the GAP package.
