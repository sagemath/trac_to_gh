There is code in `functions/orthogonal_polys.pyx` that intends to implement different algorithms for the resp. functions. But `OrthogonalFunction.__call__()` is never called, as one can see from inserting a print statement, so you always get the Sage algorithm.

Note however that trying to override `__call__()` is inherently dirty and a solution likely depends on #17531.

Resolution: wontfix
