I propose to add two functions to the polyhedron class; namely `neighborliness` and `is_neighborly`. 

While `neighborliness` could be used to calculate the `is_neighborly`, it might be faster not to compute the neighborliness if one only wants to know `is_neighborly(k)` for some small k.  (More specifically, the output of  `P.is_neighborly()` shoud be the same as `P.neighborliness()>=floor(P.dim()/2))`).

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Moritz,

- perhaps in the "neighborliness" add a SEEALSO pointing to "is_neighborly".
- In the examples of neighborliness there are spaces missing in `P=Polyhedron` in several instances.
- In the INPUT and OUTPUT of `is_neighborly` there are backticks missing around one `k`.

More comments to come...

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi Moritz,

Here are a couple of things to correct:

- the syntax for the seealso block (in both functions) should be corrected (see [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings))
- The seealso block should be before the examples
- The first example in `is_neighborly` should be easy. Put the first example at the end.
- perhaps change the index`l` so that it is not confused with the number `1`. 

The doc compiles on 7.6.beta6
