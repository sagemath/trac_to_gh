This happens with some other graphs, too, for example `graphs.CycleGraph(2)`.  In these cases, the layout is specified in the constructor and has positions extremely close to 0:

```
sage: C2 = graphs.CycleGraph(2)
sage: C2.get_pos()
{0: (6.123233995736766e-17, 1.0), 1: (-1.8369701987210297e-16, -1.0)}
C2.show()
```

If you manually set positions close to zero, the same phenomenon of invisible lines appears:

```
h = Graph([(0,1)])
h.set_pos({0:(1e-3, 1), 1:(-1e-3,-1)})
h.show()
```

The same thing happens if the line is very nearly horizontal.

but not quite, line...

```

These methods should use method `_circular_embedding` from file `graph_plot.py`, and we should put in it the corrections that we did in #24512 for `CycleGraph`.
Note that I have recently corrected method `_line_embedding` in #25403.

The embedding of the `CircularLadderGraph` could be simplified to:

```
from sage.graphs.graph_plot import _circle_embedding
_circle_embedding(G, list(range(n)), radius=1)
_circle_embedding(G, list(range(n, 2*n)), radius=2)
```

The error in `graphs.CircularLadderGraph(1)` is due to methods `add_cycle` and `add_path` that do not check if the input list of vertices are empty, of length 1, etc.

`@`dima: I searched ticket and discovered that `_line_embedding` was introduced in #12980 and `_circle_embedding` in #12942 while `layout_circular` was here before #7004... So you are fully right.

`@`Jeroen: no, I have not investigated matplotlib yet. We should do it, but I'm no expert in matplotlib. Also, the I have not checked the `tikz` part yet, but without this patch you can see that there is a problem with the position of the vertices in `_latex_` (values of x and y in `\Vertex` lines).

```
sage: print(graphs.CompleteGraph(2)._latex_())
\begin{tikzpicture}
\definecolor{cv0}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}
\definecolor{cfv0}{rgb}{1.0,1.0,1.0}
\definecolor{clv0}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}
\definecolor{cv1}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}
\definecolor{cfv1}{rgb}{1.0,1.0,1.0}
\definecolor{clv1}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}
\definecolor{cv0v1}{rgb}{0.0,0.0,0.0}
%
\Vertex[style={minimum size=1.0cm,draw=cv0,fill=cfv0,text=clv0,shape=circle},LabelOut=false,L=\hbox{$0$},x=5.0cm,y=5.0cm]{v0}
\Vertex[style={minimum size=1.0cm,draw=cv1,fill=cfv1,text=clv1,shape=circle},LabelOut=false,L=\hbox{$1$},x=0.0cm,y=0.0cm]{v1}
%
\Edge[lw=0.1cm,style={color=cv0v1,},](v0)(v1)
%
\end{tikzpicture}
```
With this patch, the positions are the following, so vertical.

```
\Vertex[style={minimum size=1.0cm,draw=cv0,fill=cfv0,text=clv0,shape=circle},LabelOut=false,L=\hbox{$0$},x=2.5cm,y=5.0cm]{v0}
\Vertex[style={minimum size=1.0cm,draw=cv1,fill=cfv1,text=clv1,shape=circle},LabelOut=false,L=\hbox{$1$},x=2.5cm,y=0.0cm]{v1}
```


I will try to make `_circle_embedding` a method of `GenericGraph` and unify with `layout_circular`. It's better if such embedding is done in a single place.

I don't now how tikz pictures are done. I'd be surprised if they are produced via matplotlib. If they are produced in some other way I guess it's not matplotlib's bug, it's Sage one. 
But where I don't know---too many layers of classes etc for me :-)

I'm also unable to guess what's going on with `plot`/`show`. Way to complicated for me.


In `GraphLatex`, the method `tkz_picture` computes `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax` positions, and then the positions of the vertices are scaled to fill the specified image size (5*5 by default).

When `xmin == xmax`, then vertices are placed at the middle of the x range, so by default 2.5.

But when we have `G._pos = {0: (6.123233995736766e-17, 1.0), 1: (-1.8369701987210297e-16, -1.0)}`, `xmax - xmin = 2.4492935982947064e-16` and so the vertices are spread in the x axis. Vertex 0 will be at `(5.0, 1.0)` and vertex 1 at `(0.0, -1.0)`.

So I think that the `round(cos(...), 10)` is needed.


Question: some code is duplicated in `tkz_picture` (certainly a copy/paste error). Should I open a new ticket to remove it or can I do it here ?
