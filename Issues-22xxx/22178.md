```diff
+    If your system supports multiprocessing and you want to use multiple

+
+    [user@localhost sage]$ make -jNUM
```
The current recommendation seems to be to use 

```
    export MAKE="make -jNUM"
    make
```
instead. See discussion in #21610.

indeed, as indicated in #21610, one can get away with toplevel `make -jNUM`, but
only after some work, and assuming `make`'s version is at least 4.2.1.

I run `make -j10` all the time on OS X Sierra (`make` version 3.81) without doing anything else and have no apparent problems. Does that just mean that the process falls back to a single job for parts of the build, like the documentation?

With plain `make -j10` documentation takes 1284 seconds to build, with `export` it takes 1155 seconds. Not enough of a difference for me to stop using the simpler command.

My bad, documentation build apparently somehow gets hold of '-j10'---you could see this
by looking at 'top' output and observing about 10 python processes running.

What would matter is building of Sage packages - each of them would be built with '-j1'.

> On one machine, when I built with `MAKE='make -j6'`, `make build` took 99 minutes. With `MAKE` unset, `make -j6 build` took 107 minutes.

I did `make distclean` followed by `make -j8` on an 8-core Linux machine
I got, with `MAKE` set to `make -j8`

```
real    41m35.245s
user    259m17.166s
sys     13m55.563s
```
and with `MAKE` unset (don't forget to actually run `unset MAKE` before trying)

```
real    55m40.123s
user    219m20.552s
sys     13m30.681s
```
which is almost 30% slowdown (w.r.t. the wall clock).

- Some of your line breaks make some lines unnaturally short to me.

The more important of the two is the first one.

I know this ticket is already on positive review, but I'd like to suggest to change it to
