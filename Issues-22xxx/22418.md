With #21539, Sage globally supports a `V=0` mode. In this mode, the individual logfiles are created with `V=1`. But this leads to surprising behaviour because some packages have `V=0` by default. So a build with `V=0` can actually be *more verbose* than a build with `V` unset.

Instead, always unconditionally use `V=1` for individual packages.

This looks fine; but I just noticed that (with or without this ticket) this works for `V=0 make` but not for `make V=0` because in the latter case `MAKEFLAGS` is set to `V=0` and can't be overridden by the environment variable.

That is a different issue which is unrelated to this ticket.
