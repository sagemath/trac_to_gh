With #21539, Sage globally supports a `V=0` mode. In this mode, the individual logfiles are created with `V=1`. But this leads to surprising behaviour because some packages have `V=0` by default. So a build with `V=0` can actually be *more verbose* than a build with `V` unset.

Instead, always unconditionally use `V=1` for individual packages.
