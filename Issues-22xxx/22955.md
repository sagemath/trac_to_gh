`MatrixSpace` has a basis, so we should put it into the category of `ModulesWithBasis`. We also use `dict` as `monomial_coefficients` with the extra keyword `copy` (default `True`) and change the `basis` to return a `Family`.

In order to introduce a deprecation and have a fixed list order, we need to pass the `keys` attribute to `FamilyWithHiddenIndices` and up to its base classes.

The Runtime Type Checking to distinguish vectors from matrices is somewhat smelly but I don't see a better way. And it's very nice to finally have matrix spaces as finite dimensional modules. So let it be.

I am assuming the patchbot will go green after your latest fixes. Therefore positive review!

I agree. There might be some better ways by checking dimensions or number of entries. However, it wasn't clear what was the best way forward and this kept the old behavior. We can always change it on a followup.
