`MatrixSpace` has a basis, so we should put it into the category of `ModulesWithBasis`. We also use `dict` as `monomial_coefficients` with the extra keyword `copy` (default `True`) and change the `basis` to return a `Family`.

In order to introduce a deprecation and have a fixed list order, we need to pass the `keys` attribute to `FamilyWithHiddenIndices` and up to its base classes.

Really the only reason I make these changes is so the print order is fixed. I feel this is a natural change. I don't think I am quite following what you are saying about the API.

Do you have any chance to have someone cross check the russian / japanese? Otherwise, up to the above comment, and assuming all tests pass, I believe this is good to go.

If you wait until July, then I can get someone to look at the Japanese when I am in Japan. Although I am fairly confident about the translation, and we can always make additional changes later.

However, we currently have 1 failing doctest in `categories/covariant_functorial_construction.py` that I do not know if we need to simply change the output or change the test.

Thanks Travis!

The Runtime Type Checking to distinguish vectors from matrices is somewhat smelly but I don't see a better way. And it's very nice to finally have matrix spaces as finite dimensional modules. So let it be.

I am assuming the patchbot will go green after your latest fixes. Therefore positive review!

I agree. There might be some better ways by checking dimensions or number of entries. However, it wasn't clear what was the best way forward and this kept the old behavior. We can always change it on a followup.
