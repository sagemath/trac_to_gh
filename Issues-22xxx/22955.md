`MatrixSpace` has a basis, so we should put it into the category of `ModulesWithBasis`. We also use `dict` as `monomial_coefficients` with the extra keyword `copy` (default `True`) and change the `basis` to return a `Family`.

In order to introduce a deprecation and have a fixed list order, we need to pass the `keys` attribute to `FamilyWithHiddenIndices` and up to its base classes.

Altogether it looks good. And it's very nice to have `MatrixSpaces` get finally closer from proper ModulesWithBasis`. Thanks Travis!

I still need to double check on the changes in `Family`.

One additional question: rather than loading more categories upon startup, would we have a chance to avoid creating a matrix space upon Sage startup? That's what we would want in the long run.

This has been something I have wanted for a long time too with some use cases.

Really the only reason I make these changes is so the print order is fixed. I feel this is a natural change. I don't think I am quite following what you are saying about the API.

Ok, after reading in detail the Family changes, that's actually how I would have done it myself; all good! I added a test. It would have been best done in a separate ticket, but let's move on.

About the changes in `*tour_linalg`, we have a slight problem: the change in the example would require to update the comment just above which says that `basis` returns a list. No big deal in itself, but we need to change that in a bunch of languages; I could take care of the german, french, and english versions; maybe you can handle one or two more.

About the change in the `french_book` directory: changes there require a discussion with the book authors, to make sure the book is kept in sync. I discussed with myself, so that's done :-)

If you wait until July, then I can get someone to look at the Japanese when I am in Japan. Although I am fairly confident about the translation, and we can always make additional changes later.

However, we currently have 1 failing doctest in `categories/covariant_functorial_construction.py` that I do not know if we need to simply change the output or change the test.

Thanks Travis!

The Runtime Type Checking to distinguish vectors from matrices is somewhat smelly but I don't see a better way. And it's very nice to finally have matrix spaces as finite dimensional modules. So let it be.

I am assuming the patchbot will go green after your latest fixes. Therefore positive review!

I agree. There might be some better ways by checking dimensions or number of entries. However, it wasn't clear what was the best way forward and this kept the old behavior. We can always change it on a followup.

Patchbot came back (essentially) green, and I didn't notice a problem with the pdf doc.
