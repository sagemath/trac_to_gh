Something that happened to me with those tests as well is that I got a more verbose output the first time

```
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/misc/latex.py", line 2157, in sage.misc.latex.?
Failed example:
    view(4, margin=5, debug=True)
Expected:
    \documentclass{article}
    ...
    \usepackage[tightpage,active]{preview}
    \PreviewEnvironment{page}
    \setlength\PreviewBorder{5.000000mm}
    \begin{document}\begin{page}$4$\end{page}
    \end{document}
    ...
Got:
    This is XeTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-0.99991 (TeX Live 2014) (preloaded format=xelatex)
     restricted \write18 enabled.
    entering extended mode
    LaTeX2e <2014/05/01>
    Babel <3.9l> and hyphenation patterns for 48 languages loaded.
...
```
It ends up being a super set of the expected output. I didn't get it when running the test remotely. I will have to check if you need to be on the machine to see that.

OK, in any case the change is rather trivial. I don't like seeing windows poping up either in the middle of what I am doing because doctests are running in the background. Which is exactly what happened to me this afternoon.

Can you fill in the author section please.
