Still doesn't work. I also have a large offset in my configure patching:

```

Here is the last part of the log:

The offsets aren't a big deal--I think it's just because of different versions of autoconf used to generate the original file versus the patch.

The fact that it's still not working for you could come down to granularity of mtimes still being too low such that the files look like they were modified simultaneously.  Maybe this should just include the patch to configure and not to configure.ac, or at the very least touch configure before running it.
