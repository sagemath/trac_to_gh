I regenerated some of the patches we maintain for R, from a repository based on R 3.3.3, the current version in Sage since #20523.  So the new patches should apply more cleanly.  I also updated a few of the patches slightly:

* Updated `hardcoded_dirs.patch` so that it only takes action if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is actually set.  Otherwise it would set an invalid `$R_HOME_DIR`.  This was confusing for testing the validity of the patch set outside the context of Sage.

* The original `m4_macro_bug.patch` only patched the m4 script, but did not update the `configure` script with the resulting changes.

* The patches for Cygwin were not being applied (see [[#22627 comment:13](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22627#comment:13)]).  This fixes that, but also reworks the original `cygwin.patch` in such a way that it doesn't break building on other platforms.  Instead of trying to make a DLL import lib (`libR.dll.a`) this relies on the fact that [direct linking](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Using_ld_the_GNU_Linker/win32.html) (see under "direct linking to a dll") to `libR.dll` was already working.  And in fact trying to use the import lib *didn't* work immediately without patching rpy2.

The reason it wasn't working seems to be some undocumented (that I can find) subtlety with symbol resolution in `ld` when direct linking to a DLL versus using an import lib.  For some reason it's less fussy about `-l` flag order when using direct linking.  At any case, not using an import lib for R works in this case and simplifies the patches needed for Cygwin support.

This fixes building R 3.3.3 on Cygwin.

Depends on #22627

Looks like the Cygwin aspect of this still needs work, as building rpy2 demonstrates for me.  I'm not sure libR.dll is being installed in the correct place.

Nevermind, this seems to have more to do with rpy2 I think.
