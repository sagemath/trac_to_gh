I regenerated some of the patches we maintain for R, from a repository based on R 3.3.3, the current version in Sage since #20523.  So the new patches should apply more cleanly.  I also updated a few of the patches slightly:

* Updated `hardcoded_dirs.patch` so that it only takes action if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is actually set.  Otherwise it would set an invalid `$R_HOME_DIR`.  This was confusing for testing the validity of the patch set outside the context of Sage.

* The original `m4_macro_bug.patch` only patched the m4 script, but did not update the `configure` script with the resulting changes.

* The patches for Cygwin were not being applied (see [comment:13:ticket:22627]).  This fixes that, but also reworks the original `cygwin.patch` in such a way that it doesn't break building on other platforms.  Instead of trying to make a DLL import lib (`libR.dll.a`) this relies on the fact that [direct linking](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Using_ld_the_GNU_Linker/win32.html) (see under "direct linking to a dll") to `libR.dll` was already working.  And in fact trying to use the import lib *didn't* work immediately without patching rpy2.

The reason it wasn't working seems to be some undocumented (that I can find) subtlety with symbol resolution in `ld` when direct linking to a DLL versus using an import lib.  For some reason it's less fussy about `-l` flag order when using direct linking.  At any case, not using an import lib for R works in this case and simplifies the patches needed for Cygwin support.

This fixes building R 3.3.3 on Cygwin.

Looks like the Cygwin aspect of this still needs work, as building rpy2 demonstrates for me.  I'm not sure libR.dll is being installed in the correct place.
