The k-split basis of the subspace of symmetric functions is defined using the Hall-Littlewood creation operators.  If `lambda = mu + nu` where `lambda`, `mu` and `nu` are lists representing `k` bounded partitions and `mu` has largest hook equal to `k`, then `ksplit(nu).hl_creation_operator(mu) == ksplit(lambda)`.

This ticket implements the ksplit functions as a basis of the `kBoundedSubspace`.  It is accessed from the symmetric functions either by

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'].fraction_field()).kBoundedSubspace(3).ksplit()
3-bounded Symmetric Functions over Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field in the 3-split basis
```
or by the shortcut

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['t'].fraction_field()).ksplit(3)
```
In either case, the value of `t` is specified as an optional argument whenever `k` is specified and the default value of this argument is `'t'` which needs to be an element of the ring if it is not specified.

A few minor changes are made to the other `kBoundedSubspace` bases (addition of a shortcut to access `k` and `t` in the basis, a minor change in the full name of the k-Schur basis to make it more consistent).
