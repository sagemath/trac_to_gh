}
```

This

```
        c = cmp(self.ambient_dim(), other.ambient_dim())
        if c != 0: return c
```
and this

```
        if self.ambient_dim() != other.ambient_dim():
            return False
```
are not equivalent.

And this is also dubious:

```
        if self._Vrepresentation is None or other._Vrepresentation is None:
            return False   # make sure deleted polyhedra are not used in cache
```
I wonder if an exception would be better here.

I have added the doctest you wanted.

For the raise message in case of None, I do no know the meaning of this line. I was tempted to just remove all that, but Jeroen did not agree. I think this is not worse than before, which was returning an arbitrary result.
