I am coming back to this and I think more generally this bit of `sage-env` is not helpful:

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/cpp" ]; then
    CPP=cpp
fi
```
This will overrides what autotools default to, which is `$CC -E` (or `$CXX -E` if the current language is C++) and only if that's not working `cpp`. This can have a slightly different behavior especially if include folder and macros are passed with `CFLAGS` rather than `CPPFLAGS`, which is very very common.

Ultimately when I first ran the test my set up would pick some `cpp` instead of `clang -E` and that lead me to the observed failure. I would need some more of the log before inferring why you get 3 failures without #12426. Since `curl` has no dependencies we cannot blame another package not being built using `clang`.

Given access to computers running various versions of macOS,
how would one investigate whether this issue still exists?

This is actually fixed as a side effect of the work I have done in support of clang. Normally `./sage -f -c $pkg_name` would rebuild and trigger the spkg test suite if it exists.

But this ticket is now a duplicate I believe. That's the best way to describe it.

It was not a clang problem per see. It was sage-env insisting on defining CPP instead of letting `configure` use `$CC -E` all by itself.
