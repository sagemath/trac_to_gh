Seen in 7.6beta4 :

`SAGE_BROWSER=chromium sage -n jupyter` opens the Jupyter notebook in Firefox (my default browser) whereas `SAGE_BROWSER=chromium sage -n` opens in Chromium.

I've checked that, when my default browser is Chromium, the problem is the same (i. e. `sage -n` honors SAGE_BROWSER, whereas `sage -n Jupyter` opens the default browser).

Not serious, but annoying...

It works as intended. Nice diagnosis...

What do you mean ? Should we replace SAGE_BROWSER by BROWSER (i. e. following the system default) ? Or passing BROWSER=$SAGE_BROWSER to Jupyter ? The latter makes sens to me, the former a bit less...

Here is a slight complication on OS X. To run a browser, there does not seem to be a direct command from the terminal; instead, you need to run something like `open -a Firefox`. With the old-style notebook,

```
BROWSER="open -a Firefox" sage -n
```
works, but with the Jupyter notebook, you have to use

```
BROWSER="open -a Firefox %s" sage -n jupyter
```
If you omit the `%s`, nothing happens: the browser does not open a window or tab. Note also that if you include the `%s` with the old style notebook, it gives an error: "The file /Users/jpalmier/.sage/%s does not exist."

So I have not yet found a single syntax that works for changing the browser with both old and new style notebooks.

It seems that `webbrowser` allows two syntaxes for `BROWSER`:

1. If it contains `%s`, it is split into a command-line using `shlex.split()`.

2. If it does not contains `%s`, it must be a single command (so indeed `open -a Firefox` wouldn't work).

Instead, SageNB just runs `$SAGE_BROWSER $URL` without caring what `$SAGE_BROWSER` is.

Dunno yet : just `make`ing. Seems to need to recompile a couple of packages. On my machine, `make` + `make ptestlong` is about 2-3 hours (depending on whether I need to `make distclean` or not. Often, but not always). Stay tuned...

BTW, merging your branch updated a *lot* of things in mine. What in hell were you on the top of ?

Okay. I was on 7.6.beta4. I understand.

But that means that your branch includes the beta4==>beta5 upgrade. I was surprised by this. And I'm surprised tha Jeroen didn't "tutt, tutt" at this.

`make ptestlong` running. Probably needs 100-120 minutes (no guarantees...).

On Debian testing :
* Solves my initial complaint.
* On top of 7.6.beta5, passes `ptestlong` with the usual :

```
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
which passes standalone.

==> `positive_review`, subject to verification by someone able to test it on other platforms (OS/X is done, as far as I understand, but I'm thinking of Cygwin, for which the environment problem is *quite* different).

I suggest paging Erik Bray, if you have its address...
