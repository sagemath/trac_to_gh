A follow up to #22391. My original problem was too slow computation of zero via

```python
Delta3 = LatticePolytope([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (-1,-4,-6)])
sum(len(e.interior_points()) * len(e.dual().interior_points()) for e in Delta3.edges())
```
Sage 7.6.beta4 gives
- timeit: 5 loops, best of 3: 1.73 s per loop
- profiler: 71844 function calls (71620 primitive calls) in 1.841 seconds
With #22391
- timeit: 5 loops, best of 3: 451 ms per loop
- profiler: 46502 function calls (46434 primitive calls) in 0.570 seconds
With this one
- timeit: 25 loops, best of 3: 11.3 ms per loop
- profiler: 7793 function calls (7747 primitive calls) in 0.031 seconds

As a less contrived example, it now takes 0.41s to get `ReflexivePolytopes(3)` (cached afterwards) instead of 7.61s. Part of the speed up is due to omitting some precomputation, but it is possible to do so because of speed up on demand.

Next goal is not to rely on PALP for computing points of standalone polytopes at all, although for large sets of polytopes it still may be the fastest option.

Depends on #22391
Depends on #22400

Sure, but in toric geometry especially related to mirror symmetry it is important to handle very simple cases fast (e.g. all reflexive polytopes have precisely one interior lattice point, the origin).

Of course, it would be nice to handle all cases efficiently, and to be able to choose new methods appropriately I tried to first optimize existing one as much as possible, in particular not to take too much time just to convert data between different types.

Thanks for taking a look!

I think an even faster way than

```python
n = N.zero_vector()
for i, coef in enumerate(c.coefficients()):
    n[i] = coef
n.set_immutable()
normals.append(n)
```
would be

```python
n = N.element_class(N, c.coefficients(), coerce=False, copy=False)
n.set_immutable()
```
(although perhaps the coerce and copy are unnecessary). In general, if you know your input is good, you can bypass the extra overhead of `__call__` and `_element_constructor_` (there are a few places where you can do this I believe).

Also, it might be better to do

```diff
-                points = list(p.vertices())
-                for j in range(nv, m.ncols()):
-                    current = M.zero_vector()
-                    for i in range(M.rank()):
-                        current[i] = m[i, j]
-                    current.set_immutable()
-                    points.append(current)
+                points = list(p.vertices()) + m.columns(copy=False)
                 p._points = PointCollection(points, M)
```
Although I have not checked if the columns are longer than `M.rank()`.

Otherwise LGTM.
