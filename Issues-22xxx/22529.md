with Sage 7.5.1:

```
sage: reset()
sage: quit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/localdisk/tmp/sage-7.5.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/all_cmdline.pyc in <module>()
----> 1 quit

NameError: name 'quit' is not defined
```
I believe reset() should restore exactly the initial state when starting Sage, including the `quit` function.

Maybe use `%reset -s`, or `%reset -s -f` to skip the confirmation. The command `%reset_selective REGEXP` will reset any names matching `REGEXP`:

```
sage: a = 3
sage: a2 = 5
sage: %whos
Variable   Type       Data/Info
-------------------------------
a          Integer    3
a2         Integer    5
sage: %reset_selective a
Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])?  y
sage: %whos
Interactive namespace is empty.

sage: a = 3
sage: a2 = 5
sage: %reset_selective -f ^a$
sage: %whos
Variable   Type       Data/Info
-------------------------------
a2         Integer    5

I don't see that these are set anywhere, even from notebook imports. What about `__DIR__`? I can't find it either.
