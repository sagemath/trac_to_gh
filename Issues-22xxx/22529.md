with Sage 7.5.1:

```
sage: reset()
sage: quit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/localdisk/tmp/sage-7.5.1/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/all_cmdline.pyc in <module>()
----> 1 quit

NameError: name 'quit' is not defined
```
I believe reset() should restore exactly the initial state when starting Sage, including the `quit` function.

Component: **user interface**

I don't see that these are set anywhere, even from notebook imports. What about `__DIR__`? I can't find it either.
