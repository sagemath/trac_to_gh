You don't have to. You could keep using `operator.div` in Python 2. I would prefer the code to be something like

```
try:
    from operator import div, idiv
except ImportError:
    pass
```

Please revert the change to lazy import, it conflicts with #22755.

```
Return a / b when __future__.division is in effect. This is also known as “true” division.
```
Does this mean that we need `from __future__ import division` everywhere, or is the single import in sage.all enough?

Regarding the change

```diff
         cdef long j
         cdef long prec
 
-        if op not in (operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.div):
+        if op not in (operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul, operator.truediv):
             raise ValueError("op must be operator.OP where OP=add, sub, mul or div")
 
         if not isinstance(p2, Polynomial):
```
in sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx, the docstring needs to be changed, too:

```
        - ``op`` -- ``operator.OP`` where ``OP=add`` or ``sub`` or ``mul`` or
          ``div``.
```
Also the string in the error message: "op must be ... or *truediv*".

<a id='comment:13'></a>* in python3, div does no longer exist

* in python2, the behaviour of truediv is the same as in python3

* the future import transforms the behaviour of div and / in python2 to become the same as truediv

The strategy here is very simple : get rid of any use of div everywhere, and use truediv instead. This works smoothly, as the bot has been green already.

This does not fix completely the division issue, as we may have later to add the future import in some files that use /. This has already been partially done.

You need to interpret it "Return `a/b` as if `__future__.division` is in effect" (I agree that the documentation is a bit confusing). It does true division regardless of any future imports. Analogously, `operator.div` does old-style division regardless of any futute imports.

<a id='comment:16'></a>1. `src/sage/ext/fast_callable.pyx`: I guess you should support both `div` and `truediv` (instead of only `truediv`).

10. `src/sage/structure/element.pyx`: this is really wrong: `from operator import truediv as div`. "truediv" and "div" are distinct operators which should be handled separately.

I don't really understand the symbolic stuff, so I cannot really check it well. On the other hard, there is probably no reason for symbolics to treat "div" differently from "truediv".
