<a id='comment:17'></a>To answer the questions above:

1. `from __future__ import unicode_literals` is like changing all strings in the sources from `"foo"` to `u"foo"`.

2. Cython does understand `str`, `bytes`, `unicode`, `basestring` in all Python versions.

Note that this conflicts with #22755.
