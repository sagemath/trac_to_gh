The current eclib version in Sage (as of 7.5.beta5) is v20160720.

**New tarball**: http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170104.tar.bz2

Of relevance to Sage are a bugfix and some extra functionality related to modular symbols, see #10256 and #21046.

If you look here: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commits/master, specifically at the commits made in January this year, you will see that the code now works (at least it is supposed to) with or without NTL_ALL being set.  This is controlled by the --enable-mpfp flag to ./configure.  That was quite a lot of work since there were quite a lot of tests whose output was trivially different with/without that option set.

Note that the default configurations is to have --enable-mpfp set and hence NTL_ALL set, you have to turn it off using --disable-mpfp.  Since Sage's spkg-install does not turn it off, it is on in Sage.

So I think the only thing I did not do is update and close that Issue.  Sorry!

Exactly. This is about compiling Sage library files (Cython extensions) against `libec`.

> And that must be crucial given that the compiled code must then link to the library libec!  So I now think that we must continue to set NTL_ALL in this cython file, otherwise there will be errors which including eclib's header files.

The `NTL_ALL` macro should be considered an implementation detail of `eclib` and it should not influence other software built against `eclib`.

But this is a minor point which won't influence this Sage ticket.

Another version will appear shortly.  For the record: the sign of plus modular symbols was being set correctly when L(E,1) is nonzero but not otherwise (random) and the sign of the minus symbol was not being set at all.  Now both are dealt with.

The new tarball is in place, and I will update the branch soon.

I suggest that when this has yet again had a review by Jeroen, we do not set it to positive review until Chris is happy over at #10256.
