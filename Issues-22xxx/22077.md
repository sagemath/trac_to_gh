The current eclib version in Sage (as of 7.5.beta5) is v20160720.

**New tarball**: http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170104.tar.bz2

Of relevance to Sage are a bugfix and some extra functionality related to modular symbols, see #10256 and #21046.

If you look here: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/commits/master, specifically at the commits made in January this year, you will see that the code now works (at least it is supposed to) with or without NTL_ALL being set.  This is controlled by the --enable-mpfp flag to ./configure.  That was quite a lot of work since there were quite a lot of tests whose output was trivially different with/without that option set.

Note that the default configurations is to have --enable-mpfp set and hence NTL_ALL set, you have to turn it off using --disable-mpfp.  Since Sage's spkg-install does not turn it off, it is on in Sage.

So I think the only thing I did not do is update and close that Issue.  Sorry!

Exactly. This is about compiling Sage library files (Cython extensions) against `libec`.
