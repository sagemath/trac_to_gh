See my initial mention of the issue [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/timeline?from=2017-04-18T13%3A18%3A47Z&precision=second) and the upstream bug report to pynac:

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/244

This is probably not a bug with Sage itself but I figured I would make a ticket for it in case anyone else encounters this issue.
