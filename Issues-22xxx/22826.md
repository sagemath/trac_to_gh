See my initial mention of the issue [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/timeline?from=2017-04-18T13%3A18%3A47Z&precision=second) and the upstream bug report to pynac:

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/244

This is probably not a bug with Sage itself but I figured I would make a ticket for it in case anyone else encounters this issue.

Depends on #22838

**Keywords:** singular pynac

**Branch/Commit:** [e3a64836e8cf1caffaa2285610c229149799170f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/e3a64836e8cf1caffaa2285610c229149799170f)

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
