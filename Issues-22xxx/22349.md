Why does `Graph.vertices()` need to *sort* the list of vertices? If the user wants a sorted list, they can always call `sorted()` anyway. The same for `Graph.edges()`.

Sorting is broken badly now that #22029 is merged.

What you propose to do is not an easy task. I suspect that many algorithms assume that the vertices are sorted. For sure, many algorithms assume that the ordering is always the same when calling `vertices()` and `vertex_iterator()`, so I hope that what you propose preserves this strong assumption.

Is your long term plan to remove parameter `sort` from the methods or just to set its default value to false ?
I don't know the potential problems of sorting with Python 3, so I'm not sure of the motivation.

Many many tests are broken

I never claimed that it was easy. But it has to be done in order to support Python 3.

> For sure, many algorithms assume that the ordering is always the same when calling `vertices()` and `vertex_iterator()`, so I hope that what you propose preserves this strong assumption.

It should remain the same, yes.

> Is your long term plan to remove parameter `sort` from the methods or just to set its default value to false ?

I don't care much. I guess once the default is `False`, there will be little reason left to keep the `sort` keyword.

> I don't know the potential problems of sorting with Python 3, so I'm not sure of the motivation.

The problem is that you cannot sort arbitrary things in Python 3. For example:

```
>>> sorted([1, "hello"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unorderable types: str() < int()
```

As far as I understand, there are at least two different issues here:
* some algorithms want a consistent and easy to test order on the vertices, typically (but probably not only) to loop over the unordered pairs of vertices normalized by putting the smalled vertex first;
* in interactive use, when there is a natural order on the vertices (in practice, mostly when they are integers, strings, or possibly nested tuples of such things), *people* want to see the vertices, edges, etc. listed in an order that makes the output easy to read, and it would be a significant regression to take that away from them.

one way is

>>> sorted( ..., key=str )

You could of course use another key function that uses some sorting heuristic (something like the key function used by https://pypi.python.org/pypi/natsort)

Display functions in IPython have hooks for nice sorting (used for dicts and sets), so if graphs need to display their keys and edges in a nice way, that's probably the hook to go for.

Algorithms that need their edges sorted should either insist on sortable labels or sort by index tuples or something like that (something that is guaranteed to be sortable regardless of what the user decides to use as labels).

So what can we do ?

The only good news here is that vertices must be immutable.

There are 3 different points here: 1) sorting the list of vertices, 2) sorting the list of edges, and 3) sorting the vertices of an edge.

For 1), we made huge progresses in reducing the dependency of methods to `.vertices()`. I'm not sure how many methods still rely on it. Most of them now use the ordering given by  `list(G)` without making specific assumption on that order. We create a mapping when needed, and pass it to some methods. We can certainly completely avoid that dependency, but can we do that without deprecation ? 

For 2), similarly, we have reduced the number of methods relying on `.edges()`, plus we can use `sort=False` parameter. We can try and see...

3) is more tricky and I don't know how to do that yet.

Actually, #27408 has silently (not mentioned in the ticket) introduced a deprecation warning for sorting edges by default, but it is used in method `.edges(...)` only when `sort is None` and the default value of `sort` is `True`. So I think no-one is aware of it.

I'm not sure how to make this deprecation warning visible without breaking numerous doctests.

The difficulty is that we still have some methods relying on `.vertices()`, and I don't know how to avoid that.

For instance in `graph.py`: `effective_resistance_matrix`, `common_neighbors_matrix`, `orientations` (but this one can be avoided easily), `chromatic_quasisymmetric_function`, `twograph`, `write_to_eps`. And there might be other modules using graphs and relying on the ordering of the vertices given by `.vertices()` (e.g., `combinat`, `geometry`, `groups`, `matroids`, `schemes`, `topology`, etc..

The `.vertices()` method is probably used lots of times, but one fix could be:

- every time it's used, add the argument `sort=False` or `sort=True` as necessary,
- and then change the default to `sort=False`.

Maybe it's easier with edges: add the explicit argument everywhere and then change the default to `None`.

Or is that too naïve? I tried this change:

The best I can think of right now is:

- Make the default `sort=None` and raise a deprecation warning if this default gets used, thereby requiring an explicit argument everywhere in the Sage library.

- So use `sort=False` or `sort=True` as appropriate in the library.

Then later we can change the default to `sort=False`.

I did a few changes in graphs and many tests. I have not detected any problem yet, but others may raise some issues.

This ticket highlights many places were the usage of graphs must be improved. I did some (minor) corrections in `src/sage/schemes/curves/zariski_vankampen.py` as example, but more can be done in this file.
Typically, it is better to use `for u in G:` than `for u in G.vertices(sort=False):`. The ordering of the vertices is the same, but we avoid building the list of vertices. Tests like `u in G.vertices(sort=False)` should be replaced by `u in G`. etc.
In future tickets, we should address (very bad) code like this in `src/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/library.py`

```diff
-        for e in G.edges():
-            i = G.vertices().index(e[0])
-            j = G.vertices().index(e[1])
+        for e in G.edges(sort=True):
+            i = G.vertices(sort=True).index(e[0])
+            j = G.vertices(sort=True).index(e[1])
```
Clearly, we need to define a mapping from vertices to index.
