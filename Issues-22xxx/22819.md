I introduced here `__eq__` and `__ne__` in the class `HyperbolicModel`. This is probably not needed, just a side effect of my lazyness to undo what I did. Do you mean that I should remove them ? If yes, I agree.

The most important part of the ticket is the change of behaviour for hyperbolic points. Here I really think that one needs `_richcmp_`
