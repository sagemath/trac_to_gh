Introduced on #22152:

```sage
sage: Pol = ZZ['x']['y']['z']
....: d = Pol.gens_dict_recursive()
....: x, y, z = d['x'], d['y'], d['z']
....: v = QQ(0)
....: (x*z)(x=v)
```
In the special degree cases, there is an assumption that `pol` has the same degree as `self`. This example shows this may not be the case (in the above, it gets reduced to degree 0).
