Whenever `__len__()` makes no sense on some object, `__len__()` should `raise TypeError`.

Some classes currently `raise NotImplementedError`, which is not meant for this.

I would like to work on this issue. I looked up for some .pyx and .py files which contain __len()__ out of which lazy_string.pyx and mrange.py look like the ones to be fixed. However I could not find any function where __len()__ raises a NotImplementedError , mrange.py already raises a TypeError when the object size is not finite.

I didn't look very well, but there is at least also `src/sage/rings/ring.pyx`

Yea, this looks good. I don't find any of the __len__() functions raising NotImplementedError in misc component. Anyway, I will fix the function in ring.pyx.
