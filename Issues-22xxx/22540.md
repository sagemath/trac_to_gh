Move `src/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref/data_structures_*.pxi` to a proper Python module `src.sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.data_structures`.

In detail (inside the directory `src/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref`):

1. Move everything from `data_structures_pxd.pxi` to `data_structures.pxd`

2. Move most inline functions from `data_structures_pyx.pxi` to `data_structures.pxd`

3. Move everything else from `data_structures_pyx.pxi` to `data_structures.pxd`

4. Change return types of `cdef` functions not returning anything to `void`.

5. Remove `&` before functions passed as a pointer (this is not needed for ordinary functions and wrong for function pointers).

This also fixes many compiler warnings when compiling these modules.
