Some minor updates to the installation guide:

- We require a system-wide Python to install Sage, and the installation guide is not clear about this.

- The capitalization of `LaTeX` is not consistent.

- The directory `src/ext/texlive` does not exist, so we should remove references to it.

- Atlas is not a standard package any more, so issues with installing it are not "common problems". So I've deleted that section.
