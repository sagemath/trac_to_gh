    If you want to create a new directory in the Sage library SAGE_ROOT/src/sage (say, measure_theory), that directory should contain a file __init__.py that contains the single line import all in addition to whatever files you want to add (say, borel_measure.py and banach_tarski.py), and also a file all.py listing imports from that directory that are important enough to be in the Sage’s global namespace at startup. The file all.py might look like this:

But as the docu also says something about `lazy_import`, which is not used here, I'm confused, whats the correct way to do here.

<a id='comment:15'></a>tscrim: I changed the imports accordingly.
Regarding the `__init__.py`, this means there should also be no `import all`? IDK how this global namespace is generated and if this import is necessary for this. If you vote for removing the crypto stuff from the global namespace or this is not needed for this, I can also remove these imports.
