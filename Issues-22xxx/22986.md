perhaps for all crypto things a `crypto` catalog should be itroduced, and this can go there then.

There are still errors:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --warn-long 58.4 src/sage/repl/interpreter.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 58.4 src/sage/repl/ipython_tests.py  # 4 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 58.4 src/sage/repl/interface_magic.py  # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```
but I think these are not due to my changes to the SBox module..
Is this correct?
