BTW, Maxima can give back some "interesting" results:

```
sage: from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_product
sage: symbolic_product(1+(-1)^(x+1)/x,x,1,oo)            
...
ValueError: power::eval(): pow(1, Infinity) is not defined.

Found a small oversight in latex functions for Function_sum and Function_prod :

```
sage: latex(sum(sin(X(j)),j,1,p))
{\sum_{j=1}^{p} sin(X(j))}
```
whereas what is sought is something along the lines of `{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \sin\left(X\left(j\right)\right)`}

Patch suggestion :

```

Yet another note :

`sum()` expands its first argument. I'm not sure that this is pertinent. Compare :

```
sage: sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2,j,1,p)
sum(X(j)^2 + 2*X(j)*Y(j) + Y(j)^2, j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum(((X(j)+Y(j))^2),j,1,p)").sage()
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p)
```

I have implemented (in a private branch), an "expand" option controlling if `distribute()` should expand its first argument (default) or not (might come in handy in some situations). This allows :

```
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute()
sum(X(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(2*X(j)*Y(j), j, 1, p) + sum(Y(j)^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
sage: maxima("sum((X(j)+Y(j))^2+Z(j),j,1,p)").sage().distribute(expand=False)
sum((X(j) + Y(j))^2, j, 1, p) + sum(Z(j), j, 1, p)
```

But this currently works only from sum expressions cast from Maxima ; Sage-built sums get expanded //volens nolens//, as seen above, and the resulting expansions can't be factorized back by `factor()`.

Possible solution : an "expand" keyword argument to sum (default=True) controlling the expansion ? What do you think ?

The same goes, of course, for products.

Indeed : giac is now standard...

Indeed.

But I'm not so sure : the Mathematica interface has other (serious) problems, that can be triggered also in sums and products. This, IMHO, is a distinct problem, and should be fixed by someone knowing what it does with Mathematica (I don't...). 

Is it reasonable do document a (good) way to use a (flaky) interface ? I let you judge...

done. for `mathematica` unfortunately i also don't have it so cannot test, but i do think it's good to mention as a valid option.

i'm having an issue with the `hold` option:

```
sage: k, n = var('k, n')
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_product(k, k, 1, n)
factorial(n)
sage: sage.calculus.calculus.symbolic_product(k, k, 1, n, hold=True)

/Users/forets/sage-src/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/calculus/calculus.pyc in symbolic_product(expression, v, a, b, algorithm, hold)
    868
    869     if hold == True:

    871         return sprod(expression, v, a, b)
    872

```

let me fix it by changing `symbolic_prod` to `symbolic_product` in line 870
