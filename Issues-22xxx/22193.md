We already have `src/sage/libs/pari/tests.py`. That would be a good place to put those tests.

It's been extremely painful, but I've manually gone through all docstrings. As Jeroen suspected, very few of them were Sage-specific, but most of them needed to be de-Saged.

I moved the few Sage-specific tests to `test.py`, and also duplicated there some tests that could have been done entirely in CyPari2, but that used to activate some code-paths in Sage that wouldn't be activated otherwise.

There's two notable bits of docstring I haven't touched yet:

1. The "Guide to real precision" in the module docstring of `pari_instance.pyx`. This is very Sage-specific, and it's more than just a testsuite. Where shall we move it?

2. The `Gen.sage()`, which of course has no place in CyPari. Did we decide anything on subclassing `Gen`, though?

For the rest, I hopefully changed all `^` to `**` at the right spots, and removed all dependencies on Sage (except for the `sage:` prompt and the import statements). If I forgot something, we will notice anyway when setting up tests outside of Sage. I also fear that some doctests may fail in Python3, but that should also be easy to fix.

In my doctest trip, I saw a lot of very archaic code, esp. in the number field and the elliptic curve methods. For example `nfbasis` has a very weird docstring, and takes a flag parameter that seems to be undocumented in PARI.

The code for `src/sage/libs/cypari2` will be removed from Sage anyway, so I don't consider it a problem that the doc is not in Sage anymore.

However, the doc for `src/sage/libs/pari` should remain in Sage. It is currently not.

<a id='comment:23'></a>
Some details...

1. You forgot to remove one `int()` here:

```
sage: int(2) ** pari(-5)
```

2. Why did you remove this?

```
sage: bnr = pari("K = bnfinit(x^4 - 4*x^2 + 1); bnrinit(K, 2*x)")
sage: bnr.nf_get_pol()
```

3. This sentence is no longer relevant:

```
However, beware that ``pari(L)`` returns an absolute number field::
```

4. This is a significant change:

```
-            sage: two = RealField(256)(2)._pari_()
+            sage: two = pari(2)
```
Instead, you could use

```
two = pari("2.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
```

5. This is confusing since the `5/3` is not the fraction 5/3 in Python!

```
sage: pari([-1, 5/3, -8.0]).vecmin()
```
You could keep the original test with quotes: `pari("[1, -5/3, 8.0]").vecmin()`

This breaks in Sage, unless we positive review #22321. But I wanted to explore that ticket a bit more before setting it to needs review.

On the other hand, it doesn't hurt Python.

I did not remove it. I changed it to

```
sage: x = pari('x')                                                                                                         
sage: K = (x**4 - 4*x**2 + 1).nfinit()
sage: K.nf_get_pol()                                                                                                        
```

which seems to be functionally equivalent and more concise. However, you know PARI better than me. If you think that's more appropriate, I can change it to
 
```
sage: x = pari('x')                                                                                                         
sage: K = (x**4 - 4*x**2 + 1).bnfinit().bnrinit(2*x)

But the `bnrinit()` call is gone, so it's clearly a different test.

Why not keep the original test? It should work as written in CyPari2.

Because examples in the documentation should show the proper way to do things, not the ugly one.

I admit I do not understand the reason for the call to `bnrinit()`, maybe you can elucidate.

We can put the old test in `TESTS::`, however, if you wish to keep it.

It shows that `nf_get_pol()` works when given a bnr (the output of `bnrinit()`) as input. So it is an important test which really should not be removed.

The original documentation said

```
In the third case, the precision is determined only by the inexact
inputs and the ``precision`` argument is ignored::
                                                  
    sage: pari(1.0).sin(precision=180).sage()
    0.841470984807896507
    sage: pari(1.0).sin(precision=40).sage()
    0.841470984807896507
    sage: pari(RealField(100).one()).sin().sage()
    0.84147098480789650665250232163029899962
```

which has no equivalent in CyPari. Would you find this clearer?

```
    sage: d = pari(float(1.0)).sin(precision=180); d
    0.8414709848078965067
    sage: d.bitprecision()                                 
    64
```

However this test is also architecture dependent.

Replying to [defeo](#comment%3A40):

I disagree with this.

There are plenty of ways to create high-precision numbers in CyPari:

```
sage: n = pari("1.0000000000000000000000000000"); n.bitprecision()
128
sage: n = pari("localbitprec(100); 1.0"); n.bitprecision()
128
sage: n = pari(1.0).bitprecision(100); n.bitprecision()
128
```

Personally, I would prefer the third way.

So I think that you can mostly keep the old doctests, just replacing `pari(RealField(100)(1.0))` by `pari(1.0).bitprecision(100)`.

There's pretty much nothing that can be salvaged from this section: precision in PARI is in multiples of 32 or 64. That's it.

> and all of "Output precision for printing" should be kept for CyPari2.


I think this section is completely misleading, and the more I try to understand, the less I get it. It talks about "printing" precision, `set_real_precision` seems to affect more than printing:

```
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(1000)
sage: a = pari('Pi')
sage: 
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(10)
sage: b = pari('Pi')
sage: a - b
-2.17 E-19
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(1000)
sage: a - b
-2.168404344971008868 E-19
sage: a - b.bitprecision(1000)
-5.016557612668332023557327080330757013833665769218359371379100137196517465788293201785191348671769335290615539044941776827464059187151888254971589729806147889444035537705104506961803557118902433406655387152435176621321683472879809085435143307653965138954567335178660639273975085872627541300 E-20
```

I think this whole part needs to be rewritten, not translated from the old docs. Problem is, I'm not sure I understand what it does.

How does PARI decide what bits to add when calling `bitprecision()`? Why does `Pi` have junk digits before all the zeros, while `1.0` gets only added zeros?

That's probably asking too much from PARI, but I got bad habits from Sage :)

The same behavior from `pari.pi()` surprises me much less: when I see a function call, I understand that's a function supposed to compute π up to a fixed precision.

Anyway, not much we can do here: that's the way PARI it is.

I understand that's the SOLE role of `set_real_precision`: controlling output precision. Then, when I go further down, I discover that it also controls input precision for strings.

I would find it clearer, if it was stated right away that `set_real_precision` controls input and output precision for strings.

It just adds zero bits.

You should not make any conclusions from the *decimal* representation of the number, in binary it's just zeros.

> Then, there's the fact that I expect (too optimistically) `Pi` to be a *symbolic* quantity, i.e. that incrementing precision (with `pi.bitprecision(1000)`) would compute correctly the new digits instead of adding random junk.


PARI doesn't really do symbolic computations. `Pi` does a computation returning a floating-point approximation of π.

> The same behavior from `pari.pi()` surprises me much less: when I see a function call, I understand that's a function supposed to compute π up to a fixed precision.


Actually, `Pi` is a function call. This works:

```
gp> Pi()
%1 = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028842
```
It's just that the GP parser turns `Pi` into `Pi()` to improve user-friendliness.

Right. So I think 

```
n = pari(1.0).bitprecision(100)
```

is giving bad advice to the user: it only gets the intended value by chance, and the doctstring of `bitprecision` does nothing to help the user guess what the result would be.

> It's just that the GP parser turns `Pi` into `Pi()` to improve user-friendliness.


I call this user-hateness.

Sorry for the delay. It is clearer now, thanks for the patch.

Are you sure the doctests pass on 32-bits? This, for example:

```
sage: c = pari(1).sin(); c
0.841470984807897
sage: c.bitprecision()
64
