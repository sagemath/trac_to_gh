The code for `src/sage/libs/cypari2` will be removed from Sage anyway, so I don't consider it a problem that the doc is not in Sage anymore.

However, the doc for `src/sage/libs/pari` should remain in Sage. It is currently not.

2. Why did you remove this?

```
sage: bnr = pari("K = bnfinit(x^4 - 4*x^2 + 1); bnrinit(K, 2*x)")
sage: bnr.nf_get_pol()
```

3. This sentence is no longer relevant:

```
However, beware that ``pari(L)`` returns an absolute number field::
```

4. This is a significant change:

```
-            sage: two = RealField(256)(2)._pari_()
+            sage: two = pari(2)
```
Instead, you could use

```
two = pari("2.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000")
```

5. This is confusing since the `5/3` is not the fraction 5/3 in Python!

```
sage: pari([-1, 5/3, -8.0]).vecmin()
```
You could keep the original test with quotes: `pari("[1, -5/3, 8.0]").vecmin()`

This breaks in Sage, unless we positive review #22321. But I wanted to explore that ticket a bit more before setting it to needs review.

On the other hand, it doesn't hurt Python.

I did not remove it. I changed it to

```
sage: x = pari('x')

sage: K.nf_get_pol()

But the `bnrinit()` call is gone, so it's clearly a different test.

Why not keep the original test? It should work as written in CyPari2.

Because examples in the documentation should show the proper way to do things, not the ugly one.

I admit I do not understand the reason for the call to `bnrinit()`, maybe you can elucidate.

We can put the old test in `TESTS::`, however, if you wish to keep it.

The original documentation said

```
In the third case, the precision is determined only by the inexact
inputs and the ``precision`` argument is ignored::
                                                  
    sage: pari(1.0).sin(precision=180).sage()
    0.841470984807896507
    sage: pari(1.0).sin(precision=40).sage()
    0.841470984807896507
    sage: pari(RealField(100).one()).sin().sage()
    0.84147098480789650665250232163029899962
```

which has no equivalent in CyPari. Would you find this clearer?

```
    sage: d = pari(float(1.0)).sin(precision=180); d
    0.8414709848078965067
    sage: d.bitprecision()                                 
    64
```

However this test is also architecture dependent.

I disagree with this.

There are plenty of ways to create high-precision numbers in CyPari:

```
sage: n = pari("1.0000000000000000000000000000"); n.bitprecision()
128
sage: n = pari("localbitprec(100); 1.0"); n.bitprecision()
128
sage: n = pari(1.0).bitprecision(100); n.bitprecision()
128
```

Personally, I would prefer the third way.

So I think that you can mostly keep the old doctests, just replacing `pari(RealField(100)(1.0))` by `pari(1.0).bitprecision(100)`.

There's pretty much nothing that can be salvaged from this section: precision in PARI is in multiples of 32 or 64. That's it.

> and all of "Output precision for printing" should be kept for CyPari2.


I think this section is completely misleading, and the more I try to understand, the less I get it. It talks about "printing" precision, `set_real_precision` seems to affect more than printing:

```
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(1000)
sage: a = pari('Pi')
sage: 
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(10)
sage: b = pari('Pi')
sage: a - b
-2.17 E-19
sage: pari.set_real_precision_bits(1000)
sage: a - b
-2.168404344971008868 E-19
sage: a - b.bitprecision(1000)
-5.016557612668332023557327080330757013833665769218359371379100137196517465788293201785191348671769335290615539044941776827464059187151888254971589729806147889444035537705104506961803557118902433406655387152435176621321683472879809085435143307653965138954567335178660639273975085872627541300 E-20
```

I think this whole part needs to be rewritten, not translated from the old docs. Problem is, I'm not sure I understand what it does.

The same behavior from `pari.pi()` surprises me much less: when I see a function call, I understand that's a function supposed to compute π up to a fixed precision.

I understand that's the SOLE role of `set_real_precision`: controlling output precision. Then, when I go further down, I discover that it also controls input precision for strings.

It just adds zero bits.

You should not make any conclusions from the *decimal* representation of the number, in binary it's just zeros.

Replying to [comment:49 defeo]:
> Then, there's the fact that I expect (too optimistically) `Pi` to be a *symbolic* quantity, i.e. that incrementing precision (with `pi.bitprecision(1000)`) would compute correctly the new digits instead of adding random junk.


PARI doesn't really do symbolic computations. `Pi` does a computation returning a floating-point approximation of π.

> The same behavior from `pari.pi()` surprises me much less: when I see a function call, I understand that's a function supposed to compute π up to a fixed precision.


Actually, `Pi` is a function call. This works:

```
gp> Pi()
%1 = 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028842
```
It's just that the GP parser turns `Pi` into `Pi()` to improve user-friendliness.

Right. So I think 

```
n = pari(1.0).bitprecision(100)
```

is giving bad advice to the user: it only gets the intended value by chance, and the doctstring of `bitprecision` does nothing to help the user guess what the result would be.

> It's just that the GP parser turns `Pi` into `Pi()` to improve user-friendliness.


I call this user-hateness.
