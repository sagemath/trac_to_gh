More info about it:

The rule-based integrator Rubi by Albert D. Rich consists of about 10,000 pattern-matching rules and "dramatically out-performs Maple and Mathematica" see

* http://www.apmaths.uwo.ca/~arich/

The rules are available as of 2017 only as Mathematica code. There were efforts by the SymPy community to either translate them manually or on the fly to Python:

* https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/7749

Rubi was proposed as a GSoC project for Sage:

Huh, I never heard of this!  Very interesting.  If this could be "integrated" into Pynac or Sage that would be impressive - many have proposed a Risch or other algorithm implementation in Sage (including one person who claimed their student had one, but then never followed up).

Interesting comment in the Sympy thread:

I think SymPy now has the lead on this, and we just want to include that code with Sage. I'm changing the ticket description accordingly.

This depends on a SymPy upgrade ticket.

> This depends on a SymPy upgrade ticket.

In #26550, SageMath upgraded to SymPy 1.3 where rubi support is improved.

For remaining issues in SymPy see

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.
