This ticket is part 1 of 2.  When running Larsen's algorithm over fields of degree 5 or more, E.reducible_primes() takes for ever for at least two reasons: (1) computation of the Galois closure; (2) arithmetic over that closure.  I have an improvement which avoids working in the closure at all, using instead some polynomial utilities based on resultants.

On this ticket I will add the polynomial utilities and the improved version of the function `_supersingular_reducible_primes`.

On a second ticket I will add an implementation of a different method, due to Bilieray, for finding the reducible primes.

The first two commits add some methods for univariate polynomials, not specific to elliptic curves.  The third rewrites the code in the _semistable_reducible_primes() function.  My intention is to leave the algorithm essentially unchanged while making it possible to run over fields where the Galois closure is large -- in the new version it is not necessary to compute the Galois closure at all.

If it would be helpful, I could provide a longer explanation of what I changed and why this is equivalent to the old version, but the fact that no doctests needed changing is a good sign!  I could add an example over a degree 5 field with Galois group S5, which is now possible (and quite fast).
