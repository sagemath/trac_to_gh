```
In rst, block of code are written as:


```
sage: def plop():
....:     return 'plop'
```


Currently, `sage -sws2rst` will output the old-style:

```
sage: def plop():
...       return 'plop'
```

This causes issues with other parsers. The culprit is in sagenb, `sagenb/misc/worksheet2rst.py` which is maintained in github.

I think instead of insulting the author, it would be better to try to find a solution.

If the development of the sage notebook is not part of sage development any longer, then the notebook developers should of course be made aware of the proposed fix. And since the notebook development takes place on a seemingly problematic platform then at least the notebook developers should provide a different way of communicating the fix to them.

so I  am mad and work on a problematic platform?

please, really, I have enough cockroaches in my own head to take care of...

some people who are privileged to have fixed jobs have much too much time on their hands to partake in crackpot theories, that's all I can say.
