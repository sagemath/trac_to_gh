This ticket is a quick follow-up of #22898.

The implementation of `has_perfect_matching` in #22898 is very inneficient, since it relies on a brute force search of all possible matchings until it finds one (can take an exponential time).

Try with, e.g.:

```
sage: R = graphs.RandomBipartite(1000, 1000, 1/100)
sage: R.has_perfect_matching()
```

Edmonds algorithm finds a maximal matching in polynomial time, then it suffices to check whether it has |V|/2 edges. LP solvers are pretty fast too.

The straightforward one : put binary variables on the edges, and for each vertex, the sum of the edges incident to it is 1, no objective. I just implemented it, and it is significantly faster than the one using the `matching` method, let me add it to avoid a new ticket.

<a id='comment:8'></a>The proposed LP is roughly the same (no weight, no minimization, just feasibility), but its focused so interesting.

Cplex is usually very fast to say that the problem is unfeasible, but Cplex remains a mystery and it's not easy to say which instance is the best.

<a id='comment:10'></a>The LP formulations look similar, but the polytopes are very different (in particular, the LP_matching one is kind of "relaxed" and always has integer points). I am not specialist at all, but there might be some theoretical results on which shapes are better handled by which solver strategies (perhaps Matthias can tell more about this).

Here, the best strategy seems to depend on the solver (i do not have Cplex installed):

<a id='comment:11'></a>Some corrections:
1. add test for trivial case: `if self.order() % 2: return False`
2. don't use `p.add_constraint(sum([b[e] for e in edges]) == 1)` but `p.add_constraint(p.sum(b[e] for e in edges) == 1)`, so `p.sum` instead of `sum` and no `[..]`
3. after `sage: all(G.has_perfect_matching(algorithm=algo) for algo in ['Edmonds', 'LP_matching', 'LP'])` you must add `True`

Concerning the default method, it seems that the "LP" method is in average slightly faster.

```
def pm_time(n, p, nbr):
    algorithms = ["Edmonds", "LP_matching", "LP"]
    time = {algo:list() for algo in algorithms}
    for i in range(nbr):
        G = graphs.RandomGNP(n, p)
        for algo in algorithms:
            t = walltime()
            _ = G.has_perfect_matching(algorithm=algo)
            time[algo].append(walltime() -t)
    return {algo:mean(time[algo]) for algo in algorithms}
```

Thanks for the corrections. Regarding the second one, i removed the `[..]`, so that this is more readeable than both other possibilities. I do not see the benefit in calling `p.sum` instead `sum` since MILP can handle that.

Well, this is with the commercial software CPLEX, which we can not assume to be installed on the user's machine. With `cbc` (which is not installed by default), Edomonds is faster for the dense graphs:

<a id='comment:24'></a>I've added a small PEP8 reviewer patch, please cross-review the changes.
In particular, I've rewritten the lambda expression to a function (PEP8) and have also rewritten the if-statement; if you're unhappy with the if-rewriting, then feel free to change it back.

Apart from PEP8, this patch looks good and clearly is a positive review from my side. Thank you for your work.
