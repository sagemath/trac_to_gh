Sorina Ionica, Elisa Lorenzo Garcia and I implemented the computation of Shioda invariants for a given hyperelliptic curve of genus 3.

Following the implementation of the constructors of genus 2 curves over various fields we have added the corresponding classes for genus 3 hyperelliptic curves.

some remarks:

* remove the commented code if it is useless

* reference [Sh] should go the master reference file (see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#sage-s-master-bibliography-file)

* compile the html doc and look at it to check that it looks correct

* you could use "lazy import" for your new modules.

In the current branch `shioda_invariants` **is** first of all a function in `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/invariants.py`. Of course this function should not be part of the global namespace.

> Making methods and functions for a specific genus into general ones has been done before, not only for `igusa_clebsch_invariants` but also for `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants`. This is another globally exported function, which assumes the invariants in question to be the Igusa-Clebsch invariants.

The same applies to the function `Mestre_conic`, which also exists for more general hyperelliptic curves. I find this confusing. Perhaps these functions can later be generalized with some kind of keyword argument that gives the genus or the set of invariants in question, with appropriate defaults so as not to break reverse compatibility.

So leaving aside what happens with `igusa_clebsch_invariants` and `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and its generalization, this seems to be the suggestion for the new code for Shioda invariants:

* At the least we create a function `shioda_invariants` in invariants.py that can later be found and used via a suitable import statement.
* Optionally, we create a separate genus 3 class and make `shioda_invariants` into a method for that class. But part of your point is that this is not the way to go since then the number of classes used will tend to infinity with time.

Personally I agree in that if we can do with a generic class only then that is what should happen. There is probably no possibility to store the genus on construction and tab-complete only those methods that apply for that genus? That would be optimal, but perhaps it is perverse and/or impossible to have the instance define the available methods.

Here are some impressions of the global structure. This goes beyond the present ticket but I mention it anyway. Let X be a curve with Jacobian J. First some things that     seem strange:

* The Kummer surface, which is in the global namespace, does not actually return anything and at present calls like `KummerSurface(J)` and `J.kummer_surface()`, and `X.kummer_morphism` fail.

* All invariant functions are usual imports, but `shioda_invariants` is a lazy one. Why?

Here are some suggestions for change in various directions:

* I quite like the global export of `monsky_washnitzer`, which is not a function but a module, so essentially a bunch of functions bundled up. Would it be an idea to    have similar modules called `curve_invariants` and `curve_reconstruction`? This prevents the global namespace from being filled with the names of various            alternative invariants, while still keeping these functions available.

* The question is of course how bad it is to export to the global namespace... this module is not the only one that does this. I would personally say that functions that    are naturally methods should only be methods, and that functions that do not fit this mold, like `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants`, should become global functions,   whether in a container like `curve-reconstruction` or not.

* As suggested by Vincent, we could remove the methods specific to a genus and have them be general ones. In the end I am also convinced that this does lead to better       maintenance. The only problem is that there are lots of invariants. Here is a suggestion to avoid making these all into individual methods for general hyperelliptic curves.

Personally I think few people will care about tab-completing invariants though, and if we at least mention the   available invariants in the documentation of `invariants` this should probably be OK.

The suggested changes do cause backward compatibility problems, mainly because of the functions that are currently available locally. If this cannot be changed, then at     least one can generalize `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and `Mestre_conic` later by having the current version as a default.

There is probably no possibility to store the genus on construction and tab-complete only those methods that apply for that genus? That would be optimal, but perhaps it is perverse and/or impossible to have the instance define the available methods.


In Python, you can create classes dynamically. That might be a solution.

Alternatively, we could modify `HyperellipticCurve` to accept a keyword argument specifying the invariants.


Another way that is sometimes used in Python/Sage is to have explicit class functions for creating objects from a given datatype

```
sage: MyObject.from_equation(x^2 + 1)
sage: MyObject.from_igusa_invariant("aa9b302")
```
That has the advantage of not complicating too much the `__init__` constructor.

I agree. In detail:

* I'm sorry for putting `Mestre_conic` in the global namespace, it fits much better in a module.

* Letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword is better than having a separate function. I created the separate function `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` in order to make it consistent with `EllipticCurve_from_j`, but since we may be getting more-and-more of these, I agree with letting go of the consistency.

* The name "`reconstruction`" might be a bit generic. However, there already is a module called `invariant_theory` where this may fit.

Related to this discussion:

What really happens when constructing a hyperelliptic curve of genus `g` (in characteristic different from 2) from the invariants is that a binary form of degree `2g+2` is reconstructed from its invariants. Reconstructing binary forms from invariants is useful also outside of hyperelliptic curves and also for odd degree. Degree 6 is currently in the `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` function. Degree 5 is #25508. Degree 8 is #22173.

I think it would be good to have all the (binary and ternary) form reconstructions in the same place, and as this reconstruction for odd degree is unrelated to hyperelliptic curves, it should not be implemented inside the hyperelliptic curve functions. It fits much better in/around `sage/rings/invariant_theory.py`. So I think the first step is to move the degree 6 code to the better location, and then implement the code for degree 5 and 8 there too. The code can then of course be wrapped by letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword.

I'm cc-ing the author of #25508 who may have already started working on such a move.

Thank you all for your feedback. I finally found the time to deal with this! In #27633 there is a proposal for the issue with the design of classes, and I have updated the branch of this one to follow that method.

I agree that a general `invariants` method would be good, but that should be a topic for another ticket.
