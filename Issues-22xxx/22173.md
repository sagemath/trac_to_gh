Sorina Ionica, Elisa Lorenzo Garcia and I implemented the computation of Shioda invariants for a given hyperelliptic curve of genus 3.

Following the implementation of the constructors of genus 2 curves over various fields we have added the corresponding classes for genus 3 hyperelliptic curves.

Depends on #26462
Depends on #27633

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:23\" align=\"right\">comment:23</div>\n\nI recall this ticket applying correctly before. It must have something to do with its age. I also recall that it returned the correct Shioda invariants. It is therefore a pity that it has not been incorporated in any form, since it is a worthwhile contribution.\n\nThe code is now there and certainly it can still be incorporated in some way. The question is how exactly, a question that is related to the general design of hyperelliptic curve classes. What complicates things is that before the authors' contributions can be incorporated, this needs to be decided on.

I recall this ticket applying correctly before. It must have something to do with its age. I also recall that it returned the correct Shioda invariants. It is therefore a pity that it has not been incorporated in any form, since it is a worthwhile contribution.

The code is now there and certainly it can still be incorporated in some way. The question is how exactly, a question that is related to the general design of hyperelliptic curve classes. What complicates things is that before the authors' contributions can be incorporated, this needs to be decided on. Here are some thoughts; note I do not know if they are useful since I am not the biggest expert on Sage.

As for the new class creation, it strikes me as odd that what was all right in genus 2 should be problematic in genus 3. The authors had truly taken care to follow previous practice in the former genus to the letter. That is not a bad thing, rather the opposite in fact.

As for genus 3 curves being special or not, consider what there is in genus 2: a zoo of different invariants and the Kummer. That was enough for a new class. I agree with that, but then what is the content of "special enough"? In my opinion, genus 3 hyperelliptic curves are interesting enough to merit their own class if genus 2 curves are. Think of their Prym varieties and isogenies of small degree with plane quartics, for example.

The suggestion to have `shioda_invariants` be a generic method of hyperelliptic curves means that `igusa_clebsch_invariants` should be one too. It is not, so again the authors have followed established practice. A decision of this kind would also cause the number of invariants of a generic hyperelliptic curve to grow as new invariants in higher genus are discovered.

In my opinion, it is better to expand the number of classes in small genus than to burden either the general hyperelliptic curve class or the global namespace with lots of functions.

Making methods and functions for a specific genus into general ones has been done before, not only for `igusa_clebsch_invariants` but also for `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants`.

In the current branch `shioda_invariants` **is** first of all a function in `sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/invariants.py`. Of course this function should not be part of the global namespace.

This also makes sense.

So leaving aside what happens with `igusa_clebsch_invariants` and `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and its generalization, this seems to be the suggestion for the new code for Shioda invariants:

* At the least we create a function `shioda_invariants` in invariants.py that can later be found and used via a suitable import statement.
* Optionally, we create a separate genus 3 class and make `shioda_invariants` into a method for that class. But part of your point is that this is not the way to go since then the number of classes used will tend to infinity with time.

Personally I agree in that if we can do with a generic class only then that is what should happen. There is probably no possibility to store the genus on construction and tab-complete only those methods that apply for that genus? That would be optimal, but perhaps it is perverse and/or impossible to have the instance define the available methods.

Here are some impressions of the global structure. This goes beyond the present ticket but I mention it anyway. Let X be a curve with Jacobian J. First some things that     seem strange:

* The Kummer surface, which is in the global namespace, does not actually return anything and at present calls like `KummerSurface(J)` and `J.kummer_surface()`, and `X.kummer_morphism` fail.

* All invariant functions are usual imports, but `shioda_invariants` is a lazy one. Why?

Here are some suggestions for change in various directions:

* I quite like the global export of `monsky_washnitzer`, which is not a function but a module, so essentially a bunch of functions bundled up. Would it be an idea to    have similar modules called `curve_invariants` and `curve_reconstruction`? This prevents the global namespace from being filled with the names of various            alternative invariants, while still keeping these functions available.

* The question is of course how bad it is to export to the global namespace... this module is not the only one that does this. I would personally say that functions that    are naturally methods should only be methods, and that functions that do not fit this mold, like `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants`, should become global functions,   whether in a container like `curve-reconstruction` or not.

* As suggested by Vincent, we could remove the methods specific to a genus and have them be general ones. In the end I am also convinced that this does lead to better       maintenance. The only problem is that there are lots of invariants. Here is a suggestion to avoid making these all into individual methods for general hyperelliptic curves. We could make a method `invariants` that depending on the curve chooses a particular set of invariants (perhaps Igusa-Clebsch in genus 2 and Shioda in genus 3, to be    shown in the docstring). Giving a string to invariants allows the selection of other invariants, with an error message if no invariants corresponding to the string exist or if the genus does not match up. We could mention the various invariants in the docstring of the method `invariants`, while writing more documentation in the module      `invariants` (which could become the global `curve_invariants`).

* The previous suggestion leads to the loss of tab completion. An alternative is to have an attribute `invariants` that is itself a class and that can be tab-completed  further to give the various individual invariant functions. Personally I think few people will care about tab-completing invariants though, and if we at least mention the   available invariants in the documentation of `invariants` this should probably be OK.

The suggested changes do cause backward compatibility problems, mainly because of the functions that are currently available locally. If this cannot be changed, then at     least one can generalize `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and `Mestre_conic` later by having the current version as a default.

The additions of the authors are not really in conflict, but Git cannot automerge because it does not find a common ancestor.

In Python, you can create classes dynamically. That might be a solution.

Another way that is sometimes used in Python/Sage is to have explicit class functions for creating objects from a given datatype

```
sage: MyObject.from_equation(x^2 + 1)
sage: MyObject.from_igusa_invariant("aa9b302")
```
That has the advantage of not complicating too much the `__init__` constructor.

> The second would be the extension of `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` and `Mestre_conic` to higher genus, perhaps as methods in a more general module called `reconstruction`, because these functions arguably clutter the global namespace. Alternatively, we could modify `HyperellipticCurve` to accept a keyword argument specifying the invariants.

I agree. In detail:

* I'm sorry for putting `Mestre_conic` in the global namespace, it fits much better in a module.

* Letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword is better than having a separate function. I created the separate function `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` in order to make it consistent with `EllipticCurve_from_j`, but since we may be getting more-and-more of these, I agree with letting go of the consistency.

* The name "`reconstruction`" might be a bit generic. However, there already is a module called `invariant_theory` where this may fit.

Related to this discussion:

What really happens when constructing a hyperelliptic curve of genus `g` (in characteristic different from 2) from the invariants is that a binary form of degree `2g+2` is reconstructed from its invariants. Reconstructing binary forms from invariants is useful also outside of hyperelliptic curves and also for odd degree. Degree 6 is currently in the `HyperellipticCurve_from_invariants` function. Degree 5 is #25508. Degree 8 is #22173.

I think it would be good to have all the (binary and ternary) form reconstructions in the same place, and as this reconstruction for odd degree is unrelated to hyperelliptic curves, it should not be implemented inside the hyperelliptic curve functions. It fits much better in/around `sage/rings/invariant_theory.py`. So I think the first step is to move the degree 6 code to the better location, and then implement the code for degree 5 and 8 there too. The code can then of course be wrapped by letting `HyperellipticCurve` accept a keyword.

I'm cc-ing the author of #25508 who may have already started working on such a move.

I agree that a general `invariants` method would be good, but that should be a topic for another ticket.
