At the moment the result from differentiation of the functions `conj`, `real`, `imag`,  `abs` does not take the argument domain into account.

```
sage: _ = var('x', domain='real')
sage: _ = var('z')

sage: (x^z).conjugate().diff(x)
x^(z - 1)*z*D[0](conjugate)(x^z)
sage: atan(x).imag_part().diff(x)
D[0](imag_part)(arctan(x))/(x^2 + 1)
sage: abs(log(z)).diff(z)
log(z)/(z*abs(log(z)))
```

GiNaC has functionality that is only now included in Pynac. The ticket should doctest it when it is implemented. It all benefits from recent domain logic improvements in Pynac as well.
