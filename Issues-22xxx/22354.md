As long as we don't change the python symlink this has very little potential for errors. But it'll allow us to add 2/3 regression tests, e.g. check that all sources can be compiled by python3 (though not on this ticket).

The variable `SAGE_PYTHON3` needs to be documented. It should have been documented before, but it was only used in the top level `configure` file. In this ticket it is starting to be used more widely, so documentation is more important.
