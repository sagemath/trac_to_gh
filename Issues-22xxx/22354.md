I guess Python 3 doesn't take that long to build, but most users won't ever use it, so why make it standard? Why not make it optional instead (including the other changes here so that installing Python 3 won't break Sage)?

The variable `SAGE_PYTHON3` needs to be documented. It should have been documented before, but it was only used in the top level `configure` file. In this ticket it is starting to be used more widely, so documentation is more important.

Hopefully most users WILL use Python 3 in the future ;-)
