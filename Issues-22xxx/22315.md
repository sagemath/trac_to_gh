The build succeeds, but `make install` fails at:

```
[giac-1.2.2.103] mv //home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/aide.exe /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/cas_help
[giac-1.2.2.103] mv: cannot stat '//home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/aide.exe': No such file or directory
```

It seems the main problem is it doesn't like the double `//` at the beginning of the path.  It probably should also end the filename with `.exe` though technically it doesn't matter so much.

I wonder why it installs this file under one name, and then renames it in the first place...

This patch fixes it.

I added pre- and post-autotools version of the patch.  Don't recall exactly what the convention is for this.
