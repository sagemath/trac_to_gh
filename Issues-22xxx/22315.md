The build succeeds, but `make install` fails at:

```
[giac-1.2.2.103] mv //home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/aide.exe /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/cas_help
[giac-1.2.2.103] mv: cannot stat '//home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/bin/aide.exe': No such file or directory
```

It seems the main problem is it doesn't like the double `//` at the beginning of the path.  It probably should also end the filename with `.exe` though technically it doesn't matter so much.

I wonder why it installs this file under one name, and then renames it in the first place...

To be clear, nothing here is very particular to cygwin.  The Makefile.am is generating incorrect paths on any platform (starting with `//`).  On most unices the superfluous slash will be ignored, but on Cygwin paths starting with `//` may be interpreted as a path on Windows network drive so it breaks.  Regardless, while the symptom is particular to Cygwin, the cause and the fix are not.
