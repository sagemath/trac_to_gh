```
The optional package `libbraiding` should enable the module `sage.libs.braiding`. But it does not. To check it, install the package `libbraiding` and then try:

```
sage: from sage.libs.braiding import *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-d9209c49d9c3> in <module>()
----> 1 from sage.libs.braiding import *

ImportError: No module named braiding
```

The problem is that `./sage -i libbraiding` installs the `libbraiding` package but not the Sage library module. One needs to additionally run `make sagelib` (or `make build` or `make`).

Absolutely.  Personally, I don't really consider this a bug. When you run `make libbraiding`, it installs the `libbraiding` package, which is different from the `sage.libs.braiding` Python module.

I do feel that this should be discussed on sage-devel first.
