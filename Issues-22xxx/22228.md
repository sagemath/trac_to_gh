On Mac, the `install_name_tool` used in `lcalc`'s `spkg-install` sometimes fails when directory names are longer than usual.

```
lcalc-1.23.p14] error: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/install_name_tool: changing install names or rpaths can't be redone for: /Users/mkoeppe/s/sage/sage-rebasing/another-local-sans-autotools/lib/libLfunction.dylib (for architecture x86_64) because larger updated load commands do not fit (the program must be relinked, and you may need to use -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names)
```
No error is signaled (due to a bug in `spkg-install`); but as a result, `libLfunction.dylib` cannot be loaded. This can lead to errors in the docbuild:

```

```

(As usual, the whole problem is caused by someone's hand-written Makefiles.)
Really, someone should autotoolize the package instead.
