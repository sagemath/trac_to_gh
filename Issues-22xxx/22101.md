(Feel free to add me in CC for tracs about giac or giacpy)

I was able to reproduce the problem with giac 1.2.2.103 on a debian 8.6 i686.
But updating to latest (stable )upstream release seems to fix the problem.

So I will build a branch like this.

Note that there are 2 versions of `config.guess` in the sources:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 44826 Feb  7 11:25 config.guess
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 44892 Oct  7  2008 config/config.guess

The one which is used is `config/config.guess`.

Given that even `1+1` segfaults, I did not state the obvious fact that the test suite also fails miserably.

Yes, completely silly of me - even if I was juggling several things at the time of the remark. Do you think it is related to `pari` or something different? Have you been able to narrow it down from a backtrace?

I am following the REAME file in following:
http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/debian/dists/stable/main/source
it says that
https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/giac_stable.tgz
is a link to the latest version in the debian directory. So for a pakcage it is better to point directly to an explicit number.

It's not -I cannot find it either. I cannot even remember how I found about that directory a few months ago. There are a few routes from the info on the web-site but it is all indirect and require a bit of exploration. For example if you go to https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/ where it says the latest sources are located you can find the `README` file mentioned by Frederic. 

The other way is to explore from the address indicated as the source of the debian repo.

Finally Han Frederic updated the address in `SPKG.txt` about 2 years ago
https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/43c68cc1cf32f9e93fdf90c4f4599f636a2aec70
That's probably where I got it from. Someone could ask Han how he knew but I suspect that's because he has direct contact with the author.

It doesn't look related to PARI, but it might be related to threading:

Compilation of giac works for me without the `--disable-png` option. Isn't it preferable to do the libpng stuff in #22159 (where there is an issue that might be solved in a different way), and focus here only on package upgrade and  `config.guess` ?

I think people had issue because of conflicting png version, so the easiest solution is to disable png completely first and devise a proper way to only use Sage provided png version in another ticket.

Otherwise if only this ticket gets included we'll end up with a broken solution in some cases.
