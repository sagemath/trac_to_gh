I don't think this should be very hard to add to the region plot or disk (or both) methods.  Not sure if there is a matplotlib primitive that supports this?

Nice, but you don't call this an annulus, and you should probably put it in the plot documentation (perhaps `region_plot`) and not the PREP document, since that is really a "fixed" legacy document that is intended for a different purpose - sort of a static tutorial.

Also check your formatting; the lines seems a bit long.

I have added the changes to the 'region_plot' section in the contour_plot.py file.

You should not add to the PREP tutorial is what I'm saying.   Revert that change.

Also, the lines for the documentation still seem more than 80 characters to me.  For example, this one has 93 characters (including initial spaces):

```
    An example of a region plot in 'linear' scale with 2 graphics primitive simultaneously::
```

```
An example showing the initial parameter can take into more than one inequalities::
```
is nonsensical English.

Finally, you still don't say *what* you are plotting - the whole point is that one can plot an annulus.

As a separate issue, it's too bad this can't be done as part of a graphics primitive like `Disk`.  Apparently matplotlib does support this - see e.g. [this example](http://matthiaseisen.com/matplotlib/shapes/wedge/#partial-wedge).  I'm opening a separate ticket for that, #22631.

I would keep in mind the line size from the next time.

I would love to have your insights what other examples should I add here.
