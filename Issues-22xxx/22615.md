I don't think this should be very hard to add to the region plot or disk (or both) methods.  Not sure if there is a matplotlib primitive that supports this?

I have added the changes to the 'region_plot' section in the contour_plot.py file.

You should not add to the PREP tutorial is what I'm saying.   Revert that change.

Also, the lines for the documentation still seem more than 80 characters to me.  For example, this one has 93 characters (including initial spaces):

```
    An example of a region plot in 'linear' scale with 2 graphics primitive simultaneously::
```

```
An example showing the initial parameter can take into more than one inequalities::
```
is nonsensical English.

Finally, you still don't say *what* you are plotting - the whole point is that one can plot an annulus.

As a separate issue, it's too bad this can't be done as part of a graphics primitive like `Disk`.  Apparently matplotlib does support this - see e.g. [this example](http://matthiaseisen.com/matplotlib/shapes/wedge/#partial-wedge).  I'm opening a separate ticket for that, #22631.

It was a blunder I would say, not removing the previous changes. I really apologize for that.

I would keep in mind the line size from the next time.

> Finally, you still don't say *what* you are plotting - the whole point is that one can plot an annulus.


I would love to have your insights what other examples should I add here.

I would look into the same after working on the suggestions given by you.
