the following example which was working with Sage 5.9 (cf Figure 9.1 page 193 of http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/) is no longer working with Sage 7.5.1:

```
  sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
  sage: J = R.ideal(x^2 * y * z - 18,
  ....:             x * y^3 * z - 24,
  ....:             x * y * z^4 - 6)
  sage: opts = {'axes':True, 'gridlines':True, 'frame':False,
  ....:    'aspect_ratio':1, 'axes_pad':0, 'fontsize':8,
  ....:    'xmin':-1.3, 'xmax':1.3, 'ymin':-1.3, 'ymax':1.3}
  sage: (ideal(J.0).plot() + ideal(J.1).plot()).show(**opts)
```
With Sage 7.5.1 I get:

```
TypeError: Singular error:
Close window to exit from `singularsurf`.
   ? calling `surf` failed
 (The shell returned the error code 32512.
   ? leaving surf.lib::plot
```
This is critical for the translation in german and in english of the book.

now with surf installed, the last command opens a new window where it is written:

Can you reproduce this? Is it really the expected behaviour?

Well, I never realized that Sage required `surf` for plotting ideals.

The doc of `plot?` is funny by the way:

```
        If you somehow manage to install surf, perhaps you can use
        this function to implicitly plot the real zero locus of this
        ideal (if principal).
```

If you type (with J the ideal in the description):

```
J0=ideal(J.0)
J0.plot?
```
then you get a more specific help:

```
Signature:      J0.plot(*args, **kwds)
Docstring:     
   Plot the real zero locus of this principal ideal.

   INPUT:

   * "self" - a principal ideal in 2 variables

   * "algorithm" - set this to 'surf' if you want 'surf' to

        plot the ideal (default: None)

   * "*args" - optional tuples "(variable, minimum, maximum)"

        for plotting dimensions

   * "**kwds" - optional keyword arguments passed on to

        "implicit_plot"
```
but none of `algorithm=None` and `algorithm='surf'` do work.

sorry I retract part of what I said in the description: the example in the book differs.
However the failure is still there. If plot is not able to deal with 3D ideals, I believe the error message should be improved.
