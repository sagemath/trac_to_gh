Keywords: sd87, padicIMA, padicBordeaux

I noticed that the methods `residue` and `_div_` are ridiculously slow over `Zq(p^n, prec)` when `prec` is very large.

Note: the original purpose of the ticket seems to have been resolved due to improvements to expansion method.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23172
