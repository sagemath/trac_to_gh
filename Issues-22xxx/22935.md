Add dual of `is_pseudocomplemented` to lattices.

Add crosslinks after #22745 has been closed. Also there was an error at #22901, `is_regular` has "weaker properties", whereas they should be stronger properties.

Actually the (meet-)pseudocomplement of an atom of a lattice is just the kappa function, and dually for coatom and join-pseudocomplement. Hence this needs not real code addition.

This contains also some corrections to crosslinks. Not sure if "Stronger properties: is_semidistributive(), is_meet_distributive(), is_constructible_by_doublings() (by lower pseudo-intervals)" is best possible solution, but can't figure out better.
