I should check that I can build it now. I changed system so I am starting from a cleaner slate. I used to have problem with russian documentation because of tex fonts problems. According to my ebuild I need the following from tex

```
L10N="ca de en fr hu it ja pt ru tr" USE=extra emerge -1Nv texlive
```
 I usually do 

```
VARTEX=$somelocations make doc-pdf
```
Gentoo doesn't install "unfolded" russian (and japanese?) tex fonts. If you don't specify VARTEX, it may try to do it in a system location.

Can you elaborate Steve? Do you mean that after doing that change the fonts are installed and you don't need to set VARTEX, or that I should check my build for missing fonts?

This was with vanilla and not s-o-g. I just did `make doc-pdf`. In doing that some japanese fonts could not be generated. I uncommented the `f cid-x.map` line although it could have been `f ckx.map` in order to get the build to complete.

```

The same `missfont.log` file is in `ja/a_tour_of_sage`. If I uncomment `%f cid-x.map` then everything builds. I'm not sure what's up but I can make the pdfs to build. I guess it's possible that since I didn't do

```
L10N="ca de en fr hu it ja pt ru tr" USE=extra emerge -1Nv texlive
```
I manually installed the packages - that that could be the difference? The only difference on my system is that `app-text/texlive-2015` would be rebuilt with `L10N="ca* de* en fr hu* it* ja* pt* ru* tr*`. But all the extra languages are installed.

It appears that, for whatever reason, I had a

Sorry for the noise Jeroen. We wanted to be sure we had the dependencies right.

My own experience here is that:
1) doc, including pdf and japanese pdf, in particular, build fine
2) it does so with or without `latex_memory.patch` so I guess we can drop it - unless someone has a different experience.

I am happy for this ticket to be sent to the bots once the offending patch is removed - or someone shows it is needed in some cases.
