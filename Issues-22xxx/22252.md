So I can make changes to the `\ifPDFTeX` thing but I'll have to do it "in the dark" without actually being able to check it.

I should check that I can build it now. I changed system so I am starting from a cleaner slate. I used to have problem with russian documentation because of tex fonts problems. According to my ebuild I need the following from tex

```
L10N="ca de en fr hu it ja pt ru tr" USE=extra emerge -1Nv texlive
```
 I usually do 

```
VARTEX=$somelocations make doc-pdf
```
Gentoo doesn't install "unfolded" russian (and japanese?) tex fonts. If you don't specify VARTEX, it may try to do it in a system location.

`/usr/bin/extractbb` is pulled in by `app-text/texlive-core-2015-r1`. The only thing I had to do is uncomment

```
%f  cid-x.map
```

in `/etc/texmf/dvipdfmx.d/dvipdfmx.cfg` so certain fonts could be generated.

Can you elaborate Steve? Do you mean that after doing that change the fonts are installed and you don't need to set VARTEX, or that I should check my build for missing fonts?

It was `%f  cid-x.map ` that I had to uncomment.

The same `missfont.log` file is in `ja/a_tour_of_sage`. If I uncomment `%f cid-x.map` then everything builds. I'm not sure what's up but I can make the pdfs to build. I guess it's possible that since I didn't do

It appears that, for whatever reason, I had a

```
~/.texlive/texmf-var/fonts/map/dvipdfmx/updmap/kanjix.map
```
file that was getting in the way of the build. Moving the `texmf-var` folder out of the way and I appear to now have a sane build of the pdf docs.

Sorry for the noise Jeroen. We wanted to be sure we had the dependencies right.

My own experience here is that:
1) doc, including pdf and japanese pdf, in particular, build fine
2) it does so with or without `latex_memory.patch` so I guess we can drop it - unless someone has a different experience.

I am happy for this ticket to be sent to the bots once the offending patch is removed - or someone shows it is needed in some cases.

Can we leave this to a follow-up ticket? The patch has been added in the past for a reason, so I'm not too keen to just drop it.
