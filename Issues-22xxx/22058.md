Motivation : recent changes in OpenSSL cause current git (2.6.2) to fail to compile with recent (>=1.1) version of openssl, due to changes in macros defining library function declarations.

This seems to have affected a number of packages. An example is given [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2016-December/443572.html), where the solution was a fix to the affected software (R package).

<a id='comment:4'>**Comment 4:**</a>
The proposed patch :
* build and installs cleanly a functional `git 2.11.0`
* sort-of passes its own test suite (fails on items marked as "known breakage" in the log) :

```
fixed   0
success 13952
failed  0
broken  192
total   14340
```
* results in a sage system that passes `ptestlong` with one known and unrelated failure (see #21884) :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 88.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

You are indeed right : we (as Sage users) do not need "recent" versions of anything.

But we (as users of other software, corresponding with other users of other software) need reasonably current versions of software more or less in sync with what our "real world" correspondents use. This, of course varies from use to use. For example, to work with other statisticians using R, I need in practice to be able to use R latest released versions (R-help won't answer questions related to bugs in older versions), and in order to submit a new or revised package, I have to check it against the latest (daily !) development version. 

We might also need new (real or virtual) machines (e. g. for testing purposes. So we need to accept installation on *reasonably* current machines. Therefore we have to be able to install Sage on these machines.

I agree that nobody in is right mind will install (and work on) debian unstable. But, except for servers purpose, nobody in his right mind will install debian stable either, at least on a personal work machine. Debian testing (or analogues in other distributions) seems to be the default choice, debian stable + backports (or reasonable facsimiles) being a distant second choice.

(not yet a ticket, because I'm not sure of the kind of answer to give).

So, all of this boils down to the definition of what is "reasonably current"... If "debian testing" or analogues are too new to be stated, the README.md file should state that.

Feel free to request a discussion on this topic on, e. g. sage-devel ; this might need clarification.

In the meantime, what do you think of the proposed patch ?

Well, for example there have been various updates to latest unreleased PARI master branch, because it was useful.

> But we (as users of other software, corresponding with other users of other software) need reasonably current versions of software more or less in sync with what our "real world" correspondents use.

The Long Term Support version should be one of the "reasonably current versions".

> This, of course varies from use to use. For example, to work with other statisticians using R, I need in practice to be able to use R latest released versions (R-help won't answer questions related to bugs in older versions), and in order to submit a new or revised package, I have to check it against the latest (daily !) development version. 

I have an apparently working way to use a recent (external) version of R in Sage/rpy2 (i did that for SDL), i will open a ticket, but i first have to close some branches because my laptop is old and i can not afford to swith branch and let it burn for recompilations.

> I agree that nobody in is right mind will install (and work on) debian unstable. But, except for servers purpose, nobody in his right mind will install debian stable either, at least on a personal work machine. Debian testing (or analogues in other distributions) seems to be the default choice, debian stable + backports (or reasonable facsimiles) being a distant second choice. For example, you can probably bet that Ubuntu 17.04 will have openssl 1.1.

My guess is that Debian moved 1.1.0 into testing because "The freeze is coming" (very soon), and of course Ubuntu 17.04 will follow since it is basically a snapshot of unstable (at least it was, i did not follow their recent evoltions).

Note however that Debian struggled with 1.1.0 in experimental for more that 6 months now, an that the current (in preparation) Ubuntu 17.04 still uses 1.0.2:

https://packages.qa.debian.org/o/openssl/news.rss20.xml
http://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/openssl

I just do not understand why we have to enter such a struggle. My guess is that openssl recently changed various things, so that various softwares went broken, and it is prehaps good to just wait that the situation get stablilized, i am not claiming we should stick to 1.0.2.

> Furthermore, this (understandable) reluctance to update can easily become a hindrance (think python2 vs python3). We have already been trapped by this in the past... and another trap is going to close on us : see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JPpJvUpP1TQ) : it's a nice one... (not yet a ticket, because I'm not sure of the kind of answer to give).

This is not a reluctance. Regarding the comparison with Python 2to3, we had to wait that all our dependencies get python3 ready anyway.

> So, all of this boils down to the definition of what is "reasonably current"... If "debian testing" or analogues are too new to be stated, the README.md file should state that.

The current testing is a pre-frozen, where maintainers are in a hurry to let things enter earlier because it will soon be forbidden.

It looks good. Unfortunately, i currently do not have the ressource to test it seriously :/

1've checked that git builds and passes its own testsuite :

```
[git-2.11.0] fixed   0
[git-2.11.0] success 13952
[git-2.11.0] failed  0
[git-2.11.0] broken  192
[git-2.11.0] total   14340
```
I'd rather not `make ptestlong` on this machine, which is too damned slow for the test (about 4 hours...).

<a id='comment:20'>**Comment 20:**</a>
Against Sage 7.5 built on a pristine Debian (testing) VM + current system's compilers and OpenSSL + development libs (`libssl-dev`, currently 1.1.0c)  :

* Passes its own testsuite, with similar results :

```
fixed   0
success 13276
failed  0
broken  185
total   13728
```

* The resulting sage passes `ptestlong` with no errors.

One notes that the testsuite 
* depends on an utility (`msgfmt`, in Debian's `gettext` package), that seems unneeded for anything else in Sage ;
* that the number of tests seems to depend on other installed software.

Still `needs_review`.
