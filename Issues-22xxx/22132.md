When defining point configurations with other base ring than QQ, the self reprensentation of the instance of the class PointConfiguration still returns QQ.

```
sage: AA(sqrt(2))
1.414213562373095?
sage: PointConfiguration([[AA(sqrt(2))]])
A point configuration in QQ^1 consisting of 1 point. The triangulations of this point configuration are assumed to be connected, not necessarily fine, not necessarily regular.
sage: PointConfiguration([[AA(sqrt(2))]]).base_ring()
Algebraic Real Field
```

The hardcoded "QQ" should be changed to be more flexible and actually return the type of base ring; e.g. AA, RDF, RLF or whatever. 

---

The code that needs to be changed reads:

```
        if self.is_affine():
            s += ' in QQ^'+str(self.ambient_dim())
        else:
            s += ' in P(QQ^'+str(self.ambient_dim()+1)+')'
        if len(self)==1:
            s += ' consisting of '+str(len(self))+' point. '
        else:
            s += ' consisting of '+str(len(self))+' points. '
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I think there are some issues with that class. First of all, the fact that it's "UniqueRepresentation" is quite awful: it means that the construction parameters are cached globally, and hence pinned in memory until the structure disappears.

Furthermore, is this actually a parent?

```
sage: P=PointConfiguration([[1.17,2]])
sage: parent(P[0])
<type 'sage.geometry.triangulation.base.Point'>
```

and the derivation of the base ring seems fishy too:

```
sage: PointConfiguration([[1.0,2]]).base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: PointConfiguration([[1.1,2]]).base_ring()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
That seems wrong.

For the string representation, I'd go for

```
"Point configuration in affine %s-space over %s"%(P.ambient_dim(),P.base_ring())
```

The reality is, `QQ,AA,RDF` aren't actually print names of rings. They are just convenience bindings to commonly occurring rings.

This is actually a parent; the problem is that the `__getitem__` returns the points, not the elements:

```
sage: p = PointConfiguration([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[-1,-1]])
sage: p.an_element()
(<1,3,4>, <2,3,4>)
sage: parent(p.an_element()) is p
True
sage: list(p)
[P(0, 0), P(0, 1), P(1, 0), P(1, 1), P(-1, -1)]
```

Although I don't see the problem with this being a `UniqueRepresentation`. It isn't like the inputs are some strange/large objects that we want garbage collected. I was going to say there is enough computationally heavy things cached to further justify this, but what gets cached is not what I was expecting.

That can be a lot of points! And as you can see (because the parent needs to be normalized), the original input points would be a rather bad key to base the construction on.

Yes, the caching is fine, but I don't think we'd get much benefit from additionally keying that cache globally under the construction parameters rather than simply on the object itself and requiring that the user will keep a reference to the object for as long as he/she wants access to that cache.

Thank you guys for replying to the ticket! 

Ok, should the issue with `UniqueRepresentation` be moved to a new ticket?
And should we also open a ticket adressing the issue with the derivation of the base ring?

In this ticket simply wanted to make sure that is doesn't say "points in `QQ`", when the points are not rational.
