Originally reported as a comment in 
#16726:

```
sage: R.<n> = AsymptoticRing('n^QQ', QQ)
sage: binomial(n, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from Asymptotic Ring <n^QQ> over Rational Field to Symbolic Ring
```

However, 

```
sage: sage.arith.misc.binomial(n, 3)
1/6*n^3 - 1/2*n^2 + 1/3*n
```
works as expected.
