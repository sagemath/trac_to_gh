CC:  @egourgoulhon @embray @kiwifb

When building Sage from scratch, the following happens:

```
ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```

In `src/setup.py`, the method `run_autogen` is ran *after* discovering and building the Python modules. So, the Python module `sage/ext/interpreters/__init__.py` is not installed.

This problem was introduced in #21613.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22094

Untested hypothesis: the "Discovering !Python/Cython source code" part below is run **before** auto-generating the sources, which is the wrong order:

```
print("Discovering Python/Cython source code....")
t = time.time()
from sage_setup.find import find_python_sources
python_packages, python_modules = find_python_sources(
    SAGE_SRC, ['sage', 'sage_setup'])
```

The auto-generated files might not be discovered this way, leading to those files being considered for cleaning.

As for the parallel build, running `make` a second time leads to a successful build.
In other words, `make && make` works, while a single `make` fails...

It's not "Generating Interpreter Sources", it's "Generating auto-generated sources". So both the comment and the `print` statement are wrong in this regard.

Amusing considering I copied pasted the original `print` statement from Erik. I can see it was more general before #21613.
