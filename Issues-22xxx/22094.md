When building Sage from scratch, the following happens:

```
ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```

In `src/setup.py`, the method `run_autogen` is ran *after* discovering and building the Python modules. So, the Python module `sage/ext/interpreters/__init__.py` is not installed.

This problem was introduced in #21613.

As for the parallel build, running `make` a second time leads to a successful build.
In other words, `make && make` works, while a single `make` fails...

Amusing considering I copied pasted the original `print` statement from Erik. I can see it was more general before #21613.

OK for the stopgap status. If Erik, think it can be done better he is welcome to do it, but it is the last blocker for 7.5 so getting things out is important. New commit coming soon.
