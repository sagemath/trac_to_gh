When building Sage from scratch, the following happens:

```
ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```

In `src/setup.py`, the method `run_autogen` is ran *after* discovering and building the Python modules. So, the Python module `sage/ext/interpreters/__init__.py` is not installed.

This problem was introduced in #21613.

Untested hypothesis: the "Discovering !Python/Cython source code" part below is run **before** auto-generating the sources, which is the wrong order:

```
print("Discovering Python/Cython source code....")
t = time.time()
from sage_setup.find import find_python_sources
python_packages, python_modules = find_python_sources(
    SAGE_SRC, ['sage', 'sage_setup'])
```

The auto-generated files might not be discovered this way, leading to those files being considered for cleaning.

With the correction proposed in #22098, the non-parallelized build with `make` goes further but
halts at the same error as reported in the current ticket, i.e. 

```
[dochtml]   File "sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd", line 7, in init sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface (/home/eric/sage/7.5.rc0-22098/src/build/cythonized/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.c:12253)
[dochtml] ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```
So clearly the issue is not due to the parallel build.

As for the parallel build, running `make` a second time leads to a successful build.
In other words, `make && make` works, while a single `make` fails...

Amusing considering I copied pasted the original `print` statement from Erik. I can see it was more general before #21613.
