When building Sage from scratch, the following happens:

```
ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```

In `src/setup.py`, the method `run_autogen` is ran *after* discovering and building the Python modules. So, the Python module `sage/ext/interpreters/__init__.py` is not installed.

This problem was introduced in #21613.

Untested hypothesis: the "Discovering !Python/Cython source code" part below is run **before** auto-generating the sources, which is the wrong order:

```
print("Discovering Python/Cython source code....")
t = time.time()
from sage_setup.find import find_python_sources
python_packages, python_modules = find_python_sources(
    SAGE_SRC, ['sage', 'sage_setup'])
```

The auto-generated files might not be discovered this way, leading to those files being considered for cleaning.

OK I can reproduce it at will here by taking a full build and then doing `MAKE="make -j8" ./sage -ba` (not sure if it fails with a single threaded build). `./sage` will crash and complain about `interpreters.wrapper_rdf` in the crash report.

With the correction proposed in #22098, the non-parallelized build with `make` goes further but
halts at the same error as reported in the current ticket, i.e. 

```
[dochtml]   File "sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pxd", line 7, in init sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface (/home/eric/sage/7.5.rc0-22098/src/build/cythonized/sage/plot/plot3d/parametric_surface.c:12253)
[dochtml] ImportError: No module named interpreters.wrapper_rdf
```
So clearly the issue is not due to the parallel build.

As for the parallel build, running `make` a second time leads to a successful build.
In other words, `make && make` works, while a single `make` fails...

It's not "Generating Interpreter Sources", it's "Generating auto-generated sources". So both the comment and the `print` statement are wrong in this regard.

About the actual solution: I'm pretty sure that Erik won't like it (in `setup.py`, you are supposed to only do stuff within the `setup()` call). However, this fixes a blocker issue, so I am OK with this branch being a stopgap.

Amusing considering I copied pasted the original `print` statement from Erik. I can see it was more general before #21613.

OK for the stopgap status. If Erik, think it can be done better he is welcome to do it, but it is the last blocker for 7.5 so getting things out is important. New commit coming soon.
