Fractional ideals are elements (of a monoid) but currently they print as verbosely as if they were parents:

```
sage: F.<r> = NumberField(x^2-10)
sage: F.ideal(3,r+1)
Fractional ideal (3, r + 1)
```

The problem gets worse for ideals of ZZ:

```
sage: ZZ.ideal(3)
Principal ideal (3) of Integer Ring
```

I propose that the ``_repr_`` method is changed so the two previous outputs read, for example:

```
sage: F.ideal(3,r+1)
((3, r+1))
sage: ZZ.ideal(3)
((3))
```

Another option would be

```
sage: F.ideal(3,r+1)
(3, r+1)*Z_F
sage: ZZ.ideal(3)
(3)*ZZ
```
but the first one seems informative enough. One can easily get all the other information from available methods of the ideal.
