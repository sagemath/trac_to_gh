I find this `Poset()` construction quite confusing because there is no `1` element defined:

```
LatticePoset({0:['a','b','c'], 'a':[1], 'b':[1], 'c':[1]})
```
(example from `src/sage/combinat/posets/lattices.py` line 1593)

This is really an abbreviation of

```
LatticePoset({0:['a','b','c'], 'a':[1], 'b':[1], 'c':[1], 1:[]})
```
but it is not well documented.

Yes. More interesting example is converting

```
Poset( ([1,2,3], [[2,3],[3,4]]) )
```

to

```
Poset( ([3], [[2,3],[3,4]]) )
```

Removing `2` does nothing. but removing `1` does, as only elements uncomparable to all others need to be specified at the element list. Sometimes I think if we should change this.

`DiGraph({1:[2,3,4],3:[4]})` -- return a digraph by associating to each vertex the list of its out-neighbors.

It is not `DiGraph({1:[2,3,4],3:[4],2:[],3:[]})`. Should we change that too? I think that nothing needs to be change. Isn't it clear that list of upper covers `{1:[2],2:[3]}` means that `3` has no upper covers?

?? `DiGraph({1:[2]})` means that vertex `2` has no outgoing edges. `Poset({1:[2]})` means that element `2` has no upper covers.

But in both cases I think that the documentation needs no clarification. I think it is natural and clear not to excplicitly say that an element has no upper covers.

Hence I suggest this to be closed as wontfix.

I think it does need clarification. Maybe you are so used to it that it is obvious to you, but that doesn't mean that it's obvious to everybody.

When I first saw that example, I didn't understand it. Then I looked at the documentation of `Poset` which didn't say that such constructor was allowed. So at that point I thought there was a genuine bug in the example. Only later I realized that the example was ok, but that the documentation was not.

If that is true, it would be a very good idea to document it! Then you could even remove the discussion of allowed input formats of `Poset` and just point to `DiGraph`.
