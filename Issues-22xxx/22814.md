With 3.2.3:
- on 64bit, the build was OK and self-tests lead to 1 error (CTestTestUpload)
- on 32bit, the build failed at configure time

With 3.8.0:
- on 64bit, the build is OK and self-tests lead to 2 errors (CTestTestUpload and RunCMake.ctest_submit), but the second test did not exist on 3.2.3.
- on 32bit, the build is OK and 7 self-tests failed out of 442 (98% tests passed)

So, regarding GNU/Linux, the state of this package is strictly better than before.

However, i had to remove the `osx10.10.patch` patch since it does not apply anymore. So, if you have access to such machines, please have a look to OSX builds.

Also, looking at the `bootstrap` script, i was wondering whether we should add `xz` as a dependency and add the `--system-liblzma` option. Does this makes sense ?
