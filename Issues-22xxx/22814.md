With 3.2.3:
- on 64bit, the build was OK and self-tests lead to 1 error (CTestTestUpload)
- on 32bit, the build failed at configure time

With 3.8.0:
- on 64bit, the build is OK and self-tests lead to 2 errors (CTestTestUpload and RunCMake.ctest_submit), but the second test did not exist on 3.2.3.
- on 32bit, the build is OK and 7 self-tests failed out of 442 (98% tests passed)

So, regarding GNU/Linux, the state of this package is strictly better than before.

However, i had to remove the `osx10.10.patch` patch since it does not apply anymore. So, if you have access to such machines, please have a look to OSX builds.

Not what I have done or my recommendation. I am also working on silencing the other two tests. I am acting only on `spkg-check`

```/usr/bin/env bash

cd src
unset MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
ctest -E "(CTestTestStopTime|TestUpload)"
```
That made the framework test pass and silenced the `TestUpload` one. Gentoo silence the `TestUpload` one too amongst other. I still have to do something about `ctest_submit`. Have to find the right command.
