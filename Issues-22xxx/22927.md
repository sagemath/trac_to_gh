<a id='comment:22'></a>I don't see the point of keeping it optional here. 

This ticket is a prerequisite of #22928 which is a prerequisite of #23024. 

In my point of view, changes concerning gmpy2 package should be listed in this ticket, change concerning gmpy2 integration with sage in #22928 and change specifics to pplpy integration in #23024.

And I don't see any reason to make it standard here. It's not used by anything, so why should it be standard?

"Just having plans to use it in the future" is not sufficient reason IMHO to make a package standard.

> For now the check of the package fail


In that case, I'm not sure whether the package can be accepted. At a minimum, could you add a patch to disable the failing tests, such that `gmpy2` at least formally passes its testsuite?

Second, you should better document how you obtained this tarball. Posting a tarball on your personal home page without further explanation is not sufficient. Is there any chance you could convince upstream to make a proper release? That would of course be much better.

Note that you have never set this ticket to needs_review. If you want this to be merged in Sage, you'll need to do that.
