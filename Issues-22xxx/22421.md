No idea about the time because the cause of that is not established with certainty. So, as fixing this the usual way would need a new release that includes #22364 it would be best to not do a release but commit a Pynac patch (containing https://github.com/pynac/pynac/commit/a4dce19f33fc52245f324cb535d24233988dcfa1.diff) with this branch.
