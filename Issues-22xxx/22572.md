What is the username of Vincent Klein?

I should try to push a version complete "draft version" very soon. Not much is left.

Meanwhile, a question: is it possible that a ref block in rst can not include math mode?

Thanks Marcelo!

My question refers to the fact that I make references to the base classes using `:ref:` and in this block, the `math` does not appear, like QQ and ZZ. I do not know why...

As for reviewers, you are welcome to review the ticket! I am not completely done yet though... That's why I left it as new. I still want to put some more work in there, but I thought that it is good if people can have a look at it already!

I would not order a tutorial by method. This is what the reference manual is about. You should find a "fil rouge". I think the best way to proceed is to have concrete big problems and show how to solve it in Sage step by step.

Furthermore, I think that it is very good to have exercices in thematic tutorials!

EDIT: there are actually a lot of different files:
- `is_this_polyhedron.rst`
- `lectures.rst`
- `new_from_old.rst`
- `related_objects.rst`
- `tips.rst`
- `visualization.rst`
I think it is bad to put these rather generic names. Geometry is not just about polyhedra...

1. Change the title `Tutorials for the Geometry module of Sage` into `Polyhedra` in the file `geometry.rst`

2. At the very top of the main thematic tutorial page there is a nice distinction between *quickrefs*, *primer* and *tutorial*. It would be good to tag the different files you wrote accordingly.

Thanks for the tutorial!

I only have a few remarks/corrections

* has the ambient space --> as the ambient space
* should the explanation for "is_compact" perhaps mention the word "bounded"?
* add a link for "composite_field" (and change the word to "composite_fields")
* the reason why we cant do computations in the symbolic ring is given as because it is "not exact". Perhaps we could simply state that it is not implemented. (Computations in RDF are also "not exact")
* access to vertices ... --> access vertices ...
* remove the part "clearly (!)" (or is this a joke I don't get?)
* in the sage_input example, I suggest to change whats there to 

```
sage: Cube = polytopes.cube()
sage: TCube = Cube.truncation().dilation(1/2)
sage: sage_input(TCube)
```
That is add "dilation" to avoid "QQ(1)" many times, which doesn't look pretty.
