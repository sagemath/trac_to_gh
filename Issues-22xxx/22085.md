We should patch the default gsl.pc so it doesn't include `gslcblas`. Two main reasons:
* It is distro friendly. We have to remove it from the output of gsl.pc is `module_list.py`. In distro (Gentoo for example) can ship gsl.pc without gslcblas. The current setup will fail in if gslcblas cannot be removed.
* If someone really want to use gslcblas (possibly an external one) the current setup may strip it completely.

This was an incremental build. I do have `libopenblas` in /local/lib.

Yes, `cblas.pc` is from ATLAS. So, do I have to build from scratch to get rid of ATLAS? This is a bit off-topic. This ticket looks OK and I believe to be necessary.

Interesting, even after

```
./configure --with-blas=openblas
make
```
I still have atlas generated `.pc` files

```
grep ATLAS local/lib/pkgconfig/*

local/lib/pkgconfig/blas.pc:Description: blas for sage, set up by the ATLAS spkg.
local/lib/pkgconfig/cblas.pc:Description: cblas for sage, set up by the ATLAS spkg.
local/lib/pkgconfig/lapack.pc:Description: lapack for sage, set up by the ATLAS spkg.
```

And for example

```
pkg-config --libs fflas-ffpack
-L/64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/lib -lfflas -lffpack -lcblas -lgivaro -lgmpxx -lgmp
```
which links to atlas cblas. I'm thinking things are not right or else I'm doing something really stupid.
