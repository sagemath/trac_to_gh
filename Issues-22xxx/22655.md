```
This enhances `sage_setup.find.find_extra_files` to better support non-Python resources found in Python package sources.  Previously it could include extra files found under `build/cythonized`, but now it can also include arbitrary files (including support for `fnmatch` patterns) that should be installed alongside a Python package.  For example,

```python
find_extra_files('sage.foo', '.', special_filenames=['*.html'])
```

will find any `.html` files under the `./sage/foo/` package.

This will be useful for #21732 and possibly other tickets.

This also adds a `package_data` variable in `module_list.py` that can list all non-Python resources on a per-package basis (using the same format as the standard [`package_data` option to setup.py](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data).  This includes handling of package data in a way that's compatible with `sage_setup.clean.clean_install_dir`.

First of all, there is an easy conflict with #22662.

The function `find_extra_files` was obviously meant to find extra *Cython* files since it looks for `.pxd` and `.pxi` files.

It makes sense to generalise this, but then it should no longer handle `.pxd` and `.pxi` files by default: those should be passed as `*.pxd` and `*.pxi` arguments by `sage_build_ext.copy_extra_files`.

For what value of "work"? Do you mean "work" as in: doesn't raise an exception? Or "work" as in: actually does something meaningful?

It makes little sense to run just `build_ext` without anything else. In the real world, build scripts have a natural order and dependencies. You cannot cherry-pick pieces of a build system and expect those pieces to be meaningful individually. Especially if you want something like https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1514 (which I think is a good idea) you cannot run `build_ext` individually.

Splitting the installation of data files in two, just because it adheres to some theoretical principle that nobody cares about, looks like a bad idea to me.

I do that almost every day on 'normal' projects.  `./setup.py build_ext --inplace` is the best thing to doing in-source development of a project that uses extension modules.

In any case, by overthinking it you're actually making it more complicated and less reliable.  It works fine as is.

You don't need to link me to a Wikipedia article on "KISS".

In fact complexity is sometimes subjective.  You're upset because you see what looks like a little bit of code duplication (actually, I don't see it as duplication; it's doing two somewhat different things that nonetheless look similar due to using the same API), but without it in fact you're relying on a fragile, poorly documented/specified state machine to do things in the right order or else everything breaks.  That to me is complexity.
