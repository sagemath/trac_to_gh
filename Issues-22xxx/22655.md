```
This enhances `sage_setup.find.find_extra_files` to better support non-Python resources found in Python package sources.  Previously it could include extra files found under `build/cythonized`, but now it can also include arbitrary files (including support for `fnmatch` patterns) that should be installed alongside a Python package.  For example,

```python
find_extra_files('sage.foo', '.', special_filenames=['*.html'])
```

will find any `.html` files under the `./sage/foo/` package.

This will be useful for #21732 and possibly other tickets.

This also adds a `package_data` variable in `module_list.py` that can list all non-Python resources on a per-package basis (using the same format as the standard [`package_data` option to setup.py](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data).  This includes handling of package data in a way that's compatible with `sage_setup.clean.clean_install_dir`.

First of all, there is an easy conflict with #22662.

The function `find_extra_files` was obviously meant to find extra *Cython* files since it looks for `.pxd` and `.pxi` files.

It makes sense to generalise this, but then it should no longer handle `.pxd` and `.pxi` files by default: those should be passed as `*.pxd` and `*.pxi` arguments by `sage_build_ext.copy_extra_files`.

For what value of "work"? Do you mean "work" as in: doesn't raise an exception? Or "work" as in: actually does something meaningful?

It makes little sense to run just `build_ext` without anything else. In the real world, build scripts have a natural order and dependencies. You cannot cherry-pick pieces of a build system and expect those pieces to be meaningful individually. Especially if you want something like https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1514 (which I think is a good idea) you cannot run `build_ext` individually.

Splitting the installation of data files in two, just because it adheres to some theoretical principle that nobody cares about, looks like a bad idea to me.

I do that almost every day on 'normal' projects.  `./setup.py build_ext --inplace` is the best thing to doing in-source development of a project that uses extension modules.

In any case, by overthinking it you're actually making it more complicated and less reliable.  It works fine as is.

I think this makes sense, actually.  The only thing is that `build_cython` needs to be responsible for providing a list of resource files it generates (.h files, etc.), but we could free it from responsibility for actually *copying* them.  I don't think it makes a difference either way really but I don't care much at this point either.
