I am coming back to this and I think more generally this bit of `sage-env` is not helpful:

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/cpp" ]; then
    CPP=cpp

```
This will overrides what autotools default to, which is `$CC -E` (or `$CXX -E` if the current language is C++) and only if that's not working `cpp`.
