I'm starting to work on getting Sage working on 32-bit Cygwin again (64-bit is basically working minus a few unmerged patches).

The build fails while building flint (though it looks not unlikely to have something to do with NTL as well).  Buried among hundreds of warnings about `long long` is the actual error:

```
/opt/sagemath-7.4/local/include/NTL/SmartPtr.h: In member function 'void NTL::AlignedArray<T, align>::SetLength(long int)':
/opt/sagemath-7.4/local/include/NTL/SmartPtr.h:1420:44: error: there are no arguments to 'posix_memalign' that depend on a template parameter, so a declaration of 'posix_memalign' must be available [-fpermissive]
   if (posix_memalign(&p, align, n*sizeof(T))) MemoryError();
                                            ^
