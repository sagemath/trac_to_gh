Apparently they don't always show up properly, and in any case our doc only has the labels, not the legend setting documented (directly in the hist doc, I mean).  See [this ask.sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36210/legend-for-histogram/) question for more details.

So we would have to be careful in setting `handlelength` as in the ask.sagemath solution, looking at many legend examples.

The Legend class can be considered as a container of legend handles and legend texts. Creation of corresponding legend handles from the plot elements in the axes or figures (e.g., lines, patches, etc.) are specified by the handler map, which defines the mapping between the plot elements and the legend handlers to be used.

Using histogram legends can sometimes yield results in which nothing seems to happen even when the code has no error. There is a common problem that legend is not initialised and set_legend_options doesn't seem to do anything. However, it's not a bug rather it is the way it should be defined that would help to yield a result.

* labelspacing :	the vertical space between the legend entries
* handlelength :	the length of the legend handles
* handleheight :	the height of the legend handles
* handletextpad:	the pad between the legend handle and text
* borderaxespad: the pad between the axes and legend border
* columnspacing:	the spacing between columns
* title	       :  the legend title
* and many more parameters would decide how the labels would look like.


```
d1=[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]
d2=[4,4,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2] 
h=histogram([ d1,d1 ],label=["d1","d2"],stacked=True, color=['blue', 'red'])
h.legend(True)
h.set_legend_options(handlelength=1,handleheight=1,handletextpad=1,borderaxespad=2)
h
```

In the above example h.set_legend_options() can take in numerous parameter to customize the representation of the labels in histograms.


```
d1=[randint(0,10) for i in range(20)]
d2=[randint(0,10) for i in range(20)]
h=histogram([d1,d2],label=["d1","d2"])

h.legend(True)
h.set_legend_options(handlelength=1,handleheight=1,fontsize=50,labelspacing=0,title="Parameters")
h
```

title, fontsize, handlerheight etc parameters can be modified as per the requirement of the user.

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>\nHi, \n\nThere are a few more changes needed:\n1. *The Legend class can be considered as a container of legend handles and legend texts.Creation of corresponding legend handles from the plot elements in the axes or figures (e.g., lines, patches, etc.) are specified by the handler map, which defines the mapping between the plot elements and the legend handlers to be used.*  - is not very clear. Calling the Legend class a container is slightly incorrect. The docstrings are meant to be simple and informative enough for the user to understand what different functionalities they have access to. I don't think this is needed.\n2. *Histogram legends has a 'set_legend_options' which can take in various parameters that can customise the labels.Different parameters would decide how the labels would look like. Considering the following examples::* - The last line is unnecessary. Add a space after end of sentence and check grammar please. And use back ticks to denote special names like so `set_legend_options`.\n3.  pdf latex documentation does not build.\n4. (Trivial) Add spaces. For instance, `sage: d1 =  [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]`.\n5. The first two examples you added are nearly identical in that they don't really demonstrate different functionalities. Instead, you can just use one example and describe in the docstring that there are several options whose details can be found in matplotlib documentations by adding an appropriate hyperlink. \n6.

Hi, 

There are a few more changes needed:
1. *The Legend class can be considered as a container of legend handles and legend texts.Creation of corresponding legend handles from the plot elements in the axes or figures (e.g., lines, patches, etc.) are specified by the handler map, which defines the mapping between the plot elements and the legend handlers to be used.*  - is not very clear. Calling the Legend class a container is slightly incorrect. The docstrings are meant to be simple and informative enough for the user to understand what different functionalities they have access to. I don't think this is needed.
2. *Histogram legends has a 'set_legend_options' which can take in various parameters that can customise the labels.Different parameters would decide how the labels would look like. Considering the following examples::* - The last line is unnecessary. Add a space after end of sentence and check grammar please. And use back ticks to denote special names like so `set_legend_options`.
3.  pdf latex documentation does not build.
4. (Trivial) Add spaces. For instance, `sage: d1 =  [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]`.
5. The first two examples you added are nearly identical in that they don't really demonstrate different functionalities. Instead, you can just use one example and describe in the docstring that there are several options whose details can be found in matplotlib documentations by adding an appropriate hyperlink. 
6. The third example you added is a repeat of one that has been written above. This is not redundant.
7. You haven't mentioned the output of the examples in the documentation. See previous examples to understand what you have to write.

The HTML documentation builds. But the latex documentation is showing errors. Can you check that once please?

Thanks.

I have removed this section as it makes the documentation complex for a new user.

Considering the following examples::* - The last line is unnecessary. Add a space after end of sentence and check grammar please.

Removed the unnecessary line in the end.
> 3.  pdf latex documentation does not build.

I would like to know more about latex doctest . I am currently checking just HTML testing.

> 4. (Trivial) Add spaces. For instance, `sage: d1 =  [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3]`.

Spaces has been added .

Example removed and refered by a hyperlink.

Am I supposed to put the plot over here? because the output over here is a graphical representation of data.
