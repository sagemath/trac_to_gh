This cannot be right, can it?

```
sage: M = matrix([(3,-1,0,0),(1,1,-2,0),(0,0,0,-3)])
sage: B = matrix(QQ,3,1, [0,0,-1])
sage: M.rows()
[(3, -1, 0, 0), (1, 1, -2, 0), (0, 0, 0, -3)]
sage: B.rows()
[(0), (0), (-1)]
sage: M.nrows()
3
sage: B.nrows()
3
sage: M.solve_left(B)
...
ValueError: number of rows of self must equal number of rows of B
```

The author name is now missing (should be in "First Last" format). Also, remove all of your (added) trailing whitespace and break this long line into <80 characters long:

```
        If the number of columns on the left and right hand sides is different it raises the error message 'number of columns                    of self must equal number of columns of B'
```
Actually, I would just remove that line altogether as it doesn't add anything practical to the documentation and you have the examples.
