On Ubuntu 16.04, with this branch on top of 8.0.rc0, and using `--optional=ccache,cmake,cryptominisat,mpir,python2,sage`, I get after `MAKE='make -j8' make ptestlong`:

```

sage -t --long --warn-long 60.8 src/sage/sat/boolean_polynomials.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

which means this ticket does not create new doctest problem (I get the same two errors on 8.0.rc0) but also means that it does not solve #15585.

Do you have the actual test failure?
