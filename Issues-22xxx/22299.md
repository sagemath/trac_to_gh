Plase add doctest that shows this new behaviour.

Instead of importing `collections` and testing for `col.Iterable` why not just directly import `Iterable`?

Can you document the logic behind these lines?

```sage
           (not data[1] or (
                isinstance(data[1], (list, tuple))
                and isinstance(data[1][0], col.Iterable)))):
```
I.e. either there are no edges or there are and ...?

Why did you add the same test three times?  You should always test all corner cases, for example the case when the edges iterator is empty. Also, can you please add some reasonable use cases into EXAMPLES section so this new feature is actually discoverable by the users?

Thanks to your comments I spotted an error:

```sage
isinstance(data[1], Iterable) and
            # the "edges" item of the pair is either empty ...
            ((not data[1])
```
if `data[1]` is empty then it will never be an instance of `Iterable`. The logic needs to be different here.

These are different tests.  Please spot the difference between the locations of `(...)` vs. `[...]` there.

> You should always test all corner cases, for example the case when the edges iterator is empty.


Sure, I'll add some corner cases.

> Also, can you please add some reasonable use cases into EXAMPLES section so this new feature is actually discoverable by the users?


Will do.

> if `data[1]` is empty then it will never be an instance of `Iterable`. The logic needs to be different here.


That's false:

```sage
sage: from collections import Iterable
sage: isinstance([], Iterable)
True
sage: isinstance((), Iterable)
True
```

Rewriting the constructor might take long time, I would like to hear your opinion about it before attempting to do so.

The main issue here is that we want the Graph constructor to take anything as input and let it (somehow magically) deduce what the user has in mind. This is quite hard to do ;) 

You raised an ambiguity in the input format, and I have no clue how to solve that. May be it's not possible since 2 different users may expect different treatments. Note that vertex labels can also be tuples...

I fully agree that the Graph constructor needs to be rewritten / cleaned / improved...
