Currently, the ` sage_input` function of a Polyhedron object does not provide the backend used.

```

sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='normaliz')
sage: sage_input(P1)
Polyhedron(base_ring=ZZ, rays=[(1, 1)], vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='ppl')
sage: sage_input(P2)
Polyhedron(base_ring=ZZ, rays=[(1, 1)], vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])

```

It should be able to give it.

One way to go, since each (backend/base_ring) combination creates a different parent in parent.py would be to create an init function for each of these parents that executes the init of the `Polyhedra_base` and adds an attribute `_backend` on top.

Because doing it in Polyhedra_base seems to be messy (how to know the backend information at this stage?).

I looked at it again and now think its best to put it in `parent.py.` There a treatment that is analogous to `ambient_dim` and `base_ring` is possible. Please have a look at the patch!

Once the `backend`-function is approved it will be easy to enhance the `sage_input`-function as requested in the description of the ticket.

The backend method looks good. I guess you can proceed with the sage_input part.

For now, I get:

Expected:
    Polyhedron(backend='polymake', base_ring=ZZ, rays=[(1, 1)], vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])

If you don't want to see the `QQ(.)`, there's the option `preparse=False` in `sage_input`.

Hi Moritz,

All tests pass on beta3. It seems to fix the issue with the backend. I put a TODO in the doctest to add handling of the `preparse` option of `sage_input` eventually to get rid of the `QQ` in the output.

Look at the change and if you are happy, you can set it as positive review.

That does not seem to be enough. I'm puzzled by how to fix this. Now the `__init__` of the polyhedron base class requires 4 arguments. But how to pass this new argument when having a subparent class `Associahedra`.

I changed also line 33 like this:

```
33     parent = Associahedra(QQ, cartan_type.rank(),'ppl')
```

to get the correct backend. But I still get similar errors. Any cues?
