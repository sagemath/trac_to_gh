Currently, the ` sage_input` function of a Polyhedron object does not provide the backend used.

```

sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='normaliz')
sage: sage_input(P1)
Polyhedron(base_ring=ZZ, rays=[(1, 1)], vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='ppl')
sage: sage_input(P2)
Polyhedron(base_ring=ZZ, rays=[(1, 1)], vertices=[(0, 1), (1, 0)])

```

It should be able to give it.

One way to go, since each (backend/base_ring) combination creates a different parent in parent.py would be to create an init function for each of these parents that executes the init of the `Polyhedra_base` and adds an attribute `_backend` on top.

Because doing it in Polyhedra_base seems to be messy (how to know the backend information at this stage?).

<a id='comment:15'></a>Hi Moritz,

All tests pass on beta3. It seems to fix the issue with the backend. I put a TODO in the doctest to add handling of the `preparse` option of `sage_input` eventually to get rid of the `QQ` in the output.

Look at the change and if you are happy, you can set it as positive review.

That does not seem to be enough. I'm puzzled by how to fix this. Now the `__init__` of the polyhedron base class requires 4 arguments. But how to pass this new argument when having a subparent class `Associahedra`.

I changed also line 33 like this:

```
33     parent = Associahedra(QQ, cartan_type.rank(),'ppl')
```

to get the correct backend. But I still get similar errors. Any cues?

Perhaps as a follow-up, it would be good to change the inheritance of the `Associahedron_class` to `Polyhedra` ? What do you think?

Otherwise, as of now, I would put this ticket as positive review.
