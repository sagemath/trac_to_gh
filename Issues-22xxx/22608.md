Following sage-devel PYTHONPATH breaks Python3[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ITtF1vWIxIk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ITtF1vWIxIk)

Having PYTHONPATH sets as an environment variable is reported to be incompatible with the installation of both Python2 and Python3 and with the use of gdb to debug.

We should remove the setting of the PYTHONPATH environment variable

Note to reviewer : the doctest in all.py has been modified. I choose to modify allowed.append(os.path.join("lib", "python", "multiprocessing")) into allowed.append(os.path.join("multiprocessing")) rather than allowed.append(os.path.join("lib", "python2.7", "multiprocessing")) in order to stay compatible with future python version.

I don't understand your changes to `all.py`:

1) What is the reason of this modification? Were the tests failing without it? If not, I would prefer to not touch anything there. You said to "stay compatible with future Python version" but did you actually checked this?

2) The aim of `os.path.join` is precisely to *join* several directories and files into a path like

```python
>>> import os
>>> os.path.join('my', 'path', 'to', 'my_file.py')
'my/path/to/my_file.py'
```
   if the path would only be one string there is no need to use join

3) If you start touching this, why not modifying at the same time

```
wallowed = [os.path.join("lib","python","threading.py")]
```

1) Yes the all.py doctest fail without the modification. If PYTHONPATH is set you get the frames
\\
<sage_path>/local/lib/python/multiprocessing/process.py\\

<sage_path>/local/lib/python/multiprocessing/forking.py\\

<sage_path>/local/lib/python/multiprocessing/process.py.\\

If PYTHONPATH is not set you get \\

<sage_path>/local/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py\\

<sage_path>/local/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/forking.py\\

<sage_path>/local/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py instead and the old doctest failed.

2) Ok.

3) Basically because i didn't get a matching frame during my tests but that's the case for several other item's of the allowed list. Should we rewrite this doctest with this ticket ?

You should also check the length of `[inspect.getmodule(f) for f in frames if is_not_allowed(f)]`.

In fact its nothing to do with OSX, this kills our ability to call the system python as soon as SAGE_LOCAL is created (which is way sooner in the build process than when we install our own python):

```
if [ -d "$SAGE_LOCAL" ]; then
    PYTHONHOME="$SAGE_LOCAL"
    export PYTHONHOME
fi
```
resulting in 

```
$ PYTHONHOME=/foo/bar python
ImportError: No module named site
```
IMHO we should just unset PYTHONHOME/PYTHONPATH if they are set (and print a warning that this can't work); Then python will just default to whichever directory is compiled in. The whole PYTHONHOME/PYTHONPATH thing is probably a holdover from the past where we did not clean up paths compiled into binaries.
