Qepcad, which comes with a hand-written `Makefile`, doesn't set the `rpath` when linking. This leads to dynamic linking errors involving `libstdc++` if the C++ compiler inside Sage is not the C++ compiler from the system.

We also replace the patch added in #10224 by setting the `Makefile` variable `SHELL`.
