Qepcad, which comes with a hand-written `Makefile`, doesn't set the `rpath` when linking. This leads to dynamic linking errors involving `libstdc++` if the C++ compiler inside Sage is not the C++ compiler from the system.

We also replace the patch added in #10224 by setting the `Makefile` variable `SHELL`.

I didn't test in a setting where there was a failure, but the changes look good; and it still works on Mac OS X with this patch.
Thanks for getting rid of the unnecessary patching too.
