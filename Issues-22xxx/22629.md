I'm running the `spkg-check` scripts for each standard package (I haven't normally built with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`).  It could reveal some bugs that are not caught by Sage's test suite, but that could nevertheless affect Sage.

For now I will just list packages whose tests are failing for me; I will open separate tickets for individual packages that look worth investigating (for example, the failures in cysignals are worth looking into; whereas the failing tests for curl maybe not so much as it is not a direct dependency of Sage...).  The packages that have failing checks/tests are:

* curl (7.53.1)
* cysignals (1.3.2)
* cython (0.25.2.p0)
* flint (2.5.2.p1)
* giac (1.2.3.25)
* pcre (8.40)
* python2 (2.7.13.p1)
* python3 (3.5.1)
* r (3.3.3.p2)
* zeromq (4.2.5)

zeromq is also failing.  I don't know if it passed earlier but IIRC it did not , and was just left off this ticket by mistake.
