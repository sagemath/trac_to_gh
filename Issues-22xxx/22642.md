It is good to Cythonize things that can be called quite frequently.

I also go through and change the base class to `ClonableArray` from `CombinatorialElement`. This helps out things like the R-matrix computation, which relies heavily on hashing and is slow because `CombinatorialElement` uses the string representations to hash. However, all crystal elements should be hashable, so we can just hash the input.

I'm also taking this opportunity to do a little bit of extra cleanup of the methods.

Depends on #22429

With this branch, I get:

```
sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['D',5], shape=[4,2,1])
sage: %time for x in T: x
CPU times: user 4.98 s, sys: 68 ms, total: 5.05 s
Wall time: 4.88 s
sage: La = RootSystem(['D',5,1]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: B = crystals.ProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths(La[3])
sage: %time L = [hash(x) for x in tensor([B,B])]
CPU times: user 11.2 s, sys: 52 ms, total: 11.2 s
Wall time: 11.1 s
```
vs the old

```
sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['D',5], shape=[4,2,1])
sage: %time for x in T: x
CPU times: user 8.06 s, sys: 32 ms, total: 8.09 s
Wall time: 8.03 s
sage: La = RootSystem(['D',5,1]).weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: B = crystals.ProjectedLevelZeroLSPaths(La[3])
sage: %time L = [hash(x) for x in tensor([B,B])]

This ticket might seem like a lot, but it is really fundamentally a move to a Cython file and doing some simple optimizations.

- Your conventions for the descriptions are not always consistent. Sometimes you use upper case letter "- ``i`` -- An element of the index set" but sometimes you also use lower case letter "- ``i`` -- an element of the index set"

Fixed.

> - Your conventions for the descriptions are not always consistent. Sometimes you use upper case letter "- ``i`` -- An element of the index set" but sometimes you also use lower case letter "- ``i`` -- an element of the index set" 

This was from the existing code and the move over. However, this is a good chance to move this to Sage's convention of lower case. Fixed.
