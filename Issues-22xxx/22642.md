It is good to Cythonize things that can be called quite frequently.

I also go through and change the base class to `ClonableArray` from `CombinatorialElement`. This helps out things like the R-matrix computation, which relies heavily on hashing and is slow because `CombinatorialElement` uses the string representations to hash. However, all crystal elements should be hashable, so we can just hash the input.

I'm also taking this opportunity to do a little bit of extra cleanup of the methods.

vs the old

```

Testing that Sage starts...
[2017-04-28 16:17:10] SageMath version 8.0.beta2, Release Date: 2017-04-12
************************************************************************
It seems that you are attempting to run Sage from an unpacked source
tarball, but you have not compiled it yet (or maybe the build has not
finished). You should run `make` in the Sage root directory first.
If you did not intend to build Sage from source, you should download
a binary tarball instead. Read README.txt for more information.
************************************************************************
Sage failed to start up.
Please email sage-devel (http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel)
explaining the problem and send the log file
  /Applications/sage/logs/start.log
Describe your computer, operating system, etc.

Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make all'):

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.
