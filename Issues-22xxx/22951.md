<a id='comment:5'></a>Thank you very much for this piece of work! It's a great enhancement to manifolds in Sage. Moreover the code looks very good and the documentation is carefully written and nice. A first quick comments (more will follow):

- Some doctests fail due to some extra (debug?) messages:

```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/manifold_homset.py", line 575, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.IntegratedCurveSet
Failed example:
    c = H(eqns_rhs, vels, t, v, name='c') ; c
Expected:
    Integrated curve c in the 2-dimensional differentiable
     manifold M
Got:
    The curve was correctly set.
    No parameter appears in the differential system defining the curve.
    Integrated curve c in the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
- Another doctest failure is that of `c.__reduce__()` in line 556 of `integrated_curve.py`, apparently due to `<class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold_homset.IntegratedCurveSet_with_category.element_class'>` appearing instead of `<class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedCurveSet_with_category.element_class'>`

- Some methods are too verbose, e.g. `solve`, `tangent_vector_eval_at`, `plot_integrated` and `__call__` in class `IntegratedCurve`; `verbose=False` should be the default (this seems a general policy in Sage)

- The documentation fails to build: 
  * in `integrated_curve.py`, line 1712: the continuation mark `....:` is invalid in a plot directive; line 2413: a final quote is missing in `'epolar_ON)`
  * in `manifold_homset.py`, lines 938 and 1386:  `EXAMPLES:` must be replaced by `EXAMPLES::`

<a id='comment:9'></a>Thanks for the changes.
Here are more comments:
- There are still some failed doctests:

```
5 items had failures:
   1 of  12 in sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedAutoparallelCurve.__reduce__
   1 of  27 in sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedCurve
   1 of  98 in sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedCurve.?
   1 of  13 in sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedCurve.__reduce__
   1 of  14 in sage.manifolds.differentiable.integrated_curve.IntegratedGeodesic.__reduce__

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 82.5 src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/integrated_curve.py  # 5 doctests failed
```
- The method `__call__` of class `IntegratedCurve` should return a manifold point, not a list of coordinates
- Lines 428-437 of `integrated_curve.py` could be replaced by a mere

```
        if initial_pt not in chart.domain():
            raise ValueError("initial point should be in the " +
                             "domain of the chart")
```
  Btw notice that, by convention, error messages start with a lower case letter and do not end by any ponctuation mark.
- To ensure that the `print` function used in `integrated_curve.py` complies with Python3, please insert

``` 
from __future__ import print_function
```
  in the heading of this file.
- I am wondering whether it is worth to keep the arguments `is_identity` and  `is_isomorphism` in the `__init__`'s of the integrated curve classes and in the related construction methods of class `DifferentiableManifold`; this adds some code complexity for something which regards only curves *(a,b)* --> **R** and for which it is difficult to imagine a use case... Do you agree?
- Maybe the documentation TOC would be more descriptive if the title "Integrated Curves in Manifolds" in line 2 of `integrated_curve.py` were replaced by "Integrated Curves and Geodesics in Manifolds".
- In the docstring of method `plot_integrated`, the keyword arguments `display_tangent`, `plot_points_tangent`, `color_tangent` and `width_tangent` are not documented.
- In the second sentence of the main docstring in `manifold_homset.py`, starting line 9, the classes `IntegratedCurveSet`, `IntegratedAutoparallelCurveSet` and `IntegratedGeodesicSet` should be added to the list of subclasses of `DifferentiableManifoldHomset`

Thanks for the changes.

OK.

OK, very good.

OK.

`is_identity` and `is_isomorphism` still appear in the documentation of the integrated curve methods of class `DifferentiableManifold`...

>In particular, no identity map is implemented by method `one` of the parent classes; this is justified by the lack of relevance of the identity map within the framework of the classes of this ticket, whose purpose is mainly devoted to numerical issues (therefore, any user is left free to set a numerical version of the identity if needed).


Indeed.

> - The title of the documentation of `integrated_curve.py`, now in line 3, is now "Integrated Curves and Geodesics in Manifolds".


Thanks.

> - The documentation of method `plot_integrated` is now complete.


In that documentation, the default value of `plot_points_tangent` should appear as 10, not 75.
> - The main docstring of `manifold_homset.py` is now complete.


Thanks.

A few minor points regarding the PoincarÃ© half-plane example in the main docstring of `integrated_curve.py`:
- typo: `PoicarÃ©` --> `PoincarÃ©`
- the plot does not appear in the documentation (missing `sphinx_plot`)
- on this example, we have
  {{{
  sage: c(0) == p
  True
  }}}
  but
  {{{
  sage: c.tangent_vector_eval_at(0) == v
  False
  }}}
  Indeed, `c.tangent_vector_eval_at(0)` is a tangent vector at `p`:
  {{{
  sage: c.tangent_vector_eval_at(0) in M.tangent_space(p)
  True
  }}}
  but it does not coincide with `v`:
  {{{
  sage: c.tangent_vector_eval_at(0).display()
  1.0865965337902876 d/dx + 1.536951899804222 d/dy
  }}}

Finally, as revealed by the patchbot, the syntax for the example blocs should be `EXAMPLES:`, not `EXAMPLE:`, even if there is only one example.

Thanks a lot for the cleanup! The above commit fixes an error in a PLOT directive (missing `=` sign), and fixes some failed doctests in `manifold.py` and `manifold_homset.py` due to the replacement of "w.r.t." by "with respect to". It also adds some extra cleanup.

Sorry; I blindly did a search and replace in `integrated_curves.py` (although I do prefer the explicitness).

You should probably add an # abs tol to all numerical results unless you intentionally write code with IEEE floating point reproducibility in mind.

<a id='comment:27'></a>Thanks a lot for all the corrections.

As suggested, an absolute tolerance (# abs tol) was added to all numerical results in the doctests.

Additionally, methods `__call__` and `tangent_vector_eval_at` of class `integrated_curve` were modified following the model of corrections made in method `plot_integrated` (starting on lines 1907, now 1908, and 2084, now 2085) in commit [0f0c67b](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=0f0c67b2de1300f0f39a2e6592be1cea64862729).

(Precisions about these are given here in case of future improvements regarding interpolation.

The corrections in methods `__call__`, `tangent_vector_eval_at` and `plot_integrated` concern tests on the class of the objects implementing interpolations of the numerical solutions computed with method `solve`.
For now, only class `sage.calculus.interpolation.Spline` is used, but these tests anticipate the fact that new classes implementing other methods of interpolation might be introduced.
Of course, in such case, tests such as `if not isinstance(interpolation[0], Spline):` (such as in lines 1604, 1694,..) should become `if not isinstance(interpolation[0], (Spline, OtherInterpolationClass)):`.

But modifications of the source code induced by the introduction of new interpolation classes should be limited to the above tests and the content of method `interpolate`.
This means that an instance of `OtherInterpolationClass` should allow to be called as it is done in lines 1609, 1709, 1954, ..., and should admit a method `derivative` to be called in lines 1703, 2018...)
