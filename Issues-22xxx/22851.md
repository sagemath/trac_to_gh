I did see the error systematically while testing ticket 0 on the quasar patchbot (I did it only twice though).

The patchbot quasar has:
- Intel i7-2600
- 8G of RAM (+ 3G swap)
- Ubuntu 16.04 (packages up to date)
- tests are run in parallel with the option `"parallelism": 6` of the patchbot

I am recompiling a clean 8.1.rc0 with qepcad only to see if I can reproduce.

Hi Volker,

Some time ago I explicitly asked about the support status for optional packages in sage on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oDJS-7R0qzE/iRieFYnRAQAJ). In that thread [Jeroen answered](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oDJS-7R0qzE/WCHDW4jhAQAJ) that optional packages causing doctest failures should be considered blockers. So this is why I made this and the other ticket blocker, and no one objected to that later in the discussion. It would be helpful if you could also state your opinion on this in that sage-devel thread so that other people won't do the same in the future.

Thanks,
Maarten
