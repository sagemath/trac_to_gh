I think the error might be non-deterministic. I have seen it on my patchbots too, but it does not happen every time.

My vote would be to downgrade qepcad to experimental for now.

Could you please provide a link to the corresponding logs, so that we can guess the common factor ?

Vincent: i am not sure to understand: you get the error systematically on that machine ? Does the doctest fail when run alone from the command line ? Could you evaluate the evolution of available RAM, dmesg, whether you ar running within a VM, etc. Perhaps this patchbot just runs out of some ressource and the `finihsh` is a kind of error that should just be handled by the interface.

I did see the error systematically while testing ticket 0 on the quasar patchbot (I did it only twice though).

The patchbot quasar has:
- Intel i7-2600
- 8G of RAM (+ 3G swap)
- Ubuntu 16.04 (packages up to date)
- tests are run in parallel with the option `"parallelism": 6` of the patchbot

I am recompiling a clean 8.1.rc0 with qepcad only to see if I can reproduce.

Hi Volker,

Some time ago I explicitly asked about the support status for optional packages in sage on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oDJS-7R0qzE/iRieFYnRAQAJ). In that thread [Jeroen answered](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/oDJS-7R0qzE/WCHDW4jhAQAJ) that optional packages causing doctest failures should be considered blockers. So this is why I made this and the other ticket blocker, and no one objected to that later in the discussion. It would be helpful if you could also state your opinion on this in that sage-devel thread so that other people won't do the same in the future.

Thanks,
