#20885 added a Normaliz/PyNormaliz interface, providing a fast backend for polyhedra, and in particular implementations of the `integral_points` and `integral_hull` methods.

On this meta ticket, we collect all tickets related to normaliz.

On follow-up tickets, should:
- provide fast implementations of existing methods of Polyhedron, Cone, triangulations, ...
- provide new methods for Normaliz's additional features.

Some features may already be exposed via polymake. 

Adding these methods would not require Cython programming and would happen on several separate tickets. 

Computation goals - see section 4.3 in the [Normaliz manual](https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz/blob/master/doc/Normaliz.pdf)

Tickets:
- #22684: pynormaliz fails to build on 32bit system
- #22645: Polyhedron_normaliz: Expose computation options
- #25090: Upgrade pynormaliz to 1.14 or higher (2.0?)
- #25091: Add some normaliz features
- #25097: Algebraic polyhedra with QNormaliz / e-antic
- #28379: clean normaliz backend
- #28633: Add `__copy__` method to backend normaliz of Polyhedron
- #28639: Polyhedron_normaliz: Initialize new cone from both Vrep and Hrep
- #27952: upgrade Normaliz to 3.8.4, PyNormaliz to 2.10, install nauty header/library, add patch to e-antic
- #28873: Implement ambient volume of polyhedron with normaliz 
- #20879: Half-open polyhedra with ppl and normaliz
