For a bunch of R's shared library modules it does not explicitly include `-l` flags for libraries they link to, as it is not necessary to do so, for the most part, on Linux.

However, on Windows it is necessary to resolve all symbols at link time.  This patch fixes the issue, and is otherwise harmless.

This issue was already reported upstream some years ago, and rejected as invalid since the R developers do not support Cygwin.

Depends on #20523
