For a bunch of R's shared library modules it does not explicitly include `-l` flags for libraries they link to, as it is not necessary to do so, for the most part, on Linux.

However, on Windows it is necessary to resolve all symbols at link time.  This patch fixes the issue, and is otherwise harmless.

This issue was already reported upstream some years ago, and rejected as invalid since the R developers do not support Cygwin.

Attachment [r-3.3.3.p1.log](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket22627/r-3.3.3.p1.log) by gouezel created at 2017-03-25 11:28:37

Doesn't work for me (i.e., I think the patch fixes some build issue of R, but not all of them for me), on cygwin64 on x86_64, windows 10 pro. Short version: a file `libR.so`is correctly produced, but next I get

```
gcc -fopenmp  -L../../lib -L/home/Sebastien/sage33/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/Sebastien/sage33/sage/local/lib  -o R.bin Rmain.o  -lR 
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-cygwin/5.4.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-cygwin/bin/ld: cannot find -lR
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```
Is it looking for `libR.dll` instead? 

Log file attached.
