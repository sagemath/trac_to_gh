```
There are a few sets of operators defined on cones that we can generate. If `K` is a polyhedral cone, then there's

* K.positive_operators_gens()
* K.cross_positive_operators_gens
* K.Z_operators_gens()
* K.lyapunov_like_basis()

Those sets are themselves polyhedral closed convex cones, and in the last case, a vector space.

Given a matrix `L`, it is natural to ask: does `L` belong to one of those sets with respect to a given `K`?
