Inspired by the `--exitfirst` option to `py.test`, this adds a `--exitfirst` option to Sage's test runner to exit immediately upon the first test failure.

I've wanted something like this at several points, but one reason in particular is that part of the build of the patchbot Docker image is to perform the baseline test run, so that the image itself can be reused without having to rebuild the baseline each time.  Obviously, if a test fails during the baseline test run then I want the Docker image build to fail immediately, and not wait until the rest of the test suite has run.

> Inspired by the `--exitfirst` option to `py.test`, this adds a `--fail-once` option to Sage's test runner to exit immediately upon the first test failure.

Obvious question: why not call the Sage option `exitfirst`? I find it a better name than `fail-once`.
