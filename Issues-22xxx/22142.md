```
At the moment we have

```
sage: polylog(QQbar(sqrt(2)),3)
polylog(1.414213562373095?, 3)
```
and

```
sage: log(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
0.346573590279973
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber'>
```
So the logarithm of an exact value loses the exactness.

I would expect a symbolic expression

```
sage: log(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
log(1.414213562373095?)
```
where the argument is the symbolic encapsulation of `QQbar(sqrt(2))` (for the same reason why the logarithm of the integer 2 becomes the symbolic `log(2)`.

This is fixed for all `GinacFunctions` in Pynac git master. The ticket should doctest them in the resp. files under `sage/functions`.

Depends on #22219

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I have a Pynac patch that does this:

```
sage: log(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
log(1.414213562373095?)
sage: log(QQbar(sqrt(2))*1.)
0.346573590279973
```
However, the question is raised if you don't want this for all functions, and if you do, if we want to hold all functions with exact arguments (except where we have a simplified representation, i.e., a closed form that is simpler than the function expression).

EDIT: or if not all functions, then which?
