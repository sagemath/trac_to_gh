On behalf of Felix Boes I suggest an improvement to the `ChainComplex_class`: In the function `_chomp_repr_`, replace:

```
                 if col.nonzero_positions():
                     for j in col.nonzero_positions():
```
by

```
                 nonzero_pos = col.nonzero_positions()
                 if nonzero_pos:
                     for j in nonzero_pos:
```

Then the method should be faster, since `nonzero_positions` is only called once and not each time the loop is executed.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Thanks for your comment Travis! I meant to substitute the second occurrence of col.nonzero_positions() as well, see the second commit. 

Then it really seems to be faster:


After the change:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,1000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 1.07 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,2000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 4.37 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,3000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 13.9 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,5000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 34 s per loop
```
Before the change:

```
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,1000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 1.21 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,2000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 5.06 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,3000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 15.1 s per loop
sage: C = ChainComplex({0:random_matrix(ZZ,5000)})
sage: %timeit C._chomp_repr_()
1 loop, best of 3: 55.5 s per loop
```
