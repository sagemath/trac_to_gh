In the Sage notebook

```
P = Posets.PentagonPoset()
P.moebius_algebra?
```

formats badly. Same applies to `quantum_moebius_algebra?`, but `incidence_algebra?` is OK.

They should also have `SEEALSO`-links to corresponding algebras.

Same happens with `graphs.MoebiusKantorGraph?` and `graphs.GrotzschGraph?`, so it relates to non-ascii letter, I guess. I don't know if there is something we can do to this. Maybe Frédéric knows.

Yes. Old problem, that I have seen a long time ago. But `sagenb` is essentially dead.
