There is a problem with the normalization of names of variables which are given automatically for finite fields.

```
sage: K = GF(4)
sage: K._factory_data
(<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor.FiniteFieldFactory'>,
 (7, 5, 'beta6'),
 (4, 'z2', x^2 + x + 1, 'givaro', "{'prefix': 'z'}", 2, 2, True), {'prefix': 'z'})
     ^^^^
```

Here the name of the variable(s) is not normalized and should be `('z2',)`. Compare with:

```
sage: L = GF(4, name='z2')
sage: L._factory_data
(<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor.FiniteFieldFactory'>,
 (7, 5, 'beta6'),
 (4, ('z2',), x^2 + x + 1, 'givaro', '{}', 2, 2, True),
 {})
```

By the way, should `K == L`. Currently, it is false.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

I have two comments:

1) The following should definitely NOT return True:

```
sage: GF(17^180) == GF(17^180, 'z180')
False
```
The first syntax (which was enabled "on popular request", but is too seductive in my opinion) creates the finite field as a subfield of an algebraic closure, which is expensive because it has to create a system of compatible (pseudo-Conway) polynomials.  Compare the following timings:

```
sage: %time GF(17^180, 'z180')
CPU times: user 64 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 72 ms
Wall time: 71 ms
Finite Field in a of size 17^180
sage: %time GF(17^180)
CPU times: user 8.62 s, sys: 36 ms, total: 8.66 s
Wall time: 8.66 s
Finite Field in z180 of size 17^180
```

2) The `prefix` parameter was introduced to store the name used for (subfields of) an algebraic closure.  I don't think it should be added to every finite field regardless of whether it is embedded in an algebraic closure.

I propose to limit this ticket to just normalising the variable (with a doctest showing the correct factory data), nothing else.
