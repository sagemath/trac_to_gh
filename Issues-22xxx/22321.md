For most types, the following would work, but it does not for `Gen`:

```
sage: t = type(pari(2))
sage: t(2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-35638e9214b8> in <module>()
----> 1 t(Integer(2))

TypeError: __init__() takes exactly 0 positional arguments (1 given)
```

It makes sense to change this but it will require some refactoring of the `new_gen` mechanism.

If we keep going along this path, `pari(x)` will be reduntant with `Gen(x)`. Then we won't need `libs.pari.pari` to be a *callable namespace* anymore, nor will we need the `PariInstance` class. At that point cypari would start resembling an ordinary Python module, with no crazy hacks. Using it would look like

```
>>> from cypari import *
>>> x = Gen('x')
>>> p = x**2 + 3
>>> K = nfinit(p)
>>> K == p.nfinit()
True
```

At that point, it would seem logical to rename `Gen` to `Pari`, or at least to have such an alias.

I like this!

Anyway, none of this seems to be strictly needed for #20238, does it?

Well, `__pow__` doesn't work because it expects `Gen` to work in some way, but that expectation is not an absolute necessity. It is indeed a sensible way for a class to behave, though.

I guess this would work.

A better way would be to move the code of `objtogen` into `Gen.__init__` (and then we could remove `objtogen`). The `_pari_` method would be hard to support without a copy, unless we require that `_pari_` needs to return a new object every time (it cannot be cached).

However, I'm not saying that this should be done now.

I was thinking of something else: usually, the Python convention is that special methods have double underscores. Should we replace `_pari_` by `__pari__`?
