Avoid using comparison (which may not always work, may not provide a total order, etc.) when all we want as far (as I understand) is an arbitrary total order.

I don't get the point of this ticket. There are so many places where `G.vertices()` is called for a graph `G`. Why are all those other places ok but not this specific one that you are changing in this ticket?

I don't really remember. But looking at the commit, it looks like this code wants to consider edges (u,v) with u â‰¤ v in the order in which the vertices are looped over. Sorting them by id is an easy way to avoid doing true comparisons without making deeper changes...

So you're asking to review a ticket when even *the ticket author* cannot remember the purpose of that ticket?

I do remember that the goal was to fix problems that arose when trying to disable comparisons between objects with incompatible parents (#22029)â€”as you know, since it was you who wanted to make this a separate ticket. I don't remember exactly why I thought this would be a correct fix here but not elsewhere. And I'm hoping for comments from people who know this code better than I do, hence the `needs_review`.
