Avoid using comparison (which may not always work, may not provide a total order, etc.) when all we want as far (as I understand) is an arbitrary total order.

I don't really remember. But looking at the commit, it looks like this code wants to consider edges (u,v) with u ≤ v in the order in which the vertices are looped over. Sorting them by id is an easy way to avoid doing true comparisons without making deeper changes...

I do remember that the goal was to fix problems that arose when trying to disable comparisons between objects with incompatible parents (#22029)—as you know, since it was you who wanted to make this a separate ticket. I don't remember exactly why I thought this would be a correct fix here but not elsewhere. And I'm hoping for comments from people who know this code better than I do, hence the `needs_review`.
