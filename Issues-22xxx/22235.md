Hello, over here in SMC-world, we have a global [SageMath](SageMath) install. One thing users like to do is to run ` sage -pip install --user ... }}. Problem is, with version 7.5 there is this {{{pip-lock` script in place, which prevents them from doing that. The problem is:

```
Traceback (most recent call last): 
File "/projects/sage/sage-7.5/src/bin/pip-lock", line 33, in <module> 
lock = open(lockfile, "w+") 
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 
'/projects/sage/sage-7.5/local/var/lock/pip.lock'
```

Digging up what's going on, it's because the path to the lock is based on  `sys.prefix`. Therefore, this is kind of broken for everyone who is running [SageMath](SageMath) 7.5 via a common global installation.

The most simple solution that I'm proposing here is to use the locking only for installing packages as part of building Sage itself (the original intended use) and not use when running `sage --pip`.

It certainly can't be a temporary directory. It must be a deterministic directory for the locking mechanism to work.

One trivial solution would be to use the locking only for installing packages as part of building Sage itself and not use when running `sage --pip`
