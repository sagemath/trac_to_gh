If we change git branches, `make doc` often fails. It turns out that the cache mechanism in sage doc builder caused these failures. The patch implements a robust logic to auto-update module docs using the information from the Sphinx environment rather than from the cache.

Hi,

Thanks for this suggestion ! I've a few question for your patch.

- Usually caching is here for performance reason. Did you test that there isn't a huge speed loss ?

- Can you explain a little in the description of this patch how your new robust logic works ?

- Finally, from a first glance, It seems that you don't handle the 'underscore' option anymore, do you ?

Cheers,

Florent

Here is how to reproduce the problem: I went to `7.6.beta6` and compiled the doc normally. Then I switched to `22588` and issued a `make doc-clean` and `make doc`.

Now the code with the quickfixes works fine for me. How about you?

I will try to answer your questions as far as I understand the old and the new code :-) First I describe the use of cache in the old code:

The cache stores the list of the modules for which rst files were auto-generated in the previous run of the doc builder. In a new run, the list of the modules for which rst files should be auto-generated is computed and compared with the list in the cache. The rst files of newly added modules are auto-generated. Then the cache is updated.  

In the new code:

In a new run, the list of the modules for which rst files should be auto-generated is computed, and the modules are put into "new", "updated", "removed", "old" bins, comparing with the list of rst files which were auto-generated in the previous run of the doc builder (this formation is in the Sphinx environment). For modules in "new" and "updated" bins, new rst files are auto-generated. The modules in "removed" are removed. The modules in "old"  are just kept.

Replying to [hivert](#comment%3A3):
> Usually caching is here for performance reason. Did you test that there isn't a huge speed loss ?


The merit of caching here is that supposedly we do not need to look into the "sage/..." folder to get the list of modules for which rst files were auto-generated. The new code gets the information from the Sphinx environment (`.all_docs`). There is no loss in speed.

> Can you explain a little in the description of this patch how your new robust logic works ?


The information about the files in "sage/..." from the Sphinx environment is *independent* from git branch changing, unlike the cache. The dependence of the cache on git branch was the cause of the failures. 

> Finally, from a first glance, It seems that you don't handle the 'underscore' option anymore, do you?


The (new/old) code is not responsible for handling the 'underscore' option. Is it?

Thanks for asking.

Thanks for clarifying all of these

> The (new/old) code is not responsible for handling the 'underscore' option. Is it?


I'm pretty sure the old code is:

```
if (inherit_prev is None or inherit_prev != options.inherited or
            underscore_prev is None or underscore_prev != options.underscore):
```
They are two options that force us to regenerate all the stub:

- `inherit` -- whether we show inherited funs and attrs in the doc
- `underscore` -- whether we show private (starting with __) funs and attrs

If any of those two option are changed, then every stub must be regenerated, because these option are included in the stub file as in

```
.. automodule:: sage.sets.integer_range
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```
This needs to be taken care of in your logic.

One annoying problem I noticed is that we now have these warning as a side effect of `__import__(module)`: 

```
[dochtml] /Users/Kwankyu/GitHub/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py:909: DeprecationWarning: the module sage.rings.commutative_ring is deprecated and will be removed
[dochtml] See http://trac.sagemath.org/20011 for details.
[dochtml]   __import__(module)
```

Could we just ignore these or can you provide how to fix this?

As I understand, the Sphinx autodoc extension also import a module to do its work. So importing a module is not a problem. Sphinx seems not to spit out the warning messages...

You are right. Deprecation warnings were already there. My branch did not create new ones.

I think this is a good case where suppressing deprecation warnings is good and harmless. Those warnings are targeted for *users* of deprecated classes and methods. In our case, there is no real use of the deprecated. And the user who is building the reference manual would just wonder why he or she gets those warnings and has nothing to do to avoid them.

On the other hand, I once observed that some hyperlinks don't work properly in the docs built without `make doc-clean`.

I would like to give this a positive review, but here is an issue: I tested this by deleting a file – I happened to choose `homology/koszul_complex.py`, along with its link in the reference manual. When I rebuilt the docs with the `develop` branch, it crashed because of the missing file, but with this branch, the docs built. That's great. What's not as great is that with this branch, the other pages in the `homology` part of the reference manual were not changed to reflect the missing page, so for example, `cell_complex.html` was not rewritten and so still has the line

```
    <link rel="next" title="Koszul Complexes" href="koszul_complex.html" />
```
(This means that at the top of that page, it says "Next page: Koszul complexes".) Fortunately (?), the page `koszul_complex.html` was not deleted, so the link still works.

Note also that there are still references to `koszul_complex.html` in the search indices.

The problem with docbuilding before this branch is that the auto-generated `koszul_complex.rst` would remain, while this branch does a good job of cleaning it up. What about these other references to `koszul_complex.html`? Deal with here or on another ticket, or ignore altogether?

A similar problem happens when you add a file: suppose you are adding a file "B.py" whose html file is supposed to go between "A.html" and "C.html" (that is, in "A.html", the next topic should point to "B.html"). If the docs have already been built, with A.html pointing to C.html, then you add B.html, the links in A.html and C.html will not change: they will point to each other as previous and next topics.

With the "develop" branch, docbuilding fails completely so you have to delete the built docs, so you never see this problem. With the branch from this ticket, you see it. Essentially the same question as in my previous comment: is the rest of this enough of an improvement that we can put off this problem to another ticket?

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A56):
> There is an important regression: #23975


I looked at #23975. As far as I understand, an issue was raised about sage-location and fixed by a patch there. Is the regression still present? What is the regression? Is there something to be done here? Help me catch up.
