One reason for double underscore is that they correspond to actual implementation of special Python syntax
- `a.__len__()` is `len(a)`
- `a.__add__(b)` is `a + b`
- etc

Do you have an actual reference for why we have to switch fron one to two underscores?

Do you have a reference for that? There is something about underscores in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id36) but, after reading it, I still don't know which underscore style to use. And the Sage `_foo_` style doesn't even exist for PEP 8.

One could argue that `x.__pari__()` is `pari(x)` that's not really relevant.

Special methods in Python use the `__foo__` underscore style. I consider `__pari__` to be very similar in spirit to Python's `__int__` or NumPy's `__array__`. Since no PEP or Python documentation documents how to name custom special methods, I think that `__pari__` makes the most sense.

Let's look at our options:

1. `_pari_()`: not documented/used anywhere except for Sage.

2. `_pari()`: meant for *private* methods, which is not correct here. We want this method to be part of the CyPari2 public API.

3. `__pari()`: even more private, so even less applicable.

4. `__pari__()`: consistent with Python and NumPy. The only issue is that creating such names possibly goes against the Python documentation.

5. `pari()`: very simple but it doesn't make it clear that it has a special meaning. Higher chance of false positives with people using a `pari()` method for something else.

My first choice is 4, my second choice would be 5.

Right, but we do not have to change everything at the same time. We can do this for each interface separately. I just wanted to do this for `_pari_` now because of CyPari2.

There is some though. I always find it hard to make a decision in these circumstances. I'm in favor of the change, but what should be considered as sufficient consensus?
