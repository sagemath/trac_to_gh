Special methods in Python usually have double leading and trailing underscores. For this reason, it makes sense to use `__pari__` for conversion to CyPari2.

One reason for double underscore is that they correspond to actual implementation of special Python syntax
- `a.__len__()` is `len(a)`
- `a.__add__(b)` is `a + b`
- etc

Do you have an actual reference for why we have to switch fron one to two underscores?

Do you have a reference for that? There is something about underscores in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id36) but, after reading it, I still don't know which underscore style to use. And the Sage `_foo_` style doesn't even exist for PEP 8.

There is some more in https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#reserved-classes-of-identifiers but again it's not really clear.

One could argue that `x.__pari__()` is `pari(x)` that's not really relevant.

Special methods in Python use the `__foo__` underscore style. I consider `__pari__` to be very similar in spirit to Python's `__int__` or NumPy's `__array__`. Since no PEP or Python documentation documents how to name custom special methods, I think that `__pari__` makes the most sense.

Let's look at our options:

1. `_pari_()`: not documented/used anywhere except for Sage.

2. `_pari()`: meant for *private* methods, which is not correct here. We want this method to be part of the CyPari2 public API.

3. `__pari()`: even more private, so even less applicable.

4. `__pari__()`: consistent with Python and NumPy. The only issue is that creating such names possibly goes against the Python documentation.

5. `pari()`: very simple but it doesn't make it clear that it has a special meaning. Higher chance of false positives with people using a `pari()` method for something else.

Right, but we do not have to change everything at the same time. We can do this for each interface separately. I just wanted to do this for `_pari_` now because of CyPari2.
