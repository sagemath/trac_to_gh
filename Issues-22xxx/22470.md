Special methods in Python usually have double leading and trailing underscores. For this reason, it makes sense to use `__pari__` for conversion to CyPari2.

One could argue that `x.__pari__()` is `pari(x)` that's not really relevant.

Special methods in Python use the `__foo__` underscore style. I consider `__pari__` to be very similar in spirit to Python's `__int__` or NumPy's `__array__`. Since no PEP or Python documentation documents how to name custom special methods, I think that `__pari__` makes the most sense.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Let's look at our options:

1. `_pari_()`: not documented/used anywhere except for Sage.

2. `_pari()`: meant for *private* methods, which is not correct here. We want this method to be part of the CyPari2 public API.

3. `__pari()`: even more private, so even less applicable.

4. `__pari__()`: consistent with Python and NumPy. The only issue is that creating such names possibly goes against the Python documentation.

5. `pari()`: very simple but it doesn't make it clear that it has a special meaning. Higher chance of false positives with people using a `pari()` method for something else.

Right, but we do not have to change everything at the same time. We can do this for each interface separately. I just wanted to do this for `_pari_` now because of CyPari2.
