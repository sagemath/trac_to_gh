Pynac-0.7.4 provides functionality for conversion of `factorial`, `binomial`, and Pochhammer symbols to the resp. `gamma` expression. Also it provides gamma normalization, i.e., rewriting e.g. `gamma(x-1)` and `gamma(x+2)` within one expression to `gamma(x-1)` and `(x-1)*x*(x+1)*gamma(x-1)` and subsequent rational normalization, such that fractions can be canceled.

The ticket should add the Python interface and doctests.
