Wouldn't it be better to explicitly build the cover relations by:

```sage
sage: def covers(x):
....:     SP = x.parent()
....:     for i,s in enumerate(x):
....:         for j in range(i+1, len(x)):
....:             L = list(x)
....:             L[i] = s.union(x[j])
....:             L.pop(j)
....:             yield SP(L)
....:             
sage: list(covers(x))
[{{1, 2, 5}, {3, 4}}, {{1, 3, 4}, {2, 5}}, {{1}, {2, 3, 4, 5}}]
```
That way you can use the `cover_relations=True` arg to `LatticePoset`.

You could just do

```

```
as this avoids extra processing on the poset (specifically the call to `transitive_reduction_acyclic`) and the extra conversion call. You can also replace `SP` by `S` in the internal function (and delete `SP = x.parent()`).

As you wish. This does not make so big difference anymore:

```
sage: timeit("L = Posets.SetPartitions(4)")
5 loops, best of 3: 64 ms per loop
sage: timeit("L = Posets.SetPartitions(5)")
5 loops, best of 3: 298 ms per loop
```
