Also, the doctests in `misc.cython.cython` are problematic in that they look like they're testing that function, but they're actually testing `misc.cython_c.cython_compile`.  To that end, I'm adding another doctest,

```
    Check that compiling c++ code works, when creating a local c file,
    first moving to a tempdir to avoid clutter::

        sage: import sage.misc.cython, sage.misc.temporary_file, os
        sage: d = sage.misc.temporary_file.tmp_dir()
        sage: os.chdir(d)
        sage: f = open(d+"src.pyx", 'w')
        sage: f.write("#clang C++\n"
        ....:       "from libcpp.vector cimport vector\n"
        ....:       "cdef vector[int] * v = new vector[int](4)\n")
        sage: f.close()
        sage: output = sage.misc.cython.cython(d+"src.pyx", create_local_c_file=True)
```

My understanding is that this particular 5-letter string "clang" has absolutely nothing to do with the software project named CLANG (written allcaps to disambiguate).

Please refer to the documentation of sage.misc.cython_c.cython_compile:

```
    Given a block of Cython code (as a text string), this function compiles it using a C compiler, and includes it into the global scope of the module that called this function.

    The following pragmas are available:

        clang - may be either c or c++ (or C or C++) indicating whether a C or C++ compiler should be used.
        clib - additional libraries to be linked in, the space separated list is split and passed to distutils.
        cinclude - additional directories to search for header files. The space separated list is split and passed to distutils.
        cfile - additional C or C++ files to be compiled. Also, $SAGE_ROOT is expanded, but other environment variables are not.
        cargs - additional parameters passed to the compiler

    For example:

    #clang C++
    #clib givaro
    #cinclude /usr/local/include/
    #cargs -ggdb
    #cfile foo.c

    AUTHOR: William Stein, 2006-10-31

```

Note that William wrote this code a full year before CLANG was released -- the code was working back then, without CLANG.  It should still work without CLANG.
