Pynac-0.7.3 introduces Gosper's hypergeometric summation algorithm. The ticket will implement the interface and add an extensive test file. Later tickets may call the function before delegating unsolved sums to Maxima.

Also, the WZ certificate can be computed to prove hypergeometric identities.

The test file has one test marked as known bug. Its resolution depends on handling of expressions with algebraic coefficients (i.e. manipulations of polynomials over algebraic fields).

Pynac-0.7.5 adds a crucial improvement and a faster implementation.

Depends on #22174
Depends on #22364

+Pynac-0.7.3 introduces Gosper's hypergeometric summation algorithm. The ticket will implement the interface and add an extensive test file. Later tickets may call the function before delegating unsolved sums to Maxima.
 
 The test file has three tests marked as known bug. Each of them shows an area where the implementation will have to be improved:
 - expressions with algebraic coefficients (i.e. manipulations of polynomials over algebraic fields)

Gosper summation is a subset of summation, i.e., it can handle only hypergeometric expressions (or sums of such). If one wants to use it in `sum` then if `gosper_sum` can't solve it, we would call Maxima's sum. The known bugs using Maxima's sum:

```
sage: (1 / (n^2 + sqrt(5)*n - 1)).sum(n,0,m)
-1/3*(m^3*(3*sqrt(5) - 7) - 3*m^2*(sqrt(5) - 1) - 2*m*(3*sqrt(5) - 2) - 6)/(m^3*(sqrt(5) - 3) - 3*m^2*(sqrt(5) - 1) - m*(sqrt(5) + 3) - 2)
sage: ((n*(n+a+b)*a^n*b^n)/factorial(n+a)/factorial(n+b)).sum(n,1,m)
-(a^(m + 1)*b^(m + 1)*factorial(a + 1)*factorial(b + 1) - ((a^2 + a)*b^2 + (a^2 + a)*b)*factorial(a + m)*factorial(b + m))/(factorial(a + m)*factorial(a + 1)*factorial(b + m)*factorial(b + 1))
sage: F(n, k) = binomial(n,k) * factorial(n) / factorial(k) / factorial(a-k) / f
....: actorial(a+n)
sage: (F(n+1, k) - F(n, k)).sum(k,0,m)
-sum(-(binomial(n + 1, k)*factorial(a + n)*factorial(n + 1) - binomial(n, k)*factorial(a + n + 1)*factorial(n))/(factorial(a - k)*factorial(k)), k, 0, m)/(factorial(a + n + 1)*factorial(a + n))
```
The last is clearly not solved. The first two seem correct.

I do not claim to add new functionality with this, just the starting point for speed optimizations and for Wilf-Zeilberger, which WOULD be new functionality.
