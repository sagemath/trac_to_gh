The graph of order 1 and size 0 is a tree. Euler's formula should apply:

  num_verts - num_edges + num_faces = 2

and in particular, the number of faces of that graphs should be 1.  Currently, `.faces()` returns an empty list and `.num_faces()` returns 0.

I agree that the number of faces of a graph with a single vertex should be 1 according to Euler's formula. However, I don't know which face to return. 


Another issue is the number of faces of graphs with several connected components. Indeed, the Euler's formula is `V-E+F-C=1`, where `C` is the number of connected components (see e.g.,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic#Plane_graphs).
But we have

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3) * 2
sage: G.num_faces()
4
sage: V = G.order()
sage: E = G.size()
sage: C = len(G.connected_components())
sage: F = E - V + C + 1
sage: F
3
```

For the single vertex graph, we should just return the "face" of `[]` representing everything.

For disconnected graphs, I suspect the `faces()` algorithm has a hidden assumption of connectedness. It makes it somewhat hard to define what a face is as the sphere remove the interior of the planar graphs is not homeomorphic to a disk anymore. We essentially have to insert some fake edges connecting the connected components in order to get the simplicial (well, CW is sufficient) decomposition for the faces. However, it is not clear to me there is an easy algorithm to chose which vertices of two unconnected planar graphs to add an edge to.

Disclaimer: I'm not "defining a face to be...", I'm trying to fix an issue ;)

In method `faces`, an embedding is defined as a clockwise ordering of the neighbors of each vertex.
So, when the graph is planar and that the embedding corresponds to a planar embedding of the graph, a face is a subset of **R**<sup>2</sup> surrounded by edges. However, I think we should distinguish several behaviors of these methods:
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is planar, the method starts computing a planar embedding and then determines it's faces. Actually, for `num_faces`, we don't need the embedding, it is sufficient to know if the graph is planar (and it's number of connected components).
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is **not** planar, then an error is raised
- if an embedding is given as input (or stored in the graph), none of the methods checks if it is a valid embedding of a planar graph. So we can for instance compute the "faces" of a non-planar graph like

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.is_planar()
False
sage: embedding = {v: G.neighbors(v) for v in G}
sage: G.faces(embedding)
[[(0, 1),
  (1, 2),
  (2, 3),
  (3, 4),
  (4, 9),
  (9, 6),
  (6, 1),
  (1, 0),
  (0, 4),
  (4, 3),
  (3, 8),
  (8, 5),
  (5, 0)],
 [(0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)],
 [(1, 6),
  (6, 8),
  (8, 3),
  (3, 2),
  (2, 7),
  (7, 5),
  (5, 8),
  (8, 6),
  (6, 9),
  (9, 7),
  (7, 2),
  (2, 1)]]
```
  and you can see that the reported faces may have repeated vertices...

I'm not sure what's the best solution here. In particular, we cannot use method `is_planar` to check if a graph is planar based on a combinatorial embedding as method `is_planar` calls method `genus` which itself calls method `faces`.

In the example of #comment:7, some "faces" visit more than once some vertices. The embedding is a local ordering of the neighbors (so of edges around vertices).

One could prefer to get `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 9), (9, 6), (6, 1), (1, 0)]` and `[(0, 4), (4, 3), (3, 8), (8, 5), (5, 0)]` rather than

Maybe I have misunderstood you with the repeated vertices. I was thinking you were saying that was a (potential) problem. I was thinking of doing something naïve like starting at an edge and following edges on one "side". This would give a face once we see the same edge again.
