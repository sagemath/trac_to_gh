```
The graph of order 1 and size 0 is a tree. Euler's formula should apply:

  num_verts - num_edges + num_faces = 2

and in particular, the number of faces of that graphs should be 1.  Currently, `.faces()` returns an empty list and `.num_faces()` returns 0.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I agree that the number of faces of a graph with a single vertex should be 1 according to Euler's formula. However, I don't know which face to return. 


Another issue is the number of faces of graphs with several connected components. Indeed, the Euler's formula is `V-E+F-C=1`, where `C` is the number of connected components (see e.g.,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_characteristic#Plane_graphs).
But we have

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3) * 2
sage: G.num_faces()
4
sage: V = G.order()
sage: E = G.size()
sage: C = len(G.connected_components())
sage: F = E - V + C + 1
sage: F
3
```

For the single vertex graph, we should just return the "face" of `[]` representing everything.

For disconnected graphs, I suspect the `faces()` algorithm has a hidden assumption of connectedness. It makes it somewhat hard to define what a face is as the sphere remove the interior of the planar graphs is not homeomorphic to a disk anymore. We essentially have to insert some fake edges connecting the connected components in order to get the simplicial (well, CW is sufficient) decomposition for the faces.

Disclaimer: I'm not "defining a face to be...", I'm trying to fix an issue ;)

In method `faces`, an embedding is defined as a clockwise ordering of the neighbors of each vertex.
So, when the graph is planar and that the embedding corresponds to a planar embedding of the graph, a face is a subset of **R**<sup>2</sup> surrounded by edges. However, I think we should distinguish several behaviors of these methods:
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is planar, the method starts computing a planar embedding and then determines it's faces. Actually, for `num_faces`, we don't need the embedding, it is sufficient to know if the graph is planar (and it's number of connected components).
- if no embedding is given (or stored in the graph) and that the graph is **not** planar, then an error is raised
- if an embedding is given as input (or stored in the graph), none of the methods checks if it is a valid embedding of a planar graph. So we can for instance compute the "faces" of a non-planar graph like

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: G.is_planar()
False
sage: embedding = {v: G.neighbors(v) for v in G}
sage: G.faces(embedding)

  (2, 1)]]
```
  and you can see that the reported faces may have repeated vertices...

I'm not sure what's the best solution here. In particular, we cannot use method `is_planar` to check if a graph is planar based on a combinatorial embedding as method `is_planar` calls method `genus` which itself calls method `faces`.
