The following is a bug:

```
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(SR, 3, name='M')
sage: e = M.basis('e')
sage: t = SR.var('t', domain='real')
sage: (2*e[0]).display()
2 e_0
sage: (t*e[0]).display()
0
```
The outcome of the last line should be `t e_0`. This bug arises because of the nonzero check performed to avoid displaying zero components. This check is written as `t != 0`, which returns `False`. The fix proposed in this ticket is to replace it by `not (t==0)`, which returns `True`.

It's somewhat ugly, but a necessary evil because of how symbolic works (i.e., t could be 0).
