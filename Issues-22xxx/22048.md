> my current aim is to be able to cythonize all our pyx files.

If that is really your goal, I would just implement a "fake" `cmp()` function like this:

```
cdef int cmp(x, y) except -2:
    if x == y:
        return 0
    elif x < y:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1
```

I would put it in `sage_object.pxd` where we already have various functions involving comparisons. However, I don't know exactly how we can ensure that this is only used in Python 3.

Maybe a simpler solution would be to patch Cython such that it does recognize `cmp()` in Python 3.

Ah, I see my misunderstanding, it is precisely because it is a *Python* class, not a `cdef` Cython class why `__richcmp__` is not called. So, I'm thinking that is what needs to happen: we should implement a `__eq__` and `__ne__`.

Once I introduced `__eq__` and `__ne__`, do I need to keep the `__richcmp__` or is it completely useless ?
