If that is really your goal, I would just implement a "fake" `cmp()` function like this:

```
cdef int cmp(x, y) except -2:
    if x == y:
        return 0
    elif x < y:
        return -1
    else:
        return 1
```

In which file should I put this "custom cmp" function ?

It's not "Cython" which has to implement that: it's Python who decides which comparison function to call. So, it cannot be a bug in Cython.
