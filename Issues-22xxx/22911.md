We have 2 methods for returning the loops of a (di)graph, `loops` and `loop_edges`, and one is faster than the other.

```
sage: G = Graph(10, loops=True)
sage: G.add_edges([(u,u) for u in G])
sage: %time L1 = G.loop_edges()
CPU times: user 68 µs, sys: 23 µs, total: 91 µs
Wall time: 73 µs
sage: %time L2 = G.loops()
CPU times: user 181 µs, sys: 50 µs, total: 231 µs
Wall time: 194 µs
sage: L1 == L2
True
sage: D = digraphs.DeBruijn(10,1)
sage: %time L1 = D.loop_edges()
CPU times: user 80 µs, sys: 18 µs, total: 98 µs
Wall time: 86.1 µs
sage: %time L2 = D.loops()
CPU times: user 333 µs, sys: 76 µs, total: 409 µs
Wall time: 344 µs
sage: L1 == L2
True
```
Note however that the slower (`loops`) has an extra parameter for edge labels. Let's try to clean that.

<a id='comment:1'></a>So far I have let both methods and improved the `loop_edges` method.

I don't know what's the best option:
1. deprecate one of the methods and ensure the fastest code is in the other one
2. make the slowest method an alias for the fastest one and so let both names

Any advice / opinion is welcome. Option 2 is the easiest one, but...

<a id='comment:2'></a>I would not deprecate the method, but just make `loops` and alias for `loop_edges` (with the extra parameter).

Also, while you're moving methods around in the file (something I try to avoid doing because it can create trivial conflicts easily), I would clean up the docstrings `Returns` -> `Return` and

```
- ``labels`` -- whether returned edges have labels (``(u,v,l)``) or not (``(u,v)``)
```
