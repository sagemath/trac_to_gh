The change is **required** for the transition to Python3.

Before (now), == means that both interval-numbers are exact and equal.

After, == means that both interval numbers have the same bounds.

In both cases, equality with an exact number holds only for another exact number.

For these interval-numbers, we absolutely need to get rid of the incompatible double comparison (cmp on one hand (currently lexicographic), and rich comparison (<,>,==,!=,<=,=>, currently with the semantics "all elements are related to all elements") on the other hand).

Right now "cmp" is used very deeply to make sure that objects have UniqueRepresentation or can be pickled correctly. In order for all this to work, we need to relax the richcmp behaviour of equality to match the current behaviour of equality with cmp.

An illustrating problem is the following : take an interval say (0.1,0.2). Pickle it. Load it again. According to the current rich comparison, it will not be equal to itself. This breaks **many** things.

If one of you think he can get quickly an alternative easy solution, I engage him or her to try. I can tell you that I did. IMHO, the current proposal is the least invasive solution.

`UniqueRepresentation` deals with parents. Here we are talking about elements, so I don't see the issue.

> or can be pickled correctly.

How does pickling involve `cmp()`?

> An illustrating problem is the following : take an interval say (0.1,0.2). Pickle it. Load it again. According to the current rich comparison, it will not be equal to itself.

Feature, not a bug.

> This breaks **many** things.

Like what?

This is really involved in unique representation and ComparisonById, because Number Fields (which are Parent) have embeddings (which are interval-numbers) that need to compare equal to themselves for the number fields to do the same.

For some triggered failures by using the current richcmp, see precisely this report:

So whenever you need to replace `cmp()` for intervals by rich comparison, use rich comparison on the endpoints. For example, you can replace\n\n```\ncmp(x, y) < 0\n```\nby\n\n```\nx.endpoints() < y.endpoints()\n```\n\nFor `x.endpoints() == y.endpoints()`, it makes sense to define a new method `equals()` on intervals which does this.",

Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A9):
> #22257 tells you what happens if you replace current cmp behaviour by current richcmp behaviour.

Here is a constructive suggestion: essentially, what `cmp()` does on intervals is comparing the endpoints. So whenever you need to replace `cmp()` for intervals by rich comparison, use rich comparison on the endpoints. For example, you can replace

```
cmp(x, y) < 0
```
by

```
x.endpoints() < y.endpoints()
```

For `x.endpoints() == y.endpoints()`, it makes sense to define a new method `equals()` on intervals which does this.

I think it's a massive change of behaviour which really should not be done unless you have very good reasons (so far, I haven't seen such a reason).

Probably yes.

Again, I totally agree. Still, the fact that it's painful does not mean that we should go ahead with what you propose here.

Note however that we have:

0
```
IMO this is a bug or at least a misfeature of the current `_cmp_()`, but who knows what might rely on it... (I had code that did by accident.)
