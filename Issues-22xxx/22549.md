The change is **required** for the transition to Python3.

Before (now), == means that both interval-numbers are exact and equal.

After, == means that both interval numbers have the same bounds.

In both cases, equality with an exact number holds only for another exact number.

`UniqueRepresentation` deals with parents. Here we are talking about elements, so I don't see the issue.

> or can be pickled correctly.


How does pickling involve `cmp()`?

> An illustrating problem is the following : take an interval say (0.1,0.2). Pickle it. Load it again. According to the current rich comparison, it will not be equal to itself.


Feature, not a bug.

> This breaks **many** things.

Here is a constructive suggestion: essentially, what `cmp()` does on intervals is comparing the endpoints. So whenever you need to replace `cmp()` for intervals by rich comparison, use rich comparison on the endpoints. For example, you can replace

```
cmp(x, y) < 0
```
by

```
x.endpoints() < y.endpoints()
```

For `x.endpoints() == y.endpoints()`, it makes sense to define a new method `equals()` on intervals which does this.

I think it's a massive change of behaviour which really should not be done unless you have very good reasons (so far, I haven't seen such a reason).

> Maybe most equality tests between elements of RIF should involve an exact element, no ?


Probably yes.

Again, I totally agree. Still, the fact that it's painful does not mean that we should go ahead with what you propose here.

This is simply not true:

sage: x == x
False

<a id='comment:20'></a>Indeed, I was wrong on that point. The doc of ball fields says

```
Two elements are equal if and only if they are the same object
or if both are exact and equal::
```
so that

```
sage: x=RBF(pi)
sage: x==x
True
```

Note however that we have:

```
sage: cmp(RIF(1/3), RIF('nan'))
0
```
IMO this is a bug or at least a misfeature of the current `_cmp_()`, but who knows what might rely on it... (I had code that did by accident.)
