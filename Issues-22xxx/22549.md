The change is **required** for the transition to Python3.

Before (now), == means that both interval-numbers are exact and equal.

After, == means that both interval numbers have the same bounds.

In both cases, equality with an exact number holds only for another exact number.

For these interval-numbers, we absolutely need to get rid of the incompatible double comparison (cmp on one hand (currently lexicographic), and rich comparison (<,>,==,!=,<=,=>, currently with the semantics "all elements are related to all elements") on the other hand).

Right now "cmp" is used very deeply to make sure that objects have UniqueRepresentation or can be pickled correctly. In order for all this to work, we need to relax the richcmp behaviour of equality to match the current behaviour of equality with cmp.

An illustrating problem is the following : take an interval say (0.1,0.2). Pickle it. Load it again. According to the current rich comparison, it will not be equal to itself. This breaks **many** things.

If one of you think he can get quickly an alternative easy solution, I engage him or her to try. I can tell you that I did. IMHO, the current proposal is the least invasive solution.

`UniqueRepresentation` deals with parents. Here we are talking about elements, so I don't see the issue.

> or can be pickled correctly.


How does pickling involve `cmp()`?

> An illustrating problem is the following : take an interval say (0.1,0.2). Pickle it. Load it again. According to the current rich comparison, it will not be equal to itself.


Feature, not a bug.

> This breaks **many** things.

Here is a constructive suggestion: essentially, what `cmp()` does on intervals is comparing the endpoints. So whenever you need to replace `cmp()` for intervals by rich comparison, use rich comparison on the endpoints. For example, you can replace

```
cmp(x, y) < 0
```
by

```
x.endpoints() < y.endpoints()
```

For `x.endpoints() == y.endpoints()`, it makes sense to define a new method `equals()` on intervals which does this.

Yes, guys, I understand your issues. Nevertheless, I have worked hard on the question, and this really stands in our way to python3. I do not think that this proposal is such a big change of behaviour. Maybe most equality tests between elements of RIF should involve an exact element, no ?

Transition to python3 is going to be painful, but you really appreciate that when spending a lot of time on this transition, as I did.

So far, I totally agree.

I think it's a massive change of behaviour which really should not be done unless you have very good reasons (so far, I haven't seen such a reason).

> Maybe most equality tests between elements of RIF should involve an exact element, no ?


Probably yes.

> Transition to python3 is going to be painful, but you really appreciate that when spending a lot of time on this transition, as I did.


Again, I totally agree. Still, the fact that it's painful does not mean that we should go ahead with what you propose here.

This is simply not true:

sage: x == x
False
sage: RBF(x) == RBF(x)
False

Note however that we have:

0
```
IMO this is a bug or at least a misfeature of the current `_cmp_()`, but who knows what might rely on it... (I had code that did by accident.)
