```
When we colorize the edges of an undirected graph containing a loop, the function show()
draws some extra edges. For example, the following code corresponds to the situation :

```
E=[(1,1),(1,2)]
g1 = Graph( E, loops=True, multiedges=False )
g1.show()
g1.show( edge_colors={"blue":[(2,1)]} )
```

If no loop is present, the code works correctly :

```
E=[(1,2)]
g1 = Graph( E, loops=True, multiedges=False )
g1.show()
g1.show( edge_colors={"blue":[(2,1)]} )
```

Now, if we replace (2,1) by (1,2), all the codes work.
We think that all our examples should work when using (2,1). Indeed, usually, inside an undirected graph, we can use (1,2) or (2,1)  for an edge {1,2}.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Dear Mr Chapoton, 

We found the bug during the Sage days organized in Algeria. Mr Adrien Boussicault reported the bug except that we could not commit the correction on a branch using the university network. I erroneously pushed the correction on a new branch created locally from my branch # 20014. I'm still looking in the documentation the way to fix it. I'm sorry about that.
