[The manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#command-line-tools)
is silent on the appropriate version of assembler.

However, we see quite a few reports 
of failures to build (mostly on RH and its clones like Centos) which are due to the 
installed version of as being way too old (like, 7 years old) to support the CPU properly.

What exactly should we say there in this regard?
Check that your assembler properly supports your CPU?
