Some hopefully representative examples:

```
QQi.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
Pol.<x> = QQi[]
p = x + i + 1
q = ( (8*i - 12)*x^10 + (-i + 2)*x^9 + (-i + 1)*x^8 + (-i + 7)*x^7 + (-i + 1)*x^6 + (-12*i + 2)*x^5 + (i + 1)*x^4 + (-7*i + 1)*x^3 + (2*i + 1)*x^2 + x - i - 2)
a = 42
b = QQi(42)
mat = matrix(QQi, [[1, i], [0,2]])
y = polygen(Pol, 'y')
foo = y^2 + x + 1
fl1 = 1.r
RR1 = 1.
for cmd in [
    'p*p',
    'p**5',
    'p._mul_trunc_(q, 3)',
    'p(0)',
    'q(0)',
    'p(a)',
    'p(b)',
    'q(b)',
    'q(fl1)',
    'q(RR1)',
    'q(a)',
    'q(mat)',
    'foo(x=1, y=2)',
]:
    timeit(cmd)
```

```
sage: pol = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 1000, 1000)['x'].random_element(degree=10)
sage: %timeit pol(42)
```

Results:

```

---------------------------------------
pol(42)               208 ms   202 ms
```

(Evaluations at floating-point numbers are very slow, and suffer from a small regression, due to the slowness of the generic coercion map through `CLF`.)

Edit: add up to ~0.5 µs to some of the above timings due to subsequent fixes.

Something else I noticed that probably could get us some speed is requiring *all* polynomials to have a `_new_constant_poly`. Currently only the dense ones have such a method. Shall we do that here?

Regarding `_new_constant_poly()` for sparse polynomials: I really don't think I'll have time to make further changes until Feb. 8 at best, though I'll do my best to review yours if you make some. In any case I'm happy with the current branch; you can set the ticket to positive review if you agree, assuming the patchbot doesn't find anything to complain about.

Since the failure has to do with p-adics, I suspect the reason may be that:

```
sage: Pol.<x> = Qp(5)[]
sage: pol = 1 + O(5)*x
sage: pol.degree()
0
sage: list(pol)
[1 + O(5^20), O(5)]
```
I don't know if this is intentional, nor why the implementation of p-adics take this convention. (I'd have expected `degree()` to check that the coefficients are nonzero using `__nonzero__()`, and `__nonzero__()` to return true except when its argument is *exactly* zero, like it does for some other inexact parents.)
