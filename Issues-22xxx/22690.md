```

This is preventing some tests from passing when running in a docker container without a TTY (in particular, when building the patchbot container, which always does a baseline check during the container build).

**Upstream report:** https://github.com/Singular/Sources/pull/817

Keywords: singular

Upstream: Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.
