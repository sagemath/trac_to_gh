```

This is preventing some tests from passing when running in a docker container without a TTY (in particular, when building the patchbot container, which always does a baseline check during the container build).

The version is wrong. The format is

```
UPSTREAMVERSION.pSAGEPATCHLEVEL
```

So it should be

```
4.1.0p3.p0
```
(confusing, but that's how it is)
