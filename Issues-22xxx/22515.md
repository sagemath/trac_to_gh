It never actually calls the Python method `iteritems()`, it has its own implementation for iterating over a dict. I should mention that this only works for objects of exact type `dict` (not subclasses).\n\nThis is also why `six.iteritems` (and many other `six` functions like `six.moves.range`) should be avoided in Cython: it prevents Cython from doing certain optimizations.",
