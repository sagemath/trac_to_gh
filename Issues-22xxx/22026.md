Check this:

```python
sage: assume(x, 'even')
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: simplify((-1)**x)
1
sage: x.is_integer()
False
```

At least for real numbers (or even for complex numbers), an even number should be assumed to be an integer.

This is how it works in SymPy:

```python
In [2]: x = Symbol('x', even=True)

In [3]: x.is_integer
Out[3]: True
```

Was supposed to be fixed in pynac-0.7.4. This will also work and should be doctested here:

```
sage: sage: assume(x, 'even')
....: sage: assume(x, 'real')
....: 
sage: (-1)^x
1
sage: (-gamma(pi))^x
gamma(pi)^x
```

Depends on #22219

Keywords: **is_integer, assume**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I wasn't sure if I should report this as a defect or as an enhancement.

I'll add that if one tries

```python
sage: assume(x, 'noninteger')
```
an error is raised:

```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Assumption is inconsistent
```
so "someone" knows `x` is an integer...
