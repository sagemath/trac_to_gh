Some of the doctests for BRiAl test for the exact hash value. They rely on boost::hash_combine() which is called in 
libbrial/include/polybori/routines/pbori_routines_hash.h. The implementation has changed for
boost 1.62 in the commit
https://github.com/boostorg/functional/commit/45eeb170f2b1372b4b5e52744d3c51eddb285b42

The proposed changes make the doctest more flexible. We now only check that the hashes are sane not that they are a certain exact value.

For some strange reason I think going to a new boost on OS X won't change the hash which seems bizarre has it means it is much less portable.

I haven't built a sage on OS X with boost-1.62.0+ but I have run brial's testsuite and it looks like the tests about hashes do not change between 1.58.0 and 1.65.1 so I expect the same thing to happen in sage. It seems to be an apple specific thing, I tried clang on linux and I just get the same results as with gcc.
