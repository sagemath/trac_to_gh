Some of the doctests for BRiAl test for the exact hash value. They rely on boost::hash_combine() which is called in 
libbrial/include/polybori/routines/pbori_routines_hash.h. The implementation has changed for
boost 1.62 in the commit
https://github.com/boostorg/functional/commit/45eeb170f2b1372b4b5e52744d3c51eddb285b42

The proposed changes make the doctest more flexible. We now only check that the hashes are sane not that they are a certain exact value.
