To reproduce it, run Sage in the terminal and evaluate the following code. Extra blank lines are printed before outputs as below:

```
class Foo(object):

    def __repr__(self):
        return "foo"


class Bar(object):

    def __repr__(self):
        return "bar\nbar"


sage: identity_matrix(QQ, 2)

[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: Foo()
foo
sage: Bar()

bar
bar
```

        self.prompt_end_newline = True

        if self.do_full_cache:
            tokens = self.shell.prompts.out_prompt_tokens()
            prompt_txt = ''.join(s for t, s in tokens)
            if prompt_txt and not prompt_txt.endswith('\n'):

Your patch will be redundant once the next release of IPython is incorporated to Sage. Note that the upstream patch was back ported to the current release, which means, I guess, that the fixed IPython would be available in Sage sooner than usual.

Your patch can be used as an (alternative) temporary measure to fix the issue, but should not be merged to Sage.
