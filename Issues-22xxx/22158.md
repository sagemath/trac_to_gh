```
To reproduce it, run Sage in the terminal and evaluate the following code. Extra blank lines are printed before outputs as below:

```
class Foo(object):

    def __repr__(self):
        return "foo"


class Bar(object):

    def __repr__(self):
        return "bar\nbar"


sage: identity_matrix(QQ, 2)

[1 0]
[0 1]
sage: Foo()
foo
sage: Bar()

bar
bar
```

Did you see the comment posted in the upstream discussion? We may think that the bug is in IPython than in Sage. So we need a patch for IPython. You may submit a pull request of the patch to IPython Github repo.
