Currently, the `combinatorial_automorphism_group` method in the polyhedron class returns a group isomorphic to the automorphism group of the vertex-edge graph of the polyhedron. I propose to changes two the method:

 (1) don't return a permutation group on the number `1, 2,.. self.n_vertices()`, but rather a permutation group on the actual objects (vertices of the polyhedron)

 (2) wide the functionality to not only return the automorphism group of the vertex-edge graph, but also of the vertex-facet graph.

The second improvement has the advantage that the automorphism group of the vertex-facet graph is the same as the automorphism of the face lattice. 

Since the vertex-facet graph is also used in the related `.is_combinatorially_isomorphic` method (see #22500) and it might be useful on its own, it is now a seperate function.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Thanks for the comments, Vincent!

- about the numbering: yes the vertices have their labeling from `0` to `n-1`, and also the facets of dimension `P.dim()-1` have their labeling. From this it is not quite clear to me, what the best labeling for the nodes in the vertex_facet_graph would be. if `labels=True`, we get consistent result with the `.graph` method:

```
sage: p = polytopes.associahedron(['A',2])
sage: p.graph().vertices()

[A vertex at (-1, 0),
 A vertex at (-1, 1),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (1, -1),
 A vertex at (1, 1)]
sage: p.vertex_facet_graph().vertices()

[An inequality (-1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, 1) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 0) x + 1 >= 0,
 An inequality (1, 1) x + 1 >= 0,
 A vertex at (-1, 0),
 A vertex at (-1, 1),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (1, -1),
 A vertex at (1, 1)]
```
  The reason to have the options `labels=False` is basically only for internal use by the .is_combinatorially_isomorphic method. 

- typo in the description fixed
- changed  the sentence to "decide how the nodes of the graph are labelled. Either with the original vertices/facets  of the Polyhedron or with integers."
- I have no strong opinion if this method should be public or start with an underscore, I guess there are reasons for both. (Now I removed the underscore).
