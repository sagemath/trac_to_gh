As originally reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36225/memory-leak-with-modular-symbols/

The interface from Sage to eclib introduces memory leaks since C++ objects are created but not destroyed.  In all but one place there is an appropriate dealloc method, but not for class ECModularSymbol.

Here is a list, hopefully complete, all from sage.libs.eclib:

- In `homspace.pyx`, the initializer for class ModularSymbols calls new to create a C++ homspace, which is correctly deallocated

- In `mat.pyx`, C++ matrices are created but again there is a dealloc to delete them.

- In `newforms.pyx`, the initializer for class ECModularSymbol calls new newforms() and has no dealloc method.

This one is good:

- In `mwrank.pyx` the initializer for class _Curvedata creates a C++ Curvedata via new which is correctly deallocated.  Same for class _mw with a new nw.  Same for class _two_descent and new two_descent.

In the course of fixing this some memory leaks were found in eclib resulting in a new version v20170122 which is at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170122.tar.bz2

I added #22077 and #10256 as dependencies since they  make many changes in sage.libs.eclib, but as they have missed release 7.5 (I assume) someone might consider it urgent to fix this leak before 7.5 despite that.

As far as I know, the memory leak is not something new. If the problem has existed for a while and people didn't complain, I don't consider it very urgent.

The exact test is

```

for which I cannot find explicit "del"s elsewhere. Do these get deleted? I think normally every "new" should be paired with a "del". It could be that your objects disappear into another object and that deallocating them is done as part of the deallocation of that object, but then your interface have that documented and you should only access that object via the encapsulating object.

?? it's the C++ here (createfromcurve) that could do complicated stuff. That's yours, right?

> but the difference is that thpse variables are local to the init function while the "new newforms..." is stored in self.


Cython wouldn't be able to generate "del"s for these automatically without extensive flow analysis, though: Just because the result of "new" gets assigned to a pointer variable that is local doesn't imply that the value doesn't get stored in other places as well.

In this case it does look like you should be able to at least do a `del C; del CD; del CR` without problem: their values are only used in dereferenced form `C[0],CD[0],CR[0]`.

You would know if the routines `CurveData,CurveRed,getconductor,createfromcurve` do funny stuff (especially, if they take special measures such as "del"-ing their arguments!)

It does look like Tom must have been in a rather big hurry when he wrote this wrapper, or otherwise had a deep-rooted contempt for reusing memory.

```
@fork

    E=EllipticCurve(C)
    print(E.label())
    phi=E.modular_symbol()
    sys.stdout.flush()
    
DB = CremonaDatabase()

for N in range(1,10000):

```
avoids eating up memory: on a test run, it has reached 8000 (out of 10000) and does not go over 200k according to "top".

The branch u/cremona/22164 at commit 290f045 now includes (1) addition of a missing dealloc, (2) addition of null constructors for 3 eclib classes so pointers are not needed when constructing these, and (crucially) (3) a new eclib version which fixes the memory leak.  It was also merged with 7.6.beta0.

The new eclib is at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170122.tar.bz2

There are no changes there except for the bug fix, so no chenges needed to Sage except the package version and checksum change.

I tested this with the original loop over conductors to 10000 and the memory in use was totally under control.  

Please review!

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
134024.41796875
sage: for E in cremona_curves([380,400]):
....:     M = E.modular_symbol()
sage: get_memory_usage()
134070.73046875
```

After:

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
136320.72265625
sage: for E in cremona_curves([380,400]):
....:     M = E.modular_symbol()
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
136322.546875
```

Anything showing a greater leakage will take longer (the above is just a few seconds).  If the run goes from 11 to 400 instead then the usage goes up by 49 before and 2 after.

    M = E.modular_symbol()
assert get_memory_usage(T) < 4

The value you're getting out of this will be very much dependent on the weather and the architecture you're running on, so you have to be a bit conservative in test failure to avoid too many false positives.

I remember discussing this for another application.

The best way to check that `foo()` does not leak memory is to run `foo()` a number of times and record the memory usage m<sub>i</sub> after each call of `foo()`. There is no memory leak if, for some index i, we have m<sub>i+j</sub> ≤ m<sub>i</sub> for all j = 1, ..., N (for some suitable fixed value of N like N=10).

Put in a different way: there is no memory leak if you are able to run `foo()` N times where the memory never increases beyond the initial memory usage, but allowing for a few initial calls of `foo()` where the memory is allowed to increase.

The trouble with using this general strategy is that elliptic curves are cached, so something like

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
66277.4609375
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     M = EllipticCurve('90a1').modular_symbol()
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()

```
shows nothing useful (in this run I had already created the modular symbol for this curve).  However one could use:

```
sage: from sage.libs.eclib.newforms import ECModularSymbol
```
directly.
Testing this I get the impression that there is a speed regression in the new version which needs to be looked into.  If you see the same, this will have to wait, and will be several days before I can work on it further.

First of all, the branch needs to be rebased.

Second, I'm not totally convinced by the memleak test code: the `mem2 - mem < 1` seems rather arbitrary. Although, if it passes doctests, I can accept it.

Still, I suggest to change

```
        sage: mem2-mem # random
        0.75
        sage: assert(mem2-mem < 1)
```
to

```
        sage: (mem2 - mem < 1) or (mem2 - mem)
        True
```
This use of `or` in doctests is a neat trick I learned from Robert Bradshaw: in case of failure, you will see the actual value of `mem2 - mem`.

Please add a doctest

```
sage: ECModularSymbol.__new__(ECModularSymbol)
Modular symbol with sign 0 over Rational Field attached to None
```
to show that this doesn't crash Sage.

The reason I ask this is that a non-trivial `__dealloc__` has potential to crash Sage if it makes assumptions which are not satisfied after `__new__`.

Here, there is no problem because Cython initializes `self.nfs = NULL` in `__new__` and deleting a `NULL` pointer is safe.

I was going to suggest just removing this test, but I see that Jeroen is suggesting that his earlier proposal is implemented.  Well, I am not going to promise to do that since I am busy and it already took several days work actually fixing some leaks.

This looks good.  AFter

etc ad infinitum (or 30, whichever comes first).  This is a much better test since on anothe rmachine without the new version it looks like

This suggest that in the doctest I should compare the memory usage after 1 and 10 calls rather than 0 and 10 as it is now.

The lines which take a long time are tagged # long time already!  So I suppose you mean the lines which call get_memory_usage() too?  That is hardly necessary, is it?

Yes, I mostly mean the final line `(mem2==mem) or (mem2 - mem)`

> That is hardly necessary, is it?


Technically you are right, but it looks strange to me to run the memory tests when you are *not* calling `ECModularSymbol(E)`. It is actually a bit dangerous since even running `mem = get_memory_usage()` might change the amount of memory allocated. So it would give me peace of mind to mark those tests as `# long time` too.

That's not true. There are robust ways to test memory leaks, see [comment:35]. Of course, it's more work, but it can be done. Maybe we should have some Sage infrastructure for this, say `test_memory_leak(func)` for a function `func`.
