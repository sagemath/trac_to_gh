As originally reported at https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36225/memory-leak-with-modular-symbols/

The interface from Sage to eclib introduces memory leaks since C++ objects are created but not destroyed.  In all but one place there is an appropriate dealloc method, but not for class ECModularSymbol.

Here is a list, hopefully complete, all from sage.libs.eclib:

- In `homspace.pyx`, the initializer for class ModularSymbols calls new to create a C++ homspace, which is correctly deallocated

- In `mat.pyx`, C++ matrices are created but again there is a dealloc to delete them.

- In `newforms.pyx`, the initializer for class ECModularSymbol calls new newforms() and has no dealloc method.

This one is good:

- In `mwrank.pyx` the initializer for class _Curvedata creates a C++ Curvedata via new which is correctly deallocated.  Same for class _mw with a new nw.  Same for class _two_descent and new two_descent.

In the course of fixing this some memory leaks were found in eclib resulting in a new version v20170122 which is at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170122.tar.bz2

I added #22077 and #10256 as dependencies since they  make many changes in sage.libs.eclib, but as they have missed release 7.5 (I assume) someone might consider it urgent to fix this leak before 7.5 despite that.

As far as I know, the memory leak is not something new. If the problem has existed for a while and people didn't complain, I don't consider it very urgent.

Report on test:  after adding the dealloc method to the ECModularSYmbol class in the cython file newforms.pyx, and running the loop again, the memory usage is a lot less but it still sits at 13g at the end of the loop to 10000.  There must be something else not getting cleared.

The exact test is

```
DB = CremonaDatabase()
for N in range(1,10000):
     Cs = DB.isogeny_classes(N)
     for C in Cs:
         E=EllipticCurve(C[0][0])
         print(E.label())
         phi=E.modular_symbol()

?? it's the C++ here (createfromcurve) that could do complicated stuff. That's yours, right?

> but the difference is that thpse variables are local to the init function while the "new newforms..." is stored in self.

Cython wouldn't be able to generate "del"s for these automatically without extensive flow analysis, though: Just because the result of "new" gets assigned to a pointer variable that is local doesn't imply that the value doesn't get stored in other places as well.

In this case it does look like you should be able to at least do a `del C; del CD; del CR` without problem: their values are only used in dereferenced form `C[0],CD[0],CR[0]`.

You would know if the routines `CurveData,CurveRed,getconductor,createfromcurve` do funny stuff (especially, if they take special measures such as "del"-ing their arguments!)

It does look like Tom must have been in a rather big hurry when he wrote this wrapper, or otherwise had a deep-rooted contempt for reusing memory.

I am working on fixing the leak in eclib.  Meanwhile it seems that wrapping the eclib call as follows

```
@fork
def work_on(C):
    E=EllipticCurve(C)
    print(E.label())
    phi=E.modular_symbol()
    sys.stdout.flush()
    
DB = CremonaDatabase()

for N in range(1,10000):
     Cs = DB.isogeny_classes(N)
     for C in Cs:
         work_on(C[0][0])
```
avoids eating up memory: on a test run, it has reached 8000 (out of 10000) and does not go over 200k according to "top".

Replying to [@JohnCremona](#comment:24):
> Ha ha.  If you want to be helpful, how about this:  in line 96 of https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/blob/master/libsrc/arith.cc
> in a class destructor, there is a delete command.  But according to valgrind the associated memory is not being deleted.  So I added a print statement just before the delete, and now it does delete -- and valgrind is happy.

It's hard to believe a C++ compiler would make an error with something that simple. Have you verified valgrind is right, i.e., if you run something along the lines:

```
    int i;
    primeclass *P;
    for ( i=0; i<1000000; i++){
        P = new primeclass;
        P->init(10000);
        delete P;
    };
```
do you see memory leaking? My guess would be that valgrind somehow misses the free ...

The branch u/cremona/22164 at commit 290f045 now includes (1) addition of a missing dealloc, (2) addition of null constructors for 3 eclib classes so pointers are not needed when constructing these, and (crucially) (3) a new eclib version which fixes the memory leak.  It was also merged with 7.6.beta0.

The new eclib is at http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/eclib-20170122.tar.bz2

There are no changes there except for the bug fix, so no chenges needed to Sage except the package version and checksum change.

I tested this with the original loop over conductors to 10000 and the memory in use was totally under control.  

Please review!

The best way to check that `foo()` does not leak memory is to run `foo()` a number of times and record the memory usage m<sub>i</sub> after each call of `foo()`. There is no memory leak if, for some index i, we have m<sub>i+j</sub> ≤ m<sub>i</sub> for all j = 1, ..., N (for some suitable fixed value of N like N=10).

Put in a different way: there is no memory leak if you are able to run `foo()` N times where the memory never increases beyond the initial memory usage, but allowing for a few initial calls of `foo()` where the memory is allowed to increase.

The trouble with using this general strategy is that elliptic curves are cached, so something like

```
sage: get_memory_usage()
66277.4609375
sage: for _ in range(100):
....:     M = EllipticCurve('90a1').modular_symbol()
....:     
sage: get_memory_usage()
66277.4609375
```
shows nothing useful (in this run I had already created the modular symbol for this curve).  However one could use:

```
sage: from sage.libs.eclib.newforms import ECModularSymbol
```
directly.
Testing this I get the impression that there is a speed regression in the new version which needs to be looked into.  If you see the same, this will have to wait, and will be several days before I can work on it further.

<div id="comment:43" align="right">comment:43</div>

First of all, the branch needs to be rebased.

Second, I'm not totally convinced by the memleak test code: the `mem2 - mem < 1` seems rather arbitrary. Although, if it passes doctests, I can accept it.

Still, I suggest to change

```
        sage: mem2-mem # random
        0.75
        sage: assert(mem2-mem < 1)
```
to

```
        sage: (mem2 - mem < 1) or (mem2 - mem)
        True
```
This use of `or` in doctests is a neat trick I learned from Robert Bradshaw: in case of failure, you will see the actual value of `mem2 - mem`.

Please add a doctest

```
sage: ECModularSymbol.__new__(ECModularSymbol)
Modular symbol with sign 0 over Rational Field attached to None
```
to show that this doesn't crash Sage.

The reason I ask this is that a non-trivial `__dealloc__` has potential to crash Sage if it makes assumptions which are not satisfied after `__new__`.

Here, there is no problem because Cython initializes `self.nfs = NULL` in `__new__` and deleting a `NULL` pointer is safe.

This suggest that in the doctest I should compare the memory usage after 1 and 10 calls rather than 0 and 10 as it is now.

What a pain.  I don't use Macs.  I do not test eclib on Macs.  If someone told me tomorrow that eclib does no longer work on some Mac system I would do absolutely nothing about it except possibly to put a warning into its documentation and wait for someone else to fix it.  Ditto cygwin.  Ditto clang, whatever that is.

It took quite a long time to track down the leak and fix it.  It has taken far longer to write a doctest which keeps people happier -- still not finished with that.  It is *obvious* that the memory used will be machine dependent, hance *stupid* to have a doctest which relies on some measure of memory.  The only sensible measure is to compare the amount of memroy in use before and after the patch, one the same machine, and the doctesting system cannot do that.

Please can we delete this doctest entirely?  It is in any case not testing that part of Sage works, only that part  of one of its dependencies does.  If that would get this into 7.6 that would be worth something.

I will delete the doctest.  That is absolutely the last contribution I will make to this ticket.

That's not true. There are robust ways to test memory leaks, see [comment:35]. Of course, it's more work, but it can be done. Maybe we should have some Sage infrastructure for this, say `test_memory_leak(func)` for a function `func`.

Fine for me. It will allow this ticket to finally move forward.
