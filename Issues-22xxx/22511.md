It's a standard package, so it will be built. It just won't be used by anything.

An assembler that outputs object code, just a build tool? We have different opinions.  

Anyway since it is to be a standard package we should at least test if it builds on non-x86 architectures where it cannot be used anyway. I am not sure if it could pass its test suite on arm or ppc64. May be we need to do something more subtle in configure.

Is it really problematic?
Remember that at the moment we ship GIAC which is completely broken outside x86*...

You can still modify spkg-check to disable testing on non-x86* if you want.

You mean, just like a compiler ;)

It is true that at the moment we are borked out on ppc64 and arm64 so it doesn't matter so much I guess.
