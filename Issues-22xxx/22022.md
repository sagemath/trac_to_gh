Check this:

```python
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: bool(floor(x) <= x)
False
```

This is how it works in Sympy:

```python
In [2]: x = Symbol('x', real=True)

In [3]: floor(x) <= x
Out[3]: True

In [4]: floor(x) >= x
Out[4]: floor(x) >= x

In [5]: floor(x) > x
Out[5]: False
```

Component: **symbolics**

Keywords: **floor, ceil**

Clearly, a similar idea should probably work for `ceil`.

I am interested in solving this. How do I solve this?(Implementation). Do I need to change the function body in expression.pyx here?

You need to know about how symbolic expressions are implemented in Sage. The Python interface uses the Pynac library for fast manipulation. Pynac is C++ and that's also why the expression member functions are often in Cython. Now `bool(expression)` calls the `__nonzero__()` member function where both Pynac and Maxima are used to determine the truth value---more or less successfully.

Now recognizing that `floor(x)<x` is true could be easy but what about `4*floor<4*x`? Or even `4*y*floor(x)<4*y` with `assume(y>0)`? As you don't want simple text recogition you need a system that can solve whole classes of such expressions, see #19000. The interface to it would be in ticket #19162. It seems possible with much less work to get some of the functionality in Pynac, see the tickets https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/227 and https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/234.

Because this all is quite far away I have marked this ticket as "on the wishlist".
