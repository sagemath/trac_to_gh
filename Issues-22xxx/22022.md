Check this:

```python
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: bool(floor(x) <= x)
False
```

This is how it works in Sympy:

```python
In [2]: x = Symbol('x', real=True)

In [3]: floor(x) <= x
Out[3]: True

In [4]: floor(x) >= x
Out[4]: floor(x) >= x

In [5]: floor(x) > x
Out[5]: False
```

**Keywords:** floor, ceil

Clearly, a similar idea should probably work for `ceil`.

I am interested in solving this. How do I solve this?(Implementation). Do I need to change the function body in expression.pyx here?

You need to know about how symbolic expressions are implemented in Sage. The Python interface uses the Pynac library for fast manipulation.

Because this all is quite far away I have marked this ticket as "on the wishlist".
