The method image_of_hecke_algebra computes the image by starting with the zero subspace and adding hecke operators until the sturm bound.

This patch speeds up this method significantly by checking at each step whether the current module is the full endomorphism ring by checking to see if it is of maximal rank and is saturated. This method is already referenced in the current code but was never actually implemented.

The speedup should be evident in most modular abelian varieties of dimension greater than 1.

I also checked this is against the old code. I broke the caching by commenting out lines 956-959 and then ran this code on a big computer.

```
from sage.all import *
from itertools import product
 
 
@parallel(40)
def test_at_level(N, j):
    if j == 0:
        J = J0(N)
    else:
        J = J1(N)
 
    R = J.endomorphism_ring()
    A = R.image_of_hecke_algebra(check_every=0)
    B = R.image_of_hecke_algebra(check_every=1)
 
    return [x.matrix() for x in A.gens()] == \
            [x.matrix() for x in B.gens()]
 
Ns = range(1,26)
js = [0,1]
tests = list(product(Ns,js))
 
test_results = list(test_at_level(tests))
print("Number of tests: {}".format(len(test_results)))
if all([x[1] for x in test_results]):
    print("Passed")
