A minor improvement split off from #15601.  This makes the method `PowerSeries._pari_()` slightly more efficient, and also makes it accept power series with infinite precision (by converting them to PARI `t_POL` instead of `t_SER`).

Depends on #22216

If PARI doesn't care so much about the difference between a polynomial and a series (I don't really know how PARI deals with these things), then LGTM and you can set a positive review.

Thanks.  In PARI, polynomials and power series can be mixed easily, just like in Sage polynomial rings coerce into power series rings.  In fact, power series with infinite precision are implemented in #15601 using PARI polynomials.
