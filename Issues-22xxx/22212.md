A minor improvement split off from #15601.  This makes the method `PowerSeries._pari_()` slightly more efficient, and also makes it accept power series with infinite precision (by converting them to PARI `t_POL` instead of `t_SER`).

Depends on #22216

If PARI doesn't care so much about the difference between a polynomial and a series (I don't really know how PARI deals with these things), then LGTM and you can set a positive review.
