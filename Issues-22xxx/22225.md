Martin, you reviewed #20058 and so may be interested in this too. The code should work, but I am currently compiling it on a slow machine.

What you think about function name, parameter names and examples? I am not very satisfied, but don't know what would be better.

True. I'll do.

Should `element_constructor` be `element_labels`? Should I have `C` or `T` (from `\Theta`) as first parameter? `'integer'` or `'integers'`? I feel that there is no natural and clear naming. Might be because I don't write in my native language.

I would change the docstring to

```
        Return the quotient lattice by ``congruence``.

        Let `L` be a lattice and `\Theta` be a congruence of `L` with
        congurence classes `\Theta_1, \Theta_2, \ldots`. The quotient
        lattice `L/\Theta` is the lattice with elements
        `\{\Theta_1, \Theta_2, \ldots\}` and meet and join given by the
        original lattice. Explicitly, if `e_1 \in \Theta_1` and
        `e_2 \in \Theta_2`, such that `e_1 \vee e_2 \in \Theta_3` then
        `\Theta_1 \vee \Theta_2 = \Theta_3` in `L/\Theta` and similarly
        for meets.

        INPUT:

        - ``congruence`` -- list of lists; a congruence

        - ``element_constructor`` -- string; the elements of the resulting
          lattice and can be one of the following:

          * ``'tuple'`` - elements are tuples of elements of the original
            lattice
          * ``'lattice'`` - elements are sublattices of the original lattice
          * ``'integer'`` - elements are labeled by integers

        .. WARNING::

            ``congruence`` is expected to be a valid congruence of the
            lattice. This is *not* checked.
```
I would also change `element_constructor` to `element_labels` as the former suggests it allows a function valid input.

I would like to have as few `WARNING`s as possible. Can we avoid that by requiring the input to be of type SetPartition? And/or `rename()` the set partition given by `congruence()`? Then the user would really need to break things to get an error.

Or do we break something if we just put extra value `._congruence_base_lattice` pointing to the lattice to a `SetPartition`-object? Of course that would cost some extra bytes for every congruence.

Then you need to check that your input is a valid congruence.

> Can we avoid that by requiring the input to be of type SetPartition? And/or `rename()` the set partition given by `congruence()`? Then the user would really need to break things to get an error.

I don't see anything in the code that assumes it is an instance of `SetPartition`. So I don't understand what you're trying to get at here. Although I suspect it is not the issue.

> Or do we break something if we just put extra value `._congruence_base_lattice` pointing to the lattice to a `SetPartition`-object? Of course that would cost some extra bytes for every congruence.

I'm not sure what you mean here.

Looks good.  Here is a test you might enjoy:

```
sage: n=6
sage: d = {pi: pi.inverse().descents(from_zero=False) for pi in Permutations(n)}
sage: C = [[pi for pi in d if d[pi]==des] for des in d.values()]
sage: L = LatticePoset(Posets.SymmetricGroupWeakOrderPoset(n))
sage: M = L.quotient(L.congruence(C))
sage: M.is_isomorphic(Posets.BooleanLattice(n-1))
True
```

Unfortunately, this won't work out of the box, because `Posets.SymmetricGroupWeakOrderPoset(n)` creates strange labels.  Also it should be possible to replace `L.congruence(C)` with just `SetPartition(C)`, but there is a bug (#22361).

Anyway, I think this is great!
