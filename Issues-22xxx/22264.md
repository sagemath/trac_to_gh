There are a number of things that could use some polish. This is just to fix the issues I see.

```
The *minimal burning configuration* is the one with the minimal script (its
components are no larger than the components of any other script for a burning
configuration).
```

Does the "no larger" mean "less or equal", or does it really mean "not larger"? (Due to the tacit all-quantor here, this makes a difference.)

```
The following are equivalent for a configuration `c` with burning
configuration `b` having script `\sigma`:

- `c` is recurrent;
- `c + b` stabilizes to `c`;
- the firing vector for the stabilization of `c + b` is `\sigma`.
```
Am I seeing it right that the b has nothing to do with c? Because the "with" suggests that it does, but I'm not sure what...

Two things I see from a quick look:

- Instead of `\mathbb{Z`} use `\ZZ`.
- I think `every vertex is accessible from some vertex in its support.` is ambiguous, in contrast saying there is a path.

For [comment:5](#comment%3A5). I don't see the difference since I am interpreting it as something compared component-by-component. My guess is that `b` is related to `c` by the underlying graph. So they are not quite completely separate.

Thanks! The "accessible" is defined further above in that .rst file, so I thought it makes sense. But I'll add both wordings.

Yes, b and c have nothing to do with each other, as I've just found out from http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/cklivans/Dynkin.pdf . And the "no larger" is indeed componentwise (Theorem 2.28 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.6163.pdf ). I will clarify these tomorrow when I am back on a Linux machine.

I don't understand what `is_alive` does (the example isn't definitive here). The doc is also not quite clear (what is "the resulting cycle"?).

Also, how can this be true?

```
The *zero set* for the sandpile ideal `I` is

.. MATH::

    Z(I) = \{p\in\CC^n: f(p)=0\mbox{ for all $f\in I$}\},

the set of simultaneous zeros of the polynomials in `I`.  Letting `S^1` denote
the unit circle in the complex plane, `Z(I)` is a finite
subgroup of `S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1 \subset \CC^n`
```
The circle `S^1` is not a subvariety of `\CC` in the sense of algebraic geometry over `\CC`...

Does this mean the docbuilder doesn't look for references in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`? Every time I think Sphinx cannot get any more stupid I get proven wrong.

Anyway, I've added the reference to the local bibliography. It should work now.
