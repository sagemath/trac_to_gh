This patch will change Poincare to Poincaré in docstrings. This does not change class names, as Python allows only ascii in identifiers, and does not change object names as it may later break doctesting. (Exception: one place is already handled in #22734.)

I have prefilled reviewer name by a man with `é` in his name. `:=)`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>To say it once again,

```
+ name=u'Poincaré Disk Model', short_name="PD",
```
and

```
+ name='Triangulation of the Poincaré homology 3-sphere')
```
are changes that we are potentially not ready to handle, and that should rather wait until a fully-utf8-aware doctesting framework is ready.

I am not happy about that, but I would prefer to be very cautious for the moment.
