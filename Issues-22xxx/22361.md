`SetPartition([[1,2],[2,3]])` gives `AssertionError`. It should give `ValueError` with a meaningful exception string.

(Original example below.)

This code produces an assertion error:

```
sage: n=3
sage: d = {pi: pi.descents(from_zero=False) for pi in Permutations(n)}
sage: C = [[pi for pi in d if d[pi]==des] for des in d.values()]
sage: SetPartition(C)
...
sage-develop/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/set_partition.pyc in check(self)
    152             sage: s.check()
    153         """
--> 154         assert self in self.parent()
    155 
    156     def __hash__(self):

AssertionError: 
```
Although after looking twice the reason for the error is clear, it would be good to have a more helpful error message, indicating that there were duplicate elements, etc.

Your `C` is unhashable. Compare `SetPartition([[(1,2),(3,4)],[(5,6)]]` and `SetPartition([[[1,2],[3,4]],[This is the Trac macro *5,6* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#5,6-macro)])`; tuples are immutable, lists are mutable.

Anyways, the error message should be better.

Change milestone to sage-invalid/duplicate/wontfix and put to needs review -state. I can then mark as positive review.

But I think you found a kind of bug. Why was the error message like what you get?

Minor correction: since `SetPartition([[pi] for pi in Permutations(3)])` works, I think that `SetPartitions` is what it promises to be.

Thus, I think the difficulty is rather to have `check` do something more fine grained than `self in self.parent()`.

If I understand correctly, `self in self.parent()` is shorthand for `self.parent().__contains__(self)` which does all the right checks, but only returns `True` or `False`.

So, the quick fix is to copy all these checks into `check`.  However, this is duplication of code.

Very strong -1.

The check is not the problem. The main problem that generates this error is the allowable data structures to construct elements:

```
sage: SetPartition(set(map(Set, C)))
{{[1, 2, 3]}, {[1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 1]}, {[2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 2]}, {[3, 2, 1]}}
```
The `__contains__` fails (as it should) because a list is not a set.

However, there is another potential issue with the containment check not being strict enough because the set partition corresponding to, e.g., `C` is not in the enumerated set. I'm okay with `SetPartitions()` being a generic parent, but it is technically wrong that `set(map(Set, C)) in SetPartitions()`. Fixing this means we need to be more specific about the parent that `SetPartition.__classcall_private__` constructs.

Edit - +1 to changing to raising `ValueError`.

I moved the check into `SetPartition.check`.  So, the check is performed when "untrusted" code creates a set partition.

Why is this going in the wrong direction?

1) `x in SetPartitions(17)` should simply check whether the parent is correct.  That is, `__contains__` should *not* be overwritten.

2) For each kind of set partition, we need to implement `check`, which should throw an error, if the argument is not good.  To make this work, `check` should actually be implemented in the parent class.  Is this impossible or undesirable?
