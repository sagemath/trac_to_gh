If the sqlite3 development fails are installed system-wide (e.g. `sqlite3.h` is found in `/usr/include`) then the build can fail like:

```

followed by several hundred lines of similar symbol resolution failures.

The issue seems to be that if `/usr/include/sqlite.h` is found, it is inserting `-L/usr/lib` earlier than `-L.` in the link flags, and the result is that `/usr/lib/libpythonX.Y` is linked against, rather than the `libpythonX.Y` that was just built.

The same happens with ncurses *specifically* on Python 3 (but not Python 2, it seems).  An intermediate workaround is to simply not install the `-devel` packages for sqlite3 or libncurses in a Cygwin that Sage will be built in.

I've only reproduced this issue on Cygwin, but I don't see anything Cygwin specific about it immediately.

A related issue is the fact that the build is considered successful.  We should figure out how to make it fail if an "optional" extension module that we need fails to build; see #22776

Upstream: **Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.**

Component: **porting: Cygwin**

 /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage-cygwin/local/var/tmp/sage/build/python2-2.7.13.p0/src/Modules/_sqlite/cache.c:38:(.text+0x4b): relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_PC32 against undefined symbol `__imp__Py_RefTotal'
 ```
 
-followed by several hundred lines of similar symbol resolution failures.  This only started with 2.7.13, ~~and was not a problem on 2.7.12~~ it appears to be a problem on 2.7.12 as well. I must have been tired/misinterpreting last time I tried it.
+followed by several hundred lines of similar symbol resolution failures.
 
-A related issue is the fact that the build is considered successful.  We should figure out how to make it fail if an "optional" extension module that we need fails to build.  Not sure yet exactly how to make it do that.
+The issue seems to be that if `/usr/include/sqlite.h` is found, it is inserting `-L/usr/lib` earlier than `-L.` in the link flags, and the result is that `/usr/lib/libpythonX.Y` is linked against, rather than the `libpythonX.Y` that was just built.
 
-Will investigate what changed between ~~2.7.12~~ 2.7.?? and 2.7.13 to make the sqlite module build fail.
+I've only reproduced this issue on Cygwin, but I don't see anything Cygwin specific about it immediately.
