If the sqlite3 development fails are installed system-wide (e.g. `sqlite3.h` is found in `/usr/include`) then the build can fail like:

```

followed by several hundred lines of similar symbol resolution failures.

The issue seems to be that if `/usr/include/sqlite.h` is found, it is inserting `-L/usr/lib` earlier than `-L.` in the link flags, and the result is that `/usr/lib/libpythonX.Y` is linked against, rather than the `libpythonX.Y` that was just built.

The same happens with ncurses *specifically* on Python 3 (but not Python 2, it seems).  An intermediate workaround is to simply not install the `-devel` packages for sqlite3 or libncurses in a Cygwin that Sage will be built in.

I've only reproduced this issue on Cygwin, but I don't see anything Cygwin specific about it immediately.

A related issue is the fact that the build is considered successful.  We should figure out how to make it fail if an "optional" extension module that we need fails to build; see #22776

**Upstream:** Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.

 I've only reproduced this issue on Cygwin, but I don't see anything Cygwin specific about it immediately.
