Similar to #22482, another semi-random test failure I get when running sage -t -a -p 0 in the develop Docker container (off a current version of the develop branch) is:

```
sage -t /opt/sage/src/sage/libs/gap/all_documented_functions.py
    [4 tests, 105.48 s]
sage -t /opt/sage/src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py
**********************************************************************
File "/opt/sage/src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py", line 59, in sage.libs.gap.assigned_names.load_or_compute
Failed example:
    workspace(name='globals')
Expected:
    ('...', True)
Got:
    ('/home/sage/.sage/gap/libgap-globals-5920393023770190458', False)
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   5 in sage.libs.gap.assigned_names.load_or_compute
    [15 tests, 1 failure, 105.33 s]
```

This one usually happens the first time I run the tests after a fresh build, but never subsequently.  It doesn't seem to always happen though.
