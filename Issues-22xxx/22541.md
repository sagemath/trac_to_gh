```
If I run "make" in Sage, it creates some *.pyc files in src/sage:

```
$ find src/sage -name "*.pyc" -print
./__init__.pyc
./env.pyc
./misc/__init__.pyc
./misc/lazy_import_cache.pyc
./misc/package.pyc
./repl/__init__.pyc
./repl/ipython_kernel/__init__.pyc
./repl/ipython_kernel/install.pyc
./version.pyc
```
This is presumably a bug.
