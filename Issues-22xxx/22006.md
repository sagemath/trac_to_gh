Here is the problem: if i build `cbc` on a machine where `libopenblas-base` is not installed, cbc works fine. Now, if i install `libopenblas-base`, i got:

```
from sage.numerical.backends.coin_backend import CoinBackend
ImportError: /usr/lib/libblas.so.3: undefined symbol: sgemv_thread_n
```

I do not understand why cbc tries to use system's blas at runtime while Sage already provides one.

Remark: if `libopenblas-dev` is installed when `cbc` is built, there is no problem, even if i remove `libopenblas-base` during runtime.
