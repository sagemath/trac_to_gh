Now that some functionality of specific orthogonal polys is handled by other than pexpect calls (?, see #17753) let's replace the unneeded calls completely.

There seems to be no reason to preserve the functionality `func._maxima_init_evaled_(args)` because the same can be had with `maxima(func(args, hold=True))` which is also intuitive.

The ticket will also remove pexpect calls from `OrthogonalPoly`.
