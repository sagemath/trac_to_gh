```
The test suite of `src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py` takes an infinite amount of time. 

The responsible doctest is

```
(line 1924):    TestSuite(TransitiveGroups()).run()
```
And it is blocked because of

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: elt = T.an_element()
sage: T(elt)     # hangs
```
This comes from #22382.

`T.an_element()` works. What doesn't work is creating an element of T from an element of T.

The traceback after <Ctrl-c> pointed me to these lines:

```
/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/sets/disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py in _element_constructor_facade(self, el)
    575             return el
    576 
--> 577         for P in self._family:
    578             try:
    579                 return P(el)
```
sage: T._family
Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
}}}

It is an infinite family - of course it hangs.

Obvious solution: First check whether the parent of the given element belongs to the family.  But alas, the element of T has no reasonable parent at all. I get the following rather strange sequence of lines:

```
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: t.parent() in T._family
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     71         return type(x)
     72     else:

     74 
     75

sage: t

sage: t.parent()

```

No idea how to fix that, though.

Better do it the other way around because all the discussion is happening here.

Well, the comments were not clear either. It was not obvious to me that the "this" from [comment:8] was referring not the bug on this ticket.

OK, so we need to deal with `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` issue. As Jeroen rightly says on #22570, this cannot be done by `spkg-install`, as it updates user-specific
stuff in `~/.sage/gap/`. 

What else can be done? I only see an option of `sage` checking
on startup whether  `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` must be run.
Can we get away with only triggering it if a new Sage package was installed?
(otherwise this looks like a time-consuming check).

Docs on how to install GAP packages manually should also
indicate the need to run `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` after
a GAP package is installed or removed.

Answering my own question: yes, the following still hangs:

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: T(t)
