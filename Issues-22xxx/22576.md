The test suite of `src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py` takes an infinite amount of time. 

The responsible doctest is

```
(line 1924):    TestSuite(TransitiveGroups()).run()
```
And it is blocked because of

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: elt = T.an_element()
sage: T(elt)     # hangs
```
This comes from #22382.

`T.an_element()` works. What doesn't work is creating an element of T from an element of T.

The traceback after <Ctrl-c> pointed me to these lines:

```
/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/sets/disjoint_union_enumerated_sets.py in _element_constructor_facade(self, el)
    575             return el
    576 
--> 577         for P in self._family:
    578             try:
    579                 return P(el)
```
sage: T._family
Lazy family (<lambda>(i))_{i in Non negative integers}
}}}

It is an infinite family - of course it hangs.

Obvious solution: First check whether the parent of the given element belongs to the family.  But alas, the element of T has no reasonable parent at all. I get the following rather strange sequence of lines:

```
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: t.parent() in T._family
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     71         return type(x)
     72     else:

     74 
     75 

TypeError: descriptor 'parent' of 'sage.structure.sage_object.SageObject' object needs an argument
sage: t
Transitive group number 1 of degree 0
sage: t.parent()

```

No idea how to fix that, though.

OK, so we need to deal with `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` issue. As Jeroen rightly says on #22570, this cannot be done by `spkg-install`, as it updates user-specific
stuff in `~/.sage/gap/`. 

What else can be done? I only see an option of `sage` checking
on startup whether  `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` must be run.
Can we get away with only triggering it if a new Sage package was installed?
(otherwise this looks like a time-consuming check).

Docs on how to install GAP packages manually should also
indicate the need to run `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` after
a GAP package is installed or removed.

Answering my own question: yes, the following still hangs:

```
sage: T = TransitiveGroups()
sage: t = T.an_element()
sage: T(t)
