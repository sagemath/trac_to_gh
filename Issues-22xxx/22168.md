Should have Sage give an error if you define a quantum shuffle algebra that doesn't make sense, such as:

Q = QuantumShuffleAlgebra('abcdghi', CartanMatrix(['A',3]))

Right now, it let me define the above, but then when I applied a function, it gave an uninformative error.

I've removed the inheritance of `ShuffleAlgebra` because `ShuffleAlgebra` has a bialgebra structure and I don't think that structure naturally lifts to the quantum setting (at least without some modification, but some quick searching didn't yield anything). I also fixed another issues with multiplication returning basis elements indexed by strings instead of words. Improvements were made to the string representations too.

However, there is still more work needed on the documentation, in particular, precisely defining/stating the multiplication in the doc.
