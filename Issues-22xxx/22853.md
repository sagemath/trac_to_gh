<a id='comment:8'></a>I specifically chose 500 because the 300px images were difficult to see. I tried 400 as well before settling on 500.

An idea, which I couldn't find, I wanted to see if there's a way to limit the height by cropping instead of stretching. It looks like sphinx_plot always returns a square image, so when adding

`:height: 200 px`

or something we get a shrunk image which still has pointless whitespace. I couldn't find anything in the documentation about cropping, but if you do know of a way to crop, it'd be nice as some of the images definitely take up a lot of vertical room and would be nice to shrink them.

Alternatively, I can reduce the size to 300px as is more standard with the knowledge that some images may be difficult to see. (Note the main difficulty in seeing the images was the words/symbols on the images, so I can potentially reduce the size as well if we don't care about being able to read labels on the images)

<a id='comment:16'></a>I downloaded and tested on my machine as well. After doing both a distclean and a doc-clean and then makeing sage again I was not able to reproduce the error. 

Additionally, I looked at the error given by Volker, in particular:

This line suggests to me that the problem exists in the class PlotOptions in the method color. This method was NOT altered. In fact, running a git blame shows that the code here has not changed since 2016 (and most of it not being changed since 2013)

<a id='comment:42'></a>The problem is this test/plot:

```
    sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sage: L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=85/100) # long time
    Graphics3d Object

.. PLOT::
    :width: 300 px

    L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
    sphinx_plot(L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=85/100))
```
I also now know why it fails and can reproduce it in a Sage session:

```
sage: L = RootSystem(["A",3,1]).ambient_space()
sage: p = L.plot(reflection_hyperplanes=False, bounding_box=int(85)/int(100))
sage: p.tachyon()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: reduce() of empty sequence with no initial value
```
There is no Sage preprocessor run, so the bounding box gets evaluated to 0, which in turn, creates an empty `Graphics3dGroup`, which causes the `reduce` to fail:

```
sage: g = p.all[9]   # I think this will be the same for all, but not sure
sage: g.all
[]
```
This is now #23200. This is not a dependency as the correct picture should be plotted, which means the bounding box should be a rational number, meaning we never get the empty `Graphics3dGroup` (and generates the correct picture). I verified this last commit fixes the problem on the buildbot where it didn't work before.

That does not quite explain why we could not reproduce this failure locally, but it does explain everything else. I'm not going to bother with this last detail.
