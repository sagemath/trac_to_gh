numpy now has its own `complex.h` header, which conflics with cephes' one on FreeBSD. So we should not include it on FreeBSD.

Why only on freeBSD? If there is a conflicting header, it will exist on other OSes too.

And for consistency use 4 spaces for indentation, also in shell scripts.

No, this is the cephes header, only installed on FreeBSD.

I'll fix this, sure, no problem.

But numpy's spkg-install unsets CFLAGS, cf lines 55-56:

```
# Program around a bug in SciPY's distutils.
unset CFLAGS
```
Thus I modify CC.

I don't think you should *assume* that cephes is only installed on FreeBSD. Adding the macro doesn't hurt if cephes is not installed, so why not play it safe?

I've made adding this flag unconditional, as you suggest, and bumped up the version to p1.

There are more places in the spkg-install that add stuff to `CC`, so cleaning this up is beyond the modest scope of this ticket.

You mean the `SAGE64` stuff? First of all, for `-m64` it actually does make sense to add it to `CC` (as it applies to the all of the toolchain, from compiler to linker). Second, nobody uses `SAGE64`, so it's not really relevant anyway.

The `unset CFLAGS` dates from 2008, so it's likely no longer relevant.
