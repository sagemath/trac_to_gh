numpy now has its own `complex.h` header, which conflics with cephes' one on FreeBSD. So we should not include it on FreeBSD.

No, this is the cephes header, only installed on FreeBSD.

But numpy's spkg-install unsets CFLAGS, cf lines 55-56:

```
# Program around a bug in SciPY's distutils.
unset CFLAGS
```
Thus I modify CC.

You mean the `SAGE64` stuff? First of all, for `-m64` it actually does make sense to add it to `CC` (as it applies to the all of the toolchain, from compiler to linker). Second, nobody uses `SAGE64`, so it's not really relevant anyway.

The `unset CFLAGS` dates from 2008, so it's likely no longer relevant.
