numpy now has its own `complex.h` header, which conflics with cephes' one on FreeBSD. So we should not include it on FreeBSD.

No, this is the cephes header, only installed on FreeBSD.

I'll fix this, sure, no problem.

But numpy's spkg-install unsets CFLAGS, cf lines 55-56:

```
# Program around a bug in SciPY's distutils.
unset CFLAGS
```
Thus I modify CC.

You mean the `SAGE64` stuff? First of all, for `-m64` it actually does make sense to add it to `CC` (as it applies to the all of the toolchain, from compiler to linker). Second, nobody uses `SAGE64`, so it's not really relevant anyway.

The `unset CFLAGS` dates from 2008, so it's likely no longer relevant.
