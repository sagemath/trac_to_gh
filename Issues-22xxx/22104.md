The algorithm for square roots mod 2<sup>n</sup> is the most naive one

```
# TODO: implement something that isn't totally idiotic.
for x in a.parent():
    if x**2 == a:
        return x
```
(see lines 3723-3776 of `sage/finite_rings/integer_mod.pyx`).

We implement a straightforward algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
