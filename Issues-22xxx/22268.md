```
The copy function for scheme points does not actually produce a copy of the coords. So if you change a value of the coordinates it changes both the point and the copy.

```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,1)
sage: Q=P(152,113)
sage: copy(Q) is Q
False
sage: copy(Q)._coords is Q._coords
True
```

The last output should also be false.

As a user I would not even expect the coordinates of P to change, since P advertises having a well-defined hash.

However, I see that `scale_by` and `normalize_coordinates` do not change the equality or hash of the point. So those are sort-of OK.

If you just change `Q._coords` to a tuple, you'd be done (after fixing the resulting failures). A tuple should be more efficient here anyway.
