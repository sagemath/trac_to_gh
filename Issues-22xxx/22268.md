```
The copy function for scheme points does not actually produce a copy of the coords. So if you change a value of the coordinates it changes both the point and the copy.

```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,1)
sage: Q=P(152,113)
sage: copy(Q) is Q
False
sage: copy(Q)._coords is Q._coords
True
```

The last output should also be false.

Merged.

However, I'm getting a test failure in projective_morphism that is unrelated to this change. It seems that this fails for me in 7.6.beta2 also.

```
File "src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_morphism.py", line 853, in sage.schemes.projective.projective_morphism.SchemeMorphism_polynomial_projective_space.dynatomic_polynomial
Failed example:
    f.dynatomic_polynomial(2)
Expected:
    2.00000000000000*x^2 + 0.999999999999999*y^2
Got:
    0.666666666666667*x^2 + 0.333333333333333*y^2
```

Looking at the doctest, both the 'Expected' value and the 'Got' value are actually wrong. There is already a ticket open for fixing some other dynatomic polynomial issues, so I'll add this failure there.

What is happening in that example is that the quo_rem fails to return a nonzero reminder, so then maxima is tried. The division in maxima (line 964) is not checked to see if the remainder is zero (which it is not).

This example is unable to be exactly divided, so it should return the rational function.

This is not really an issue. Points are hashable, so `copy(Q) is Q` wouldn't even be a problem. Once you start changing coordinates, you're already in undefined territory (it's an "_" attribute for a reason ...):

```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,1)
sage: Q=P(1,2)
sage: hash(Q)
-6819944855328768534
sage: Q._coords[1]=0
sage: hash(Q)

```
Hashable means immutable; certainly immutable as far as the hash value is concerned.

I understand your point in theory, but I think in practice this is not the case.

As user, if I create a point P in projective space. Then make a copy Q=copy(P). Then scale the coordinates of P by some value P.scale_by(2) or P.normalize_coordinates(). I do not expect the coordinates of Q to also change.

Replying to [@bhutz](#comment%3A11):
> As user, if I create a point P in projective space. Then make a copy Q=copy(P). Then scale the coordinates of P by some value P.scale_by(2) or P.normalize_coordinates(). I do not expect the coordinates of Q to also change.

As a user I would not even expect the coordinates of P to change, since P advertises having a well-defined hash.

However, I see that `scale_by` and `normalize_coordinates` do not change the equality or hash of the point. So those are sort-of OK.

If you just change `Q._coords` to a tuple, you'd be done (after fixing the resulting failures). A tuple should be more efficient here anyway.

Well, here is what it would look like changing the ._coords for points to a tuple and ._polys for maps to a tuple.

This works for everything in /schemes/. I'm currently running the tests on all of sage to see if there are any other places that need updated with this change.
