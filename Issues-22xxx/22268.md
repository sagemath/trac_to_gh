The copy function for scheme points does not actually produce a copy of the coords. So if you change a value of the coordinates it changes both the point and the copy.

```
sage: P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(ZZ,1)
sage: Q=P(152,113)
sage: copy(Q) is Q
False
sage: copy(Q)._coords is Q._coords
True
```

The last output should also be false.

What is happening in that example is that the quo_rem fails to return a nonzero reminder, so then maxima is tried. The division in maxima (line 964) is not checked to see if the remainder is zero (which it is not).

As a user I would not even expect the coordinates of P to change, since P advertises having a well-defined hash.

However, I see that `scale_by` and `normalize_coordinates` do not change the equality or hash of the point. So those are sort-of OK.

If you just change `Q._coords` to a tuple, you'd be done (after fixing the resulting failures). A tuple should be more efficient here anyway.

Yes, the hash was made to be independent of the choice of representation. Although I do see that does not quite work correctly as written, if the representation is not in standard form over a field, it isn't normalized first. But that is easily fixed.

changing the ._coords to a tuple does fix the copy 'issue' and scale_by and normalize_coordinates can be made to work with that. I'm fine with making this ticket that take approach instead.

The paradigm shift of having scale_by and normalize_coordinates return a new point instead of changing the coordinates in place is one I do not prefer. If this is in conflict with how most other parts of Sage works, then an argument could be made to make this conform, but it would a major change in how all scheme points/maps work.

Well, here is what it would look like changing the ._coords for points to a tuple and ._polys for maps to a tuple.

This works for everything in /schemes/. I'm currently running the tests on all of sage to see if there are any other places that need updated with this change.
