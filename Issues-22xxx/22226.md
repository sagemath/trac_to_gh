Andrey, the final tarball is only 130KB. I can provide a copy on GitHub if you like, but I assume you'll want to generate it yourself to be sure the `spkg-src` file works as expected.

It took me some time to realize I had to generate the tarball manually. I initially assumed that would happen automatically, so maybe I should add something to the documentation. How does the tarball get to the mirrors after someone generates it?

In `spkg-install` I simply remove any existing target and recreate the directory. I figured this would be safest for future upgrades, but feel free to give feedback on that.

My understanding is that the only file skipped at the moment is the license and it seems small and important enough to include.

Regarding URLs - why use CDN for a one-time download? To me straight pull from github.com seems more suitable.

Also URL1/2/3 kind of ask to be put in some cycle but I am not a fan of shell programming so will not insist on it ;-)

Regarding getting tarballs to mirrors - there should be one attached to the ticket and when it is positively reviewed and merged that file goes to the mirrors, it is a manual process by the release manager.

If you think it is completely useless, I can just as well download it for [SageMathCell](SageMathCell) during build (there are other files pulled directly from github, so another one is not a problem). The plan is to drop current threejs function anyway.
