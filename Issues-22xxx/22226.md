Andrey, the final tarball is only 130KB. I can provide a copy on GitHub if you like, but I assume you'll want to generate it yourself to be sure the `spkg-src` file works as expected.

It took me some time to realize I had to generate the tarball manually. I initially assumed that would happen automatically, so maybe I should add something to the documentation. How does the tarball get to the mirrors after someone generates it?

In `spkg-install` I simply remove any existing target and recreate the directory. I figured this would be safest for future upgrades, but feel free to give feedback on that.

I don't see the point in modifying `spkg-install` to copy only necessary files - there should be no unnecessary files, so copying the whole `src` as before should be fine. My understanding is that the only file skipped at the moment is the license and it seems small and important enough to include.

Regarding URLs - why use CDN for a one-time download? To me straight pull from github.com seems more suitable.

Also URL1/2/3 kind of ask to be put in some cycle but I am not a fan of shell programming so will not insist on it ;-)

Regarding getting tarballs to mirrors - there should be one attached to the ticket and when it is positively reviewed and merged that file goes to the mirrors, it is a manual process by the release manager.

Well, the current implementation of threejs in [SageMathCell](../wiki/SageMathCell) uses it, and while browsers support WebGL there may be hardware (or software environment) that does not support it - my old notebook had to fall back to canvas and I believe Windows in VM had to do it as well when it at all worked.

If you think it is completely useless, I can just as well download it for [SageMathCell](../wiki/SageMathCell) during build (there are other files pulled directly from github, so another one is not a problem). The plan is to drop current threejs function anyway.
