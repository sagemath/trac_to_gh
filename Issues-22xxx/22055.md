it would be nice to have Remez algorithm implemented in Sage.
It provides an optimal approximation of a function by a polynomial of given degree on an interval [a,b]. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm.

Marc, I just did `git pull` from Sage 7.4, then `git branch -r` does not show any branch with sollya in it.

Sorry if I wasn't clear: *PythonSollya* has some support for *Sage*, not conversely.
