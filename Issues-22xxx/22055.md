it would be nice to have Remez algorithm implemented in Sage.
It provides an optimal approximation of a function by a polynomial of given degree on an interval [a,b]. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm.

Hi Paul,

Yes, that would be nice to have. But note that the (experimental) Python-Sollya interface available at https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/anonscm/git/metalibm/pythonsollya.git has (even more experimental) Sage support (on the `cythonsollya-mm` branch) that you can already use to call Sollya's minimax approximation routines on functions implemented using Sage.

Marc, I just did `git pull` from Sage 7.4, then `git branch -r` does not show any branch with sollya in it.

Sorry if I wasn't clear: *PythonSollya* has some support for *Sage*, not conversely.
