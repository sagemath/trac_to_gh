It seems that the current state of this ticket has the following effect:

**Before**, comparison of an element of projective space Pn with "other" tried (by itself) to convert "other" to an element of Pn

**After**, no such conversion is performed. This means that comparison behaves differently, for example P1(0,1) == 0 is not True.

This should rather be fixed by a proper coercion, maybe ?

Since that is a relatively special case, I don't think it will be used that much. If it is desired, then 1-dim projective spaces from their base rings, which would be the simplest way to get the old behavior back. (At least, this is my impression from quickly looking at things.) So I'm setting a positive review and the coercion can be done on a followup ticket.
