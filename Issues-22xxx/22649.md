It seems that the current state of this ticket has the following effect:

**Before**, comparison of an element of projective space Pn with "other" tried (by itself) to convert "other" to an element of Pn

**After**, no such conversion is performed. This means that comparison behaves differently, for example P1(0,1) == 0 is not True.

This should rather be fixed by a proper coercion, maybe ?

I agree that coercion is the right way to go (it's been on the TODO list for awhile now).

As for this change without coercion. I'm not concerned with most of the schemes files as anything being careful about where points live will be fine and those short cuts are much less intuitive when the dimension is >1. I thought the elliptic curve files used the implicit P(0,1)==0 fairly often, but it seems like all tests currently pass. Perhaps John Cremona can comment more on the elliptic curve perspective.

No. I try to avoid looking at this low level stuff so if tests still pass and it is no slower to test equality of points on elliptic curves then go ahead.
