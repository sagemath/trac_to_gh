A "conversion" is a dictionary entry which maps object names in an interface (e.g. Maxima, Mathematica, Giac, ...) to corresponding objects with a different name in Sage.

Some conversions relevant to the Giac interface are missing:

- Derivatives of Dirac delta, as in `Dirac(t, 1)`.
- Special function names at `/functions/orthogonal_polys.py`.

See also: 

- In the file: `local/share/giac/doc/aide_cas`, lines starting by # are keywords followed by synonyms, next lines are for small doc and see also. Full doc can be found in: [Symbolic algebra and Mathematics with Xcas](http://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/doc/en/cascmd_en/cascmd_en.html)

- `sage.libs.pynac.pynac.register_symbol` can be used to register new symbols in the `symbols_table`, as in `register_symbol(heaviside,{'giac':'Heaviside'})`.

- for `BuiltIn` functions which exist in giac with a different name, it is sufficient to update the `conversions` dictionary for the corresponding `__init__` method. 

Depends on #22422

I went through the files in `sage/functions` to add as many conversions for special functions as possible, but could only find ten that were different from Sage.

The Giac exponential integrals `Ei`, `Si` and `Ci` have existing Sage aliases, so there shouldn't be a problem with those.

The orthogonal polynomials `hermite` and `laguerre` have the same names in Giac and Sage. Same for `erf` and a pending `erfc`, as well as `binomial` and `factorial`.

The Giac function `Psi` has is a different name from Sage `psi`, but the order of the arguments is reversed so I didn't add it now.

true and they agree if just 1 argument is passed.

also:

- should Giac's `abs` be mapped so `abs_symbolic`? notice that asking for `abs_symbolic??`, there is already some: 

```
"""GinacFunction.__init__(self, "abs", latex_name=r"\mathrm{abs}",
                               conversions=dict(sympy='Abs'))

```
sage: integrate(dirac_delta(x-2)*sin(x), x, 0, 4)    # unevaluated??

hi,
i've added some simple conversions. 

remaining:

- rootof
- psi function
- derivative of delta function. 

for the last item is not clear to me if it is required to write a `_derivative_` method for `FunctionDiracDelta`, or to write a new a class `FunctionDiracDeltaDerivative`, or if it's about passing a dictionary element with some preprocessing (some arguments) so that say `Dirac(x, 2)` (giac) changes to `diff(dirac_delta(x), x, x)` in sage and conversely.

interesting. it seems that giac's `igamma` corresponds to `gamma_inc_lower` in Sage (lower incomplete Gamma). moreover, giac's `ugamma` corresponds to `gamma_inc` in Sage (upper incomplete Gamma). i'll add these conversions asap.
