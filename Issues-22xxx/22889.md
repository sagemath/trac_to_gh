```
There are many instances in the Sage library of code like

```
if A == True:
...
if B == False:
...
if C == None:
...
```
which (most of the time) should be changed to

```
if A:
...
if not B:
...
if C is None:
...
```
There are some exceptions, for example if `B` can be `True`, `False`, or `None`, then we may want to use `if B is False` to distinguish between `False` and `None`. But most should be changed.

I'm not entirely convinced with the `!=` cases. My gut feeling is that `x != False` should be translated as `x is not False`. If `x` can only be `True` or `False`, why write `x != False` instead of the simpler `x == True`?

What do you think?

As to why write `x != False` instead of `x == True`, sometimes there are several possible values for `x`, for example as in plot/plot.py -- see below. So I can understand it, but in those cases, `if x != False` is equivalent to `if x`.

I tried to make sure that wasn't the situation in any of the changes I made.

- in `ode.pyx`: this file is badly documented, but I think the changes here are okay.

- in linear_code.py, `if ans != False`: as far as I can tell, `ans` can be either `False` or a list of positive length, so `if ans != False:` is the same as `if ans`. (`ans` is set to `B1.is_isomorphic(B2)`, where `is_isomorphic` comes from `sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_binary`. That method is not well documented: what are the possible return values? From the code, it should be either `False` or a list, as I said. Or can the list have length 0 somehow?)

- in hyperplane_arrangement/plot.py, `if hyperplane_legend != False:` `hyperplane_legend` can be a bool or either of the strings "long" or "short", so the change is safe, just as in the previous case.

- `assert self._regular!=False`: I already changed this to `assert self._regular is not False`

- in plot/plot.py: `detect_poles != False`. `detect_poles` can be `True`, `False` or `"show"`. So safe to change.

You don't seem very convinced, so I would prefer to use `is False` here.

I just checked: the `NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct` used in linear_code.py will not produce a length zero list. The length of the list is `self.degree`, and `self.degree` is the number of columns in the matrix used to define `self`. If I plug in a matrix with zero columns, I get this lovely thing:

```
sage: NonlinearBinaryCodeStruct(matrix(GF(2), 2, 0))
python(69054,0x7fff7dcbe000) malloc: *** error for object 0x1afbd0002: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0   signals.so                          0x00000001113747f5 print_backtrace + 37
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
So the list will always have a positive number of entries. I can still make the change to `is False` if you want; I don't care that much.
