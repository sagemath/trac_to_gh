```
If `A` is a ring, then the matrix group `GL(n, A)` does not have a coercion map to the ring `MatrixSpace(A, n)` of which it is the unit group:

```
sage: A = Zmod(4)
sage: R = MatrixSpace(A, 2)
sage: G = GL(2, A)
sage: R.has_coerce_map_from(G)
False
sage: m = R([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
sage: m in G
True
sage: m in list(G)
False
sage: m == G(m)
False
```
All answers should be True.  The fact that `m in G` returns the correct answer despite this bug is the result of a non-standard implementation of `__contains__()`; see #22092 (of which this ticket is a dependency).

There was one doctest failure (in `src/sage/groups/matrix_gps/finitely_generated.py`), which uncovered the following existing bug:

```
A = SR
R = MatrixSpace(A, 2)
m = R([[1,1],[0,1]])
G = MatrixGroup([m])
G.register_embedding(R)  # declare coercion embedding
loads(dumps(G))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'homset_category'
```
The error also arises with `A = RR` or `CC`, but not with `A = ZZ`, `QQ` or `GF(17)`, for example; I guess this is because a different (GAP-based) class is used in the latter cases.

I see your point; I do find the new solution more elegant than the old one, but this might partly be because `MatrixSpace` still uses the old coercion system.

About the possibility for the user to profit from `register_embedding()` being available: users should not count on being able to do this, as the same group may well have been constructed earlier in the same Sage session and have been used in the coercion system.  In this case `register_embedding()` will fail.

Anyway, I only have a slight preference for the new solution.  Vincent, what are your reasons for preferring this solution?

> While I cannot see the only branch because you forced-push, I suspect the previous version was a better approach.

The old version is [commit 231eb32](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=231eb328fe409443347a40c447789d3cdfc689d7).

I don't understand the logic. Travis, you are proposing to declare the coercion in the `MatrixSpace` code?

> About the possibility for the user to profit from `register_embedding()` being available: users should not count on being able to do this, as the same group may well have been constructed earlier in the same Sage session and have been used in the coercion system.  In this case `register_embedding()` will fail.


+1. This has been proved to be confusing and broken (#19016, #15303, #19388).

> Anyway, I only have a slight preference for the new solution.  Vincent, what are your reasons for preferring this solution?


Looks more (mathematically) natural to me. When I define a subset `Y` of `X` I want to set a coerce embedding from `Y` to `X`. I might be wrong.

I also prefer having the embedding declared once for all in init. There could be an option in the constructor to have this embedding. I would follow what is done for number fields: the embedding is part of the input data to construct it.

Travis, you are proposing to declare the coercion in the `MatrixSpace` code?\n\n\nYes, that is where it should go by our long-standing API for the coercion framework. Using `register_embedding()`, you are doing something using a dynamic (and as you mention below, somewhat fragile) method instead of the *standard*,  well-used, and static/method-based handles to doing coercions.\n\n> > About the possibility for the user to profit from `register_embedding()` being available: users should not count on being able to do this, as the same group may well have been constructed earlier in the same Sage session and have been used in the coercion system.

By also defining an embedding during construction, you've created a unique situation in Sage, which will further confuse users, and now likely experts.\n\n> > Anyway, I only have a slight preference for the new solution.

That being said, I disagree with using the (only one) coerce embedding of the matrix group as it takes away that limited resource from the user and we have more general approaches, even with `ParentWithGens`. It also becomes a single point in the code where the coercions are handled, making maintenance and the logic easier (including when switching to `Parent`/new coercion system).

Yes, that is where it should go by our long-standing API for the coercion framework. Using `register_embedding()`, you are doing something using a dynamic (and as you mention below, somewhat fragile) method instead of the *standard*,  well-used, and static/method-based handles to doing coercions.

In this case `register_embedding()` will fail.

Then we should avoid it. By also defining an embedding during construction, you've created a unique situation in Sage, which will further confuse users, and now likely experts.

This is close to a fallacy to me, as you are not construction `Y` as a subset of `X`. Besides, you also want `X` to know that `Y` was constructed as a subset of itself. While both viewpoints are valid, in Sage, we essentially decided on the latter one by how we have defined the coercion system.

IMO, this is even better: it is being hard-coded into the class itself, where you do not even need to define the object. Number fields are a different scenario by their construction, but I would still even argue that we should use the standard approach.
