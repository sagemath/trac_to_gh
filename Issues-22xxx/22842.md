In the process of working on #22832, I found it somewhat difficult to understand the implementation of `DocTestDispatcher.parallel_dispatch` (this is generally true of my for anything with a code block nested more than 2 levels deep and is more than a page long).

So I carefully reworked it as a class responsible for managing the state of the parallel dispatcher, and broke the main loop into a number of subroutines.  Otherwise there is no difference in functionality, and it incorporates the changes from #22832.  I think this code is (arguably) easier to understand.

Depends on #22832
Depends on #22695

What I'm trying to say is: do you think it's possible to refactor it in such a way that you write very general code to manage a bunch of subprocesses and then have the doctester use that?

There are other parts in Sage which would benefit from this code, the parallel docbuilder for example.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A10):
> I'm still not entirely sure what you mean.  Don't get me wrong--I fully believe there are good reasons for this implementation which is why I haven't questioned it before.  I just don't know what issues have arisen in the past that led to multiprocessing.Pool being insufficient.

Crashing not, this just hangs:

```
>>> from os import _exit; from multiprocessing import Pool; Pool(1).map(_exit, [0])
```

And exceptions are passed but then you lose the processes which did not raise an exception. It should be possible to continue even when one process raises an exception.

I see--I would consider that a bug but definitely one that needs a workaround.

Another advantage that I hope to generalize is better handling of standard I/O from worker processes.

This is the Executor interface that Min was talking about--whereas the associated `Future` class is the analogous generalization of the `MapResult` and `AsyncResult` classes of the `multiprocessing` module.

With the work I've already done it should be easy to implement this worker pool implementation on top of that API.
