In the process of working on #22832, I found it somewhat difficult to understand the implementation of `DocTestDispatcher.parallel_dispatch` (this is generally true of my for anything with a code block nested more than 2 levels deep and is more than a page long).

So I carefully reworked it as a class responsible for managing the state of the parallel dispatcher, and broke the main loop into a number of subroutines.  Otherwise there is no difference in functionality, and it incorporates the changes from #22832.  I think this code is (arguably) easier to understand.

I have been considering for a long time to basically separate this as a independent Python project (minus the doctest-specific parts). It's really just a robust reimplementation of `multiprocessing.Pool`.

What I'm trying to say is: do you think it's possible to refactor it in such a way that you write very general code to manage a bunch of subprocesses and then have the doctester use that?

There are other parts in Sage which would benefit from this code, the parallel docbuilder for example.

Crashing not, this just hangs:

```
>>> from os import _exit; from multiprocessing import Pool; Pool(1).map(_exit, [0])
```

And exceptions are passed but then you lose the processes which did not raise an exception. It should be possible to continue even when one process raises an exception.

This is the Executor interface that Min was talking about--whereas the associated `Future` class is the analogous generalization of the `MapResult` and `AsyncResult` classes of the `multiprocessing` module.

With the work I've already done it should be easy to implement this worker pool implementation on top of that API.
