- Extend the method `generating_function_of_integral_points` by an `algorithm` keyword.
- For polytopes implement a naive algorithm that just collects the monomials corresponding to `integral_points`.
- Access the corresponding algorithm of `LattE` like this:

  ```
  sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import count
  sage: P = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
  sage: cddin = P.cdd_Vrepresentation()
  sage: count(cddin, cdd=True, raw_output=True, multivariate_generating_function=True)
```
