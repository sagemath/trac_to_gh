The following does not work:


```
sage: R.<x, y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: a.change_ring(GF(3))
```


However, the following works:


```
sage: R.<x> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: a.change_ring(GF(3))
```
and

```
sage: R.<x, y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: a = x^2 + 3*x^3 + 5*x^-1
sage: R.change_ring(GF(3))(a)
```


   

Keywords: change_ring, Laurent Polynomial ring, multivariate
