`solve` (from `expression.pyx`) passes a relational expression to Maxima's solve, but this doesn't seem to be available in sympy:

```
sage: (x==1)._maxima_()
_SAGE_VAR_x=1
sage: (x==1)._sympy_()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: relation
```

do you have some idea on how to tackle this? otherwise, what about passing `ex.lhs()-ex.rhs()` to sympy's solve.

Is that the expected behaviour ? Or do you plan to enhance the `.sage()` method for various objects ?

Note that SymPy's solve does not respect the global assumptions database:

```
In [12]: global_assumptions
Out[12]: AssumptionsContext([Q.is_true(x > 2), Q.positive(x)])

In [13]: solve(x<3)
Out[13]: -∞ < x ∧ x < 3

In [15]: solve((x>2,x<3))
Out[15]: 2 < x ∧ x < 3
```
So the dependency is irrelevant (at the moment).

So people would need to know that `operands()` gets the solutions. Or we support indexing as alias to `operands()`.

Fly in the ointment : `solve` can solve **systems** of equations, whereas `solveset` (which is, indeed, cleaner on more than one aspect), solves only equations.

In order to solve system, we would have to map `solveset` to all the equations in the system (each for one variable (which one ?)), and return the intersection of the results, which is currently problematic.


> i find that the interface `(equation, variable, domain)` is very clear. isn't it preferable than relying on global assumptions? (or to fallback into the global assumptions if the domain is not provided.)

The domain is only a part of the possible assumptions : e. g., maxima often asks if some expression is positive, if such variable is integer, etc... We need to maintain a "knowledge base" about outr variables as least as rich as our current (= Maxima's) facts base.

A few remarks :

1) I note that Sympy's knowledge base is richer than ours, BTW.

2) We might use profitably something analogous to Mathematica's `Assuming` statement, which does something (roughly )equivalent to :

```
def assuming(condset, statement):
    try:
        OldAssumptions=assumptions()
        Assumptions=OldAssumptions.copy()
        Assumptions.extend(condset)
        forget(assumptions())
        assume(Assumptions)
        result=<do statement, somehow>
    finally:
        forget(assumptions())
        assume(OldAssumptions)
```
The wasp in the ointment is of course that `statement` is evaluated before being passed to Assuming : Python has no macroes...

I *think* that `assuming` could be implemented somehow as a decorator, but I'm still to understand *that*.

I have abandoned the idea of respecting assumptions after I saw that SymPy doesn't either. We don't have to reproduce Maxima results so we're good.

> solve can solve systems of equations, whereas solveset (which is, indeed, cleaner on more than one aspect), solves only equations.

If they replace it will be unified. And I think Sage's `ex.solve()` and `solve(ex)` should be unified too, if for no other reason than for better maintenance. 

> In order to solve system, we would have to map solveset to all the equations in the system (each for one variable (which one ?)), and return the intersection of the results, which is currently problematic.

It's always problematic because you need to decide ordering of expressions without variables, and that can take time because of the possible need to increase precision. The question is, should we support SymPy's solve or immediately use solveset exclusively?

> We might use profitably something analogous to Mathematica's Assuming

Please review #10035.

Isn't that the same as a local context?

That's pushing the can down the road : in order to get the solutions, we're bound to solve a system comprising the solutions obtained without the assumptions and the assumptions themselves, which might be unsolvable (e. g. cubic equation with a solution in *casus irreducibilis* + constraints showing that the roots are real)...

Done (positively). But that is a possible solution only for function calls supporting `hold`. `solve` isn't one of them.

It motivates me to create a context infrastructure where you can say:

```
sage: mycontext = context(x>0, hold)
sage: with mycontext:
sage:     solve(...)
```
or

```
sage: mycontext.start()
sage: ...
sage: solve(...)
sage: mycontext.stop()
```

I gave the first answer in order to give an idea.

I remember reading in devel that previous developers hoped so too, also because at that time development on Pynac stopped and practically no one worked on symbolics in Sage. While that's no longer the case, solvers and integration need much help from SymPy, Fricas, and Giac.

SymPy seems to make a clear distinction between the operators in `x>0` and `Gt(x,0)`. I think it's wrong that `(x>0)._sympy_()` returns `x>0`.

In my (limited) experience, the ability od Sage to call "at will"  SymPy, fricas, giac (and even maple and  mathematica, but shhh...) is *extremely* useful for practical work. Add `Sage\TeX` to the mixture (the notebook is nice for prottyping, but I'm sold on "literate programming" for any serious publication work...), and you get a tool whose usefulness surpasses those of any of its components.

IMHO, Sage needs a lot of development in the "engineering/scientific/undergrad maths" department, which is not, to say the least, the core interest of its core developers. I see the work in this direction as an *investment* : if we make a tool useful to those non-professional-mathematician users,I would be quite surprised that none of them would dive in Sage development in these departments, thus relieving the algebraists, geometers and number theorist who *are* the core  developers of Sage of the infrastructure and maintenance work.

Aha ! I didn't understand that you had merged the necessary tickets.

Anyway : on top of 8.1.beta9 + #23980+2#4026+#24119, passes ptestlong with no errors whatsoever.

It needs doc, however. And some options do not seem to work on multivariate systems :

```
sage: solve(x^3+1==0,x,domain="real") ## domain="real" does not work in Maxima's solver...
