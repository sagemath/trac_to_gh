Move `from sage.arith.misc import factor` below the `self.is_distributive()` check. Actually, I would argue that it should not raise a `ValueError` in this case, but instead simply return `False`. However, I've lost similar arguments before (the `is_similar` of matrices).

True, done that.

> Move `from sage.arith.misc import factor` below the `self.is_distributive()` check.

Well... Done that too. It is of course faster to `import` only when needed, but it should be a special case if the user tries to see if a non-distributive lattice is a Stone lattice. There are also functions having something like

```
import somefunction ...
if self.cardinality() < 5: return True
if somefunction(self.bottom()) ...
```

and I think having `import`s at a start is more readable.

> Actually, I would argue that it should not raise a `ValueError` in this case, but instead simply return `False`. However, I've lost similar arguments before (the `is_similar` of matrices).

Two-sided question. But then at least `skeleton()` should be changed too.

I think there is also some other boolean-valued functions with similar behaviour, so please just set to a positive review.
