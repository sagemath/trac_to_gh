Last two nitpicks.

```diff

and similar. Here it is worthwhile to break the 80 char limit for readability.

Move `from sage.arith.misc import factor` below the `self.is_distributive()` check. Actually, I would argue that it should not raise a `ValueError` in this case, but instead simply return `False`. However, I've lost similar arguments before (the `is_similar` of matrices).

Done that too. It is of course faster to `import` only when needed, but it should be a special case if the user tries to see if a non-distributive lattice is a Stone lattice.

True, done that.

Well... Done that too. It is of course faster to `import` only when needed, but it should be a special case if the user tries to see if a non-distributive lattice is a Stone lattice. There are also functions having something like

```
import somefunction ...
if self.cardinality() < 5: return True
if somefunction(self.bottom()) ...
```

and I think having `import`s at a start is more readable.

Two-sided question. But then at least `skeleton()` should be changed too.

`skeleton()` is a different issue because it is not asking a boolean question, but instead constructing a new object. In that case, the correct thing to do (IMO) is raise a `ValueError`. While I have a strong opinion on this matter, I don't care enough to refight this battle. So if you prefer this method, then I will set it to a positive review.

I think there is also some other boolean-valued functions with similar behaviour, so please just set to a positive review.
