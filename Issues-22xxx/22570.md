1. Factor out some common code for creating GAP and libGAP workspaces.

2. Ensure that workspaces are written without race conditions (possible fix for #22536)

3. Consider a workspace up-to-date if its timestamp equals the minimal timestamp (possible fix for #20421)

By the way, one more reason for this ticket is that (now removed) `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"`
in `spkg-install` of `database_gap` sometimes hanged the installation if kept there, whereas without this call one might have to run `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` separately, as recently witnessed on #22576.
