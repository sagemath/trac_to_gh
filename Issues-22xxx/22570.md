By the way, one more reason for this ticket is that (now removed) `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"`
in `spkg-install` of `database_gap` sometimes hanged the installation if kept there, whereas without this call one might have to run `sage -c "gap_reset_workspace()"` separately, as recently witnessed on #22576.

I see that as an independent issue. Let's deal with that either on #22576 or on a new ticket.
