The animate command allows to animate a list of frames by creating a `sage.plot.animate.Animation` object.

In a Jupyter notebook environment, the code below returns `Animation with 20 frames`, while it should have a similar behaviour as with the sage notebook (displaying a gif).

```
f(x) = 5*x - x^2/8 + x^3/1200
df(x) = diff(f(x),x)
max = 100
p = plot(f(x),x,0,max)
lblp = text("$y = " + latex(f(x)) + "$",[40,100],fontsize=14)
lbldp = text("$y' = " + latex(df(x)) + "$",[40,80],fontsize=14,rgbcolor='#006000')
ga = []
for argx in srange(0,max,5):
    dp = plot(f(argx) + (df(argx)*(x-argx)),x,0,max,color="#006000")
    xp = point((argx,f(argx)),rgbcolor='#800000')    
    ga.append(p+lblp+lbldp+dp+xp)
animate(ga,ymin=0,ymax=max,axes_labels=['x','y'],fontsize=12,figsize=(4,3)).show(delay=1)
```

Probably intersecting #16573, #16650 and #17783.

<a id='comment:8'></a>The patch adds GIF support to the jupyter notebook.

Actual html5 video would be better, but also requires some encoder like ffmpeg. Whereas I think we can generate animated gif without external dependencies.

Of course you don't have to call `animate(...).show()`, the displayhook already renders the animation if it can. Really its our fault for having that confusingly-named `show()` method.
