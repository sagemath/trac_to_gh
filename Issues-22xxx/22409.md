This ticket lists some Debian patches that we're applying to Sage. They should be fairly non-controversial.

(We have other patches which need some more work and discussion; I'll be submitting those later as well.)

These were taken from our 7.5.1 branch, which is a WIP. They applied cleanly to 7.6, apart from a trivial merge conflict fix in the case of "Don't fail plot.py". However I haven't tested it on a non-Debian install yet (I don't have the build resources for that right this minute).
