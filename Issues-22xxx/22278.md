This is bad:

```
sage: Q = DiGraph({1:{2:['a']}, 2:{1:['b']}})
sage: Q.path_semigroup().inject_variables()
Defining e_1, e_2, a, b
sage: (b*a)[-1:]
a
sage: (b*a)[-1:] == a
False
```

I have problems to find a good "component" for this ticket. "graph theory" is not totally absurd, so, I chose this.

I found the problem: When creating the sub-path, a wrong start- resp. endpoint is read off. Since start and endpoint are taken into account when comparing paths, the problem from the ticket description arises.

While I was at it, I also fixed some corner cases of slicing, and exposed it in the tests. Needs review!
