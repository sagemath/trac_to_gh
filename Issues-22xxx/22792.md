Adds the [`lazy_object_proxy`](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy) package for Python as a dependency of sage.

This could be used to replace code in `sage.misc.lazy_import`.  It's also a slightly more generic implementation of a lazy proxy (granted, the existing one in Sage could also be made more generic with only slight modifications).

More details about how I intend to use are in #22793.

What's up with this, does it really require `clang`?

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ] && [ $MACOSX_VERSION -ge 16 ]; then
    echo "OS X 10.$[$MACOSX_VERSION-4] Building with clang."
    CC=clang
fi
```

Oops, no, I obviously just copied the package from psutil and didn't check closely enough. Very tired.
