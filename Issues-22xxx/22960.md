`RealLazyField()` and `ComplexLazyField()` claim to be exact, but they are not:

```
sage: RLF.is_exact()
True
sage: a = RLF(0.1) ; a
0.10000000000000001?
sage: a._value
0.100000000000000
sage: a._value.parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

Note that the doc of `RLF` itself claims to be exact.

```
    This class represents the set of real numbers to unspecified precision.
    For the most part it simply wraps exact elements and defers evaluation
    until a specified precision is requested.
