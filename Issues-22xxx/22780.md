The following bug was reported to me by Sander Dahmen and Joey van Langen:

```
sage: M = ModularForms(SL2Z, 12)
sage: Delta = M.basis()[0]; Delta
q - 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4 + 4830*q^5 + O(q^6)
sage: T2 = M.hecke_operator(2)
sage: T2(Delta) == -24*Delta
False
```
This happens because (apparently since #9749) the Hecke matrix is computed with respect to a different basis than `M.q_expansion_basis()`:

```
sage: M._compute_hecke_matrix(2)
[  2049 196560]
[     0    -24]
```
The correct answer is

```
[ -24    0]
[   0 2049]
```
Compare the following:

```
sage: M.q_expansion_basis()
[
q - 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4 + 4830*q^5 + O(q^6),
1 + 65520/691*q + 134250480/691*q^2 + 11606736960/691*q^3 + 274945048560/691*q^4 + 3199218815520/691*q^5 + O(q^6)
]
sage: hecke_operator_on_basis(M.q_expansion_basis(), 2, 12)
[ -24    0]
[   0 2049]
```
vs.

```
sage: victor_miller_basis(12)
[
1 + 196560*q^2 + 16773120*q^3 + 398034000*q^4 + 4629381120*q^5 + 34417656000*q^6 + 187489935360*q^7 + 814879774800*q^8 + 2975551488000*q^9 + O(q^10),
q - 24*q^2 + 252*q^3 - 1472*q^4 + 4830*q^5 - 6048*q^6 - 16744*q^7 + 84480*q^8 - 113643*q^9 + O(q^10)
]
sage: hecke_operator_on_basis(victor_miller_basis(12), 2, 12)
[  2049 196560]
[     0    -24]
```
