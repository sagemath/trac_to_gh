```
Some deprecation in sandpile are in fact already removed, but still present in lazy imports. This breaks ups `vars()` and `locals()`.

Namely, these are `grid_sandpile` and `complete_sandpile`.

In fact, we should clean up everything that was deprecated in #18618.

However, we leave `sandlib` in the code, only remove it from the global namespace, as e.g. `sandlib('gor')` does not have an equivalent.

Also, it turns out that while calling `vars()` directly still fails, one now can at least do

```
v=vars()
for k in v.keys(): print v[k]
```




Depends on #22582
