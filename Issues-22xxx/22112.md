Hum... Curious, I have re-tested on my macbook running the latest sierra and xcode (8.2.1 here too) and I don't have that problem. The only real obvious difference is sandybridge for you and halswell for me. 
Was it a build from scratch or an incremental upgrade from an older sage? From the fact you are downloading openblas I would say the later.
Could you find the file `osx.def` in the build folder and post it please.

It was build from scratch in a brand new clone of the development branch from the git repo. I have uploaded the file you requested, as well as the global `config.log` in case that is helpful.  The CPU on this machine is a Xeon E5-1680 v2.

So I removed brew's copy of gfortran (in fact, it's entire copy of gcc) and now openblas builds!  I'm not sure why openblas was finding the wrong gfortran since even during the initial build I had:

```
% ./sage -sh
Note: SAGE_ROOT=/pkgs/sage-git
> which gfortran
/pkgs/sage-git/local/bin/gfortran
```

Regardless, many thanks.  What's the right was of closing this ticket in this situation?
