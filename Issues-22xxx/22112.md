Could you find the file `osx.def` in the build folder and post it please.

It was build from scratch in a brand new clone of the development branch from the git repo. I have uploaded the file you requested, as well as the global `config.log` in case that is helpful.  The CPU on this machine is a Xeon E5-1680 v2.

Ouch, you have brew on your system. It seems that you have things set up to use clang from the system and gfortran from brew, but usually the presence of brew in its default location brings trouble.

So I removed brew's copy of gfortran (in fact, it's entire copy of gcc) and now openblas builds!  I'm not sure why openblas was finding the wrong gfortran since even during the initial build I had:

```
% ./sage -sh
Note: SAGE_ROOT=/pkgs/sage-git
> which gfortran
/pkgs/sage-git/local/bin/gfortran
```

Regardless, many thanks.  What's the right was of closing this ticket in this situation?
