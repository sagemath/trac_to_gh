Yes, both clang and gcc. If I start with a Sage tarball and I set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `SAGE_INSTALL_CCACHE=yes`, then I get this failure with `gcc`. If I use #12426, I get this failure with `clang`.

On the other hand, if I build Sage first and then do `./sage -f -c ccache`, I get this failure with `gcc`, but with `#12426`, it skips the tests:

```
test/main

WARNING: Compiler gcc not supported (version: Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1) -- not running tests

This branch upgrade to `ccache-3.3.4` which should pass the test. It also probably fixes #24360. I added a patch to support proper detection of `/usr/bin/gcc` as `clang` on OS X. That part should be reviewed in combination with #12426.

That's new, I hadn't tested sage's gcc on OS X, only a pre-built binary of gcc-7.1.0. I am not submitting my laptop to build gcc again. I'll see if I can reproduce it with a pre made binary of 7.2.0.

When you say it pass with `clang`, did you set `CC=clang` or did you let `CC` default to `/usr/bin/gcc`? The first case is no problem, the other is why I added a patch.
