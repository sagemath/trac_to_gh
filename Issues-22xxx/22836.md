<a id='comment:2'></a>Yes, both clang and gcc. If I start with a Sage tarball and I set `SAGE_CHECK=yes` and `SAGE_INSTALL_CCACHE=yes`, then I get this failure with `gcc`. If I use #12426, I get this failure with `clang`.

On the other hand, if I build Sage first and then do `./sage -f -c ccache`, I get this failure with `gcc`, but with `#12426`, it skips the tests:

```

the test is written with the results of a linux install in mind. It would fare better if things were identified from configure using ax_compiler_vendor.m4. It is really curious it fails the way it does if you build it as part of the toolchain.

I think we may have a case where testing on OS X is just not currently supported.

When you say it pass with `clang`, did you set `CC=clang` or did you let `CC` default to `/usr/bin/gcc`? The first case is no problem, the other is why I added a patch.

I just built with this plus #12426, so I let `CC` default to `/usr/bin/gcc`.

All right passes its tests here with sage's own gcc on Gentoo linux. So it is a OS X only issue.

I note that it looks like the original report. I haven't tested sage's own gcc during this ticket because I don't like building it on my laptop. But pre-built gcc binaries have been fine. So I am starting to think that the root cause of this particular report is the way sage builds gcc on OS X.
