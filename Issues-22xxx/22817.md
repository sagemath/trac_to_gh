Our cryptominisat is currently locked at version 2.9.6, which does not build on 32bit architecture, while the current version of cryptominisat is 5.0.1. This ticket aims at updating the package.

Note that our current cython interface does not work with cryptominisat 5. However, cryptominisat now offers it own python bindings, so we have to rewrite the interface to use that instead.

Note that cryptominisat 5 relies on cmake, which needs to be updated to compile on 32bit architecture as well, see #22814.

Tarball available at : https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/archive/5.0.1.tar.gz to be renamed cryptominisat-5.0.1.tar.gz

**WARNING** Do not merge this ticket until the Sage interface has been updated, see #22818.

OK as mentioned on #22818 the package needs some love on OS X. I did a few QA on `CMakeList.txt` and tried not to get too carried away. As a bonus I changed `spkg-install` to find sage's zlib rather than the system one.

People should check for adverse effects on linux. But on OS X things should now work better.

On *Ubuntu 16.04*, on top of 8.0.beta7, I get

```
$ make cryptominisat
...
[cmake-3.8.0] Successfully installed cmake-3.8.0
...
[cryptominisat-5.0.1] Successfully installed cryptominisat-5.0.1
```

Then,

```python
sage: from pycryptosat import Solver
sage: s = Solver()
sage: s.add_clause((1r,1r,1r,1r,-1r))
sage: s.solve()
(True, (None, False))
```

I will check whether it works on my OSX later (my osx being at home).
