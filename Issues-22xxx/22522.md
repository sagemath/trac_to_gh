Looks good to me.

Now follow-up tickets with corresponding methods of `Polyhedron` would be good.

It's me struggling to get tests work in the particular case where a string is passed as argument  :( 

Probably some issue with string conversion. See this:

In the Sage REPL, the usual single quotes work, as in:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: P.integrate('[[3,[2,4,6]],[7,[0, 3, 5]]]')   
629/47775
```

(ok I'm already using #20887 for P.integrate(..) but you get the point).

However the doctests didn't pass if I used that, but they pass with the double quote in one test. In Python it seems to have a meaning:

```
sage: type(``x``)
<type 'str'>
```

But I'd like to understand what went wrong with just single quotes, of course.

There are also a number of doc issues with `integrate` in `base.py`. The doc should start with

```
    def integrate(self, polynomial, **kwds):
        r"""
        Return the integral of a polynomial over a polytope.

        INPUT:

        - ``polynomial`` -- a multivariate polynomial or a valid LattE description string
          for a polynomial

        - ``**kwds`` -- additional keyword arguments that are passed to the engine

        OUTPUT:

        The integral of the polynomial over the polytope.

        .. NOTE::

            The polytope triangulation algorithm is used. This function depends on
            LattE (i.e., the ``latte_int`` optional package).
```
The code in the `EXAMPLES::` block also needs to be indented (as per [comment:16](#comment%3A16)).

It does not make any sense. If I have a Polyhedron defined over RDF (= non exact field) its volume can not defined as an element of QQ (= exact field).

Hmm.. Matrices have a change_ring feature that comes very handy for conversion. Shall we add a similar one for Polyhedron? 

And following your recommendation, make integrate and volume via `latte` raise a value error when instantiated with, say, `P = 1.4142*polytopes.cube()`. 

With the change ring, we could still integrate integrate a polynomial over P with the slightly more complicated `P.change_ring().integrate(x<sup>2*y</sup>2*z^2)`, instead of the ugly

```
sage: P_QQ = Polyhedron(vertices = [[QQ(vi) for vi in v] for v in P.vertices_generator()])
sage: P_QQ.integrate(x^2*y^2*z^2)
```

If there are alternative recommended options, I'd really like to learn; but I can post it as a ask.sagemath one if i'm off-topic :)

Integration over an RDF polyhedron via QQ polyhedron (latte) could make sense *as long as the method converts the answer back to RDF* to indicate that the answer is inexact.

As to `change_ring`, this could be useful. I had related discussions with JP.
