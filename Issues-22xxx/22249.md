It is perhaps surprising that `graphs.CycleGraph(n).is_cycle()` will be false for n < 3, but unless that construction would allow loops or multiedges that is just how it is, and `n=0` will definitely not be a cycle.

Thank you for your comments. I knew that the definition was not so "clear".

I checked on the french translation of the book of Bondy and Murty "Graph theory" (http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Frederic.Havet/Traduction-Bondy-Murty.pdf), Section 1.1 pages 4-5. It says that `a cycle on three or more vertices is a simple graph whose vertices can be arranged in a cyclic order so that two vertices are adjacent if they are consecutive in the order, and not adjacent otherwise. A cycle on a vertex consists of a single vertex provided with a loop and a cycle with two vertices consists of two vertices connected by a pair of parallel edges.` 
So this is what you propose.

So I can add the 1 vertex with a unique loop case and the 2 vertices with exactly 2 parallel edges one. And of course add a reference to `Bondy, John Adrian; Murty, U.S.R. (2008), Graph Theory, Springer.`

You agree?

That sounds good.  Do Bondy and Murty talk about digraphs too?

For the case of a digraph, I'm not sure it is correct to use "to_simple" as that just discards loops and multiple edges.  This looks wrong:

```
sage: d = DiGraph([(0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)], loops=True)
sage: d.is_cycle()
True
```
However, this is clearly documented in the code so should not be too surprising to the user.

In the documentation it might be clearer to write "A cycle graph consists of a single cycle **connecting** all its vertices ..." rather than "A cycle graph consists of a single cycle connected all its vertices ...".
