<a id='comment:13'></a>Hello,

This would be really useful.

1) The name is too generic: `generating_function` could be anything (e.g. the number of lattice points in dilates). It should be something like `non_negative_lattice_points_generating_function`.

2) What do you mean by "generating function"? Is it weighted by the sum of the vector?

3) You should at least check that the number of integer partitions is correctly computed by your function with the polyhedron

```
x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 1
```
versus

```
sage: [Partitions(k, length=5).cardinality() for k in range(5,20)]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 18, 23, 30, 37, 47, 57, 70]
```

Good :)

Thank you for your comments. Code updated.

> 1) The name is too generic: `generating_function` could be anything (e.g. the number of lattice points in dilates). It should be something like `non_negative_lattice_points_generating_function`.


It seems that "integral points" is used in sage.geometry.polyhedron` a couple of times, thus,
changed to `generating_function_of_integral_points`.

> 2) What do you mean by "generating function"? Is it weighted by the sum of the vector?


Inserted a formula to make this precise.

> 3) You should at least check that the number of integer partitions is correctly computed by your function with the polyhedron

It makes of course no practical difference in this example. 
But it is the syntactic presence of `yield` in the body of a function that changes a function to a generator. Consider:

```
sage: def test():
....:     if False: yield 1
....: 
sage: test()
<generator object test at 0x105434970>
```
So it is good practice to use `yield from` to pass on another generator, instead of just returning the generator object.

Thanks for the changes you made. I agree, this part is sufficiently clear now

Thanks, this is an improvement. Now I understand that the strings that are assembled in this part of the code are just used for logging. 

I think both the description of the "splitting" in the documentation and the implementation can be made more transparent.

Perhaps it should at least be said that if `split=True`, it uses the complement of the `hyperplane_arrangements.braid`.

Following up on `name`/`names`:

```
+        sage: generating_function_of_integral_points(P2[0],
+        ....:     sort_factors=True, names=('a', 'b'))
+        Traceback (most recent call last):
+        ...
+        ValueError: exactly one variable name has to be provided
```
I don't understand this restriction. Why would the user not be allowed to provide all the names for the variables?
