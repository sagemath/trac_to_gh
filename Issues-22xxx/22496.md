The reference manual for the currently called *combinatorial geometry* needs some logical reorganization.

[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html)

This ticket fixes the following:

- add the normaliz backend to the references and add a note on how to install it.
- fixes an indentation that caused the documentation not to build in the normaliz backend
- the section on combinatorial geometry is renamed by adding also *Discrete*
- the section on hyperbolic geometry gets moved in the table of content to *Geometry and Topology* and not inside Combinatorial and Discrete Geometry (which made no sense).
- the combinatorial and discrete geometry table of content is restructured logically.
- fixes a small bug in the documentation of the base class of polyhedron (missing backtick)
- added some links to other modules in the constructor of polyhedra to different classes and backends.

I agree. I was sorting through the files and for the first version I put the 7 files whose documentation started with 

  This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties

together in a section called //Toric Varieties//.

Perhaps naming the section. //Lattices, Cones, Fans, and related objects// ? What do you think? Do you have any suggestions?

> Also `lattice_polytope` logically fits with them better.


Okay. Are there other modules that would logically go with them as well?

"Toric Geometry" may be appropriate, just no "varieties" themselves, I think.

Everything under "Lattice polyhedra" may be clamped with it - while there are presumably other reasons to consider them, almost everything here was done with toric geometry and mirror symmetry applications in mind.

Sounds good.

> Everything under "Lattice polyhedra" may be clamped with it - while there are presumably other reasons to consider them, almost everything here was done with toric geometry and mirror symmetry applications in mind.


I could put it in the polyhedral computations section after the lattice polytopes, that would be good? One argument to keep "Toric geometry" in its own section is somehow to reflect a little bit the structure in the geometry component (although I admit it does not necessarily have to follow it...) since polyhedron is a module on its own and the toric geometry framework is located directly in geometry and not in polyhedron...

I'm fine with both.

A very related question (for another ticket, but it is good to have your opinion while you are at it) would be to move the isolated python files within `src/sage/geometry/` into some appropriate directory, like `riemannian_manifolds` for riemannian manifolds, `polyhedron` for polyhedra, etc.

The files to classify are:

* cone.py
* fan_isomorphism.py
* fan_morphism.py
* fan.py
* hasse_diagram.py
* integral_points.pyx
* lattice_polytope.py
* linear_expression.py
* newton_polygon.py
* point_collection.pyx
* pseudolines.py
* ribbon_graph.py
