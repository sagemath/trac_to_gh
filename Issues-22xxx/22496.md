The reference manual for the currently called *combinatorial geometry* needs some logical reorganization.

[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html)

This ticket fixes the following:

- add the normaliz backend to the references and add a note on how to install it.
- fixes an indentation that caused the documentation not to build in the normaliz backend
- the section on combinatorial geometry is renamed by adding also *Discrete*
- the section on hyperbolic geometry gets moved in the table of content to *Geometry and Topology* and not inside Combinatorial and Discrete Geometry (which made no sense).
- the combinatorial and discrete geometry table of content is restructured logically.
- fixes a small bug in the documentation of the base class of polyhedron (missing backtick)
- added some links to other modules in the constructor of polyhedra to different classes and backends.

  This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties

together in a section called *Toric Varieties*.

Perhaps naming the section. *Lattices, Cones, Fans, and related objects* ? What do you think? Do you have any suggestions?

Okay. Are there other modules that would logically go with them as well?

"Toric Geometry" may be appropriate, just no "varieties" themselves, I think.

Everything under "Lattice polyhedra" may be clamped with it - while there are presumably other reasons to consider them, almost everything here was done with toric geometry and mirror symmetry applications in mind.

Sounds good.

I'm fine with both.

A very related question (for another ticket, but it is good to have your opinion while you are at it) would be to move the isolated python files within `src/sage/geometry/` into some appropriate directory, like `riemannian_manifolds` for riemannian manifolds, `polyhedron` for polyhedra, etc.

The files to classify are:

* cone.py
* fan_isomorphism.py
* fan_morphism.py
* fan.py
* hasse_diagram.py
* integral_points.pyx
* lattice_polytope.py
* linear_expression.py
* newton_polygon.py
* point_collection.pyx
* pseudolines.py
* ribbon_graph.py
* toric_lattice_element.pyx
* toric_lattice.py
* toric_plotter.py
