The reference manual for the currently called *combinatorial geometry* needs some logical reorganization.

[http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/index.html)

This ticket fixes the following:

- add the normaliz backend to the references and add a note on how to install it.
- fixes an indentation that caused the documentation not to build in the normaliz backend
- the section on combinatorial geometry is renamed by adding also *Discrete*
- the section on hyperbolic geometry gets moved in the table of content to *Geometry and Topology* and not inside Combinatorial and Discrete Geometry (which made no sense).
- the combinatorial and discrete geometry table of content is restructured logically.
- fixes a small bug in the documentation of the base class of polyhedron (missing backtick)
- added some links to other modules in the constructor of polyhedra to different classes and backends.

I agree. I was sorting through the files and for the first version I put the 7 files whose documentation started with 

  This module was designed as a part of framework for toric varieties

together in a section called //Toric Varieties//.

Perhaps naming the section. //Lattices, Cones, Fans, and related objects// ? What do you think? Do you have any suggestions?

> Also `lattice_polytope` logically fits with them better.


Okay. Are there other modules that would logically go with them as well?

Sounds good.

I could put it in the polyhedral computations section after the lattice polytopes, that would be good?

I'm fine with both.
