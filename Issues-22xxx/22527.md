It would conflict with your current branch at #22582, but there is another option: making a reliable symlink `python -> python3` when `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`. As I said at #22582, I would like to hear some other opinions about those two options.

Another way of looking at this: if we're not really thinking about how to run Sage using python3, that it's premature to do so, then: if you build with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, the build will not complete because Sage isn't ready for Python 3 yet, so no matter what the symlink points to, you will get this message. If you build without `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, then the symlink should point to `python2` and this check will behave as it always has.

If we just check whether `local/bin/sage` exists, then you will get a less clear error message if Sage hasn't finished building yet, for whatever reason.

Once we figure out whether `SAGE_PYTHON3` has run-time effects or not, we can modify this check.

Should we bump the version numbers for python2 and python3, to make sure their spkg-install files get run, so the link actually gets removed when people upgrade?

The link can break the python3 build on OS X, but #22756 bumps the version number on python3 to try to address this. It still may break the first time, but in such a way that the build will get far enough to delete the link. After that it should work the next time.
