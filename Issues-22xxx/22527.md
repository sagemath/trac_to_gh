Unlike `load()`, the command `attach()` does not give access to globals. Create a file called `test.sage` containing

```
a = 1
```
and attach it in a **non-IPython** session:

```
$ ./sage --python
Python 2.7.13 (default, Mar  2 2017, 10:40:24) 
[GCC 4.9.4] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from sage.all import *
>>> attach("/tmp/test.sage")
