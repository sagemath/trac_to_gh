Implement lazy imports by overriding [__import__](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__).

To be used as

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import _lazyimport_

with _lazyimport_:
    from sage.all import ZZ
```

Unlike the existing lazy import implementation, this supports both Python and Cython.

Depends on #22755

I haven't looked into this in detail, but python does have an impressive hooks etc. in the import system (hooks that have changed quite a bit in later versions of 3.* as well ...). If we want to co-opt the `import` statement syntax, perhaps we can do something using

Different note on lazy imports: Currently we have hundreds of "lazy-import" objects hanging around coming from
in module `A`:

```
lazy_import('C',XXX}
```
and then in module `B`:

```
from A import XXX
```
The problem is that the lazy import object that gets bound to B.XXX still has a pointer to the namespace of A, so every time B.XXX gets called, it will looking at A.XXX. See #16522. 

If we're going to put hooks into the import system, perhaps we can filter out these issues as well.

Like if the first argument starts with a string, then roll back to the old function...

Hm. Replacing `__import__` within a context manager isn't thread safe. But we COULD replace `__import__` wholesale to do what it normally does, and in extended form allow things like

```
import lazy.sage.calculus.calculus
from lazy.sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import maxima
```
what's more, we could also wrap

```
from A import XXX
```
to check if XXX is a `LazyImport` object and if so, rewrap it referencing the appropriate namespace.

The only offence is that we'd be incompatible with a top-level module "lazy" existing.

The purpose is to use the better name `lazy_import` for your new "lazy import". I guess that you expect the old "lazy import" will gradually be replaced with yours. By that time we would have lost the name `lazy_import` for nothing and be stuck with the not-so-satisfying name `lazyimport`.

Of course, this is a minor issue now...

My impression with PEP 302 is that it is really meant if you actually want to import something in the end and add it to `sys.modules`. This is *not* the case here.

I tried to implement this with PEP 302 at first and it didn't work. Maybe there is some possibility to get it to work somehow, but I'm convinced that replacing `__import__` is the simplest solution.

"the stuff with threads" is needed to support the context manager because it changes a global variable `__builtin__.__import__`. PEP 302 wouldn't make a difference for this because it also uses global variables like `sys.meta_path`.

As usual, lack of thread-safety is a canary for general unintended side-effects that in a highly dynamic environment such as python can also screw things up in the same thread:

Whatever code is wrapped inside the "with lazyimport" now needs to ensure it doesn't trigger other code to execute that happens to rely on "import" meaning what it usually means in python. That's a very hard, non-local restriction to enforce. So I think changing a global binding in this way (which is non-transparent wrt the normal usage) is a no-go. You basically end up with a context in which the only legal command is `import` or `from .. import` (and even there, with the hooks available in the python import system, do you have full control over what code gets executed?

Indeed. A lazy "import module" can  be done through loader hooks, and python3 even has an example class for doing that.

It's the lazy "from module import object" that is tricky to do, and for which it seems `__import__` is the right hook (there is a "from" list there. The other import hooks don't seem to have that info).
Incidentally, that is also the more problematic thing to do and should probably be generally avoided. It leads to proxy objects that easily end up in places where they cannot remove themselves.

If that code just executes an `import` statement and nothing else (which is how this is intented), there should be no problem. I intent this to be used as

```
...some code...
with _lazyimport_:
    from sage.rings.integer import ZZ

not

```

Yes because those other hooks won't be called.

<div id="comment:44" align="right">comment:44</div>

Just to know where we stand, let me try to summarize the pros and cons of my approach. I'll try to do this objectively. It will at least allow to compare different approaches.

New features compared to the old `lazy_import`:

1. Support Python and Cython (imports in Cython work the same way as plain Python, so this is true for anything which hooks the import system).

2. Simple syntax: an ordinary `import` statement inside a `with _lazyimport_` block.

3. Relative and absolute imports are supported.


Existing features from `lazy_import` which are kept:

4. Support for PEP 302 (a module which needs a PEP 302 loader can be lazy imported).

5. Support for optional arguments like `deprecation`.

6. Support for `from ... import *`.

7. Automatic replacement of `LazyImport` in a global namespace by the actual imported object.

8. Existing `lazy_import`s can be easily converted to the new `with _lazyimport_`, preserving all features.


Cons:

9. Only `from ... import ...` is supported, not `import ...`

10. One should be careful not to run arbitrary code inside a `with _lazyimport_` block.

21. It's not implemented using PEP 302 (personally, I don't think that's an issue, but you guys seem to think so).

Finally, let me mention that #21636 is the main reason to work on this, for which in particular proper Cython support for lazy imports is needed.

On a slightly different topic, I don't quite understand why the "deprecation" feature of the existing `lazy_import` needs to be implemented directly through the import syntax or via a wrapper around it.  Similarly for the "startup guard" functionality.  Instead, these features could be implemented if *all* modules in *sage* were wrapped in a custom `Module` subclass/wrapper.  Although I haven't tested as such, I think there'd be little noticeable overhead to doing so.  Then we can add simple syntax at the module level for specifying this behavior.  For example, `sage.combinat.crystals.all` contains a fair number of deprecations.  Instead of:

```
lazy_import('sage.combinat.crystals.letters',
            'CrystalOfLetters',
            deprecation=(15882, "this is being removed from the global namespace. Use crystals.Letters instead"))

lazy_import('sage.combinat.crystals.fast_crystals',
            'FastCrystal',
            deprecation=(15882, "this is being removed from the global namespace. Use crystals.FastRankTwo instead"))

lazy_import('sage.combinat.crystals.highest_weight_crystals',
            'HighestWeightCrystal',
            deprecation=(15882, "this is being removed from the global namespace. Use crystals.HighestWeight instead"))
```

this could look something like:

```
__sage_deprecations__ = [
    ('sage.combinat.crystals.' + mod_name, cls_name, 15822, "this is being removed from the global namespace. Use crystals. %s instead" % cls_name) for mod_name, cls_name in [
        ('letters', 'CrystalOfLetters'),
        ('fast_crystals', 'FastCrystal'),
        ('highest_weight_crystals', 'HeighestWeightCrystals'),
        ...
    ]
]
```

A custom module wrapper would be able handle imports of objects listed in `__sage_deprecations__` (as I'm calling it) through `__getattribute__` and return proxies for those objects, whereas the `sage.combinat.crystals.catalog` module would not have `__sage_deprecations__` and thus would supply the normal, non-proxied objects.

I feel like this is a clearer and more explicit declarative approach to how some attributes of some modules should be handled, rather than mucking with the import system every single time this feature is needed.

> I think I understand better now how this is really *only* trying to override the `from a import b` syntax, which is why you are targeting `__import__` itself.  Though really, the problem with circular imports is the same whether one is using the `import foo` syntax or the `from foo import ...` syntax.  

No, it's not. Python is completely fine with circular imports. The problem arises when there is a circular access of module attributes *during load time*. The problem with "from foo import ..." is that it automatically leads to a module attribute access during load time.

Without "from foo import ..." you'd have to write something like

```
import A

c=A.b+1
```
which is very unlikely to happen, since usually at load time only declarations are executed.

For that kind of symbols we would basically just need

```
#instead of from A import b
import A
forward_binding(target="b",namespace=globals(),from=A,from_name="b")
```
where forward_binding could be resolved as soon as A is initialized. The proxy doesn't have to hang around until first used, as with lazy-import. I'm not sure we have the right hooks to do this, but if there are I think we could change `__import__` to allow one more level of circularity (namely, circularity for "from A import b" provided that A.b doesn't get accessed during load time).

I think there might be a more reliable way: When `__import__` gets called, it does get a "globals" parameter with it as the scope on which to work. We can park our state whether inputs are to be lazy there:

```
builtin.__import__=new_import
lazy_import=True
from A import a
lazy_import=False
import B
```
i.e., the new import uses a binding in the relevant scope to see if it needs to intercept imports and make them lazy or whether they should be processed as normal.

That way, the new import routine would be transparent for scopes where lazy_import isn't being used.

Based on that infrastructure, a context would be just fine. It would be about toggling a flag in the relevant scope rather than changing a global variable.

It does mean we'd need to have our "__import__" wrapper in place all the time, because swapping it *out* would still be sensitive to scoping and threading issues.

I still think that messing so much with imports for what you want to accomplish is overkill.  My point in my last comment was that whether you use the `import foo` or `from import foo ...` syntax the first thing that happens is `foo` is imported, possibly through import hooks, and those hooks can always wrap the `Module` object for `foo` in a proxy that can handle lazy imports.

You could even make the module wrapper itself a context manager for handling lazy imports.  I don't know that this is the clearest syntax but it's an idea:

```
import foo
with foo.__lazy_import__:
    from foo import a
    from foo import b
```

In this case `a` and `b` are `LazyImport` proxies.

I think the 'deprecation warning' aspect of `lazy_import` can be handled through a separate mechanism as explained above.

My experiment in rewriting `LazyImport` worked too--there's just one minor detail with regard to how `__class__` is handled that I need to fix but it's 11:00 p.m. on Friday night here so I'm gonna call it quits until Monday :)

Can we maybe discuss exactly what the use cases are for lazy-import?

To me the *primary* use case--the one that really matters--is just breaking circular imports at startup time.  I've never needed something like lazy imports to get around that before, but I admit some of the circular definitions in Sage are vexing and hard to avoid, especially in Cygwin modules where we have less control over the order in which module-level statements are executed with respect to each other.  So that's one case.

The other two, as far as I can tell, are:

1) Issuing deprecation warnings for imports of some names from modules they shouldn't be directly imported from.

2) Issuing a warning (or error as in #22755) if some proxied lazy import gets resolved during initial startup.

I don't really much see the case for the latter of the two.  If the main use case for lazy imports (and note: I'm not necessarily claiming that's the case, that's just my understanding) then who cares if gets resolved at startup time?  If it does, any nothing breaks, then it doesn't need to be a lazy import in the first place (having this feature optionally for debugging purposes is nice though).
