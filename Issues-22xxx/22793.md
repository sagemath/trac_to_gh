This adds [`lazy_object_proxy`](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy) as a dependency (see #22792), and rewrites the `sage.misc.lazy_import.LazyImport` class on top of it.  This doesn't change anything else about how the `lazy_import` mechanism is implemented and is mostly independent of any such changes (e.g. #22752).

### Pros
* In the spirit of tickets like #21805, removes more code than it adds, replacing Sage-specific code with robust solutions from the Python community...

* ...meaning less code for us to maintain and keep forward-compatible with future Python versions (in principle, but see also the first "con").

* This solution is *probably* faster, being written purely in C and with no Cython-related overhead.  The old implementation in Sage required a function call for every indirection to the proxied object (albeit a `cpdef` function).  The `lazy_object_proxy` implementation in principle also has a plain C function call ([Proxy__ensure_wrapped](https://github.com/ionelmc/python-lazy-object-proxy/blob/master/src/lazy_object_proxy/cext.c#L58)), but with typical compiler optimizations this is actually eliminated entirely for the common case where the proxied object has been initialized.  I haven't done any benchmarks though, but could if requested.

* Maintainer is an active member of the Python community and not likely to abandon the project or disappear (hard to quantify of course, but he's someone whose work I'm familiar with).

### Cons

* Effectively same amount of code to maintain if we ever need upstream changes for Sage--upstream can be more difficult to deal with than fixing code in Sage.

That said, the implementation of `lazy_object_proxy` is very generic and not likely to require deep changes for Sage.  The old `LazyImport` has never required deep structural changes either.

Depends on #22792

Right, I do agree that the implementation of the lazy import mechanism (`lazy_import`) and the lazy object (`class LazyImport`) is mostly orthogonal. But it's also not 100% orthogonal, and the details might matter.

> What do you mean, in this case, by "works with Cython"?

As I wrote on #22752, an implementation of the lazy import mechanism which works equally well for Python and Cython.

> * This solution is *probably* faster

Arithmetic is actually about a factor 3 slower...

With #22755:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport; sage.all.one = 1; a = LazyImport('sage.all', 'one'); timeit('a+a', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 81.1 ns per loop
```

With #22793:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport; sage.all.one = 1; a = LazyImport('sage.all', 'one'); timeit('a+a', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 220 ns per loop
```

To be honest, this surprised me too. Maybe it's because of the Python subclass `LazyImport` on top of `Proxy`?

For completeness, with vanilla Sage 8.0.beta0:

```
sage: from sage.misc.lazy_import import LazyImport; sage.all.one = 1; a = LazyImport('sage.all', 'one'); timeit('a+a', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 175 ns per loop
```

If I understand things correctly, the factory function should only be called *once* for a given object, so that shouldn't matter.

<div id="comment:11" align="right">comment:11</div>

The overhead from the Python subclass is significant:

```
sage: from lazy_object_proxy import Proxy
sage: class PyProxy(Proxy): pass
sage: def factory(): return 1
sage: a = Proxy(factory); timeit('a+a', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 82.7 ns per loop
sage: a = PyProxy(factory); timeit('a+a', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 222 ns per loop
```

So, the `Proxy` is equally fast as `LazyImport`, but the additional Python subclass makes it a lot slower.

I see where the slowdown is happening: In the `Proxy_Add` function (and other numerical methods) it does a `PyObject_IsInstance` check on the operands to see if they are proxy objects (just as in the existing implementation in Sage).  For the base class this isn't a problem because it's just a pointer comparison.  For a subclass, however, it has to go through the full recursive isinstance check.

Unfortunately, for inexact matches `PyObject_IsInstance` is a lot more complicated than that due to the need to support `__instancecheck__`.  That would *definitely* account for the amount of slowdown.

`PyObject_TypeCheck` works more like you seem to be expecting.  I could probably speed it up even a tad more for direct inheritance with a direct check of `tp_base` but it's probably not worth it.
