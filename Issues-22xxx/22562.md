This ticket
- provides a trivial `Polyhedron_base.integral_points_count` implementation that delegates to `integral_points`
- moves the LattE-based `integral_points_count` implementation to `Polyhedron_QQ`
- adds preprocessing (bounds tightening) to it and uses explicit enumeration when that is expected to be faster

<a id='comment:16'></a>Dear Matthias,

Having in mind the doc description of `integral_hull`, I do not really get the following output,

```
sage: Polyhedron([ (1/3,2/3), (3/3, 4/3) ]).bounding_box(integral_hull=True)
((1, 1), (1, 1))
```

The polyhedron does not have integral points but it returns a box, which is just a point in this case and is not contained in the polytope. I guess this is just because the example is too small to interpret the utility of `bounding_box`, so it's okay...

Probably the description of `integral_hull` in the doc should then be adapted/rephrased to say that it returns the integral hull of a bounding box, because it is confusing with the example... maybe add a "seealso" to point to `integral_points` to explain the usage of that parameter?

Otherwise, it looks good to me!
