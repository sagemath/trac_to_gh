As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36185/two-ways-of-integrating-x-xnsinx-give-contradictory-results-bug/), the commands

```
var('n')
assume(n,'integer')
integral(x^n*sin(x),x)
```

produce the output

```
1/4*(((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, I*x) - ((-1)^n - 1)*gamma(n + 1, -I*x))*(-1)^(-1/2*n)
```

which is identically zero for `n` even. Possibly an issue with branches of exponential integrals. Possibly related to #17968.

Upstream: **Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.**
