```
The spkg-install script for functools32 uses `-n` for a `not` operator; it should instead use `!`.

Before the fix, I see this in the log file:

```
./spkg-install: line 9: [: -x: binary operator expected
```
This error is ignored, and indeed, the whole if block is ignored.

The proposed change in #22582 is better, especially since we now install both python 2 and python 3 by default. Here is a branch with just that change, or we can see if #22582 gets positively reviewed, in which case this will be a duplicate.
