The spkg-install script for functools32 uses `-n` for a `not` operator; it should instead use `!`.

Before the fix, I see this in the log file:

```
./spkg-install: line 9: [: -x: binary operator expected
```
This error is ignored, and indeed, the whole if block is ignored.

Component: **packages: standard**
