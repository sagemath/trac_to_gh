I found it possibly desirable to split up the `sage_setup.docbuild.__init__` module a bit, as it was getting a bit long and difficult to reason about.  As to exactly what was moved where, this is highly subjective and open to debate.  But I do think that overall this makes the code easier to understand.

I had a couple additional motivations for this:

It is with an eye toward #6389.  I think organizing the code more clearly will make it easier to implement this--in fact I don't think there's a lot left to do except to replace every reference to `SAGE_DOC_SRC` with a reference to a source directory option.  #21732 may play a role here as well.

Speaking of #21732, I have some ideas for how to use this to further reduce runtime dependency on sage_setup.

I don't remember ever getting anything like that in testing, but I'll have to try it again.  It's possible I made some other minor changes after testing and then forgot to re-test.  I don't remember.

Anyways, to answer your question yes this is just a reorganization and does not (modulo bugs) make any changes in functionality.

This is almost certainly due to docbuilding in parallel. Remember that single-process and multi-process docbuilding now take a different code path.

Right, that could be why I did't get it.  Though I thought docbuilding was in parallel by default.  I was testing this on Linux too.  Oh well, no matter.  It's a simple fix.

1. Why this?

```
try:
    from sage.interfaces.gap import set_gap_memory_pool_size
    set_gap_memory_pool_size(80 * 1024 * 1024)
except ImportError:
    pass
```
If you really want this to work without Sage, I would prefer to see

```
try:
    import sage
except ImportError:
    pass
else:
    from sage.interfaces.gap import set_gap_memory_pool_size
    set_gap_memory_pool_size(80 * 1024 * 1024)
```

2. All functions in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/__init__.py` lack doctests.

If that's the case, that's a bug and we want to know about it. Hiding a bug inside an `except` statement is not good style.

Do you plan to use the docbuilder outside of Sage? If not, there is no reason for the `try`/`except`.

Let me say that I honestly want to move forward with this ticket. It would a pity to have this ticket stalled again. So even if I disagree with a minor thing, I might accept it anyway.

That depends.  It's not necessarily hiding a "bug" in this case.  That said, I don't remember the exact reason it was needed so changing this *might* be fine.  I just don't see why it matters.

Yes, that's part of the point of this refactoring, as well as #21732.  I don't *personally* plan to use it, but it should be made more independent of Sage.
