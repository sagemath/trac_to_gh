Following up on #22452 (Create a Polymake pexpect interface):

As suggested by Gawrilow in https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=544, we could create a variant of the polymake pexpect interface that does not go through pty's but rather replaces the relevant send/receive methods of pexpect by calls to `simulate_shell_input` (linking to libpolymake). 

Recent polymake versions have developed this further and now provide a class `polymake::Main` with convenient access to the polymake interpreter. We use the (partial) Python bindings for this, https://github.com/polymake/JuPyMake which are used for Polymake's jupyter.

Upstream package:

```
  wget -P upstream https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/32/dd/0a48546daa2461e57207d31eeb64a3ad77fd9fb339d90e1e067ea25991a5/JuPyMake-0.9.tar.gz
```

We do want to keep the current pty-based pexpect interface, though, because it may be handy for running polymake on a remote server; or for guarding against a crashing polymake (sigh). 

Remaining issue: #27807

+Following up on #22452 (Create a Polymake pexpect interface):
+
+As suggested by Gawrilow in https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=544, we could create a variant of the polymake pexpect interface that does not go through pty's but rather replaces the relevant send/receive methods of pexpect by calls to `simulate_shell_input` (linking to libpolymake).

After the lrs fix on #27803, one of these 2 errors is still present:

```
File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py", line 175, in sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base._sage_input_
Failed example:
    P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='polymake') # optional - polymake
Expected nothing
Got:
     gmp v.6.1
```

I think it is deterministic, and occurs on the 1st invocation of the polymake interface.
Try starting Sage and running

```
P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]], backend='polymake')
```
repeatedly.

No, there are two interface classes, which both work. `PolymakeExpect` (aliases to `Polymake`) and `PolymakeJupyMake`.
Depending on whether you have jupymake, `polymake` is set to an instance of one or the other.
