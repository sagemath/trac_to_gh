Some functions are handled with some flags in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/function.cpp#L1581

This should be extended (in Pynac) and doctests added (here). This ticket should list which questions can be answered definitely to the positive. To start:

- f(real).is_real() for f in sin/cos/tan/cot/sec/csc

Depends on #22219

The gamma function

```

You might also want to deal with `is_positive` which would be easily handled for analytic functions whose power series have non-negative coefficients.

Are there flags in ginac for properties like: "power series with non-negative coefficients", "power series with integer coefficients", etc?

Not possible. Taylor series are determined in general by differentiation. There is no builtin formula which we can inspect.

Yes.

Nice! Could you add doctest to check

1) compatibility with assumptions

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: cos(x).is_real()
```

2) complex stuff is actually `False`

```
cos(I).is_real()
sin(2 - I).is_real()
etc
```

3) What is the current status of?

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: (cos(x) + 1).is_positive()
```
