Some functions are handled with some flags in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/master/ginac/function.cpp#L1581

This should be extended (in Pynac) and doctests added (here). This ticket should list which questions can be answered definitely to the positive. To start:

- f(real).is_real() for f in sin/cos/tan/cot/sec/csc

The gamma function

```
sage: gamma(pi).is_real()
False
```

You might also want to deal with `is_positive` which would be easily handled for analytic functions whose power series have non-negative coefficients.

Are there flags in ginac for properties like: "power series with non-negative coefficients", "power series with integer coefficients", etc?

Nice! Could you add doctest to check

1) compatibility with assumptions

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: cos(x).is_real()
```

2) complex stuff is actually `False`

```
cos(I).is_real()
sin(2 - I).is_real()
etc
```

3) What is the current status of?

```
sage: x = SR.var('x')
sage: assume(x, 'real')
sage: (cos(x) + 1).is_positive()
```
