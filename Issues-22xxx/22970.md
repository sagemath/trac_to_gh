While I update my develop branch and check the ticket out, could you check that that the docstring in the determinant method is correct? In ``algorithm``, I see ``None`` missing.

Also, do you happen to have timings? that compare with the previous implementation? Otherwise I can produce some...

<a id='comment:12'></a>Hi Marc,

Thanks for proposing the review! I need some more work on my branch as I have strange failing doctests in `sage/modular` that I don't understand right now.

I will provide proper timings for the following methods (tell me if you have more in mind):
- `determinant`
- `multiplication`
- `echelonize`
- `charpoly` (not yet in flint, but can go through integer matrices)
- `minpoly` (not yet in flint, but can go through integer matrices)

I did not do proper tunings (since I will redo it after #22924 anyway). However, I can try to do something better for `echelon_form/echelonize`. Do you have other relevant examples in mind?

<a id='comment:23'></a>Some remarks
- flint has several algorithms for echelon form and this is not finely tuned.
- On very specific instances, multimodular can be much faster (up to x100). This is the reason why your example `CuspForms(101,12).hecke_matrix(3)` gets slower. I have no idea how to detect such instances.
- for `random_matrix(QQ, ...)` (ie independent entries) flint looks like to be the best option excepted in the range `10 <= nrows=ncols <= 20` where flint tuning (over Z) is very bad

One way to go might be to have a global option that controls the default behavior of the echelon form. I am thinking of something that can be used like

```python
def my_modular_form_algorithm():
    with rational_echelon_form('multimodular'):
        # some relevant code here
        ....
```
What do you think?

sage: %time A = ModularSymbols(11,60).hecke_matrix(3)
```

2) While reviewing, in `sage/modular/hecke/module.py` there is a doctest that changed in a suspicious way. It seems that a number field was created with a different generator and that causes the output to look different. I propose that the line that causes trouble gets changed into

```
sage: [o.minpoly() for o in A.system_of_eigenvalues(3)]
[x - 1, x + 1, x^2 - 2*x - 2]
```

The output that appears should not depend on the implementation.

3) There seems to be quite a mess on what are the acceptable values to the 'algorithm' parameter. Maybe it's a good time to change that! My suggestion would be that the default would always be None, and then the docstring would specify what is done in this case.
