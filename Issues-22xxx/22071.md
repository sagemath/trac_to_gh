With commit `a5a1e2b76332d136936c7cbe94cf42f93ec6203d` from ticket #22029:

```
sage: Mod(2,7)/x
2/x
sage: latex(Mod(2,7)/x)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for 'lt': 'Ring of integers modulo 7' and 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1'
```

It looks like Pynac is comparing the numerator with `I` under the hood. Even if the branch in question isn't merged, this is likely to cause problems sooner or later.
