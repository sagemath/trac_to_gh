Apart from my previous comments, by the way, the patch is fine with me.

I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

Since we do not currently support anything but the trivial module, this won't be a problem to change at a later point. However, there is a slight technical issue of left vs. right in that the *co*homology should be a left **g**-module, but the homology is a right **g**-module. This would be something that would eventually be taken care of when general coefficient modules are implemented.

I added options to compute using sparse matrices (as I believe the matrices for the chain complex will generally be sparse) and to do the differential computation in parallel.

Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).
