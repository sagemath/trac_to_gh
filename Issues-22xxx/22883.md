The module case is waiting for a framework for Lie algebra modules, or do we have that already?

Apart from my previous comments, by the way, the patch is fine with me.

However, there is a slight technical issue of left vs. right in that the *co*homology should be a left **g**-module, but the homology is a right **g**-module. This would be something that would eventually be taken care of when general coefficient modules are implemented.\n\nI added options to compute using sparse matrices (as I believe the matrices for the chain complex will generally be sparse) and to do the differential computation in parallel.\n\n> Another reference: 10.1.3--10.1.6 of Loday's Cyclic Homology.

The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).",

Replying to [darij](#comment%3A4):
> The doc of ChainComplex ( http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html ) says that the syntax you're invoking ChainComplex with ("a list/tuple/iterable of the form [d0,d1,d2,...] where each di is a matrix") only makes sense if degree is 1; but your degree is -1. Are you sure that this is legit? (I don't know ChainComplex well, so this is just a question.)


I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

> The doc for cohomology uses left g-modules, whereas you have defined the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for right g-modules. Of course, g being a Lie algebra, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between those, but signs may get messed up. This is not a problem when the module is trivial, but it's worth checking that we aren't making something that will be a pain to deprecate.


Since we do not currently support anything but the trivial module, this won't be a problem to change at a later point. However, there is a slight technical issue of left vs. right in that the *co*homology should be a left **g**-module, but the homology is a right **g**-module. This would be something that would eventually be taken care of when general coefficient modules are implemented.

I added options to compute using sparse matrices (as I believe the matrices for the chain complex will generally be sparse) and to do the differential computation in parallel.

> Another reference: 10.1.3--10.1.6 of Loday's Cyclic Homology. He uses the opposite signs, though. Convention differences?


Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).
