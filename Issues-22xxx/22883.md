The module case is waiting for a framework for Lie algebra modules, or do we have that already?

Apart from my previous comments, by the way, the patch is fine with me.

The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).",

> The doc of ChainComplex ( http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/homology/sage/homology/chain_complex.html ) says that the syntax you're invoking ChainComplex with ("a list/tuple/iterable of the form [d0,d1,d2,...] where each di is a matrix") only makes sense if degree is 1; but your degree is -1. Are you sure that this is legit? (I don't know ChainComplex well, so this is just a question.)


I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

> The doc for cohomology uses left g-modules, whereas you have defined the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for right g-modules. Of course, g being a Lie algebra, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between those, but signs may get messed up. This is not a problem when the module is trivial, but it's worth checking that we aren't making something that will be a pain to deprecate.


Since we do not currently support anything but the trivial module, this won't be a problem to change at a later point. However, there is a slight technical issue of left vs. right in that the *co*homology should be a left **g**-module, but the homology is a right **g**-module. This would be something that would eventually be taken care of when general coefficient modules are implemented.

I added options to compute using sparse matrices (as I believe the matrices for the chain complex will generally be sparse) and to do the differential computation in parallel.

> Another reference: 10.1.3--10.1.6 of Loday's Cyclic Homology. He uses the opposite signs, though. Convention differences?


Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).
