I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).
