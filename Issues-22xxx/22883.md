I am not doing that. `chain_data` is a `dict`.

Convention difference. The differential can always be multiplied by any (invertible) scalar as `d(d(ax)) = d(a(dx)) = a d(d(x)) = 0` and scaling by a constant is homotopic to the identity map on chain complex (i.e., the resulting homology groups are isomorphic).

`@`darij I could not construct an example that was not symmetric. However, I think we are okay. The left/right difference comes from the fact that we should be taking a dual module, but we don't see that for the trivial representation. So the care will have to be taken when that implementation is done, but I don't think we have to (or even can) worry about that here.
