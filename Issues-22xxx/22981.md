Could you try with a `raise NotImplementedError` instead of the old code calling `cmp()`, similar that what we did for lazy imports in #21247.

Thinking more about it, the original branch wasn't so bad. It just replaces one call to `cmp()` with almost equivalent Python code. So I retract my comment [comment:9].
