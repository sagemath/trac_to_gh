Thinking more about it, the original branch wasn't so bad. It just replaces one call to `cmp()` with almost equivalent Python code. So I retract my comment [comment:9].

Still, if the `raise NotImplementError` works, that would be even better since it would be one less case to worry about in future tickets.
