Sorry for the weird force pushes.  Things got confused with #23344.  It should be okay now, and a fast-forward of the branch from an hour ago.

Here are a series of bugs/remarks (see also discussion on Zulip):

- the printing of the parent is not optimal
- there is an issue with precision with the computation of `x^p`
- the methods `zero` and `one` (of the parent) are not implemented
- the method `expansion` is broken
- coercion from `QQ` to a p-adic field does not always work (might be related to the previous item)
- the method `polynomial` is broken

There's still a bug with shifting:

```
sage: W.<a> = Zq(2^10,3)
sage: S.<x> = W[]
sage: OL.<pi> = W.extension(x^2 - 2*a*x + 2)
sage: OL(1) >> 1
a + pi + pi^3 + a*pi^4 + O(pi^5)
```

The last answer should be `0`, I guess.

In any case, results are not coherent:

```
sage: (OL(1) >> 1) >> 1
(a^2 + 1) + a*pi + pi^2 + O(pi^4)
sage: OL(1) >> 2
O(pi^4)

We did leave in the `_unit` debugging method for `relative_ramified_FP.pyx`.  That should either get removed or documented.

startup_modules -- 3 seconds
```
but I don't understand what's the problem.
