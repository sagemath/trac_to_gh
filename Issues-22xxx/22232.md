<div id="comment:2" align="right">Comment 2</div>

I disagree with this change:

```
-        self._lm = [R(x) for x in self._lm] # I have no idea why -- but it seems needed.
+        self._lm = [R(x) for x in self._lm]
+        # I have no idea why -- but it seems needed
```
as it breaks the association of the comment with the line in question.

I also (still) disagree with returning `NotImplemented` when the classes do not match.

Could we also remove some of the useless parentheses, such as `while (p._p != 0):`?

Just done the trivial changes.

About the NotImplemented, why do you disagree ? Python will know what to do with this answer, in principle. This is not an Error, but probably behaves more somehow like an "unknown" value.

You may have already explained, but I still see no other reasonable possibility.
