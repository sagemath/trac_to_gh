This requires various patches to upstream PARI:

- `pari_str_1.patch` and `pari_str_2.patch`: implement new `pari_str` API. Patch taken from upstream master.

- `plot_libpari.patch`: move plotting interface from gp to libPARI. Being discussed with upstream.

- `plot_svg.patch`: implement SVG plotting in libPARI. Applied upstream with significant changes.

The `pari_jupyter` package also needs to be updated to support SVG plotting:
