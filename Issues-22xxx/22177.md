This requires various patches to upstream PARI:

- `pari_str_1.patch` and `pari_str_2.patch`: implement new `pari_str` API. Patch taken from upstream master.

- `plot_libpari.patch`: move plotting interface from gp to libPARI. Being discussed with upstream.

- `plot_svg.patch`: implement SVG plotting in libPARI. Applied upstream with significant changes.

The `pari_jupyter` package also needs to be updated to support SVG plotting:

**Demo**: https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/blob/master/WP4/D4.4/demo-pari.ipynb

**Tarball**: https://pypi.python.org/packages/6d/a7/9186eeacf76f8b723915b9c745ab42a73b987e5b5296fdd4a0a7c6626800/pari_jupyter-1.2.2.tar.bz2
