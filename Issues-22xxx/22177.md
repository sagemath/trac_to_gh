This requires various patches to upstream PARI:

- `pari_str_1.patch` and `pari_str_2.patch`: implement new `pari_str` API. Patch taken from upstream master.

- `plot_libpari.patch`: move plotting interface from gp to libPARI. Being discussed with upstream.

- `plot_svg.patch`: implement SVG plotting in libPARI. Applied upstream with significant changes.

The `pari_jupyter` package also needs to be updated to support SVG plotting:

the notebook looks good, besides `ellinit("10a1")` needs some extra data I don't have installed

```

  ***   at top-level: ellinit("10a1")
  ***                 ^---------------
  *** ellinit: error opening elldata file: `/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/share/pari/elldata/ell0'.
```
(well, this is not relevant to this ticket).

Tonight I'll see how this goes on OSX, and hopefully it's good to go then.

As documented in the demo notebook, that's on purpose, to show that error handling works fine. There is no curve called `10a1`, so installing a database won't help.
