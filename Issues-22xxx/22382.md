Currently, `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets` has an option to be a facade parent, but the category framework, and hence the coercion framework, does not know it is a facade parent. This can lead to test suite failures and some other unexpected behaviors, such as not being able to create elements. In particular, this causes problems noted on #22029.
