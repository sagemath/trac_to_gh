Tickets #22497 and #22522 provide a generic interface to latte. It is hence possible to computate multivariate generating series

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.latte import count
sage: P = polytopes.cuboctahedron()
sage: cddin = P.cdd_Vrepresentation()
sage: count(cddin, cdd=True, raw_output=True, multivariate_generating_function=True)
```
This ticket provides a direct method to polytope to access this information.
