Frédéric, you probably have read http://python-future.org/unicode_literals.html

Have you thought about changing the cython language_level (see ticket:22214#comment:4) when using cython for python3, so using `unicode_literals` might be unnecessary.

*When compiling Cython code with language level 3, the str type is identified with exactly the Unicode string type at Cython compile time, i.e. it does not identify with bytes when running in Python 2.* (https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html)

This triggers an amusing infinite loop in `CartanType`:

```
File "/home/u1/chapoton/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/root_system/cartan_type.py", line 708, in __call__
        return type_reducible.CartanType([ CartanType(subtype) for subtype in t ])

I am pretty sure it is because of the check

```
        if isinstance(t, str):
```
in `CartanTypeFactory.__call__` and not recognizing it as unicode, so it continues on, then tries to split it up as a reducible type, which then repeats the process because it is a unicode string (which is iterable). So this will recurse indefinitely for any input when you iterate over it, you get the same type of object.

Looking at #23372, I don't think that it makes sense to support `unicode_literals` everywhere. In functions which do non-trivial text handling, unicode should be supported. But for simple things like `QQ[u'x']`, I don't see the point.
