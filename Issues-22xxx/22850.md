Sage interfaces its Heaviside function with a Maxima function named `hstep` which seems to implement the same function. However, there is no documentation on it, and it is not supported in Runge-Kutta DE computations, nor in integration. This leads to mathematically wrong results when calling `desolve_rk4()` and `integrate()` with expressions containing `heaviside` (but it's working with `unit_step`).

The ticket should either replace `hstep` with `unit_step` in the Maxima interfaces, or remove it altogether with a warning. Alternatively, use `substitute_function` in `desolve_rk4()` and `integrate()`. Additionally, the issue with `hstep` should be reported upstream.

i am curious about the 2nd alternative: remove it altogether with a warning. does it mean that we can write a custom integrate method that fixes integration etc and symbolics? 

because if you compare with the similar problematic behaviour with the dirac delta:

```
sage: integrate(dirac_delta(x-1)*sin(x), x, 0, 2, algorithm='maxima')  # ??
integrate(dirac_delta(x - 1)*sin(x), x, 0, 2)
sage: integrate(dirac_delta(x-1)*sin(x), x, 0, 2, algorithm='sympy')  # ok
sin(1)
```

then in this other case there is no other "dirac delta" that can be used as backup, in analogy to the unit step. hence in this case i have the impression that the 2nd alternative is the only choice, isn't it?

It would be if the result (the unevaluated integral) was mathematically wrong, but it's not, so it's not a bug.

Recognition works even in Python:

```
sage: (1 + sin(dirac_delta(x))).has(dirac_delta(SR.wild()))
True
```
Changing the integrator would be done in `src/sage/symbolic/integration/integral.py`. Why not?

Interestingly Sage does not define the Heaviside step function at `0`. However, one subtle consequence of this is change is that it changes the value for Maxima at `0` Before, we had

```
sage: maxima(heaviside(0))
1/2
```
and now we have

```
sage: maxima(heaviside(0))
0
```
From reading the wiki page, this can matter for some applications. This fixes how I think most people will use this (i.e., as a distribution as part of an integration problem), but there seems to be a bug in the conversion code that we should fix instead.

I am comparing the following two:

```
sage: integrate(heaviside(x), x, -1, 1, algorithm='maxima')
sage: integrate(sin(cos(x)), x, -1, 1, algorithm='maxima')
```
In `sr_to_max`, both of these add something to the `*_op_dict`. In the latter case, it is `%SIN` but in the former it is `$HSTEP`. When it tries to convert back from `%HSTEP`, it cannot find it. This leads to an error when integrating.

Interestingly enough, if I do `unit_step`, then what gets passed back from ECL is `$UNIT_STEP`.

With your proposed fix, I get an error:

```
sage: integrate(sin(cos(heaviside(x))), x, -1, 1, algorithm='maxima')
sage: integrate(sin(cos(unit_step(x))), x, -1, 1, algorithm='maxima') # Boom
```
Very roughly speaking, this is because Sage realizes that something is wrong with the round trip because it ends up in a difference place then where it started. Hence, I don't think we can use this approach.

Something very subtle is going on:

```
sage: heaviside(x)._maxima_lib_().ecl()
<ECL: ((%HSTEP SIMP) |$_SAGE_VAR_x|)>
sage: integrate(heaviside(x), x, -1, 1, algorithm='maxima')
integrate(heaviside(x), x, -1, 1)
```
This "works" (the fact it cannot simplify the integral is quite bad on Maxima's part IMO, but that is a separate issue upstream) because it sets the correct conversion name. I am not sure if it is on our side, but this suggests that it is.
