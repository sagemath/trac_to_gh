This ticket is a compagnon of #22817 which updates cryptominisat package to 5.0.1. Since our current cython interface does not work with cryptominisat 5, we have to rewrite the interface to use the python bindings that are now provided by cryptominisat.

Why two tickets then?

Can you add any/all of the following to the new module `cryptominisat.py` ?

```
# Support of Python 3
from __future__ import division, absolute_import, print_function, unicode_literals
```

My mac OSX is still compiling the newest version of Sage...

Well, they do not really depend on each other, #22818 depends on #22817, but since the current interface was not working anymore, i wanted to make clear to the release manager that #22817 should not be considered until #22818 get a positive review.

Moreover, while i was pretty confident to be able to package cryptominisat 5 (and let it work with cmake), it was not clear to me whether i will be the author of the current ticket, i was first planning to contact Martin Albrecht top help there, but change after change, i could do something acceptable.

I will do this.

You can try:

```
find -name '*cryptominisat*'
```

and

```
find -name '*cryptosat*'
```

Done for cryptominisat.

It is less easy for LP solver, since `SAT` will need a `solver` option to decide between cryptominisat and LP, and then another `solver` option to decide which MILP backend to use. Moreover, the `SatLP` input tells about a `solver` option, but then it does not pass it to `MixedIntegerLinearProgram()`. In any case, this will be for another ticket since it does not concerns cryptominisat.

Indeed, I was confusing with #22999.

Should #22999 be a dependency of #22818, since it is now necessary for some versions of osx?

<a id='comment:55'></a>I builded the documentation but I can't find cryptominisat doc in the reference manual:

`sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat` should be listed in `src/doc/en/reference/sat/index.rst` in the following section:

```
Details on Specific Solvers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   sage/sat/solvers/satsolver
   sage/sat/solvers/dimacs
   sage/sat/solvers/sat_lp
.. optional - cryptominisat
.. sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat/cryptominisat
.. sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat/solverconf
```

In the same file, is the following paragraph still up to date?

```
Furthermore, Sage provides a C++ interface to the *CryptoMiniSat* [CMS]_
SAT solver which can be used interchangably with DIMACS-based solvers, but also
provides advanced features. For this last solver, the optional CryptoMiniSat
package must be installed, this can be accomplished by typing the following in the
shell::

    sage -i cryptominisat sagelib
```

In `cryptominisat.py`, it should be ```` instead of `'` :

```
    - 'confl_limit' -- an integer (default: ``None``). Abort after this many
      conflicts. If set to ``None``, never aborts.
```

Similar problem some lines below (I think this one should break the doc building) :

```
    - ``filename'' - ...
```

In input blocks, `-` should be changed to `--` to adhere to the sage convention (several instances):

```diff
-        - ``decision`` - accepted for compatibility with other solvers, ignored.
+        - ``decision`` -- accepted for compatibility with other solvers, ignored.
```

Remove the empty line here:

```
+            sage: from sage.sat.solvers.cryptominisat import CryptoMiniSat
+            sage: solver = CryptoMiniSat()                                  # optional - cryptominisat
+
+            sage: solver.nvars()                                            # optional - cryptominisat
+            0
```

Finaly, I would replace the top paragraph:

```diff
-This solver relies on Python bindings provided by upstream cryptominisat, and
-replaces the cython interface (written by Martin Albrecht in 2012) that does not
-work with recent versions of cryptominisat anymore.
-
-The ``cryptominisat`` package should be installed on your Sage installation.
-
-AUTHORS:
-
-- Thierry Monteil (2017): first version
+This solver relies on Python bindings provided by upstream cryptominisat.
+
+The ``cryptominisat`` package should be installed on your Sage installation.
+
+AUTHORS:
+
+- Thierry Monteil (2017): replaced the cython interface that does not work 
+   with version >=5.0 of cryptominisat anymore.
+- Martin Albrecht (2012): first version
```

Finally, no dot in the title:

```diff
-CryptoMiniSat Solver.
+CryptoMiniSat Solver
```
