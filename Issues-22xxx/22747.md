When using the Cython compiler directive `binding=True`, Cython uses a custom type to implement functions and methods. This custom type supports more Python features. The most important changes lie in `inspect` support.

We find several Cython bugs regarding `binding=True`:
- https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1658 (not an issue for Sage)
- https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/1724 (see #23155)
- https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/1728 (see #23155)
