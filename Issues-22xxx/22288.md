It would be nice to be able to change the size of arrow heads in directed graphs:

```
G=digraphs.Complete(3)
G.show(arrowsize=1)
```

The option arrowsize is not passed through to arrow2d, unlike other options as edge_thickness for example.

Component: **graphics**

Keywords: **digraph, plot, arrow head, size**
