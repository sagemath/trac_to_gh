Currently we build packages, in most cases, by setting `--prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL` (in `./configure`, or the equivalent in non-autoconf packages), and then installing directly to that prefix.

This is fine to keep as is.  But with automake packages we can also set `DESTDIR` (https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/DESTDIR.html#DESTDIR) to an alternative (typically temporary) directory into which to install.  This has a couple advantages:

* Although it's not as usual for `make install` to fail after a successful `make`, it *can* happen. This prevents messy partial installs in the case of a failed `make install` run.

* It gives us the opportunity to make an exact list of the files that were installed.  This is a prerequisite to improving package uninstallation/reinstallation in sage-dist (see #22510).

This is also standard operating procedure in most other packaging systems, so it would be good for Sage to adopt too.  The general approach is the same as that used for converting an arbitrary Makefile to support this convention--everywhere a file is installed, prefix the installation path with `$(DESTDIR)` (or in this case a variable we'll call `$SAGE_DESTDIR`).

For packages that already support the `DESTDIR` convention, then, we pass `DESTDIR=$SAGE_DESTDIR` to `make install`.  It is also already possible for Python packages (e.g. `pip install --root`).

Since the introduction of the build helper scripts in #23160, it makes the most sense to make these changes directly in the helper scripts, and then update more packages to use those helper scripts where possible.

Dependent tickets:

* #24106 - implement the basic functionality of supporting staged installs through `sage-spkg`
* #24024 - update more `spkg-build/install` scripts to use the `sdh_` helper functions, since that is the fastest way to add `DESTDIR` support for many packages.
* #24646 - add support for `--root=${SAGE_DESTDIR}` to Python spkgs
* #24645 - add support for post-install scripts; this can be useful for cases where, for example, local files are generated after the package is installed, or to handle cases where one file is shared by multiple packages and needs to be updated when a package that uses it is installed (see e.g. ticket:22510#comment:5)
* #????? - convert all spkgs to support staged-install; for many packages this can be covered by using the helper functions, but some packages require additional steps; in particular, packages that have files that are manually copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL`, rather than through a standard installer

Actually, I think I'm going to rename `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` to `$SAGE_DESTDIR` for consistency with the DESTDIR convention. I think that makes it clear what it's for.  Then the `$SAGE_DESTDIR$SAGE_LOCAL` combination can be called `$SAGE_DESTDIR_LOCAL`.

Actually on second thought, there was a reason for this: The idea was that if `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` isn't set then installation straight into `$SAGE_LOCAL` will still work.  The way this works currently is `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` is set by `sage-spkg` which handles the details of how to copy from the temporary install path into SAGE_LOCAL, and record the file manifest.

But if you're just running a package's spkg-install directly, then `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` is not set.  With #23179 in place I could make it so that `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` is always set in the script wrappers.  But I'm not necessarily sure that's desirable, since if you're running the script outside of sage-spkg the implementation details of staged installation are not meaningful, and it may be more useful to install directly into SAGE_LOCAL assuming it's for testing purposes.  Of course, one can always manually pass in a value for `$SAGE_INST_TEMP`.

So I think it would be better *not* to combine `$SAGE_INST_TEMP$SAGE_LOCAL` into a single variable, unless others are convinced that there is no use case for installing without `$SAGE_INST_TEMP` set.

(I do still want to rename it `$SAGE_DESTDIR`--in this way it is used quite analogously to the way `$(DESTDIR)` is used in Makefiles.)

I think that, pending #23160, this is basically ready.  I've tested it quite extensively myself on Linux and Cygwin and haven't encountered any more obvious problems.

The only exception would be that there are still some packages that write files that clobber each other, but they are only cases of optional/experimental packages clobbering standard packages, or optional/experimental packages clobbering each other.  These include:

* openblas / atlas

However, these incompatibilities were already the status quo.

On OS X, I get this with the `patch` package:

```
cp: illegal option -- u
usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file target_file
       cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file ... target_directory
cp: illegal option -- u
usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file target_file
       cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file ... target_directory
Successfully installed patch-2.7.5
```
A little later the same error causes yasm not to be installed, so mpir won't install:

```
[mpir-3.0.0.p0] configure: error: no system-wide yasm found
```
In addition to fixing the `cp` command in `sage-spkg`, should you also check for errors after executing commands like this so as to avoid "Successfully installed patch-2.7.5" when it didn't actually successfully install?

It's odd that some of the modules succeeded while others failed.

I see.  This probably means that some `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` or similar needs to be set in order for Python being run out of the source tree to link with the correct libpython.

Thanks for your testing / patience--I need to bother nthiery to get me an OSX machine I can test on so that this will be easier in the future.

Other than this Python thing I don't anticipate too many other issues with this.  The only reason Python is being stubborn is that I made a somewhat non-trivial change to how the Python self-tests are performed.  Very few of the other packages otherwise have significant changes to how they're installed (though a few do).

Python has also always been finicky to install on OS X. Anyway, imitating what was there already for linux works on this machine: adding

```
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="."
fi
```
right before `echo "Testing importing of various modules..."`, for example, fixed both `python2` and `python3`.

Other issues: this one is strange and non-repeatable, but I saw this once with maxima:

```
Found local metadata for maxima-5.39.0.p0
Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
ImportError: No module named site
************************************************************************
Error downloading maxima-5.39.0.tar.gz
************************************************************************
```
In this case, the maxima tarball had already been downloaded to the `upstream` directory. When I ran "make" again, it went smoothly. I don't know if this is worth investigating.

More importantly, I get build errors with `gsl` and `numpy`. For `gsl`:

```

```
I don't know why it seems to be looking for `libopenblas_haswell-r0.2.19.dylib` in the temporary directory; the command invoking `./configure` has the correct `--prefix` and `--libdir`.

For `numpy`:

I don't get any of these problems.  I will probably need an OSX machine to investigate.

It could have something to do with the

```
LIBS="`pkg-config --libs-only-l cblas` -lm"
```
passed to `configure` in gsl's spkg-install.  But that *shouldn't* be a problem.

Rebased on the latest (positively reviewed) #23160.

I added the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` fix needed for Python installation.

Also added an *untested* possible fix for the gsl installation issue.  I think the issue here was a bug in OpenBLAS's Makefile on OSX with how it uses `install_name_tool`, and this should fix it but I'm not positive.  Chances are this would also fix the problem with numpy which is probably trying to link (unsuccessfully) to openblas.

All those packages worked before. If such clobbering is no longer allowed, I consider that a regression introduced by this ticket.

On the topic of the other SAGE_CHECK failures, the problem is probably similar to the problems I was having with Python: The checks are being performed before the files are installed from `SAGE_DESTDIR` into `SAGE_LOCAL`, so at the very least it might be necessary to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH/DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH`, but possibly other paths as well?

Rather than trying to fix every `spkg-check`, which may be difficult especially if I can't reproduce all the problems, it might be better for the sake of this ticket if I moved execution of `spkg-check` until after installation to `SAGE_LOCAL`.  This has the downside that the package still gets installed even if the check failed, but that's the existing situation anyways.

Just realized I never replied to this.  `DESTDIR=` is added in the helper function `sdh_make_install` (which is partly why I wanted that feature implemented for this ticket).  Note that it assumes `SAGE_DESTDIR` is set, which it may not be if the `spkg-install` is not being run from `sage-spkg`.  It might be worth noting that this is intentional--if `SAGE_DESTDIR` is left blank then direct installation to `SAGE_LOCAL` proceeds as normal, which is important and useful for testing, if nothing else. 

Otherwise, `SAGE_DESTDIR` is set in `sage-spkg`, and gets passed to `make install`, in most cases, by way of `sdh_make_install`.

For some reason on Linux I couldn't reproduce the problems running the tests for flint or arb (despite running `make distclean` first).  But I did get the same problems for the other packages.  As I wrote [ticket:22509#comment:69 here] it seems to be mostly a matter of setting the required environment variables.  But I think I'll still revert to the old behavior for SAGE_CHECK for now, just to keep this simpler.

I wouldn't consider it a regression at all.  The fact that some packages overwrote files installed by other packages is a bug, just one that hasn't had very serious effects.  Most cases of this were very minor (e.g. python3 overwrote the valgrind.supp installed by python2).

True, but there's not much other way to handle it (I don't mind separating some changes out to separate tickets but some of them go hand-in-hand with this). John did test this extensively in OSX and got it working.  The only remaining concern was that some `spkg-check` tests weren't working.

Why do you think that? This doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing patch: you could first implement the general framework and then gradually fix packages.

Anyway, if you find somebody else to review this, I don't mind at all. But for me, I am quite discouraged from reviewing such a big patch. And then there is also the potential for merge conflicts if you make so many changes.

You could start with "`DESTDIR` works for a few selected packages" or "`DESTDIR` works for Python packages only"

> in a way that is likely to result in only minor conflicts at worse


A merge conflict is a merge conflict. It doesn't matter how minor it is.

It's fine--I see your point.  I think it's easier to review if one patch contains just:

* The basic structural changes
* A few motivating examples for the different cases

and then leave the remaining boilerplate changes to a separate ticket.
