On OS X, Python3 sometimes fails to build correctly. To fix this:

- make `xz` a dependency: not necessary for Python 3 to build, but this way it builds the `_lzma` module.

- use `clang` to compile Python 3, as we do for Python 2. Without this, the `_scproxy` module fails to build.

- patch `Include/pyport.h` as we do for Python 2 -- see #22147, and also https://trac.macports.org/ticket/44288 and ​http://bugs.python.org/issue10910.

- do not create a symlink `SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python` -- see #22764. If this symlink is in place and if Python 2 is built before Python 3, then Python 3 picks up that link in its load path, and so it tries to read a lot of Python 2 packages, which is bad.

- see also #22781 which tracks a few other issues related to Python 3, OS X, and Sage packages.

By the way, some of the changes were just to decrease differences between the `spkg-install` scripts for `python2` and `python3`. There is two parts in the `python2` script which is not in `python3`:

```
# Use EXTRA_CFLAGS for user-defined CFLAGS since Python puts its own
# default flags like -O3 after CFLAGS but before EXTRA_CFLAGS.
# We also disable warnings about unused variables/functions which are
# common in Cython-generated code.
export EXTRA_CFLAGS="`testcflags.sh -Wno-unused` $CFLAGS"
unset CFLAGS
```
and the lines surrounding

```
    cp -rp "${xcode}"/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift-migrator/sdk/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/openssl "$CUR"/include
```
This second one is broken even for `python2`, so no need to do it for `python3`. I don't know about the first chunk.

`fpylll` is a similar problem to https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv/issues/45. It could be linked to locale settings if I believe the last comment.
According to file, the file is ASCII, but python thinks it has utf8 in it.

yes pyport.h, I fixed that in 2.7, and the fix was added in 2.7.13 upstream. May be we need to update to python-3.5.3. see #22147.

Interesting experience. #12426 can still be tweaked, but yes we may want to prevent users to shoot themselves too much in the foot. `python` is somewhat ok because it is C and not C++ you can compile it with clang and mostly use it with gcc.

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A44):
> Interesting experience. #12426 can still be tweaked, but yes we may want to prevent users to shoot themselves too much in the foot. `python` is somewhat ok because it is C and not C++ you can compile it with clang and mostly use it with gcc. Anything that would require clang++ would be in a load of troubles.

Right now we build `python2`, `python3` (as of this ticket), `curl`, `psutil`, and `R` using clang rather than gcc, because of troubles with gcc. I'm going to disable the clang build for each of these to see what happens with my own gcc-5.4.0. I'll follow up with the results on #12426.
