Arithmetic of asymptotic expressions gets a little messed up as soon as complex powers are involved:

```
sage: n^(1+2*I) + O(n) + n^(1-2*I)
n^(2*I + 1) + O(n)
```
This is due to the lexicographic comparison of complex numbers.

Ideally, `O`-terms would automatically simplify, e.g.,

```
sage: O(n^(1+I))
O(n)
```

While the current behavior (afaik) does not produce wrong results, this would be a QoL-improvement.
