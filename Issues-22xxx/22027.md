That is a Maxima bug.

Are we ok with sage returning 1 for 0^0? This is the case in Python, but in Maxima is it undefined.

Is maxima under active development? Should we report that issue there?

Note that sympy handles this properly:

```
In [6]: sympy.simplify(0**x)
Out[6]: 0**x
```

Singular says `0^n = 0` (where `n` must be an integer):

```
CanonicalForm
power ( const CanonicalForm & f, int n )
{
  ASSERT( n >= 0, "illegal exponent" );

  if ( f.isZero() )
    return CanonicalForm(0L);
  ...
```
I would say this is clearly wrong: `x^0` needs to be `1` for all `x` if the exponent is an integer variable.

[Ask Sage question 61400](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/61400) makes me raise the priority of this one.

One should note that

- Sympy does not give an explicit 1 and returns the sum unevaluated
- Giac returns `undef`
- Mathematica raises an error claiming that `0^0` is indeterminate

Furthermore:

```
sage: sum(x^j/factorial(j),j,0,oo)
e^x
sage: sum(x^j/factorial(j),j,0,oo).limit(x=0)
1
sage: sum(x^j/factorial(j),j,0,oo).subs(x=0)
1
```

But, indeed:

```
sage: with assuming(j, "integer", j >= 0): 0^j
0^j
sage: with assuming(j, "integer", j >= 0): (0^j).simplify()
0
```

Since `simplify` does its work by passing its argument to Maxima,
and uses the returned value as a result, the ball is well in Maxima's camp...

The "maxima-discuss" mailing list had a thread last month
about zero to the zero:
