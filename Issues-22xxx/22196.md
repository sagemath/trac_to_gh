I tested with an implicit plot

```
var('x,y,z')
G = implicit_plot3d((x^2+y^2+2*z^2-1/3)^2==((z-1/2)^2-2*x^2)*((z+1/2)^2-2*y^2),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),(z,-0.5,0.5))
G.save('implicit.stl')
```

the Moebius surface 

```
from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import MoebiusStrip
S = MoebiusStrip(1,.2)
S.save('Moebius.stl')
```

and the buckyball polyhedron  

```
G = plot(polytopes.buckyball())
G.all[-1].save('buckyball.stl')
```

I looked at the saved stl files in Blender. They looked fine, normals where coherent when possible. 

One remark, unrelated to the binary format: the implicit plot had some "double points" (points very close to each other) which causes tiny triangles.
