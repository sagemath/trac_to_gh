I tested with an implicit plot

```
var('x,y,z')
G = implicit_plot3d((x^2+y^2+2*z^2-1/3)^2==((z-1/2)^2-2*x^2)*((z+1/2)^2-2*y^2),(x,-1,1),(y,-1,1),(z,-0.5,0.5))
G.save('implicit.stl')
```

the Moebius surface 

```
from sage.plot.plot3d.parametric_surface import MoebiusStrip
S = MoebiusStrip(1,.2)
S.save('Moebius.stl')
```

and the buckyball polyhedron  

```
G = plot(polytopes.buckyball())
G.all[-1].save('buckyball.stl')
```

I looked at the saved stl files in Blender. They looked fine, normals where coherent when possible. 

One remark, unrelated to the binary format: the implicit plot had some "double points" (points very close to each other) which causes tiny triangles.

so, positive review ?

For the question about tiny triangles, this would be for another ticket maybe. We are using something called a "marching cubes" algorithm. Maybe there is room for improvement, but this is not for me and not for now.

Yes, in principle.
I just had to leave home before all the doctests finished (it's sooo slooow). 
Now I am running them on the cloud, but I had to rebuilt the whole thing first, that's why it is taking some time. As soon as it's done, it will be a positive review. 

Actually, just doctesting sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx was quite fast and it worked fine. But if I understand well I am supposed to doctest everything, right ?
