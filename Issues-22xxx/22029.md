As discussed in the sage-devel thread starting with `<o21nte$6jp$1`@`blaine.gmane.org>` (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/YVFdxPH6avk/4OZUmzLHBgAJ),
`coercion_model.richcmp()` should not fall back on comparing by type/id.

This branch implements comparisons for `Element` the same way as in Python 3: a `TypeError` is raised for uncomparable objects (instead of comparing by `id`).

<a id='comment:5'></a>My main concern right now is that `sage.graphs` heavily relies on sorting lists of vertices, while various other parts of Sage create graphs with vertices that mix Elements with other Python objects.

An option might be to try again with `key=id` when `sort()` fails, but (with no global understanding of the code, at least) there's a major risk of getting inconsistent orders with different subsets of vertices.

Another idea would be to do introduce utilities like

```
# universal_cmp.pyx
cpdef lt(x, y):
    try:
        return x < y
    except TypeError:
        if type(x) is type(y):
            return id(x) < id(y)
        else:
            return type(x) < type(y)
...

cdef class key(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = value
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return lt(self.value, other.value)
    ...
```
and then use `universal_cmp.lt()` and `sort(key=universal_cmp.key)`, but this won't work either when one of the types involved only has a partial order, since this order will not be consistent with `id`.

Yet another variant would be to pass a comparison function (or, equivalently but probably better in view of the transition to python3, a `key` as above) that wraps `cmp()` and catches `TypeError`s. Not really ideal either, but at least it wouldn't introduce any regression(?), so perhaps that would be enough for this ticket...

Any advice?

If your objects are guaranteed to be hashable you could try sorting on the hash, but that will leave your results undefined when hashes clash. In any case, if you rely on \"first try what the object implements and then use a fallback if that fails\", you're doomed.\n\nIn fact, if you allow your vertices to be labelled with arbitrary objects, you're already losing transitivity of equality in sage, via the standard\n\n```\nsage: a=GF(3)(1); b =31; c=GF(5)(1)\nsage: a==b,b==c,a==c\n(True, True, False)\n```\nIt seems that labels get mangled anyway, though, so I think them not being sorted properly is only a minor concern by comparison (sorry):\n\n```\nsage: a=GF(3)(1); b =31; c=GF(5)(1)\nsage: L=[[a,b,c],[a,c,b],[b,a,c],[b,c,a],[c,a,b],[c,b,a]]\nsage: for l in L:\n....:     G=Graph()\n....:     for i in l:\n....:         G.add_vertex(i)\n....:     print [parent(j) for j in G.vertices()]\n....:     \n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]\n```\nIt seems to me the only sane approaches are to not rely on sorting (in python it seems being hashable is more ubiquitous than being sortable, so fast lookup is likely better accomplished via hash functions), or to declare that the labels are sortable (making failure a user error).\n\nThis stuff causes real problems: since the old python interface for `__cmp__` methods required one to provide non-errors for \"<\" and \">\" testing if one wants to implement \"==\", sage is riddled with apparent implementations of orderings that are in actuality inconsistent. This has cause problems in at least one case, where labels in published tables of elliptic curves were based on non-sensical but assumed-consistent ordering of number field elements:\n\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/aP5LP09sADY](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/aP5LP09sADY)\n\nThis has convinced me that the only sane approach is to deprecate \"cmp\" style interfaces as quickly as possible and instead rely on \"richcmp\", with errors for ordering if not obviously correct.",

<a id='comment:15'></a>Replying to [mmezzarobba](#comment%3A5):

If you have no information on the objects you're sorting, I don't think there is anything that can save you. If your objects are guaranteed to be hashable you could try sorting on the hash, but that will leave your results undefined when hashes clash. In any case, if you rely on "first try what the object implements and then use a fallback if that fails", you're doomed.

In fact, if you allow your vertices to be labelled with arbitrary objects, you're already losing transitivity of equality in sage, via the standard

```
sage: a=GF(3)(1); b =31; c=GF(5)(1)
sage: a==b,b==c,a==c
(True, True, False)
```
It seems that labels get mangled anyway, though, so I think them not being sorted properly is only a minor concern by comparison (sorry):

```
sage: a=GF(3)(1); b =31; c=GF(5)(1)
sage: L=[[a,b,c],[a,c,b],[b,a,c],[b,c,a],[c,a,b],[c,b,a]]
sage: for l in L:
....:     G=Graph()
....:     for i in l:
....:         G.add_vertex(i)
....:     print [parent(j) for j in G.vertices()]
....:     
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
[<type 'int'>, Integer Ring]
```
It seems to me the only sane approaches are to not rely on sorting (in python it seems being hashable is more ubiquitous than being sortable, so fast lookup is likely better accomplished via hash functions), or to declare that the labels are sortable (making failure a user error).

This stuff causes real problems: since the old python interface for `__cmp__` methods required one to provide non-errors for "<" and ">" testing if one wants to implement "==", sage is riddled with apparent implementations of orderings that are in actuality inconsistent. This has cause problems in at least one case, where labels in published tables of elliptic curves were based on non-sensical but assumed-consistent ordering of number field elements:

[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/aP5LP09sADY](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-nt/aP5LP09sADY)

This has convinced me that the only sane approach is to deprecate "cmp" style interfaces as quickly as possible and instead rely on "richcmp", with errors for ordering if not obviously correct.

But the net effect is that arithmetic that mixes `Element`s and objects of these types will succeed or fail (with an error coming from the coercion framework) depending whether there is a common parent or not.

Do you really want things like

True
sage: RBF(0) < float(-1.)
True
sage: SymmetricGroup(2)(()) != int(1)

even though it takes exactly one LOC to prevent them and analogous code with Sage `Element`s raises an error (so that, in particular, the behavior will be different for preparsed and pure Python code)?

I tend to see the situation we are talking about not as one where it can't decide, but as one where it can decide that the comparison doesn't make sense. And not to find “just follow the Python[2] convention” such a strong argument when Sage already breaks it in much worse ways...

How is it relevant whether or not Sage breaks certain Python conventions in much worse ways?

If Python specifies how to do arithmetic/comparisons, why not follow that?

When you start deviating from the general conventions, “your” objects already don't interact with the rest of the system as other developers will expect, and your job IMHO is to minimize the damage.

Now, there is no doubt that you have orders of magnitude more experience of Sage development than I'll likely ever do, so I guess I'll follow your advice even without understanding it if that's really the only way. But I'd really prefer (in general: I'm bringing this up because it is not the first time I have trouble understanding your comments) if you could explain **why** you think a certain technical choice is better instead of just stating that it is.

Pretty much everything is improvable, especially the “main” commit, but I don't think I have left anything too dirty.

The one test that fails is:

I'm not sure I understand the difference. Anyway, all commits except for the last two are intended to be independent. I didn't test them individually, though, and some probably shouldn't be merged separately without adding a test or two. Please feel free to move anything you want to separate tickets.

<a id='comment:63'></a>Apparently the failure in `integer_vector_weighted` is due to the fact that `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets(facade=True)` are parents that can construct elements whose parents differ from the parent that constructed them:

```
sage: V = WeightedIntegerVectors([2,1,3])
sage: V.an_element().parent() is V

I don't know what to do to fix the issue. Should there be a coercion from `WeightedIntegerVectors(n, w)` to `WeightedIntegerVectors_all(w)`?

<a id='comment:66'></a>I would say this is a bigger underlying problem with `DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets`. This comes from its doc:

```
sage: class MyUnion(DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets):
....:   def __init__(self):
....:       DisjointUnionEnumeratedSets.__init__(self,
....:            Family([1,2], Permutations))
sage: pp = MyUnion()
sage: pp.list()
[[1], [1, 2], [2, 1]]
```
We have

```
sage: pp.list()[0].parent()
Standard permutations of 1
```
I suspect the biggest problem comes from the fact it does pass the facade option to the category framework. I think your solution is too specific and somewhat over-engineered. While I think there should be an easy mechanism for allowing coercions when we have a non-facade parent, that seems to be tangent to the problem at hand.

The fact that this is causing a problem with a `!=` test is worrisome to me too that there is something subtle not caught by your branch. In particular, you can have `!=` that results in an error, which I strongly believe should never happen.

I also disagree with the change in `!=` test; we should at least make the `DummyParent` compare by id so the test remains valid.

I believe this fails because the `DummyParent` doesn't have comparisons.

Right. What I said there makes sense in principle in a world where only Python 2 exists.

I did not think of the Python 3 porting in that thread. Given that we are moving to Python 3, we might as well start implementing Python 3 semantics for comparisons, which means raising an error when a comparison makes no sense.

What do you mean exactly? I'm open to suggestions for improvement.

What I want is that comparisons involving the coercion model behave just like comparisons in Python 3 should behave. This means: if the objects cannot be compared, raise an error instead of returning some arbitrary value.

We had this discussion two years ago when I started this ticket, and frankly I don't remember all the details. But I think it revolved around the following points:

* Regarding coercion failures, it *might* be better to raise an error (however inconvenient that would be!)
  * instead of returning `False` when two `Element`s with no common parent are compared using `==`,
  * and, perhaps more importantly, instead of returning `True` when they are compared with `!=`—the additional point to consider in this case being that returning `True` would be “wrong” if we haven't proved that the elements are different, while many boolean predicates in Sage return `False` when they can not decide.

* Regarding non-`Element`s:
  * The coercion framework treats some specific types essentially like `Element`. We need to be consistent with that, but still allow users to define new types that implement their own comparison logic with Sage elements.
  * `richcmp()` currently does that by calling `tp_richcompare()` on the non-`Element`, instead of returning `NotImplemented`. I'm not 100% comfortable with this choice. I assume that the goal to get the same behavior under Python 2 and 3, but I'm a bit confused here, because (unless I misunderstood you) you argued against that choice two years ago.

I would argue that, when there is no common parent, elements clearly cannot be equal. This is also consistent with Python 3 where uncomparable objects can still be compared by `==` and `!=`:

```
Python 3.6.3 (default, Mar 13 2018, 19:00:30) 
[GCC 6.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1 == "x"
False
```

>   * and, perhaps more importantly, instead of returning `True` when they are compared with `!=`—the additional point to consider in this case being that returning `True` would be “wrong” if we haven't proved that the elements are different


Again, if those elements don't coerce to a common parent, they cannot be equal.

> * Regarding non-`Element`s:
>   * The coercion framework treats some specific types essentially like `Element`. We need to be consistent with that


As far as I know, we are consistent.

> but still allow users to define new types that implement their own comparison logic with Sage elements.
> * `richcmp()` currently does that by calling `tp_richcompare()` on the non-`Element`, instead of returning `NotImplemented`.


Exactly.

> I'm not 100% comfortable with this choice. I assume that the goal to get the same behavior under Python 2 and 3


Exactly. Returning `NotImplemented` causes different behavior on Python 2 and Python 3.

> I'm a bit confused here, because (unless I misunderstood you) you argued against that choice two years ago.


I don't remember precisely. Anyway, I changed my mind and I'm convinced now that raising an error is the right thing to do.
