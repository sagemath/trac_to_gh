In `sage/libs/linbox/linbox.pxd` we currently have two classes that gives an interface for dense integer matrix (`Linbox_integer_dense`) and sparse matrix over Z/nZ (`Linbox_modn_sparse`). These interfaces are then used in different matrix implementations in `sage/matrix/`.

This task ticket stands for improvement of the LinBox interface

- moving the implementation directly in `sage/matrix` without the intermediate Cython classes. In particular, avoid calling the linbox-sage interface (on LinBox side) but directly invoque LinBox C++ code (as Cython now allows it) (done in #22924 and #24544)
- more documentation and testing
- support for other matrix types (e.g. sparse integer matrix (done in #23214), interface with [m4ri](https://bitbucket.org/malb/m4ri) that Sage uses for matrix over GF(2))
- expose more algorithms
  - solving `A X = B` with `B` a matrix without repeated call
    to LinBox column by column
  - parallel features from LinBox
  - more options for computing determinant (LinBox knows how to do this in more than one way)
  - open-mp is explicitely disabled in `spkg-install` with a reference to [#17635 comment 67](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17635#comment:67)
  - fplll is explicitely disabled in `spkg-install` with a reference to #21221

Concrete ticket list

- #22924: implement a direct flint/LinBox interface and use it in `matrix_integer_dense.pyx`
- #22966: warning while compiling `element_givaro.pyx`
- #22970: use `fmpq_mat_t` for rational dense matrices
- #22971: more linbox in rational dense matrices
- #23158: LinBox patch for integer sparse linear solving
- #24544: clean declarations + matrix modn
- #23214: solve/det/rank/charpoly/minpoly for sparse integral matrices (see also #13915, #25257)
- #26178: `unsigned int` and `int64_t` behave very differently!
