```
The C++ code in `triangulations.cc` (which does not involve Cython) calls `PyInt_AS_LONG` which no longer exists in Python 3:

```
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc: In function 'triangulations* init_triangulations(int, int, int, bool, PyObject*, PyObject*)':
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc:121:41: error: 'PyInt_AS_LONG' was not declared in this scope
```

Luckily, Cython defines `PyInt_AS_LONG` as an alias of `PyLong_AS_LONG` in Python 3. So there should be no compilation issues for Cython code.

I include a branch to allow others to reproduce:

```
export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes
make build
```

One problem is that `PyInt_AS_LONG` is often used in performance-critical code.

So whatever you do **be aware of performance regressions** in this ticket. Although it could very well be that such regressions are inevitable.

Probably in python3, the result will stil be (2, 3, 4, 5).

Volker or Jeroen, any suggestion on how to have doctests working both in py2 and py3 ?

Casting these integers to Integer ? I would prefer not.

Or just use apply "str" to display the results without the trailing L ?

Well I'm not really a fan of including c++ files, thats ought to be the compiler's job. All that Cython does is 

```
#if PY_MAJOR_VERSION >= 3
  #define PyInt_FromLong               PyLong_FromLong
  #define PyInt_AsLong                 PyLong_AsLong
  #define PyInt_AS_LONG                PyLong_AS_LONG
#endif
```
I'd just put that in the offending C++ files..
