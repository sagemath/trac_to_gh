```
The C++ code in `triangulations.cc` (which does not involve Cython) calls `PyInt_AS_LONG` which no longer exists in Python 3:

```
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc: In function 'triangulations* init_triangulations(int, int, int, bool, PyObject*, PyObject*)':
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc:121:41: error: 'PyInt_AS_LONG' was not declared in this scope
```

Luckily, Cython defines `PyInt_AS_LONG` as an alias of `PyLong_AS_LONG` in Python 3. So there should be no compilation issues for Cython code.

I include a branch to allow others to reproduce:

```
export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes
make build
```
