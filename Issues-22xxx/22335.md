```
The C++ code in `triangulations.cc` (which does not involve Cython) calls `PyInt_AS_LONG` which no longer exists in Python 3:

```
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc: In function 'triangulations* init_triangulations(int, int, int, bool, PyObject*, PyObject*)':
[sagelib-7.6.beta3] sage/geometry/triangulation/triangulations.cc:121:41: error: 'PyInt_AS_LONG' was not declared in this scope
```

Luckily, Cython defines `PyInt_AS_LONG` as an alias of `PyLong_AS_LONG` in Python 3. So there should be no compilation issues for Cython code.

I include a branch to allow others to reproduce:

```
export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes
make build
```

One problem is that `PyInt_AS_LONG` is often used in performance-critical code.

So whatever you do **be aware of performance regressions** in this ticket. Although it could very well be that such regressions are inevitable.

typical failing doctest:

```
File "src/sage/geometry/triangulation/base.pyx", line 903, in sage.geometry.triangulation.base.ConnectedTriangulationsIterator
Failed example:
    next(ci)
Expected:
    (2, 3, 4, 5)
Got:
    (2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)
```
Probably in python3, the result will stil be (2, 3, 4, 5).

Volker or Jeroen, any suggestion on how to have doctests working both in py2 and py3 ?

Casting these integers to Integer ? I would prefer not.

Or just use apply "str" to display the results without the trailing L ?
