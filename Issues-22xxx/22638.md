When installing Sage with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, the symlink `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` points to `python2`. This is almost certainly caused by #22354.

This causes build-time problems like

Ops, I got confused with the local/lib/python symlink, ignore[comment:5](#comment%3A5). 

PEP394 says that "for the time being, all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2".
