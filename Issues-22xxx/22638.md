When installing Sage with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, the symlink `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python` points to `python2`. This is almost certainly caused by #22354.

This causes build-time problems like

`six` is installed as expected in `local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/six.py`. The directory `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/` is empty.
