There is a mistake in `gens = (RR.column(ncols-1)[1<<m:]).list()`
string. The rank of the system may be less than 2^m.

In that case this function doesn’t return any polynom. AES s-box has a lot of polynoms with degree=2 satisfying.

This is the minimal code to verify it. There should be much more than one polynomials (see http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36178-2_17 for example).

        TESTS:

        Check that :trac:`22453` is fixed::

            sage: from sage.crypto.sboxes import AES
            sage: aes_polys = AES.polynomials()
            sage: p = aes_polys[0].parent("x3*y0 + x5*y0 + x7*y0 + x6*y1 + x2*y2"
            ....:                         " + x3*y2 + x4*y2 + x2*y3 + x3*y3 +"
            ....:                         " x5*y4 + x6*y4 + x3*y5 + x4*y5 + x4*y7"
            ....:                         " + x2 + x3 + y2 + y3 + y4 + 1")
            sage: p in aes_polys
```
Otherwise LGTM.
