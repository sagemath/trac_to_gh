```
**Background**:

The existing function `richcmp_not_equal` can be used to compare sequences (in the broad sense, this includes polynomials and vectors) item by item. Essentially, for a sequence `A` and `B` one does:

```
for i in range(N):
    if not A[i] == B[i]:
        return richcmp_not_equal(A[i], B[i], op)
```
This is precisely the pseudocode that Python uses when comparing tuples and lists.

However, this usage of `richcmp_not_equal` makes too many assumptions. For example, it implicitly assumes that `x != y` is equivalent to `not x == y`.

**Solution**:

Instead, we propose a new function `richcmp_item` to solve the same problem in a different way. The new code becomes:

```
for i in range(N):
    res = richcmp_item(A[i], B[i], op)
    if res is not NotImplemented:
        return res
```

We implement `richcmp_item` such that the semantics are compatible with set comparisons. For non-empty sets A and B, we define A op B (where "op" is a comparison operator) as a op b for all a in A and b in B. Comparisons for elements of `RIF` are a special case of this. Now, if LA and LB are lists of sets [A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, ...] and [B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, ...] we want:

LA op LB <=> [a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, ...] op [b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ...] for all a<sub>i</sub> in A<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> in B<sub>i</sub>.

**Use case**:

This way, we fix comparisons of polynomials to address [[#22076 comment:5](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22076#comment:5)]. Ideally, this new function `richcmp_item` would be used for all comparisons of sequences.

My brain hurts a bit, but this looks reasonable to me. `:-)` Please feel free to set the ticket to positive review on my behalf if all tests pass.

You may have meant to write `(x {op} y)` in:

```
return res # (x {op} > x) --> True
```
Also, the comment:

```
....: return rich_to_bool(op, 0) # Lists are equal
```
may be misleading, because the lists actually don't have to be equal when the operator is not `==`.

It's understandable. It took me a while to come up with these semantics, but I think they are correct.

I'll fix the minor issues that you mentioned.

No, it cannot because those are legitimate return values of rich comparisons. For example, I could write

```
def __eq__(self, other):
    return None
```
and then `a == b` could return `None`.

But this is not the case for `NotImplemented`: that is special-cased by Python so it is not possible that `a == b` returns `NotImplemented`.

There somehow to ways to write the same thing

```
if something:
    return "hey"
else:
    do something else
```
or

```
if something:
    return "hey"
do something else
```
You are mixing the two ways in your code which makes it harder to read.

Yes and I tried to explain that. The point is that `richcmp_item(x, y, op)` returns either

1. `PyObject_RichCompare(x, y, op)`

2. `NotImplemented`

Since 1. can return anything *except* `NotImplemented`, the value in 2. must be `NotImplemented` if we want those cases to be disjoint.
