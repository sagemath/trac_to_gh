Sage allows to compute the inverse Laplace transform through Maxima's `ilt` function,

```
    sage: var('s t')
    sage: inverse_laplace(1/s, s, t)
    1
```

An unevaluated expression is returned when no explicit inverse Laplace transform is computed, as in

```
    sage: inverse_laplace(exp(-s)/s, s, t)
    ilt(e^(-s)/s, s, t)
```
The result in this case is h(t-1), where h is the Heaviside step function. In Sage it is available as `heaviside`.

The problem in this ticket is to extend the current behavior of `inverse_laplace` to provide explicit expressions for proper real-rational functions with any number of real exponentials linear in the transform variable s (time-shifts) in the numerator. For consistency, the direct Laplace transform with a heaviside should also work as well.

These are some approaches:

(1) Implement an in-house solution, possibly in the lines of [this answer](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36656/how-to-find-inverse-laplace-transform/).

(2) Add an `algorithm` flag that allows to choose `sympy` (similar to integration).

(3) Interface with Giac/XCAS. With this package installed, it is possible to do:

```
sage: giac('invlaplace(exp(-s)/s, s, t)')
Heaviside(t-1)
``` 

IMHO, a combination of (2)-(3) is the more robust approach. A small set of experiments show that (3) is, at the time of writing, more convenient than `inverse_laplace_transform` of SymPy in terms of quality of solution and execution time. Unfortunately, the [giac interface](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/interfaces/sage/interfaces/giac.html) does not currently support automatic translation back to the symbolic ring, as it does with SymPy objects via SR(..).

Any recommendations?

Needs info (please see commit message) to transform heaviside via `_giac_()`. Example:

```
    sage: f = heaviside(x); f, type(f)
    (heaviside(x), <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>)
    sage: fg = f._giac_(); fg,  type(fg)

But `heaviside(x)` doesn't seem to be understood by giac.

in giac it looks to be Heaviside, so you need to either translate the string or define it in giac:

```
giac("'heaviside:=Heaviside'")
sage: giac(f).integrate(x,-1,2)
2
sage: f
heaviside(x)
sage: type(f)
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```
similar with giacpy_sage which have a raw conversion to sage:

```
sage: from giacpy_sage import *
// Giac share root-directory:/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage.develop/local/share/giac/
// Giac share root-directory:/home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage.develop/local/share/giac/
Help file /home/fred-dev/sage/develop/sage.develop/local/share/giac/doc/fr/aide_cas not found
Added 0 synonyms
sage: libgiac('heaviside:=Heaviside')
'Heaviside'
sage: f=heaviside(x)
sage: fg=libgiac(f)
sage: fg.integrate(x,-1,2)
2
sage: type(fg.integrate(x,-1,2))
<type 'giacpy_sage.Pygen'>
sage: SR(fg.integrate(x,-1,2))
2
sage: type(SR(fg.integrate(x,-1,2)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: (fg.integrate(x,-1,2)).sage()
2
sage: type((fg.integrate(x,-1,2)).sage())
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```
but with Heaviside will be sent to SR as a raw string so you will need some translation back to heaviside also.

ok, good. so i suppose the correct way is to implement a basic parser, as suggested in giac.py interface (my comments in #):

```
    def _sage_(self):
        r"""
        Convert a giac expression back to a Sage expression.

        This currently does not implement a parser for the Giac output language,
        therefore only very simple expressions will convert successfully.
        Warning: List conversion is slow.
        ...

        """
        result = repr(self) # this is a string representation
        if str(self.type()) != 'DOM_LIST' :
            try:
                from sage.symbolic.all import SR
                result = giac2sage(result) # pattern matching e.g. Heaviside -> heaviside
                return SR(result)
            except Exception:
                raise NotImplementedError("Unable to parse Giac output: %s" % result)
        else:
            return [entry.sage() for entry in self]
```

a first search for this kind of conversion in some other module didn't give me anything useful yet.

for the new keyword argument's name, i would vote for `engine` instead of `algorithm`.
the former is used for example in [base.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py). the keyword `algorithm` is misleading: a given computational engine may implement different algorithms.

Not now. Perhaps a better one is `interface`, since this name is used in the code and in the documentation.

Interesting! After a first look, I don't quite understand how to use it.

I suggest that we move on with this ticket for the basic functionality described above, and to create separate tickets to enhance the symbolics with the giac interface in separate ones (also add limit, integrate, solve). If you agree we can create a new subsection "Giac interface" under https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics

Done.

Hi Frederic, 

i have a question in relation to this. In the 2nd line of `src/sage/giac.py`, there is `(You should prefer the cython interface: giacpy_sage and its libgiac command)`. Is this recommendation relevant to this ticket? 

By the way, the 2nd option above (`giacpy_sage`) in my local sage install doesn't work, clearly some package is missing (is this expected for a 'standard package'?):

```
sage: from giacpy_sage import *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c91665cb8326> in <module>()
----> 1 from giacpy_sage import *

ImportError: No module named giacpy_sage
```

A couple more remarks: I've checked for further info [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/libs/index.html) but we have no `libgiac`. In `libs/giac.py`, i didn't understand if this code is particular for Groebner basis computations, or it is meant to be used more generally. Thanks!

giacpy_sage is an optional spkg, but you should be able to install it.

All the files in interfaces are pexpect interfaces for external programs. Among them some (ex: pari, gap, singular) also have a cython interface that works with the c or C++ library directly. There was a wish to prefer the cython interface when avaible.

But as giacpy_sage is optional while giac went standard recently, and as calculus have old entries with the pexepect interface of giac, I think that it is not a problem to do work like this.
But indeed it is not natural to work on the pexpect interface too much.

the cython interface to giac is giacpy_sage and it superseeds the pexpect one, but your translation table could be imported by both. So when things will be decided I will update giacpy_sage also if it doesn't slow down conversions of huge expressions.

Where I'm seeing this error often is when an expression has extra powers of the variable of integration, as for example

```
inverse_laplace(s^2*exp(-s)/(s-1),s,t,algorithm='giac')
```

which returns a derivative of the Dirac delta. At some point we'll want to be able to parse an indefinite number of such derivatives: do you want to do that on this ticket or another?

I agree with Frederic on this: if there is an existing method for extending the Pynac dictionary, then we should use that instead of introducing an additional dictionary. This method should probably be added to the documentation in `calculus.py`.

FYI your documentation doesn't build right now because of unbalanced double backticks. Also, single backticks are what we use for inline LaTeX rendering in ReST, not dollar signs.

In the file:
`local/share/giac/doc/aide_cas`
lines starting by # 
are keywords followed by synonyms, next lines are for small doc and see also.
for full doc it is there:

great, thanks for the detailed answer! 

i wasn't aware about `register_symbol`, yes we should use it.

on the other hand, i tried to see how `locals` dictionary is used in other interfaces. i have the impression that it may be handy in some use cases, in the interactive mode. this example is from `mathematica.py`:

compare 

```
sage: ex = giac('myFun(x)')
sage: ex._sage_({'myFun': sin})
sin(x)
```

to 

```
sage: ex = giac('myFun(x)')
sage: sage.libs.pynac.pynac.register_symbol(sin, {'giac':'myFun'})
sage: ex._sage_()
sin(x)
```

the long import list is.. complicated.

OK. Please see the new ticket #22706. I also created a new subsection at [symbolics wiki](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics) to group these tickets. 

Good finding about the missing support for derivatives of dirac delta! In my opinion it is ok to solve it in a separate ticket, since originally we begun to discuss about transforming proper functions (in the jargon of control theory, meaning that deg numerator <= deg denominator).

IF you like this locals then it is OK for me, but a comment in giac.py code to remind and recommend how to use the table would be nice.

by the way why not just:
`result = giac.laplace(ex, s, t)`
(it looks that the conversion is also done)

Doctests all pass and documentation builds.

Single backticks typeset math so they render regular words in italic. All of the code terms in `giac.py` should be inside double backticks. Similarly, in `calculus.py` the word "cond" should be inside double backticks and one instance of "F" needs single backticks.

The documentation added to `giac.py` doesn't appear in the built documents because `_sage_` is a private method. Is this a deliberate choice? How does one access the documentation for this method?

As far as I know there is no way to display such docstrings (I have struggled myself with this in the past). If something important is there it should be moved to the global documentation at the top of the file.

thanks for the feedback. for the proper string/latex formatting that's good to fix. the problem i have with ReST is that it is absurdly picky when whitespace messes up the proper format; i think it's too much for 2017 but that's way the way it is i guess..

anyway, in the new commits, both remarks have been addressed, taking into account the suggestion by rws, and improve a bit the tutorial.

sorry for the noise but is there a ticket for this already? just discovered that the algorithm description of [solve_linear_de](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/power_series/sage/rings/power_series_ring_element.html#sage.rings.power_series_ring_element.PowerSeries.solve_linear_de) is great, but it is hidden (!)
