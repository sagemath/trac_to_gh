<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

My guess as to why this reversion is needed is because `.__dict__` is a special Python method, which (IIRC) Cython does special processing for. So it, in effect, behaves like a Python object rather than a Cython object.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

They break because the type isn't `dict` but `dictproxy`. For example:

```
sage: type(Integer.__dict__)
<type 'dictproxy'>
sage: isinstance(Integer.__dict__, dict)
False
```

The special Cython handling for `iteritems()` only works for actual dicts.
