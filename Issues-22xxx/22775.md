The package conway_polynomials does not compile with SAGE_PYTHON3=yes.

Let us use pickle instead of sage own save-and-load.

conway_polynomials depends on sagelib, so the latter has be become inport-able into python3 first.

Arguably this is a bad state of affairs, conway_polynomials should just use some Sage-independent format to serialize itself (e.g. plain Python pickles / sqlite / ...).

So it seems that there is some problem with the cython extensions..
