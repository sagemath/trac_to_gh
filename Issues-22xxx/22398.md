Creating mutlivariate Laurent polynomials from other mutlivariate Laurent polynomials sometimes fails.

```
sage: LQ = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5')
sage: LZ = LaurentPolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5')
sage: LQ.inject_variables()
Defining x0, x1, x2, y0, y1, y2, y3, y4, y5
sage: x2^-1*y0*y1*y2*y3*y4*y5 + x1^-1*x2^-1*y0*y1*y3*y4 + x0^-1 in LZ
True
sage: x2^-1*y0*y1*y2*y3*y4*y5 + x1^-1*x2^-1*y0*y1*y3*y4 + x0^-1*x1^-1*y0*y3 + x0^-1 in LZ
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'esub'
```

Apparently this is due to the fact that `LaurentPolynomial_mpair.__init__` changes the keys of the input dictionary.

It would be good to add an explicit doctest showing that the input is not modified. Something like

```
sage: LQ.<x,y> = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: D = {(-1, 1): 1}
sage: type(D.keys()[0])
<type 'tuple'>
sage: LQ(D)
x^-1*y
sage: type(D.keys()[0])
<type 'tuple'>
