```
sage: E = EllipticCurve("141d1")
sage: E.integral_points()
```

goes boom with
` --> 198         raise RuntimeError('Bad arguments to ratpoints')`

Thanks for spotting this.  Since this was implemented I have checed many thousands of curves to compare with Magma, so this must be something new.  In particular ratpoints has changed.

There's another ticket which has been around for ages in which I am fixing other integral points bugs.  What joy.
