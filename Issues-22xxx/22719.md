I am not sure this has not been noted before in some form, but I could not find anything about it.
It is the optimal curve of lowest conductor for which this appears.

Thanks for spotting this.  Since this was implemented I have checed many thousands of curves to compare with Magma, so this must be something new.  In particular ratpoints has changed.

There's another ticket which has been around for ages in which I am fixing other integral points bugs.  What joy.
