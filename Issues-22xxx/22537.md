well, my patchbot shortlog contains (among many other bad-looking things)

```
Attaching gdb to process id 45443.

Saved trace to /home/u1/chapoton/.sage/crash_logs/crash_TkiqJY.log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

It seems that your patchbot is the only one, so then this ticket probably is not the cause.
