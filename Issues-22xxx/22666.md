Since #22354, Python 3 is now installed unconditionally as a standard package.  That's fine, but the last Python 3 version known to work on Cygwin is Python 3.4 (though I have been working with Python upstream to fix that).

In the meantime, here is a patch set needed to get the Python 3 currently in Sage (3.5.1) to at least build, and nominally work.

What's the upstream status of these patches? I always like when patches have some kind of pointer to an upstream ticket or commit or whatever...

For this reason, I consider the renaming `ncurses-issue_14438.patch` -> `2.6.5-ncurses-abi6.patch` a regression.
