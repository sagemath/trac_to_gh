Normaliz has several computation options. They should be exposed by the `Polyhedron_normaliz` constructor.

4.3. Algorithmic variants

 The default choice is the Normaliz primal algorithm that is based on a (partial) triangulation.

 `DualMode`, -d activates the dual algorithm for the computation of the Hilbert basis and degree
 1 elements. Includes HilbertBasis, unless Deg1Elements is set. It overrules
 IsIntegrallyClosed.

 `Approximate`, -r activates the approximation algorithm for the computation of degree 1 elements.
 Nevertheless it does not imply Deg1Elements (we donâ€™t want to block potential
 other applications of Approximate.)

 `BottomDecomposition`, -b tells Normaliz to use bottom decomposition in the primal algorithm.

 `KeepOrder`, -k forbids Normaliz to reorder the generators of the efficient cone C. Only
 useful if original monoid generators are defined. Blocks BottomDecomposition.

(from [Normaliz manual](https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Normaliz3.1.1Documentation.pdf) section 4.3.)
