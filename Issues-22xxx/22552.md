If the input consists of decimal numbers and the `base_ring` is not specified,
the base ring is set to be the `RealField` with the precision given by the
minimal precision of the input. If it has 53 bits of precision, the constructor
converts automatically the base ring to `RDF`::

No, not really...

But at least describing the current behavior may be useful to understand how the constructor works. Is that reasonable?

Once this behavior is changed, I'd just delete the paragraph.

When documented, a bug becomes a feature! What about

```
.. WARNING::

    When used with input in the realf field with 53 bits of mantissa precision
    the input is converted without notice into the machine floating point numbers.
    This behavior might cause some undesirable effects.

I know not everyone is a fan of issuing a warning, but IMHO, I would find it a useful hint to the user if:

- it gave entries with more than 53 bits of mentissa
- it also gave entries with exactly 53 bits of mentissa (not in `ZZ` or `QQ`)

To say:

Warning: some entries had more precision than 53 bits and got converted to 53 bits of precision.

This would not be issued if no entries had more precision than 53 bits.

This sentence is definitely too complicated

```
If the input consists of decimal numbers and the `base_ring`
is not specified, the base ring is set to be the `RealField`
with the precision given by the minimal bit precision of the
input and 53 (the precision of `RDF`). Then, if the obtained
minimum was 53 bits of precision, the constructor converts
automatically the base ring to `RDF`. Otherwise, it returns an error
```
I would try to be more informative

```
Be careful when you construct polyhedra with floating point
numbers. The only available backend for such computation is
`cdd` which uses machine floating point numbers which have
have limited precision (24 bits on 32 bits architecture and
53 bits on 64 bits architecture). Sage behavior 
... etc ... 
```

BTW, what is happening on 32 bits?

It seems that binary64 format from

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754

has 53 bits of precision no matter if it was compiled in 32 or 64 bits processors. I'm no expert here but it seems to be safe to say that a `Double` has 53 bits in 32 and 64 bits.
