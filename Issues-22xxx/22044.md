Why introduce an extra decoding/encoding step? The native format for filenames is `bytes` since that is what the system calls accept. If Python has to convert the filename to `bytes` anyway, why not just feed it `bytes`?

FWIW an easy enough workaround is to pass `universal_newlines=True` to the `subprocess.Popen`.  On Python 2 this doesn't make an enormous difference, especially in Sage since it's not likely going to be calling any programs that output CRLFs.  But on Python 3 it does make a difference since it wraps the streams in `TextIOWrapper`s, which decode bytes to text, by default using `locale.getpreferredencoding()` which is generally appropriate.

> Either treat filenames as byte strings everywhere, or nowhere (but I suggest nowhere because it is user- and developer-hostile to have to look at `bytes` objects containing non-ASCII character data :)  In fact it's more common to deal with filenames as `str` objects in Python for exactly this reason, except for right at the system boundary, or when dealing directly with binary data.

I don't get what the problem is with treating filenames as `bytes` everywhere. It seems to me that things are least error-prone if you avoid conversions `bytes` <-> `str`.

When you use `bytes`, you don't need a workaround at all.

That's where you're wrong.  The further away bytes get from their original source, the harder it is to know where they came from or how they should be interpreted.

Easy: as a `char *` in C. I don't see how one could get this wrong. With `str` of course, it is possible to get the encoding wrong.

This is not the case here.

That's a general discussion about using unicode in Python. I am specifically talking about filenames

> and even in the rather recent PEP 529: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0529/

I see. If I understand things correctly, using `bytes` for filenames is currently problematic in Windows, but that would be fixed by that PEP. So it's still not a problem in the end.

I just read this and I agree almost with everything he says... Python 3 insists too much on unicode.

One particular pet peeve of mine not mentioned in that essay is `os.environ`. At the system level, that's just `char *` but Python 3 insists on interpreting these byte strings as unicode somehow.

You can agree with Armin, and you wouldn't be altogether wrong.  But where you are wrong is trying to defy the design and intent of Python 3.  Armin brought up these issues in part to influence how Python 3 moved forward in treating these issue more sanely to people like him who frequently work on boundary code.  However, nowhere does he argue that Python 3 should just be used incorrectly if you don't have to.

It's not "somehow"--it's using the `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` with surrogateescape handling, which most of the time is right.  `os.environb` was introduced to read the environment directly as bytes.

The "most of the time" is going to bite you someday. `bytes` are never wrong.

This doesn't make any sense.   In Python filenames are neither "bytes" or "str".

In Python, although there are wrappers around POSIX interfaces, you're writing Python not POSIX, and there text is treated as text (especially in Python 3) and in most cases filenames too are text.  In order wedge the POSIX notion of "filenames are `char` arrays" the surrogateescape decoder allows round-tripping arbitrary bytes that can't be decoded to unicode codepoints.
