I just went through the diff which seems to do just what it claims. IIRC, that's an important upgrade bringing the new Jupyter widgets which will enable backward compatibility with the interacts of the legacy Sage notebook. So I am all for getting this in as soon as possible. Thanks Jeroen.

I haven't triple checked the technical details yet though, nor actually tested the branch, and am not sure to have the time before a couple days. So if anyone is up for it, that would be great.
