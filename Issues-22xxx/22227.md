Follow-up on #21539, which introduced this feature. Now we document it.

I'm making this dependent on #22178, which updated related documentation.

OK. In general: yes. In this specific case: no.

But I would certainly consider it "best practice" to use it as make variable, not environment variable.

As I said, in my opinion there's really no need for this distinction.
By the way, this syntax is the syntax for setting a Makefile variable;
however, the variable is USED both as a Makefile variable (in `build/make/Makefile`, generated from `build/make/deps`) and as an environment variable (in `build/bin/sage-logger`).
