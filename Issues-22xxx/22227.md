As I said, in my opinion there's really no need for this distinction.
By the way, this syntax is the syntax for setting a Makefile variable;
however, the variable is USED both as a Makefile variable (in `build/make/Makefile`, generated from `build/make/deps`) and as an environment variable (in `build/bin/sage-logger`).
