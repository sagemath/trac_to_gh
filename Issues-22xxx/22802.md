If you need upstream changes, you will have to add the corresponding patch to our version of sympy. For better granularity, it might be better to do the patching on a separate ticket.

Hello,
I don't know if the procedure is correct:
in $SYMPY 

```
git diff -p 6929ca35a33ba7813cd6d5828d96bc339ea06cb6 > 02_undeffun_sage.patch
```
then 

```
mv 02_undeffun_sage.patch $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/patches/
cat 1.0.p2 > $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/package-version.txt
```

The test are ok. 
I had to modify again sympy : now if the function is known in sympy (like fresneln in calculus.py tests) but not in sage, then the `AttributeError` is raised from sympy and catched in sage as before.

while this is "on-hold", could `derivative` be revised? the docstring has some defects right now:

the branches do have different code for `composition` (since commit ​5a53e12 came after the merge). 

anyway, sorry for my confusion. i didn't realize that it will just overwrite the code in the dependency, but without merge conflict,

```
$ git checkout t/22802/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function
Switched to branch 't/22802/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'trac/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function'.
$ git merge t/23496/public/23496_patch_sympy_abstract_function
Already up-to-date.
