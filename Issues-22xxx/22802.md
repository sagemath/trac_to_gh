Add the page will be a great thing but I don't know if it is necessary for the moment.

Concerning the conflicts with #20204 : I did not see this ticket before, but yes, some problems could arrive.

If you need upstream changes, you will have to add the corresponding patch to our version of sympy. For better granularity, it might be better to do the patching on a separate ticket.

Hello,
I don't know if the procedure is correct:
in $SYMPY 

```
git diff -p 6929ca35a33ba7813cd6d5828d96bc339ea06cb6 > 02_undeffun_sage.patch
```
then 

```
mv 02_undeffun_sage.patch $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/patches/
cat 1.0.p2 > $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/package-version.txt
```

The test are ok. 
I had to modify again sympy : now if the function is known in sympy (like fresneln in calculus.py tests) but not in sage, then the `AttributeError` is raised from sympy and catched in sage as before.

the branches do have different code for `composition` (since commit ​5a53e12 came after the merge). 

anyway, sorry for my confusion. i didn't realize that it will just overwrite the code in the dependency, but without merge conflict,

```
$ git checkout t/22802/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function
Switched to branch 't/22802/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'trac/public/22802_sympy_abstract_function'.
$ git merge t/23496/public/23496_patch_sympy_abstract_function
Already up-to-date.
