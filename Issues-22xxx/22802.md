The PR on sympy si passed , I added tests and resolved some problems.
Add the page will be a great thing but I don't know if it is necessary for the moment.

Concerning the conflicts with #20204 : I did not see this ticket before, but yes, some problems could arrive.

Hello,
I don't know if the procedure is correct:
in $SYMPY 

```
git diff -p 6929ca35a33ba7813cd6d5828d96bc339ea06cb6 > 02_undeffun_sage.patch
```
then 

```
mv 02_undeffun_sage.patch $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/patches/
cat 1.0.p2 > $SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sympy/package-version.txt
```

The test are ok. 
I had to modify again sympy : now if the function is known in sympy (like fresneln in calculus.py tests) but not in sage, then the `AttributeError` is raised from sympy and catched in sage as before.

while this is "on-hold", could `derivative` be revised? the docstring has some defects right now:

- extra spaces that are not conventional in sage library code
- what is `convertion ::` ?

and why should the debug lines `# print(...)` be kept?

the branches do have different code for `composition` (since commit ​5a53e12 came after the merge). 

anyway, sorry for my confusion. i didn't realize that it will just overwrite the code in the dependency, but without merge conflict,

```
