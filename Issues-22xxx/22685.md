Thank you very much for this work. It enhances significantly the 3D plot doc! 
I have two minor suggestions, that you might consider: 
- in the sentence *The viewer is invoked by adding the keyword argument viewer='jmol' (respectively 'tachyon' or 'threejs') to the command show() on any three-dimensional graphic*, one should rather write *(respectively 'threejs' or 'tachyon')* to match the order of the previous sentence.
