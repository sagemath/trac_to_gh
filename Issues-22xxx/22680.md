We now have several programs (e.g. Gap, Maxima)
which have both pexpect and some sort of library-ish
interface.  As a user said,

So we should be sure to have documentation that points
people to that in these cases.  

Separately (though perhaps still on this ticket, if you
disagree open a new one and link to this one) we may wish
to convert some older documentation, particularly in tutorials,
to use library interfaces.  For instance, which interface
do http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/interfaces.html#maxima or http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/interfaces.html#gap use?
