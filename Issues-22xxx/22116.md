The symptom is the error at the line `cd leon make` coming from a `Makefile` in `guava` package.

```
make[3]: Entering directory '/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/gap/gap-4.8.3/pkg/guava-3.13/src'
gcc  -O2 -L/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib  -o leonconv leonconv.c
cd leon make
/bin/sh: line 0: cd: too many arguments
make[3]: *** [Makefile:14: all] Error 1
```

This happens when `/bin/sh` is bash 4.4.5(1). New bash versions like this one do not silently ignore extra arguments to `cd` (even though it is documented as ignored). So the line `cd leon make` behaves like `cd leon` which is a no-op since no other commands follow that `cd` command.

Guava readme on its [homepage](https://github.com/osj1961/guava) lists Leon's programs as a part, so they should be built, in fact.

See also the corresponding gentoo [github thread](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/issues/447).

The build system is a right mess. 

```
SRCDIR  = ./src/leon
CJSRCDIR= ./src/ctjhai
BINDIR = bin/$(GAPARCH)
#GAP_PATH=../..
#PKG_PATH=.
#SRCDISTFILE=guava

targets: default

default: bindir minimum-weight leonconv desauto install

# this target creates a bin-directory
bindir:
	if test ! -d $(BINDIR);  then mkdir -p $(BINDIR);  fi

minimum-weight: $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf2.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf3.o $(CJSRCDIR)/popcount.o
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight \
$(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight.o $(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf2.o \
$(CJSRCDIR)/minimum-weight-gf3.o $(CJSRCDIR)/popcount.o -lm

leonconv: 
	cd ./src; $(MAKE) CC="$(CC)" CPPFLAGS="$(CPPFLAGS)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)";

desauto: 
	cd $(SRCDIR); autoreconf --install --force || true ; ./configure; $(MAKE) CC="$(CC)" CPPFLAGS="$(CPPFLAGS)" CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS)" LDFLAGS="$(LDFLAGS)";
```
so the `desauto` target will produce a makefile in `src/leon` and run make. In effect that little bit in `src/Makefile` would be "useful" if the `desauto` target was run before `leonconv`. As it is, it indeed does nothing.

I'm on bash 4.4.5(1) (according to manpages of bash, the args of cd after dir are ignored). If I merely use the branch I still cannot build, I need to run configure in src/leon first. I need to check that this can be replaced by adding
the explicit dependency (but I guess it will do).

I'm experimenting with stock GAP 4.8.6 now, same issues.
