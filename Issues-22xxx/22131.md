While `randint` still returns Python `int`s, presumably intentionally, one can't get random elements of `Integer` without using `ZZ.random_element`.  See [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings_standard/sage/rings/integer_ring.html#sage.rings.integer_ring.IntegerRing_class.random_element).  It would be nice to do this more easily.

For instance, by analogy with `random_prime` one could do `random_integer` as a top-level thing.  At the very least we should improve documentation.
