<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
Shell is fun, so some more:

```
egrep ' an [aeiouy][a-z]{3,}' -R src/sage -o --no-filename | sort -u | colrm 1 4 > /tmp/an
egrep ' a [aeiouy][a-z]{3,}' -R src/sage -o --no-filename | sort -u | colrm 1 3 > /tmp/a
fgrep -x --file=/tmp/a /tmp/an
```

Some way to extract parts from docstrings and feed them to spell checker would be nice.
