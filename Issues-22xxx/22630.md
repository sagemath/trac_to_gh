The current `LCM_list` will mutate the list when it contains `int`'s (and possibly Sage integers and `long`):

```
sage: L = [int(1), int(2)]
sage: lcm(L)
2
sage: type(L[0])
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

Old timings:

```
sage: %timeit [LCM_list(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.43 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2,3,4,5]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 56.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1,2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([2]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.5 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([1]) for _ in range(100)]
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.6 µs per loop
sage: %timeit [LCM_list([]) for _ in range(100)]
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.25 µs per loop
sage: L.append(polygen(ZZ, 'x'))
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.87 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [lcm(L) for _ in range(100)]
1 loop, best of 3: 395 ms per loop

sage: L.insert(0, polygen(ZZ, 'x'))

1 loop, best of 3: 394 ms per loop
```
So this does have a constant time slowdown when looping over (Sage) integer lists of about 6/100 µs or 60 ns per call. I think this is acceptable in comparison to how much we gain for a mixed list, fixing the bug at hand, and consolidating things into a single function.
