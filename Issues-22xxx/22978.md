The file `symbolic/expression.pyx` with >12k lines and >200 member functions is overweight. Editing, even with a folding editor, is no longer practical. Moreover the documentation gets converted into a single file that has no structure and exploring things by browsing leads nowhere.

The ticket should split the file into meaningful subsections and give a short overview (link list) of member functions on top of each sub-file.

Component: **documentation**
