If `errno.EEXIST` can not happen, then it would better be deleted and handled by the `else`.

I don't like the default

```
    else:
        # Something that we did not expect happened.
        # Let's hope for the best, and let symlink fail with an error
        # that is easier to debug.
        pass
```
Shouldn't a `raise RuntimeError` be more appropriate?

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A13):

I guess it's there for a reason. I do not want to break the installation on some obscure platform.

Why? If symlink works, then we don't care. If it fails, then it is going to produce a good error message on its own.
