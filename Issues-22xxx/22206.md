- the main function still has no documentation

- when calling a reference, you must write `[CGMRV16]_` with an underscore

Dear Kolja and Petru,

a few comments on your code:
- ticket #22247 should allow you to avoid a (costly) call to `self.edge_connectivity()`
- `Dg = DiGraph([self.vertices(), self.edges()])` could be simply `Dg = DiGraph(self)`
- when you do `treeEdges = [(edge[0],edge[1]) for edge in self.edges() if edge in te]`, all edges in `te` are in `self`. So to remove the labels, you can do `treeEdges = [(u,v) for u,v,_ in te]`
- You can initialize `existingAedges` directly using `existingAedges = [0]*len(A)`
- avoid `bitChanged >>= 1; bit += 1;` and put each instruction in a separate line
- use `yield Dg.copy()`. Indeed, the instruction `yield Dg` will in fact return a pointer. Since `Dg` is modified in your method, what you have returned will also be modified. 

Best,

David.

Hi David,

 Thanks for the comments. Cannot use `Dg = DiGraph(self)` because it will doubly orient all the edges of self, and we want Dg to be a simple directed graph.
For ticket #22247 can I already use the code even if it was not validated yet in sage ?

Petru

Right, I forgot that issue ;)

I'm not a git guru, but I think you can safely rebase your ticket on top of #22247 (or #22254). Don't forget to indicate the dependency.

I discovered some limitations that must be fixed and may be documented (at least to recall that the number of orientations could be huge).

1- I don't know what's going on here. I tried many times and sometimes its working well, sometimes not. I have put the graph6 strings of the graphs so that you can try it and track&solve the issue.

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(30, 2)
sage: G.graph6_string()
']ZgZCOWg@OD?c?G@?oA?C_?D??SO?@?A??_AC??OO?A???o?G?OG@??A?A??P???A_???CC???'
sage: %time D = next(G.strong_orientations_iterator())
CPU times: user 1.39 s, sys: 663 ms, total: 2.06 s
Wall time: 2.37 s
sage:
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(30, 2)
sage: G.graph6_string()
']\\cl@_W_`_S?GA?KOC?c?GO?P?@C???`AA??C?G?_@??A?OC_??_???aO???C??@_??A???o??'
sage: %time D = next(G.strong_orientations_iterator())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
StopIteration                             Traceback (most recent call last)
...
StopIteration: 
```

2- Here we have too big numbers, but it can be easily fixed replacing the `for i in range(0, 2**(len(A)-1))` loop with a while loop. 

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(100, 2)
sage: %time D = next(G.strong_orientations_iterator())
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverflowError                             Traceback (most recent call last)
...
/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/strong_orientations_generator.pyc in strong_orientations_iterator(self)
    131     # of G by orienting properly the tree-edges
    132     previousWord = 0
--> 133     for i in range(0, 2**(len(A)-1)):
    134         word = (i >> 1) ^ i
    135         bitChanged = word ^ previousWord

OverflowError: range() result has too many items
sage: G.graph6_string()
'b\\MOp_WGS_D?g?a?B?C?O?Q?H??OO?_?CGC?c??@A??A?@??OG?G_????G?G???P?OO??_@???A??@@O?????@?_??C@???P?????'
```

3- Concerning the `_all_strong_orientations_of_a_mixed_graph` method (you should remove the `all`), I don't know how many number of recursive calls can be done before reaching the stack limit. So we might have a problem here too. This will certainly appear after you have fixed the previous issues.

I changed the for loop into a while loop, as well as the name of the helper method (will submit it). The second and the third graphs in your tests are not biconnected, so there is no strong orientation possible for these graphs. That's why the next() method of the iterator throws an exception (which is the normal behaviour).

Right, first time I realize that the BA generator could return graphs that are not  biconnected.

So far no stackoverflow error, but slow on large graphs. This was expected.

```

```

The patch passes all tests on `src/sage/graphs/` but I have an issue with the documentation. I tried `make doc-clean && make` and got

Are you able to build the doc ? may be the problem comes from something else...

I get the same errors as you and as far as I see from the error message, the problem comes from the docstring of the `topological_minor`. Since it's my first submission, just to be clear: besides the file containing the function, the only changes I made in the rest of sage hierarchy was adding in sage/src/sage/graphs/graph.py an additional category and these lines of code :

```
from sage.graphs.strong_orientations_generator import strong_orientations_iterator
Graph.strong_orientations_iterator    =    strong_orientations_iterator
```

Did I forget something?

Right, you should add `sage/graphs/strong_orientations_generator` to file `src/doc/en/reference/graphs/index.rst`. This way the file will be well visible in html documentation.

I have no clue where the error with `topological_minor` comes from. May be some cache has to be clear or... don't know. May be the patchbot will provide extra information after adding above line and setting the ticket to needs review.

Now everything is working well: passes all tests and the documentation builds properly and look nice.

I have only very minor comments
* at the beginning of the module, you have `O(m*n)` but O(m) is without <code>\`</code>
* You can check the source code of `src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/vertex_separation.pyx` to see how to get some titles in bold, or some titles with a blue background. This is not very important.

After that we will be done.

Some comments.

- `strong_orientations_iterator` should not have `self` as an input. Moreover, `self` is not listed as an input.
- You should have `strong_orientations_iterator` in the actual `graph.py` as a proper method. This makes code maintenance easier.
- References should go in the master reference file.
- I suspect your name is not `YOUR NAME`.
- You should use `.. NOTE::` blocks.
- You missed a latex formatting around an `O(m)` in the `ALGORITHM` part of `strong_orientations_generator.py`. Similarly, you should remove the `*` from the earlier one.
- The `INPUT` block should be formatted as:

  ```
    INPUT:

    - ``D``g -- the mixed graph; the undirected edges are doubly oriented
    - ``V`` -- the set of vertices
    - ``E`` -- the set of undirected edges (these edges are oriented in both ways);
      no labels are allowed
  ```
- All of your conditionals have an extra space, i.e., change `if cond :` to `if cond:`.
- This change needs to be reverted:

The reason I followed the same way of coding by doing the import of the main function (i.e. `strong_orientations_iterator`) in `graph.py` is because I thought that importing the entire function makes somehow the entire code of the class `Graph` easier as this class is already quite big in terms of lines of code.

I'm in favor of having a special file for all kinds of orientations.

So, unless someone has strong arguments against it, I suggest to rename the file `orientations.py`, rewrite the file header to explain that this file contains methods related to graph orientations and move the description of the strong orientation generator inside the method.

The top description of the file could be something like:

```
r"""
Orientations

This module implements several methods to compute orientations of undirected
graphs subject to specific constraints (e.g., acyclic, strongly connected,
etc.). It also implements some iterators over all these orientations.

**This module contains the following methods**

.. csv-table::
    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    :meth:`strong_orientations_iterator` | Return an iterator over all strong orientations of a graph `G`


Authors
-------

- Kolja Knauer, Petru Valicov (2017-01-10) -- initial version


Methods
-------
"""
```
See file `src/sage/graphs/graph_decomposition/vertex_separation.pyx` for example.



In another ticket, we can move related methods to this new file, and at the same time fix minor issues such as:

```
sage: G = Graph(1)
sage: next(G.orientations())
Digraph on 0 vertices
```

* you forgot to update file `src/doc/en/reference/graphs/index.rst`: `sage/graphs/strong_orientations_generator` -> `sage/graphs/orientations`. After that I can try to build the doc.

* Because we use this definition "A biconnected graph is a connected graph on two or more vertices that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex.", we have the following issue:

```
