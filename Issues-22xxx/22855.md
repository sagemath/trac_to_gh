<a id='comment:4'></a>Can we lift this to the category and use more generic code (i.e., by using the `canonical_matrix`)?

I'm also a little worried about using the fundamental weights for a few reasons. The first is the choice of a weight lattice I think means we have chosen a Cartan type, which is a little bit of extra data. The second is that the simple roots are not necessarily linearly independent when described by the fundamental weights, e.g., in affine types you need an extra element `\delta`.

Actually, the `ReflectionGroup_real.permutahedron` says in a `.. NOTE::` that it is in the root system basis. Christian, do you have any comments on this?

Minor doc point, you need an extra blank line:

The `canonical_matrix` is suppose to be with respect to the root basis (i.e., the canonical faithful representation), so there is nothing you need to test.

Actually, the bilinear form (can be obtained from the Coxeter matrix, which is basically a required method) and fundamental weights (which comes from the bilinear form) both should be lifted to the category.

> For the fundamental_weights, it actually looks at the bilinear form which is only looking at the coxeter matrix. So in the case of CoxeterMatrixGroups there is not that extra bit of data.


Ah, right, it is just the dual basis wrt the bilinear form. Which roots are short and long are not relevant.

> For your second concern, for affine Coxeter groups, fundamental_weights already breaks on affine Coxeter groups due to the concern you described above.

Yes, we should definitely check that the group is finite, otherwise the permutahedron would run for forever. For example, I believe this would never terminate:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup([[1,7,2],[7,1,3],[2,3,1]])
sage: W.bilinear_form().det()
-1/2*E(7) - 1/4*E(7)^2 - 1/4*E(7)^3 - 1/4*E(7)^4 - 1/4*E(7)^5 - 1/2*E(7)^6
sage: W.permutahedron()
# Wait until the end of the universe
```
