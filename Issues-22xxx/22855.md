The `canonical_matrix` is suppose to be with respect to the root basis (i.e., the canonical faithful representation), so there is nothing you need to test.

Actually, the bilinear form (can be obtained from the Coxeter matrix, which is basically a required method) and fundamental weights (which comes from the bilinear form) both should be lifted to the category.

> For the fundamental_weights, it actually looks at the bilinear form which is only looking at the coxeter matrix. So in the case of CoxeterMatrixGroups there is not that extra bit of data.


Ah, right, it is just the dual basis wrt the bilinear form. Which roots are short and long are not relevant.

> For your second concern, for affine Coxeter groups, fundamental_weights already breaks on affine Coxeter groups due to the concern you described above. So in this case the permutahedron would throw the same error as fundamental weights will. To alter the error we can always check to make sure the group is finite and throw an error if not and go from there.


Yes, we should definitely check that the group is finite, otherwise the permutahedron would run for forever. For example, I believe this would never terminate:

```
sage: W = CoxeterGroup([[1,7,2],[7,1,3],[2,3,1]])
sage: W.bilinear_form().det()
-1/2*E(7) - 1/4*E(7)^2 - 1/4*E(7)^3 - 1/4*E(7)^4 - 1/4*E(7)^5 - 1/2*E(7)^6
sage: W.permutahedron()
# Wait until the end of the universe
```
