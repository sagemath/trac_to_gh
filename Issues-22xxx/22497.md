We provide a file `sage/interfaces/latte.py` that provides a uniform function `count` to query the LattE program `count` (`integrate` will be dealt with in another ticket). It is used in this ticket to refactor `ehrhart_polynomial` and `integral_points_count`.

Prerequisite for #18232.

```
sage -t --long /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/latte.py
