Expected:

```
sage: x.is_integer()
Unknown
sage: if x.is_real(): True
sage: if not x.is_real(): False
False
```

To clarify, I think it's possible to separate the issue of
"why do I get False" from the issue of deciding between
`True/False/Unknown`, by simply returning Unknown if the
Pynac logic returns false.

It would be much less surprising to the user.

Later, when the complementary flags (irreal, noninteger, nonpositive) are implemented in Pynac these function can return `True/Unknown/False`, e.g. `is_integer` will return False if `is_noninteger` returns True, so both behave complementary.
