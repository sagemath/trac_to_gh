Expected:

```
sage: x.is_integer()
Unknown
sage: if x.is_real(): True
sage: if not x.is_real(): False
False
```

To clarify, I think it's possible to separate the issue of
"why do I get False" from the issue of deciding between
`True/False/Unknown`, by simply returning Unknown if the
Pynac logic returns false.

It would be much less surprising to the user.

Later, when the complementary flags (irreal, noninteger, nonpositive) are implemented in Pynac these function can return `True/Unknown/False`, e.g. `is_integer` will return False if `is_noninteger` returns True, so both behave complementary.

Well, quoting `unknown.py`, `..warning:: Unless PEP 335 is accepted, in the following cases, and, not and or return a somewhat wrong value::`. PEP 335 was rejected so I'm being pragmatic and accept the (admittedly) small value of serving the users that don't write Sage code.

Also, isn't that an independent issue?

Disclaimer: Python is not my specialty.

Either you convert `Unknown` to `bool` (and you provide the means to do it via `__nonzero__`) or you don't (and deny any attempt). The former is this branch at the moment, the latter would force users to explicitly compare with `True/False/Unknown`, disallowing `if is_xyz():` conditionals. It would also disallow `not is_xyz()` and `is_xy() and/or is_yz()`. By disallow I mean an exception is raised. The patch to achieve this would simply be:

```

`Unknown` is used in a few places. With the patch I get about 100 doctest fails in `combinat`. I have not looked further into this.
