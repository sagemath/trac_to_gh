As the last example shows, some mathematical expressions return ‘exact’ values, rather than numerical approximations. To get a numerical approximation, use either the function n or the method n (and both of these have a longer name, numerical_approx, and the function N is the same as n)). 

Here the 'function n' should be replaced by function N.
