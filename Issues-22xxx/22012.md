It turns out that the changes made here do turn the comparison of elements of vecctors over the symbolic ring into "symbolic inequalities". Probably this should be the expected behaviour.

For me, SR is a rather awful and undefined thing, in which **equality and comparison do not make sense**. Maybe we will hit later a large scale problem when handling python3 conversion of cmp in SR, or maybe not.
