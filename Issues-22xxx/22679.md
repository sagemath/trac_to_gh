Please see #26249 for the followup (for FreeBSD 12).

FreeBSD as of version 10 uses clang by default, and is closer to OSX in other ways too, so it would be a good free testing ground for the use of clang with Sage. 


## preparing tools:

* install gcc6 and create fake gfortran by making a link to gfortran6
* make sure `as` is new enough: `pkg install binutils` will install `as` version 2.28, and you need it to come first in `PATH` (i.e. make sure that `/usr/local/bin` comes before `/usr/bin`).
* remove stale `/lib/libgcc_s.so.1` and point it to the right one in `/usr/local/lib/gcc6/` (perhaps there is a better way...)
* install gmake, gawk, gsed, and create fake make and sed to point to gmake and gsed
* make sure `/bin/sh` is actually bash
* install pkgconf (FreeBSD's replacement of pkg-config)
* install wget (needed for `AtlasRep` GAP package).
* install icu (needed for R)

## building Sage itself

starting from a clean git repo:

```
export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,--add-needed -lm"
./configure CC=cc CXX=c++  #(this is clang 3.8.0 a.t.m.)
MAKE="make -j7" make build
MAKE="make -j4" make # building docs is very memory-hungry
``` 



## HISTORICAL: Sage itself:

* hack configure.ac to make freebsd allowed platform
* deal with cephes' complex.h conflicting with numpy - #22786 
* gf2x: only builds with SAGE_FAT_BINARY on
* upgrade sqlite to version 3.17 - otherwise there are compiling problems with editline (see #22687)
* flint: remove "-ascii -pedantic" flags from CFLAGS in configure
* libraries (libgap, cddlib, etc) need -fPIC for CFLAGS (so we build with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe" ; (-pipe is probably not really needed)) - see #22784
* but gap cannot be built with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe", as it does something weird in ./configure, setting BASECC to be cc, and generating broken Makefile (with -fPIC and -pipe on two separate lines); so build gap with CC=cc 
* giac needs `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"` to find `libintl.h` and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lintl"` to link.
* either provide /bin/bash or fix this properly (#22689)
* Sage builds and runs, modulo linking issues with flint and arb, which can be fixed ad hoc by hand.
* deal with cephes' libm not pulling system's libm, unless some arcane linker flags are used (see comments below)
* old freebsd workaround for libgd removed in #22785
* ...

<a id='comment:6'></a>cf my comments at
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8530

for the need for /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 to be replaced.

Basically, gcc/gfortran and clang's toolchains are slightly incompatible; while workarounds are in place for OSX,
linking on freebsd makes it more or less mandatory.

+FreeBSD as of version 10 uses clang by default, and is closer to OSX in other ways too, so it would be a good free testing ground for the use of clang with Sage. 
 
+Few details I figured out.
+
+
+## preparing tools:
+
+* install gcc6 and create fake gfortran by making a link to gfortran6
+* remove stale /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 and point it to the right one in /usr/local/lib/gcc6/
+* install gmake, gawk, gsed, and create fake make and sed to point to gmake and gsed
+* make sure /bin/sh is actually bash
+* install pkgconf (FreeBSD's replacement of pkg-config)
+
+## Sage itself:
+
+* hack configure.ac to make freebsd allowed platform
+* get rid of cephes - it causes linking problems with libm, and is probably not needs any more anyway
+* figure out what to do with Sage's libz and libbz - they cause linking problems (needless to say, system versions are perfectly good) 
+* gf2x: only builds with SAGE_FAT_BINARY on
+* upgrade sqlite to version 3.17 - otherwise there are compiling problems with editline (see #22687)
+* flint: remove "-ascii -pedantic" flags from CFLAGS in configure
+* libraries (libgap, cddlib, etc) need -fPIC for CFLAGS (so we build with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe" ; (-pipe is probably not really needed))
+* but gap cannot be built with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe", as it
+does something weird in ./configure, setting BASECC to be cc,
+and generating broken Makefile (with -fPIC and -pipe on two
+separate lines); so build gap with CC=cc 
+* giac needs `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"` to find `libintl.h` and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lintl"` to link.
+* either provide /bin/bash or fix this properly (#22689)
+* Sage builds and runs, modulo linking issues with flint and arb,
+which can be fixed ad hoc by hand.

I am not sure whether letting cephes create `libm.so` rather than something like `libm_complex.so` is a good idea. At least I do not see how one can in such a configuration link an executable that needs things from the "normal" `libm` as well as from cephes---in particular as Sage has moved away from using things like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to using `-rpath` to link.

        return 0;
}
```
With two different `libm`'s, I don't see a way to create a working executable (with clang). However if I rename
cephes' `libm` to `libm_complex` then (from SAGE_ROOT) the result of 

```
cc -I./local/include t.c -lm -L./local/lib -lm_complex -Wl,-rpath=./local/lib
``` 
works just fine.

I am not entirely sure because I think freeBSD doesn't use sonames. But linking with two shared libraries of the same name is at best awkward. The linker can take `-lm` several times and several paths with `-L`, not a problem. The problem is at runtime. Let's see an elf shared object on linux, say openblas:

```

Dynamic section at offset 0x3e3b60 contains 27 entries:

....
```
The linker effectively create a table of libraries to be loaded at runtime. It also can include runtime path to search first before the normal order from `ld.so.conf`. But you see that if two libraries have strictly the same name the first one to be found will be the only one used.

If you link a library the linker may not complain if it cannot resolve some symbols because it cannot combine the two `libm.so`. Undefined symbols are legal in a library. It is not in an executable. I am not quite sure in that case if the linker can even see the two different set of symbols at the same time. In any case you will still have the problem at run time.

Apart from different name the only way out is to have one of the two being static instead of dynamic and then you pass it to the linker as an object with its full path (not just `-L$path -lm` but `$path/libm.a`).

There is no `/lib/libm.so`, only `/lib/libm.so.5`.

I think the idea at the time of old Sage port to FreeBSD (#9543) was that `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libm.so` serves as a replacement for system's `libm`.
But it seems that even though the former (renamed) is linked to the latter, 

```
$ ldd local/lib/libm_complex.so 
local/lib/libm_complex.so:
        libc.so.7 => /lib/libc.so.7 (0x800823000)
        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5 (0x80120c000)

```
this still leads to
ugly linker errors complaining about absent `exp2`. More specifically, if I remove `-lm` from the invocation above I get

```
$ cc -I./local/include t.c -L./local/lib -lm_complex -Wl,-rpath=./local/lib

/usr/bin/ld: undefined reference to symbol `exp2@@FBSD_1.0' (try adding -lm)
//lib/libm.so.5: could not read symbols: Bad value
```
(the latter is puzzling - it knows where to look for `exp2`, but bails out...)


 
> 
> Apart from different name the only way out is to have one of the two being static instead of dynamic and then you pass it to the linker as an object with its full path (not just `-L$path -lm` but `$path/libm.a`).


this is not really better than creating a separate dynamic library, IMHO.

it's 64-bit, and yes, I can build and run the result of

```
$ cc -I./local/include t.c -L./local/lib -lm_complex -lm -Wl,-rpath=./local/lib
```
just fine.

Certainly, having a new library to add, instead of providing a replacement for libm, is a pain, although a limited to few packages one.

they have there (as well as in #14491) an `ld` wrapper that uses `--copy-dt-needed-entries` option to
recursively search libraries. And indeed the following (with the "classical" GNU buntils ld) gives working `a.out`.

```
$ cc -c -I./local/include t.c
$ /usr/local/bin/ld --eh-frame-hdr -dynamic-linker /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 -L./local/lib --copy-dt-needed-entries -rpath=./local/lib /usr/lib/crt1.o /usr/lib/crti.o t.o -lc -lm_complex /usr/lib/crtn.o
```

But this option has a different name with the default linker, as far as testing and manuals say.

```
/usr/bin/ld: unrecognized option '--copy-dt-needed-entries'
```
The reason is that the default linker used by clang is

```
$ /usr/bin/ld -v
GNU ld 2.17.50 [FreeBSD] 2007-07-03
```

The corresponding option is called `--add-needed`. (It's possible to find this by calling `/usr/bin/ld --help`.) So the right command (giving working `a.out`) to pull system's `libm` with the custom (renamed to `libm_complex`) `libm` is

```
cc -I./local/include -L./local/lib -Wl,--add-needed -Wl,-rpath=./local/lib -lm_complex t.c
```

Have a look at `library_order_list` in `src/module_list.py` to deal with ordering of libraries.

+FreeBSD as of version 10 uses clang by default, and is closer to OSX in other ways too, so it would be a good free testing ground for the use of clang with Sage. 
 
+Few details I figured out.
+
+
+## preparing tools:
+
+* install gcc6 and create fake gfortran by making a link to gfortran6
+* remove stale /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 and point it to the right one in /usr/local/lib/gcc6/
+* install gmake, gawk, gsed, and create fake make and sed to point to gmake and gsed
+* make sure /bin/sh is actually bash
+* install pkgconf (FreeBSD's replacement of pkg-config)
+
+## Sage itself:
+
+* hack configure.ac to make freebsd allowed platform
+* deal with cephes' complex.h comflicting with numpy
+* gf2x: only builds with SAGE_FAT_BINARY on
+* upgrade sqlite to version 3.17 - otherwise there are compiling problems with editline (see #22687)
+* flint: remove "-ascii -pedantic" flags from CFLAGS in configure
+* libraries (libgap, cddlib, etc) need -fPIC for CFLAGS (so we build with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe" ; (-pipe is probably not really needed))
+* but gap cannot be built with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe", as it
+does something weird in ./configure, setting BASECC to be cc,
+and generating broken Makefile (with -fPIC and -pipe on two
+separate lines); so build gap with CC=cc 
+* giac needs `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"` to find `libintl.h` and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lintl"` to link.
+* either provide /bin/bash or fix this properly (#22689)
+* Sage builds and runs, modulo linking issues with flint and arb,
+which can be fixed ad hoc by hand.
+* deal with cephes' libm not pulling system's libm, unless some arcane linker flags are used (see comments below)

OK, I'll rebuild without #22159 and post the outputs of readelf and ldd. Anyway,
with #22159 I get

```
$ ldd local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/coding/binary_code.so
local/lib/python/site-packages/sage/coding/binary_code.so:
        libm.so => /usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/libm.so (0x801256000)
        libgmp.so.22 => /usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/libgmp.so.22 (0x801462000)
        libpython2.7.so.1 => /usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/libpython2.7.so.1 (0x8016e6000)
        libpari-gmp.so.5 => /usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib/libpari-gmp.so.5 (0x801c00000)
        libthr.so.3 => /lib/libthr.so.3 (0x802678000)
        libc.so.7 => /lib/libc.so.7 (0x800823000)
        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5 (0x80289f000)
        libutil.so.9 => /lib/libutil.so.9 (0x802aca000)

readelf:

0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm.so]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libgmp.so.22]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython2.7.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpari-gmp.so.5]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libthr.so.3]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.7]
 0x000000000000000f (RPATH)              Library rpath: [/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib]
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/lib]
```

so there is no sign of `libpng` anywhere; I looked further in Python's dynamically loaded modules in `local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/`, but even there I do not see `libpng`.

What does load it, and how? Is it a sort of dynamic loading (`dlopen`?) that is not recorded by the linker?
Would one have to resort to analysing a dump or running under gdb? Uh-oh...

OK, I've rebuilt with old (Sage's current) libpng:

```

        libutil.so.9 => /lib/libutil.so.9 (0x8030ca000)
```
And got these errors back, too:

```

```
That is, if we are trusting the error message, somewhere wrong headers (and a library, I suppose) were used for compilation, isn't it?

<a id='comment:45'></a>this is how to reproduce it at the Sage prompt, with more details (pickling is the problem):

```
sage: from sage.misc.all import loads, dumps
sage: a=matrix(GF(2),3,range(9),sparse=False); a

[0 1 0]
[1 0 1]
[0 1 0]
sage: dumps(a)
libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.27+apng
...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
digging out what dumps does gives

```
sage: from six.moves import cPickle
sage: # or just import cPickle # makes no difference
sage: a=matrix(GF(2),3,range(9),sparse=False)
sage: cPickle.dumps(a)
libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.27+apng
...
```

digging more gives:

```
sage: a=matrix(GF(2),3,range(9),sparse=False)
sage: from sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense import to_png
sage: to_png(a,"/tmp/blah")
libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.6.27+apng
libpng warning: Application  is  running with png.c from libpng-1.2.51
GD Error: gd-png: fatal libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library
```

`to_png` calls `gdImage*` things from `libgd`, which in turn call `gd_png`; this uses `libpng`.
Now one can see the cause of trouble: 

it's a bug in `libgd` configure, which places `-I/usr/local/include` in front of 
`-I$SAGE_LOCAL/include/...`; more precisely, there is an old FreeBSD-specific
patch in its spkg-install, which causes this thing, 4cf1a0c642a.

Removing it fixes this problem. Duh...

It's easy in this case.
I've installed FreeBSD's package gcc6, which comes, well, with gcc-6.3, and does not install gcc or gfortran. Then I made a symbolic link pointing gfortran to gfortran6.
And building with SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no does the trick.

PS. I'm on vacation for another week, replies might be slow :-)

<a id='comment:64'></a>sympow tests of analytic_rank fail on curves of even rank, and works for odd rank, does not matter whether sympow is built with clang 3.8 or with gcc 6.3.

Using `clang-devel`, which is `clang-4.0.0`, makes the `sympow` tests pass. This is probably due to it using `llvm-as` rather than `as`, with is horribly old (version 2.17, dates back to 2007) on FreeBSD. 

Looks like we're converging to the state we have on OSX w.r.t. clang (#12426).

Alternatively, using `/usr/local/bin/as` (version 2.28) instead, makes `sympow` tests pass, too.

<a id='comment:68'></a>ccache, gfan,lcalc,tachyon need to have their LDFLAGS sorted due to `libm` linking, 
as  our special LDFLAGS must come first in the linking list of parameters.
Worked around for the time being by adding LDFLAGS to CC and CXX, i.e.

```
$ CXX="$CXX $LDFLAGS" CC="$CC $LDFLAGS" make 
```

however, it seems that passing unrecognised options to the compiler has strange side effects on `sympow` - it creates an executable that fails tests it fails if built with old `as` (sic!).

+FreeBSD as of version 10 uses clang by default, and is closer to OSX in other ways too, so it would be a good free testing ground for the use of clang with Sage. 
 
+Few details I figured out.
+
+
+## preparing tools:
+
+* install gcc6 and create fake gfortran by making a link to gfortran6
+* make sure `as` is new enough: `pkg install binutils` will install `as` version 2.28, and you need it to come first in `PATH` (i.e. make sure that `/usr/local/bin` comes before `/usr/bin`).
+* remove stale `/lib/libgcc_s.so.1` and point it to the right one in `/usr/local/lib/gcc6/` (perhaps there is a better way...)
+* install gmake, gawk, gsed, and create fake make and sed to point to gmake and gsed
+* make sure `/bin/sh` is actually bash
+* install pkgconf (FreeBSD's replacement of pkg-config)
+
+## building Sage itself
+
+starting from a clean git repo:
+
+* export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
+* export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"
+* export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,--add-needed -lm"
+* ./configure CC=cc CXX=c++  (this is clang 3.8.0 a.t.m.)

<a id='comment:87'></a>now `MAKE="make -j1 make ptest` has just 3 failures:

of which the 1st is something to look at:

```
File "src/sage/interfaces/tests.py", line 36, in sage.interfaces.tests
Failed example:
    subprocess.call("echo syntax error | gap", **kwds)
Expected:

2nd is just numerical noise, the 3rd is

```

Failed example:

Expected:
    '120\n'
Got:

```

A bigger problem is with `-jX` for `X>1`; it's not really possible to build docs, one gets weird segfaults related to ECL/Maxima. It's very likely that they are of the same nature as the following weirdness (they look very similar): start Sage, type

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import

+Please see #26249 for the followup (for FreeBSD 12).
 
+FreeBSD as of version 10 uses clang by default, and is closer to OSX in other ways too, so it would be a good free testing ground for the use of clang with Sage. 
+
+
+## preparing tools:
+
+* install gcc6 and create fake gfortran by making a link to gfortran6
+* make sure `as` is new enough: `pkg install binutils` will install `as` version 2.28, and you need it to come first in `PATH` (i.e. make sure that `/usr/local/bin` comes before `/usr/bin`).
+* remove stale `/lib/libgcc_s.so.1` and point it to the right one in `/usr/local/lib/gcc6/` (perhaps there is a better way...)
+* install gmake, gawk, gsed, and create fake make and sed to point to gmake and gsed
+* make sure `/bin/sh` is actually bash
+* install pkgconf (FreeBSD's replacement of pkg-config)
+* install wget (needed for `AtlasRep` GAP package).
+* install icu (needed for R)
+
+## building Sage itself
+
+starting from a clean git repo:
+
+```
+export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
+export CXXFLAGS="-fPIC"
+export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,--add-needed -lm"
+./configure CC=cc CXX=c++  #(this is clang 3.8.0 a.t.m.)
+MAKE="make -j7" make build
+MAKE="make -j4" make # building docs is very memory-hungry
+``` 
+
+
+
+## HISTORICAL: Sage itself:
+
+* hack configure.ac to make freebsd allowed platform
+* deal with cephes' complex.h conflicting with numpy - #22786 
+* gf2x: only builds with SAGE_FAT_BINARY on
+* upgrade sqlite to version 3.17 - otherwise there are compiling problems with editline (see #22687)
+* flint: remove "-ascii -pedantic" flags from CFLAGS in configure
+* libraries (libgap, cddlib, etc) need -fPIC for CFLAGS (so we build with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe" ; (-pipe is probably not really needed)) - see #22784
+* but gap cannot be built with CC="cc -fPIC -pipe", as it does something weird in ./configure, setting BASECC to be cc, and generating broken Makefile (with -fPIC and -pipe on two separate lines); so build gap with CC=cc 
+* giac needs `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"` to find `libintl.h` and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lintl"` to link.
+* either provide /bin/bash or fix this properly (#22689)
+* Sage builds and runs, modulo linking issues with flint and arb, which can be fixed ad hoc by hand.
+* deal with cephes' libm not pulling system's libm, unless some arcane linker flags are used (see comments below)
+* old freebsd workaround for libgd removed in #22785
+* ...
