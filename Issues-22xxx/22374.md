Instead of doing it or not depending on the phase of the moon:
    
```
    sage: g = DiGraph([[1..12],lambda i,j: i!=j and i.divides(j)])
    sage: [type(v) for v in g.vertices()]
    [<type 'int'>,
     <type 'int'>,
     <type 'int'>,

     <type 'int'>,
     <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>,
     <type 'int'>,
     <type 'int'>]
```
    
Leaving the vertices alone would be a better fix in principle. Unfortunately, it would break compatibility too badly: for example, people clearly expect to be able to create graphs in library code, using Python ints as labels, and then access the vertices using Sage integers.

I agree that "Leaving the vertices alone would be a better fix".

But I don't understand why you don't just do that. You say that you want to access the vertices using Sage integers, but isn't that possible regardless of whether the vertices are internally stored as `int` or `Integer`?

<a id='comment:11'></a>To the best of my understanding (this code is not easy):
- `c_graph` uses 2 mappings: `vertex_ints` that associates the name of a vertex to the integer used in the internal representation, and `vertex_labels` that associates the integer from the internal representation to the vertex name.
- So even is a vertex name is a small int, the integer used for the internal representation might be different.

This said, I don't understand why we have that

```
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: g.add_vertices([9..12])
sage: [(v, type(v)) for v in g.vertices()]
[(9, <type 'int'>),
 (10, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>),
 (11, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>),
 (12, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>)]
```
Requires more investigation...

<a id='comment:12'></a>When you create an empty digraph using, `DiGraph()`, the `SparseGraph` constructor initializes the data structures for 10 vertices (`int extra_vertices = 10`). This is the initial size of the bitset `active_vertices`. Then, as mentioned above, when adding a vertex `u` whose label is an integer:
1. if `u` is smaller than the current size of `active_vertices`, and that no previously added vertex `v` has been associated to an integer equals to `u`, then vertex `u` is marked as active but not added to mappings `vertex_ints` and `vertex_labels`.
2. if `u` is smaller than the current size of `active_vertices`, but that a previously added vertex `v` has been associated to an integer equals to `u`, then `u` is associated to the first available integer `u_int` in range `0..|active_vertices|-1`, marked as active and added to the mappings `vertex_ints` and `vertex_labels`.
3. if `u` is larger than the current size of `active_vertices`, we map it to the first available integer `u_int` in range `0..|active_vertices|-1`, mark `u_int` as active and add `u` and `u_int` to the mappings
4. when all slots in `active_vertices` are used, we double it's size before adding a new vertex

Consider the following example:

```python
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: g.add_vertices([9, 10, 0])
sage: [(v, type(v)) for v in g]
[(0, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>),
 (10, <type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>),
 (9, <type 'int'>)]
```
When adding vertex `9`, we are in case 1, and so `9` is not added to the mappings. Then, when adding vertex `10`, we are in case 3 so we map it to the first available integer (here 0) and  add it to the mappings. Hence, 10 keeps it's type (here `sage.rings.integer.Integer`), while 9 is of type `int`.
Now, when we add vertex `0`, we are in case 2, and so it will be mapped to 1 and it's type will be `sage.rings.integer.Integer`. It will be the same if we now add vertex `1`...


The motivation of this optimization is to save space and few tests when the user creates vertices in the right order. But above example shows how easy it is to loose this optimization. 

Shouldn't we should simplify the code and use mappings for all vertices ?
It could ease the resolution of issues like in #27037.
