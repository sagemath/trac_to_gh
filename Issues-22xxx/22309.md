This gives drastic improvement for small polytopes which is the target case. Before:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices())")
25 loops, best of 3: 35.2 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices())")
625 loops, best of 3: 684 µs per loop
```
Next in the chain of lattice polytope improvements is #22310
