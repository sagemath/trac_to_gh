The motivation has been [discussed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/jdLfIKQ1M18/LJq-rc2rCgAJ) [numerous](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/92OdoUbBDbE/Uwq78LmxAgAJ) [times](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/JPpJvUpP1TQ/qaZZsdiiCgAJ), and has become a somewhat urgent matter now that R [stopped](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/QaBdHSNJuKg/O_Cl6aMSAwAJ) providing its own implementation.

This ticket aims at documenting this [long known](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/31Snpxt66mU/SZFRClSCrqgJ) dependency, recommend using OpenSSL system-wide and document the possibility of compiling against other libraries with reduced functionality.

it depends on #22058, to allow for successful build against OpenSSL>1.1 (see [this report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/tre-0olasxI/HfYY4anXCAAJ)) : we cannot decently recommend a library if its newer version breaks Sage building...

This ticket does not aim to modify any code, only the documentation (`README.md` and the Sage Installation Guide).

Depends on #22058

Initial proposition.

I noted a few inconsistencies/inecxactitudes while revising the text. I did **not** try to fix them : they require more information and belong to other tickets :

* I'm surprised to see Python as a prequisite in `$SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`...

* Are the instruction about moving the Sage tree still valid ? Somehow, I doubt it !

* Is a system git a prerequisite (as `$SAGE_ROOT/src/doc/en/installation/source.rst` seem to imply)  or not ? If so, having a `git` package is pointless...

Forgot to add :

1. The resulting Sage passes ptestlong with two failures :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.0 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 119.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ideal.py  # 1 doctest failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The first one is transient (test passes fine when run standalone), the second one is an already-known problem.

2. Forgot to set `needs_review`

I'd rather follow the basic requirement of no self-review : it's a basic safeguard against hubris, and, as all basic rules, it can have any value if and only if rigidly followed...

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A23):
> What part of the Sage build will break without `ssl`?

* R will fail to build without an https-capable SSL
* Python won't fail overtly, but the resulting pip won't be able to install or list packages in https-accessed  repositories : nowadays, that means all pip directories.
* ISTR thython license mention this and warns about "reduced functionalities".

The python license recommends openssl ; my tests showed that GnuTLS is able to create a functional R (but not a functional pip). Hence the dependency on "an SSL implementation) and the recommendation of OpenSSL. I didn't test the nss library...

Don't you have some SSL library installed systemwide ? OpenSSL is pretty ubiquitous nowadays (even on Debian base (not desktop !) systems, to the dismay of Jeroen Demeyer....)

Indeed. What I need is a program testing a library common to (at least) OpenSSL and GnuTLS, and able to test the "https-worthiness" of a library. Not exactly a trivial request...

Because [Python does](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html#openssl). Because [R needs curl](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Essential-programs-and-libraries), which does need (some) SSL to reach https repositories.

Indeed. The current documentation requires some SSL library and recommends OpenSSL : not quite the same thing. 

I also proved conclusively that :
* GnuTLS allowed for the successfil compilation of a https-capable R an
* that this GnuTLL library is insufficient for a functional pip.
