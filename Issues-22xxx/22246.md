This is clearly a change to better, so I mark this as positive review.

I am not very sure about every change. Sometimes

```
not( ((some + thing) / long - list * (of - operations)) ) and . . .
```

might be better than

```
not(((some + thing) / long - list * (of - operations))) and . . .
```

But in the

```
s += [str(round( el_color[edge][0],4)), ',']
```

extra spaces are not needed.
