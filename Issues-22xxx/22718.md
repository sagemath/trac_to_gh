```

There isn't any one particular line in the doctests for that module that causes the issue individually.  It just happens inevitably after evaluating enough L-series instances, which is using the gp pexpect interface to do some things.

This seems to be a problem on any platform; it just runs out of file descriptors faster on Cygwin, where the `FD_SETSIZE` for `select()` is 64 (see https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2011-03/msg00651.html).

I wonder if this code could be updated to use the cypari interface instead?

Using the optional package `gp2c` (which compiles GP code to C, analogous to how Cython compiles Python code to C), yes it can. I tried that in #15809 but nobody seemed to care...

Regardless of the scripts, most of the functionality is actually present in PARI itself. So we should get rid of the scripts completely instead of running them in a different way. Me and John Cremona have a plan to look at this, we just need to find an occasion to sit together and do it.

I see--so if we convert the scripts with gp2c and compile their functionality into the pari interface (also, how does this fit in with cypari2?) then the rest can be done through the pari interface.

Would I be able to help revive #15809 for now, until/unless a better approach is available?

E.g. `gammaV` -> `gammaV_{i}` where `i` would be replaced with an integer for each `Dokchitser` instance?  So for each instance a new script would be generated from the template and run within the same `gp` interpreter.  When a `Dokchitser` instance goes out of scope, if it's not the only one remaining (i.e. the interpreter should be kept running) the `__del__` would just `kill()` all the global variables for that instance to free up memory.
