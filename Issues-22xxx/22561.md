The following reasonable and apparently innocuous code sends Sage into an infinite loop:

```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
sage: list(p)
```

The reason is that the gen object has no `__iter__` method, but it has a `__getitem__` method which accepts any integer index and returns 0 for indices larger than the degree of the polynomial.  Since there is no `__iter__` method, python builds an iterator using `__getitem__`.

Can you give an example of a Python container which allows `X[n]` for `n > len(X)`??
