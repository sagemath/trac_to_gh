The following reasonable and apparently innocuous code sends Sage into an infinite loop:

```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
sage: list(p)
```

The reason is that the gen object has no `__iter__` method, but it has a `__getitem__` method which accepts any integer index and returns 0 for indices larger than the degree of the polynomial.  Since there is no `__iter__` method, python builds an iterator using `__getitem__`.

Implementing `__iter__` was definitely the right thing to do, and this implementation works great for me, testing in `CyPari`.  Thanks!

Although it is wonderful to have `__iter__`, I still think that `__getitem__` should raise an `IndexError` if one tries to access a t_POL coefficient with negative index, or index larger than the degree. This just makes sense, and also is consistent with how it works for power series.

I ran into a minor compatibility issue (i.e. a Cython bug) with Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04: `Cython 0.25.2` had trouble parsing the f"..." formatted strings passed to warn or `TypeError`.  The error looks like this:

```
            from warnings import warn
            warn(f"iterating a PARI {self.type()} is deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
                 ^
------------------------------------------------------------

cypari_src/gen.pyx:320:18: Expected ')', found 'BEGIN_STRING'
```
This did not happen on macOS using Python 3.6.

Sorry to ask, but can you please double-check that this was indeed using Cython 0.25.2 and not some earlier version? Support for `f`-strings was added only recently to Cython.

    "body": "<a id='comment:14'></a>\nVincent, I am having trouble following your logic.  Why should it be correct to ask for the coefficient of `x^-3` in a polynomial?  I agree that if a polynomial were a special case of a power series (with infinite precision) then it might make sense to pretend that there were coefficients of all positive degrees.  You might similarly argue that a polynomial is a special case of a Laurent polynomial, or Laurent series.  But we are talking about how to model these concepts as Python objects.  We expect Python subclasses to override methods of their parent class in a way which reflects how the structure of the subclass differs from that of the parent. So we should expect polynomials to override `__getitem__` and `__len__` in a way which reflects the differences between a polynomial and a power series or Laurent polynomial or Laurent series.\n\nCan you give an example of a Python container which allows `X[n]` for `n > len(X)`??",

Vincent, I am having trouble following your logic.  Why should it be correct to ask for the coefficient of `x^-3` in a polynomial?  I agree that if a polynomial were a special case of a power series (with infinite precision) then it might make sense to pretend that there were coefficients of all positive degrees.  You might similarly argue that a polynomial is a special case of a Laurent polynomial, or Laurent series.  But we are talking about how to model these concepts as Python objects.  We expect Python subclasses to override methods of their parent class in a way which reflects how the structure of the subclass differs from that of the parent. So we should expect polynomials to override `__getitem__` and `__len__` in a way which reflects the differences between a polynomial and a power series or Laurent polynomial or Laurent series.

Can you give an example of a Python container which allows `X[n]` for `n > len(X)`??

A polynomial is not a container.

The dictionary `{2: 'hello'}` :-P. More seriously, polynomials in GP behave that way

```
? p = x^3 + 2
%1 = x^3 + 2
? length(p)
%2 = 4
? polcoeff(p, 5) 
%3 = 0
? polcoeff(p, -3)
%4 = 0
```

On a related note, see that integers have numerators and denominators!

```
sage: 12.numerator()
12
sage: 12.denominator()
1

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: p = R(x^2 - 3*x + 2)
sage: p[25]
0
sage: p[-2]
0
```
