```
The following reasonable and apparently innocuous code sends Sage into an infinite loop:

```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
sage: list(p)
```

The reason is that the gen object has no `__iter__` method, but it has a `__getitem__` method which accepts any integer index and returns 0 for indices larger than the degree of the polynomial.  Since there is no `__iter__` method, python builds an iterator using `__getitem__`.

Depends on #22471

 The following reasonable and apparently innocuous code sends Sage into an infinite loop:

 sage: p = pari('x^2 + x + 1')
 sage: list(p)

 The reason is that the gen object has no `__iter__` method, but it has a `__getitem__` method which accepts any integer index and returns 0 for indices larger than the degree of the polynomial.  Since there is no `__iter__` method, python builds an iterator using `__getitem__`.

Implementing `__iter__` was definitely the right thing to do, and this implementation works great for me, testing in `CyPari`.  Thanks!

Although it is wonderful to have `__iter__`, I still think that `__getitem__` should raise an `IndexError` if one tries to access a t_POL coefficient with negative index, or index larger than the degree. This just makes sense, and also is consistent with how it works for power series.

I ran into a minor compatibility issue (i.e. a Cython bug) with Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04: `Cython 0.25.2` had trouble parsing the f"..." formatted strings passed to warn or `TypeError`.  The error looks like this:

```
            from warnings import warn
            warn(f"iterating a PARI {self.type()} is deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
                 ^
------------------------------------------------------------

cypari_src/gen.pyx:320:18: Expected ')', found 'BEGIN_STRING'
```
This did not happen on macOS using Python 3.6.

Sorry to ask, but can you please double-check that this was indeed using Cython 0.25.2 and not some earlier version? Support for `f`-strings was added only recently to Cython.

The dictionary `{2: 'hello'}` :-P. More seriously, polynomials in GP behave that way

```

I guess the bottom line here is that Sage's polynomial ring handles polynomial coefficients that way:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: p = R(x^2 - 3*x + 2)
sage: p[25]

sage: p[-2]
0
