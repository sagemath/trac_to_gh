<a id='comment:4'></a>The code looks good.

1) Why these new methods are cpdef? It will make any difference if you **repeatedly** call such method. Which I do not think is the case for most application.

2) The logic of

```
shift = False
if shifts:
    shift = True
```
is quite confusing. You can use `if shifts` instead of `if shift` anywhere.

3) Does `hermite_form_reversed` just the transposed of the hermite form of the transposed matrix or with respect to row/column ordering? If so, you can just remove the method (one can apply some permutations of entries first and then call the standard algorithm). If not, you should clarify the documentation.

4) As far as I can see, most of the code in `_hermite_form_euclidean` is not polynomial specific but would work as soon as you have `xgcd`. The only missing piece is the normalization to monic polynomial. Am I right? In that case, it would be good to have this code available more generally.

5) Instead of

```
if transformation:
    U = A._hermite_form_euclidean(transformation=True)
    if not include_zero_rows:
        i = A.nrows() - 1
        while i >= 0 and A.row(i) == 0:
            i -= 1
        A = A[:i+1]
        U = U[:i+1]
    return A, U
else:
    A._hermite_form_euclidean(transformation=False)
    if not include_zero_rows:
        i = A.nrows() - 1
        while i >= 0 and A.row(i) == 0:
            i -= 1
        A = A[:i+1]
    return A
```
why not

```
U = A._hermite_form_euclidean(transformation=transformation)
if not include_zero_rows:
    i = A.nrows() - 1
    while i >= 0 and A.row(i) == 0:
        i -= 1
    A = A[:i+1]
    if transformation
        U = U[:i+1]

return (A, U) if transformation else A
```

7) You claim that there is a speed up. Could you provide some relevant timings?

Reversing the entries will definitely not be time critical (zero copy, it is just swapping some pointers). The algorithm will spend much more time doing polynomial divisions. Am I correct that you call the row-and-column reversed matrix `(i,j) -> m[nrows - i - 1, ncols - j - 1]`?

If I had to choose I would implement only `hermite_form` and do in your algorithm

```
my_matrix.reverse_rows_and_columns()
hnf = my_matrix.hermite_form()
my_matrix.reverse_rows_and_columns()  # put back the matrix in the right order
```
If you need help, I can implement this `reverse_rows_and_columns`.

I know. I once experimented with that row-and-column reversing. At that time, I was obsessed with timings and could not afford even that small time losing in reversing. My application computes lots of reversed hermite form. Here it is

https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22982

if you are interested.

> Am I correct that you call the row-and-column reversed matrix `(i,j) -> m[nrows - i - 1, ncols - j - 1]`?


Yes.

Can you think of an implementation simpler or faster than this?

```
def reverse_rows_and_columns(m):
    return matrix([e for e in reversed(m.list())])
```

Now they are `def` methods.

That will incur many useless conversions (from a list to a boolean). I kept `shift` but reshaped the code slightly to be less confusing, hopefully.

True. But for that, the normalization part should be removed, and I am not interested in doing this work myself. I want to leave this work to a separate ticket and to others.

Done. Thanks.

This is not true:

```
boolean (default: ``None``) A tuple or list of integers
```
Also, the boolean check of, e.g., a list should be very quick and insignificant in terms of speed, but it can make the code easier to maintain in the long run.

Something I have found that I wish Python would do is return the object even when you do something that mutates it. This allows you to chain operations together in a more natural way, e.g.,

```
M._weak_popov_form().transpose()

+1. There is no such thing as a conversion. `if my_list` is as fast as it can be. Anyway, if you seriously care about speed, this is not the kind of things you want to optimize.

My previous response to this comment was somewhat adequate. I now try to answer again.

I didn't want to put the code into a more general place like `matrix2.pyx`, because that would incur some condition checking for every call of `hermite_form`.  It was just clean to put the code into the file dedicated for polynomial matrices.

<a id='comment:40'></a>The present `hermite_form` method returns an immutable matrix only when `include_zero_rows=False`, because of the side effect of taking `A[:i]`. This raises some questions:

(1) Should `hermite_form` always return an immutable matrix?

(2) `A[:i]` returns an immutable matrix even if A is not? Is this expected or a bug?

If the answer to (1) is true, then `reversed_hermite_form` cannot be obtained just by wrapping `hermite_form` with `reverse_rows_and_columns` because you cannot "reverse" an immutable matrix.
