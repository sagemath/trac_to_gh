The change is significant. CPython3 still uses the same underlying logic, so that should still work, but it looks like it will be difficult to support both Py2 and Py3 with the same source. Do we have conditional compilation flags in cython for such cases? I imagine the transition is smoothest if we can ensure that we can support Py2 and Py3 from a single source, at least for a while.

If I recall correctly: `PyDict_GetItemWithError` is available in Py3.

For the rest, it should just be `del_dictitem_by_exact_value` that needs rewriting to account for the renaming of certain structures and, most importantly, dealing with split tables (which is new) as well as combined tables (which are basically the old dict lay-out).

It may be worth checking if the special trick used to participate in the Python Trashcan is still necessary with Py3.

Iteration protection has changed in Py3 as well a bit, so perhaps we don't quite need the protection we're enforcing in deletion anymore.

I think presently the "contains" test also reaches into the internal structure. However, "contains" doesn't really produce verifiable results on a WeakValueDict anyway, because the member can always disappear between the containment test and retrieval, so we could not override that routine (in the same way that "len" is not overridden).

For me the main issues that prevent me from fixing this issue are that I don't have access to a platform where I can compile cython against python 3 and that I don't know how to make cython source compile conditionally wrt. Py2 vs. Py3. It's probably easier if someone who does know how to deal with those things makes the necessary adjustments. It's not rocket science, but you do have to carefully read dictobject.c

If we could somehow link to [delitem_common](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/dictobject.c#L1587) the deletion would almost be taken care of. I'm afraid that's not an exported symbol, though, so we basically have to replicate it.

Also, perhaps we should always force the WeakValueDict to be "combined" (the old-style layout), because split tables don't allow deletion, and triggering reshaping of the dictionary in a weakref callback is probably not a good idea.

Is there an easy way to get a "cython+python3" setup on which I can try weak_dict? I do recall how I made it work on py2, so I might be in a reasonable position to adapt it to py3.

Do we need a way to switch between the two? I don't think it will be so easy to make a version that works on both py2 and py3 (given that we reach into dicts beyond what's exposed by the API)

Ping to chapoton. Did you need a fix urgently? The file attached here does solve the compilation issue on Python3.6.

Yes, I looked into that and came up with nothing either. I got the impression that the `setup.py` file would be the place to set a flag depending on the target, and then use "IF" in cython to do a conditional compile. We could separate out the code for `delete_by_exact_value` into a separate file if that makes things a little cleaner. That's the only routine that depends on the implementation details of `dict`.

It looks like the Cython IF is a little more restricted that the C preprocessor one. I tried 
`IF PY_HEX_VERSION > 0x03060000:` but couldn't get it to work.

The mechanism to pass compile-time variables to cython (for use in IF ...) seems to be something along the lines of:

```
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
from sys import version_info

if version_info.major <= 2:
    env = {'PYTHON_VERSION': 2}
elif version_info.major == 3 and version_info.minor >= 6:
    env = {'PYTHON_VERSION': 3}
else:
    raise RuntimeError("Unsupported version")

setup(
    name = 'weak_dict',
    ext_modules = cythonize("weak_dict.pyx",compile_time_env=env),
)
```
I have no idea where put this in sage, though. I haven't been able to find the "setup" command that is relevant for "weak_dict".

It seems we can simply add `sys.hexversion` as `PY_VERSION_HEX` (which is the CAPI name of the variable) to the compile-time environment for all sage cythonization. That should be fairly low-cost.

I have split off the python-version-sensitive code into a separate file, which seems to work fine. Code replication is now a lot more limited. If someone sees an economic way of sharing the docstring, that would be great. On the other hand, these two implementations are so different that having different docs (and tests?) for them might make sense.

I have tested compiling it within sage on Py2.7 and directly on Python3.6 via the following setup.py:

```
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize
import sys

setup(
    name = 'weak_dict',
    ext_modules = cythonize(["weak_dict.pyx","dict_del_by_value.pyx"],compile_time_env={'PY_VERSION_HEX':sys.hexversion}),
)
```

Since this routine breaks the abstraction of "PyDict" I am pretty sure the code would not get accepted as an API change. The only thing that I could see happening is that python might accept the routine as an internal one and put `WeakValueDict` in C to use it.

The only option I see to do this "cleanly" outside of Python is to implement our own `WeakValueDict` from scratch, i.e., don't base it on `dict`. I don't think that is less maintenance burden than tracking python's dict, and certainly a larger change than the one on this ticket at this point in sage.
