Polyhedra can be instantiated with different backends (CDD, PPL, normaliz, ...), and the `base_extend` method is supposed to allow to transform between backends, but the parameter is simply ignored (in (`Polyhedra_base.base_extend`).



Possible follow-up: Also a new method `change_backend` could be implemented as an alias. (Once done, add it to tutorial, too.)

`base_extend` should do the job. But actually... the optional parameter to change the backend is simply not used at all!?!?!?!

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0), (0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], base_ring=ZZ);  P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray
sage: P_cdd = P.base_extend(base_ring=ZZ,backend='cdd')
sage: type(P_cdd)
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.backend_ppl.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category.element_class'>
```

This is because in the parent class, the method `.base_extend()` of `parent` does not even use the optional parameter `backend`...

```
sage: par = P.parent()
sage: par.base_extend??     # this is worth looking at...
```

I guess one could simply correct that...

Now the question is whether there is a smart way to go from one to another?

good finding, maybe this was a feature that didn't get in at the time. 

also, i didn't find a command to get the backend as a string, like `P.backend()`, or `P.get_backend()`. it seems that there is no object (list) of `available_backends` either. 

> I guess one could simply correct that...

i suggest to just start with the naive way and see how it behaves.

So my only quip is that this defaults to the automatic backend choice when the backend is not specified. I would expect that the backend be the same backend as what I am currently working with:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0), (0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], base_ring=QQ)
sage: P.backend()
'ppl'
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0), (0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], base_ring=ZZ, backend='normaliz')
sage: P.backend()
'normaliz'
sage: P.base_extend(QQ).backend()
'ppl'
```
So if you think this is the behavior that it should have, then you should put a `.. WARNING::` explaining that the backend is given by the default if not specified.

> So my only quip is that this defaults to the automatic backend choice when the backend is not specified. I would expect that the backend be the same backend as what I am currently working with:

I'll add some documentation.
