<a id='comment:10'></a>Dear Frédéric, I've reviewed your changes, but see comments below this list for a possible future of this ticket:

- Some doctests did not pass (see also the following comments); however, as this ticket was not set to "needs review", I assume that these were just not investigated yet.

- asymptotics_multi...: LGTM, but see comment below this list.

- growth_group.py, line 1196:

```
return richcmp(self._raw_element_, other._raw_element_, op)
```
This does not make sense for a `GenericGrowthElement` (as there is no `<` on it defined).

- growth_group.py, line 3643: The following was rewritten, but the new code is not equivalent to the old:

```
        return bool(abs(self.base) < abs(other.base)) or \
               bool(self.base == other.base)
```
vs

```
        if not isinstance(other, ExponentialGrowthElement):
            return op == op_NE

        lx = self.base
        ly = other.base
        if lx == ly:
            return rich_to_bool(op, 0)

        return richcmp(abs(lx), abs(ly), op)
```
For example: `self.base=1`, `other.base=-1`, `op=op_LE` would incorrectly return `True`.
I think, that this is the origin of the failing doctests.

- term_monoid.py, lines 2915-2933: Maybe a matter of taste, but it looks like the code has blown up quite much (there is even some code doubling); this does not improve readability.

- The patchbot reports also this:

```
File "src/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 1406, in sage.calculus.calculus.laplace
Failed example:
    laplace(t^n, t, s, algorithm='giac')
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Giac output: integrate(t^n*exp(-s*t),t,0,+infinity)
Got:
    integration(t^n*e^(-s*t), t, 0, +Infinity)
```
I have no glue why this is failing. I cannot imagine that this comes from the changes of this ticket. Any ideas?

When the asymptotic expansion module was written, I had the change in comparison in my mind and tried to prepare everything for it, so that it will be easy at one point. This point seems to be now; I've partially reverted your changes and have prepared a own patch to address the issues of this ticket.
Overall, the code now is much cleaner (compared to the original code) and I am satisified with it.

- Can you please check: Is this is now still Python3 comparision-compatible? (I think so, but it is surely easier for you to tell. ;)

- The main change was to introduce a kind of low-level `_richcmp_` which can be used more broadly. As a consequence only high-level `_eq_` and `_lt_` (very close to the Python 3 recommendation on how to implement comparison, but single underscores to use SageMath's convention on coercion) have to be implemented. I think this is a very convenient to implement new partial orders.

- In asymptotics_multi..., I've deleted the the comparison `<`, as it is mathematically not meaningful and only needed in filtering out multiple factors in the denominator. There is now used a key, where this sorting is needed.
