There is currently:

```

sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(1,0), (0,1)], rays=[(1,1)], base_ring=ZZ);  P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray
sage: P_QQ = P.base_extend(QQ); P_QQ
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray

```

Could there be a boolean parameter such as `inplace` (similar as in graphs and simplicial complexes...) to determine if one should create a new object or just change the base ring?

I am wondering how much changing the base ring changes the internals of the polyhedron object. Would many things break? We can try and see...

Agreed.

Further, I don't really like the fact that hidden in `base_extend` is the possibility to change the backend, which as a matter of fact doesn't work. This is not user-friendly to say the least. I would therefore also deprecate the keyword completely and point to a `.change_backend()` method (see #22575).

Hi,

Here are a couple of things I saw:

- Adapt the convention for the input, see for example `vertex_facet_graph`:

```diff
+        - ``backend`` -- the new backend, see
+            :func:`~sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor.Polyhedron`.
+            If ``None`` (the default), use the same defaulting behavior
+            as described there; it is not attempted to keep the same
+            backend.
```
- It would be good to have more examples with all the potential pairings.

- Further, it would be nice to handle the potential error in the function when coercing from `QQ` to `ZZ` and return a message like: 'Can not change the ring to `ZZ`: a coordinate is rational'. And these examples should be added after the examples that do work.
