```python
(x>17).plot()
```
returns an Expression rather than a Graphics object.  More specifically, it
returns an Expression with the representation

```
x |--> x > 17
```

Trying to plot this expression (plotting the output of a plot function seems unreasonable, still tried it since the output was an expression...) raised

```pytb
