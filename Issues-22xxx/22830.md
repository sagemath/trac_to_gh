```python
(x>17).plot()
```
returns an Expression rather than a Graphics object.  More specifically, it
returns an Expression with the representation

```
x |--> x > 17
```

Trying to plot this expression (plotting the output of a plot function seems unreasonable, still tried it since the output was an expression...) raised

```pytb
Traceback (most recent call last):

so this code has been in there for a very long time (since it was in calculus/calculus.py).  I'm not sure why it returns a function in those cases.  The question remains of what it *should* return, since we don't really know in this case even if a one-d or two-d plot would be imagined.
