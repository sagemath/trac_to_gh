There is [PyPolymake](https://github.com/videlec/pypolymake), to be added at #21170. But I think it wouldn't hurt to additionally have a pexpect interface to Polymake. And the purpose of this ticket is to create one.

Depends on #22501

Here I am showcasing some things that work already:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.polymake import polymake
sage: polymake.help("objects/Cone/properties/Combinatorics/RAYS_IN_FACETS")
property RAYS_IN_FACETS : IncidenceMatrix<NonSymmetric>
 Ray-facet incidence matrix, with rows corresponding to facets and columns
 to rays. Rays and facets are numbered from 0 to N_RAYS-1 rsp.
 N_FACETS-1, according to their order in RAYS rsp. FACETS.

sage: polymake.help('rand_sphere')
functions/Producing a polytope from scratch/rand_sphere:
rand_sphere(d, n; Options) -> Polytope

 Produce a d-dimensional polytope with n random vertices
 uniformly distributed on the unit sphere.

Arguments:
  Int d the dimension
  Int n the number of random vertices

Options:
  seed => Int controls the outcome of the random number generator;
    fixing a seed number guarantees the same outcome. 

Returns Polytope 
```
So, there is access to Polymake' help system.

```
sage: P = polymake.rand<tab key>
                polymake.rand01                polymake.rand_knot              
                polymake.rand_aof              polymake.rand_metric            
                polymake.rand_box              polymake.rand_metric_int       >
                polymake.rand_cyclic           polymake.rand_perm              
                polymake.rand_inner_points     polymake.rand_seed 
```
So, tab completion of the interface itself works, it yields ALL function names, including those that are not part of the current Polymake application.

```
sage: P = polymake.rand_sphere(3,10,seed=5)
```
So, calling a function with parameters works

```
sage: P
Random spherical polytope of dimension 3; seed=5
```
So, string representation works, actually nicer than in Polymake (more examples below).

```
sage: P.known_properties()   # members computed so far
['BOUNDED', 'CONE_AMBIENT_DIM', 'FEASIBLE', 'POINTS']
sage: P.get_schedule('F_VECTOR')

precondition : BOUNDED ( lrs.convex_hull.count: N_FACETS : RAYS | INPUT_RAYS )
lrs.convex_hull.count: N_FACETS : RAYS | INPUT_RAYS
sensitivity check for VertexPerm
cdd.convex_hull.canon: POINTED, RAYS, LINEALITY_SPACE : INPUT_RAYS
CONE_DIM : RAYS | INPUT_RAYS
N_RAYS : RAYS
precondition : POINTED ( LINEALITY_DIM, LINEALITY_SPACE : )
LINEALITY_DIM, LINEALITY_SPACE :
COMBINATORIAL_DIM : CONE_DIM, LINEALITY_DIM
precondition : COMBINATORIAL_DIM ( F_VECTOR : N_FACETS, N_RAYS, COMBINATORIAL_DIM )
F_VECTOR : N_FACETS, N_RAYS, COMBINATORIAL_DIM
```
So, this shows how the f-vector would be computed for this polytope.

```
sage: V = P.VER<tab key>
                P.VERTEX_BARYCENTER        P.VERTICES                 
                P.VERTEX_LABELS            P.VERTICES_IN_FACETS       
                P.VERTEX_NORMALS           P.VERTICES_IN_INEQUALITIES 
                P.VERTEX_SIZES             P.VERY_AMPLE               
```
So, tab completion for Polymake elements works. It shows both members (including those that aren't computed yet) and functions (including those that won't be applicable to the object).

```
sage: set_verbose(3)
sage: V = P.VERTICES
sage: F = P.F_VECTOR
polymake: used package lrs
  Implementation of the reverse search algorithm of Avis and Fukuda.
  Copyright by David Avis.
  http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~avis/lrs.html
```
So, when verbosity is set to a positive value, comments printed by Polymake will be printed by Sage.

```
So, string representation is (at least for the things that are currently wrapped) meaningful.

```
sage: F[2]
16
sage: V[3][3]
-6735311418008155/18014398509481984
```
So, attribute access works.

```
sage: V.foobar()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: polymake:  ERROR: Undefined subroutine &Polymake::User::foobar called at input line 1.
sage: polymake.eval('foobar(4)')
^CInterrupting Polymake...
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
KeyboardInterrupt: Ctrl-c pressed while running Polymake
sage: polymake.eval('foobar(4);')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
PolymakeError: polymake:  ERROR: Undefined subroutine &Polymake::User::foobar called at input line 1.
```
So, error handling is implemented.

Meanwhile, more members are known:

```
sage: P.known_properties()

['AFFINE_HULL',
 'BOUNDED',
 'COMBINATORIAL_DIM',
 'CONE_AMBIENT_DIM',
 'CONE_DIM',
 'FAR_FACE',
 'FEASIBLE',
 'FULL_DIM',
 'F_VECTOR',
 'LINEALITY_DIM',
 'LINEALITY_SPACE',
 'N_FACETS',
 'N_POINTS',
 'N_VERTICES',
 'POINTED',
 'POINTS',
 'VERTICES']
```

Of course, some things won't work yet. For example, I am not catching warnings yet.

Now I am totally puzzled. After doing some changes, many thinks didn't work. Thus, I reverted all changes. I even deleted my local git branch and downloaded the branch from here. But things still don't work (tab completion etc). Of course I did sage -br.

Do you have any idea what could cause such persisting problems?

```json
{
    "body": "<a id='comment:16'></a>\nIt is of course conceivable that I am just lacking experience, but I find Perl sucks.\n\nIn order to write an interface, it is important to do things uniformly. Hence, all variables created by Sage in Polymake should be \"the same\". In the current branch, \"the same\" means that they are all references (which in Perl means they are SCALAR).\n\nSo, how to assign any object x in Polymake to a variable var?\n\nIf you define a SCALAR \"var\" and assign to \"x\", you of course do not get a reference to x but some scalar interpretation of whatever is in x. Thus, I need to create a reference to x. Sounds trivial (and perhaps it is). However, all what I found is that one needs to do `$var=\\@x`, `$var=\\%x` or `$var=\\*x` depending on whether x is an array, a hash or an io stream. OK, sounds easy.

It is of course conceivable that I am just lacking experience, but I find Perl sucks.

In order to write an interface, it is important to do things uniformly. Hence, all variables created by Sage in Polymake should be "the same". In the current branch, "the same" means that they are all references (which in Perl means they are SCALAR).

So, how to assign any object x in Polymake to a variable var?

If you define a SCALAR "var" and assign to "x", you of course do not get a reference to x but some scalar interpretation of whatever is in x. Thus, I need to create a reference to x. Sounds trivial (and perhaps it is). However, all what I found is that one needs to do `$var=\@x`, `$var=\%x` or `$var=\*x` depending on whether x is an array, a hash or an io stream. OK, sounds easy. But so far I found no way to make Perl tell me what x really is.

Instead, let var uniformly be an array whose single entry is x. Thus:

```
polytope > @P = [rand_sphere(4,33, seed=>5)];

polytope > print @P[0];

polymake:  ERROR: Scalar value @Polymake::User::P[0] better written as $Polymake::User::P[0] at input line 1.
```
WTF?? I should better replace something that I did *not* write??? From what I thought I have learnt about Perl syntax, `@P[0]` should give the first entry in the array P!

Aha, my mistake. Apparently it works slightly differently:

```
polytope > @P = (rand_sphere(4,33, seed=>5));
polytope > print $P[0];
Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational=ARRAY(0x80d0370)
polytope > print $P[0][1];
Random spherical polytope of dimension 4; seed=5
```

So, creating a new variable that points to the content of the old variable should work like this, and it does:

```
polytope > @Q = ($P[0]);

polytope > print $Q[0];
Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational=ARRAY(0x80d0370)
polytope > print $Q[0][1];
Random spherical polytope of dimension 4; seed=5
```
Access to members also works as expected:

```
polytope > @V = ($Q[0]->VERTICES);
...
polytope > print $V[0];
...

Apparently there are no arrays of arrays in Perl. Instead, each item in an array has to be a scalar. Hence, an array of arrays would in fact be implemented as an array of *references* to arrays.

WTF??

I suppose the problem here is that in the line `$L->[0] = $S->[0]->list;` perl puts a scalar value into the first entry of the list that L points to. In contrast to what I thought perl would do, it does not put a *reference* (which is a scalar) to `$S->[0]->list` into the first entry of L, but it puts there a scalar interpretation of the array `$S->[0]->list` --- which is the length of that array.

Crap.

I will now try this model:

- A variable created by Sage in the interface are arrays.
- Such variable either corresponds to a genuine Perl array, or it is an array of length one whose single entry is a reference to some Polymake object.
- I only need to distinguish one thing: If var is an array of length>0, then it is guaranteed to be a genuine Perl array, and we consistently use var as `@var`. Otherwise, we use it in the form `$var[0]`.
- Since the length of the array is determined at the time of its creation, I can store an attribute in the Sage wrapper that tells what case we'll have to deal with.
- As far as I can see, the only problem would be a genuine Perl array x of length 1, that we would mistakenly interpret as a Polymake object wrapped in x; this would only be problematic if the array x would later be modified.

Anyway. I will next try to use this approach to assign `expr` in Polymake to a variable:
- `@SAGE0 = (expr);`, and `"SAGE0"` is the autogenerated name of a Sage wrapper for expr.
- Test the length of `@SAGE0`. If the length is 1, then the sage wrapper stores the information that to access the wrapped value it has to use `$SAGE0[0]`. Otherwise, it stores the information that to access the wrapped value it has to use `@SAGE0`.
- Do not care about the case that `expr` is an array of length one.

I am not totally happy with the string representation of this, but I guess it is still nice enough. Note that a different package is used compared with what is stated in the tutorial. Probably this is because of a different polymake version:

```
sage: set_verbose(0)
sage: polymake.version()
'3.0'
```
whereas the tutorial uses version 2.9.6.

With the pexpect interface, it is also possible to create a new instance of a Polymake class, but the typical name ("`new`") is not available, as a method with this name but with a different semantics exists in Sage's interface framework. So, I chose a different name:

```
sage: q = polymake.new_from_type("Polytope", INEQUALITIES=[[5,-4,0,1],[-3,0,-4,1],[-2,1,0,0],[-4,4,4,-1],[0,0,1,0],[8,0,0,-1],[1,0,-1,0],[3,-1,0,0]])
sage: q
Polytope<Rational>[SAGE45]
```
Again, the string representation could be subject of discussion. The current proposal is to take into account the type name and the name of the Sage variable representing the instance.

I think the order of facets has changed between versions, since some of the following differs from what is in the tutorial:

```

Here I show that Polymake's warnings are taken care of (and so are errors):

```

I think I will change the strategy for wrapping yet again.

__Basic problem to solve__

In Perl, the different basic types HASH, ARRAY, SCALAR, and IO require a different syntax in order to perform "equivalent" operations on them. Even to assign some data X to a variable, the required syntax depends on the type of X. So, if I don't know in advance the type of some data X then there's your problem.

My current approach is to store all data in an ARRAY: If the data X is in fact an ARRAY then the wrap is the same as X, as Perl doesn't know arrays of arrays; otherwise the wrap is a list of length one containing X. So, assigning data X to a wrapper variable W, I know how to do so independent of the type of X. For all subsequent operations on X, I can test the type of the first entry of W (if len(W)==1) respectively I know that X is the same as W, and then know what to do.

Caveat: My current approach would fail if X happens to be an array of length 1.

I think a cleaner solution would be this: Write a little Perl function `get_type_of`, such that `get_type_of(X)` returns the array `("ARRAY", X)` resp. `("HASH", X)` resp. `("SCALAR", X)` depending on the type of X --- this could probably be done by some "try - catch" magic.

Now, when wrapping a polymake object in the pexpect interface, the output of `get_type_of` would be used to determine whether we need to evaluate `$SAGE1 = X;` or `@SAGE1 = X;` or `%SAGE1 = X;` to create the wrapper. Of course, the type would be stored, so that in all later operations it is clear whether, for example, item access is done be `@SAGE1[14]` or `%SAGE1{14}`.

But this has to wait for later, as I should be busy with different things today.

Andreas Paffenholz has just pointed out to me how to parse the output of `apropos "";` in order to not only get the functions of the current application, but also to get member and member function names, which is important for tab completion respectively for knowing what a Sage user means when she types `X.name_of_something`: An property of X? A polymake function that, when called, is applied to X **and** further given arguments? A member function of X that, when called, is evaluated **only** on the further given arguments?

Also I made some experiments with KeyboardInterrupt. Sometimes I found that it crashed the interface (i.e., `polymake._expect` became None), and so far I don't understand why this can happen, and why it doesn't *always* happen.

In addition to the problem with keyboard interrupt, I got this problem (probably related):

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.polymake import polymake
sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(4,23, seed=5)
sage: t = p.TRIANGULATION
sage: t?
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
RuntimeError: Polymake terminated unexpectedly while reading in a large line:
unknown help topic 'Polymake::topaz::GeometricSimplicialComplex__Rational::__as__Polymake::polytope::Polytope::_prop_TRIANGULATION'
```

Andreas and Julian have told me a bit more about several kinds of type names, and it seems they would be useful both to access the documentation and to get a more accurate list of available properties and member functions.

A new complication arose: So far, the patterns I was looking for with pexpect have been `application_name > ` (normal prompt), `application_name (digits) > ` (that's the continuation prompt), `killed by signal`, `polymake: ERROR:`, and `polymake: WARNING`.

But I have just learned that when asking for `help "Triangulation"` there is yet another prompt to take care of:

```
polytope > help "TRIANGULATION";
There are 5 help topics matching 'TRIANGULATION':
1: objects/Cone/properties/Triangulation and volume/TRIANGULATION
2: objects/Polytope/properties/Triangulation and volume/TRIANGULATION
3: objects/Visualization/Visual::PointConfiguration/methods/TRIANGULATION
4: objects/Visualization/Visual::Polytope/methods/TRIANGULATION
5: objects/PointConfiguration/properties/Triangulation and volume/TRIANGULATION
-------------------
Please choose those interesting you via history navigation (ArrowUp/ArrowDown):

polytope [1]> 
```
I was told by the polymake developers at SageDays84 that the prompt with square brackets will only arise when requesting help.

So, what shall we do in such situation? Display the available information (using `_sage_doc_`) and leave it to the user to access the different help topics? Always choose the first available help option? Other ideas?

The last commits provide full doctest coverage and passes (on my machine) both without polymake (then running `sage -t`) and with polymake (then running `sage -t --optional=sage,polymake`).

**__Caveats__**

- I assume in the tests that the Polymake version is what is currently available by `sage -i polymake`: It is version 3.0. Hopefully that's fine.
- The test for `_keyboard_interact` is quite flaky. Interactively, it sometimes results in a warning, sometimes in an AttributeError, sometimes it just works as stated. I have no clue concerning the reasons. Anyway, I marked it as "not tested".
- In the test for `_sage_doc_`, I mention another thing I don't understand: When I do

  ```
  sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3,13, seed=12)
  sage: p.get_schedule?
  ```
  one does not get the Polymake documentation of `get_schedule`, even though

  ```
  sage: print p.get_schedule._sage_doc_()
  objects/Core::Object/methods/get_schedule:
  get_schedule(request;  ... ) -> Core::RuleChain
  
   Compose an optimal chain of production rules providing all requested properties.
   The returned RuleChain object can be applied to the original object as well as to any other object
   with the same initial set of properties.  If no feasible rule chain exists, `undef' is returned.
  
   To watch the rule scheduler at work, e.g. to see announcements about tried preconditions,
   you may temporarily increase the verbosity levels $Verbose::rules and $Verbose::scheduler.
  
  Arguments:
    String request : name of a property with optional alternatives or a property path in dotted notation.
      Several requests may be listed.
  
  Returns Core::RuleChain 
  ```
  does the right thing. In contrast,

  ```
  sage: p.minkowski_sum_fukuda?
  ```
  just works. Strange.

Anyway, I think it is good enough for being reviewed!

Thank you for testing.

The failures, as much as I see, are all harmless in the sense that simply the string representation of an object was enriched or the documentation was changed or Polymake's strategy for computing a property has changed.

What is the policy? Should the doctests for an optional package be written with respect to what you would get from the current version of the optional package, or should be "future proof" to all possible extent?

first pass

- The program is `polymake` and not `Polymake`

- need an entry in the reference manual `src/doc/en/reference/interfaces/index.rst`

- your method `version` is somehow broken. You are using the program `polymake` and not
  the command that was transmitted by the user. Andreas suggested

```
polytope > print $Polymake::Version;
3.0.9
```

- you use twice `os.getenv('SAGE_POLYMAKE_COMMAND') or 'polymake'`. One possibility would
  be to set a variable named `SAGE_POLYMAKE_COMMAND` at the module level once for all
  and use it all along.

- the install hints should give more details about polymake installation (e.g. the SPKG.txt
  contains some subtle details)

- in the doctest of `application` I would suggest to not quit and start but rather

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: polymake.application('polytope')
    sage: 'tubing_of_graph' in dir(polymake)
    False
    sage: polymake.application('tropical')
    sage: 'tubing_of_graph' in dir(polymake)
    True
    sage: polymake.application('polytope')
    sage: 'tubing_of_graph' in dir(polymake)
    False
```

- (just a remark) polymake namespaces are strange...

```
sage: apps = ['polytope', 'matroid', 'graph', 'group', 'topaz', 'tropical']
sage: for app in apps:
....:     polymake.application(app)
....:     dirs[app] = dir(polymake)
sage: for app1 in apps:
....:     for app2 in apps:
....:         if app1 != app2: print "{:10} {:10} {}".format(app1, app2, len(set(dirs[app1]).difference(dirs[app2])))
....:         
polytope   matroid    0
polytope   graph      345
polytope   group      338
polytope   topaz      278
polytope   tropical   0
matroid    polytope   61
matroid    graph      406
matroid    group      399
matroid    topaz      339
matroid    tropical   0
graph      polytope   0
graph      matroid    0
graph      group      34
graph      topaz      0
graph      tropical   0
group      polytope   0
group      matroid    0
group      graph      41
group      topaz      41
group      tropical   0
topaz      polytope   0
topaz      matroid    0
topaz      graph      67
topaz      group      101
topaz      tropical   0
tropical   polytope   192
tropical   matroid    131
tropical   graph      537
tropical   group      530
tropical   topaz      470
```

- in `application` you should check errors like

```
sage: polymake.application('killerapp')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AssertionError: Unknown Polymake application 'killerapp'
```
  and BTW the above would better be a `ValueError`

Indeed. At least I do not follow another bad practice, which is to put all consoles into the global name space, even though there is the .console() method.

By the way, there is an .interact() method for the thing you want to do.

OK. I think one should keep the string representation of the interface instance upper case (which is consistent with everything but pari/gp).

Thanks, I wasn't aware of that constant.

OK, I'll add: "(but read its SPKG.txt first!)"

Good idea! I asked Andreas about such examples, but he only came up with the thing that I used in the previous versions of the test.

OK

I disagree.

```
sage: m = Magma(command="foobar")
sage: m.console()
/home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/bin/sage-native-execute: 6: /home/king/Sage/git/sage/local/bin/sage-native-execute: magma: not found
```
So, apparently at least one other interface is doing the same thing (it says "magma: not found" where you would expect "foobar: not found").

Andreas created functions that help to get lists of properties, functions and member functions, and also tab completion. These functions will be in future polymake versions.

It would of course be very good if we could backport it, so that it can be used now (without the need to wait for an upgrade of the optional polymake package in Sage).

The approach would be:
- Put Andreas' functions in a script, located in sage/ext_code
- When starting the polymake interface, check whether Andreas' functions are already defined (which means that the user has a new polymake version)
- If they are not defined, read the script into polymake and thus have tab completion more easily.

In the last few commits, I did the following:

- When showing in the tests how to request documentation, I give the whole output as provided by polymake (which should be instructive), but mark the corresponding test as random, as the polymake documentation is of course subject to change in future versions.
- Similar, the member function `get_schedule` yields output that is subject to change. Moreover, `get_schedule` is not something that one normally uses in polymake. So, I was marking some of the corresponding tests "random", and replaced others (in particular those that are visible in the docs) by more realistic use cases ("check whether some point is contained in a polytope").
- Remove a test in which a member of `GROUP` is requested that will soon be gone.

For me (polymake-3.0) tests pass (both `sage -t --optional=sage,polymake` and plain `sage -t`). And for you, Vincent?

I think timeout and eof isn't tested, but everything else *is* tested. But not all options are tested in `_eval_line` (e.g., polymake waiting for user input is tested in `help()`). Anyway I agree it makes sense to test it directly in `_eval_line`.

What would I need to do in order to make it visible in the docs? I think it SHOULD be visible.

I'll also include a test showing how to use a timeout. In fact, I needed a fix in order to make it work.

No, it only works at module level. We are in a crazy transition period where we want to use doctests compatible with both Python2 and Python3. So always write `print(x)` and avoid `print(x,y)`.

There is no such object `sage.interfaces.Interface.interact`.

You need to set the warnings to `"always"` instead of `"once"`

    https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html

I am not sure it is safe to modify this configuration in doctests but it is worth giving a try.

Since the output *after* the warning is random anyway (as it will change with future versions of polymake), I guess it is safe to mark the test as random. We only want to see that the interface doesn't hang and doesn't raise an error.

I added a test showing how to set a timeout (this required a fix).

However, I am not totally happy. While the tests related with timeout and keyboard interrupt mostly (but not always) work, they quite often fail in the doctests. I have no idea why, but I think this can wait for a subsequent ticket, as I believe the interfaces generally works.

Further ideas for the future: Implement pickling.

But for now, I think it is "needs review". The docs seem better, and also I made it clearer what methods are internal and how the interface is supposed to be used.

```

The previous cherry-pick is now empty, possibly due to conflict resolution.
If you wish to commit it anyway, use:

    git commit --allow-empty

Otherwise, please use 'git reset'
interactive rebase in progress; onto 5082c96
Last commands done (7 commands done):

Next commands to do (18 remaining commands):
   pick 69e01f3 Small change to how certain element types are printed
   pick 054123b Extending a method to use 'new' for Polymake classes
You are currently rebasing branch 't/22452/create_a_polymake_pexpect_interface' on '5082c96'.

Great!!!!! Thanks so much for all this work!!! I will let polymake people know and start showing it around!

As a follow up, I guess it would make sense to make a thematic tutorial on the interface?!?! I can volunteer to do it since I was playing a lot with the doc lately. I will continue to bug you with questions when I have them!

Thanks a lot again!

Indeed this is good news! I think it would be appropriate to show *one* example of a computation with polymake inside the thematic tutorial that you started at #22572. It can be a follow up ticket if you do not want to delay it.
