For the record: `.spyx` files are exactly the same as `.pyx` files. So we could even deprecate `.spyx` files if it makes people think that it's something Sage-specific while it's not.

I was mostly right but not 100%: there is one difference between `.spyx` and `.pyx` files: when running a command like

```
$ sage --cython somefile.spyx
```
Sage will add some `.pxi` includes to the Cython sources and set some Sage-specific flags.

Within Sage itself, doing `cython("somefile.spyx")`, there is no difference. When *executing* a Cython file by running `sage somefile.spyx`, there is also no difference.

In my opinion, `sage --cython` should just run plain Cython. Related: #22805

Just reformulating my last comment, I can think of 3 ways to run Cython in a Sage environment:

1. Within Sage, `load("foo.spyx")`: compiles and executes the file

2. `sage foo.spyx`: compiles and executes the file

3. `sage --cython foo.spyx`: only runs Cython on the file

Only 3 makes a difference between `.spyx` and `.pyx` files. I suggest to deprecate this. More precisely, keep the current behaviour but deprecate `sage --cython foo.spyx` (but not `sage --cython foo.pyx` which just runs Cython).
