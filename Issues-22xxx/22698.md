`.spyx` files are treated exactly the same as `.pyx` files in all of Sage, with one exception: `sage --cython foo.spyx` adds pre-processing to `.spyx` files. To be more compatible with other Sage commands (in particular, `sage foo.spyx` and `load("foo.spyx")`), we deprecate `sage --cython foo.spyx`.

There is another reason for this: `sage --cython foo.spyx` adds some `include` statements like `cdefs.pxi`. These `.pxi` files should be deprecated in Sage. Moreover, `.pxi` files in general are semi-deprecated anyway by upstream Cython.

I was mostly right but not 100%: there is one difference between `.spyx` and `.pyx` files: when running a command like

```
$ sage --cython somefile.spyx
```
Sage will add some `.pxi` includes to the Cython sources and set some Sage-specific flags.

Within Sage itself, doing `cython("somefile.spyx")`, there is no difference. When *executing* a Cython file by running `sage somefile.spyx`, there is also no difference.

In my opinion, `sage --cython` should just run plain Cython. Related: #22805

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Just reformulating my last comment, I can think of 3 ways to run Cython in a Sage environment:

1. Within Sage, `load("foo.spyx")`: compiles and executes the file

2. `sage foo.spyx`: compiles and executes the file

3. `sage --cython foo.spyx`: only runs Cython on the file

Only 3 makes a difference between `.spyx` and `.pyx` files. I suggest to deprecate this. More precisely, keep the current behaviour but deprecate `sage --cython foo.spyx` (but not `sage --cython foo.pyx` which just runs Cython).
