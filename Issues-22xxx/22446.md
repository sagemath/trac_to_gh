<a id='comment:3'></a>You run into subtle problems by only defining `__eq__` and not `__ne__`:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: f = x^4 - 17*x^3 - 2*x + 1
sage: A = f.galois_group(pari_group=True)
sage: B = f.galois_group(pari_group=True)
sage: A is B
False
sage: A == B
True
sage: A != B
True
```
This comes from by Python falling back to `__ne__` by `id`.
