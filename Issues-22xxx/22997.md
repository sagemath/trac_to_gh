```
If `integrate(..., algorithm='giac')` does not find a solution, Sage should return an unevaluated expression. 

For example, consider `integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='giac')`.

It returns either

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Giac output: integrate(ln(x)*exp(-x^2),x)
```

or

```
integration(e^(-x^2)*ln(x), x)
```

depending on the user's locale settings (EN and FR respectively). 

OTOH, both Maxima and SymPy return `integrate(e<sup>(-x</sup>2)*log(x), x)`.

Keywords: **integrate, interfaces, giac**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

does it correspond at the level or `giac_integrator` (see `symbolic/integration/external.py`)? or at the level of the giac interface? (see `def _sage_(self, locals={})`).

in the former case, is this correct?

```

if 'integrate' in format(result) or 'integration' in format(result):
    return integrate(expr, v, a, b, hold=True) # ???
else:
    return result._sage_()

Perhaps this exposes a bug in `sympy_integrator`. These work

```
sage: integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='giac')
integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
sage: integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='maxima')
integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
```
although `algorithm='maxima'` was not doctested, but

```
integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x, algorithm='sympy')
```
just hangs.

This really should have depended on #22833 since `src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py` was touched there. I though I had that ticket merged when I tested things here, but apparently not, or else I would have noticed the conflict. #22833 is now in `8.0.beta7` and so this will have to be rebased. Just change it back to `positive_review` when that is done.

Replying to [@strogdon](#comment:9):

my fault, thanks for pointing it out. 

> I though I had that ticket merged when I tested things here, but apparently not, or else I would have noticed the conflict. #22833 is now in `8.0.beta7` and so this will have to be rebased. 

there's something that i don't understand. i do:

```
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git rebase develop
(... solve the merge conflict manually ...)
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git add src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git status
rebase in progress; onto 7a36941
You are currently rebasing branch 't/22997/22997' on '7a36941'.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   src/sage/symbolic/integration/external.py
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git rebase --continue
Applying: parse result in giac_integrator
```

up to now everything seems to work fine, locally. however i try to push to the remote branch and it breaks:

```
(in t/mforets/22997) $ git push trac HEAD:u/mforets/22997
To trac.sagemath.org:sage.git
 ! [rejected]        HEAD -> u/mforets/22997 (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@trac.sagemath.org:sage.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

it also breaks if i use the automatic command:

```
