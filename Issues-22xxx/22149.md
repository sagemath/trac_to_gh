See [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36205/cant-solve-equation-with-abs-in-the-terms/).  Basically, at least in certain situations involving `abs()`, you 

```
var('x y a b')
f=[1+y-a*abs_symbolic(x)==x, b*x==y]; f
solve(f, [x, y])
```
gives boom, or more precisely

```
TypeError: cannot coerce arguments: no canonical coercion from <type 'list'> to Symbolic Ring
```
since it somehow is trying to make this into one object.  But

```
assume(x>0)
solve(f, [x, y])
```
gives not boom.  So somehow our code for recognizing when we have a system of equations isn't working right in the first case.  Note that

```
var('x y a b')
f=[1+y-a*x==x, b*x==y]
solve(f,[x,y]
```
apparently works fine.
