When given a list of elements generating the kernel, `EllipticCurveIsogeny` computes the kernel by first computing the order of each generator. This could be slow since computing the order involves factoring integers. 

Since `EllipticCurveIsogeny` takes the degree of the isogeny as an argument, we can use this to bound the kernel when the degree of the isogeny is known.

Either way you should add a doctest illustrating the speedup, or explain why you do not.
