When given a list of elements generating the kernel, `EllipticCurveIsogeny` computes the kernel by first computing the order of each generator. This could be slow since computing the order involves factoring integers. 

Since `EllipticCurveIsogeny` takes the degree of the isogeny as an argument, we can use this to bound the kernel when the degree of the isogeny is known.

You are trying to avoid computing the group order I think, and I assume that the use case is large finite fields?   I think that a better solution would be to change the order method of points to allow an optional multiple of the order to be passed together with its prime factors. Here the isogeny degree would be passed.  This would be more generally useful.

Either way you should add a doctest illustrating the speedup, or explain why you do not.
