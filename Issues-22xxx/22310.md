Before:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices()).facet_normals()")
5 loops, best of 3: 43.2 ms per loop
```
After:

```
sage: timeit("LatticePolytope(lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3).vertices()).facet_normals()")
125 loops, best of 3: 6.81 ms per loop
```
PPL will of course work for non-full-dimensional polytopes as well, however the treatment of this case is spread around several places and its removal will be treated separately. Once this is done the speed up will be even more significant.

Next in the chain of lattice polytope improvements is #22391

Hey Volker! Looking forward to non-full-dimensional case: many years ago #9188 promised in documentation that

```
        If this polytope is not full-dimensional, facet normals will be
        orthogonal to the integer kernel of the affine subspace spanned by
        this polytope.
```
I can't recall any reason why this orthogonality would be of any importance, can you? Trying to ensure it (unless PPL for some reason guarantees it already) involves a somewhat long chain of matrix manipulations that you eventually got correct and while it is sad to remove it, doing so will definitely simplify the code and likely make it noticeably faster.
