this removes one of our patches, has more vectorisation, and in view of work on #22799 it's better to work with the latest release, to be in sync with numpy devs.

the tarball is [here](https://pypi.python.org/packages/a5/16/8a678404411842fe02d780b5f0a676ff4d79cd58f0f22acddab1b392e230/numpy-1.12.1.zip#md5=c75b072a984028ac746a6a332c209a91) - more precisely it's a zip file.
