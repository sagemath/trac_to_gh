When installing 7.5, I noticed that the file ` sage-7.5/local/share/jupyter/kernels/sagemath/kernel.json ` doesn't have a switch ` --matplotlib=inline `.

Hence I suggest to add it, seems like a nice thing to have by default. I.e. 

```
{"display_name": "SageMath 7.5", "argv": ["$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/sage", "--python", "-m", "sage.repl.ipython_kernel", "--matplotlib=inline", "-f", "{connection_file}"]}
```

with the appropriate version numbers and path, of course
