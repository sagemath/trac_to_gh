Line 394 is part of the definition for the intersection method but it said

```
raise TypeError("only addition of two finite subgroups is defined")
```

This should be changed to

```
raise TypeError("only intersection with a finite subgroup or "
        "modular abelian variety is defined")
```

Seems good, but when you are working with this, can also the note "TODO: Intersection, action of Hecke operators." at the beginning now be removed?
