Line 394 is part of the definition for the intersection method but it said

```
raise TypeError("only addition of two finite subgroups is defined")
```

This should be changed to

```
raise TypeError("only intersection with a finite subgroup or "
        "modular abelian variety is defined")
```

Keywords: intersection modular abelian variety
