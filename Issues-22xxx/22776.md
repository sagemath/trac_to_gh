This was motivated by, but does not solve #22768.

Currently the `spkg-install` for the pythons does a post-install check that some of the compiled extension modules are actually importable.  The problem with this is that it's post-install, so one can still wind up with a partially broken python install.

Unfortunately, there's no good way (without patching, at least) for Python's build to exit if one of the extension modules (which are ostensibly optional) fails to build.  So this patch just scans the build output for the magic string "Failed to build these modules:" and treats the build as failed if found.

This still might not be fool-proof (an extension module might somehow compile but still not be working), so this keeps the post-install checks as well.  But this will at least catch more issues in build, before install.
