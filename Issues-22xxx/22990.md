The following example loops forever

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(2)
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(0,1)
```
and this one raises an error

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(2)
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(1,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LookupError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

LookupError: Vertex (1) is not a vertex of the graph.

<a id='comment:2'></a>This looks good, but there is one inconsistency with other path functions in the corner case where the source and destination are the same.  'all_paths' allows for a length-0 path while 'vertex_disjoint_paths' does not.

```
sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,'a'), (1,2,'b')])
sage: D.all_paths(0,0)
[[0]]
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(0,0)
[]
```
Of course Menger's theorem does not apply here because a vertex cut has to be between two distinct vertices, but since [0] is a path it would make some sense to allow it as a vertex-disjoint path here.

For me this is not consistent.

<a id='comment:4'></a>I don't see the inconsistency there.

There are other places in Sage where 0-length paths are more consistent with the documentation.  For example, for G.distance we have "Returns the (directed) distance from u to v in the (di)graph, i.e.
the length of the shortest path from u to v.", and G.distance(0,0) returns 0.  Similarly, G.shortest_path(0,0) returns 0 and the documentation says it will return a path from u to v.  And G.shortest_paths(0) includes the length-0 path from 0 to itself.

It is certainly true that not all authors (of Graph Theory books) allow 0-length paths, but if you want to ban them there are several functions that need to be changed.

That all said, this small inconsistency is not a show-stopper if you do not want to change it, but I always like to see the edge cases handled properly.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Other path functions are clearly inconsistent and must be quickly patched:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge(10,11)
sage: G.has_edge(10,11)
True
sage: 0 in G
False
sage: G.shortest_path(0,0)
[0]
sage: G.shortest_path_length(0,0)
0
sage: G.distance(0,0)
0
sage: G.all_paths(0,0)
[[0]]
```
So I believe the behavior I propose for this method is the correct one.

I still think it would be slightly better for you to allow for 0-length paths, but don't see it as worth fighting over.  Everything else in the commit looks fine, so I'll give it a positive review.
