The following example loops forever

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(2)
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(0,1)
```
and this one raises an error

```
sage: D = digraphs.Path(2)
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(1,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
LookupError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

This looks good, but there is one inconsistency with other path functions in the corner case where the source and destination are the same.  'all_paths' allows for a length-0 path while 'vertex_disjoint_paths' does not.

```
sage: D = DiGraph([(0,1,'a'), (1,2,'b')])
sage: D.all_paths(0,0)
[[0]]
sage: D.vertex_disjoint_paths(0,0)
[]
```
Of course Menger's theorem does not apply here because a vertex cut has to be between two distinct vertices, but since [0] is a path it would make some sense to allow it as a vertex-disjoint path here.

Actually I would do the opposite and avoid returning 0-length path in `all_paths`.

For me this is not consistent.

```

sage: G.all_paths(0,1)
[[0, 1], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 3, 1], [0, 3, 1], [0, 3, 2, 1]]

I don't see the inconsistency there.

There are other places in Sage where 0-length paths are more consistent with the documentation.  For example, for G.distance we have "Returns the (directed) distance from u to v in the (di)graph, i.e.
the length of the shortest path from u to v.", and G.distance(0,0) returns 0.  Similarly, G.shortest_path(0,0) returns 0 and the documentation says it will return a path from u to v.  And G.shortest_paths(0) includes the length-0 path from 0 to itself.

It is certainly true that not all authors (of Graph Theory books) allow 0-length paths, but if you want to ban them there are several functions that need to be changed.

That all said, this small inconsistency is not a show-stopper if you do not want to change it, but I always like to see the edge cases handled properly.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

Other path functions are clearly inconsistent and must be quickly patched:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge(10,11)
sage: G.has_edge(10,11)
True
sage: 0 in G
False
sage: G.shortest_path(0,0)
[0]
sage: G.shortest_path_length(0,0)
0
sage: G.distance(0,0)
0
sage: G.all_paths(0,0)
[[0]]
```
So I believe the behavior I propose for this method is the correct one.

Well, I agree that these other functions ought to be fixed; it seems clear that the vertices in a path need to be actual vertices of the graph!  Perhaps I will open a ticket for that.

I still think it would be slightly better for you to allow for 0-length paths, but don't see it as worth fighting over.  Everything else in the commit looks fine, so I'll give it a positive review.
