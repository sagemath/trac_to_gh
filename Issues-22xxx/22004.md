I want this to work:

```
sage: n = var('n')
sage: sum(1/((2*n+1)^2-4)^2, n, 0, Infinity, algorithm='sympy')

Also,

```
         sage: symbolic_sum(1/(1+k^2), k, -oo, oo, algorithm = 'giac')           # optional - giac
         (pi*e^(2*pi) - pi*e^(-2*pi))/(e^(2*pi) + e^(-2*pi) - 2)

```

You will need an extra blank line for formatting.  I'd also say that Maxima can't do the sum in this ticket, not that Sage per se can't - indeed, Sage can after this patch!
