<a id='comment:6'></a>Let me summarize the problem:

```
sage: x = var('x')
sage: X.<a> = Qq(27, modulus = x^3 + 2*x + 1)
sage: P.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: R.<a> = Qq(27, modulus = x^3 + 2*x + 1)
sage: X == R
False
sage: X._cmp_(R)
1
sage: X.__richcmp__(R, 2)
True
```
So the default behavior for `==` is apparently to call `_cmp_` in `Parent` which calls `__cmp__`. Therefore one may have to change the behaviour in Parent to first call `__richcmp__` before being able to handle this.
