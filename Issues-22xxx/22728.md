So we could consider just patching Cython in Sage in order to move forward with #20238.

If you need the Sage patched version of Cython to install cypari it is not really independent of Sage...

True, but that's still better than just keeping #20238 blocked.

To be specific: that patch is needed whenever some package (Sage in this case) wants to use the *Cython* interface of `CyPari2`. So you are right that CyPari2 by itself does not need that patch.
