So we could consider just patching Cython in Sage in order to move forward with #20238.

If you need the Sage patched version of Cython to install cypari it is not really independent of Sage...

IIUC Cypari will still install/work without this patch *in principle*--this is just needed for some specific use cases in integration with Sage.  If it were really needed for cypari to work independently of Sage at the worst cypari could monkey-patch Cython.  But considering that this patch is, as far as I can tell, pretty non-controversial and obvious, and is likely to be accepted upstream, I see no problem adding it in Sage as well at least for the sake of progressing on #20238.

To be specific: that patch is needed whenever some package (Sage in this case) wants to use the *Cython* interface of `CyPari2`. So you are right that CyPari2 by itself does not need that patch.
