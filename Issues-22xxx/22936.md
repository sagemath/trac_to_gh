Computing the Newton polygon of a polynomial with coefficients in a ring of power series fails if the coefficients have infinite precision:

```python
sage: S.<x> = PowerSeriesRing(GF(5))
sage: R.<y> = S[]
sage: p = x^2+y+x*y^2
sage: p.newton_polygon()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
IndexError: list index out of range
```

I attach a small patch fixing this issue.
I've also updated the method `_factor_of_degree` in order to make the slope factorization work correctly. (Otherwise, at infinite precision, it may never stop.)
