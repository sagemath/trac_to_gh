}
```
With my configuration, the configure script of polymake 3.0 is not working, probably due to a new version of perl:

```
$ ./configure 
checking C++ compiler ... ok (g++ is GCC 6.3.0)
checking C++ library ... ok (GNU stdlibc++ 20170218, C++ 201402)
determining architecture ... Undefined subroutine &Polymake::Configure::platform_name called at support/configure.pl line 538.
```

Let's package the latest version of polymake, 3.1. 


To build it for Sage do:

- pull this ticket
- download from â€‹[https://polymake.org/lib/exe/fetch.php/download/polymake-3.1-minimal.tar.bz2](https://polymake.org/lib/exe/fetch.php/download/polymake-3.1-minimal.tar.bz2)
- put it in `$SAGE_ROOT/upstream/`
- `sage -i polymake`

Depends on #22606
