I know this goes close to the bikeshed, but I like the conciseness of:

```diff
-        if op == Py_NE:
-            return True
-        else:
-            return False
+        return op == Py_NE
```
Also dabbling in possible premature optimization, I also think we should move the `is` check to be the first thing as that is faster than the `isinstance` and more likely to be true.
