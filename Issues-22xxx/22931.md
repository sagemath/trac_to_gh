This will enable crosslinking them from other reST+Sphinx documents, inside and outside Sage's documentation, including https://readthedocs.org/projects/more-sagemath-thematic-tutorials/

Questions:
- prefix labels with their document? E.g. `prep-programming` rather than `programming`
- Change the title of the ref manual to "Reference Manual" rather than "Content" to get a nicer title in cross-references?
- Can we link from the thematic tutorials to the prep tutorials?

My opinions:

Replying to [ticket:22931 nthiery]:
> Questions:
> - prefix labels with their document? E.g. `prep-programming` rather than `programming`


Sure, sounds good.

> - Change the title of the ref manual to "Reference Manual" rather than "Content" to get a nicer title in cross-references?


Yes.

> - Can we link from the thematic tutorials to the prep tutorials?


If we can, we should.

In addition to the changes here, it would be nice to see some crosslinkings among the documents, if for no other reason than to illustrate how they work.

Replying to [jhpalmieri](#comment%3A6):
> Sure, sounds good.
> Yes.


Done.

> If we can, we should.


Agreed. Digging a bit more in, I believe we can't at this stage. Too bad.

> In addition to the changes here, it would be nice to see some crosslinkings among the documents, if for no other reason than to illustrate how they work.


I added one for illustration purpose. Adding many would be very nice indeed, but I'd say it's for a (or several) follow-up ticket(s).

Thanks John for looking at this!
