Now that #22389 *(Make Three.js work offline)* and #22261 *(Three.js: Default lighting)*
have been merged, it is time to make threejs the default 3d viewer, in replacement of jmol.

A discussion about this started in #22389. In addition, one may note the following:

**pros**: 

- three.js offers functionality absent in Jmol, notably axis labels
- three.js works better with Jupyter than Jmol, see e.g. [this report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/KvNuD2DfRz0/VM1BPPDPCAAJ))
- Jmol is a nightmare for packagers (for Debian, Windows, ...), see e.g. [this discussion on debian-science-sagemath](https://alioth-lists.debian.net/pipermail/debian-science-sagemath/2018-July/001228.html); in particular jsmol, which is invoked in Jupyter notebooks, is not packaged for Debian (see[comment:49](#comment%3A49))
- Jmol, as currently shipped with Sage, is broken with recent version of Java runtime environment, e.g. on Debian Buster and Ubuntu 18.04, see this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47837/jmol-stuck-at-initializing-3d-display/)

**cons**:

- some features are still missing in three.js, like 
  - converting the view to a png image in *non-interactive* mode (e.g. when generating the reference manual, cf.[comment:66](#comment%3A66)); NB: thanks to #27910 (merged in Sage 8.8.rc0), the png conversion is now possible in *interactive* mode; see [this discussion](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27910#comment:6)
  - ~~mesh plots~~ ==> fixed by #28343 (merged in Sage 8.9.beta8)
  - ~~vector field plots~~ ==> fixed by #27932 (merged in Sage 8.9.beta0)
- three.js has some issues:
  - ~~faces of polytopes look rounded~~ ==> fixed by #27836 (merged in Sage 8.8.beta7)
  - some opacity issues: cf.[comment:75](#comment%3A75) and below

For future reference, this simple alteration is all that is needed to change the default, but no rush about it. After #22389 the viewer does not work locally in notebooks: must fix!

Looking at the source code, it does seem indeed that `Graphics3d._save_image_png` does not support threejs output. Either the docbuild needs to use jmol by default, or threejs could be made to save png output.

(In Debian we explicitly fail the build if the dochtml.log contains "Error". We have to do this because the builder doesn't fail by itself. At this point I'm not sure if this is a Sage bug that also needs to be filed separately, because we patch the Sage dochtml build quite heavily to avoid segfaults and OOM, and I'm unsure if this interferes with any fail-on-error semantics that should be in there.)

Perhaps a corner case and perhaps not important but if I from a local machine (A) ssh (ssh -Y) to remote machine (B) where Sage is installed and then try to display graphics stuff (`show(sphere(), viewer='threejs'`) on the display for local machine (A); say from `sagenb`, then the `threejs` viewer fails. In the JS console I see

```
THREE.WebGLRenderer 80
THREE.WebGLRenderer: Error creating WebGL context.
```
and nothing is displayed. Nothing is similarly displayed from the command line or `jupyter` notebook. The `jmol` viewer does work. Of course, one could always install Sage on the local machine (A) and get things to work.

Is there no other math library in JS?  Seems like a lot of work to do correctly.

Yes I understand this. Printing output is a minor feature as compared with interactive display in the browser, but it seems required in at least two cases:

- to illustrate the documentation, like in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html (although maybe we could investigate if sphinx could deal with Three.js/WebGL)
- to produce static figures for publications.

There is one library with complex-valued special functions called [Jmat](https://github.com/lvandeve/jmat), but it has an explicit caveat as to the accuracy of the code. It is also undocumented and not actively developed. The only other library I know that comes close is a [transpilation](https://github.com/scijs/gsl-sf) of the GNU scientific library, but that does not support complex numbers and transpiling produces bloated code. One would expect [Math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs) to include special functions, but it only has the gamma and error functions, which are the simplest to implement.

Besides, one may note that 3D plots in the documentation do not have to be static: an example of (interactive) three.js rendering is at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plot3d/threejs.html
So, as soon as threejs becomes the default, we could use those (except probably for pdf documentation).

> some features are still missing in three.js


For what it is worth, I think the version in Sage worksheets in CoCalc has all of these things that are missing...  https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/blob/master/src/smc-webapp/sagews/3d.coffee

To try it, open a cocalc Sage worksheet, then show 3d plots, but don't do (viewer='threejs'), since that will actually break it in Sage worksheets. E.g., just do

```
dodecahedron(mesh=2, color='green', opacity=.7)
```

When the mouse moves outside any plot it is replaced by a static png image.  This is absolutely CRITICAL since otherwise if there are more than about 10 plots on the page, things break in subtle ways (at least that was the case when I developed this).  If Jupyter Sage doesn't do this, then that's a problem.

To see that printing works, click any of the print buttons in the top right.  It even should work with print to pdf, which grabs those png's mentioned above, sends them to the backend project, and embeds them in the latex document...

Scratch that, I'm getting the same thing now too.  Previously I was running Sage 8.3.  So actually maybe something changed between Sage versions.

Update: Okay, really weird.  I recently uninstalled and reinstalled Sage 8.3 on Windows (since I was testing a new version of the installer) and *now* my 8.3 has the same problem, whereas previously it did not.  How strange.

I wish I still had my previous example open but it appears not.

The first of them means that 

```
sage: g = sphere()
sage: g.save("sphere.png")
```
produces a png file depicting the Jmol initial view, while we have at the moment

```
sage: g = sphere(viewer='threejs')
sage: g  # OK: opens a threejs window in the browser
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: g.save("sphere.png")
...
ValueError: cannot use viewer=threejs to render image

I am still trying to find a solution for the issue mentioned in this ticket of rendering polyhedrons.  As I mentioned in[comment:42](#comment%3A42) the solution from the ThreeJS perspective is easy.

It would suffice to make the following change to the code of `sphinx_plot`, in line 75 of `src/sage/docs/conf.py`:

```diff
-     graphics.save(fn)
+     graphics.save(fn, viewer='jmol')
```
to have all the documentation generated with Jmol, as it is currently. Of course the drawback is that the figures in the documentation will have an aspect different from what the user will get with threejs as the default. But maybe this is something we can live on at the moment...

sage: P1=plot3d(lambda x,y:x^2+y^2,(-2,2),(-2,2), color="blue", opacity=0.5)
sage: P2=plot3d(lambda x,y:1,(-2,2),(-2,2), color="yellow", opacity=0.5)
sage: show(P1+P2, viewer="threejs")
Launched html viewer for Graphics3d Object
```

Now, in the browser window, try to change your point of view to look at the object from a little above the `z==1` plane: the "lower" part of the paraboloid diseappears if no point of it can be "viewed directly". It should be seen "through the plane" (in a greenish shade...).

There are also points of view where the "directly visible" part of the paraboloid is visible but the part "hidden" by the plane is not see "through the plane" as it should.

Last, "rotating" the object exhibits moiré effects at some points of the movement.

... sorry to interrupt the discussion.

I am very much looking forward to the improvements of this ticket!

I have one small issue concerning polytopes (which is a feature that apparently a lot of people use, I receive a lot of feedback):

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/geometry/polytope_tikz.html

I would be happy to migrate this tutorial to the then default viewer (especially for people where jmol would not work). Since I do not know `threejs` that much I was wondering if there is an equivalent way to figure out the "angle of view data" used in the tutorial. Namely:

In jmol's console, if one clicks "State", one gets a list of three numbers next to `moveto` followed by an angle of rotation between 0 and 360. These 4 numbers essentially describe the 3D-2D projection.

Is there a (fairly) easy way to get this in `threejs`?

The underlying information is available from the position of the camera relative to the midpoint of the scene. The question is how to make it easily accessible, since the Three.js `OrbitControls` use the mouse right click to pan the scene. Open possibility would be to add an additional icon like I did for downloading an image of the scene.

`dimpase`'s answer is relevant...

> The question is whether transparency is more important than packaging issues. Besides,  Jmol will remain available as a viewer option.


Another (admittedly caricatural) example where the "transparency problem" clobbers the mathematical usefulness of the plot :

```
sage: P1=implicit_plot3d(E1.lhs().subs([a==2]),(x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), (z, -2, 2)
....: , color="blue", opacity=0.5)
sage: P2=implicit_plot3d(E2.lhs().subs([b==1]),(x, -2, 2), (y, -2, 2), (z, -2, 2)
....: , color="yellow", opacity=0.5)
sage: (P1.P2).show(viewer="threejs")
```

The part of the yellow cone inner to the sphere isn't visualized at all...

!^ This.  Different viewers will all have different issues, and fixing every known bug with ThreeJS (which is a problem beyond Sage since it involves browsers, WebGL libraries, operating systems, etc.) is not a viable blocker to making this change or it will never happen.

The ThreeJS viewer works for the most common cases, and most importantly for cases that are likely to arise in tutorials for new users, etc.  For more niche applications, other viewers will still be available as alternatives until/unless the issue can be resolved with ThreeJS.

I mostly agree with you both : in their current respective states, `threejs` is probably a more useful //default// than `jmol` (unless sudden progress on #25026 and related tickets miraculously happens...) . However :

> Probably there should be a poll on sage-devel.


Seconded. Since it probably is already too late for 8.9 (which is at the "rc" stage), and since a doc-building test must be undertaken, this pool could proceed as soon as this tests well.

Other valuable suggestions have been made, such as the addition of some widget allowing to get the current view parameters, etc. (and I may have a couple, if I can take the time to *think about them...). Unless they are trivial, they probably would deserve ticket(s) of their own, less urgent than the proposed change of default.

Here is a first version of the complete code for making threejs the default viewer. With respect to the code in previous branch (which was only changing the `'viewer'` value in the dict `SHOW_DEFAULTS`), this code makes `viewer=None` equivalent to `viewer='threejs'` and updates the documentation to reflect the change of the default viewer. 

NB: for generating the reference manual, instead of the solution proposed in[comment:66](#comment%3A66), I've made the method `Graphics3d._save_image_png` fall back on jmol if the viewer is threejs.  

I've checked that both the html and pdf documentation are generated without any error (with png figures produced by jmol though...) and I am setting the ticket to 'needs review' to draw the attention of the patchbots.
