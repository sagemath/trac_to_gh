Replying to [@fchapoton](#comment%3A35):

this is perfectly reproducible on FreeBSD 11.0 with clang 3.8, as described in #22679
FreeBSD 11 is some kind of approximation of OSX.

I took the current branch there and merged your `u/chapoton/22257v4`.

And, just in case, that's what I have at the prompt with this branch applied:

```
sage: bool(pi-pi == 0)
True
sage: bool(pi-pi < 0)
False
sage: bool(pi-pi > 0)
False
sage: pi<pi
pi < pi
sage: bool(pi<pi)
True
sage: bool(pi==pi)
True
sage: bool(pi>pi)
True
sage: bool(pi<4)

```
from the point of view of numerical analysis, this all makes sense.
One cannot reliably compare floating point numbers for equality, and `pi` is just
a floating point number in disguise. So you compare two "equal" floating point numbers for equality, this won't fly...

But the following seems to make sense:

```
sage: bool(pi-pi == 0)
True
sage: bool(pi-pi < 0)
False
sage: bool(pi-pi > 0)
False
```
(what happens is I suppose that pi-pi gets properly simplified to 0...)

ok, so the problem is here:

```
sage: bool(pi>pi)
True
```
which is not the normal behaviour. I get `False` with the same branch.

One possible solution (not solving the real issue) would be to replace the test ̀`lower > upper` by `lower - upper > 0`.

I wonder why `pi` is not of type `sage.symbolic.constants_c.E`, while `e` is.
The latter explains why these comparison tests work.

With `pi` vs `sqrt(2)`, apparently simplification works better with algebraic numbers than with transcendentals.

OK, `u/chapoton/22257v6` passes the long tests in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`.
And the following also looks sane:

```
sage: pi<pi
pi < pi
sage: bool(pi<pi)
False
sage: bool(pi>pi)
False
sage: bool(pi==pi)
True
```

Green bot on linux and should be ok also on macosx.

The only change compared to the previously "positive-reviewed" branch is the removal of the method `__lt__` in the class `Constant` inside the file `constants.py`. Some doctests have also been added in expressions.pyx.

This means that comparison with pi and similar constants will be handled (in a better way) by the general comparison of expressions.

Once again, this is currently the point where python3 compilation fails. And this is needed to go forward, with next step being 22297.

Please review!
