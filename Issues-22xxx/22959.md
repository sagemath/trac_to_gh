In the current `8.0.beta5` I get the following:

```
sage: f = x/(1-x^2)
sage: f.series(x==0, 10)
1*x^2 + 1*x^4 + 1*x^6 + 1*x^8 + Order(x^10)
sage: f.series(x==0, 11)
1*x + 1*x^3 + 1*x^5 + 1*x^7 + 1*x^9 + Order(x^11)
```

This seems to be a regression from somewhere between `sage-7.5` (where the result is still correct) and `sage-7.6`.

Usually I'd do that, thanks. :-)

However, I'm at a conference and have a very unstable internet connection, so I don't want to build the latest beta on my laptop. And as of a rather unlucky coincidence, my VPN connection to our university servers does not work either, so I also can't start the patchbot we have there.
