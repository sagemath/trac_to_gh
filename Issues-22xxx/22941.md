<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

We need to fix `repr(vars()['notebook'])` (surprise, surprise...) by some kind of "guarding" it, or perhaps by removing it from global namespace...


Indeed, try running the following:

```
sage: v=vars()
sage: f=open('/dev/null','w')
sage: for k in v.keys():
....:     if k!='v':   # to avoid recursion
....:         f.write(repr(v[k]))
....:         if 'NB' in str(get_display_manager()):
....:            print("Achtung!!! "+str(k))
....:            break
```
You will get some deprecation warnings and then

```
...
Achtung!!! notebook
```
So swithcing to SageNB backend is triggered by `repr(vars()['notebook'])`.

Indeed

```
sage: get_display_manager()
The Sage display manager using the IPython command line backend
sage: vars()['notebook']
<sagenb.notebook.notebook_object.NotebookObject instance at 0x7fe63d83ae18>
<sagenb.notebook.notebook_object.NotebookObject instance at 0x7fe63d83ae18>
sage: get_display_manager()
The Sage display manager using the SageNB backend
The Sage display manager using the SageNB backend
```

(doubling of lines is caused by unsuitability of SageNB backend for the terminal.)

Actually, both Volker's and my suggestion fix `vars()['notebook']`, but they don't fix the problem in general:

```
sage: notebook?
...
sage: get_display_manager()
The Sage display manager using the IPython command line backend
sage: vars()['notebook']
<sagenb.notebook.notebook_object.NotebookObject instance at 0x1bc7f57e8>
sage: get_display_manager()
The Sage display manager using the IPython command line backend
sage: vars()
...
sage: get_display_manager()
The Sage display manager using the SageNB backend
The Sage display manager using the SageNB backend
```
