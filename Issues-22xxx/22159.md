<a id='comment:15'></a>On fedora 25 where my system libpng is 1.6.27 I was able to built giac with your libpng 1.6.28.

On a debian system with libpng12 installed I was able to reproduce the above error.

But cd in src/src/.libs and edit libgiac.la with -lpng16 instead of -lpng and I was able to end the built.

Does it worth a patch (do you have a similar pb elsewhere?) or should I ask parisse if it is possible to add a --disable-png in configure?

I would be +1 for the patch as well, since i need to compile giac with png and fltk support for [Sage Debian Live](https://sagedebianlive.metelu.net/), since i provide xcas through Sage. So, if it is possible, it is better to fix the issue than to skip it.

The problem occurs when you have a libpng12 system wide installed and sage libpng1.6. If you built giac with the system wide libpng12 then I guess  that you will have the same error as in comment 10.
Are you using 2 libpng in sage debian live?
Now if you built giac with -lpng16 instead of -lpng I don't know if it will work with your fltk because I guess it is linked to the system libpng12?

Indeed: `apt-rdepends libfltk1.3-dev | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9]' | grep png` leads to `libpng12-0` Fortunately, the next Debian stable will ship libpng16.

NB: giac/xcas has now an official package in debian unstable:

https://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/giac

so in next releases you may not need the spkg for xcas.

Actually, i wonder whether giac from Sage could produce png with libpng16 (shipped with Sage once this ticket gets merged) and the xcas GUI could be displayed with fltk using system's libpng12 without any conflict. I will try such an option anyway (also, `libfltk1.3-dev` has no dependency on `libpng12-dev` so that i can remove it during giac compilation, so there should not be any problem there).

sorry for noise, that was FreeBSD-specific leftover from an old port that caused this.
No problem, in fact.

Sure.

Well, the issue is *avoided* in #22101 (which disables png support), but i think we should not consider this as a permanent solution, and provide a full-featured giac (which can draw pictures).
