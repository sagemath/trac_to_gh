On fedora 25 where my system libpng is 1.6.27 I was able to built giac with your libpng 1.6.28.

On a debian system with libpng12 installed I was able to reproduce the above error.

But cd in src/src/.libs and edit libgiac.la with -lpng16 instead of -lpng and I was able to end the built.

Does it worth a patch (do you have a similar pb elsewhere?) or should I ask parisse if it is possible to add a --disable-png in configure?

The problem occurs when you have a libpng12 system wide installed and sage libpng1.6. If you built giac with the system wide libpng12 then I guess  that you will have the same error as in comment 10.
Are you using 2 libpng in sage debian live?
Now if you built giac with -lpng16 instead of -lpng I don't know if it will work with your fltk because I guess it is linked to the system libpng12?

Indeed: `apt-rdepends libfltk1.3-dev | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9]' | grep png` leads to `libpng12-0` Fortunately, the next Debian stable will ship libpng16.

NB: giac/xcas has now an official package in debian unstable:

https://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/giac

so in next releases you may not need the spkg for xcas.

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment:26):
> Can we try to merge it in 8.0?
