this patch is broken:

```
sage: A = random_matrix(RDF, 2)
sage: A

[-0.9428173549065391  -0.301642050267529]
[ 0.6212822063471177 -0.9690284523509545]
sage: A^x
...
AttributeError: 'sage.matrix.matrix_real_double_dense.Matrix_real_double_dense' object has no attribute '_matrix_power_symbolic'
```

just adding the new `_matrix_power_symbolic` and updating the generic ` __pow__` doesn't seem to be correct. some hints?

Some quick comments:

- Use `Jk[i,i]` instead of `Jk[i][i]` as the latter creates a temporary `vector` object. However, I would do

  ```python
            Jk_ii = Jk[i,i]
            if hasattr(Jk_ii, 'radical_expression'):
                Jk_ii = Jk_ii.radical_expression()
  ```
- Use <code>\`</code> instead of `$` for latex formatting in docstrings.
- In the `INPUT:` block: <code>- \`\`A\`\` -- a square matrix over an exact field</code> Note the removal of the period too.
- Make `A` and `A^n` in latex.
- Is there some reason why the function is not a `cdef` function?
- I don't understand why you try to change the base ring to `QQbar`. Could you justify this?
- This seems strange: `vector(SR, i).list()`. Why not `[SR.zero()]*i`?
- I would use a call to `binomial` instead of `(factorial_n/(factorial(n-i)*factorial(i))` because it probably requires less operations when `n` is big. Perhaps some testing is needed here.
- How many of those imports are needed in the function? Having them there slows the function down.
- I'm not completely sure about creating the blank (dense) matrix and then filling it in afterwards. I feel like a better solution would be to just construct the data for the matrix and then construct the matrix from that (if this is even needed).

@tscrim : thanks for the feedback, i've tried to correct the formatting issues.

some testing for the algorithm before changes (before 32e7cf9):

Test in the rationals, two-dimensional:

```
    sage: k = var('k')
    sage: A = matrix(QQ, 2, [1/2, -1, 2, 0])
    sage: timeit('A^k')
    5 loops, best of 3: 105 ms per loop
```

Test of the [stochastic matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix) in wikipedia:

```
    sage: A = matrix([[0, 0, 1/2, 0, 1/2], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1/4, 1/4, 0, 1/4, 1/4], [0, 0, 1/2, 0, 1/2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]])
    sage: timeit('A^k')
    5 loops, best of 3: 192 ms per loop
```

Test in the symbolic ring:

```
    sage: n = var('n')
    sage: A = matrix([[pi, e],[0, -2*I]])
    sage: timeit('A^n')
    25 loops, best of 3: 26 ms per loop
```

here are some partial answers:

> - Use `Jk[i,i]` instead of `Jk[i][i]` as the latter creates a temporary `vector` object. However, I would do
> 
>   ```python
>             Jk_ii = Jk[i,i]

>   ```


yes, it is better that way. it didn't have an impact in the timing of my quick examples above, though (+- 10ms)

> - I don't understand why you try to change the base ring to `QQbar`. Could you justify this?


this is to cover the cases where the eigenvalues do not belong to the same ring as the given matrix. in general the `jordan_form` method breaks with the message `RuntimeError: Some eigenvalue does not exist in Rational Field.` 

For example consider taking the jordan form of `A = matrix(2, [1, 2, 1, -2])`. 

On the other hand, the example `A = matrix([[pi, e],[0, -2*I]])` tests the case when it is not possible to transform to QQbar (it would break with ``TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number``). 

> - This seems strange: `vector(SR, i).list()`. Why not `[SR.zero()]*i`?


sure, i'm used to thinking in matrices/vectors in the 1st place, rather than lists :) 

done in the new commit, for the record it didn't have an impact on timeit for the 3 examples above (+- 5..10ms)

> - I would use a call to `binomial` instead of `(factorial_n/(factorial(n-i)*factorial(i))` because it probably requires less operations when `n` is big. Perhaps some testing is needed here.


right, at least with the binomial method the code is more clear.

more generally, i'm not confident that jordanization will be useful at all for 
'big' n, since this operation is very costly. however if the matrix is very sparse then maybe it works, i didn't try any of that.

> - How many of those imports are needed in the function? Having them there slows the function down.


well yes, i was able to get rid of importing vector, based on the suggestion of above.

i tried `def` -> `cdef` in the function's definition, but this breaks many things (compilation). where can i learn more about using cdef in Sage library code? thanks

hmm i would normally use the same matrix to store partial computations (instead of creating a new one, say). are you suggesting that it's preferable to do differently like what, use lists? 

in this particular case, there are `FJ_k.set_row(i, Jk_row_i)` and `FJ.set_block(k, k, FJ_k)` inside a loop. yes, the matrix `FJ` is needed afterwards to do the computation `P * FJ * Pinv`.

However, `FJ_k` is not. I would just like to modify `FJ` since the intermediate matrix `FJ_k` doesn't really need to be there.
