The new implementation is much faster. In addition, we add parameter `labels` allowing to return bridges without edge labels.

Before

```
sage: g = 2*graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.add_edge(1,10)
sage: g.bridges()
[(1, 10, None)]
sage: %timeit G.bridges()
1000 loops, best of 3: 310 µs per loop
```
After

```
sage: %timeit G.bridges()
1000 loops, best of 3: 198 µs per loop
```
