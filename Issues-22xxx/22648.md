<a id='comment:1'></a>What should be the names for these functions?

4 is called *congruence normal*, 2 and 3 as *lower bounded* and *upper bounded* and 1 as *bounded*. But we can't add `is_bounded()` with different meaning to lattices that we already have for posets.

(See for example http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf.)

For case 1 only? Could be, got to think about this.

We now have `is_orthocomplemented()` (by me) with optional parameter `unique`. What you think about that, and having something like `is_doubling_constructable()` with mandratory string parameter having possible values `'convex', 'intevar'` etc?

Duh. We already have `is_uniform` after #21861.

Page 3 says this more directly "congruence-uniform lattice is any lattice constructable by a sequence of interval doubings."

<a id='comment:8'></a>Certificate should be possible.

First see a term 'inflation' in http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf and also figure 3 at page 8. Maybe doubling construction should be expanded to municipal subsets?

But I can't be sure when I will look at this, and so I mark this as wishlist queue.

I think it should be something like this:

```
def antidouble(self):
    ji = self.join_irreducibles()
    mi = self.meet_irreducibles()

    h = {}
    i = 0
    for l in self.level_sets():
        for e in l:
            h[e] = i
        i += 1

    for a in ji:
        a_ = self.lower_covers(a)[0]
        for b in mi:
            if self.compare_elements(a, b) is not None:
                continue
            b_ = self.upper_covers(b)[0]
            if h[b]-h[a_] == h[b_]-h[a]:
                A = self.interval(a_, b)
                B = self.interval(a, b_)
                if len(A) == len(B):
                    if self.subposet(A).is_isomorphic(self.subposet(B)):
                        if LatticePoset(self.subposet([e for e in self if e not in B])).day_doubling(A).is_isomorphic(self):
                            print((a_, b), (a, b_))
```

but of course is much faster to work directly with Hasse Diagram. Having temporary posets is bad, as they eat memory that is not released until you restart the whole worksheet.

There must be a small bug however, because

```
antidouble(posets.PentagonPoset())
```
should print a collapsible interval (the middle relation in the longer chain), but doesn't.

In case I find out, I'll let you know!

The congurence lattice of a lattice is always distributive. A distributive lattice L has `|Ji(L)| = |Mi(L)|`. Hence a lattice `L` can be (totally) bounded only if it has `|Ji(L)| = |Mi(L)|`. That can be used as a fast check to reject lattices that clearly can't be (totallyt) bounded.

And of course `Posets.DiamondPoset(5)` shows that the last "if" is not "iff".

But I must continue to think and code. For me they are almost the same thing.

Thanks for the review.

OEIS is missing most of series related to lattice enumeration. I have added some, see for example https://oeis.org/A261994. Here is code if you want to add more:

```
N = 8
LL = []
for i in range(N-2):
    x = []
    for P in Posets(i):
        try:
            x.append(LatticePoset(P.with_bounds()))
        except ValueError:
            pass
    LL.append(x)

functions = ['is_planar', 'is_upper_semimodular']

for f in functions:
    print(f)
    for i in range(2, N):
        print(i, len([L for L in LL[i-2] if attrcall(f)(L)]))
```

Duh. Added.

Btw, this can be optimized much more. First, we don't need to count all `Ji(Con L)`, as if we found `a, b \in Ji(L)` such that `Cong(a, a_) == Cong(b, b_)`, where `e_` is the only element covered by `e`, we can't have `|Ji(Con L)|` as big as `|Ji(L)|`.

Next, a congruence generated by "antidoubling" can only have blocks of one or two element. Hence we can stop when we found even one `e` such that `Cong(e, e_)` has at least one congruence block of three or more elements.
