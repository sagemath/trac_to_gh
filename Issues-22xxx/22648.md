What should be the names for these functions?

4 is called *congruence normal*, 2 and 3 as *lower bounded* and *upper bounded* and 1 as *bounded*. But we can't add `is_bounded()` with different meaning to lattices that we already have for posets.

(See for example http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf.)

Some people (at least McConville https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05213) use `congruence_uniform` instead of bounded, I think:

5.2 Congruence-normal and congruence-uniform lattices

A finite lattice L is congruence-normal if there exists a
sequence of lattices L_1,..., L_l such that L_1 is the one-element lattice, L_l = L, and for
all i, there exists an order convex subset C_i of L_i such that L_{i+1} = L_i[Ci].

A lattice is congruence-uniform if it is both congruence-normal and semidistributive.

Duh. We already have `is_uniform` after #21861.

Page 3 says this more directly "congruence-uniform lattice is any lattice constructable by a sequence of interval doubings."

First see a term 'inflation' in http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf and also figure 3 at page 8. Maybe doubling construction should be expanded to municipal subsets?

For decomposing see https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01282151/document.

But I can't be sure when I will look at this, and so I mark this as wishlist queue.

I think it should be something like this:

```
def antidouble(self):
    ji = self.join_irreducibles()
    mi = self.meet_irreducibles()

    h = {}
    i = 0
    for l in self.level_sets():
        for e in l:
            h[e] = i
        i += 1

    for a in ji:
        a_ = self.lower_covers(a)[0]
        for b in mi:
            if self.compare_elements(a, b) is not None:
                continue
            b_ = self.upper_covers(b)[0]
            if h[b]-h[a_] == h[b_]-h[a]:
                A = self.interval(a_, b)
                B = self.interval(a, b_)
                if len(A) == len(B):
                    if self.subposet(A).is_isomorphic(self.subposet(B)):
                        if LatticePoset(self.subposet([e for e in self if e not in B])).day_doubling(A).is_isomorphic(self):
                            print((a_, b), (a, b_))
```

but of course is much faster to work directly with Hasse Diagram. Having temporary posets is bad, as they eat memory that is not released until you restart the whole worksheet.

Wow!  Thank you!

There must be a small bug however, because

```
antidouble(posets.PentagonPoset())
```
should print a collapsible interval (the middle relation in the longer chain), but doesn't.

In case I find out, I'll let you know!

And of course `Posets.DiamondPoset(5)` shows that the last "if" is not "iff".

But I must continue to think and code. For me they are almost the same thing.

I changed the name and add a reference. I think that

I think it comes from "de-doubling" algorithm quite naturally. Every interval doubling adds exactly one meet- and one join-irreducible element, i.e. the upper cover of bottom of the set to double and the top of the set to double. On the other direction if `|Ji(Con L)|` equals to `|Ji(L)|`, then every principal congruence must correspond to one of those "de-doubling" congruence.

Thanks for the review.

OEIS is missing most of series related to lattice enumeration. I have added some, see for example https://oeis.org/A261994. Here is code if you want to add more:

```
N = 8
LL = []
for i in range(N-2):
    x = []
    for P in Posets(i):
        try:
            x.append(LatticePoset(P.with_bounds()))
        except ValueError:
            pass
    LL.append(x)

functions = ['is_planar', 'is_upper_semimodular']

for f in functions:
    print(f)
    for i in range(2, N):
        print(i, len([L for L in LL[i-2] if attrcall(f)(L)]))
```

I think so, and even more has been said in some paper: If `S` and `T` are convex subsets so that their union is convex non-connected subset, then `L[S][T]` and `L[T][S]` are isomorphic.

Duh. Added.

Btw, this can be optimized much more. First, we don't need to count all `Ji(Con L)`, as if we found `a, b \in Ji(L)` such that `Cong(a, a_) == Cong(b, b_)`, where `e_` is the only element covered by `e`, we can't have `|Ji(Con L)|` as big as `|Ji(L)|`.

Next, a congruence generated by "antidoubling" can only have blocks of one or two element. Hence we can stop when we found even one `e` such that `Cong(e, e_)` has at least one congruence block of three or more elements.
