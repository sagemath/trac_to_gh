Add functions to test if a lattice is constructible from the one-element lattice with Day doubling of 1) interval, 2) lower pseudo-interval, 3) upper pseudo-interval and 4) any convex subset.

What should be the names for these functions?

4 is called *congruence normal*, 2 and 3 as *lower bounded* and *upper bounded* and 1 as *bounded*. But we can't add `is_bounded()` with different meaning to lattices that we already have for posets.

(See for example http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf.)

For case 1 only? Could be, got to think about this.

We now have `is_orthocomplemented()` (by me) with optional parameter `unique`. What you think about that, and having something like `is_doubling_constructable()` with mandratory string parameter having possible values `'convex', 'intevar'` etc?

Some people (at least McConville https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05213) use `congruence_uniform` instead of bounded, I think:

5.2 Congruence-normal and congruence-uniform lattices

A finite lattice L is congruence-normal if there exists a
sequence of lattices L_1,..., L_l such that L_1 is the one-element lattice, L_l = L, and for
all i, there exists an order convex subset C_i of L_i such that L_{i+1} = L_i[Ci].

A lattice is congruence-uniform if it is both congruence-normal and semidistributive.

Duh. We already have `is_uniform` after #21861.

Page 3 says this more directly "congruence-uniform lattice is any lattice constructable by a sequence of interval doubings."

In case it's possible, it would be great if the code could also produce a certificate.

For myself personally, what would be wonderful is a function that takes a lattice and produces all intervals that can be collapsed.  (I assume that, no matter which intervall is collapsed, the result should again be congruence uniform, if the original was.  But I admit that I do not know.)

Certificate should be possible.

First see a term 'inflation' in http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~jb/inflation.pdf and also figure 3 at page 8. Maybe doubling construction should be expanded to municipal subsets?

For decomposing see https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01282151/document.

But I can't be sure when I will look at this, and so I mark this as wishlist queue.

I think it should be something like this:

```
def antidouble(self):
    ji = self.join_irreducibles()
    mi = self.meet_irreducibles()

    h = {}
    i = 0
    for l in self.level_sets():
        for e in l:
            h[e] = i
        i += 1

    for a in ji:
        a_ = self.lower_covers(a)[0]
        for b in mi:
            if self.compare_elements(a, b) is not None:
                continue
            b_ = self.upper_covers(b)[0]
            if h[b]-h[a_] == h[b_]-h[a]:
                A = self.interval(a_, b)
                B = self.interval(a, b_)
                if len(A) == len(B):
                    if self.subposet(A).is_isomorphic(self.subposet(B)):
                        if LatticePoset(self.subposet([e for e in self if e not in B])).day_doubling(A).is_isomorphic(self):
                            print((a_, b), (a, b_))
```

but of course is much faster to work directly with Hasse Diagram. Having temporary posets is bad, as they eat memory that is not released until you restart the whole worksheet.

Wow!  Thank you!

There must be a small bug however, because

```
antidouble(posets.PentagonPoset())
```
should print a collapsible interval (the middle relation in the longer chain), but doesn't.

In case I find out, I'll let you know!

More about this. *Free Lattices* by Ralph S. Freese, Jaroslav JeÅ¾ek and James Bryant Nation p. 76 says that a lattice `L` is lower bounded iff `|Ji(L)| = |Ji(Con L)|`, and of course dually for upper bounded. The congurence lattice of a lattice is always distributive. A distributive lattice L has `|Ji(L)| = |Mi(L)|`. Hence a lattice `L` can be (totally) bounded only if it has `|Ji(L)| = |Mi(L)|`. That can be used as a fast check to reject lattices that clearly can't be (totallyt) bounded.

And of course `Posets.DiamondPoset(5)` shows that the last "if" is not "iff".

But I must continue to think and code. For me they are almost the same thing.

I don't think it is necessary.

I think it comes from "de-doubling" algorithm quite naturally. Every interval doubling adds exactly one meet- and one join-irreducible element, i.e. the upper cover of bottom of the set to double and the top of the set to double. On the other direction if `|Ji(Con L)|` equals to `|Ji(L)|`, then every principal congruence must correspond to one of those "de-doubling" congruence.

Thanks for the review.

OEIS is missing most of series related to lattice enumeration. I have added some, see for example https://oeis.org/A261994. Here is code if you want to add more:

```
N = 8
LL = []
for i in range(N-2):
    x = []
    for P in Posets(i):
        try:
            x.append(LatticePoset(P.with_bounds()))
        except ValueError:
            pass
    LL.append(x)

functions = ['is_planar', 'is_upper_semimodular']

for f in functions:
    print(f)
    for i in range(2, N):
        print(i, len([L for L in LL[i-2] if attrcall(f)(L)]))
```

I think so, and even more has been said in some paper: If `S` and `T` are convex subsets so that their union is convex non-connected subset, then `L[S][T]` and `L[T][S]` are isomorphic.

Duh. Added.

Btw, this can be optimized much more. First, we don't need to count all `Ji(Con L)`, as if we found `a, b \in Ji(L)` such that `Cong(a, a_) == Cong(b, b_)`, where `e_` is the only element covered by `e`, we can't have `|Ji(Con L)|` as big as `|Ji(L)|`.

Next, a congruence generated by "antidoubling" can only have blocks of one or two element. Hence we can stop when we found even one `e` such that `Cong(e, e_)` has at least one congruence block of three or more elements.
