I don't see anything here alerting DEVELOPERS to this change, though I admit there are lots of files touched.  It should be very clear how to format things in the developer guide.

Also, this should be announced (if not discussed) on sage-devel, if it hasn't been already.  (I'm not suggesting this is a bad change, but just making sure people are aware - I stumbled upon this quite randomly.)

It is hard for me to see who would be against this change. And there already is for example #21592 and #21652, and also see #21647. Should all those been discussed too?

One can argue all of those examples were "wrong", for some definition of wrong, while this one is presumably at least *grammatically* wrong.

But my actual rationale in posting is to suggest you make sure people know, so that you don't have to open 25 more tickets fixing this from people who didn't notice this otherwise-obscure ticket.
