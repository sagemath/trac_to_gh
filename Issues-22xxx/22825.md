Symbolic constants become expressions. That's probably why this happens:

```
sage: NaN?
Type:           Expression
String form:    NaN
Length:         0
File:           ~/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx
Docstring:     
   Nearly all expressions are created by calling
...
```
It should be possible to get the docstring for the embedded Pyobject.
