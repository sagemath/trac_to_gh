Building upon #22658 (Support interface coercion `polymake(X)` for `Polyhedron`), we provide a backend in `backend_polymake.py` that does all `Polyhedron` computations using polymake (in particular, the initial computation of the double description).

For quadratic field extensions of the rationals, this backend should be faster than the generic implementation in Python (unless the pexpect overhead dominates).

Two things I see:

- `def _polymake_` is missing doctests.
- In `__iter__`, you should use ```self``` in the docstrings. You also don't need to have an `INPUT:` block since there essentially no input.

Otherwise LGTM modulo the dependency.

I've merged in #22740, which was intended to be a follow-up ticket, hoping that this will fix the doc build problems. 
Also merged the updated branch prereq #22658 (which I'll mark as dup), which brings in 8.0.beta0. 
And added `backend_polymake` to the discrete geometry section of the manual. 
Documentation builds for me on this branch.
