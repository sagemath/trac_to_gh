Up to now I think that it is not a problem to don't have png in giac from sage. giacpy or pynac are not using it.

For what it worth, for [Sage Debian Live](https://sagedebianlive.metelu.net/), i compile giac (from within Sage) with xcas support, by installing the system's fltk, remove the `--disable` flag and the `nofltk-check.patch`, so i guess for such a graphical use, png support could be useful.

What would be a correct patch (so that i can add it to SDL until it get fixed) ?
