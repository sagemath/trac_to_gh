how do you approach this problem? since numeric coefficients are cast into SR which is inexact, one has: 

```
sage: f1 = x - 1
sage: [op.base_ring().is_exact() for op in f1.operands()]
[False, False]

sage: f2 = x - 1.0
sage: [op.base_ring().is_exact() for op in f2.operands()]
[False, False]
```

But maybe not every of these rings has an `is_exact` member?

Regarding real and complex numbers only, basically, numerical representations are inexact:

```
RealDoubleField()
RealField(prec)
RealIntervalField(prec)
RealBallField(prec)
ComplexDoubleField()
ComplexField(prec)
ComplexIntervalField(prec)
ComplexBallField(prec)
```

Algebraic representations are exact:

```
AlgebraicRealField()
NumberField(poly)
QuadraticField(n)
RationalField()
AlgebraicField()
UniversalCyclotomicField()
CyclotomicField(n)
```

Symbolic ring is a mixture, so it is inexact.

The main problem are `RealLazyField()` and `ComplexLazyField()` which claim to be exact, but they are not:

```
sage: a = RLF(0.1)
sage: a
0.10000000000000001?
sage: a._value
0.100000000000000
sage: a._value.parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: RLF.is_exact()
True
```

Perhaps should we fix this.
