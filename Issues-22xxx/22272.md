I haven't seen this one before:

```
[gap-4.8.3] Installing (copying) files...
[gap-4.8.3] cp: cannot create regular file '/home/buildbot/slave/sage_git/build/local/gap/gap-4.8.3/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/gap': Text file busy
[gap-4.8.3] Error copying built GAP files.
```
Appears only randomly. The "text file busy" error means that we are trying to modify a currently-running executable (the text segment, nothing to do with plain text). Presumably thats a parallel build dependency error.

I have seen this quite a bit, and yes, killing GAP processes helps.
No idea how to fix this nicely, though.

Of course the `-p` is important. I will confused because `-p` does *two* things:

1. It will create any non-existing parent directories.

2. It will not complain if the directory already exists.

I thought that the `-p` was only needed for 2. but it is obviously also needed for 1.
