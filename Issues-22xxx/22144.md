Currently, every face is in its own IndexFaceSet.

One can use one IndexFaceSet for all the faces together.

Also enhance the STL ouput by cutting no-triangular faces into triangles.

and make sure that all faces are oriented outwards.

This may also help simplify further the PLY export later.

could you please try

```
sage: P = polytopes.truncated_octahedron()
sage: Q = P.plot().all[-1]
sage: Q.save('machin.stl')
```
it works for me. The second line isolate the IndexFaceSet from other bells and whistles (plot of edges and vertices)

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:10\" align=\"right\">comment:10</div>\n\nI tried your example.  \n\nFor me, the second line still was a `Graphics3DGroup` so no `face_list` attribute that `save(...stl)` uses at this point in its code. So `Q.save('machin.stl')` fails with the error message `'Graphics3dGroup' object has no attribute 'face_list'`.  \n\nHowever, `P.plot().all[-1].all[i]` will give a `Graphics3D Object` for every appropriate `i` ( here there are 14 faces, so `i in range(14)`).

I tried your example.  

For me, the second line still was a `Graphics3DGroup` so no `face_list` attribute that `save(...stl)` uses at this point in its code. So `Q.save('machin.stl')` fails with the error message `'Graphics3dGroup' object has no attribute 'face_list'`.  

However, `P.plot().all[-1].all[i]` will give a `Graphics3D Object` for every appropriate `i` ( here there are 14 faces, so `i in range(14)`). Then we can recover the full list of faces by putting all faces together. 

```
sage: P = polytopes.truncated_octahedron()
sage: Q = P.plot().all[-1].all[:-1]
sage: my_face_list = [face for face_as_IFS in Q for face in face_as_IFS.face_list()] 
```

And then, I can call the `save(....stl')` method on an IndexFaceSet built out from this list.

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.index_face_set import IndexFaceSet
sage: polytope_as_IFS = IndexFaceSet(my_face_list)
sage: polytope_as_IFS.save('machin.stl')
```

It will again fail, but for a different reason - the faces are not triangles. 

[Edit] By the way, I was testing on the develop branch checked out from the github repository.

I went trough all of the examples in `plot3d?` The plot looked reasonably good. But did you wanted to test the on-screen image or the `stl` export ? 

None of those examples could export to `stl` before (I mean in Sage 7.4), but now, some of them manage to actually export : 
  

```
sage: plot3d(lambda x, y: x^2 + y^2, (-2,2), (-2,2)).save('rho2.stl')
```

```
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x, -pi, pi), (y, -pi, pi)).save('sinxy.stl')
```

and many others.

Those who do not work, have options added (other than `plot_points` or `mesh` or `transformation`), like for example:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: P = plot3d(x+y+sin(x*y), (x,-10,10),(y,-10,10), opacity=0.87, color='blue')
sage: Q = plot3d(x-2*y-cos(x*y),(x,-10,10),(y,-10,10),opacity=0.3,color='red')
sage: (P+Q).save('twoplanes.stl')

No, I was just meaning to check the displayed plots. Thanks for doing that.

Your job as a reviewer, if you accept it:

- check that all doctests pass (wait for the bot, and run the tests yourself on the modified files)
- check that the doc is good and correctly formatted (should be ok, but you can think of improvements)
- be sure that this is an improvement over the existing situation
- ideally, be sure that there is no better solution to do the same thing (should not apply here)

This should be an easy review, I think. If you have more questions or suggestions, I am all ears. Once you are satisfied, set to positive review and put your name in the reviewer field at top of the page.

I also think one could keep further enhancements to later tickets.
