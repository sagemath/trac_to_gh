Currently, every face is in its own IndexFaceSet.

One can use one IndexFaceSet for all the faces together.

Also enhance the STL ouput by cutting no-triangular faces into triangles.

and make sure that all faces are oriented outwards.

This may also help simplify further the PLY export later.

it works for me. The second line isolate the IndexFaceSet from other bells and whistles (plot of edges and vertices)

I tried your example.  

For me, the second line still was a `Graphics3DGroup` so no `face_list` attribute that `save(...stl)` uses at this point in its code. So `Q.save('machin.stl')` fails with the error message `'Graphics3dGroup' object has no attribute 'face_list'`.  

However, `P.plot().all[-1].all[i]` will give a `Graphics3D Object` for every appropriate `i` ( here there are 14 faces, so `i in range(14)`). Then we can recover the full list of faces by putting all faces together. 

```
sage: P = polytopes.truncated_octahedron()
sage: Q = P.plot().all[-1].all[:-1]
sage: my_face_list = [face for face_as_IFS in Q for face in face_as_IFS.face_list()] 
```

And then, I can call the `save(....stl')` method on an IndexFaceSet built out from this list.

```
sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.index_face_set import IndexFaceSet
sage: polytope_as_IFS = IndexFaceSet(my_face_list)
sage: polytope_as_IFS.save('machin.stl')
```

It will again fail, but for a different reason - the faces are not triangles. 

[Edit] By the way, I was testing on the develop branch checked out from the github repository.

Well, I assumed that the facet_equations are coming from the defining inequations of the polytope, so must be all coherent.

It was either everybody inwards or everybody outwards, so I tried < 0 and it works.

None of those examples could export to `stl` before (I mean in Sage 7.4), but now, some of them manage to actually export : 
  

```
sage: plot3d(lambda x, y: x^2 + y^2, (-2,2), (-2,2)).save('rho2.stl')
```

```
sage: plot3d(sin(x*y), (x, -pi, pi), (y, -pi, pi)).save('sinxy.stl')
```

and many others.

Those who do not work, have options added (other than `plot_points` or `mesh` or `transformation`), like for example:

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y')
sage: P = plot3d(x+y+sin(x*y), (x,-10,10),(y,-10,10), opacity=0.87, color='blue')
sage: Q = plot3d(x-2*y-cos(x*y),(x,-10,10),(y,-10,10),opacity=0.3,color='red')
sage: (P+Q).save('twoplanes.stl')
```

Your job as a reviewer, if you accept it:

- check that all doctests pass (wait for the bot, and run the tests yourself on the modified files)
- check that the doc is good and correctly formatted (should be ok, but you can think of improvements)
- be sure that this is an improvement over the existing situation
- ideally, be sure that there is no better solution to do the same thing (should not apply here)

This should be an easy review, I think. If you have more questions or suggestions, I am all ears. Once you are satisfied, set to positive review and put your name in the reviewer field at top of the page.

I also think one could keep further enhancements to later tickets.

There is one test 

`$ sage -t src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/plot.py`  

that fails.

```
Failed example:
    proj.polygons
Expected:
    [[2, 0, 1], [3, 0, 1], [3, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2]]
Got:
    [[1, 0, 2], [3, 0, 1], [2, 0, 3], [3, 1, 2]]
```

I looked through the example, and exported the stl in this precise example. It works, and normal are consistent, so maybe you should change the expected result accordingly in the doc.
