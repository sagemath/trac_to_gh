This is a follow-up on #22418, which broke the `V=0 make` feature.

This ticket repairs it. Also, it makes `make V=0` behave the same as `V=0 make`, in that the logfiles always contain `V=1` logs.

Explanation: Setting `V=1` in the sub-makes works for `V=0 make` but not for `make V=0` because in the latter case `MAKEFLAGS` is set to `V=0` and can't be overridden by the environment variable. Need to edit `MAKEFLAGS` as well.

That's not really correct. The correct statement is "only the bottom-level logger should set `V=1`". There can be situations where there is only one level and the top-level logger is also the bottom-level logger.

For example, when you run `./sage -i $PKGNAME`. In that case, there will be only one level of logger.
