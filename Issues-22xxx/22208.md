I'm not sure if this is kosher, but I would like 

```
sage: G = GaussianIntegers()
sage: G(2+I)
```
to "just work".

Looks like a conversion as in `symbolic/expression_conversions.py` should do the trick.

I'm reopening this because there are two ways to interpret this ticket:

1. Allow `G(2 + I)` to just work, using the symbol `I`.

2. Allow `G(expr)` to work, where `expr` is some symbolic expression representing a number field element.

Only the first one would be fixed by #18036.

I double-checked, and the algebra LGTM. I do have one minor docstring fix:

```diff
         """
-        Convert a non-number field element x into this number field.
+        Convert a non-number field element ``x`` into this number field.
 
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``x`` -- a non number field element x, e.g., a list, integer,
-          rational, or polynomial.
+        - ``x`` -- a non number field element, e.g., a list, integer,
+          rational, or polynomial
```
Once that is done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
