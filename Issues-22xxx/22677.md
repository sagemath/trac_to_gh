ironically, it does not work on gentoo Lunix with gcc 5.4.0.

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 118.6 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
```
and two more brial-related errors.
While numerous

```
warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]
``` 
are probably OK, 

```
[sagelib-7.6] In file included from /home/dima/Sage/sage-dev/src/sage/libs/polybori/pb_wrap.h:22:0,

It could also be that we must switch to gcc 6. Can you check in what Linux configuration this works for you?
