Function fields part of Sage has long been neglected and has little significant functionality besides basic arithmetic and frameworks. This ticket improves the situation by two tasks:

1. Add global function fields (with complete functionality for the theory of AG codes) 

2. Clean existing code (mostly revising docstrings)

A pdf for a short introduction to global function fields in Sage is attached. 

---
Now the long-term process to merge the global function field machinery to Sage has finished. This ticket played the role of meta-ticket that tracks the multi-step process:

|      |        |          |
|------|--------|----------|
| Step | Ticket | Comments |
|0 | #24591 | Trim the existing code. Add several classes that are now just stubs.  |
|1 | #25435 | Add orders and ideals. |
| 2 | #26616 |  Add places. |
| 3 | #27121 |  Add divisors. |
| 4 | #27370 |  Add differentials. |
| 5 |  #27418 |  Add completions. |
| 6 | #27558 | Last fixes and additions. |

The branch is essentially a patch bomb, and is not suitable for a regular review yet. But I see no way to split the code as it consists of several parts dependent on one another. My plan is to have people to play with it for some time, and I do bug fixes and improve documentation until there appears someone who can review the whole code. I don't know how long this procedure would take. Though I want it to be merged to Sage as soon as possible from my heart :-)

I have done this task during my sabbatical year, which is going to end soon. After that, I will not have much time but to maintain the code just not to be bitrotting.

> Are you in contact with the people who were working on divisors recently at Sage Days 86.5?

No. I won't have time to cooperate with other people.

I looked at their wiki page. It seems that his(?) task in "basic arithmetic in function fields" may overlap with what I did here. I implemented fractional ideals in the classical way using hermite normal form while he uses OM representation, about which I know nothing. Practically he may use my branch as a tool/base to experiment and build his system. It seems his approach is more suitable for global function fields defined by more complicated equations. Thus it could be the case that the classical approach and the OM representation approach complement each other.

Hi Kwankyu,
I really appreciate your massive effort here, but I don't think it is realistic that this patch bomb will get quickly merged. Bugs are much better fixed before being introduced into Sage. Why is it not possible to break this ticket into a number of smaller ones? Each one can then be reviewed with the proper care. Some tickets could basically contain just the class structure of some object, while complicated algorithms for a specific task could be tickets by themselves. Possibly keeping this ticket as a wontfix reference ticket, reviewers of the smaller ones can see what your aim is. You could give an overview of the set of tickets on a dedicated subpage on the wiki. 

I want to help out with testing and reviewing, but I don't see any time that I could take out 2 weeks straight to review this beast...

Best,
Johan

Thanks for the comments, Johan. You are right. That is what should happen, as no reviewer wants to swallow a patch bomb.

I really had no idea about how to spend a pleasant time splitting the big code, which seems an organic whole, into smaller chunks, even with my humble git skill. 

So while having dinner, I thought about this problem. And now I think I can do something about it. It seems I have to plan carefully before making tickets.

Let me spend some days to plan this out, so that you won't be deprived of 2 weeks straight :-)

That sounds great :-) Realistically, I won't have much time in most of January (important conference deadlines), but I hope to have some time for smaller tickets in February. You should probably expect that getting all of the functionality of this ticket into Sage will take quite a while, though. 

Some tips from my experience with implementing coding theory during the "ACTIS project": expect that the review process will cause the design to change, and later tickets can be lightly or massively impacted. If you cut this ticket into, say 10 tickets, then consider not setting up all 10 tickets at once with full dependency lattice.

I'd like to get the divisor basis code (the Hess algorithm) working with function fields over QQ (and QQbar), but I'll wait until this patch gets incorporated into the main branch before trying to add to it.

Looks good!

Suggestion:

In the documentation for class `FunctionFieldPlace`, `prime` is defined as "prime ideal associated with the place".  I assume this means a prime ideal of an order (as opposed to an ideal of the coordinate ring).  I suggest documenting that more clearly, and perhaps checking when an instance is created if it's the right kind of ideal and throwing an exception otherwise.

I can see someone trying to do this:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: C = Curve(y^2-x^3-1)

sage: FunctionFieldPlace(R*(x-2,y-3))
```

or more sensibly this:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: C = Curve((y^2-x^3-1).homogenize(z))

sage: FunctionFieldPlace(R*(x-2,y-3).homogenize(z))
```

Also, is there a way to construct a `FunctionField` from a `Curve`?

For a function field, there is no coordinate ring, and you are not supposed to use the class `FunctionFieldPlace` directly, just like you use the constructor `Curve` rather than a  curve class.

The function field code is not yet integrated with the curve code. This is something to be done later.

Could we discuss that a bit, since that's a major use case and might affect how the code is designed?

There's two common things to do with a place on a curve that don't seem very easy with the current code:

1. get the coordinates of the point under the place

   We've got `place_below` in `FFP_Global`, that I think should get us to a prime ideal in the coordinate ring, and from there we can get to coordinates of the point, but I don't see anything more straightforward than that

2. compute a series expansion of a function in terms of a uniformizing variable

   We got `local_uniformizer` in `FFP_Rational`, that returns a uniformizing variable, but I don't think there's a method to do a series expansion

Also, what's the difference between a global place and a rational place?

This would be part of the code integrating a curve with its function field.

No. `place_below` is nothing to do with the coordinate ring. A function field is an extension of a rational function field. `place below` return the place of the rational function field below a place of the function field.

> 2. compute a series expansion of a function in terms of a uniformizing variable

I recommend you to read the attached pdf for short introduction to the function field code. Yes, there is a method for series expansion of functions at a place.

> Also, what's the difference between a global place and a rational place?

You seem to mean places of global function fields and places of rational function fields.

If you consult Stichtenoth's book Algebraic Function Fields and Codes, then you would be better prepared to understand and use the function field code of this ticket. That book also explains how curve and function field are related.

I guess you mean doctest failures in the stable branch of this ticket. The branch is provided for those who may want to try the global function field code before a full merge of the code to Sage, which would take quite some time. You should expect that it is not completely "stable", though I put some efforts to make it so.

Actual long-term merge process is going on through the child tickets as described in the ticket description. So all necessary fixes would go to the branches in the child tickets.
>

The proper parameter name for that is "algorithm" in Sage.

> Should I make those changes to this ticket?  Change this git branch to be public?  

No. Sage development occurs incrementally. You should base your code on either the Sage develop branch or possibly a branch of other ticket. For that, you create your own ticket. It is possible that you make your branch from a branch of some child ticket of the present ticket. In that case, you have to fill the dependencies field of your ticket.

I've created a new ticket #25494 that (partially) implements function fields using `kash`.  Both prime finite fields and QQ are supported as the underlying constant field (no algebraic extensions of them, though).  A lot of the methods aren't implemented, but enough are done to allow Riemann-Roch basis calculations:

```
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(QQ, implementation='kash')
sage: R.<Y> = F[]
sage: L.<y> = F.extension(Y^2 - x^8 - 1)
sage: O = L.maximal_order()
sage: I = O.ideal(x, y-1)
sage: P = I.place()
sage: D = P.divisor()
sage: D.basis_function_space()
[1]
sage: (4*D).basis_function_space()
[1, 1/x^4*y + 1/x^4]
```

It actually uses Kwankyu Lee's Sage implementation of the Hess algorithm.  Although kash implements the Hess algorithm, it turns out that klee's code works fine; all that kash is needed for is constructing and manipulating orders and ideals.

Since `kash` is closed source, and doesn't support anything like `QQbar` (a major need for my application), this code is probably only useful to verify our results.  We still need a native Sage implementation.

Would you like to add a link to #25494 on this ticket's description?

<a id='comment:82'>Comment 82:</a>
Also, what is the `gens` method supposed to do for ideals?  Looking at the test cases in `ideal.py`, it seems like it returns some kind of basis.  My version just returns the generators used to create the ideal, and `basis` needs to be called for an actual basis.  Which is correct?

No, it should be the other way around. I mean that #25494 should contain a link to this ticket if it depends on this ticket.

#25494 does contain a link to #22982 in its "dependencies".

I suggest putting a link in this ticket (just like you have links to the sub tickets) so that people will know that we've got a version of this code that works over `QQ`.
