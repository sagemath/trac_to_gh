sagenb is not compatible with python3, at least in the current version 1.0.1

The latest release 1.0.2 is certainly slightly better in this respect, but maybe still not fully py3 compliant.

Let us do the upgrade to 1.0.2. We also re-activate the build of sagenb in sagePy3, to help building the doc of sagePy3.

Side remark: to cut the ties between sagenb and sage, we need to get rid:
* of the cluster interact #24760 and #25074
* of the mandelbrot interact #24994 
* of the graph editor #?????
* of the graph database navigator #?????
* of the interactive debugger #?????
* of calls to some tab completion function #24998

tarball with sagenb update: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/releases/download/1.0.2/sagenb-1.0.2.tar.bz2

I don't really see any reason to not keep the legacy notebook around for quite some time, granting that it will not receive much attention.   We just got a support request from someone using Sage 4.6 (!) who really didn't want to upgrade; this is positively new compared to that.

But I definitely agree that whatever the absolute minimum needed to get sagenb to work minimally with python3 is fine.

Please test https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/tree/1.0.rc0
(copy of the current master)
before I go ahead with making a new Sage package.
It works for me following the instructions in HACKING (updated, to take care of changed names and of the need to deal with mathjax).

Given that Sage does not run with Python 3 yet, it's a bit early to say, no?

>

Probably not really, for it does work without #20922 - I don't get doctest failures mentoined in comment 4 on #20922.

```
$ sage -t --long local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sagenb/notebook/challenge.py

```

I also do not see any mention of `click` package in sagenb's installation log.

Dima, could you please make a new release of sagenb ?

Currently (apart from the mathjax issue above in spkg-install) sagenb 1.0.1 installs with sage3, but fails to run because of 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/chapoton/sage3/src/bin/sage-notebook", line 268, in <module>

```
which has been fixed after the release of 1.0.1

This way to find the mathjax package seem to be very ugly... Maybe Erik would have an idea for a better replacement that would also work for python3 ?

Why don't we use `ln -s $SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax mathjax`? Or use `$SAGE_SHARE/mathjax`? And are those any better?

Also, on OS X at least, the command should be `ln -s -h ...` – as it is, if the mathjax link already exists, then the current command creates another link within that linked folder. It is okay if the `sagenb/data` directory contains

```
mathjax -> ../../../../../share/mathjax/
```
but it doesn't make sense for `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/mathjax` to contain this.

(On OS X, the documentation for the `-h` flag says "If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow it." There is also a `-n` flag: "Same as -h, for compatibility with other ln implementations.")

I have modified the ln to mathjax. This seems to work well with python2. Not yet tested with python3. 

We need people that test if the new proposed release of sagenb works well enough. Not much has changed since the last release.

Well, just `sage -n=sagenb`. But it will fail to start, because of twisted or some of the latest commited changes, not yet in the release here.

We only need to make sure that sage3 builds and starts with the branch here.

We also need to make sure that for sage2, the upgrade of sagenb does not break something inside the notebook.

Thanks Dima. It seems that you got a hard time doing that..

Failing is as expected. Maybe this specific issue is already fixed by the pull request done after you made the release. But this is not so important : let us keep that for another ticket.

Do you confirm that sage3 builds and starts with the branch here ? I think I did check that also. So it seems to be good to go from this point of view.

So now, there only remains to see if the branch here is not going to break anything in the sage2 sagenb.
