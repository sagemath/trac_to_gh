sagenb is not compatible with python3, at least in the current version 1.0.1

The latest release 1.0.2 is certainly slightly better in this respect, but maybe still not fully py3 compliant.

Let us do the upgrade to 1.0.2. We also re-activate the build of sagenb in sagePy3, to help building the doc of sagePy3.

Side remark: to cut the ties between sagenb and sage, we need to get rid:
* of the cluster interact #24760 and #25074
* of the mandelbrot interact #24994 
* of the graph editor #?????
* of the graph database navigator #?????
* of the interactive debugger #?????
* of calls to some tab completion function #24998

tarball with sagenb update: https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/releases/download/1.0.2/sagenb-1.0.2.tar.bz2

I don't really see any reason to not keep the legacy notebook around for quite some time, granting that it will not receive much attention.   We just got a support request from someone using Sage 4.6 (!) who really didn't want to upgrade; this is positively new compared to that.

Given that Sage does not run with Python 3 yet, it's a bit early to say, no?

> 
> What about comment:6 about #20922 - still valid?


Probably not really, for it does work without #20922 - I don't get doctest failures mentoined in comment 4 on #20922.

I also do not see any mention of `click` package in sagenb's installation log.

Failing is as expected. Maybe this specific issue is already fixed by the pull request done after you made the release. But this is not so important : let us keep that for another ticket.

Do you confirm that sage3 builds and starts with the branch here ? I think I did check that also. So it seems to be good to go from this point of view.

So now, there only remains to see if the branch here is not going to break anything in the sage2 sagenb.
