While working on #22452, I found a couple of issues that might be dealt with in a separate ticket.

- The pexpect interfaces and the interface elements inherit from `Parent` resp. from `Element`. But they override `__repr__`, which is bad. So, I change `__repr__` into single underscore methods in all interfaces.

- The default implementation of `_true_symbol` and some others rely on the assumption the `self.eval(...)` returns a string representation when applied to an integer or bool. But this assumption is violated for Polymake. However, `self.get(...)` *is* supposed to return a string representation for everything. I am stating these specifications in the doc and replace `eval` with `get` where needed.

- For interface elements, I replace `self.parent()` by `self._check_valid()` in a couple of places, since that returns the parent after testing that it is still valid.

- In the string representation of an interface element of a crashed interface, I show the crash message, so that it becomes a bit clearer what has happened.

I have now also sanitised string representation of pexpect elements. "Sanitise" means: There is a default `__repr__` method that is not supposed to be overridden, and if anything needs to be overridden then it is the single underscore `_repr_`. The change mainly consisted how invalid objects are printed.

Since I am not particularly eager to remove the superfluous functions mentioned in the ticket description, I'll let this be "needs review" --- now I have the prerequisites for #22452.

I don't think that you should remove doctests.

If you remove a method which is no longer needed, then move the doctests somewhere else (say, at the top of the module if you don't see a better place) instead of removing them.

        except ValueError:

you should use the exception message instead of hardcoding `"defined in terms of closed session"`. Maybe there are other reasons why a `ValueError` can be raised. And it might also make sense to replace `except ValueError` by `except Exception`.

No. Here is the code of `_check_valid()`:

```
    def _check_valid(self):
        """
        Check that this object is valid, i.e., the session in which this
        object is defined is still running. This is relevant for
        interpreters that can't be interrupted via ctrl-C, hence get
        restarted.
        """
        try:
            P = self.parent()
            if P is None:
                raise ValueError("The %s session in which this object was defined is no longer running."%P.name())
        except AttributeError:
            raise ValueError("The session in which this object was defined is no longer running.")
        return P
```
So, catching the ValueError is exactly the same as saying "the session is no longer running or some noob overrode `Element.parent` by something that raises a ValueError and thus the whole interface is broken anyway.

Currently `eval` and `get` have a different semantics, which I tried to explain in the documentation that I added. The reason to introduce `_get_primitive` is performance: If doing `MyInterface.eval('1')` returns `''` then you need a print statement, such as `MyInterface.eval('print(1)')`. However, if you are in an interface such as Gap or Singular then the print statement is not needed, and of course it is a bit faster to not use the print statement.

Thus, for *efficiency*, the default is to not use the print statement, but for an interface that needs the print statement you are able to override the default.

By the way, how do I use the exception message? If I do

```
    except ValueError, msg:
```
then `"no longer" in msg` doesn't work (ValueError has no `__contains__` method) and `"no longer" in msg.message` gives a DeprecationWarning.

So, am I really supposed to do `"no longer" in repr(msg)`? Or did you mean I should let the `__repr__` method return `'(invalid {} object - {})'.format(self.parent() or type(self), msg)`?

> Maybe there are other reasons why a `ValueError` can be raised. And it might also make sense to replace `except ValueError` by `except Exception`.

I was taught by several people to not catch a general `Exception` (in contrast to a more specific type of error) unless it is absolutely clear that I do not want that exception to be propagated. And that's not the case here. If a different error occurs then I don't want to hide it.

I already answered that. I was bitten by name mangling. While

```
sage: r = singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: M = singular.matrix(2,2,"(25/47*x^2*y^4 + 63/127*x + 27)^3,y,0,1")
sage: M.rename('T')
sage: M.__custom_name
'T'
```
does work, `hasattr(self,'__custom_name')` returned `False` when I had it in the `_repr_` method.

But if you use `self.__custom_name` in the same module in which the private attribute is defined (namely `sage.structure.sage_object`) then there is no point to use the accessor method, as it is slower.

Just to be on the safe side (maybe I had a typo such as `hasattr(self,'__custon_name')`?), I'll try to change it into using `self.__custom_name?` and tell you what happens.

If you need the print statement then use the (already existing) method `.get()`, not `.eval()`. The same applies to Singular:

```
sage: r = singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: M = singular.matrix(2,2,"(25/47*x^2*y^4 + 63/127*x + 27)^3,y,0,1")

For Singular and Gap, `_get_primitive()` does the same as `eval()`, which is fine because primitives (such as integers) in Gap or Singular do not need to be printed in order to get their string representations. So, blindly using `get()` has a small performance effect.

However, note that this ticket is a dependency for #22452. And in Polymake, you need an explicit print statement even for primitives; thus, blindly using `eval()` wouldn't do the right thing.

Hence, it is needed to introduce a hook `_get_primitive` to customise it.

No, I think the default should cover the case which makes it least likely to make mistakes.

I also think that many interfaces have custom `get()` methods but don't really need it. For example, GP has a custom `get()` method calling `print()` but I don't see how GP would treat variables differently from "primitive" objects.

Also, it is mentally a lot easier to understand if `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`. Until all your extra explanations I found it hard to understand what `_get_primitive()` is about. If you say that `_get_primitive()` is just an optimization for `get()`, then it makes a lot of sense that `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`.

It does treat them differently:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ,3,3)
sage: m = gp(M); n = gp(15)
sage: gp.get(m._name), gp.get(n._name)
('[0, -1, 2; 2, -12, 0; -2, 1, 2]', '15')
sage: gp.eval(m._name), gp.eval(n._name)
('\n[ 0  -1 2]\n\n[ 2 -12 0]\n\n[-2   1 2]\n', '15')
```

Apparently the creator of the interface thought that the latter result is nicer than the former.

> Also, it is mentally a lot easier to understand if `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`. Until all your extra explanations I found it hard to understand what `_get_primitive()` is about. If you say that `_get_primitive()` is just an optimization for `get()`, then it makes a lot of sense that `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`.

__First proposition:__ `_get_primitive_` should be used in the default comparison method.

__Rationale:__ Using `eval()` in the default comparison means I'll have to override the comparison method in the Polymake interface (doable of course, but I'd like to avoid it). Using `get()` means to lose performance of comparison (thus, an important operation) in all other interfaces.

__Second proposition:__ If `_get_primitive_` is used in comparison methods, it should default to `eval`.

__Rationale:__ If instead it would default to `get`, I'd need to override the default in ALL existing interfaces, or I would have to live with a performance loss in comparison.

__Counterargument:__ I do override `_get_primitive` in Polymake mainly in order to avoid overriding `__cmp__` (I also use it in helper methods, but they are cached and thus using `get()` is fine there). Hence, why do I introduce `_get_primitive` and override it in Polymake, rather than I change the helper methods to use `get()` and then override `__cmp__` in Polymake?

You mean that the former

```
[0, -1, 2; 2, -12, 0; -2, 1, 2]
```
is nicer than the latter

```
[ 0  -1 2]

[ 2 -12 0]

[-2   1 2]
```

I think it depends a lot on the application. If the output of `get()` is supposed to be machine-readable, then certainly the former is nicer.

I did this in the current commit, and I changed the ticket description to say that I believe the mentioned functions "could be removed, but not on this ticket".

So, I guess that means "needs review" again.

I didn't intend to do whitespace changes, however my editor (geany) is configured to change tabs into four blanks and to remove trailing whitespace when saving a file.

How should I proceed? Shall I rewrite history, force-push and then rebase #22452 on top of it? Or shall I add a commit that re-introduces the whitespace (probably not)?

Force push would even be more trouble now. But I agree that for diff readers, seeing all these tiny modifications is annoying. For the future I would suggest: just start with a first commit that deal with whitespaces and nothing else. Then add non trivial commits on top of that.

I said "I didn't *intend* to...". So, the fact that I have this option by default is a good when creating a new file, but bad when editing an existing file that doesn't conform to the standards that sage has regarding trailing whitespace.

Why?

You should not force-push here and then base #22452. Instead, you should force-push #22452, checkout the commit corresponding to this ticket and force-push that.

That's very easy to do.

I don't understand that at all. This ticket is a dependency for #22452. Do you suggest to revert the dependencies?

No. If I understand things correctly, #22452 contains the commit from this ticket (#22501). So you could rebase #22452 but keeping a separation between the commits which really belong to #22501 and the ones which really belong to #22452 (so not squashing everything together).

Yes, it does.

> So you could rebase #22452 but keeping a separation between the commits which really belong to #22501 and the ones which really belong to #22452 (so not squashing everything together).

That's why I suggested to force a change here and then rebase the commits that really belong to #22452 on top of the new forced commit from here (#22501).

> Then you can force-push #22452. At this point, the branch from #22501 will no longer be a sub-branch of #22452. But that can be fixed by resetting the branch on #22501 to a commit which was pushed on #22452.

It seems to me that the result is equivalent to what I suggest.

So, my plan now is:

- Create a new single commit for this ticket (#22501) that removes trailing whitespace only in the lines that have also been edited for other reasons.
- Force-push the new commit here.
- Rebase the commits from #22452 that really belong to #22452 on top of the new commit. Push (of course using force) the result there.
