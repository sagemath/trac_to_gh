While working on #22452, I found a couple of issues that might be dealt with in a separate ticket.

- The pexpect interfaces and the interface elements inherit from `Parent` resp. from `Element`. But they override `__repr__`, which is bad. So, I change `__repr__` into single underscore methods in all interfaces.

- The default implementation of `_true_symbol` and some others rely on the assumption the `self.eval(...)` returns a string representation when applied to an integer or bool. But this assumption is violated for Polymake. However, `self.get(...)` *is* supposed to return a string representation for everything. I am stating these specifications in the doc and replace `eval` with `get` where needed.

- For interface elements, I replace `self.parent()` by `self._check_valid()` in a couple of places, since that returns the parent after testing that it is still valid.

- In the string representation of an interface element of a crashed interface, I show the crash message, so that it becomes a bit clearer what has happened.

Keywords: pexpect, days84

I have now also sanitised string representation of pexpect elements. "Sanitise" means: There is a default `__repr__` method that is not supposed to be overridden, and if anything needs to be overridden then it is the single underscore `_repr_`. The change mainly consisted how invalid objects are printed.

Since I am not particularly eager to remove the superfluous functions mentioned in the ticket description, I'll let this be "needs review" --- now I have the prerequisites for #22452.

Here

```
        except ValueError:
            return '(invalid {} object -- defined in terms of closed session)'.format(self.parent())
```
you should use the exception message instead of hardcoding `"defined in terms of closed session"`. Maybe there are other reasons why a `ValueError` can be raised. And it might also make sense to replace `except ValueError` by `except Exception`.

No. Here is the code of `_check_valid()`:

```
    def _check_valid(self):
        """
        Check that this object is valid, i.e., the session in which this
        object is defined is still running. This is relevant for
        interpreters that can't be interrupted via ctrl-C, hence get
        restarted.
        """
        try:
            P = self.parent()
            if P is None:
                raise ValueError("The %s session in which this object was defined is no longer running."%P.name())
        except AttributeError:
            raise ValueError("The session in which this object was defined is no longer running.")
        return P
```
So, catching the ValueError is exactly the same as saying "the session is no longer running or some noob overrode `Element.parent` by something that raises a ValueError and thus the whole interface is broken anyway.

Currently `eval` and `get` have a different semantics, which I tried to explain in the documentation that I added. The reason to introduce `_get_primitive` is performance: If doing `MyInterface.eval('1')` returns `''` then you need a print statement, such as `MyInterface.eval('print(1)')`. However, if you are in an interface such as Gap or Singular then the print statement is not needed, and of course it is a bit faster to not use the print statement.

Thus, for *efficiency*, the default is to not use the print statement, but for an interface that needs the print statement you are able to override the default.

By the way, how do I use the exception message? If I do

```
    except ValueError, msg:
```
then `"no longer" in msg` doesn't work (ValueError has no `__contains__` method) and `"no longer" in msg.message` gives a DeprecationWarning.

So, am I really supposed to do `"no longer" in repr(msg)`? Or did you mean I should let the `__repr__` method return `'(invalid {} object - {})'.format(self.parent() or type(self), msg)`?

> Maybe there are other reasons why a `ValueError` can be raised. And it might also make sense to replace `except ValueError` by `except Exception`.


I was taught by several people to not catch a general `Exception` (in contrast to a more specific type of error) unless it is absolutely clear that I do not want that exception to be propagated. And that's not the case here. If a different error occurs then I don't want to hide it.

I already answered that. I was bitten by name mangling. While

```
sage: r = singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: M = singular.matrix(2,2,"(25/47*x^2*y^4 + 63/127*x + 27)^3,y,0,1")
sage: M.rename('T')
sage: M.__custom_name
'T'
```
does work, `hasattr(self,'__custom_name')` returned `False` when I had it in the `_repr_` method.

But if you use `self.__custom_name` in the same module in which the private attribute is defined (namely `sage.structure.sage_object`) then there is no point to use the accessor method, as it is slower.

Just to be on the safe side (maybe I had a typo such as `hasattr(self,'__custon_name')`?), I'll try to change it into using `self.__custom_name?` and tell you what happens.

If you need the print statement then use the (already existing) method `.get()`, not `.eval()`. The same applies to Singular:

```
sage: r = singular.ring(0,'(x,y)','dp')
sage: M = singular.matrix(2,2,"(25/47*x^2*y^4 + 63/127*x + 27)^3,y,0,1")
sage: singular.eval(M._name)

I am getting more and more lost here...

Given what you just said, what's the difference between `get()` and `_get_primitive()`?

For Singular and Gap, `_get_primitive()` does the same as `eval()`, which is fine because primitives (such as integers) in Gap or Singular do not need to be printed in order to get their string representations. So, blindly using `get()` has a small performance effect.

However, note that this ticket is a dependency for #22452. And in Polymake, you need an explicit print statement even for primitives; thus, blindly using `eval()` wouldn't do the right thing.

Hence, it is needed to introduce a hook `_get_primitive` to customise it.

The default, I think, should cover the **most frequent** case. So far, Polymake is the only interface I am aware of that would need a print statement to show an integer. That's why I chose it to default to `eval()`, which works for...

```
sage: gp.eval('1')
'1'

'1'
sage: gap.eval('1')
'1'
sage: maxima.eval('1')
'1'
```
whereas you will have (with #22452)

```
sage: polymake.eval('1')
''
```

No, I think the default should cover the case which makes it least likely to make mistakes.

I also think that many interfaces have custom `get()` methods but don't really need it. For example, GP has a custom `get()` method calling `print()` but I don't see how GP would treat variables differently from "primitive" objects.

Also, it is mentally a lot easier to understand if `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`. Until all your extra explanations I found it hard to understand what `_get_primitive()` is about. If you say that `_get_primitive()` is just an optimization for `get()`, then it makes a lot of sense that `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`.

It does treat them differently:

```
sage: M = random_matrix(ZZ,3,3)
sage: m = gp(M); n = gp(15)
sage: gp.get(m._name), gp.get(n._name)
('[0, -1, 2; 2, -12, 0; -2, 1, 2]', '15')
sage: gp.eval(m._name), gp.eval(n._name)

```

Apparently the creator of the interface thought that the latter result is nicer than the former.

> Also, it is mentally a lot easier to understand if `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`. Until all your extra explanations I found it hard to understand what `_get_primitive()` is about. If you say that `_get_primitive()` is just an optimization for `get()`, then it makes a lot of sense that `_get_primitive()` would default to `get()`.


__First proposition:__ `_get_primitive_` should be used in the default comparison method.

__Rationale:__ Using `eval()` in the default comparison means I'll have to override the comparison method in the Polymake interface (doable of course, but I'd like to avoid it). Using `get()` means to lose performance of comparison (thus, an important operation) in all other interfaces.

__Second proposition:__ If `_get_primitive_` is used in comparison methods, it should default to `eval`.

__Rationale:__ If instead it would default to `get`, I'd need to override the default in ALL existing interfaces, or I would have to live with a performance loss in comparison.

__Counterargument:__ I do override `_get_primitive` in Polymake mainly in order to avoid overriding `__cmp__` (I also use it in helper methods, but they are cached and thus using `get()` is fine there). Hence, why do I introduce `_get_primitive` and override it in Polymake, rather than I change the helper methods to use `get()` and then override `__cmp__` in Polymake?

You mean that the former

```
[0, -1, 2; 2, -12, 0; -2, 1, 2]
```
is nicer than the latter

```
[ 0  -1 2]

[ 2 -12 0]

[-2   1 2]
```

I think it depends a lot on the application. If the output of `get()` is supposed to be machine-readable, then certainly the former is nicer.

I did this in the current commit, and I changed the ticket description to say that I believe the mentioned functions "could be removed, but not on this ticket".

So, I guess that means "needs review" again.

Anyway, the interfaces themselves inherit from parent, the objects represented in the interface inherit from element. And that means it should be single underscore, as a rule of thumb.

I didn't intend to do whitespace changes, however my editor (geany) is configured to change tabs into four blanks and to remove trailing whitespace when saving a file.

How should I proceed? Shall I rewrite history, force-push and then rebase #22452 on top of it? Or shall I add a commit that re-introduces the whitespace (probably not)?

So the editor is the culprit?

I said "I didn't *intend* to...". So, the fact that I have this option by default is a good when creating a new file, but bad when editing an existing file that doesn't conform to the standards that sage has regarding trailing whitespace.

Why?

You should not force-push here and then base #22452. Instead, you should force-push #22452, checkout the commit corresponding to this ticket and force-push that.

That's very easy to do.

No. If I understand things correctly, #22452 contains the commit from this ticket (#22501). So you could rebase #22452 but keeping a separation between the commits which really belong to #22501 and the ones which really belong to #22452 (so not squashing everything together).

Yes, it does.

> So you could rebase #22452 but keeping a separation between the commits which really belong to #22501 and the ones which really belong to #22452 (so not squashing everything together).


That's why I suggested to force a change here and then rebase the commits that really belong to #22452 on top of the new forced commit from here (#22501).

> Then you can force-push #22452. At this point, the branch from #22501 will no longer be a sub-branch of #22452. But that can be fixed by resetting the branch on #22501 to a commit which was pushed on #22452.


It seems to me that the result is equivalent to what I suggest.

So, my plan now is:

- Create a new single commit for this ticket (#22501) that removes trailing whitespace only in the lines that have also been edited for other reasons.
- Force-push the new commit here.
- Rebase the commits from #22452 that really belong to #22452 on top of the new commit. Push (of course using force) the result there.
