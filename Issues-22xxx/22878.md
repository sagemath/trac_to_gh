For bernmm, I agree that module.py is the right place to do it.
In fact we should definitely split back bernmm into a separate package.

I think it should be added in the place which causes the dependency. For example, ECL depends on GMP, so it makes sense that every module which uses `ecl.pxd` should link against `gmp`.

I would *not* add to `module_list.py`. Ideally, `module_list.py` should not exist in the first place. It's much cleaner to add the `# distutils` declarations in the Cython source file.
