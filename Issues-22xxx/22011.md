but configuring the giac spkg with --disable-nls was successfull on osx 10.12 so I suggest the following diff:

<a id='comment:14'></a>On fedora 25 amd64 I was able to build sage with

```
export MAKE='make -j3'
make
```
At the end giac was also built. I could run

```
make ptestlong
```  
then I could run

```
env SAGE_CHECK=yes make giacpy
```
On osx 10.12 I could built sage with make but something was missing psutil:

```
[sagelib-7.5.beta5] sys	0m1.710s
cd ../.. && sage-logger -p './sage --docbuild --no-pdf-links all html ' logs/dochtml.log
[dochtml] /Users/frederichan/dev/sage/local/bin/python: No module named psutil; 'sage_setup.docbuild' is a package and cannot be directly executed
make[2]: *** [doc-html] Error 1
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
```
so I made

```
make psutil
```
then I could build sage successfully, and giac was built. As it seems unreliated to giac I give a positive review
