Implement a custom `create_extension()` function for Cython. This new function does some things which were done in `setup.py` in different places, but now have one dedicated place. It should also fix the problem where `-std=c99` is used for a C++ extension, which is an error for Clang. Also duplicate flags (like `-msse -mmse`) are removed.

This requires an upstream patch https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/466

-Implement a custom `create_extension()` function for Cython. This new function does some things which were done in `setup.py` in different places, but now have one dedicated place. It should also fix the problem where `-std=c99` is used for a C++ extension. Also duplicate flags (like `-msse -mmse`) are removed.

Just to be clear: I assume you mean with `SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no`, otherwise Sage will build and use GCC anyway.

That the patch from the linked github pull request should be applied to the Cython sources. In this case, the patch is added as `build/pkgs/cython/patches/create_extension.patch` and the Cython version number is bumped to force rebuilding Cython with that patch.
