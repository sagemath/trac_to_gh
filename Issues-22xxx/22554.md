Implement a custom `create_extension()` function for Cython. This new function does some things which were done in `setup.py` in different places, but now have one dedicated place. It should also fix the problem where `-std=c99` is used for a C++ extension, which is an error for Clang. Also duplicate flags (like `-msse -mmse`) are removed.

This requires an upstream patch https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/466

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

What does "This requires an upstream patch" mean? That it should be applied to the upstream tarball?

(in fact one does not seem to need it to be applied to Sage, so this probably needs to be clarified in the ticket description)

That the patch from the linked github pull request should be applied to the Cython sources. In this case, the patch is added as `build/pkgs/cython/patches/create_extension.patch` and the Cython version number is bumped to force rebuilding Cython with that patch.
