Implement a custom `create_extension()` function for Cython. This new function does some things which were done in `setup.py` in different places, but now have one dedicated place. It should also fix the problem where `-std=c99` is used for a C++ extension, which is an error for Clang. Also duplicate flags (like `-msse -mmse`) are removed.

This requires an upstream patch https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/466

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Reviewer: Dima Pasechnik

Author: Jeroen Demeyer

Resolution: fixed
