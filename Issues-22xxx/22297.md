I looked at your branch and it is wrong because it happens *after* coercion. There is no guarantee that the result of coercion will be Sage elements.

oh ! really ? I thought that when things have a parent, they are elements. Would you
have an example where this is not the case ?

Other possibilities that come to my mind : what would you think of replacing "`cmp(left, right)`" by "`left.__cmp__(right)`" (I have not yet tried if it works) ? or maybe by "`raise TypeError('coercion should build members of Element class')`" ?

This is one of the latest calls to cmp() in a cython file. I would really like to be able to cythonize all the pxy files with python3.

Do you remember how many failures there are, and where ? how many classes are concerned by this bad double semantic ? I would suspect that this happens at least in symbolic ring and real numbers. This may also be the cause of the problems in #22257.

Of course. That's trivially true, since a parent is a concept which was invented for the `Element`/`Parent` classes.

> Would you have an example where this is not the case ?

Not right away, but I know that it's possible.

> Other possibilities that come to my mind : what would you think of replacing "`cmp(left, right)`" by "`left.__cmp__(right)`"

I don't really like that, but this might be the least bad thing to do.

Certainly not this.

some of the problems (including the ones in Coxeter groups and heegner.py) reduces to the following one:

```
sage: A1=QuadraticField(5)
sage: A2=QuadraticField(5)
sage: A1==A2
False
```
or the existing doctest

```
QuadraticField(-11, 'a') is QuadraticField(-11, 'a')
```
In turn, this seems to come from problems in RealLazyField.

```
from sage.rings.number_field.number_field import NumberFieldFactory
nff = NumberFieldFactory("number_field_factory")
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
a1=nff.create_object(None, (QQ, x^2 -2, ('a',), RLF(sqrt(2)), None, None, False, None), check=False)
a2=nff.create_object(None, (QQ, x^2 -2, ('a',), RLF(sqrt(2)), None, None, False, None), check=False)
a1 == a2
```
where the failure of equality comes from the RLF terms.
