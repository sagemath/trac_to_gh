That's not how it works.  *You* have to explain me why the change that you made makes sense. And "no doctest fail" is never a good explanation.

I'm not even saying that the change is wrong, but it certainly needs to be justified.

oh ! really ? I thought that when things have a parent, they are elements. Would you
have an example where this is not the case ?

Other possibilities that come to my mind : what would you think of replacing "`cmp(left, right)`" by "`left.__cmp__(right)`" (I have not yet tried if it works) ? or maybe by "`raise TypeError('coercion should build members of Element class')`" ?

This is one of the latest calls to cmp() in a cython file. I would really like to be able to cythonize all the pxy files with python3.

Of course. That's trivially true, since a parent is a concept which was invented for the `Element`/`Parent` classes.

> Would you have an example where this is not the case ?

Not right away, but I know that it's possible.

> Other possibilities that come to my mind : what would you think of replacing "`cmp(left, right)`" by "`left.__cmp__(right)`"


I don't really like that, but this might be the least bad thing to do.

> "`raise TypeError('coercion should build members of Element class')`" ?


Certainly not this.

OK, I have an example: the coercion of `RealField(54)(1)` and `float(1.0)` gives a `float`.

This *might* be considered a bug though...

<a id='comment:25'></a>some of the problems (including the ones in Coxeter groups and heegner.py) reduces to the following one:

```
sage: A1=QuadraticField(5)
sage: A2=QuadraticField(5)
sage: A1==A2
False
```
or the existing doctest

```
QuadraticField(-11, 'a') is QuadraticField(-11, 'a')
```
In turn, this seems to come from problems in RealLazyField.

```
from sage.rings.number_field.number_field import NumberFieldFactory
nff = NumberFieldFactory("number_field_factory")
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
a1=nff.create_object(None, (QQ, x^2 -2, ('a',), RLF(sqrt(2)), None, None, False, None), check=False)
a2=nff.create_object(None, (QQ, x^2 -2, ('a',), RLF(sqrt(2)), None, None, False, None), check=False)
a1 == a2
```
where the failure of equality comes from the RLF terms.
