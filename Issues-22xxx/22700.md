```
var('n')
limit(harmonic_number(n)/n,n=+oo,algorithm='sympy')
```

gives zero, which isn't obtainable without it.  There are more such examples - put lots of sympy limit stuff in, and perhaps not just under limit but e.g. under the definition of harmonic number.  I'll point out that some of their documentation is pretty nice at e.g. http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/functions/combinatorial.html#harmonic
