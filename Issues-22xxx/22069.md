This has been reported on 
[AskSM](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/35774/coefficients-of-series/).

At least in some cases coefficients() does not return the leading coefficient. 

Example:
    g = lambda x, n: (1 + x<sup>2</sup>)<sup>n</sup> + n*x*(1 + x<sup>2</sup>)^(n - 1)^

    g(x,4).series(x,12).coefficients()
Returns:
    [ [1, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [12, 3], [6, 4], [12, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7] ]
Compare with the deprecated coeffs() which returns correct values:
    [ [1, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [12, 3], [6, 4], [12, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7], [1, 8] ]

Just a hint, to expand expressions as `g(x,4)` you better use `expand` instead of `series`. The bug seems associated with truncated series so this is also a workaround.
