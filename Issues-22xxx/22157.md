If I understand well, your first objective is to have a method returning a `SPQR-tree`, but you don't need this method to be fast and you are not planning yet to implement best possible method. This is perfectly understandable and in such case we need to add a warning or todo flag explaining that a faster algorithm could be implemented.

some remarks:

In method `twosplit` you can avoid calling twice `vertex_connectivity`. First call `cut_size,cut_vertices = self.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False)` and then check if `cut_size != 2`.

In method `spqr_tree`, you can avoid a call to `vertex_connectivity` doing `if not self.is_connected() and len(self.blocks_and_cut_vertices()[1]) > 0: ...`.

We can certainly make a small method to check that `A` is a cycle. For instance `if A.order()==A.size() and min(A.degree())==max(A.degree() and A.is_connected()` ? Unfortunately, no such method has been added to `graph_classes` yet.

You don't need to call `GraphGenerators.EmptyGraph()`. You can call directly `Graph(multiedges=True)` if you want to allow multi edges.

Instead of `e in SPR[i].edges(labels = False)` you could test `SPR[i].has_edge(e)`. Many times.

Some proposals to improve method `twosplit`.
* the name of the method is not appropriate. It should be at least `two_split` or something more clear
* You can use method `self._scream_if_not_simple()` to avoid adding your own tests.
* `virtual_edge = (cut_vertices[0],cut_vertices[1])` -> `virtual_edge = tuple(cut_vertices)`
* Instead of `H = self.subgraph(vertices = [v for v in self.vertices() if v not in cut_vertices])` you can do the following which should be slightly faster: 

```
H = Graph(self.edges(labels=False))
H.delete_vertices(cut_vertices)
```
* In loop `for K in CC:...` you can do that, thus saving a useless creation of a subgraph (graph copies and taking subgraph can be a long operation):

```
    cut_sides = []
    for K in CC:
        for u in cut_vertices:
            K.add_edges([(u,v) for v in self.neighbor_iterator(u) if v in K])
        K.allow_multiple_edges(True) ## why do we need that ???
        if not K.has_edge(virtual_edge):
            K.add_edge(virtual_edge)
        cut_sides.append(K)
```
* The loop `for i in range(Comps + 1): cocycles.add_edge(virtual_edge)` could be replaced with `cocycles.add_edges([virtual_edge]*(Comps+1))`. Very similar in fact.
* Also, do not hesitate to add an empty line between important blocs of code/comments to ease the readability.


Overall, the method should be something like that:

```
    from sage.graphs.graph import Graph
    self._scream_if_not_simple()

    cut_size,cut_vertices = self.vertex_connectivity(value_only = False)
    if cut_size != 2:
        raise NotImplementedError("twosplit is only implemented on graphs with vertex connectivity 2")

    H = Graph(self.edges(labels=False))
    H.delete_vertices(cut_vertices)

    virtual_edge = tuple(cut_vertices)    
    CC = H.connected_components_subgraphs()
    Comps = len(CC)

    # deletion of separating pair leaves connected components;
    # we add to each of those components a virtual edge
    # between the separating pair and restore edges incident to them
    cut_sides = []
    for K in CC:
        for u in cut_vertices:
            K.add_edges([(u,v) for v in self.neighbor_iterator(u) if v in K])
        K.allow_multiple_edges(True) ## why ???
        if not K.has_edge(virtual_edge):
            K.add_edge(virtual_edge)
        cut_sides.append(K)

    # if the original graph has an edge between the separating pair
    # of vertices, a bond with one edge more than the number of 
    # auxiliary graphs is needed for re-assembly
    cocycles = Graph(multiedges=True)
    if self.has_edge(virtual_edge):
        cocycles.add_edges([virtual_edge]*(Comps+1))

    # if the original graph has no edge between the separating pair
    # of vertices but deletion of the separating pair leaves
    # more than two components, a bond with one edge per component
    # is needed for re-assembly
    elif Comps > 2:
        cocycles.add_edges([virtual_edge]*Comps)

    return cut_sides,cocycles,virtual_edge
```

Of course, the modifications I proposed are not helpful to speed up the code. We need a palm-tree and the appropriate algorithm for that...

Your patch does not pass tests.
In the multigraph example, you must add `multiedges=True`, so

```
sage: G = Graph({0:[1,1,1,2,3],1:[4,5],2:[3,3],3:[5],4:[5],6:[2,4],7:[2,2,4,4]}, multiedges=True)
```

Furthermore, have you checked that the returned solutions are correct ?
In the subgraphs, some multiple edges are presents but some are missing.

```
sage: G = Graph({0:[1,1,1,2,3],1:[4,5],2:[3,3],3:[5],4:[5],6:[2,4],7:[2,2,4,4]}, multiedges=True)
sage: S,C,f = G.cleave()
sage: for g in S:
....:     print(g.edges(labels=0))
....: 
[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
[(2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 6)]
[(2, 4), (2, 7), (4, 7)]
```

I do prefer the following example, easier to check:

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(2,3)
sage: G.add_edge(2, 3)
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: G.add_edges(G.edges())
sage: S,C,f = G.cleave()
sage: for g in S:
....:     print(g.edges(labels=0))
....:     
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 3)]
[(0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 4)]
```
It seems the problem is with multiple edges incident to a cut vertex.

Yes, there are few edges missing in `S` because we are adding only one edge in a component between `u` and cut vertex even if there are multiple edges between them. Please see below.

```
for u in cut_vertices:
    component.add_edges([(u,v) for v in G.neighbor_iterator(u) if v in componentVertices])
```
\\
Shall I iterate over cut vertices edges using `G.edge_iterator` and add edges like below.

```
for u in cut_vertices:
    component.add_edges([(u,e[1]) for e in G.edge_iterator(u) if e[1] in componentVertices])
```
Or is there any better way to find number of multiple edges between `u` and `v`. \\
\\
I feel the `cocycles` if there is an edge between the separating pair then it should be like

```
cocycles.add_edges([virtual_edge]*(Comps+(number of multiple edges between cutvertices)))
```
Please let me know if I am wrong.

You can do directly:

```
component.add_edges([e for e in G.edge_iterator(vertex=cut_vertices) if e[0] in componentVertices or e[1] in componentVertices])
```

Good question. In fact, it might be even more. Indeed, you create a list of subgraphs, each corresponding to the vertices of a connected component in the graph minus the cut vertices, plus the cut vertices and edges between them.
Hence, if we have 2 edges between the cut vertices, we must also have 2 edges between these vertices in each subgraph.

Consequently, the cocycle contains `(#comps + 1) * (number of multiple edges between cutvertices)` edges when we have edges between the cut vertices and `#comps` otherwise. 


Do not forget to correct all minor issues in the method like `if `G` is a biconnected..` -> `If `G` is a biconnected..`, in the description of the output you must say that `C` is `cocylcles`, etc.

Sorry, I am unable to understand, does it means if `G` has 3 edges between cut vertices then each connected component of H(after removing cut vertices in G) should have 3 virtual edges between cut vertices?

If no edge between cut vertices in G, it's clear, (#comps).

It took sometime for updating it to latest beta version.\\
\\
I am using a variable `multiedges_bw_cutvertices` which stores the number of multiple edges between cut vertices in `G` and it's used to add number of virtual edges to each component.\\
The previous version add only one virtual edge.

```
if not component.has_edge(virtual_edge):
    component.add_edges([virtual_edge]*multiedges_bw_cutvertices)
```

I am unable to understand why `cocycles` a dipole graph is not define when the connected components are 2? (Unable to find the supporting point)

```
elif Comps > 2:
    cocycles.add_edges([virtual_edge]*Comps)
```

Do these examples are enough or we need to add more examples for cleave function?

In the next commit I will be updating spqr_tree function.

I don't understand the question. Please give a clear example

> In the next commit I will be updating spqr_tree function. 

OK
\\

You can get the number of edges between cut vertices as 

```
if self.has_edge(virtual_edge):
   if self.has_multiple_edges():
      multiedges_bw_cutvertices = len(self.edge_label(cut_vertices[0],cut_vertices[1]))
   else:
      multiedges_bw_cutvertices = 1
else:
   multiedges_bw_cutvertices = 0
```

Do `component.allow_multiple_edges(True)` before adding edges to the component. Otherwise, multiedges will not be added

Please see below lines.

        if self.has_edge(virtual_edge):

When we have connected components = 2 and `G` has no virtual edge then it neither enters in if condition nor in else condition. End up by returning an empty list for `cocycle`. is it correct? \\

If the number of connected components is 2 and there is not virtual edge present in `G`

1. Cleave function is defined initially, knowing that input is always simple biconnected graph.
2. As `A` is always simple according to `split_multiple_edges` algorithm in the reference paper, I feel there is no need to add `B.allow_multiple_edges(False)`.
3. Currently, all the cycles are pushed to polygons(S-Block) but what if a cycle is tri connected i.e a triangle. I feel it need to be in `R-Block` instead of `S-Block`. Correct me, If I am wrong.

4. According to `Theorem 1` in reference paper, the number of nodes in Tree need to be equal to the number of tri-connected components and the edges between nodes u,v exit only if the components u and v share the common edge. The current implementation is adding all the required edges and the generated tree seems to be correct, yet not found a counter case yet.
Is there any simple way to verify the output tree?
\\ 
\\
5. I tried with few examples.

```
G = Graph({1:[2,3], 3:[2, 5], 2:[4], 6:[4,5]})
G = Graph({0:[1,2,3],1:[4,5],2:[3],3:[5],4:[5],6:[2,4]})
# Refernce Paper graph
G = Graph({1:[2, 4, 8, 12, 13], 2:[1, 3, 13], 3:[2, 4, 13], 4:[1, 3, 7, 5], 5:[4, 6, 7, 8], 6:[5, 7], 7:[4, 5, 6], 8:[1, 5, 9, 11, 12], 9:[8, 10, 11, 12], 10:[9, 11, 12], 11:[8, 9, 10], 12:[1, 8, 9, 10]})
```
AFAIK, the output seems to be correct.
Please let me know the case in which it's giving an incorrect answer.
6. There is a minor change in the `cleave function`, multiedges_bw_cutvertices -> num_virtual_edge_add, my bad I gave initially the incorrect name. 
`num_virtual_edge_add` says the number of virtual edges needs to be added to a component.

Please test on this spqr-tree function and there is a minor change in the output definition.
Previous it return `(R,S,P,SPR,SPQR-tree)` \\
Now it return      `(R,S,P,SPR,tricomp,SPQR-tree)` \\
Tri-Component is a list of tri-components from R and S block. As S-Block contains the only polygon so there is only one case in which a component is a cycle and tri-connected is Triangle.

- In `cleave`, the error message `"G must be a biconnected graph."` is not appropriate. It can be used only if you test `if cut_size < 2`. But when `cut_size > 2`, it is better to say `"G has no 2-vertex cut"`  (without dot at the end of the sentence)

Yes, followed by G.spqr_tree()[0],  G.spqr_tree()[1] will give us a empty set as other components are tri-connected and covered in R-Block. \\

G = Graph({0:[1,2],3:[1,2],4:[1,2],5:[1,2],6:[1,2]}) will give similar results if triangles are added to R-Block instead of S-block i.e polygon blocks.
Currently, it's giving an empty list to R-block(G.spqr_tree()[0]) and all triangles to S-Block(G.spqr_tree()[1]).

Yes it doesn't look good and convey less information. \\
Any suggestion where I can find the document related to it or we can reduce this message in the code? \\
Tried searching in developer's  Guide  couldn't find a related doc.

With the help of 3 K_4 example and this, 2 good examples are covered.

```
sage: G = Graph(2)
sage: for i in range(3):
....:     G.add_clique([0, 1, G.add_vertex(), G.add_vertex()])
sage: R,S,P,SPR,tricomp,SPQR_tree = G.spqr_tree()
sage: CG4 = graphs.CompleteGraph(4)
sage: all(h.is_isomorphic(CG4) for h in R)
True
```
I will update it in next commit.

One example for multiple edges, 

```
sage: G = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(2,3)
sage: G.add_edge(2, 3)            
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: G.add_edges(G.edges())
sage: G.add_edges([[0,1],[0,1],[0,1]])
sage: R,S,P,SPR,tricomp,SPQR-tree = G.spqr_tree()
sage: tricomp
[Subgraph of (): Multi-graph on 3 vertices,
 Subgraph of (): Multi-graph on 4 vertices]
```
With different order of tri-connected components.

I bet that `self.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False)` is one of the most time consuming operation. That's why we need the implementation of the linear time algorithm.

The most import in this patch is to get a working method. It will be very useful for testing the linear time code.

Yes, it's taking much time for graphs which has order > 2000 and size > 40000.
Mostly the time is taken by vertex_connectivity function and some other component depending on graph.(cases are less)
\\
To reduce memory usage, I am deleting few variables after usage. 

After doing few runs with different graphs, I kept flags to find running time for below 5 parts.
1. Vertex_connectivity
2. Split_multiple_edge(4711 to 4730)
3. cleave and appending cuts (4734 to 4761)
4. appending blocks (4769 to 4806)
5. Construction of Tree (4812 to 4843)

vertex_connectiviy is taking more time when there are multiple edges in input graph. So I am pushing, Split_multiple_edges as the first step(if graph has multiple edges) as split_mutiple_edge will give output as a simple version of G. if there are x cut points in multigraph then they should be x cut points in a simple graph too. correct me if I am wrong.

There is a significant difference in running time of vertex_connectivity function if we do above change, atleast code running time is down with 1/2 when there are multiple edges in input graph.

I will upload the result file mostly by tomorrow night. Some test cases are pending.

This is surprizing. In the ILP formulation, multiple edges only lead to adding multiple times the same constraint, but then solver quickly remove redundant constraints.

Don't do that ! ;)

What is `split_multiple_edges` doing ? If it split an edge into a path, it introduce a new vertex of degree 2, and so a new cut with 2 vertices.

Really weird. Isn't it due to extra computation like a copy of the graph ?

Please have a look at the second table in the attached file. 

In which I used two graph G1 with order = 3502 and size = 8751 and G2 with order = 5002 and size = 12501. later I am adding multiple edges to G1 and G2.
There is an increase in running time of Vertex Connectivity
but the difference is significant, please let me know if this kind of nature is expected.

`split_multiple_edges` in this part bundle of multiple edges are replaced by a new virtual edge. This step is done only to make graph simple from multi.
It's reference is present in section 4.1 of the reference paper.

It's not going add any new vertex.

I am finding how much time it's taking to execute `self.vertex_connectivity(value_only = False)` this step.
Let me know if I missed something.

Results.2.csv is same as Results.csv
\\
Table 1 has all multigraphs, it's intended to show which component is taking time if multiple edges are more.
\\
I wanted to generate a graph which shows running time vs memory consumption couldn't complete it.
\\
I used Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v4 processor, which has 2.40GHz frequency. To generate the running time.

I did some tests

```
sage: G = Graph(2)
sage: for i in range(1000):G.add_clique([0, 1, G.add_vertex(), G.add_vertex()])
sage: H = Graph(G.edges()+G.edges(), multiedges=True)
sage: %timeit a,b = G.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False, solver='Cplex')
1 loop, best of 3: 458 ms per loop
sage: %timeit a,b = H.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False, solver='Cplex')
1 loop, best of 3: 639 ms per loop
sage: %timeit a,b = G.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False, solver='GLPK')
1 loop, best of 3: 8.71 s per loop
sage: %timeit a,b = H.vertex_connectivity(value_only=False, solver='GLPK')
1 loop, best of 3: 15.3 s per loop
```
I also checked more closely adding parameter `verbose=3`.

With `Cplex`, the difference in running time is mostly in the time needed to write the ILP, and then in the elimination of rows/columns. So the difference is small.
With `GLPK`, I have the feeling that it does not eliminate rows/columns, and so is very long.

Anyway, we knew that `vertex_connectivity` is slow and that it takes most of the computing time of the method. So don't waste more time trying to optimize the running time of this method. It will be slow. The most important is that it is safe = it gives the correct result.

I feel for 1000 nodes if it's taking ms is reasonable time. Ultimately it need to preform good when graph is simple but it's taking time for it too.

> Anyway, we knew that `vertex_connectivity` is slow and that it takes most of the computing time of the method. So don't waste more time trying to optimize the running time of this method. It will be slow. The most important is that it is safe = it gives the correct result.

The overall contribution of vertex_connectivity is to check whether the graph is bi-connected or not. if we mention the input need to be biconnected then we can remove the `vertex_connectivity`  or we can use `is_biconnected()`. \\
Again `vertex_connectivity` is used in `Cleave` a helper function of spqr_tree, the input to Cleave function is a simple subgraph. Its time is comparatively less if we see in Results.csv

Not only. We want to check if the graph has a 2-vertex-cut or not.

In particular, the `cleave` method is used to split a biconnected graph along a 2-vertex cut, if it has one.

> if we mention the input need to be biconnected then we can remove the `vertex_connectivity`  or we can use `is_biconnected()`. \\


Where ? in `cleave`, we need to find the 2-vertex-cuts.

Deleting SG might lead to an error. Understand that when you append SG to `twoblocks`, you don't copy the full object, you just append a pointer to SG. Hopeful, when you do `del SG` it apparently only deletes the pointer, not the full object. So please don't do that !

To give you an example:

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: L = []
sage: L.append(G)
sage: G.add_edge(0, 1)
sage: L[0].edges()
[(0, 1, None)]
```
 

Concerning `del twoblocks`, since the list is empty at that time, the memory occupancy is negligeable, so there is no need to do that.

I don't understand what you want to show. What is important is to give a valid vertex cut of the graph. You may add an example with more vertices than needed if you want, but I'm not sure it's so interesting here.

Thanks for clearing it, I thought the change in `SG` should not effect in `twoblocks`.
so we can delete it. 
Before keeping `del SG`, I did below test.

```
sage: G = Graph([[0,1]])
sage: l = []
sage: l.append(G)
sage: G
Graph on 2 vertices
sage: l
[Graph on 2 vertices]
sage: del G
sage: G
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-96e89ba817df> in <module>()
----> 1 G

NameError: name 'G' is not defined
sage: l
[Graph on 2 vertices]
sage: l[0].add_edge(2,3)
sage: l
[Graph on 4 vertices]

```
This gives me thought that `G` and `l` doesn't have any link between them and both have independent memory location, so why to keep `G` when we have its instance in `l` but actually, it's appending links and deleting link i.e `SG` doesn't make sense and doesn't affect memory usage.

I want to show that the cut vertices(passing values when calling the function) could differ(in size too) from the generated output of `vertex_connectivity`, as we have enough examples may this is not a good example.

I have added `P_block_new` for test.
Example: 

```
sage: from sage.graphs.connectivity import spqr_tree
....: G = Graph()
....: G.add_cycle(vertices=[0,1,2,3,4])
....: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
....: G.add_edges(G.edges())
....: G.add_edge(2,3)
....: G.add_edge(3,4)
....: 
sage: R,S,P,SPR,tricomp,SPQR_tree,P_new = spqr_tree(G)
sage: P==P_new
True

```
In the next commit, I will update the comments and add a return statement `if SG.is_cycle():`.

I will try to add in the next commit. I am not yet good at writing formally.

Yes we can do this, 
R will be `[]` \\
S will be `SG` \\
P_block will be the components formed by combining multiple edges in `cocycle`. there are two ways to do it. \\
1. Make components by adding multiple edges. \\
2. Make multigraph using `cocycle` edges then extract subgraphs using `cuts`. \\
I feel option 1 is slightly better than option 2, let me know which option is better.

It's a verification step used to check whether all the cycles are formed using `cocycle` edges. \\
Initially, I thought we can skip this step as there is no case in which cycle will be formed without using `cocycle` edge but I am not 100% sure.

We can remove `SPR` block as it's addition of previous 3 variables, `R_blocks + polygons + P_blocks`. \\

Assume that the nodes of the SPQR-tree are (immutable) multi-graphs and not subsets of vertices. If I give you only the SPQR-tree, we should be able to reconstruct the original graph, right ? So are other outputs necessary ?

Updated SPQR_Tree vertices with subgraphs and added tree construction along with P_Block part for `SG` cycle case. \\
Let me know this is the right way to do. \\
From this, we need to return only `Tree` and not need to return other blocks.\\
Still, subgraph vertices are there in SPQR_Tree it's for testing which will be removed.

Yes, `SG` will be a cycle if `G` is a cycle with few multi edges but in SPQR-Tree I feel we will have morethan one vertex because `G` is multi-graph so some edges will be added to `cocycle` which will lead to creation of `P_Block`(P vertices). \\

`return Graph({('S', Graph(G, immutable=True, multiedges=G.has_multiple_edges())`. \\
This is true when `G` is cycle with `n - 1` edges. So no edges will contribute in creation of `P_Block`. \\

correct me if I am wrong.

Yes, it can be a leaf node.

Yes, it will be a separator if it's an internal vertex.

```
        sage: G = graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(2,3)
        sage: G.add_edge(2, 3)
        sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
        sage: G.add_edges(G.edges())

        sage: R,S,P,SPR,tricomp,SPQR_tree,tree_new = spqr_tree(G)
```
In the above example some `P` elements are acting as leaf and some as internal vertex(a seperator).

With what I did, you can do (don't add a third edge between 0 and 1 in this example. There is an error in `is_clique`: #25696):

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)], multiedges=True)
sage: spqr_tree(G)
SPQR-tree of : Graph on 2 vertices
sage: spqr_tree(G).edges()
[(('P', Multi-graph on 2 vertices), ('S', Multi-graph on 4 vertices), None)]
```
I think the code is simpler and we return only what we need = the SPQR tree. Do you agree or you think something is missing ?



At some point, we will need a function that reconstruct a graph from a SPQR tree.

No. I expect the SPQR tree to have 1 P block and 3 S blocks. We have more, meaning that the merging of cycles is not well done.

Yes, it's okay now, on the last version, I found only two counter case, in which the number of `S` and `P` block is (4, 2) which is expected to be (9, 8), verified by OGDF code. this occurred on the example graph provided by Hopcroft paper, that 4 S components are found by breaking 2 squares into 4 triangles by using 2 cut edges. But the current version is giving the correct answer now. \\
The second example was on a graph which is formed by combining 4 cycles of length 4, in which the previous version was giving 0 `S components` and the current version is giving the correct answer.

>

Added the reference paper example to `spqr_tree_to_graph` function, it's the same graph on which the last version failed. \\
And a very minor change in `spqr_tree` examples.

For the below graph there is a miss match in OGDF output and current version.
for Graph,

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: G.add_edges([(0, 2), (0, 2)])
sage: T = spqr_tree(G)
sage: T.vertices()
[('R', Cycle graph: Multi-graph on 4 vertices)]
```
OGDF says it should have 2 `S components` and 2 `P components`. but both seems to be correct. 
Except for this example, I feel everything is fine.

You should add the link using `:wikipedia:`SPQR_tree``

> And a very minor change in `spqr_tree` examples.


Why did you change this way ?

```
-        sage: all(u[1].is_isomorphic(K4) for u in Tree.vertices() if u[0] == 'R')
+        sage: all(u[1].is_isomorphic(K4) for u in Tree.vertices() if u[0] == 'S')
```
 a K4 is 3 connected, so it is a 'R' block, not a 'S' block.

It's due to `is_clique`, as reported in #25696. The graph has 4 vertices and 6 edges...

You can rebase this ticket on top of #25696 and add the dependency. Then the example should work properly.

Yes, it should be `R` not `S`, as S contains cycles. my mistake.

Ok, I understood now.

I was using the following example of a cycle on `5` vertices to test the parameter `virtual_edges`:

```
G = Graph()
G.add_edges([(1,2),(1,5),(2,4),(3,4),(3,5)])
S,C,f = cleave(G, cut_vertices=[1,2,3], virtual_edges=True)
```
In the case where `virtual_edges` is set to True, `f` is a path graph on `3` vertices. In the case where it is set to False, it is a graph with `3` isolated vertices. However, according to the definition of `f`, 
    `f` is the complement of the subgraph of `G` induced by the vertex cut. Hence, its vertex set is the vertex cut, and its edge set is the set of virtual edges.

Hence, when `virtual_edges` is set to False, `f` in the above example should be a graph on vertices `1,2 and 3` with one edge between `2` and `3` (which is the complement of the subgraph). I am not sure what the output should be when `virtual_edges` is set to true.

When `virtual_edges==False`, we don't add virtual edges to the sides of the cut. `f` is the graph containing only the virtual edges, so when we don't add virtual edges, `f` has no edges. When `virtual_edges==True`, then `f` is the complement of the subgraph induced by the cut. We should update the documentation accordingly.

Concerning last commit: 
The convention in Sagemath is to write `Return the connected components...` and not `Returns the connected components...`.
It has not yet been unified. We change it step by step.

We will have the same output for virtual_edge == True and False if the complement subgraph of cut vertices has no edges, which means subgraph of cut vertices is a complete graph. \\

And yes, `f` has no virtual edge when `virtual_edge == False` we can see it at virtual edges set to the false case in example.

In the example I considered, when `virtual_edges==True`, the virtual edges that are added are `(1,3)` and `(2,3)`. So when `virtual_edges==True`, `f` is the complement of the subgraph induced by the cut? Or `f` is the graph containing only the virtual edges? If it is the former, `f` would be a graph on `3` vertices with one edge between `(2,3)`. If it is the latter, `f` would be a path graph on three vertices. Currently, the output `f` is a path graph on `3` vertices. 

I know I am asking too many times, but I would like to update the documentation to make it more clear.

My mistake, I saw in `generic_graph.py` and followed the same. I will change it.
