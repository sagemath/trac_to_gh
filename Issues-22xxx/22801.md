The symbolic method used for manifolds and differentiable manifolds is "symbolic", the default in [SageMath](SageMath).
In this ticket we introduce the use of SymPy as an option when the Chart in the manifold is created.

At this point there is a dependence on Sympy ticket:
"sympy to sage conversion : Abstract function."

<a id='comment:17'></a>There are a few things that need fixing.

- Not all methods have docstrings/tests
- There are a number of tests where the line before is informational, but it needs a blankline, e.g.:
  {{{#!diff
`@``@` -1641,6 +1641,19 `@``@` class TopologicalManifold(ManifoldSubset):

+
+        Same tests with ``sympy``::
+            sage: c_xyz.set_calculus_method('sympy')
+            sage: f = U.scalar_field(sin(x)*cos(y) + z, name='F'); f
+            Scalar field F on the Open subset U of the 3-dimensional topological manifold M

}}}
- IMO, you are too liberal with your blanklines spacing things out that makes the code a little uneven to read.

I see in the difference the following one:

```
@@ -231,7 +225,7 @@ class DiffForm(TensorField):
         sage: a.display(eU)
         a = x*(y**2 + 2) dx/\dy
         sage: a.display(eV)
-        a = (-u**3/16 + u**2*v/16 + u*v**2/16 - u/2 - v**3/16 - v/2) du/\dv
+        a = (-u**3/16 + u*v**2/16 - u/2 - v**3/16 + v*(u**2 - 8)/16) du/\dv
```

I found is surprising : do you know where this difference comes from?

It is due to a different setting: in the previous version, the transition map `xy_to_uv` was redefined, thereby causing a different handling of computations between `SR` and `sympy`. Note that the two expressions of `a` are mathematically equivalent, which is satisfactory.

At a particular moment during development I introduced it but I don't remember its functionality. As it is used only internally to `ChartFunction` I will remove this argument.

Look at this example:

```
M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
X.<x,y> = M.chart()
f = X.function(x^2+3*y+1)
g = f+1/2

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: unable to find a common ring for all elements

The need for such a matrix arises from a change of basis in some tangent space to the sphere, where all tensor components are expressed in terms of SymPy floats (because of the sampling for the drawing). Probably some workaround can be found.

Besides, I am still checking a few other things...

```
nabla(nabla(psi).up(g)).trace()

When multiprocessing is turned off (nproc=1), this notebook completes without error.

Done in the above commit.

> 2) Are we letting the TODO's remain undone for this release?


IMHO yes, because they require substantial work and do not hinder the functionality implemented here.

> 3) In vectorfield_module.py, two occurrences each of "from the North pole" and "from the South pole" were changed to "from North pole" and "from South pole", respectively, resulting in non-standard English.


Corrected in the above commit; thanks.

Besides the above typos, the last commit restores the trig simplification that was commented out in `simplify_chain_generic_sympy` and `simplify_chain_real_sympy`. On general grounds, the SymPy simplification chain should be improved in another ticket.

As you pointed out in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3sN7gVTdNuY/U9v70LoDAwAJ , this bug is not related to this ticket.

> By the way, I wonder why you prefer using pexpect interface to maxima, instead of much faster maxima_calcuclus loadable library interface?


Certainly by lack of knowledge... Thanks for your feedback! Can you elaborate a little bit though? Do you mean it is bad to use `expr._maxima_()` for `expr` in `SR`?
