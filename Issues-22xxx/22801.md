The symbolic method used for manifolds and differentiable manifolds is "symbolic", the default in [SageMath](SageMath).
In this ticket we introduce the use of SymPy as an option when the Chart in the manifold is created.

At this point there is a dependence on Sympy ticket:
"sympy to sage conversion : Abstract function."

<a id='comment:17'></a>There are a few things that need fixing.

- Not all methods have docstrings/tests
- There are a number of tests where the line before is informational, but it needs a blankline, e.g.:
  {{{#!diff
`@``@` -1641,6 +1641,19 `@``@` class TopologicalManifold(ManifoldSubset):
             F: U --> R

+
+        Same tests with ``sympy``::
+            sage: c_xyz.set_calculus_method('sympy')
+            sage: f = U.scalar_field(sin(x)*cos(y) + z, name='F'); f

- IMO, you are too liberal with your blanklines spacing things out that makes the code a little uneven to read.

It is due to a different setting: in the previous version, the transition map `xy_to_uv` was redefined, thereby causing a different handling of computations between `SR` and `sympy`. Note that the two expressions of `a` are mathematically equivalent, which is satisfactory.

At a particular moment during development I introduced it but I don't remember its functionality. As it is used only internally to `ChartFunction` I will remove this argument.

Look at this example:

Done in the above commit.

> 2) Are we letting the TODO's remain undone for this release?


IMHO yes, because they require substantial work and do not hinder the functionality implemented here.

> 3) In vectorfield_module.py, two occurrences each of "from the North pole" and "from the South pole" were changed to "from North pole" and "from South pole", respectively, resulting in non-standard English.


Corrected in the above commit; thanks.

Besides the above typos, the last commit restores the trig simplification that was commented out in `simplify_chain_generic_sympy` and `simplify_chain_real_sympy`. On general grounds, the SymPy simplification chain should be improved in another ticket.

As you pointed out in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/3sN7gVTdNuY/U9v70LoDAwAJ , this bug is not related to this ticket.

> By the way, I wonder why you prefer using pexpect interface to maxima, instead of much faster maxima_calcuclus loadable library interface?


Certainly by lack of knowledge... Thanks for your feedback! Can you elaborate a little bit though? Do you mean it is bad to use `expr._maxima_()` for `expr` in `SR`?
