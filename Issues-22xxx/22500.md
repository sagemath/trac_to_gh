Two polyhedra are combinatorially isomorphic if their face lattices are isomorphic as posets.

The test for combinatorial isomorphism should test the isomorphism of the vertex-facet adjacency graph of both polyhedra.

Hi Moritz,

Here are some corrections:

- the input should be something like:

```
    INPUT:
    - ``other`` - a polyhedron object
    - ``algorithm`` (default=`bipartite_graph`) - specifies the algorithm to use. The other possible value is `face_lattice`.
```

- The paragraph starting with `Checking that a` should be unindented (and next block also)
- `intersected its...` should be `intersected with its reflection through the origin.`
- `isomorpic to ` -> `isomorphic to the`
- several other missing words.
- start with a simple example, perhaps move the less informative ones to a section TESTS::
- pep 8 conventions (spacing ` = `, etc.)
- f-vector -> `f`-vector .  (add `r` before the docstring)
- make the `AssertionError` messages consistent with the input names, to help the user.
- separated the `AssertionError` about the compactness of `self` and `other``
- Add a comment about the prior check on the number of vertices and facets (did you make some tests to see whether this improves the speed on some examples?) It would be nice to have it here.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

Two explanations for speed:

To see, that the check before building the bipartite graph is necessary, we do some timing.
When we don't check the number of vertices facets, we get:

```
sage: C=polytopes.hypercube(14)
sage: D = polytopes.hypercube(15)
sage: time C.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(D)
CPU times: user 5.4 s, sys: 80 ms, total: 5.48 s
Wall time: 5.43 s
False
```

otherwise:

```
sage: C=polytopes.hypercube(14)
Dsage: D=polytopes.hypercube(15)
sage: time C.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(D)
CPU times: user 20 ms, sys: 32 ms, total: 52 ms
Wall time: 38.6 ms
False
```

The following tests shows, that the  `bipartite_graph` is much faster then `face_lattice` algorithm. For the 7-cube it is more than 1000 times faster on my machine

```
sage: time C.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(C, algo='face_lattice')
CPU times: user 28.5 s, sys: 64 ms, total: 28.6 s
Wall time: 28.6 s
True
sage: time C.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(C, algo='bipartite_graph')
CPU times: user 24 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 24 ms
Wall time: 23.6 ms
True
```
}}}

<div id="comment:13" align="right">comment:13</div>

There are still some things to correct:

- `algo` to `algorithm`: it is better to have a complete keyword.
- sixgon -> hexagon
- `intersected its...` should be `intersected with its reflection through the origin.`
- `isomorpic to ` -> `isomorphic to the`
- but different combinatorial type**s**

The reference did not seem to work, but maybe that may be because my doc is broken. The rest of the doc seems to be okay.
