GAP 4.10 comes with a completely rewritten build system that will simplify
our packaging. In particular, libGAP no longer needs to be a separate package.

What the branch does:

- Remove the libgap spkg

- Update the gap spkg to the new build system and build and install libgap

- Replace `gap.shi.patch` by a plain gap startup script for Sage

  Rationale: GAP used to provide a startup shell script. The GAP devs
  are in the process of getting rid of it and provide a very minimal
  one. They recommend to just write our own rather than patching it.

- Update a few doctests w.r.t. changes of output of some GAP functions

- Reworks how gap is installed in `$SAGE_LOCAL`: Rather than installing the entire source tree we just install the `gap` and `libgap` binaries to standard locations, and add a `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap` containing the `GAP_ROOT_DIR` which is stripped down to the minimum needed for GAP to work (standard libs and packages, docs, as well as the source code for introspection of kernel functions, but all build artifacts are carefully omitted).

  - Some of how this is done is still broken w.r.t. building compiled packages; need to work on it a bit more.

- - **Possibly controversial:** The new libgap currently 'does not come' with symbol rewriting (`foobar` -> `libGAP_foobar`). This avoids messing around with GAP's sources; in particular opening the door for using a stock GAP from the OS distribution. However there always is a risk of name conflicts. And indeed, GAP's enums `T_INT`, `T_FLOAT`, ... conflict with Python's constants defined in `structmember.h`. This is hopefully not actually a problem in practice due to the way how Cython orders includes.

  Something similar was started by Volker at #19915.

- Removes configure.patch: it was patching configure for better GMP
  detection under Cygwin (#13954). This should not be needed anymore
  with the new build system and use of --with-gmp. If it is, upstream
  asked for it to be reported and they will fix it.

- Removes additional patches for now--we would like to focus on being
  able to work with a system GAP as much as possible.

- Revert #19726 (not needed anymore)

### Status
Currently broken - crashes deep inside GAP error handling system after few simple commands. 

Basic tests on libgap:

```
sage: libgap.eval("GAPInfo.Version")
sage: libgap.DihedralGroup(10).CharacterTable()
CharacterTable( <pc group of size 10 with 2 generators> )
sage: libgap.Group(libgap.eval("[(1,2,3),(1,2)]")).Size()
6
```

Running most relevant tests:

```
sage -tp 8 sage/groups sage/libs/gap
```
Current status: lots of errors

- Still have some miscellaneous segfaults and other weird crashes

- Still have work to do on improving error handling; replacing the built-in `ErrorInner` function might help here.

- SIGINT handling by Python is broken by `GAP_Intialize`; need to work around this.

Testing packages with dynamic loading (e.g. IO):

Install IO:

```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap/pkg
wget https://www.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4/tar.gz/packages/io-4.5.4.tar.gz
tar xvf io-4.5.4.tar.gz
cd io-4.5.4
./configure --with-gaproot=../..
make
```

Test it locally:

```
cd $SAGE_ROOT
gap
gap> LoadPackage("IO");
true
```

This does not yet work:

```
#W dlopen() error: /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/share/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64/io.so: undefine\
d symbol: ChangedBags
Error, module '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/share/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64/io.so' not found
Error, was not in any namespace
Syntax warning: Unbound global variable in /home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/share/gap/lib/init.g:803
    ColorPrompt( UserPreference( "UseColorPrompt" ) );
               ^
Error, SetGasmanMessageStatus: function is not yet defined
true
```
This should be fixed once GAP's gap binary is built on top of libgap.
See: https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 I believe this is fixed, but there are still some problems with the way this ticket is "installing" GAP for `$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Note:

- Max Horn reviewed the list of GAP symbols we use in Sage; some have already changed in 4.9. See this [pad](https://hackmd.io/emNi76svSWCh1fBeLKqPdA?edit#) for notes.

Exactly.

> Do we have an idea on when we'll have just have gap linking on libgap which would also solve this particular problem?


The GAP developers are well aware of that and planning to implement it. They have not yet done yet just to be more incremental; their new build system is a big PR already :-) I would assume that this will be done before GAP 4.9 which they are planning for a couple months from now.

See: https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/2

Btw: feel free to comment / expand on the list there. I'll advertise this issue for additional feedback on the sage-packaging mailing list.

Two completely separate packages would also mean that `gap_packages` should come in two different flavours, etc. I'd rather keep it simple and do not multiply these instances (but rather hope that `libGAP` will support all of GAP packages soon).

I wanted to experiment with how far we were from having a proper
single package, so as to give early feedback to the gap developers on
any sticking points. And indeed, linking gap to libgap is basically
the only sticking point. Since this point will be most likely resolved
by the time this ticket gets merged in, we might as well shoot
directly for the "right thing".

YES. In fact that is my main motivation to work on the libgap
integration: I badly want to use Semigroups that requires IO! We went
through the details with Markus and Max, and the shared aim is indeed
to have this resolved with the upgrade to 4.9.

In principle yes: the branch I posted here last April was using their stock alpha version. Now the next step is to revive the branch and adapt it if needed.

I can work on this, but probably not at once. Any volunteer to take over welcome.

With the past and future modifications to the Sage build system in mind, I now object more strongly than before to treating two separate packages (GAP + libGAP) as one package.

The reason is that we now try to separate the build and install stages of packages. But that is incompatible with the recipe here of first "build and install GAP" and then "build and install libGAP".

For an example of two Sage packages with the same sources, see `gcc` and `gfortran`. IMHO, you should do the same for GAP and libGAP (unless they are merged upstream but my impression is that this has not happened yet).

Hopefully we will be getting something more serious at final release time, like with pari where you build libpari and then the gp executable. That would be the ideal scenario where it is really one package. Have to see how far they have gone with 4.9.

I am not sure I understand. Currently in Cython on can do something like

```
    from sage.libs.gap.libgap import libgap
    g=libgap.ProjectiveGeneralLinearGroup(3,3)
```
How will this change under what you propose?

I think GAP 4.9.0 is considered a public beta for GAP 4.9.

The list of releases at

* https://www.gap-system.org/Releases/

still displays GAP 4.8.10 as the latest release.

In the list of past releases there, the GAP 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 series
start at GAP 4.8.2, 4.7.2, 4.6.2, 4.5.4, so probably GAP 4.x.y with
those x and lower y were considered beta.

Still, seeing how 4.9.0 works with Sage would be nice.

It seems that this branch which "will be merged soon" is still not merged. It would be good to have an idea of whether or not that will happen.

According to https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/1205#issuecomment-385670578,
Markus's libgap branch won't be merged in GAP 4.9: it's not yet ready enough. Bummer.

We are discussing with Sebastian and Thomas what we can do to move forward here. They
are very interested as well by libgap for the integration between GAP and Julia.

Tentative steps:
- As a warm up, upgrade our current gap and libgap spkg to 4.8.10
- Upgrade our current gap and libgap spkg to 4.9; with the many changes to
  the build system, this may get more tricky
- To make the switch to GAP's libgap less urgent, investigate whether we could change
  our current libgap spkg to not prefix GAP symbols, in order to be able to 
  use GAP's dynamic packages; see #25273
- On the GAP side: move toward more incremental changes. In particular,
  extract the changesets from Markus branch that are non
  controversial and ready, and get them merged in GAP (4.9? 4.10?)

Has anybody asked GAP developers for a policy on the prefixing?

In Cernay, I proposed that GAP should prefix some/all of their names like `T_INT` -> `GAP_T_INT`. For compiling GAP (+ GAP packages) itself, we can use a file with defines like

```
#define  T_INT  GAP_T_INT
```
to ensure backwards compatibility. This way, in GAP itself, one could use either `T_INT` or `GAP_T_INT`. Outside of GAP, only `GAP_T_INT` would work.

I think this is relatively easy to implement (I'm willing to do it) but I don't know what upstream GAP thinks of it.

Hi,

For the record: I experimented a bit a month ago and a bit more
this morning with Dima with the latest gap master that
has `make libgap` and `make install-libgap` rules.
See the following branch, which builds libgap from GAP's pristine
sources:

https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/log/?h=u/nthiery/gap-libgap

Note that, at this stage, Sage won't start with it; maybe even not compile.

That's the idea indeed. Eventually they will provide a standalone header file that will
define the official GAP API, and where all symbols will be prefixed. To bootstrap the
process, we (well mostly Max!) reviewed and annotated the symbols that are used in Sage:

This is WIP - builds, but libgap.pyx interaction loop has to be rewritten using new API.

Also, `sage --gap` is broken

In the current branch I am able to run

```
sage: g=libgap.SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: print(g.Order())
24
sage: i=g.Order().sage()
sage: i
24
```
So it's outputting GAP object that is broken ATM.

I'll try fixing the "old" GAP interface, perhaps it will help.

see[comment:86](#comment%3A86) - displaying (lib)GAP objects is broken.
Also, 

```
sage: gap(1)
** Gap crashed or quit executing 'SetUserPreference("HistoryMaxLines", 30);' **
Restarting Gap and trying again
** Gap crashed or quit executing '\$sage1:=1;;' **
...
```
the latter is probably due to some scripts gotten messed up by the upgrade.

And error handling in libgap interface needs work, too.

in GAP 4.8.6 this works:

I've asked [here](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/2875), as this is due to format change of internal GAP data...

Please see
https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/2874 for the current sticking point, which is error handling and processing of error messages.
Basically, the question is whether it's possible to retain the behaviour of libGAP without patches to the GAP's kernel.

I'd like someone who knows more about libGAP error handling to have a look at badly butchered by me parts in the branch dealing with it, and suggest what should be done.

Another (easier) thing to fix is GAP and libgap documentation display.

On the present branch, I get

```
sage: a=libgap(1)
sage: a
*** trouble in PRINT_OR_APPEND_TO_STREAM***
...
*** trouble in PRINT_OR_APPEND_TO_STREAM***
1
```
after this GAP is pretty much nuked. This happens during ipython's attempts to pretty-print `a`, so that it tries to find `_rich_repr_` etc. Specifically, at least on the system I am running this, the trouble starts not immediately, but where `_rich_png_` (or the previous thing in the loop) is checked for by `get_real_method` in `IPython/utils/dir2.py`.

If I run the same from `./sage --python` (after loading Sage there as usual) at least this much (and more) works.

I don't have a good idea how to debug this, so I'd like to pass the token now.

Great! From what I saw yesterday it seemed like there were some doubts about how soon 4.10 would be released. But this being the case I rescind my previous comment.

I should clarify: GAP itself compiles just fine.  But "installation", such that there is any, is still a partially-broken headache, and I'm experimenting how best to incorporate a GAP installation into Sage.

For now I'll probably keep with something similar to what we have currently, of having a GAP_DIR under `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap`.  But I'm trying to decide, in that case, what the best thing to do with libgap might be.

Though I'm also trying to see if we can do something entirely different with the installation.  There's something close to a standard "make install" but it isn't quite right, and I don't know how it works with GAP packages.

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:2'></a>\nIt seems that currently `make install` actually just installs the libtool wrapper script for `gap`, and not the plain `gap` executable.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not--normally this would not make a whole lot of sense I think.  Though one advantage to it is that the libtool wrapper script adds the \"GAP_ROOT\" that it was built in to `PATH`, and thus it seems capable of finding its way to the original GAP_ROOT it was installed from.  This doesn't really work though, from the perspective of system packaging.  The paths hard-coded in the libtool wrapper script are to the build directory itself, so when we move all the GAP_ROOT files to a new location such as `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/gap-4.10` it doesn't work properly with that GAP_ROOT.\n\nBetter to do what we did traditionally of having `bin/gap` as a shell script that wraps the real `gap` executable and passes an appropriate `-l` flag.  Dima's branch already has something to that effect, though rather than patching `bin/gap.sh` I think we should just install our own custom `gap` script, such as the one that's currently in this branch but unused.  \n\nI'm also experimenting with adding the actual executable under something like `bin/gap-bin`.  I don't think we need all the files from the GAP source tree, much less build artifacts.  I think we can have a minimal GAP_ROOT of sorts (e.g. under `share/gap`) that includes `grp/`, `lib/`, `pkg/` at a minimum...  Maybe `doc/`?  And possibly also `src/` (so that `PageSource` can work for kernel functions) but I'm not sure if that's needed or not...",

It seems that currently `make install` actually just installs the libtool wrapper script for `gap`, and not the plain `gap` executable.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not--normally this would not make a whole lot of sense I think.  Though one advantage to it is that the libtool wrapper script adds the "GAP_ROOT" that it was built in to `PATH`, and thus it seems capable of finding its way to the original GAP_ROOT it was installed from.  This doesn't really work though, from the perspective of system packaging.  The paths hard-coded in the libtool wrapper script are to the build directory itself, so when we move all the GAP_ROOT files to a new location such as `$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/gap-4.10` it doesn't work properly with that GAP_ROOT.

Better to do what we did traditionally of having `bin/gap` as a shell script that wraps the real `gap` executable and passes an appropriate `-l` flag.  Dima's branch already has something to that effect, though rather than patching `bin/gap.sh` I think we should just install our own custom `gap` script, such as the one that's currently in this branch but unused.  

I'm also experimenting with adding the actual executable under something like `bin/gap-bin`.  I don't think we need all the files from the GAP source tree, much less build artifacts.  I think we can have a minimal GAP_ROOT of sorts (e.g. under `share/gap`) that includes `grp/`, `lib/`, `pkg/` at a minimum...  Maybe `doc/`?  And possibly also `src/` (so that `PageSource` can work for kernel functions) but I'm not sure if that's needed or not...

Breaking libGAP should be easy, but GAP itself should be OK, I think.

Depends. If it's an improvement over Dima's branch...

The question is basically: if I want to work on the libGAP interface, on which branch should I work?

(after not forgetting to remove the stale (lib)GAP workspaces - all bets are off if they are present, e.g. it might be why Erik's job hang, probably something to rectify in the installation prcedure) I can do

```

This is the sort of crashes I traced to ipython trying to do a rich display of `a`, basically, making GAP repeatedly report errors.

It seems that now I can reproduce this hanging, it seems that libgap workspace does not load correctly, so to start Sage and libgap I have to manually remove it in `~/.sage/gap/`.

Dima, from where did you download the 4.10.0 tarball?  The one I got from gap-system.org was a tar.gz as in my branch.

I can't tell exactly what file you're looking at, but if the `bin/` directory you reference above is the one that gets created in the gap source three, that's the normal executable.  I'm taking about the `gap` that gets installed to `$PREFIX` when you run `make install`.

Basically.  I replaced `-T` with `-E`, since `-T` is *implied* by `--no-interact` (which should probably also imply `-E`, but it doesn't).

However, as you pointed out, there's an off-by-one and now I'm not so sure if `--no-interact` was being processed at all.

There's what I would consider a bug in GAP, where the function `PRINT_OR_APPEND_TO_STREAM` goes:

```
    /* try to open the file for output                                     */
    i = OpenOutputStream(stream);
    if ( ! i ) {
        ErrorQuit( "%s: cannot open stream for output", (Int)funcname, 0L );
        return 0;
    }
```

but if this is called to print to the `ERROR_OUTPUT` stream *during* `ErrorQuit` then we get an infinite recursion.  This is the root cause of the segfault's we're seeing.  What I'm not sure about is why `OpenOutputStream` would fail, since we close `ERROR_OUTPUT` after each error, and then re-open it as a new stream.  That part bothers me.

No, I don't have an updated branch.  I'm not seeing that problem before.

So we're leaving things in a slightly fragile state; and more importantly we're not cleaning up after ourselves.  I believe that's the case here.

Now printing GAP elements works, and it also fixes tab-completion.  So a lot of basic stuff works with this.  I make no guarantees about memory leaks, reference counting, etc.

I don't know what you mean that it would "break interrupts".  Either way handling an interrupt with cysignals and not returning to GAP is going to break things.

There's definitely still a problem somewhere:

```
sage: b = libgap.eval('Sleep(5);')
Caught error at top-most level, probably quit from library loading
```

It sleeps, then displays that message immediately and quits the process.  Strangely, the only source I can find for that message is at the end of `InitializeGap` which should have already exited.  I think there is still some strange things going on in GAP's error handling...

On the other hand if I do:

```
sage: f = libgap.eval('Sleep;')
sage: f
<Gap function "Sleep">
sage: f(5)
```

it works.  But when I hit Ctrl-C:

```
sage: f(10)
^CCaught error at top-most level, probably quit from library loading
```

and the process quits again.

(A) If the keep the `sig_on()` statements, then CTRL-C would break GAP in the same way as `sig_error()` breaks GAP.

(B) If you remove the `sig_on()` statements, then GAP can no longer be interrupted with CTRL-C.

I consider both alternatives not acceptable.

This will need new hooks in cysignals though. Also, all `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` statements should be removed from the GAP interface.

Given that this is not the first priority, I'll let you guys work further. We can deal with interrupts once we have a mostly-finished GAP interface.

I was wondering about that.  I'm not sure cysignals is needed at all really, though if it can provide a wrapper interface to make things easier that might be nice.  I think it would be sufficient, when entering and leaving `GAP_EvalString`, to just register/unregister a custom signal handler, for SIGINT at the very least.

We also need to be careful around `GAP_Initialize` to restore any existing SIGINT handler that gets clobbered by GAP's initialization...

Strangely, the only source I can find for that message is at the end of `InitializeGap` which should have already exited.  I think there is still some strange things going on in GAP's error handling...\n\n\nThe reason for this appears to be a bug in how we're processing the result list from `GAP_EvalString`--in particular it is the equivalent of a Python `IndexError` on the list.  GAP is treating this as a sort of internal error, meaning it jumps to the last invocation of its `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR/CATCH_ERROR` macros.  But since in our code we're not in a `TRY/CATCH`, perversely the last `TRY` is back in `InitializeGap`, so it invokes a longjmp back there.\n\nIt seems we can work around that by using the `ELM_PLIST` function directly rather than the higher-level generic `ELM_LIST`.  The lower-level function does not invoke GAP error handling.  I've added another comment about this here: https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/2988/files#r233021437",

The reason for this appears to be a bug in how we're processing the result list from `GAP_EvalString`--in particular it is the equivalent of a Python `IndexError` on the list.  GAP is treating this as a sort of internal error, meaning it jumps to the last invocation of its `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR/CATCH_ERROR` macros.  But since in our code we're not in a `TRY/CATCH`, perversely the last `TRY` is back in `InitializeGap`, so it invokes a longjmp back there.

It seems we can work around that by using the `ELM_PLIST` function directly rather than the higher-level generic `ELM_LIST`.  The lower-level function does not invoke GAP error handling.  I've added another comment about this here: https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/2988/files#r233021437

Should I just go ahead and attach my branch to this ticket?

It's up to date with my current work, which mostly works pretty well except for three major issues that I'm aware of:

1) The weirdness with hanging during GAP initialization if there is an existing workspace.  This might have something to do with the issue Markus has mentioned w.r.t. spawning a shell (??) for some reason.  I'm going to look into that next since I consider it the most severe issue for getting something usable.  I'm sure I can figure it out quickly; I just haven't investigated it at all yet.

2) General issues regarding signal handling.  The situation there mostly isn't great--I found some cases where even GAP's eval loop can't be interrupted.  I agree with Jeroen that ideally that's "not acceptable", but I believe we may need to compromise in the near term (and the situation isn't all that better in current Sage either).

3) The `Panic` issue.  I've confirmed that affects current Sage as well.  I believe Markus has made some comment to suggest he's thinking about that (among other related issues) so we may have a solution at some point (I think the obvious one, at least broadly speaking, is just having a hook for what `Panic` actually *does*).  But I'm not going to worry about that for the purposes of GAP 4.10 integration since it's at least not a regression.

I don't think so, because I fixed that in my branch and it still happens.

Yes, but I don't know that that's necessarily the right thing to do in the case of GAP.  Much of GAP's error handling code is actually written in the GAP language (in the error.g library), where as Panic() seems primarily reserved for cases where the GAP kernel cannot be guaranteed to work anymore, much handle errors correctly.

A similar, but more subtle approach, would be to bypass most of the normal higher-level error-handling functionality, but still use `JUMP_TO_CATCH` to allow the error to be handled.  If the GAP interpreter process wants to just exit upon such errors it can do that in the appropriate `CATCH` handler.

That's probably still naïve but I would bet it's closer to what they might have in mind to do.  Of course, we can always ask...

I was slightly barking up the wrong tree with the `PostRestoreFuncs`.  Turns out it's hanging right after that in the function called `SESSION`.  That's where it invokes that problematic `SHELL()` call:

```
 36 BIND_GLOBAL("SESSION",
 37     function()
 38     local   prompt;
 39
 40     if GAPInfo.CommandLineOptions.q then
 41         prompt := "";
 42     else
 43         prompt := "gap> ";
 44     fi;
 45
 46     SHELL( GetBottomLVars(), # in global context
 47         false, # no return
 48         false, # no return  obj
 49         3,     # set last, last2 and last3 each command
 50         true,  # set time after each command
 51         prompt,
 52         function()
 53             if IsBound(OnGAPPromptHook) and IsFunction(OnGAPPromptHook) then
 54                 OnGAPPromptHook();
 55             else
 56                 return;
 57             fi;
 58         end,
 59         "*stdin*",
 60         "*stdout*",
 61         true);
 62
 63     BreakOnError := false;
 64 end);
```

I'm still no exactly sure what this is for or why it causes libgap to hang in Sage.  But it seems we can avoid it by using the `--norepl` option.  What's strange is that `--nointeract` should imply `--norepl` but that doesn't appear to be working.  That *would* have been the case with the off-by-one error in `argc` that Dima pointed out.  But I fixed that and it didn't seem to help :/

Perhaps this is simple...

Ok.  Putting the following `gaprc` in GAP_ROOT works around it:

```
if GAPInfo.CommandLineOptions.norepl then
    # GAP 4.10.0 has a bug that an interactive session will be started
    # even if --norepl was set; see https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/2840
    # To work around this we redefine the SESSION function to a no-op
    MAKE_READ_WRITE_GLOBAL("SESSION");
    UNBIND_GLOBAL("SESSION");
    BIND_GLOBAL("SESSION", function() end);
fi;
```

my one concern is that if there is a gaprc in the `UserGapRoot` this will be ignored.  I'm not 100% sure if that's the way it works or not.  Need to double-check.

I see now that the pexpect interface does something similar with `sage.g`.  It just lives in `SAGE_EXTCODE` rather than being installed in the package itself (I obviously prefer the latter).  For libgap we probably shouldn't need most of the stuff in `sage.g` but I'm not sure.

It appears to get lost in `gap_reset_workspace` while loading the packages 'sonata' and 'guava'.  It doesn't run into problems with other packages.  So there are two problems:

1) The fact that something is broken when loading those packages

2) The fact that Sage's pexpect parser for GAP seems to go into an infinite loop upon those error conditions (it even prints "Warning: this should never happen"--so whatever "this" is apparently *can* happen, and the parser does not behave well when it does.

Looking at this ticket. Of course it became very long and I can't get an overview of all thread, but some comments while scrolling through it:

1) There is a smaller archive https://www.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4core/gap-4.10.0-core.zip of the core GAP system and four _required_ packages, if it helps to reduce the bandwidth. You can then get matching package archive from https://www.gap-system.org/pub/gap/gap4pkgs/ (ask me which). Also, may be helpful to reduce interaction with packages

2) From doc/dev - `PostRestoreFunctions` are called after a workspace has been loaded to finish linking up the kernel and workspace. Some of those from `GAPInfo.PostRestoreFunctions` may be added by packages (GAPDoc, GRAPE).

3) Did you get it to work without the workspace already?

4) "A lot of the test suites under tst/ seem to work, or mostly work" - the word "mostly" sounds alarming. see e.g. https://travis-ci.org/gap-system/gap-docker-stable-4.10-testsuite - everything should work there.

5) `doc` directory of GAP - of course, please include it. Allow the user to use it from GAP command line via `?<search_term>` mechanism. 

All from me for now!

It works normally, but when I run gap with the `-p` flag ("enable/disable package output mode") it hangs like:

I don't fully understand what `-p` means or what all the output above is, though I know that Sage's pexect interface to GAP uses this debug output extensively to understand what's going on.  

Same if I do `LoadPackage("sonata", false)`, so at least it has nothing to do with the banner??

If I press enter a few times while it's hanging (or really any other input) it eventually outputs

FWIW we (Arch) faced a similar issue some time ago:

My "fix" was to patch out loading xgap from sonata/PackageInfo.g

I've noticed that after installing this branch I still have `gap` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` pointing at the wrong location of GAP executable.

In fact, I also get `gap-bin` in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin`, and by right, `gap` should be a link
to the latter. 

Correction - one should change the script to point to the right GAP_DIR too, it seems...

```
#!/bin/sh
GAP_DIR=$SAGE_LOCAL/gap/latest
GAP_EXE=$GAP_DIR
exec "$GAP_EXE/gap" -l "$GAP_DIR" "$@"
```

It seems that spkg-install should remove the whole `SAGE_LOCAL/gap/` to make sure to stale copies of GAP are used after the update.

My solution is to add the following to `sage.g`:

```

This might be slightly fragile, as I don't think `GAPInfo.ExcludeFromAutoload` is meant to be manipulated directly (normally it should be set via `SetUserPreference`, but it's too late to do that in `sage.g`).  Seems to work though.

The patch Dima mentioned isn't relevant here because none of those default packages use xgap.  I don't think we should rely on that being patched out anyways.

We have some other serious problems with error handling, in particular in the areas where we go outside of what is currently possible with the libgap API--particularly when we do things like call functions directly with `CALL_<N>ARGS`.  Unfortunately I don't see a great way around that right now.  The current, very limited API provided to us has a way to get a pointer to a global variable (e.g. with `GAP_ValueGlobalVariable`) but then no way to really do anything with it--in particular no way to pass it as an argument to a function--without going outside the API.

That means that before errors occur somewhere down in the GAP kernel resulting in a longjump to `STATE(ReadJmpError)`, we need to always ensure that it has somewhere to jump *to* that makes sense.

Currently when we wrap those calls in `sig_on()` and `sig_off()` we at least get a segfault handled by cysignals, but we can lose any useful error reporting from GAP if an error occurs somewhere that doesn't go through our error handling.  Further confusing matters, there's an internal function `ReadEvalError()` that's kind of like a `raise` which just jump to the last `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR`.

LEN_LIST should be fine, use ELM0_LIST if you want to get the 0 for unbound elements of the list.

`xgap` is a 20+ years old [X11 code](https://gap-packages.github.io/xgap/htm/chapters.htm). It's not working on many X11 setups (won't build, or builds, but the resulting package does not work), is tricky get working on OSX or Windows, and there is a Jupyter-based replacement being worked on.
I don't think Sage can realistically support it.

No, you get the same with the Sage's current GAP 4.8.6.

> `SymmetricGroup` should only start on the relevant line...

Sure.

I don't have an answer to this immediately - this particular change was a result of testing on a custom tarball I built from source; perhaps the upstream tarball packages docs in a bit different way. Let's postpone this until other things are done here.

P.S. rereading some earlier posts, it seems that you need `-p` for Sage's pexpect interface. Fine then. I suggest only that instead of tweaking `GAPInfo.ExcludeFromAutoload` in `gap/sage.g` you use another user preference:

```
##  These packages are not regarded as available. This doesn't work for
##  packages which are needed by the GAP library, or which are already

# SetUserPreference( "PackagesToIgnore", [ ] );
```
This way, you ignore this package if GAP is loaded for [SageMath](SageMath), but if it is compiled properly, it still can be used if one works with GAP directly.

Point being, I want to do away with the notion of a "GAP in Sage" being necessary as opposed to an existing GAP installation.  Sage should work and integrate with an existing GAP and not provide its own GAP as its own remote universe separate from the GAP installation that a user might already be using.

We can iron out the kinks in e.g. `sage.libs.gap.all_documented_functions` and in GAP workspaces handling later.\n\n\nI agree, you're right. And there's more work to be done on that.  I have something that mostly works, but I want to think a little more systematically about it and come up with something a bit cleaner.\n\nRelated to that, I think, alas, there is still a need for some kind of `libgap_enter/exit` functions like from Volker's libgap.  Obviously the idea of the official \"libgap API\" would be such that nothing like this is needed.  But right now there are still many areas where we are (more or less unavoidably) bypassing that and calling GAP kernel functions directly.\n\nGASMAN needs to know where the bottom of the execution stack is (at least as far as GAP objects are present) in order to properly mark bags that are initialized in global variables, and I believe we may have some cases like that. I think this might explain some weird segfaults and other errors. I'm getting from time to time.  The problem is that GAP assumes that everything stems from an initial `InitializeGap` call that's at the bottom of the stack.  But when using GAP as a library that is clearly not true.  \n\nI'm not sure what the GAP developers intend us to do in this case, as this is clearly a problem for anyone using GAP as a library.  Do we have to manage references ourselves even for local variables?  That would seem fragile, whereas the old `libgap_enter()` very clearly marks the \"bottom\" of the stack so far as GASMAN needs to be concerned.  I will ask.",

I agree, you're right. And there's more work to be done on that.  I have something that mostly works, but I want to think a little more systematically about it and come up with something a bit cleaner.

Related to that, I think, alas, there is still a need for some kind of `libgap_enter/exit` functions like from Volker's libgap.  Obviously the idea of the official "libgap API" would be such that nothing like this is needed.  But right now there are still many areas where we are (more or less unavoidably) bypassing that and calling GAP kernel functions directly.

GASMAN needs to know where the bottom of the execution stack is (at least as far as GAP objects are present) in order to properly mark bags that are initialized in global variables, and I believe we may have some cases like that. I think this might explain some weird segfaults and other errors. I'm getting from time to time.  The problem is that GAP assumes that everything stems from an initial `InitializeGap` call that's at the bottom of the stack.  But when using GAP as a library that is clearly not true.  

I'm not sure what the GAP developers intend us to do in this case, as this is clearly a problem for anyone using GAP as a library.  Do we have to manage references ourselves even for local variables?  That would seem fragile, whereas the old `libgap_enter()` very clearly marks the "bottom" of the stack so far as GASMAN needs to be concerned.  I will ask.

I'm not sure that's true.  I may be wrong, but the global variable `StackBottomBags` (which in official GAP, as opposed to the old libgap, is declared static so we can't easily do anything with it) is set once, when the `InitBags` function is called from `InitializeGap`. 

Garbage collections then either search up from this location if `StackBottomBags` is below the top of the stack.  Or if, for some reason, `StackBottomBags` is above, it will search down from there.  But not both. ISTM that this implementation detail is just meant to account for both architectures were the stack grows up or down, but it still bakes in an apparent assumption that `StackBottomBags` is initialized from some stack frame outside any where GAP objects are initialized.

Since `InitializeGap` is called in some arbitrary stack frame that may be either above or below future stack frames that call GAP functions, this does not seem safe unless we ensure that all future calls to GAP functions happen to occur in a deeper stack frame than when `InitializeGap` is called, which means it needs to be called early in the Python interpreter startup, just for example.

Again, I'm probably missing something but I have my doubts about this...

Garbage collection issue aside, I also believe some kind of `libgap_enter()` is necessary for error handling to work correctly, or else you can wind up in situations where if an error occurs you can wind up longjmp-ing to some weird place, like back into the `InitializeGap` call, for example.  The only other way around is to do as you originally did, and have our `error_handler` longjmp completely out of GAP to a location of our choosing, but that can cause GAP not to perform necessary error cleanup of its own (such as closing streams).

Some general comments from a gap developer.

We know the libgap is far from complete -- we will accept PRs to add functionality and (if it doesn't require Ganges to other code) are happy to add new functions in minor 4.10 releases. 

For GASMAN, yes it does support stacks going up and down -- GASMAN over the years has run on all kinds of systems, including Amigas and Ataris. For Sage's purpose, the best option would be to the stack base at he base of the stack -- is it possible to get that in Python? If not, a function which sets the pointer to some value above any stack values is sufficient.

Could Sage try to run GAP in multiple threads? In that case we would have to track all the stacks. That is also possible, but would require a GAP core change.

We have had trouble in the past with error entering an infinite loop, and are happy to accept PRs to fix it. Any changes must not change functionality for existing GAP users, and break any packages (I realise that is a high bar). It is already possible (with care) to replace the break loop, and that replacement could store the error generated.

Changes to ViewObj should be done with discussion. We are generally awarez and not entirely happy, with some printing functionality, but it's so fundamental it's very hard to change anything without breaking dozens of packages.

What do you mean by "a function which sets the pointer to some value above any stack values"?  Right now nothing like that exists officially, although I could probably do it in some gnarly hack.  Otherwise we would need a patch to GAP.

In theory sure--anything could try to run GAP code multi-threaded.  But that's never been safe AFAIK so I'm not worried about that here.  In Python multi-threading is not very common anyways since limitations in the Python interpreter make it less useful for performance purposes, so multi-process parallelism is more common.

I was thinking about something like that, but in the end it still wouldn't help, at least not with `GAP_Initialize()` as it's currently defined:

```c
void GAP_Initialize(int              argc,
                    char **          argv,
                    char **          env,
                    GAP_CallbackFunc markBagsCallback,
                    GAP_CallbackFunc errorCallback)
{
    InitializeGap(&argc, argv, env);
    SetExtraMarkFuncBags(markBagsCallback);
    STATE(JumpToCatchCallback) = errorCallback;

    GAP_True = True;
    GAP_False = False;
    GAP_Fail = Fail;
}
```

Here it passes `&argc` to `IntializeGap`, where the compiler effectively makes `argc` a stack local variable and thus `&argc` is a pointer to the `GAP_Initialize` stack frame.

I could, as you say, create (or abuse) some area earlier on the stack, and temporarily shove the value for `argc` in there.  Then I would have manually re-implement `GAP_Initialize` so that I can pass that pointer to `InitializeGap`.

Point being, of course, none of this should be necessary, and there ought to be a way to set the stack bottom for GASMAN any time to wherever is appropriate (this is what `libgap_enter` did, primarily).

I know (now) that it's incomplete.  My fear is that it won't be \"ready\" enough to fully replace Sage's use of its custom GAP fork in time for the next release, and in particular in time for the upcoming Debian freeze.

But there are some problems with that:\n\n* It places the burden on libgap users to have to worry about issues like stack frames, and ensuring that this is set up early in their application and in such a way that all future function calls are children to some call in which this is set up, which may be not always be obvious or trivial, especially (for example) if trying to implement a generic pyGAP library or the like.  It could be done, but would require hacks.\n\n* It involves a kind of \"non-local\" behavior that is hard to debug.  Actual calls to GAP functionality may not occur in an application until far from where this \"stack bottom pointer\" is initialized.  It's also inefficient.

Replying to [gh-ChrisJefferson](#comment%3A260):
> There are two seperate issues here:
> 
> 1) We need a way to set the stack bottom in GASMAN. Indeed there is no such function. As has been said multiple times, the libgap api was only introduced a short while ago as a well-defined place to put functionality needed by code outside GAP, and we can easily add a function to it to allow passing in a stack base.


That's fine. I know (now) that it's incomplete.  My fear is that it won't be "ready" enough to fully replace Sage's use of its custom GAP fork in time for the next release, and in particular in time for the upcoming Debian freeze.  Regardless, now we must work together to discover these kinds of issues and resolve them.

> 2) Do we need something more like the existing libgap_enter/leave, which kept updating this pointer all the time, and had to be called in pairs. I don't think we do, as long as we can get some pointer into the stack quite high up.


Yes, that is possible.  But there are some problems with that:

* It places the burden on libgap users to have to worry about issues like stack frames, and ensuring that this is set up early in their application and in such a way that all future function calls are children to some call in which this is set up, which may be not always be obvious or trivial, especially (for example) if trying to implement a generic pyGAP library or the like.  It could be done, but would require hacks.

* It involves a kind of "non-local" behavior that is hard to debug.  Actual calls to GAP functionality may not occur in an application until far from where this "stack bottom pointer" is initialized.  It's also inefficient.  I could grab and abuse a pointer to a local variable in `Py_Main` for example, but from there a typical code eval may be 30-40 stack frames deep, if not much more, none of which have anything to do with GAP.  I haven't evaluated exactly how much that affects the efficiency of GAP's garbage collection, but it's certainly adding needless overhead.

* Instead, having explicit `libgap_enter/exit` functions clearly demarcates where GAP-related code is expected to run.  It is both clearer to the developer (they don't even have to understand what it's for or why--just document "all code that uses libgap must be demarcated with these functions/macros)"; it's clearer for the reader of existing code ("this is where the GAP stuff starts/ends"); and it's more efficient for the garbage collector ("this marks the end of stack frames I'm responsible for").

An alternative might be to design an extensive libgap API such that this kind of memory management responsibility is completely taken away from the user, by never allowing them to allocate new Bags in their own local variables, but instead ensures that *all* GAP objects returned by the API are allocated from some pool that is entirely managed by GAP.  Then all GAP API calls could begin with the effective equivalent of "libgap_enter" while taking that responsibility entirely away from the user.  I would definitely prefer only using functions from GAP that are designated as part of some public API.  I know the API has already expanded *significantly* since the 4.10.0 release, but I don't think it has this feature in terms of memory management.

libgap_enter/exit() has nothing really to do with error handling.  The problem with calling our own `longjmp` from within a custom error handler is that it causes GAP's own internal error cleanup (in `CATCH_ERROR` blocks) blocks to be bypassed.

One immediate problem: would that be a `jmp_buf` or a `sigjmp_buf`? What cysignals uses depends on the platform: on Linux and OS X, it's `sigjmp_buf`. On other platforms, it's `jmp_buf`.

Does GAP really have to perform a `longjmp()`? Couldn't we propose to change GAP to use a callback function instead? That would be much more user friendly and it's also how other libraries implement error handling.

If if turns out that this makes error handling difficult when using GAP as a library, then it is our place to question that design choice. I never said that we should drop the `ReadJmpError` thing, we could add the callback as additional error handling mechanism. That's what PARI does for example: it allows a `longjmp()`-based error handler which is mostly for internal use and it has an error callback function which is used by our Python bindings to PARI.

But that would require adding error propagation support to all (at least, a lot) GAP functions, no?

I think I understand what you are saying: there is no way to detect whether the `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` block has ended. I.e. you would want something like

```
TRY_IF_NO_ERROR
{
  enable_error_recovery = 1;

Yes, that's definitely part of it.  After a `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` there's no resetting of the mechanism to disable future jumps to that point.

I had some notes about this further up this already confusing ticket, but for example I had some cases where it was possible, if some error occurred very early on in Sage's libgap API, it could result in a longjmp back to `InitializeGap` (which just happened to be where the last actual `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` was).  What the GAP API needs is some reasonable terminal location to jump to (preferably within the GAP kernel code itself, or possibly the public API code in libgap-api.c) that can set an error indicator and return.

Incidentally, almost all (and there are some exception) of these jumps originate from calls to the function `JUMP_TO_CATCH` (this is where the error callback is called as well), and within GAP almost all calls to `JUMP_TO_CATCH` originate from the default error handler `ErrorInner`, which is implemented in GAP code in `error.g`.  Chris mentioned to me that the GAP test suite runner actually messes with this in some way (I haven't looked yet), and that the GAP Juypter kernel also replaces `ErrorInner`.

And it doesn't look easy to add such a mechanism now.

I would prefer not a "terminal location to jump to" but a callback function to be called.

Concretely, I would suggest the following:

- add a macro to reset `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR`. This could be implemented as `memset(STATE(ReadJmpError), 0, sizeof(syJmp_buf));`

- use this macro in GAP in the relevant places, in particular in `InitializeGap`.

- have a way to check whether we are inside a `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` block or not. Implemented by checking whether `syJmp_buf` consists of all-zero bytes.

- in the GAP error callback in Sage, do the following:
  - if we are inside `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR`: return from the error callback
  - otherwise: call `sig_error`

My thinking is that the `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` stuff should never leak out of the GAP kernel code at all, which is what I meant by a \"terminal location to jump to\"--that is--within GAP's own code.  At this point it would check whether an error occurred, and should have a way of setting some indication of that fact that can be checked easily from third-party code, along with retrieving the error message.  Being able to get a stack trace might be nice too but less important.  I don't think a \"callback function\" is necessary at all, but could also be used I suppose.

I don't see why you would need/want `sig_error` at all.  I'm trying to think about ways this could be usefully implemented for all users of GAP as a library.  My thinking is that the `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` stuff should never leak out of the GAP kernel code at all, which is what I meant by a "terminal location to jump to"--that is--within GAP's own code.  At this point it would check whether an error occurred, and should have a way of setting some indication of that fact that can be checked easily from third-party code, along with retrieving the error message.  Being able to get a stack trace might be nice too but less important.  I don't think a "callback function" is necessary at all, but could also be used I suppose.  Though it would be more useful if said callback function were passed the actual error message, rather than having to wade through `ErrorInner` as we currently do, and read the error message out of a stream object that we're then also responsible for resetting :(

Of course. That's one of the advantages that a callback would give.

A callback function can run arbitrary code. So whatever specific mechanism that you want to use, you could always implement that using a callback. A callback can call `longjmp()` for example. Or a callback could set some global variables that you would want to check later.

It's also pretty standard to have an error callback function: PARI, NTL, GLPK have it.

I found a neat thing while digging around in the GAP code. It seems there is already basically a way to "throw" an "exception" with the `JUMP_TO_CATCH` calls.

`JUMP_TO_CATCH` already accepts a `payload` argument which can be any GAP object. It stows this away in a thread-local state variable called `ThrownObject`.

At the moment there is no particular convention for what should go there, and it is not used at all, for *anything*. But it certainly could be.

Perhaps it was once used for something else. Most existing `JUMP_TO_CATCH` pass some integer between 0 and 3,but the meaning of this is long lost and the GAP git repository doesn't go back far enough to find out what it might have once meant. I'd be curious to dig around on that a bit more.

But I could implement and document a convention for how this is intended to be used, for example, to make the last error message or something like that available. This would be useful as part of my larger vision for cleaning up GAP's error handling.

I think at least some of the problems I'm having now are related to the issue that the old [writeandcheck](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13211#comment:163) patch was intended to fix.  I removed that patch just to see if it was still needed and it seems very much like it is.  That issue is also closely related to the issue I opened here: https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues/3028

I'm going to try re-applying the patch to see if it fixes any of the known problems I'm having, and then will work with the GAP team to find a fix that's acceptable to them.  It's definitely a bug in GAP regardless of interaction with Sage.

There's now `echoandcheck` and `SyWriteandcheck` where are *nearly* exact duplicates of each other except for a minor difference.  The latter seems to be more directly affected but `echoandcheck` might be too.

I cobbled together an updated version of Jeroen's original patch for this, though I'm not exactly sure if that version is gonna fly, since I think there is some deeper cleanup of error handling needed.

The updated patch seems to have helped with some issues, but not others that I was hoping it might fix... :/

Most of these failures fall into a few different categories:

1. Bugs caused by broken syntax error handling, which still needs some fixing.
2. Minor bugs remaining in our GAP interface; in particular places where errors (besides syntax errors) seem to not be handled properly.  I think there are only a couple of these.
3. Missing functionality that was removed from the branch but needs to be restored (particularly a couple test functions in `sage.libs.gap.util`).
4. Tests that depend on some PRNG state that seem to be getting messed up by GAP somehow--I still need to investigate this.
5. Tests that fail due to warnings from GAP that weren't present before.
6. Tests that fail due to actually different mathematical results from GAP, which may still be valid, just different.

There are multiple issues pertaining to error handling and interrupts, so I'm not sure at this point exactly to which you refer.  But to give a brief summary of some of the issues that have been addressed:

1. Right now I'm using `changesignal` from cysignals to unset (and restore originals, if any) the `SIGINT` and `SIGCHLD` handlers installed by GAP during its initialization.  It would be nice to have [another way to do this](https://github.com/sagemath/cysignals/issues/101) but the current method works well-enough.  I would also like to [patch GAP](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/3072) so that this isn't needed in the first place.
   * Related: Since GAP is now not using its own `SIGINT` handler we still wrap all calls to the GAP API with `sig_on()/sig_off()` as this will handle async interrupts, as well as any other unhandled exceptions from GAP.  This is not completely ideal because it means it may be possible to interrupt GAP in critical sections possibly without giving GAP the opportunity to perform its normal interrupt handling.  But AFAICT maybe this isn't such a problem--this was true of the old libgap as well so nothing has really changed here.

2. The `GAP_Enter()` and `GAP_Error_Setjmp()` macro ensures that if a "read error" occurs in GAP--any error that results in a longjmp--that is not already explicitly handled within GAP (e.g. with a `TRY_IF_NO_ERROR` macro), there is a sane place to jump to back in our code.  A Python exception is also set which can be checked by Cython code.  So in other words as long as any GAP code is surrounded by something like:

    ```
    try:
        GAP_Error_Setjmp()  # Or GAP_Enter()
        <libgap calls go here>
    except RuntimeError:
        ...
    ```

   The resulting `RuntimeError` will be handled.  As mentioned in the first point, I still also recommend wrapping all this in `sig_on()/sig_off()` too, as with most any C library code.

   This also requires a [patch to GAP](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/3096) that I hope to get some form of in 4.10.1.  I was also able to get this working (the error handling) without a patch, but the need for managing the "stack bottom" is great enough that we need *that* patch at the very least, and it might as well have the error handling combined into it.

GAP still could use significant refactoring to its error handling and I have some vague plans for that.

For the tests that depend on pseudo-random results it seems GAP is actually not affecting results except for those that come from GAP itself.  It is no surprise that a new version of GAP might mean slightly different results from its own PRNGs and that's probably something we have no control over.  I just need to confirm that the different results are *only* due to changes internal to GAP (and are not affecting other PRNGs in Sage), and then update those tests.

sagelib now does not build for me, the stuff with GAP's `T_INT`, `T_BOOL` etc has not made it into the patches it seems.
I probably can edit headers in local/include/gap/ to work around this.

Another source of test failures I've found--possibly different from the PRNG differences--is that iteration order over a number of objects seems to be different; particularly iterating over some matrix groups.  I'm not sure why, or if it's expected.  But it seems mostly arbitrary--you get the same group elements just in a different order.  For example, in the case of:

```
sage: SGA = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, WeylGroup(["A",3], prefix='s'))
sage: SGA.an_element()
```

I now get

```
s1*s2*s3 + 3*s3*s2 + 2*s3 + 1
```

where previously it returned

```
2*s1*s2*s3*s2*s1 + 3*s1*s2*s3*s1 + s1*s2*s3 + 1
```

This is of course meant to be somewhat arbitrary, though it should be deterministic (and it *is*, the result just changed due to some change in GAP when iterating over the underlying matrix group).

attached fixes all the doctests in src/sage/groups/ (please apply them!)
except one, which is trickier, and stems from broken support for sending to GAP matrices over inexact fields:

```
sage: m=matrix(CC, [[1,2],[3,4]])
sage: libgap(m)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
RuntimeError: Error, Variable: 'Complex' must have a value
Exception RuntimeError: "Error, Variable: 'Complex' must have a value" in 'sage.libs.gap.util.error_handler' ignored
Syntax error: ; expected in stream:1
Complex Field with 53 bits of precision;
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error, Variable: 'bits' must have a value
Error, no method found! For debugging hints type ?Recovery from NoMethodFound
...
Error, no 1st choice method found for `CloseStream' on 1 arguments
gap: panic, could not open *errout*!
```

---
**Edit:** it is just the broken error handling: the current Sage behaviour for this is

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: base ring is not supported by GAP

I think we are in a pretty good shape here - once the error handling in GAP is sorted out, what would remain are few things in `libs/gap/util`, which are strictly speaking not necessary for (lib)gap functionality.

Thanks, I fixed that error just now, and am applying your patches now.  One thing I noticed is that you are just adding some of these new warning messages from GAP to the expected output, like

```
#I  MakeReadWriteGlobal: CosetTableDefaultMaxLimit already read-write
```

Perhaps we should instead fix whatever is causing those messages, or make them silent somehow: It's confusing noise in the context of code that uses GAP somewhere deep down but not in any way that's obvious to users.

these messages are default in new GAP. I prefer to stay close to what GAP does, unless really necessary. I agree that these messages are ugly, but we'd work with upstream on this.

GAP shouldn't be printing *anything* we didn't explicitly ask it to print when used as a library (unless, maybe, the user is directly calling `libgap.eval(...)`).  So if nothing else there should be an option to disable these messages either before a `libgap.eval(...)` or as an optional argument to it.  I don't know exactly where they come from though.

in fact, it's entirely Sage's issue: we have 2 calls like:

```
with libgap.global_context('CosetTableDefaultMaxLimit', limit):
```
in `src/sage/groups/finitely_presented.py` which trigger these, as they
call GAP's `MakeReadWriteGlobal` on already read/write `MakeReadWriteGlobal`.

So this is something for us to fix.

There is (at least) one test that's proving vexing.  In `src/doc/en/constructions/groups.rst`:


```
sage: print(gap.eval("G := SymmetricGroup( 4 )"))
Sym( [ 1 .. 4 ] )
sage: print(gap.eval("normal := NormalSubgroups( G );"))
[ Sym( [ 1 .. 4 ] ), Alt( [ 1 .. 4 ] ), Group([ (1,4)(2,3), (1,2)(3,4) ]),
  Group(()) ]
```

When I run those commands directly in GAP I seem to always get the above result.  However, sometimes this test (just in Sage...?) returns:

```
[ Sym( [ 1 .. 4 ] ), Alt( [ 1 .. 4 ] ), Group([ (1,4)(2,3), (1,3)(2,4) ]),
  Group(()) ]
```

(note the only difference is the second element of the third subgroup).  An equally valid result, but I don't know why this is't entirely deterministic or where the randomness is coming from.

GAP is certainly using (pseudo)randomization in many places, sometimes by default.
I would not be worried here, and change the test to compute orders (24,12,4,1) of these subgroups instead.

But I am still concerned here, because between test runs pseudo-random results *should* still be consistent, unless there is some RNG in GAP that we are now not seeding properly.

IIRC there are few places in Sage that still use `gap` in place of `libgap`, but these should be easy. I think after this ticket and associated GAP packages are done, it's high time to pull GAP pexpect interface.

I guess it must have been broken: I can't see any way that the libgap interface was otherwise being re-seeded.  I am working on a fix.

Yes, I hope so.  This should be done first though.

For some reason I led myself astray by thinking the test that was randomly failing had anything to do with libgap, but it was actually using the pexpect interface in the first place, and it had nothing to do with libgap.

I realized that many of the doctests manually call something like `current_randstate().set_seed_gap()` before calls that use GAP that might involve some random process.  I think that's rather unfortunate, especially for documentation (it raises a distracting question "why do I have to do this first?") so I'm also adding a patch that does this automatically when the GAP interface is used in doctests.

Other than this random seed issue, we're very close to having 100% of the standard doctests passing.

I've fixed this, it was easy. I've pushed  commit 5d3fce on `u/dimpase/GQ` for you to pick.

I think it would be good to resolve #26874 for this ticket, since there are new ways, it seems, that results from GAP can be slightly random.  I think my solution in #26874 is fine, but any other solution that works is fine too.

Got around to opening a PR for the writeandcheck issue: https://github.com/gap-system/gap/pull/3102

As I wrote there, I'm not entirely satisfied with the solution, but it's "good enough for now" for our purposes.

One of the most severe remaining issues is the problem with `all_documented_functions`.  Specifically this one snippet of code, which returns the list of documented global functions (here in plain GAP code):

```
documented_funcs := Filtered(NamesGVars(), IsDocumentedWord);
```

I profiled this by setting `ProfileGlobalFunctions(true);` and then `DisplayProfile();` afterwards.  On GAP 4.8.6 in Sage's devel branch I get:

I have a problem building this branch, with Sage 8.5.rc0, on Debian:
(even tried `make distclean` first, to no avail). Any idea what's wrong?:

I see the problem: The regression isn't in `IsDocumentedWord`, but rather the number of docs being searched.  Right now I'm installing all the officially supported GAP packages, which obviously we should *not* do for base gap SPGK in Sage.  This needs to be fixed.

However, this code should also work on other distributions where any arbitrary number of GAP packages might be installed.  Therefore, it would be good to figure out a way to prevent this code from searching docs for packages, and just limit this to global functions built into GAP by default.

Yikes, sorry about that.  I fixed that locally but I didn't push the fix upstream yet.  It's just a missing include in my patch to libgap-api.h.

This should fix it.  What a sneaky problem though.  I think I will complain about this upstream...

A better solution, I think, would be to allow passing `NULL` as the environment argument to `GAP_Initialize`, in which case GAP can just use the correct `environ`.

I tested this branch on Arch with system-wide GAP and it works almost flawlessly, great job. I only get one test failure, which doesn't look too serious:


```
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/libs/gap/operations.py", line 96, in sage.libs.gap.operations.OperationInspector.operations
Failed example:
    Unknown in x.operations()
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

One further question: since packages would be installed to GAP_DIR/pkg and some of them are compiled binaries, wouldn't it make more sense to put GAP_DIR under SAGE_LOCAL/lib instead of SAGE_LOCAL/share?

I think it's kind of a bug in GAP--something a bit ill-considered and complicated.

GAP's `main()` function is in the somewhat archaic (in that it is not standard, though many unices support it) three argument form:

```
int main ( int argc, char * argv[], char * environ[] )
```

This is used to pass the program's environment variables to the program.  But POSIX-conforming systems don't need this because they have the `char** environ` global variable.  GAP then passes the environment passed via `main(...)` to `GAP_Initialize` which stores a copy of it off to GAP's own global variable `static char **sysenviron` (this all happens in [src/gap.c](https://github.com/gap-system/gap/blob/f759aa59ac48ca81035385da869f49a40df042c2/src/gap.c#L1747)).

It then accesses the environment through the `sysenviron` variable.  Actually the only place this is specifically used is `FuncKERNEL_INFO` in the same file which is called during startup (from `lib/system.g`) to set up some basic system info, including  GAP-level copy of the environment.

This is problematic because functions that modify the environment such as `putenv()` or `setenv()` may require the array of environment variable pointers to be resized (obviously, but I double-checked and while this behavior is implementation-defined it's straightforward: in libc it just effectively does `environ = realloc(new_size)`).  So the value of the global `environ` variable can be changed by the program if you're not careful.  If this happens between the start of the process, and when GAP loops over its `sysenviron` variable you're in trouble, because that's now pointing to some old location of the original `environ` which now points to arbitrary/uninitialized data.  To avoid this the program should always use `environ` directly, rather than saving off some possibly outdated pointer.

It so happened, in this case, that it *almost* worked--the old array that `sysenviron` was pointing to still contained the old environment variables, but its last (`NULL`) entry was already allocated to some other use and would contain some arbitrary value (in my testing it was typically either `0x300` or `0x310`--who knows) hence the segfault.

I believe this is not a problem for GAP normally, as the pointer that's passed to `main()` is already to a copy and not to the actual `environ` array.  But in Sage we were passing the global `environ` to GAP and that's where the problems arise, so we have to make a copy :|

This was a heisenbug, because I had an example case that reliably reproduced the problem when run by itself, but that *worked* when run under gdb.  The reason for this was tricky: There's actually only one place during GAP's initialization that modifies the environment (and even then it only happens if `HAVE_LIBREADLINE` is defined): In the `rl_initialize()` call that initializes readline.  It sets the `COLUMNS` and `LINES` variables if they are not already defined.

The reason the bug didn't occur under gdb, then, is because gdb *itself* uses readline, so when running the program under gdb those variables are already set, and the environment does not get modified, hence no crash when `FuncKERNEL_INFO` tries to read it :(

For all that reason, I think `GAP_Initialize` should accept `NULL` for its environ argument, and if so use the libc `environ` global, and it should do this by default on those systems that support it (most) and not save a (possibly outdated) copy of it.

I hadn't noticed that before.  Indeed, it is just code rot and should be removed.

FWIW the current version of my branch does still have this patch so I don't know what you mean by "putting this patch back".  It's unfortunate that that code path uses the pexpect interface at all.  We still intend to remove that.  I still can't reproduce the problem though.  Does it only happen if you have additional packages installed?  It might be just that the method lookup is too slow.

I am going to continue looking into kernel packages next; I believe the only issue with that is minor but if not then I will postpone it.

I mean I, locally, removed the patch, and it broke Sage, by getting hanging
`DihedralGroup(8).cardinality()`.


> It's unfortunate that that code path uses the pexpect interface at all. 

well, yes, but getting rid of GAP's pexpect is quite a big task, it certainly cannot be
done before this ticket is merged.
 

> We still intend to remove that.  I still can't reproduce the problem though.  Does it only happen if you have additional packages installed?  It might be just that the method lookup is too slow.

Most additional packages are installed just by untarring the canonical GAP 4.10 tarball.
(Some of them also need some compiling done, but these are in minority).

I don't think it is related, it might be that pexpect GAP needs different options for startup, so that package autoloading is not conflicting with pexpect.
This would be an easy fix, otherwise I suppose we will need to keep the patch in question.

OK, with 38e687b90bf (I tested on an older branch) in I can remove build/pkgs/gap/patches/nodefaultpackages.patch and
have  `DihedralGroup(8).cardinality()` running fine.

Of course, now I need to adjust the GAP packages installed, to have at least everything
mentioned in build/pkgs/gap/patches/nodefaultpackages.patch, namely

```
 default:= [ "autpgrp", "alnuth", "crisp", "ctbllib", "factint", "fga",

The xgap package is known to case the pexpect interface to hang.  This was discussed somewhere around[comment:225](#comment%3A225).  A few of the default packages (at least sonata and guava) will load the xgap package if the `-p` flag is set.  I fixed this (see[comment:230](#comment%3A230)) by modifying `sage.g` to prevent loading of the xgap package, but if you have an old workspace from before this patch it will still be loaded.

This won't affect most users of Sage since most users will not have existing workspaces with these packages loaded (if they did, they would be getting hit with this same bug).

Why? This is what I have done on #26856,
having the same default packages autoloaded as GAP does.
I think this is the best, and you seem to have agreed...

> I can find some way to override the default packages when loading GAP with `sage.g` (probably best, if it can be done), or we figure out how best to just silence those warnings.


Why should we diverge from the canonical GAP here? Default autoloaded packages load more efficient routines for a number of tasks, too.

I have already done this on #26856 - including fixing the needed doctests.
The disk space is small in this case, as all them are just GAP code. Apart from tomlib. 

Tomlib was (as of #26856) part of database_gap. 

GAP people really consider these packages core GAP, and keep them packages for historical/authoriship etc reasons.

With bz2 compression this squashes down to 66MB which, while not ideal, is somehow psychologically less troubling than 375MB, perhaps just being ~an order of magnitude smaller. 

With LZMA compression (at the default compression level 6) it gets down to 58MB--this is what I use for the Windows installer.  This will probably make installation take that much longer (decompressing the files from the Windows installer takes quite a long time).  But I'm less concerned about that for now.

Not really, but we've decided to get rid of these optional things, I think. 
[cf. sage-devel thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/JxgpPXjHPNs/wRuFhbyNBAAJ).

It's an extra complication resulting in chasing inconsistencies in GAP resulting from loading a different set of packages, textually different test results (and it annoys upstream).

+1 for a general Python install it would be annoying as the default behavior, but lots of Python apps are using a virtualenv or some other alternate PYTHONPATH with a fixed, unchanging set of packages, and for this case it would be nice to have some kind of "frozen" workspace that can load quicker.  One thing Python does have that GAP doesn't is pre-compiled bytecode modules, which does make a big difference, however.  But it would be nice if one could somehow mark module-level code as "pure", such that it could be stored as a pickle or something without having to re-execute it.  But that's getting off-topic...

Nevermind, this is still broken.  I *had* it working, apparently, but possibly only after some manual tinkering.  I need to figure out what I did previously to fix this.  Maybe I didn't even fix it at all:  `LoadPackage("IO")` works from GAP, but not from `libgap.eval(...)` in Sage :(

I understand the issue with compiled packages now, and it *is* still broken, as nthiery reported originally at https://github.com/markuspf/gap/issues/1 (why on Markus's fork I'm not sure).

This is really more a problem with the build system for the individual compiled packages though, and I'm not sure it's something really within the scope of this ticket (unless there are some generic build package tools in GAP itself that we need to fix, which might be possible; I haven't checked).  The shared libraries for compiled packages really need to be linked against libgap so that the loader can find GAP symbols from libgap.

I'm still slightly surprised by this and would appreciate a detailed explanation if someone can give one.  I'd have assumed that if libgap.so had already been loaded, that the loader would still be able to resolve symbols from it when `dlopen()`-ing the GAP package.  But it seems that in this case a `DT_NEEDED` entry is still needed for some subtle reason that I'm not quite getting.

Okay, so that means this depends on what binding mode libgap itself is opened with when it gets loaded (which likely only happens when one of the Python modules that depends on libgap is loaded).  I'm not sure exactly what that would be, but it appears [sys.setdlopenflags](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.setdlopenflags) might be useful for this purpose.

```

at least on Linux.  In theory it should work on Cygwin and macOS as well but I think that should be tested.

Otherwise, pending any other issues anyone wants to raise, I'm calling this "done".

I see...

What's strange is that if one of the default packages doesn't exist GAP makes a big warning about it, but if it simply is "unavailable" due to some of its dependencies being missing it just quietly does not load that package.

I already asked about means to install the GAP packages that need compilation.
Will we install and keep them in-place, at least for now, is this what you do with GAP's io?

Which ECL ticket?  Can you CC me on that?  I've spent some time in the past working on the ECL integration with Sage.  I didn't know there were still problems with using the system ECL.

So it looks like the cleaning of old files is not done with sufficient force, i.e. the clever uninstallation code fails to clean in such a case on OSX.

Can we add that `rm -rf local/share/gap/` at the start?

I consider it a feature that the installer will fail if it tries to overwrite an existing file and can't, as that's an indication of an issue we'd want to know about (which in this case it was!) but not one we really need to worry about in this case.

Yes, indeed, this is needed as more default packages are now loaded. Probably it makes sense to make #26856 dependence of this one.

Else we should get the needed part of the branch of #26856 into here.

I admit it's a workflow screwup on my side, primarily, as  #26856 does get rid of database_gap, everything related to it must be here now, by right...

I'm trying to package this and in the process updating gap to 4.10. I really wish gap had a workable `make install`.

gap builds and tests fine. It works interactively. However when trying to use it through sage's pexepct interface, it hangs. Any idea what may be going wrong here?

```
sage: a = Gap(logfile = 'gap.log')
sage: a.__dict__
{'_Expect__command': 'gap -r -L /home/timo/.sage/gap/gap-workspace-0x25243fbcd256d4e0 -b -p -T -E -o 622m -s 622m -m 64m  /nix/store/gh48l47qc1irys2xpbwf56g2lwa96pcs-sage-src-8.6.beta0/src/ext/gap/sage.g',

 '_Expect__remote_cleaner': False,
 '_Expect__seq': -1,
 '_Expect__verbose_start': False,

 '_seed': None,
 '_server': None,
 '_session_number': 0,

sage: a('42;') # hangs and doesn't produce a gap.log file
```

Meanwhile executing the `_Expect_command` manually (through `sage -gap`, without `-p` and without `-L`) works as expected.

The main reason I know the pexpect interface can hang is if the xgap package is loaded.  Search the discussion above for "xgap".  This is *supposed* to be fixed by [8228bace](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8228bace651aa07f71baca218d89b8d83e72a9a0) to ensure that the xgap package is not autoloaded.  You'll want to check whether that fix is working as intended though.

It might also help to patch the pexpect interface to not hang in this case, but that's more complicated because it has to "talk" to the GAP interpreter as though it were correctly emulating a graphical interface.  Better to just make sure xgap isn't loaded.

It looke like `PackagesToIgnore`, which just pretends the package doesn't exist, is more robust than `ExcludeFromAutoload`.

I am able to workaround the issue by creating a `~/.gap/gap.ini` file (which for some reason is not actually an ini file) with the contents

```
SetUserPreference( "PackagesToIgnore", [ "xgap" ] );
```

And monkey-patching away the `-r` flag passed to sage:

```
rm -rf ~/.sage/gap; result/bin/sage -c 'import sage.interfaces.gap as g; g.gap_cmd = "gap"; Gap()(42)'
```

That terminates. I wasn't able to do the same with `sage.g` however -- maybe it is just loaded too late? I tried using `SetUserPreference` as well as `GAPInfo.PackagesToIgnore`.

Maybe we could make use of the `--roots` argument to provide a `gap.ini` file?
