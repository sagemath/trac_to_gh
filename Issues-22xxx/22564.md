CC:  @egourgoulhon

The symbolic method used for manifolds and differentiable manifolds is "symbolic", the default in [SageMath](SageMath).
In this ticket we introduce the use of SymPy as an option when the Chart in the manifold is created.

At this point there is a dependence on Sympy ticket:
"sympy to sage conversion : Abstract function."
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/12826

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22801

There are a few things that need fixing.

- Not all methods have docstrings/tests
- There are a number of tests where the line before is informational, but it needs a blankline, e.g.:
  {{{#!diff
`@``@` -1641,6 +1641,19 `@``@` class TopologicalManifold(ManifoldSubset):
             F: U --> R
                (x, y, z) |--> cos(y)*sin(x) + z
 
+
+        Same tests with ``sympy``::
+            sage: c_xyz.set_calculus_method('sympy')
+            sage: f = U.scalar_field(sin(x)*cos(y) + z, name='F'); f
+            Scalar field F on the Open subset U of the 3-dimensional topological manifold M
+            sage: f.display()
+            F: U --> R
+               (x, y, z) |--> cos(y)*sin(x) + z
+
+            sage: type(f.coord_function(c_xyz).expr())
+               <class 'sympy.core.add.Add'>
+
+
}}}
- IMO, you are too liberal with your blanklines spacing things out that makes the code a little uneven to read.

Thanks a lot for these improvements! I'll have a look at the code next week. Just a quick comment: as revealed by the patchbot, there are still some coverage issue, as well as a problem with `sage/manifolds/chart_func.py` when building the documentation. There are also some doctest failures.

I see in the difference the following one:

It is due to a different setting: in the previous version, the transition map `xy_to_uv` was redefined, thereby causing a different handling of computations between `SR` and `sympy`. Note that the two expressions of `a` are mathematically equivalent, which is satisfactory.

The above commit contains some polishing of the code (mostly layout) and improvements in the documentation. In particular, it restores the section the rubric *Differences between chart fucntions and callable symbolic expressions* of the previous class `CoordFunctionSymb`. 

Two questions: 

- Why is there an argument `expression` in method `ChartFunction._simplify`? I mean, if `expression` is not `self.expr(method=calc_method)`, why not calling directly the `simplify` method of `CalculusMethod` on it?

- In the docstring of `ChartFunctionRing._coerce_map_from_`, there is a TODO section with *There is a problem with coercion with rationals*. What is that?

At a particular moment during development I introduced it but I don't remember its functionality. As it is used only internally to `ChartFunction` I will remove this argument.

Look at this example:

```
M = Manifold(2, 'M', structure='topological')
X.<x,y> = M.chart()
f = X.function(x^2+3*y+1)
g = f+1/2

Done in the above commit.

> 2) Are we letting the TODO's remain undone for this release?


IMHO yes, because they require substantial work and do not hinder the functionality implemented here.

> 3) In vectorfield_module.py, two occurrences each of "from the North pole" and "from the South pole" were changed to "from North pole" and "from South pole", respectively, resulting in non-standard English.


Corrected in the above commit; thanks.

Besides the above typos, the last commit restores the trig simplification that was commented out in `simplify_chain_generic_sympy` and `simplify_chain_real_sympy`. On general grounds, the SymPy simplification chain should be improved in another ticket.

I have just uploaded another copy, with a new name, after stripping the output and a few commented-out cells. It should open with the standard upload link in the Sage Notebook. It should run as is, and it should fail after changing Parallelism().set(nproc=1) from 1 to 2.

> Certainly by lack of knowledge... Thanks for your feedback! Can you elaborate a little bit though? Do you mean it is bad to use `expr._maxima_()` for `expr` in `SR`?


This uses `sage/interfaces/interfaces.py` which is pexpect. The libmaxima functionality can be found in `sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py`.

I wonder why `_maxima_lib_()` is used only in few places in the library code, as opposed to `_maxima_()`. Should one open a ticket to modify all these places?
