We probably want to have `.chromatic_index` as a graph method.
We already have `.fractional_chromatic_index` as a graph method (see #10044), and `.chromatic_number` as a graph method. It only makes sense to have `.chromatic_index` as a graph method as well, instead of doing something like

```python
graph_coloring.edge_coloring(g, value_only=True)
```

<a id='comment:10'>**Comment 10:**</a>
I've looked over things a little bit, still need to look over the code more carefully and try to break things.

In terms of the docstrings, for `chromatic_index()`:
- I think that mentioning that the method is a front-end and the `See also:` should be placed after `INPUT:`, but before `EXAMPLES:`.

- I don't think there's much of a point to doing `n=randint(3,6)`, because I believe Sage always uses the same initial seed for random number generation in tests. Which means it won't succeed in finding errors like...

- Chromatic index of a complete graph K_n is equal to n if n is odd, and n-1 if n is even. It is not always equal to n as stated. Presumably doctests are always "randomly" picking n to be 3 or 5, since they never pick this up.

- I think instead of having two examples with the path graph, it might be better to do one example with the path graph, and one or two examples with more 'exotic' graphs (Maybe petersen graph and some graph that isn't regular?).

For `edge_coloring()`:

- There needs to be some examples in the documentation showing/testing what happens when `value_only=False` and an edge partition is returned.

- It's also not entirely clear from the documentation what is supposed to happen when `hex_colors=False`.

Just realized that the `edge_coloring()` was already in Sage and not really part of this ticket...so I guess only do that if you're feeling particularly expeditious :) .

I addressed all your comments. It's true that the `edge_coloring` method was lacking of examples.
On my side it passes all tests and I can build/display properly the doc. Hope it's the same for you.

Hi Frédéric,

if you have any idea what's going on here, please let us know. 
I tried to follow all rules for the formatting of blocks, but the patchbot is complaining. On my side, I can successfully build the documentation and it displays well.

Thanks,
David.
