as a step to python3

BEWARE: this file will need later a much deeper treatment, because the current behaviour is not possible in python3 (cmp is not the same order as rich comparison)

the current ticket only aims at removing calls to cmp in the code, so that it compiles with cython/python3

In this case, the behaviour looks meaningful so it's a change in the good sense.
