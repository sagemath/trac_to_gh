Install both pip2 and pip3, otherwise your python2 + python3 isn't that useful.

Then, let sage-pip-install explicitly use pip2 or pip3.

With this ticket the SAGE_PYTHON3=yes build only fails in sagelib, but works for all dependencies.

This ticket also updates numpy to version 1.12.1.

If I just install Sage's `python3` and its dependencies, then `python3 -m pip` tells me `No module named pip`, probably because I'm on OS X without `openssl`. That's an advantage to Sage's `pip`: it doesn't require Python's `ssl` module. So I say we should install it even with Python 3.

I see the same error. I think the problem is a race condition between `python2` and `python3`: whichever one is built second creates a symlink `local/bin/python`, and that version of python is used to execute the script `build/pkgs/numpy/lapack_conf.py`. In my case, the link points to `python2`, which is not the right one if you have `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

This doesn't fix the race condition, so sometimes `python` will point to `python2`, sometimes to `python3`. This will affect any packages that use `python setup.py` in their `spkg-install`, for example:

```
$ grep -R 'python setup' build/pkgs
./gambit/spkg-install:python setup.py --no-user-cfg build install
./numpy/spkg-install:sage-python setup.py \
./pillow/spkg-install:python setup.py \
./pycrypto/spkg-check:python setup.py test
./python_igraph/spkg-check:python setup.py check
./scons/spkg-install:python setup.py --no-user-cfg install
```
There are going to be other potential issues. See for example zn_poly's spkg-install:

```
# use 2to3 if we are running on python3
if python -c 'import sys; sys.exit(sys.version_info.major != 3)'; then
    2to3 -n -w --no-diffs makemakefile.py
fi
```
I think either we need to not create the symlink pointing to python3 in the python3 spkg-install and fix any resulting issues, or (my preference) we need to make sure the symlink points to the correct python by creating the appropriate symlink also in the *python2* spkg-install, in case it gets built second.

Edit: run

```
grep -R -w python build/pkgs --include spkg-install
```
to see instances of `python` in spkg-install scripts. There will be more instances in spkg-check or other scripts, like matplotlib's make-setup-config.py. Having the symlink always point to python2 will require fixing all of these, and it will also make Sage harder to maintain.

* Its easiest to just switch the python symlink at build time
vs 
* pep 394 says: *The more general python command should be installed whenever any version of Python 2 is installed and should invoke the same version of Python as the python2 command*
* switching the python symlink introduces state (so you can't build other packages with and without SAGE_PYTHON3)
* distributions may or may not have python symlink to python2 
I have a slight perference for the latter, tough I'm open for discussing this

Not all of the occurences of python in build/ are issues; Ideally such scripts are version-independent and work with either the system python or Sage's python2/3. 
* matplotlib/make-setup-config.py needlessly depends on six and could easily be version-independent
* Calls to "python setup.py" should be replaced with sage-pip-install anyways

I am not quite persuaded by PEP 394, since we're not really installing Python for general use; we're installing it for use within a specific environment, the Sage build environment.

Also, I agree that cleaning up things like `python setup.py --> sage-pip-install` would be great. For what it's worth, note that running `matplotlib/make-setup-config.py` with python3 led to the discovery of a minor bug -- see #22772.

The numpy builds also fails with the error `ImportError: No module named numpy`, I think because of this in spkg-install:

```
# Touch all includes such that dependency checking works properly:
# the timestamp of the includes should be *now*, not the time when
# the numpy package was created.
python <<EOF
import os
os.chdir(os.environ["SAGE_ROOT"])  # Import numpy from safe location
import numpy
os.chdir(numpy.get_include())
os.system("touch numpy/*")
EOF
```
Easy enough to fix with your proposal: change `python` to `sage_python`.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A35):
> Its a bit premature to worry about how to run sage-on-python3, but one possibility would be to have a specific sage3 command. Using an environment variable doesn't sound clean to me.


Why not try to plan ahead?

As things stand, to run sage-on-python3, you would have to build with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` first, in which case sage-on-python2 will not work. So the build-time and run-time choices of Python version have to match up. I guess we could build everything for both Python 2 and 3, but that seems like a waste of space.

Some more changes: some `spkg-check` scripts were using `python` and should use `sage-python23` instead: if we're building with it, we should test with it. Some optional packages also needed some modifications. I haven't tested these changes yet.

A few questions:

- when we build `git`, we pass the configure option `--with-python="$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/python`. Does this matter? Does anyone use Sage's git as opposed to the system git?

- in the IPython `spkg-install` script, there is a test to see if `python` is version 3 or not:

```
# add symlink if we are running on python3
if python -c 'import sys; sys.exit(sys.version_info.major != 3)'; then
    cd "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin
    rm -f ipython
    ln -s ipython3 ipython
fi
```
 Keep this as is, or test instead whether `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, or delete the whole block?

With no symlink `local/lib/python` pointing to `local/lib/python3.5`? As Volker points out, brial's file `configure.ac` has the line

```
AM_PATH_PYTHON([2.7])
```
For me, brial gets installed in `local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, regardless of the variable `SAGE_PYTHON3`, if I'm building with this branch and the one from #22764.

(Google pointed me to this ticket, so I'm leaving this comment to help, in case someone encounters this.)

I ran into the same problem while updating to 9.0beta8 (including the update to python3).

Force installing python3 with

```
sage -f python3
```
(as pointed out above) solved it in my case. I did run `make dist-clean` and `./configure` in case anyone wonders.
