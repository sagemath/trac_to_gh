This ticket brings:

- a catalog of axioms `axioms.XXX` in the global namespace

- axioms as objects rather than plain strings. This had been wished
  for during the review #10963, and some of the code is reminiscent of
  Volker's draft at #15501. The main advantage for now is to enable
  the definition of axioms with custom printing, thus getting rid of the
  crapy monolithic customization section.

  The bijection axiom <-> "axiom name" remains mandatory to support
  the syntax for implementing axioms in a category.

- improved heuristic for printing categories with axioms. E.g.:

  ```
  Category of finite enumerated fields  ->  Category of finite fields
  Category of finite enumerated permutation groups  ->  Category of finite permutation groups
  ```

  improved printing of `AssociativeXXX`:

  ```
  Category of additive commutative additive magmas ->
  Category of additive-commutative additive magmas
  ```
  This was discussed and requested on sage-devel for better
  readability when there are many axioms printed. E.g. in

  ```
  sage: Semirings().super_categories()[0]
  Category of associative additive-commutative additive-associative additive-unital distributive magmas and additive magmas
  ```

  The above are the reasons why the commits touch many files)

- some simplifications in the code (e.g. no more `_repr_object_names_static`)

The code is essentially backward compatible, at the price of having
`axioms.Associative == "Associative"`, with compatible hash values.
Using axioms as strings is deprecated in code. In particular, the
ticket updates the Sage library in a few places to use the preferred
idiom `P in C.Axiom` rather than `"Axiom" in P.category().axioms()`.


Remaining questions:


- Inside the code, do we want to call the catalog of axioms
  `all_axioms` or `axioms`? The latter is more ambiguous,
  but consistent with the name exported in global name space.

- To fetch an existing axiom from a variable containing either the
  axiom or its name, the current idiom is `all_axioms(name)`; that's
  somewhat consistent with the `P(xx)` idiom to create elements of a
  parent. Would we want some other idiom? `all_axioms[name]`?

- Do we want to implement a `cmp` method for axioms?
  - Comparing by string: this could avoid the repeated use of
    `sorted(...,key=str)` in our documentation
  - Comparing by index/definition time? This would be plausibly more
    meaningful (axioms shown in some natural order). And simplify
    a very tiny bit the one place where this sorting order is used in
    the code.

- Do we want to Cythonize axiom.py? Now? Later?

- Do we want to import `all_axioms` from `category_with_axiom` rather than
  `axiom`? This would avoid a double import in all the files specifying
  `_base_category_and_axiom`

- Do we want "additive magmas" to be renamed to "additive-magmas" for consistency?

- Do we want to fix the inconsistency below by adding `additive-` in
  the first output?

  ```
  sage: CommutativeAdditiveGroups()
  Category of commutative additive groups
  sage: AdditiveMagmas().AdditiveCommutative()
  Category of additive-commutative additive magmas
  ```

- To recover the string associated to an axiom in the code, is it fine
  to use `str(axiom)`, or do we want something more explicit and
  possibly distinct from printing like `axiom.name()`?

- Any better name for `axiom.index()`? It's only used internally,
  and in a single place; we could also just use `axiom._index`.


Work for followup tickets:

- Improve the guessing to avoid having to specify
  `_base_category_class_and_axiom` in
  `FiniteDimensionalLieAlgebrasWithBasis` and friends.

- Improve the pretty printing to get:

  ```
  Category of associative additive-commutative additive-associative additive-unital distributive magmas and additive magmas
  ->
  Category of distributive semigroups and additive-commutative additive monoids
  ```

That's a good question. The `__eq__` and `__hash__` are really here just for backward compatibility (supporting the idiom `"Foo" in C.axioms()`). I used `UniqueRepresentation` because that's really what I mean :-) But you are right, it could be more proper to use `CachedRepresentation`.

<a id='comment:17'>Comment 17:</a>
If you want to keep the `__eq__`, then you really need to define a `__ne__` to keep things consistent in case someone wants to test inequality. A slightly contrived example, but say someone has a constructor that accepts an axiom as an arg and they want to do something special when the axiom is not `axioms.Commutative`.

Also, `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `index` of `Axiom` do not have doctests.

I say `axioms` both for consistency and naturality.

I would go for the latter since it is a container object and `all_axioms[name]` is how Python handles other container objects, e.g., `dict`.

No, but rich comparisons are good.

Definitely Index/definition time as this will allow us to control the printing in a more straightforward way.

I am inclined to say Cythonize it to keep the categories as fast as possible. I feel like even if highly optimized, this switch will slow down category creation because the string operations are lightweight and optimized at the machine level. However, I haven't done any timings.

Also, it would be good if you could get rid of the `SageObject` inheritance from `Axiom` so we could `cdef` it, and I don't see axioms fundamentally behaving like other instances of `SageObject`.

I don't think the hyphen there is completely grammatically correct, at least it is strange to me. So I'm -1.

I would like the latter to be

```
Category of commutative additive magmas
```
as this is more concise and easier to parse.

> - To recover the string associated to an axiom in the code, is it fine
>   to use `str(axiom)`, or do we want something more explicit and

`str(axiom)` is the most natural for me, but it doesn't hurt to have an alias `axiom.name()`.

> - Any better name for `axiom.index()`? It's only used internally,
>   and in a single place; we could also just use `axiom._index`.

I would get rid of it all together and (mildly) break encapsulation here by using `axiom._index`. It is both faster, only done in one place, and is an implementation detail.
