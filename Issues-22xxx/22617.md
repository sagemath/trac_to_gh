There is currently an old cython example in `cython.py` that relies on the location of the header has installed in sage (which is different from upstream - at least in singular-4.1.0.p1). Gentoo and probably other distro respect upstream layout which causes doctest to fail.

```
        sage: code = [
        ....: "#clang C++",
        ....: "#clib m readline Singular givaro ntl gmpxx gmp",
        ....: "from sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular cimport MPolynomial_libsingular",
        ....: "from sage.libs.singular.polynomial cimport singular_polynomial_pow",
        ....: "def test(MPolynomial_libsingular p):",
        ....: "    singular_polynomial_pow(&p._poly, p._poly, 2, p._parent_ring)"]
        sage: cython(os.linesep.join(code))
```

Since singular provides a .pc file it can be made irrelevant by calling pkgconfig. We can also use the opportunity to clean the libraries used, some of which are not relevant anymore.

I totally *disagree* that using Sage-specific things like `#cargs` is a better practice, but I can live with it as temporary work-around.

It may be a bit hacky but it is the better option. Passing the macros is a pita and `pkgconfig.cflags` give them in the right format. I could isolate the macros from the include one way or another. But ultimately `cinclude` will feed into distutils `include_dirs` which in my opinion has a defect that make it unsuitable for "programatic use".

I'll grant you that's a hack , but it is still better practice to use the .pc file when it is available rather than sprinkling random libraries and include dir. That's the "better practice" I am talking about :)
