[This report on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ZJwOsmPB99Y) purports to have a  bug in this method.  I haven't checked this myself because it depends on an optional package.

```
g1=Graph({0:[1,4],1:[0,2,4],2: [1,3,4],3:[2],4:[0,1,2]});g2=Graph({0:[1],1:[0,2,4],2:[1,3,4 ],3:[2,4],4:[1,2,3]}) 
#g1.show();g2.show(); 
#[1,4] is a module of g1 so g1 is not prime 
#[2,4] is a module of g2 so g2 is not prime 
g2.is_isomorphic(g1), g1.is_prime(),g2.is_prime() 

This is a counter-example with two isomorphic graphs g1 and g2 on
5 vertices giving two different results with the function "is prime".
