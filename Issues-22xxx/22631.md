It turns out that the matplotlib patch we use for `Disk` supports plotting an annulus/ring as well.  See [this example page](http://matthiaseisen.com/matplotlib/shapes/wedge/#partial-wedge) and the [render on subplot method](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/plot/disk.py#n149) for Disk where this could easily be instituted.  We'd need the documentation to make it very clear one can get a (partial) ring/annulus this way.

What I meant was to modify the `Disk` function to allow for using this functionality already built in the matplotlib patch.  This example would make more sense on #22615.
