CC:  @roed314 @xcaruso

In the following example, the category should be `NumberFields()`

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(x^2 + 1)
sage: K.hom([a]).category_for()
Category of rings
```

Why would we ignore the cat keyword? Maybe category support was not that great at the time? Let's see what the patchbot thinks.
