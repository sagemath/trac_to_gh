The functionality of `deprecated_callable_import` can be achieved in a simpler and more general way by a lazy import with deprecation.

So we remove `deprecated_callable_import` in this ticket and remove existing uses coming from #17034, #17867, #19096, #19315. Only one deprecation from #20908 remains.

I think that `import lazy_import as _lazy_import` is better, because there are less chances for mistakes (one could easily forget to add the `del lazy_import` or accidentally remove that statement).
