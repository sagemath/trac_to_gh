Currently, when asking for similarity of matrices over a field, we are not able to return the transformation matrix.

This is because the `rational_form` algorithm cannot do that.

Here is another canonical form, the `generalized_jordan_form`, that can do that.

WARNING: this is in a preliminary state. There is a subtle mathematical point that needs to be understood..
