Following up on #22452 (Create a Polymake pexpect interface): 

In `polymake.py`, `Polymake._keyboard_interrupt passes` a bad first argument in the line

```
i = self._expect.expect_list(self._prompt, timeout=1)
```

This leads to:

I do not know how to reproduce this consistently. It involves pressing C-c at the right moment.
