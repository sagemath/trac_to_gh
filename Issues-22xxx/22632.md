<a id='comment:3'></a>I Travis,

I'm curious, is there any performance gain. I had the impression that storing everything in python dict simply kills all possibilities of optimization ? 

We discussed during past sage days, to re-implement combinatorial free modules, using arrays with a global dict for all object used only during input and output and not during linear algebra.

<a id='comment:5'></a>There seems to be a little bit with doing basic operations:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.94 ms per loop
```
While it's not much, it is something like a 10-15% speedup, but it is something likely to be called a significant number of times. It's even more so for scalar multiplication:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.49 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 3.42 ms per loop
```
I might even be able to get some more speed if I am smarter in how we create the results of, e.g., `_add_`.

```

Plausibly the explanation around that change needs to be updated a bit: there remains no "normal" attribute in this example. Maybe `el.foo=1` could be issued before, and a comment added after that `_monomial_coefficients` is a Cython attribute?

In general, this seems to be calling for changing the running example for this tutorial. The current one is a bit complicated. But that's for a later ticket.

I see it as merely providing a sane default which works generically
but can be overridden at will. Anyway, that's admittedly out of scope
for this ticket; we can decide later on.

Ok!

Out of curiosity, I am now going to have a quick look at the inheritance thing of

Inconvenient:

I believe it's worth it. What do you think?

Good point. Fixed. This prompted me to move the

<a id='comment:48'></a>For the other failure: it stems from the fact that the created element
class's name is set to reflect that it's the element class of a given
parent:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().example()
sage: A.element_class
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However the work is half baked, since the module is not set
accordingly: there is no class
`sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra`; the module part comes from
`CombinatorialFreeModuleElement.__module__` (I am running this example
without the ticket). With the `...Element` being moved, the module
part gets changed to `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_element`.

Two options:
- Not care and just update the doctests
- Improve the output of the element class by setting the module of the
  parent as module.

I just implemented the latter to check that it worked. The end result
is more consistent for the user; here we get:

```
<class 'sage.categories.examples.algebras_with_basis.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However changing `__module__` might possibly break some introspection
stuff (I checked `A.element_class??`, and that was fine). It will also
require updating other doctests.

What do you think?

<a id='comment:72'></a>Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for running this interesting experiment!

I indeed would have been expecting things not too break too much. Systematically using dynamic classes would certainly simplify Sage's infrastructure. The only potential reason for not doing it is performance (speed and memory footprint). At the time we set this up, there was some consensual claim that systematically using a dynamic class would induce a performance loss for low granularity objects (e.g. finite field elements). Hence the above rule of thumb I implemented for deciding when to do what.

However I don't remember anyone doing some serious benchmarking to actually assess the validity of that claim. That would be very welcome! And this hints again at having some speed-regression test infrastructure for Sage.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

PS: I could imagine code breaking in situations like:

```
cdef class MyElement:
    ....

cdef foo(MyElement x):
    x.bar()
```

where `foo` would be called on an instance of a dynamic subclass of `MyElement`, and `foo` be provided by some category.

Apparently we have no instance of that idiom in Sage :-)

```
    cdef _add_(self, other):

Every other class (except for `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and `LieAlgebraElement`) implements those as `cpdef _add_`.

This is confusing because

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
sage: el._add_(el)

It also prevents a Python class inheriting from `IndexedFreeModuleElement` to override this `_add_`.
