I Travis,

I'm curious, is there any performance gain. I had the impression that storing everything in python dict simply kills all possibilities of optimization ? 

We discussed during past sage days, to re-implement combinatorial free modules, using arrays with a global dict for all object used only during input and output and not during linear algebra.

There seems to be a little bit with doing basic operations:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.94 ms per loop
```
While it's not much, it is something like a 10-15% speedup, but it is something likely to be called a significant number of times. It's even more so for scalar multiplication:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.49 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 3.42 ms per loop
```
I might even be able to get some more speed if I am smarter in how we create the results of, e.g., `_add_`.

That gives a very nice speed boost:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
....: x = sum(C.basis())
....: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
....: 
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.84 ms per loop
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
```
Now those Python calls become relatively expensive, so we should avoid them.

Thanks; I did a second pass on it. Good to go.

I see it as merely providing a sane default which works generically
but can be overridden at will. Anyway, that's admittedly out of scope
for this ticket; we can decide later on.

Sounds good.

Yup, exactly.

Ok!

Out of curiosity, I am now going to have a quick look at the inheritance thing of
comment:20. Other than that, it's good to go; thanks for all the hard
work!

- A bit simpler: no distinction anymore between `CFF.Element` and `IndexedFreeModuleElement`. In particular there is no risk to have someone use directly IndexedFreeModule without inheriting from it.
- Avoids a double inheritance, with CFF.element_class deriving from CFF.Element itself deriving from `IndexedFreeModuleElement`

Inconvenient:
- requires to override element_class

I believe it's worth it. What do you think?

I am not so convinced as it hides a fault in a non-trivial way; it something that we should not need to do. I do agree it is more simple. Nevertheless, one should typically use a subclass of the `CFM.Element` when subclassing `CFM` and needing a new element class if they want to use the same data structures. Although I don't think there is too much difference between our two hacks.

Also, in some ways it almost looks like you are moving the unpickling to a completely unrelated class since

```
register_unpickle_override("sage.combinat.free_module",
                           "CombinatorialFreeModuleElement",
                           CombinatorialFreeModule.Element)
```
If you want the `__setstate__` in `IndexedFreeModuleElement`, then this `register_unpickle_override` should redirect to that.

Ok. I agree, it's minor anyway.

Good point. Fixed. This prompted me to move the
`register_unpickle_overide` next to `IndexedFreeModuleElement`.

Sorry for the forced-push; I had screwed up my commit just before.

Altogether, I believe this is good to go!

For the other failure: it stems from the fact that the created element
class's name is set to reflect that it's the element class of a given
parent:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().example()
sage: A.element_class
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However the work is half baked, since the module is not set
accordingly: there is no class
`sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra`; the module part comes from
`CombinatorialFreeModuleElement.__module__` (I am running this example
without the ticket). With the `...Element` being moved, the module
part gets changed to `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_element`.

Two options:
- Not care and just update the doctests
- Improve the output of the element class by setting the module of the
  parent as module.

I just implemented the latter to check that it worked. The end result
is more consistent for the user; here we get:

```
<class 'sage.categories.examples.algebras_with_basis.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However changing `__module__` might possibly break some introspection
stuff (I checked `A.element_class??`, and that was fine). It will also
require updating other doctests.

What do you think?

Thanks. That answers the factual question ("how is it done?") but not really the reason.

There are many differences between Python and Cython classes and I'm trying to understand which property matters here. I am asking because I tried to *always* use the dynamic class (using `inherit=True` in `__make_element_class__` even for Cython element classes) and there is not much that breaks.

These are the main differences between Python and Cython classes that I can think of:

1. The fact that `__class__` can be assigned to for Python classes (I don't think this is the reason here)

2. The fact that Python classes have a `__dict__` (this is no longer true: Python classes with `__slots__` don't have a `__dict__` by default and Cython classes do support `__dict__` if you declare it as attribute)

3. The fact that Python classes always support multiple inheritance, which may or may not work for Cython classes

4. Pickling (although Cython 0.26 does support pickling of Cython classes)

5. Various performance differences

6. ...

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for running this interesting experiment!

I indeed would have been expecting things not too break too much. Systematically using dynamic classes would certainly simplify Sage's infrastructure. The only potential reason for not doing it is performance (speed and memory footprint). At the time we set this up, there was some consensual claim that systematically using a dynamic class would induce a performance loss for low granularity objects (e.g. finite field elements). Hence the above rule of thumb I implemented for deciding when to do what.

However I don't remember anyone doing some serious benchmarking to actually assess the validity of that claim. That would be very welcome! And this hints again at having some speed-regression test infrastructure for Sage.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

PS: I could imagine code breaking in situations like:

```
cdef class MyElement:
    ....

cdef foo(MyElement x):
    x.bar()
```

where `foo` would be called on an instance of a dynamic subclass of `MyElement`, and `foo` be provided by some category.

Apparently we have no instance of that idiom in Sage :-)

```
Some particular actions modify the data structure of ``el``::

    sage: el.rename("bla")
    sage: el
    bla

.. note::

    The class is stored in a particular attribute called ``__class__``,
    and the normal attributes are stored in a dictionary called ``__dict__``::

        sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
        sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
        sage: el.rename("foo")
        sage: el.blah = 42
        sage: el.__class__
        <class 'sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class'>
        sage: el.__dict__

Another question about this ticket: why are the arithmetic methods of `IndexedFreeModuleElement` implemented as `cdef` instead of `cpdef`?

```
    cdef _add_(self, other):
```
Every other class (except for `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and `LieAlgebraElement`) implements those as `cpdef _add_`.

This is confusing because

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
sage: el._add_(el)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-31-91def7298b70> in <module>()
----> 1 el._add_(el)

TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

It also prevents a Python class inheriting from `IndexedFreeModuleElement` to override this `_add_`.
