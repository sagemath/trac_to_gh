We move `CombintorialFreeModuleElement` to its own class `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and cythonize it for (future) speed gains.

I Travis,

I'm curious, is there any performance gain. I had the impression that storing everything in python dict simply kills all possibilities of optimization ? 

We discussed during past sage days, to re-implement combinatorial free modules, using arrays with a global dict for all object used only during input and output and not during linear algebra.

There seems to be a little bit with doing basic operations:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.94 ms per loop
```
While it's not much, it is something like a 10-15% speedup, but it is something likely to be called a significant number of times. It's even more so for scalar multiplication:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.49 ms per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 3.42 ms per loop
```
I might even be able to get some more speed if I am smarter in how we create the results of, e.g., `_add_`.

That gives a very nice speed boost:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
....: x = sum(C.basis())
....: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
....: 
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.84 ms per loop
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
```
Now those Python calls become relatively expensive, so we should avoid them.

Plausibly the explanation around that change needs to be updated a bit: there remains no "normal" attribute in this example. Maybe `el.foo=1` could be issued before, and a comment added after that `_monomial_coefficients` is a Cython attribute?

In general, this seems to be calling for changing the running example for this tutorial. The current one is a bit complicated. But that's for a later ticket.

Thanks; I did a second pass on it. Good to go.

> - [comment:22](#comment%3A22) -1 as that is a little too close to enforcing elements being printed as sums, which is not what we want.

I see it as merely providing a sane default which works generically
but can be overridden at will. Anyway, that's admittedly out of scope
for this ticket; we can decide later on.

> - [comment:23](#comment%3A23) I changed the file name to `indexed_element` as `element` is too generic for my tastes, but I left the class name the same.

Sounds good.

> it was never imported into the global namespace.

Yup, exactly.

> At this point, I think we should reference both and let the user decide.

Ok!

Out of curiosity, I am now going to have a quick look at the inheritance thing of
comment:20. Other than that, it's good to go; thanks for all the hard
work!

- Avoids a double inheritance, with CFF.element_class deriving from CFF.Element itself deriving from `IndexedFreeModuleElement`

Inconvenient:

I believe it's worth it. What do you think?

I am not so convinced as it hides a fault in a non-trivial way; it something that we should not need to do. I do agree it is more simple. Nevertheless, one should typically use a subclass of the `CFM.Element` when subclassing `CFM` and needing a new element class if they want to use the same data structures. Although I don't think there is too much difference between our two hacks.

Also, in some ways it almost looks like you are moving the unpickling to a completely unrelated class since

```
register_unpickle_override("sage.combinat.free_module",
                           "CombinatorialFreeModuleElement",
                           CombinatorialFreeModule.Element)
```
If you want the `__setstate__` in `IndexedFreeModuleElement`, then this `register_unpickle_override` should redirect to that.

Good point. Fixed. This prompted me to move the

Sorry for the forced-push; I had screwed up my commit just before.

Altogether, I believe this is good to go!

The problem comes from the fact that Laurent polynomials are not in Euclidean domains. There are also a number of natural rings that are not Euclidean domains, but have a `quo_rem` that we could at least try this with (e.g., **Z**[x]). So I'm thinking of demoting it back down from the category.

<a id='comment:48'>Comment 48:</a>
For the other failure: it stems from the fact that the created element
class's name is set to reflect that it's the element class of a given
parent:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().example()
sage: A.element_class
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However the work is half baked, since the module is not set
accordingly: there is no class
`sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra`; the module part comes from
`CombinatorialFreeModuleElement.__module__` (I am running this example
without the ticket). With the `...Element` being moved, the module
part gets changed to `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_element`.

Two options:
- Not care and just update the doctests
- Improve the output of the element class by setting the module of the
  parent as module.

I just implemented the latter to check that it worked. The end result
is more consistent for the user; here we get:

```
<class 'sage.categories.examples.algebras_with_basis.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```

However changing `__module__` might possibly break some introspection
stuff (I checked `A.element_class??`, and that was fine). It will also
require updating other doctests.

What do you think?

I am trying to understand how/why `is_extension_type` is used in Sage. In other places in `parent.pyx`, it is to determine whether `__class__` can be assigned to. But in `__make_element_class__`, it's not so clear to me.

Thanks. That answers the factual question ("how is it done?") but not really the reason.

There are many differences between Python and Cython classes and I'm trying to understand which property matters here. I am asking because I tried to *always* use the dynamic class (using `inherit=True` in `__make_element_class__` even for Cython element classes) and there is not much that breaks.

These are the main differences between Python and Cython classes that I can think of:

1. The fact that `__class__` can be assigned to for Python classes (I don't think this is the reason here)

2. The fact that Python classes have a `__dict__` (this is no longer true: Python classes with `__slots__` don't have a `__dict__` by default and Cython classes do support `__dict__` if you declare it as attribute)

3. The fact that Python classes always support multiple inheritance, which may or may not work for Cython classes

4. Pickling (although Cython 0.26 does support pickling of Cython classes)

5. Various performance differences

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for running this interesting experiment!

I indeed would have been expecting things not too break too much. Systematically using dynamic classes would certainly simplify Sage's infrastructure. The only potential reason for not doing it is performance (speed and memory footprint). At the time we set this up, there was some consensual claim that systematically using a dynamic class would induce a performance loss for low granularity objects (e.g. finite field elements). Hence the above rule of thumb I implemented for deciding when to do what.

However I don't remember anyone doing some serious benchmarking to actually assess the validity of that claim. That would be very welcome! And this hints again at having some speed-regression test infrastructure for Sage.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

PS: I could imagine code breaking in situations like:

```
cdef class MyElement:
    ....

cdef foo(MyElement x):
    x.bar()
```

where `foo` would be called on an instance of a dynamic subclass of `MyElement`, and `foo` be provided by some category.

Apparently we have no instance of that idiom in Sage :-)

Comments on this actual ticket: contrary to most element classes which are implemented in Cython, it seems that `CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class` actually does do the inheritance from the category in the "normal" way, using `dynamic_class()`, just like Python classes.

In the light of #23435, is it important that `CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class` has a `__dict__`? In other words, is it important to support the following (example taken from `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-objects-and-classes.rst`):

```
Some particular actions modify the data structure of ``el``::

    sage: el.rename("bla")
    sage: el
    bla

.. note::

    The class is stored in a particular attribute called ``__class__``,
    and the normal attributes are stored in a dictionary called ``__dict__``::

        sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
        sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
        sage: el.rename("foo")
        sage: el.blah = 42
        sage: el.__class__
        <class 'sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class'>
        sage: el.__dict__
        {'__custom_name': 'foo',
         'blah': 42}
```

Another question about this ticket: why are the arithmetic methods of `IndexedFreeModuleElement` implemented as `cdef` instead of `cpdef`?

```
    cdef _add_(self, other):
```
Every other class (except for `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and `LieAlgebraElement`) implements those as `cpdef _add_`.

This is confusing because

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
sage: el._add_(el)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-31-91def7298b70> in <module>()
----> 1 el._add_(el)

TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```

It also prevents a Python class inheriting from `IndexedFreeModuleElement` to override this `_add_`.
