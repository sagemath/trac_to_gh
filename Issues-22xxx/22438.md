Instead of trying to figure out whether to run `unlink()` or `rmtree()`, why not use EAFP principles and use `try`/`except`? Something like

```
try:
    os.unlink(path)
except OSError:
    try:
        shutil.rmtree(path)
    except OSError:
        if os.path.lexists(path):
            raise
```

PS: I sometimes wonder why Python makes it so hard to implement common shell commands like `rm -rf` or `mkdir -p` correctly.

I realised the previous version (in[comment:10](#comment%3A10)) is wrong, here is an updated version. If you don't like it, I can also do the longer EAFP version that you posted earlier.

I actually think the first one (my original commit) is best, it's slightly long-winded but at least the error messages are exact. With both this recent version and your EAFP version, the error messages could be misleading, e.g.

Recent version:
- real problem: grand-child file can't be removed because child directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is a directory

EAFP version:
- real problem: parent directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is not a directory
