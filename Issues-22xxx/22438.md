Otherwise the build fails if the symlink is already there but points to a non-existing path.

I actually think the first one (my original commit) is best, it's slightly long-winded but at least the error messages are exact. With both this recent version and your EAFP version, the error messages could be misleading, e.g.

Recent version:
- real problem: grand-child file can't be removed because child directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is a directory

EAFP version:
- real problem: parent directory is not writable
- raised error: static_dir is not a directory
