It should be under `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/cygSingular-<version>.dll`.  Rather than guess at the version the attached patch just takes the latest one (which will normally be the only one).  It's pretty hacky, but then so is this code on other platforms too.

For the purposes of the standard Sage distribution this should generally work though.

`build/pkgs/singular/spkg-install` has this wonderful part:

```sh
remove_old_version()
{   
    # the following is a little verbose but it ensures we leave no trace of 3.x
    # _or_ 4.x
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/*Singular*
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/bin/*singular*
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/singular" # 3.x and 4.x
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/factory" # 3.x and 4.x
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/factor.h" # 3.x only
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/factoryconf.h" # 3.x only
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/omalloc" #4.x only
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/omalloc.h" # 3.x only
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/omlimits.h" # 3.x only
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/resources" #4.x only
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/include/gfanlib" #4.x only
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libsingular* # 3.x with lower case
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libsingcf*.a # 3.x only additional archives
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libsingfac*.a # 3.x only additional archives
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libSingular* # 4.x with upper case
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/p_Procs_Field* # 3.x only
    # a bunch of additional libraries for 4.x
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libpolys*
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libfactory*
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libomalloc*
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libresources*
    rm -r "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libgfan*
    rm -rf "$SAGE_LOCAL/share/singular"
    rm -f "$SAGE_LOCAL"/share/info/singular*
}
```
which doesn't deal with any of the Cygwin names for the library (that would be another good reason why Cygwin should just the name `libSingular` instead of `cygSingular`).

This ensures Singular will be "uninstalled" better when upgrading on Cygwin.  This way there really should only be one `SINGULAR_SO` (if any) found in the method used by this patch.

Much as it's not nice to have platform-specific checks in `sage.env` I think for something like this (that is, locating a shared library for `dlopen()`) it's inevitable. So I'd rather leave it explicit for now, and deal with it better later (e.g. in #22652).

I think I had `rm -rf` because one of the lines I replaced was `rm -r "$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libgfan*`, though I don't know why that would need `-r` either.

I agree `SINGULAR_SO = None` is fairly useless, but there should still be a better fallback in case the library is not found.  Currently this just results in an `IndexError` if so.

The `-r` would only be needed if there would be a **directory** called `libgfan...`

That seems like something which shouldn't happen and I'd rather see an error in that case.

> Currently this just results in an `IndexError` if so.

At least, it's very clear where the error happens. Setting `SINGULAR_SO = None` might just lead to more obscure errors later.

Better a more explicit error message in that "later" case then.  Or earlier, if you prefer.  My thinking was just that it might be nice to be able to import `sage.env` even if the Singular install is broken, for debugging purposes if nothing else.
