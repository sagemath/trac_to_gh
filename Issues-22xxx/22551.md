Ticket #11634 made the ppl library be the default backend for the `Polyhedron class`.

Currently, Polyhedron objects still have a `.field()` method which is ill-named and since #11634 out-dated.

This ticket deprecates this method.

Since it is in a nested function, I removed the deprecation warning.

This was intended merely to make the nomenclature about base ring consistent across the geometry component...
