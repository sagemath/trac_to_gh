Right now we can only get the Bruhat graph of Weyl groups even though we can do the same thing for Coxeter Groups. I plan on moving bruhat_graph from the WeylGroups class in combinat/root_system to the category of Coxeter groups. This will keep WeylGroup having the method, but expand it to Coxter groups.

Additionally, it would be natural to not require two elements to find a the graph between them. So instead, if the group is finite, we'll allow the calling of bruhat_graph() which will bring back the entire graph.

Some comments:

-I think the extra doctests should not be in the block below saying <code>:trac:\`17744\`</code>, but above it.
- Instead of this complicated check for the long element and you already test `self.is_finite()`, so just do the default being the long element there. This is better locality of code.
- A better error message would be `infinite groups must specify a maximal element`.
- `reflection_length` needs a doctest.
- Even though it is slight code duplication, it would be faster (and probably cleaner) to use code similar to `bruhat_interval`. While this could be done on a separate ticket, I think it would be better to do this here and now.

So all the above corrections have been made.

I didn't understand what you meant by replicating bruhat_interval in your last comment. Do you mean using a similar while loop in bruhat_group to find all potential additional chains? The issue here is that if the group is infinite we can't go through "all" the reflections to test things out. Hence why this method was used (and I kept it over from the current version). Unless you mean something different?

Actually, looking into this a bit more, I think we should have `bruhat_graph` be constructed from the transitive closure of the digraph of the Bruhat cover relations. This way we would not have to look at what is a reflection and what is not.

So what I would do is start with a hidden method `_bruhat_covers_digraph`, which builds the digraph of cover relations by using code from `bruhat_interval`. Then `bruhat_graph` would return `self._bruhat_covers_digraph(x,y).transitive_closure()`. Furthermore, `bruhat_poset` could be lifted and generalized to return `Poset(self._bruhat_covers_digraph(x,y), cover_relations=True, facade=facade)`.

I can do this is if you want me to.

Actually, the transitive closure is too permissive as you can get differences that are products of reflections, which of course, are not always reflections. However, I was able to get a massive speed boost by sorting the `bruhat_interval` by length so we only have to do approx `n^2 / 2` checks and not have to do the length checks each time.

I also added a `bruhat_interval_poset`, which goes slightly beyond the scope of the ticket but is in the spirit of it, instead of lifting up `bruhat_poset` to keep that reserved for the entire Bruhat order poset.
