ECL-20.4.24 has been released (on 2020/04/24)

https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/posts/ECL-20424-release.html

We should update, as it will resolve some Maxima bugs, and is essential for resolving other Maxima bugs.

**Tarball**: see checksums.ini [upstream_url].
(To configure Sage to download from the upstream URL, use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url`)

> Probably ECL doesn't go out of its way to reset FPE flags when ECL is exiting. So probably, after executing ECL code, it is now the case that (often?) the FPE flags are set the way ECL wants; not the way we want. So in addition to restoring the SIG handlers, we should probably sprinkle an appropriate amount of fesetenv calls around the ECL entry and exit wrappers.

this does not explain why simply setting ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE to 0 solves the issue for division by 0, but not for FP overflow.

However, I don't understand why doing anything with ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE has any effect whatsoever (assuming we do not preserve it among other ECL's interrupts such as SIGINT).
Shouldn't 

```
    #and put the Sage signal handlers back
    for i in range(1,32):
        sigaction(i, &sage_action[i], NULL)
```
in ecl.pyx be overriding whatever ECL did with SIGFPE?

I am not very familiar with this kind of coding issues and/or with SIG handling in general.

If we're doing our sig handler setting properly then it shouldn't matter what sig handlers ECL installs when we run non-ECL code, because we switch them out. As far as I can see this is the case. I see no evidence that an ECL sig handler is interfering with our work. The trace-back doesn't mention ECL code at all. Just an uncaught signal.

It seems that the sage action for SIGFPE is to coredump. That's what we're seeing.

There are flags that govern when SIGFPE is raised (rather than propagating a NaN or something similar). The ECL macro I pointed at will be inserted in ECL generated code quite a bit, so I expect that macro to be executed ALL THE TIME. Plus, the patch was made exactly to fix an issue of unraised SIGFPEs (CL apparently prefers the exceptions over NaNs by default).

We are not taking measures to set fenv to our liking after executing ECL, and one change in the new ECL version is certainly to change fenv more often. So I think it's worth a try to save & restore's sage's own fenv across ECL calls.

It could be that ECL changes its FPE raise mask depending on the value of ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE. I haven't checked. That would be consistent with observed behaviour.

But why do we get an uncaught FP overflow signal? That's because booting ECL up destroys Sages' sig handler, even if we switch ECLs SIGFPE handler off. How exactly this is possible is not clear to me.

The corresponding ECL command is `(si::trap-fpe t nil)`, so we could just pass that to ECL just after cl_boot. That might be easier/more efficient than passing it in the argv.

This should put ECL in agreement about what the fenv FPE raise flags are supposed to be (and then it also doesn't matter what SIGFPE handler ECL uses, because the signals will not occur, so we don't need to restore ECL's SIGFPE handler for ECL code either.

examples can be found on #18920. More specifically, in Sage Maxima built with ECL 16.1.3 and unpatched `libs/ecl.pyx` gives crash dumps like

```
sage: g(x)=taylor(log(x),x,1,6) # this initialises ECL/Maxima
sage: q = (2^53) * 2^971/1
sage: float(q) # boom, instead of "inf" as the answer.
...
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred.
...
```
and

```
sage: g(x)=taylor(log(x),x,1,6); g
x |--> -1/6*(x - 1)^6 + 1/5*(x - 1)^5 - 1/4*(x - 1)^4 + 1/3*(x - 1)^3 - 1/2*(x - 1)^2 + x - 1
sage: plot(log(x),(x,0,2))

it is desirable to tell ECL to NOT let floating point exceptions raise SIGFPE

I think this is an academic issue, because in our current setting, no fp exceptions will occur in the window, and hence the way SIGFPE is handled is irrelevant. Anyway:

I assume ECL installs its SIGFPE handler before it executes any FP instructions and/or sets the fenv. The ECL's SIGFPE handler greatly eases the effect of SIGFPE. So if `(si::trap-fpe T NIL)` is executed right after `cl_boot`; before switching the SIGhandlers, I think the risk is smaller (I don't think there is a risk at all because no FP work occurs in this process, so it's hard to make an accurate estimate of the relative risks here).

Alternatively, you could trust that ECL knows what it's doing and execute cl_boot with an argv that contains `--no-trap-fpe`. With any luck, that should just get processed in the same way as command line options upon startup. It is then ECL's responsibility to do this before a SIGFPE actually occurs. In reality, this is essentially the same as just feeding ECL `(si::trap-fpe T NIL)` just after boot.

fenv is supposed to be thread-specific, so concurrency issues should not come into play, even if sage were ever to grow multiple threads.

That ticket has now been closed and its fix was to change a test.

No movement on https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/347, so if updating ECL is relevant then doing so with the `(si::trap-fpe T NIL)` given here is probably a good way to go.

If I'm reading it correctly it was closed by https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/commit/2a9084b105caf26c89bb16ed4dd0bf5aa7ceab59

Beckporting that commit to 16.1.3 still doesn't fix the SIGFPE crashes on Arch unfortunately.

As the ECL developer that made this change: Did you also set the ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE option to false, i.e. put an extra line `ecl_set_option(ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE, 0);` into the ecl.pyx file before testing this? Because otherwise if you use the default value of true, you still instruct ECL to generate and catch floating point exceptions.

Yes, still no difference

Is the patch set you are working with available somewhere? I would like to try what you have done myself. May be more eyeballs can detect an issue that escaped you.

ecl 16.1.3 has been out for a while. Us in the distro world have been stumped for a bit. If you can move it, it would be very much appreciated.

Then I'm guessing, the branch at https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commits/u/nbruin/ecl16.1.3 also failed for you? Because all the patch of ‚Äãhttps://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/commit/2a9084b105caf26c89bb16ed4dd0bf5aa7ceab59 does is to call `(si::trap-fpe t nil)` during startup if the `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE` option is false.

Anyway, I think the real issue is that maxima enables floating point overflow exceptions during startup (see the last line in the src/ecl-port.lisp file of the maxima source directory). Removing this line should fix the observed crashes also with an unpatched ECL 16.1.3 and without the need to explicitely call `(si::trap-fpe t nil)` in ecl.pyx (as long as the `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE` option is false of course). This is also consistent with the observation in https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/issues/317 that floating point overflows behaved differently than the other floating point exceptions.

Of the patches we still include for our ECL build, are there any that haven't been submitted upstream, or at least that still need upstream issues?

I know that I got `flisten-bug.patch` fixed here: https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/merge_requests/51  so that patch can probably be backported to 16.1.3 if need be (and in any case, the bug it fixes was only, to my knowledge, affecting Cygwin, so I don't care about it for Linux).

The difficulty/problem here is that ECL's `si_trap_fpe` still uncondtionally (when available) calls feenableexcept.  The effect of `(si::trap-fpe t nil)` is effectively to call `feenableexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW | FE_INVALID)` which means now `SIGFPE`s will be sent to the program that weren't otherwise.

The only effect of setting `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE = 0` is that ECL's signal handler won't be installed (actually this setting could be avoided entirely by saving/restoring ECL's SIGFPE handler like we do some of its other signal handlers).

However, `(si::trap-fpe t nil)` still results now in unhandled `SIGFPE`s in random places where previously floating point exceptions were just ignored, or handled manually.

The effect of `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE = 0` in ECL 16.1.3 is a) that no signal handler for SIGFPE exceptions is installed and b) that in contrast to `ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE = 1` no floating point exceptions are enabled (i.e. feenableexcept is not called).

No, it doesn't, as explained above.

You're right: I was having trouble understanding exactly how this code works.  The problem doesn't come from `(si::trap-fpe t nil)`, but rather the fact that maxima later enables traps for overflows (which then needs to be subsequently disabled, per the patch in [comment:78](#comment:78)).

I guess, what I would want, would be an option to effectively turn `trap-fpe` into a no-op, because it's still modifying the global floating point environment in a way that's rather opaque and detrimental when embedding.

Anyways, since we identified for now the one place where this was happening--loading maxima--I'm content for now to step away, though we should probably change our `ecl_sig_on/off()` to save/restore the floating point environment and clear any floating point exceptions.

Happy New Year and have a good night!

Here's my attempt to patch this more generally.  It appears to work, but I'm not sure how robust it is.  With this, it's not necessary to manually call `si::trap-fpe` anywhere, because ECL's FPE traps are saved/restored alongside its signal handlers by `ecl_sig_on/off()`:

It seems to me that the `fedisableexcept/feenableexcept` dance is supposed to switch between "ecl" FPE state and "sage" FPE state. However, that is not what those commands do. According to the documentation, `fedisableexcept` just disables the given exceptions (and leaves the other ones the way they were) and `feenableexcept` enables them. Furthermore, it seems these are supposedly glibc extensions.

When I look at the relevant manpage, it seems to indicate that `fegetenv` and `fesetenv` are defined in C99 and do set the FPE environment wholesale. So, would it be better to do:

```
fegetenv(&sage_fe_env)

OK, I don't know enough about IEEE floats. Someone else with more expertise should take a look at this.

The fact that only part of the FP state gets swapped (which exceptions get trapped) and another part (exception state flags) does not, looks suspicious.

I would normally think that a little more rigorous argument than "it doesn't seem to cause problems right now" would be warranted before implementing such a shortcut in an interface.

I had a patch for that in my original commit. Did it get lost during the rebase?

The error is due to maxima's copy of defsystem using a long obsolete package nickname which has been removed in ECL 20.4.24 and still needs to be reported on the maxima bugtracker.

I just took the diff against 9.0 and patched 9.1 with it.
In the process I had to rename spkg-install to spkg-install.in, but otherwise
everything else just applied without any problems. So it most probably was never in your branch.

the latter has been reported and fixed by Maxima, as I just found.

On Debian testing running on core i7 + 16 GB RAM using the system packages recommended by `README.md}}, {{{ptestlong` on the present branch raises the same failures already [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/3mj1UjWf31g/uE7GqdfmAQAJ) for 5.2.beta0 on the same machine.

These failures are similar to those reported for [9.1.rc3](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/4spsDgdYoYA/O1ZjI5VLBgAJ) and explained away by [Jonathan Kliem](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/4spsDgdYoYA/CS8T3x4gBwAJ).

Re-running the failed/timed out doctests show that the timed out one pass and all others persist to fail ; see attached `chkerrs-22191.txt`.

This branch results do not seem to differ from thos of 9.2.beta0 as far as ECL might be concerned.

==> (tentative) `positive_review`. As in other cases, a check on a system using Sage packages (i. e. one on whichg `ptestlong` raises no failures) would be useful.

To make it accessible to more users, how about using `./configure --enable-manual=no`? Or use this if the version of `makeinfo` is too old?

The system version of makeinfo on OS X:

```
% makeinfo --version                     
makeinfo (GNU texinfo) 4.8

However, on Cygwin (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/765619947), I am getting:

Being solo for most (but not all) of the last 12 years has not been without its ups and downs. I could even use the word burnout for a few periods. On top of that, I don't have an academic style position and I don't have all the time I would like. I am currently a one man eResearch department (doing solo must be my things - kidding we were almost ready to get me a collaborator when a change at the top lead to cancelling all ongoing hiring processes, even for stuff like me that have a truck factor of one). I currently have to deal with stuff like strategic planning, data management, cloud provisioning, HPCCF, carpentries... I sometimes call myself an undertaker. I do all the stuff other people don't want to do. There is a moment where you learn the word "no".

So, thank you very much but I would very much prefer a helper.

I mean the 'public/ticket-22191' branch that was attached to this ticket previously. To sum up:

with the current 'public/packages/ecl20' tests segfault if ecl is built with threads, work fine if ecl is built without threads

with the 'public/ticket-22191' plus the ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGCHLD-removal part of this patch, there are no segfaults with ecl built with threads.

this branch was for ECL 16.1.3, thus it is not clear to me which multithreadef ECL  you tested.

In any case I hope gh-spaghettisalad knows what is going on, I bet it has to do with fork() called by the doctesting framework.

this can be rewritten as follows,

```
sage: L = [(i/100.0, maxima_calculus.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i))
....:         for i in range(-300,300)]
```
avoiding pexpect, I think. Indeed, it's 5 times faster:

```
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima_calculus.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 110 ms per loop
sage: timeit("L = [(i/100.0, maxima.eval('jacobi_sn (%s/100.0,2.0)'%i)) for i in range(-300,300)]")
5 loops, best of 3: 556 ms per loop
```

Sorry for the late reply, I've been busy. I agree that a bugfix release is needed. This will probably still take a bit though, I want to take a look at some other bugs first (https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/594 and https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/-/issues/586) and then there's still tests to run.
