Here are a few things I've noticed so far.

- Need to have in the longer description that this is using the 'relative multiplicative height'

- remove todo block  (QQ and r=0 are covered in other functions)

- step 13: spelling: thier


- why switching to iter instead of yield? What about the issues of this being possibly *many* points? Please respond.

- LLL reduction still in docs for elements_of_bounded_height.


- need spaces between inputs lines in elements_of_bounded_height

- spaces after , in parameters

- This fails:

```
R.<x>=QQ[]
K.<a> = NumberField(x^3 - x^2 + 1)
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
list(A.points_of_bounded_height(2))
```
then so does subschemes

```
A.<x,y>=AffineSpace(K,2)
C = A.subscheme([x-y])
C.rational_points(2)
```

- reference should be updated with published version

- add yourself and TJ Combs to author section at top of file

Sorry, I just realized I never commented on this. The fix does work, but I would change one thing.

d_tilde is used in a couple other places, so I would covert d_tilde to RR in the same place M is converted (after calculations with it are done)

d_tilde = RR(d_tilde)

no, I did get notified and even pulled it down and tested, but apparently I never put in my comments.

In going back over my tests with the new branch, there is one addition thing that I had noticed that needs to be fixed. With affine schemes working it exposed the fact that the height is converted to an absolute height incorrectly. In affine_space.py it has

```
bound = bound**(1/self.base_ring().absolute_degree())
```
which should be

```
bound = bound**self.base_ring().absolute_degree()
```

You may need to adjust an example. If not, you should definitely add one that ensures this bound is converted correctly.

Changing the height bound is not quite what I meant. It sounds like this is an instance of getting the points in L' which are supposed to be within tolerance of the height

abs(H_k(x) - B) < tolerance

If you need to move the bound to 50.1, then these points are outside of the specified tolerance when bound=50. Since we have to do some conversion between relative and absolute heights. Perhaps the issue is that tolerance must also undergo a similar 'conversion'?

The point I'm making is that we shouldn't be seeing if we can adjust the parameters to gt the 'right' answer, but rather see which is the right answer for the parameters in the doctest.

The difference are the eight points which all have height

50.0163488242872

so, if the tolerance is specified as 0.01 with a bound of 50, then these points should not be returned. In other words, that would be a failure in the tolerance.

Actually, it looks like the number_field.py function has default tolerance 0.2, which makes the new output correct, however, the other function (bdd_height) has default tolerance 0.01.  I would say maybe to make the default tolerance in all of these functions the same (perhaps the 0.01).

Yes sir, I got your point, but before changing there is one issue.

What should be the ideal value of tolerance, in earlier testing 0.01 was good enough, but as in this example height can be very close to tolerance (0.01634..). My suggestion is still to use 0.01, what are your views on that?

I'm ok with the vague description of lowering tolerance, except that I would not just say extra, but rather points larger than the specified bound.

However, there are still a number of documentation issues surrounding tolerance that I had missed earlier.

- bdd_height still claims that all points satisfy |H(P) - B| < tol. Which is what I am finding to be not accurate.

- elements_of_bounded_height still lists the old warning

- there is no way to specify tolerance or precision in the places affine objects call enum_number_field

- there is no way specify tolerance in the places projective objects call enum_number_field

- The statements about what algorithm is used etc, should be also be in the indirect call places as well. (these are actually more likely to be used by the user).

Here is a suggestion for updating the docs. Please look over for typos.

Also there are still a couple functionality things:
kwds needed so tolerance, precision can be specified if needed

- affine homeset needs *kwds 

- product projective needs *kwds

- projective homset needs *kwds

need to remember to run doctests before pushing...

```
sage -t --warn-long 63.5 product_projective/homset.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --warn-long 63.5 product_projective/space.py  # 2 doctests failed
```
