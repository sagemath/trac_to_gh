Try the following:

```
arrow((2,2),(3,5),arrowsize=8,head=2,width=1,linestyle='dashdot',zorder=10)
```
Although the `head` option is set to 2, it does not produce two arrowheads, only one on the opposite side. It seems to be a problem when combining this option with `dashdot`, since it works fine with solid lifestyle.

Component: **graphics**
