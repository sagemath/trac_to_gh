Apple has changed the .DS_Store file format and now the background image of the Mac installer (see ticket #20119) disappeared.

I am working on a change that uses AppleScript to set the background image.

It is, so to speak, strictly better than how I previously was generating the .DS_Store. The downside, however, is that building the .app.dmg takes a minute or so longer and there is an intermediate file of several Gb around.

I should say though that I have only tested this on Sierra so far.

But to backup my claim: it seems that AppleScript has supported setting the position of icons and the background image since ancient times. It also seems that there was a change to the .DS_Store format (concerning the background image) several Mac OS X versions back and a transition period over several years, Sierra finally phased out the old format.
