The failure occurs because `graphviz_string` does not allow edges to be given as lists (exposed by #18545).

Actually, this even works:

```
sage: F_internal = [tuple(c) for c in F.cover_relations() if c in L.cover_relations()]
```
Which makes sense considering the assertion is checking `assert isinstance(edge, tuple)`. What I suggest is making it also allow `list`.
