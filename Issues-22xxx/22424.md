According to [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36705/to_directed-affects-original-graph/), we have a very bizarre behavior for certain graphs:

```
G1=graphs.RandomGNP(5,0.5)
G1.plot(save_pos=True)
G2=G1.to_directed()
G2.delete_vertex(0)
G2.add_vertex(5)
G2.plot()
G1.plot()
```
gives

```
    485                 self._plot_components['vertex_labels'].append(text(str(v),
--> 486                     self._pos[v], rgbcolor=(0,0,0), zorder=8))

KeyError: 0
```
As if the zero vertex had been removed from `G1`.  Plotting only one of them does NOT cause the error, and doing anything else seems fine.  Reversing the order of the plotting gives `KeyError: 5` as if the 5 vertex had never been added - in both cases it is the *second* plot which gives fits.

See comments below.

<a id='comment:1'></a>In the `to_directed`method, we have:

```
        D = DiGraph(name           = self.name(),
                    pos            = self._pos,
                    multiedges     = self.allows_multiple_edges(),
                    loops          = self.allows_loops(),
                    implementation = implementation,
                    data_structure = (data_structure if data_structure!="static_sparse"
                                      else "sparse")) # we need a mutable copy
```
Hence, the dictionary `_pos` storing the positions of the vertices is the same.

This patch solves this issue passing a copy of the position dictionary.
