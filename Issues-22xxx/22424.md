```
According to [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/36705/to_directed-affects-original-graph/), we have a very bizarre behavior for certain graphs:

```
G1=graphs.RandomGNP(5,0.5)
G1.plot(save_pos=True)
G2=G1.to_directed()
G2.delete_vertex(0)
G2.add_vertex(5)
G2.plot()
G1.plot()
```
gives

```
    485                 self._plot_components['vertex_labels'].append(text(str(v),
--> 486                     self._pos[v], rgbcolor=(0,0,0), zorder=8))

KeyError: 0
```
As if the zero vertex had been removed from `G1`.  Plotting only one of them does NOT cause the error, and doing anything else seems fine.  Reversing the order of the plotting gives `KeyError: 5` as if the 5 vertex had never been added - in both cases it is the *second* plot which gives fits.

See comments below.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

In the `to_directed`method, we have:

```
        D = DiGraph(name           = self.name(),
                    pos            = self._pos,
                    multiedges     = self.allows_multiple_edges(),
                    loops          = self.allows_loops(),
                    implementation = implementation,
                    data_structure = (data_structure if data_structure!="static_sparse"
                                      else "sparse")) # we need a mutable copy
```
Hence, the dictionary `_pos` storing the positions of the vertices is the same.

This patch solves this issue passing a copy of the position dictionary.

Nice quick find.  This makes perfect sense - and I see why it didn't show up before!    Thanks.

You'll want to add some sort of doctest to verify that this is fixed.

The problem reported in this patch is reproducible as:

```
sage: G1=graphs.Grid2RandomGNP(5,0.5)
sage: gp1 = G1.graphplot(save_pos=True)
sage: G2=G1.to_directed()
sage: G2.delete_vertex(0)
sage: G2.add_vertex(5)
sage: gp2 = G2.graphplot()
sage: gp1 = G1.graphplot()
```
So I added this test to the ticket rather than a `show` or `plot` call.
