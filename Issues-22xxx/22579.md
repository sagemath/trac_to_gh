Many computational systems are nowadays available as jupyter kernels.
We should interface to them using [jupyter_client](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/client.html).
This would be more robust than pexpect.

Do you have a concrete kernel in mind? I'm wondering if there are any kernels where this approach makes more sense than other approaches (like `pexpect` or directly interfacing the libary).

This topic came up here at days84 related to polymake (#22452), however I see very wide applicability.

Obviously, directly interfacing a library is almost always better -- except if one wants to be able to access a remote server.

But a pexpect interface seems to be much easier to write -- except for tricky/brittle things such as tab completion and signal handling.

With a jupyter kernel all these tricky things are already implemented. So there would be a separation of concerns, which we can benefit from. 

Moreover, since there is a clear over-the-wire protocol, rather than having to send everything through a pty, this will be more robust.

If nobody can come up with a concrete proposal here, I'd rather close this as "wontfix". It's a cute idea but I don't really see the point.
