it's strange that creating fplll with clang works fine, while making a cython extension fails. It might well be a cython bug.
So the 1st step towards debugging this might be to try to trigger this without cython.

Cython only creates a `.cpp` file. This seems like a linking issue, which Cython has nothing to do with.

it is perfectly possible to create a `.cpp` file that will produce a linking failure.
Given that fplll passes all of its own checks, it seems a bit strange that fpylll fails here.

By the way, I wonder what precisely are options passed to clang that lead to this. 

* Does it get `-std=c++11`? 
* Does it get `-stdlib=libc++`?

There may be something to look there. `fplll` is compiled with `-std=c++11` but not `fpylll`. For the second, well it is a recent OS X so implicitly we are using `--stdlib=libc++` since this is the default one - I would have to point to the gnu one for it to be used.

if I try using non-sage python; I first got that `build/temp.macosx-10.4` and weird C++ errors, and then this after I added explicit

So this is some sort of p/cython misconfiguration related to (lack of) c++ support we have seen a lot already.

this is what this mangled symbol stands for:

```
$ c++filt -n _ZN5fplll14EnumerationDynINS_5FP_NRIA1_10dpe_structEEE16process_solutionEd
fplll::EnumerationDyn<fplll::FP_NR<dpe_struct [1]> >::process_solution(double)
```
however `enumeration.so` only has

```
typeinfo for fplll::EnumerationDyn<fplll::FP_NR<dpe_struct [1]> >
  and
typeinfo name for fplll::EnumerationDyn<fplll::FP_NR<dpe_struct [1]> >
```
(I extracted the latter running `nm -gU` on that .so file.)
In comparison, `enumeration.so` built with `gcc`, also has

```
fplll::EnumerationDyn<fplll::FP_NR<dpe_struct [1]> >::~EnumerationDyn()
```

I have no idea why this happens.

---

moreover, the same kind of difference can be traced by to `fplll.dynlib`, where the one built with gcc does have
explicit `process_solution` entries, e.g.

```
fplll::EnumerationDyn<fplll::FP_NR<dpe_struct [1]> >::process_solution(double)
```
but the one built with clang does not. So perhaps the problem is already in `fplll.dynlib`, it's just not tested properly.

The `-g` option of `nm` only show global symbols. The faulty one is "local", you will find it in the clang version if you don't pass any option to `nm`. What type of symbol is it according to `nm` for gcc on OS X for you?

On linux it is of type "W", according to the man page:

The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.

In fact, `clang` is totally correct there - private class members must not be exposed.

It seems that the design only works on `gcc` due to a bug there :-)

Also, it appears that `fplll` does not supply any tests for this "enumeration" functionality. I'm trying to write one now, so that it can be seen purely on C++ level.
