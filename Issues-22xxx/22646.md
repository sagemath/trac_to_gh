Standard autotools packages allow variables such as CC to be set at configure time using

```
./configure CC=/path/to/gcc
```
In this ticket, we add support for this. (The syntax already works, but the settings right now only end up in the unused file `build/make/Makefile-auto`.)

Would that need to over-ride `sage-env` if sage's gcc has been installed? Useful for mad scientist experiments but probably not for common users.

Yes, all of CC, CXX, FC, etc.
As a guideline, one can look into the list of variables that appear in an automake-generated Makefile.

In my opinion, if the user provides a specific CC, CXX in this way and configure finds out that they are not suitable, that should be an error.

A gcc package should only be installed if no CC, CXX were provided in this way by the user. 
Only in that case, `sage-env` should do its special magic to set these variables to have the sage gcc used.

This is a first draft for this. I am dropping the setting for `CPP`. If there are packages, not using autotools, that need it to be set, I'll reconsider.

The thing that I particularly don't like is 

```
if [ -x "$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/cpp" ]; then
    CPP=cpp

```
in `sage-env`. Without it package using autoconf should naturally use `gcc -E`, but because of this, when you install sage's gcc you get `cpp`.

Pretty much.

```
should work too. Actually it would work without this ticket. But without this ticket once sage is built your settings for CC/CXX/FC is forgotten. You may want to read #21701 on the potential consequences of that amnesia.

Either provide the matching gfortran or uses #12426 which is build on top of this ticket and decouples gfortran (because clang).

sometimes `gcc` can be called to compile fortran, e.g. something like `gcc6 -x f95` might be able to compile fortran.

I am trying

```
 ./configure CC=clang CXX=clang++
```
on Fedora 23 (clang 3.7) with SAGE_INSTALL_GCC=no
and I still see it doing some `g++` tests:

```
...
checking for complex.h... yes
checking whether clang++ supports C++11 features by default... no
checking whether clang++ supports C++11 features with -std=gnu++11... yes
checking for clang option to accept ISO C99... none needed
checking for Fortran flag needed to accept free-form source... -ffree-form
checking if gcc accepts -dumpversion option... yes
checking gcc version... 4.2.1
checking if g++ accepts -dumpversion option... yes
checking g++ version... 4.2.1
checking for sqrt in -lm... yes
...
```
And I don't even get how it gets `4.2.1` there, as gcc/g++/gfortran installed is 5.3.1.
Is it "gcc emulation mode"?!

I don't know how your clang 3.7 is built, it may also be using g++ libstdc++ in which case the version of g++ is important for c++11 support. Which version of gcc/g++ is this?

Shouldn't Sage ./configure check for C++11 support with`-std=c++11`?
Currently it checks for C++11 support `-std=gnu++11`; e.g. on FreeBSD I see

```
checking whether clang++-devel supports C++11 features with -std=gnu++11... yes

The patch is difficult to apply considering there is no `AC_PROG_CPP` in gf2x-1.1, I think you missed thome's first commit adding it and you are only quoting the one moving it. I don't think the move matters too much by the way.

At present even with CPP and CXXCPP properly set, I still need 
`GF2X_CONFIGURE="--disable-hardware-specific-code $GF2X_CONFIGURE"` - otherwise I get non-sensical errors at tune stage, saying something along the lines of "this code can only be run on a 64-bit system" (see #22679, the last commit)

I was not able to figure out what goes wrong. Perhaps it's indeed this change that is needed to get the toolchain right, any idea?

Let's not bother with that. We could do a survey on whether or not people are using this "feature", that is purely accidental, on sage-devel. We have enough people that we would get a few yeses, even if it is just for the principle of the thing.

Driving changes through people's throat is usually not a good idea. The best ways are

Still, for consistency, it makes more sense if an environment variable would override the compiler in all cases. So, the compiler should be determined by the following in decreasing order of priority:

1. Environment variables

2. Sage-installed GCC

3. `./configure` setting

I think that this logic

```
# On OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later when building GCC, use clang as
# default C compiler as some older versions of XCode 4 ship broken
# versions of GCC which fail to bootstrap GCC-4.6.3.
# See http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12820
if [ "$SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN" = yes ] && [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ] && [ "$MACOSX_VERSION" -ge 11 ; then
    CC=`which clang 2>/dev/null`
    CXX=`which clang++ 2>/dev/null`
```
should also be moved to `configure`.

Unfortunately, autoconf 2.69 (which is still the latest release despite being 5 years old) does not support `clang`.

So I suggest something along the lines of

```
if test -z "$CC"; then
    if test -n "$MACOSX_VERSION" && test "$MACOSX_VERSION" -ge 11 ; then
        AC_CHECK_TOOL(CC, clang)
    fi
fi
AC_PROG_CC()
```

Given that people with hardware for 10.6 can probably upgrade to 10.7, this might seem reasonable.

I just checked that one can still get official OSX 10.6 just as well...
(but no 10.5).
10.6 has a feature missing in 10.7, it can run PPC applications.
Other than that, I don't see why people would want to stick with it.

Two comments:

1) Strong objection to mixing an autoconf feature with sage-specific behavior (environment CC overrides configured CC), which makes it different from any other autoconf-based package. It is an important feature that the configured variables stick in the build and that this works even in the presence of some polluted environment.

If it is really necessary to make overriding possible using environment settings, you can invent new variables such as `SAGE_OVERRIDE_CC` etc.

2) I would suggest to only set variables in `sage-env-config` and keep all logic (if-then) in `sage-env`. For example:

```
SAGE_CONFIGURED_CC="@CC@"
```

I don't consider Sage to be a "package" (it's a distribution of packages), so I don't see it as an issue that it behaves differently from other packages. It's comparing an apple with oranges. It has always been the case in Sage that a `CC` environment variable overrides the default `CC` and nobody has ever considered this a problem.

In that case, we should simply support `make CC=...` from the top-level. But that will require some additional work.

You don't say what exactly you tried.
My point is that you *can* override by using makefile variables like this:

```
   make CC=xyzzy
```
but you *cannot* override using environment variables:

```
  CC=xyzzy make
```

Any implementation for Sage should copy this behavior.

Replying to [fbissey](#comment%3A90):
> As the requester on this ticket I wish you had expressed yourself earlier on that particular design. It is a fine idea to confine `sage-env-config` to be a variable store without any logic in it. I just wish I had that requirement earlier. I had the first draft of the current design up 2 months ago and really opened to criticism 7 weeks ago.


Right, and I wish I had more time for Sage development lately. In any case, this one is just a suggestion. If #21707 is still something that we want to do, we can change the structure of these scripts at that time.

I guess we are all there in regards to time [in fact I started writting this answer more than 24 hours ago now...]. I was just venting.

I have no vested interest in #21707. If anything I think this is misguided at this point. I think some other work like the decoupling of "sagelib" from the packaging system should be done first and would be beneficial to some of what you seek in #21707 in the long run (personal opinion).

I will turn `sage-env-config` in a variable store in this ticket. It is not going to be included but could be material early in the 8.1 cycle.

On that note I will leave the current behavior for over-riding `CC`. I don't want to be part of that debate more than is necessary. Feel free to open a ticket to get the behavior you want, but I think you need to get traction from sage-devel first, since there is opposition.

It would be nice to get this merged soon, so it is early in the 8.1 release cycle. What are the obstacles to this?

Possibly bikering over what behavior it should enforce. Currently `CC=.. ./sage -f ...` or `CC=... make ....` will over-ride the configure time compiler. Some people think it shouldn't, only `make ... CC=...` should.

I certainly have been there and wanted that, my point is that having `CC=...` as a parameter to a script (rather than an environment variable) is akin to having two girlfriends with the same given name---sometimes convenient, but sometimes making you dazed and confused... ;-)

I don't see what you mean here. E.g. in `configure.ac` one can probably do something like

```
CCORIG=gcc
AC_SUBST(CC,$CCORIG)
AC_ARG_WITH(cc,AS_HELP_STRING(--with-cc=...,specify the full path to the C compiler ($CC)),CC=$withval)
AC_PROG_CC()
...
AC_ARG_WITH(cxx,...
```
to create `./configure` arguments such as `--with-cc=`, and set `CC`, etc to the right values.

You choose to see it as a parameter because it is put at the end of the line. But really it is just setting that environment variable while running that command. You could put it in front with the same result, the main point of putting it in a "parameter" position is that it is captured in `config.log`. But whether it is passed as, a parameter, a single shot environment variable or exported from the environment, it all give the same result.

There is no duality, it is always an environment variable. And setting it on that command line, either in front, or in parameter position, is all about not polluting your main environment with the setting in question.

But my feeling is that this is beside the point of this ticket.

... and `config.status`, of course, so that the setting persists across `config.status --recheck` etc. 


For positive review, I would like to see:
-  the difference in behavior to standard autotools (comment 92) documented somewhere
-  a follow-up ticket for making the behavior equal  to standard autotools should be created
-  the ticket summary should be updated (support "for all `SAGE_...` variables" is not implemented in the branch) - follow-up ticket?

Actually, while I may add a bit of documentation on configuration, the current documentation is quite explicit about how `CC` and others is used

```
- :envvar:`CC` - while some programs allow you to use this to specify your C
  compiler, **not every Sage package recognizes this**.
  If GCC is installed within Sage, :envvar:`CC` is ignored and Sage's ``gcc``
  is used instead.
```
When you have to use a variable in postfix position it is not treated as an environment variable. I may add anote that this differs from the behavior you expect from autotools.

Also, change "over-riden" to "over-ridden" and change "sage" to "Sage" (twice).

Otherwise, I don't have anything to add to it; I think it's fine.

> For #12426. It would be nice to have it in 8.1 but some people may feel the shift warrants it to go first thing in 8.2.beta0. We could take the debate to sage-devel. Things needed in my opinion for #12426:
> * new release of eclib - that won't solve all the problems but working with clang lead to improvement of the code.


eclib already took advantage of clang, it helped finding a couple of ugly memory leaks... I think it can be done after this ticket - working without a properly supported toolchain is tricky.


> * update and fix ccache


Why is this so urgent, and again, such things are harder to fix 
without a properly supported toolchain.

> * a good discussion about the giac test


What is this about? giac certainly would benefit from more uniform following c++11 or/and gnu++11...

* How about clang on Linux? Are we aiming at it now here? Or, again, this could wait for another ticket? (I'd rather do the latter; it's after all not that urgent).

`ccache` is not urgent. While it is not a blocker we should aim at supporting a maximum of optional packages out of the box. So fixing the known problems make sense.

More urgent is doing all that is possible for standard packages that have a testsuite to pass it with clang. This won't happen at this stage for `eclib` and `giac`. `eclib` because it is hard, `giac` because there is currently a test that orders results differently depending on the compiler used :( - we would need a patching option in spkg-check to fix this kind of case and it would need a little extra infrastructure.

clang on linux is just a nice side effect :) and the last ticket for it to work once #12426 is merged is in.

Note that #12426 makes it possible to use `icc` and it works, at say ~95%, out of the box for standard sage. sqlite needs a fix that belongs upstream and pari optimisation needs to be tuned down on top of my head.
