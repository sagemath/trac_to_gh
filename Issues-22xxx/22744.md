Here is a small example:

```
sage: b = Polyomino([(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2), (0,3), (1,3)])      
sage: p = Polyomino([(0,0), (1,0)])                                                
sage: T = TilingSolver([p], box=b, reusable=True)                                                                                             
sage: next(T.solve()) 
[Polyomino: [(0, 0), (1, 0)], Color: gray,               
 Polyomino: [(0, 3), (1, 3)], Color: gray,               
 Polyomino: [(1, 1), (2, 1)], Color: gray,             
 Polyomino: [(1, 2), (2, 2)], Color: gray]              
```

Before, the code allowed only to tile a d-dimensional rectangular box.

Quick comments:

- I don't understand the change in class names. Plus, I would expect `RectanglePolyomino` to be a subclass of `Polyomino`. Could you explain why you need this class hierarchy?
- Since these are subclasses of `SageObject`, you should use `_repr_`.
- When you show the one solution, those should still be marked as `# long time`, which will have valid output when run as a test.

As of now, I wrote:

```
class Polyomino_generic(SageObject):
class Polyomino(Polyomino_generic):
class RectanglePolyomino(Polyomino_generic):
```

> Could you explain why you need this class hierarchy?

Good question. I thought there was one when I started to split the classes. I just double checked, and there is no reason. We need to enumerate all the elements of a rectangle polyomino anyway, so there is no reason to store it in a more efficient way. Thank you very much for this comment!

> - Since these are subclasses of `SageObject`, you should use `_repr_`.

OK.

> - When you show the one solution, those should still be marked as `# long time`, which will have valid output when run as a test.

There was some other place where show was tested. I will change them to long time.
