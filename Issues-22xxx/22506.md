There is a tutorial on how to get tikz code to draw polytopes available [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/polytope_tikz.html).

When it was written, it was not possible to include pictures in the documentation. This ticket adds the pictures that belong to the tutorial.

Depends on #20343

It seems that this is not yet possible to include tikz code inside the documentation using the `sphinx_plot` method.

I sent an email to sage-devel [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JgS1wnNFI9g) to get some information on this topic.

I did some tests and it seems that if sage could take a `LatexExpr` and output a .png of .svg in a similar way as a plot, then since sphinx_plot eats a .png... that could be a simple hack..

SÃ©bas, didn't you do something related to this recently?

In the package slabbe.spkg (see [here](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe)), the TikzPicture class does almost all the work needed. The step missing would be to have a .plot() method returning a Sage Graphics object and then sphinx_plot could take that.
