There is a tutorial on how to get tikz code to draw polytopes available [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/polytope_tikz.html).

When it was written, it was not possible to include pictures in the documentation. This ticket adds the pictures that belong to the tutorial.

It seems that this is not yet possible to include tikz code inside the documentation using the `sphinx_plot` method.

I sent an email to sage-devel [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/JgS1wnNFI9g) to get some information on this topic.

SÃ©bas, didn't you do something related to this recently?

In the package slabbe.spkg (see [here](https://github.com/seblabbe/slabbe)), the TikzPicture class does almost all the work needed. The step missing would be to have a .plot() method returning a Sage Graphics object and then sphinx_plot could take that.
