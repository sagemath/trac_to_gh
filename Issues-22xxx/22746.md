This updates the `Dokchitser` class to share a single `gp` interpreter instance for all instances of the `Dokchitser` class.  Previously each instance spun up its own `gp` interpreter, and would keep it running until the instance is garbage-collected.

That situation was less than ideal in general, and even worse on platforms where file descriptors are limited (which could be any depending on the user's ulimits).  See #22718

This provides a temporary workaround to something like #15809, which might be a preferable solution.  But this solution was quick to hack together, works now, is needed for Cygwin, and will be easy enough to excise once a better solution is available.  Please read the commit message for more implementation details.

(please set the correct component if not "elliptic curves"--it just seemed the most relevant out of what was available)
