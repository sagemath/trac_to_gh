    RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply

```

More specifically, the warning is emitted by the call

```
sage: x=polygen(RR)
sage: numpy.float32('1.5') * x
```
seen on freeBSD+clang, OS X+clang and linux+clang. 

Similarly, the warning is emitted in

```
sage: numpy.float64(5)>e
```
or `>=` instead of `>`, or `pi` instead of `e`. Note that `pi.n()` and `e.n()` are of type `RR`, so again it points at the direction on `mpfr`.

Both polynomial_real_mpfr_dense.pyx and coerce.py are the same test - more or less

```
        sage: import numpy

        sage: numpy.float32('1.5') * x

As I suspected, both warning ultimately originate from inside `numpy`. The `multiply` warning comes from `numpy/core/tests/test_datetime.py`??? And `greater_equal` from `numpy/lib/tests/test_nanfunctions.py`, comparison with NaN.

I tried to compare the build logs for numpy (on OS X) using `gcc` vs. `clang`. I found a few errors or warnings in the clang build that are not present in the gcc build. For example:

There are quite a few warnings in the clang build related to comparisons.

By the way, the page https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/macosx.html says that we should use

```
export FFLAGS=-ff2c
```
along with the remark 'The Fortran flag “-ff2c” has been reported to be necessary.' We do not do this. Is there any reason to believe that this would help?

If we were using g77 for sure it would be necessary. The page itself is dated in my opinion. I'll dig a bit around the compilation warnings, there may be over-optimisation somewhere.

these are very uninformative (it's just a message that comes from the depths of a compiled part of numpy, not causing any interrupts). For instance:

It's also pretty hard to extract anything useful at the Sage prompt, I tried to set up a numpy interrupt following [numpy docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.seterrcall.html#numpy.seterrcall), but it ends up telling me that the interrupt happends at the top level of ipython.

Could you run numpy tests on clang/OSX? I did so on clang/FreeBSD, with some failures in complex arithmetic/functions (mostly numerical noise, but not only)
More precisely:
- untar the numpy tarball in `upstream/`
- launch `sage -sh`
- install nose (`pip install nose`)
- `cd upstream/numpy-1.11.1/numpy/testing`
- run `./setup.py install`
- `cd ../core/tests`
- run `python test*.py`

On FreeBSD I get

```
Ran 3072 tests in 53.164s
FAILED (KNOWNFAIL=6, SKIP=4, failures=22)
```

Perhaps we should upgrade to 1.12.1 and see if this helps.

by the way, `__mul__` is changing in 1.12. On 1.11 I get

`cm.explain()` answers what the coercion model would do if asked to perform this multiplication. It doesn't answer what *Python* does when asked to perform this multiplication.

- Do you mean that `x*numpy.float32('1.5')` does not use coersion, either? (Otherwise intentionally breaking the code path printed by `coercion_model.explain()` would make a difference---but it does not)

No, that would immediately use the coercion model. If you think that there is a bug with `coercion_model.explain()` please open a new self-contained bug.

I think that the multiplication in question is done entirely in numpy. (Yes, numpy does have its own polynomial class). 

```
sage: import numpy as np
sage: v=np.float32('1.5')
sage: x=polygen(RealField())
sage: np.multiply(v,x)
/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply
  #!/usr/bin/env python
1.50000000000000*x
sage: np.multiply(x,v)

  #!/usr/bin/env python
1.50000000000000*x
```
I have no idea whether `RR['x']` was designed to be compatible with numpy's polynomials, or this is a coincidence.
More computations:

```
sage: np.multiply(x^3,x-x^2)
-x^5 + x^4
sage: np.multiply(v+v*x^3,x-x^2)
/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply
  #!/usr/bin/env python
/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in add
  #!/usr/bin/env python
-1.50000000000000*x^5 + 1.50000000000000*x^4 - 1.50000000000000*x^2 + 1.50000000000000*x
sage: np.multiply(v,v)
2.25
```
this is all for clang/FreeBSD (on Linux with gcc, all of the above passes without warnings).

Wrong. Let me explain what happens:

1. Python calls `type(numpy.float32('1.5')).__mul__(numpy.float32('1.5'), x)`.

2. Numpy tries to do this multiplication but realizes that it cannot, so it returns `NotImplemented`.

3. Python calls `type(x).__mul__(..., ...)` which involves the coercion model.

4. The coercion model knows how to handle this.

So the difference between GCC and Clang almost certainly lies in step 2 above.

Hmm, I was not entirely right. The correct sequence looks like:

1. Python calls `type(numpy.float32('1.5')).__mul__(numpy.float32('1.5'), x)`.

2. Numpy tries to do this multiplication but realizes that it cannot.

3. Numpy "coerces" `numpy.float32(1.5)` to `float(1.5)` (a Python float) and calls `float(1.5) * x` instead.

4. Python realizes that it cannot do this multiplication.

5. Python calls `type(x).__mul__(1.5, x)` which is handled by the coercion model.

Still, the difference must be in step 2.

this theory does not work, as step 2 has nothing to do with `type(x)`---but `type(x)` matters, as can be seen here:

```
sage: type(x)

sage: type(numpy.float32('1.5')).__mul__(numpy.float32('1.5'), x)

1.5*x
sage: x=polygen(RR)

in this case the type has `__mul__` 

```
sage: import numpy
sage: v=numpy.float32('1.5')
sage: t=type(v)
sage: t.__mul__?
Type:           wrapper_descriptor
String form:    <slot wrapper '__mul__' of 'numpy.generic' objects>
File:           
Docstring:      x.__mul__(y) <==> x*y
...
sage: t.__mul__(v,2)
3.0
```
of course, in this case this is the same as `v*2`, just some levels down the code path.

One can unwind it a bit more:

```
sage: v.__mul__
<method-wrapper '__mul__' of numpy.float32 object at 0x7f4ad5773318>
sage: v.__mul__(2)
3.0
sage: v.__mul__(polygen(RR))
/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply
  #!/usr/bin/env python
1.50000000000000*x
```

by the way, the same warning with `__add__` and `__sub__`.

it's less clear this way whether or how Sage's coersion is involved. 

```
numpy.float32('1.5').__mul__(polygen(RR))

also does not call type explicitly, and is closer to the end of the codepath of this computation.

Sorry, as Dima said, `type(A).__mul__(A, B)` is just a contrived way of writing `A.__mul__(B)`. I wrote it with `type()` because that's closer to what Python internally actually does.

Note that `A.__mul__(B)` is *not* the same as `A * B`: essentially `A * B` first calls `A.__mul__(B)`. When this returns `NotImplemented`, Python tries the reversed multiplication.

Yes we could make a ticket numpy-1.12.1, we could drop at least one patch and I don't expect anything else to break. 

The discussion on the numpy tracker goes in the direction I suspected it would. numpy is issuing the warning because of something happening in sage. I had arrived at that conclusion by recompiling numpy (1.12.1 at the time) with gcc on a full clang install on OS X. And the problem didn't go away, implying something sage-side is happening when compiled with clang.

Leads me to two observation. I accidentally rebuilt mpfr with gcc on my linux box (`MPFR_CONFIGURE="--enable-logging" ./sage -f mpfr`) and ran all the test successfully. So `mpfr+clang` seems to be the real cause of the trouble.
Once I remembered that on my linux machine I had to set `CC` and `CXX` I encountered another problem trying to compile with logging:

```
libtool: compile:  clang -DMPFR_USE_LOGGING=1 -DTIME_WITH_SYS_TIME=1 -DHAVE_INTTYPES_H=1 -DHAVE_STDINT_H=1 -DHAVE_LOCALE_H=1 -DHAVE_WCHAR_H=1 -DHAVE_STDARG=1 -DHAVE_SYS_TIME_H=1 -DHAVE_STRUCT_LCONV_DECIMAL_POINT=1 -DHAVE_STRUCT_LCONV_THOUSANDS_SEP=1 -DHAVE_ALLOCA_H=1 -DHAVE_STDINT_H=1 -DHAVE_VA_COPY=1 -DHAVE_SETLOCALE=1 -DHAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY=1 -DHAVE_LONG_LONG=1 -DHAVE_INTMAX_T=1 -DMPFR_HAVE_INTMAX_MAX=1 -DMPFR_HAVE_FESETROUND=1 -DHAVE_DENORMS=1 -DHAVE_SIGNEDZ=1 -DHAVE_ROUND=1 -DHAVE_TRUNC=1 -DHAVE_FLOOR=1 -DHAVE_CEIL=1 -DHAVE_NEARBYINT=1 -DHAVE_LDOUBLE_IEEE_EXT_LITTLE=1 -DHAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME=1 -DLT_OBJDIR=\".libs/\" -DHAVE_ATTRIBUTE_MODE=1 -DHAVE___GMPN_ROOTREM=1 -I. -I/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage-clang/local/include -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -m64 -O2 -march=corei7-avx -mtune=corei7-avx -g -MT add.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/add.Tpo -c add.c  -fPIC -DPIC -o .libs/add.o

```
So we'll have to fix logging with clang before we can investigate with this tool. I will try on OS X shortly.

Yes. Using a GNU extension - the word bug can be argued, but it fails to adhere to the standard which you do at your own peril and the cost of portability.

for what's worth, this is the `mpfr.log` I see on linux/gcc, after stripping the initialisation part, and running
`np.float64(5).__gt__(e)`; looks like `mpfr` is computing `exp(1.0)` to certain precision.

indeed, MPFR is first computing `exp(1)` with rounding towards -infinity, then again `exp(1)` with rounding towards +infinity.

Then it computes twice `52*0.25` with rounding towards +infinity (I wonder why the same value is computed twice).

Then it adds `-5` and `2.71828` with rounding towards -infinity and +infinity,
I guess this is to compare intervals for `5` and `exp(1)`.

Again it computes twice `52*0.25` with the same rounding, I don't know why.

As a person that has worked/ is working on rather exotic systems and do porting I consider it sad. It has been an extension for a rather a long time, if it was considered a useful or desirable feature it would be in the standard or planned for the next standard. That feature doesn't seem to have a big uptake either, we only had one package that absolutely required porting in sage so far.

Fortunately you don't use it in the functional part of mpfr but it is annoying.

My opinion is that while you make no claim to be standard compliant you should aim towards it and admit it as an issue, it does not have to be a show stopper bug.

feel free to report to the clang developers. It makes no sense to implement in MPFR a feature that should be implemented by the compiler.

Back to the issue, does `np.float64(5).__gt__(e)` give the warning with clang?

This will enable to see whether the warning occurs inside the `mpfr_exp` call
(you might want to replace `mpfr_printf(...)` by `mpfr_fprintf (stderr, ...)` if the warning is printed to stderr, and change `fflush(stdout)` into `fflush(stderr)`).

This is correct; there is no interrupt mechanics set that would make sure the warning printed immediately. The warning is printed **after** `numpy` completes the task of computing the value of 
`np.float128(5).__gt__(e)`, before it returns the result.

> Side question: what routine of MPFR (if any) does `np.float128(5).__gt__` call?

Numpy people told us some details [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9007#issuecomment-298935092). 
They say that behind the curtains it will try calling something like `e.__lt__`, assuming `e` is the argument (and all this happens within a compiled module written in (generated) C, making it hard to debug easily).

So we have two Python-based computer algebra systems not talking to each other too well...

my guess is the following:

(1) first intervals of MPFR values are computed that enclose 5 and exp(1)

(2) then those intervals are converted into the `np.float128` type

(3) then the comparison is performed

I guess the warning occurs because a NaN was generated in step (2). It might be inside the `mpfr_get_float128` function. Here is another patch to check:

IMHO it is different (and isn't in so by the complete(?) trace in comment 65 above): `numpy` has no way to convert MPFR numbers into `numpy` numbers,
without asking Sage to do this. And it does not even know that Sage can do it. So it all happens on the level of Python data: `numpy` knows that after getting "not implemented" from `np.float128(5).__gt__(e)` it may try `e.__lt__(np.float128(5))`.
And the latter invokes comparison in Sage, done with MPFR numbers.

> 
> (3) then the comparison is performed


Isn't the actual comparison is performed on MPFR numbers rather than on `numpy` numbers?
As above

```

> mpfr_add:TIM 0ms
> mpfr_add:OUT a[53]=-2.28172

is there a "greater" comparison? This is the one that would correspond to `__lt__` in the original call, as numpy people tell us.

here is somewhat less involved way to trigger this, not involving running through numpy evaluation loop

```
import numpy as np
from ctypes import cdll
from ctypes.util import find_library
libm = cdll.LoadLibrary(find_library('m'))
print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01)) # checks if FE_INVALID is set
bool(e.__lt__(np.float32('1.5')))
print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))
```
Running this on Linux/gcc produces

```
0
False
0
```
while on FreeBSD/clang I get

```
0
False
1
```

After I've found this, I decided to check whether merely importing numpy does something to the FPU flags on FreeBSD, and in fact it does! Namely, the output of

```
from ctypes import cdll
from ctypes.util import find_library
libm = cdll.LoadLibrary(find_library('m'))
print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))
import numpy
print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))
```
is

```
0
0
```
on Linux/gcc, and

```
1
0
```
on FreeBSD/clang! And in fact one can see that the FE_INVALID bit is flipped by

```
bool(e.__lt__(float('1.5')))
```
just as well:

```
sage: import numpy 
....: from ctypes import cdll
....: from ctypes.util import find_library
....: libm = cdll.LoadLibrary(find_library('m'))
....: print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))
....: bool(e.__lt__(float('1.5')))
....: print libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))
....: 
0
False
1
```
on FreeBSD/clang (but the last 1 becomes 0 on Linux/gcc).

I added a bunch of `print ("TAG: {}".format(libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))))` statements with various tags. The result changes from 0 to 1 in the file `sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pyx`, at the line `init_pynac_I()`. Within that function, it changes at the line

```
  K = QuadraticField(-1, 'I', embedding=CC.gen(), latex_name='i')
```
Quadratic fields are constructed using `UniqueFactory`, and the result changes from 0 to 1 in the `try/except` block

```
        cache_key = key
        print ("020: {}".format(libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))))
        try:
            try:
                return self._cache[version, cache_key]
            except TypeError: # key is unhashable
                print ("030: {}".format(libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))))
                cache_key = _cache_key(cache_key)
                return self._cache[version, cache_key]
        except KeyError:
            print ("040: {}".format(libm.fetestexcept(int(0x01))))
            pass
```
in the `get_object` method for `UniqueFactory` in sage/structure/factory.pyx. With the print statements as indicated, I see

```
020: 0
040: 1
050: 1
```
So is it something to do with the cache? The cache is defined by

```
self._cache = sage.misc.weak_dict.WeakValueDictionary()
```
So is something going on with Sage's weak dictionaries?

There is also the possibility that I'm misinterpreting everything and the problem is somewhere else completely.

A `KeyError` gets raised and Sage crashes on start-up:

```
KeyError: ((8, 0, 'beta5'), (Rational Field, x^2 + 1, ('I',), (Complex Lazy Field, 1*I), 'i', None, False, None))
```
If instead I print out self._cache, version, and cache_key, I see this:

```
self._cache: <WeakValueDictionary at 0x21bb99410>
version: (8, 0, 'beta5'), cache_key: (Rational Field, x^2 + 1, ('I',), (Complex Lazy Field, 1*I), 'i', None, False, None)
```

With ad hoc mpfr logging turned on, I see a lot of messages printed by mpfr between the "try" and "except" parts of the code. I don't know why. For example, if I add some print messages to `mpfr_set_d`:

```
020: 0
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal

 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal

 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
040: 1
enter mpfr_set_d
 exit mpfr_set_d: normal
version:(8, 0, 'beta4'), cache_key: (Rational Field, x^2 + 1, ('I',), (Complex Lazy Field, 1*I), 'i', None, False, None)
050: 1
```
("exit mpfr_set_d: normal" is printed if the end of that function is reached, as opposed to the special cases for 0 or infinity.)

line 121 of `set_d.c` is the following in mpfr-3.1.5 (if no patch was applied in Sage):

```
    manl = d;
```
A first suggestion is to add a cast:

```
    manl = (mp_limb_t) d;
```
Also, please could you compile with `-O0 -g` so that the debugger does not optimize out the value of `d`?

```

```
Alternatively, one could add at the beginning of `__gmpfr_extract_double`:

```
   printf ("d=%f\n", d);
```
to see which value of `d` produces the invalid exception.

Here is the result (coredump) of `f(1.5)` invoked as in comment 104 above:
{{{

after I recompiled mpfr and mpc with `-O0` (by using SAGE_DEBUG=yes)
In instead I do `f(p)` (exactly as in comment 104) the only difference I see
is 
{{{

ok, I can reproduce the issue on my Linux machine with the following program (where I replaced `mp_limb_t manl` by `long manl`):

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fenv.h>

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  long manl;
  double d = atof (argv[1]);

  printf ("fetestexcept() = %d\n", fetestexcept (FE_INVALID));

  manl = d;

  printf ("fetestexcept() = %d\n", fetestexcept (FE_INVALID));

  printf ("manl = %ld\n", manl);

  return 0;
}
```
which gives:

```
zimmerma@tomate:/tmp$ gcc -O0 e.c -lm
zimmerma@tomate:/tmp$ ./a.out 1.4488038916154245e+19
fetestexcept() = 0
fetestexcept() = 1
manl = -9223372036854775808
```
thus a possible explanation could be that `mp_limb_t` is a signed 64-bit type (aka `long`) on this platform, but I doubt.

Please can you check the output of this program (and the same by replacing `long` by `mp_limb_t` and adding the `gmp.h` header)?

In fact, as well, `FE_INEXACT` is raised, not only `FE_INVALID`.

By the way: sometimes, if I enter as input something smaller, say `1.44e0` I get no `FE_INVALID` raised, but instead `FE_INEXACT` is raised.

Entering `1.44e0` on Linux/gcc still raises `FE_INEXACT` after the assignment; on FreeBSD/clang `FE_INEXACT` is also raised at `d=atof()` call.

this is normal, since 1.44e0 is not an integer, and thus the integer conversion should raise the
inexact flag, but for `1.4488038916154245e+19` it should not be the case, since the value of `d` should be `14488038916154245120`, which is the closest 53-bit floating-point number.

We are making progress. Now I can reproduce the issue with clang on my Linux-Debian computer with the following program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fenv.h>

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  unsigned long manl;
  double d = atof (argv[1]);

  printf ("d = %f\n", d);

  printf ("fetestexcept() = %d\n", fetestexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT));

  manl = d;

  printf ("fetestexcept() = %d\n", fetestexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT));

  printf ("manl = %lu\n", manl);

  return 0;
}
```
which gives:

```

See e.g. related https://bugs.llvm.org//show_bug.cgi?id=8100

https://bugs.llvm.org//show_bug.cgi?id=8100 is a different issue. I hope they will fix bug 17686.
In the meantime the following ugly patch should fix the warning (in this code the value of `d` is
always greater or equal to 2<sup>63</sup>):

```
   manl = 0x8000000000000000 + (mp_limb_t) (d - 9223372036854775808.0);
