sage: type(acos(SR(2.)))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(acos(SR(2.)).pyobject())

Whoah.  Are you then saying we also shouldn't allow `log(-1)`?  After all:

```
sage: acos(CC(2))
1.31695789692482*I
```

I'm not cool with all of a sudden assuming symbolic things couldn't be complex, unless we are very consistent about this everywhere, and I suspect this would break a lot of stuff.    Your example with arc secant is a red herring, because


```
sage: asec(CC(0))
NaN
```

At the very least this sort of thing should be discussed on sage-devel, in my view.
