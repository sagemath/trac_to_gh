```
sage: f = piecewise([((-1,0), 1), ([0,1], -1)], var=x)

to say that the result here is more informative than NaN, although i suppose that the notion of domain is a feature not implemented for symbolic functions?..

```
sage: acos(CC(2))
1.31695789692482*I

I'm not cool with all of a sudden assuming symbolic things couldn't be complex, unless we are very consistent about this everywhere, and I suspect this would break a lot of stuff.    Your example with arc secant is a red herring, because


```
sage: asec(CC(0))
NaN
```

At the very least this sort of thing should be discussed on sage-devel, in my view.

I'm not saying we couldn't do that, but we would definitely need discussion on it and you are right that things should be consistent.  My guess is that making things consistent with your idea might lead to a lot of work being needed as well as other stuff breaking, but I am not an expert in numerics either.
