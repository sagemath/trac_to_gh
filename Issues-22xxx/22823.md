<a id='comment:1'></a>with a custom function this happens:

```
sage: f = piecewise([((-1,0), 1), ([0,1], -1)], var=x)
sage: f(2)
...
ValueError: point 2 is not in the domain
```

to say that the result here is more informative than NaN, although i suppose that the notion of domain is a feature not implemented for symbolic functions?..

We're far away from that unfortunately.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Whoah.  Are you then saying we also shouldn't allow `log(-1)`?  After all:

```
sage: acos(CC(2))
1.31695789692482*I
```

I'm not cool with all of a sudden assuming symbolic things couldn't be complex, unless we are very consistent about this everywhere, and I suspect this would break a lot of stuff.    Your example with arc secant is a red herring, because


```
sage: asec(CC(0))
NaN
```

At the very least this sort of thing should be discussed on sage-devel, in my view.
