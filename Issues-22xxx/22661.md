Sage's doctesting framework gives warnings about doctests taking longer than expected to complete.

These warnings should not be triggered as easily for tests and examples marked `# long time`.

This example code multiplies time limit to 10-fold for those. Real code should probably have an option for that, or `--warn-long` should accept a pair of real numbers.

I would argue that, if you don't want to see `--warn-long` warnings for `# long time` doctests, you should adjust the `--warn-long` argument accordingly.

In any case, I don't like the totally arbitrary 10x factor.
