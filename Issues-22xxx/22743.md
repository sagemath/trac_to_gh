It's building now so I can run some tests. But one question from looking through the code.

In a couple places you've changed

```
copy(Q)
```
to

```
self(copy(Q))
```
When copying a subscheme point it preserves the codomain, so is there a particular reason you're adding that extra coercion to the subscheme?

Everything else seems like standard clean-up.

yes, this is the main reason for this ticket.

I want all members of an orbit to belong to the same parent. If the given input is returned in the orbit, it does not belong to the K3, but to the ambient projective space. Try something like

[u.parent() for u in orbit]

With correct input, that works just fine for me.  The problem looks to me like it lies in the doctest not in the code:

```
sage: X = WehlerK3Surface([Z, Y])
sage: T = PP(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)
```

Notice that the doctest is mistakenly defining the initial point on the ambient space and not the K3 surface.


Your fix does prevent this bad input problem. That is what you're trying to fix?
