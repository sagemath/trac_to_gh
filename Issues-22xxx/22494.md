Hello,

some quick comments regarding code clarity.

Why in the function `ramified_primes(self)` do you need

```
raise ValueError("base field must be rational numbers or number field")
```
From what I understand it is not possible to construct a quaternion algebra over something else than a number field.

Are you sure one needs `hilbert_ramification` in the global namespace (modif. in `sage.arith.all`)? I would be in favor of removing all of `hilbert_symbol`, `hilbert_conductor`, `hilbert_conductor_inverse` from the global namespace.

```
ram = set()
for p in set().union([ZZ(2)], prime_divisors(a), prime_divisors(b)):
    if hilbert_symbol(a, b, p) == -1:
        ram.add(p)
return ram
```
could be

```
return set(p for p in set().union([ZZ(2)], prime_divisors(a), prime_divisors(b)) if hilbert_symbol(a, b, p) == -1)
```
(up to you, not sure it is more readable)

Keep spaces around `==`. `len(ram)==0` should be `len(ram) == 0`.

Why do you use once `set.union` and the other time `union`?

Hello,

Thanks for your review.

It is possible to construct a quaternion algebra over something else than a number field: try

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: A = QuaternionAlgebra(K,-1,x)
sage: A.ramified_primes()
```

But constructing it **from its ramification** only makes sense over certain fields, including number fields.

I am ok with removing `hilbert_*` from the global namespace, but that breaks backwards compatibility: several of these function were defined before my patch. Should they be methods of `QQ` or something else?

I will take into account your code suggestions.

The `set.union` vs `union` is because I simply moved around the existing code for the two versions of `hilbert_conductor`. I can uniformise it.
