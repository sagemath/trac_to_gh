The code performing mutations on `ClusterQuiver` does not handle properly
coefficients. In particular this introduces arrows in between frozen vertices
yielding issues when computing mutation classes.
Here is the smallest example I could come up with.

```
sage: B = matrix(3,[0,1,-1]); B
[ 0]
[ 1]
[-1]
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: list(Q.mutation_class())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The input digraph contains edges within the frozen vertices
```

The problem is that, rather than performing matrix mutations the code calls an
helper function performing digraph mutations. I do not see the rationale behind
this. Not only it is slower than the simple matrix operations needed to perform
mutations on matrices but it is also giving issues.

Here is another similar issue:

```
sage: B = matrix(3,[0,1,-1]); B
[ 0]
[ 1]
[-1]
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: Q.mutate(0)
sage: Q.b_matrix()	# this gives the expected output
[ 0]
[-1]
[ 1]
sage: Q.show()		# this output is wrong!!!
```

Note that consistency tests (which in theory should not be needed and which
contribute to the overall slowdown) are performed in `__init__` only when
creating a `ClusterQuiver` from a digraph.

Finally coefficients also force wrong answers from the algorithm computing
mutations classes:

```
sage: B = Matrix([[0,1,0],[-1,0,1],[0,-1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,-1],[0,-1,0]])
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: Q.mutation_class()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: The mutation class can - for infinite mutation types - only be computed up to a given depth
```

Actually a better example for the third issue:

```
sage: B = Matrix([[0,1,0],[-1,0,1],[0,-1,0],[2,0,0]])
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: Q.is_mutation_finite()
False
```

I finally managed to recompile sage and I gave a quick spin to this patch.
Something seems to be still wrong as it still fails on type A_2 cluster algebras:

```
sage: B = Matrix([[0,1,0],[-1,0,1],[0,-1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,-1],[0,-1,0]])
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: Q.mutation_class()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<ipython-input-17-64d1287a18f5> in <module>()
----> 1 Q.mutation_class()

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.pyc in mutation_class(self, depth, show_depth, return_paths, data_type, up_to_equivalence, sink_source)
   1883         """
   1884         if depth is infinity and not self.is_mutation_finite():
-> 1885             raise ValueError('the mutation class can - for infinite mutation'
   1886                              ' types - only be computed up to a given depth')
   1887         return [Q for Q in self.mutation_class_iter(depth=depth, show_depth=show_depth,

ValueError: the mutation class can - for infinite mutation types - only be computed up to a given depth
``` 



While having a look I could not avoid asking myself what is the point of `_digraph_mutate`.
It sounds like an extremely convoluted way of performing mutations. Dealing with
matrices instead should be as simple as 

```
def mutate(B, k):
    m = B.nrows()
    n = B.ncols()
    M = matrix(m,n, lambda i,j: -B[i,j] if i==k or j==k else B[i,j] + (abs(B[i,k])*B[k,j] + B[i,k]*abs(B[k,j]))/2 )
    return M
```

Is there any speed advantage in dealing with digraphs? Can some of the original contributors please comment on this point?

I just got an e-mail from Gregg. He basically says that the point of digraph is
to be able to label the vertices. Other than that matrices should be sufficient
and faster.

The only other things that comes to mind is that Christian might have done some
optimization to identify mutation classes and this might be based on digraphs.
It is probably the cheapest way to check for isomorphism of (valued) quivers.
Should we ask him explicitly to comment on this?

My impression is that there are now two competing codebases for doing mutations,
one with graphs and one with matrices, that somehow are simultaneously in
`ClusterQuiver` there should be quite a lot of room for cleanup. This does not
sound like a short term project though.

I think most of the mutation_type and mutation_finite code is made for the coefficient-free case and will be hard work to update. Even in your example of type A3 with coeffs, after being convinced to start mutating, it seems to find an infinite number of quivers...

I would suggest:

(1) close this ticket with the improvements it brings, including progress towards py3

(2) open another one for the mutation type and finiteness issues.

Hi,

this whole code clusterseed / quiver code seems to be a disaster, I wonder how much of it was actually broken from my first version of its code -- sorry at least for these originally broken parts!

> Is there any speed advantage in dealing with digraphs? Can some of the original contributors please comment on this point?


I have certainly spent a lot of time optimizing mutations, and used matrix mutation written in cython whereever possible. I believe, I have even used this for quiver mutations, but I am not totally sure.

I will try to give a slightly more informative comment tomorrow, hopefully after I had a look at the original code...

{
    "body": "<a id='comment:23'></a>\nOkay, it seems that the quiver code is indeed broken for frozen variables since a long time, maybe even from the beginning (we wrote the code initially without frozen variables), and we even used `_digraph_mutate` from the beginning. I don't see any reason for using `_digraph_mutate` but I don't recall why we used it in the first place either.\n\nThe b matrix mutation is cythonized from the beginning and was then as fast as possible, see the mutate method `matrix/matrix0.pyx: def mutate(self, Py_ssize_t k )`.\n\nI think I agree that `digraph_to_dig6` and `dig6_to_digraph` only deal with no coefficients. I actually don't think this is used at all in practice. Originally it is used to store mutation classes of quivers without coefficients for faster type recognition (and there, one never deals with coefficients).\n\nThe type recognition for seeds and quivers is done by taking the quiver without coefficients and determining its type by a nightmare case-analysis algorithm (I wrote it and knew from the beginning that it will be impossible to properly debug or understand, but it worked for all types...).\n\nThe `mutation_class_iter` method seems to be a horrible code duplication, done either for quivers (where `_digraph_mutate` is used in `mutation_class` line 253) or for seeds (where matrix mutation is used in `cluster_seed` line 3566).\n\nI would suggest to fix the broken quiver mutation method, and then first run tests if that fixes the issues with quivers, or if there are any further issues. And only then start improving the code, if desired -- though I had in mind that Salvatore's new stuff is anyway much better from all perspectives...",

Okay, it seems that the quiver code is indeed broken for frozen variables since a long time, maybe even from the beginning (we wrote the code initially without frozen variables), and we even used `_digraph_mutate` from the beginning. I don't see any reason for using `_digraph_mutate` but I don't recall why we used it in the first place either.

The b matrix mutation is cythonized from the beginning and was then as fast as possible, see the mutate method `matrix/matrix0.pyx: def mutate(self, Py_ssize_t k )`.

I think I agree that `digraph_to_dig6` and `dig6_to_digraph` only deal with no coefficients. I actually don't think this is used at all in practice. Originally it is used to store mutation classes of quivers without coefficients for faster type recognition (and there, one never deals with coefficients).

The type recognition for seeds and quivers is done by taking the quiver without coefficients and determining its type by a nightmare case-analysis algorithm (I wrote it and knew from the beginning that it will be impossible to properly debug or understand, but it worked for all types...).

The `mutation_class_iter` method seems to be a horrible code duplication, done either for quivers (where `_digraph_mutate` is used in `mutation_class` line 253) or for seeds (where matrix mutation is used in `cluster_seed` line 3566).

I would suggest to fix the broken quiver mutation method, and then first run tests if that fixes the issues with quivers, or if there are any further issues. And only then start improving the code, if desired -- though I had in mind that Salvatore's new stuff is anyway much better from all perspectives...

I will do a review of the code you provided. In principle, I find it much simpler to review changes that only have a single purpose, so having the formatting and py3 changes separated from the changes to the quiver mutation.

I would suggest, you move all formatting changes into another ticket which could go directly, and keep the actual behaviour modifications to `_digraph_mutate` so I can have a closer look at these and see how fixing the mutation issue there also fixes other issues we encountered.

I will post here whatever I encounter in the code, so that I keep track of what I understand, and for others to read and comment on.

> The only other things that comes to mind is that Christian might have done some optimization to identify mutation classes and this might be based on digraphs.


The big issue is that we consider quivers often as unlabelled graphs, see the `up_to_equivalence=True` flag in `mutation_class._mutation_class_iter`.

There are thus multiple issues to keep track of:

1. getting quivers into canonical form (by relabelling the vertices into a canonical ordering) and mutate at as least as possible vertices:
   * this is done in `_dg_canonical_form`, where the input quiver is put into a canonical form, while the relabelling of the vertices and the orbits of vertices under the isomorphism group is also collected.
   * this done, we only need to mutate at one vertex per orbit, and keep track that of the relabelling.

2. checking if we already have encountered a given quiver.
   * this is done using its dig6 string because checking if a string is contained in a set of strings is infinitely much faster than checking if a digraph is contained in a set/list of digraphs.

None of this was ever properly done for using frozen vertices.

`@`Frederic: am i correct that you now properly do the mutation with frozen vertices in `_digraph_mutate` ?

I hope things will work out again once also the dig6 stuff is properly updated what I will do now.

The reason to use `_digraph_mutate` over matrix mutation is that the canonical form algorithm 

```
    from sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs import search_tree, get_orbits
```
takes a digraph, so

1. starting with a quiver `Q`
2. taking its b matrix `B`
3. mutating the b matrix to `B'`
4. turning `B'` into a new quiver `Q'` (observe that `Q` and `Q'` largely coincide)
5. computing the canonical form of `Q'`

is much slower (especially for large quivers where the coincidence in 4. is even bigger) than directly doing the digraph mutation.

Observe that the actual mutation is indeed much faster on matrices, so having an equally fast version of the canonical form directly on matrices (take a square matrix and bring it into a canonical form up to simultaneous row- and column permutations) would be also solving the problem.

Okay, there are plenty of errors, I have fixed a few, but cannot push currently:

* `ClusterQuiver.canonical_label` has an obvious bug for frozen variables (it froze variables 0 ... m-1 rather then n ... n+m-1). fixed.

* `_digraph_mutate` still makes mistakes:

```
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(['B',2]).principal_extension()
sage: Q.mutate(0)
sage: Q.b_matrix()
[ 0 -1]
[ 2  0]
[-1  1]
[ 0  1]
sage: Q._digraph.edges(labels=True)
[(0, 2, (1, -1)), (1, 0, (2, -1)), (2, 1, (1, -2)), (3, 1, (1, -1))]
```
    The label for (2,1) should be (1,-1) if I see it correctly. (not fixed)

* the dig6 conversion is broken (not fixed)

* finally, vertices of the digraph different from 0 ... n-1, n ... n+m-1 are currently possible but not supported whatsoever (not going to fix)

> Observe that the actual mutation is indeed much faster on matrices, so having an equally fast version of the canonical form directly on matrices (take a square matrix and bring it into a canonical form up to simultaneous row- and column permutations) would be also solving the problem.


What about the following for a canonical form of a (coefficient-free) exchange matrix?

1) take the columns of B and sort each of them

2) sort the resulting lists lexicographically

3) 2 gives a permutation, use this permutation on rows and columns of B

To compare matrices in the canonical form you can then just use hashes.

I think you misunderstood the algorithm I was suggesting: 3 would be applied to rows and columns of B simultaneously, not to the sorted vectors in 2. 

In any case I think I was being stupid for other reasons: the algorithm proposed basically sorts vertices according to their in and out degrees (or actually some finer version of this where we keep track of how many arrows from distinct vertices are adjacent to each node). This is not enough information to distinguish any two quivers.
The first example that comes to mind is a "figure 8 quiver" with one vertex of degree 4 (2 in and 2 out) and 4 vertices of degree 2 (1 in and 1 out). The algorithm I had in mind can't distinguish the case with a 3 cycle attached to a 5 cycle from the case of two 4 cycles glued together.

Sorry about the stupid remark.

Stern but just :D

Since this is my day for random stupid ideas here is another.
Can't we use CAIV to speed up the process? It is known that the exchange graph
associated to any quiver with any choice of coefficients is a quotient of the
exchange graph associated to the same quiver but with principal coefficients.

Can we just pretend we always have principal coefficients(by artificially adding
them) and then perform mutations on the matrices only? Deciding if two seeds
coincide is just a matter of comparing the associated lists of c-vectors (and
this is fast). If we care about the up to equivalence case we can always check
for graph isomorphisms in a second time.

I am basically proposing to replace code duplication and digraphs with possibly
more mutations but performed much faster.

This is what me and Dylan do in `ClusterAlgebra` but there we never care about
the up to equivalence issue.

I am not sure I really follow how you want to do the check.

Please let me note that we want to list all quivers up to equivalence. The best way approach I know of is the following much more general algorithm using a canonical form (where two objects are considered equivalent if they have the same canonical form):

1. compute a new object (here using mutation from an old one)
2. bring it into a canonical form
3. check if you have seen this canonical form before (using a hash table)
4. if yes: discard the element
5. if no: store the canonical form in the hash table, and keep the element.

Observe that you must in particular compute the canonical form for each element you encounter.

I don't see how you could bypass this canonical form computation. In particular, I don't see how your approach could deal with this other than also computing it.

<a id='comment:47'></a>
Ok, let me try to explain a little better if I can.
Suppose that we have a square exchange matrix B and consider its 
its principal framing Bp (i.e. B with the identity matrix attached to the
bottom). Suppose for a moment that we want to list all the matrices in the
mutation class of Bp up to simultaneous permutations of columns and (the first
n) rows. 

Call the columns of the bottom part of a matrix obtained by mutations from Bp
its c-vectors.

Thm: B1 and B2 in the mutation class of Bp are equivalent if and only if the
sets of their c-vectors coincide.

So here is the algorithm to list all the matrices mutationally equivalent to Bp:
Start from Bp and perform mutations, at each step compare the set of c-vectors
with the one already known.
This completely solve the problem in the case of principal coefficients and is
much faster than any other implementation using digraphs and canonical forms for
comparisons.



Suppose now that Bf is any other rectangular matrix with the same B as the top
part. Suppose that B1f is obtained from Bf by a certain sequence of mutations
and suppose that B1 is obtained from Bp with the same sequence of mutations.
Then, obviously, the top part of B1f and B1 coincide. Moreover there is a
transformation (that depends only on Bf so it applies to the entire mutation
class) that expresses the bottom part of B1f in terms of the c-vectors of B1.
In particular if B1 and B2 are equivalent so do B1f and B2f for any choice of 
framing. 

It remains to test the situation in which B1 and B2 are distinct but have
equivalent top parts to see if B1f and B2f are equivalent. For cluster algebras
this is an irrelevant issue and we just do not care in our implementation.
Indeed the only relevant framing for the combinatorial structure of a cluster
algebra is the principal one.

If one is only interested in quiver mutations it could be relevant. In any case it
should be faster to compare using digraphs only the matrices the previous
algorithm produce rather than all of them.


In short: to compute mutation classes we do not need to solve the graph
isomorphism problem in full generality.

This might be correct, but is not totally obvious. The canonical form tells which vertices are equivalent, so we do not need to mutate all, but only one per equivalence class of vertices (orbits of the isomorphism group).

> Moreover there is a transformation (that depends only on Bf so it applies to the entire mutation class) that expresses the bottom part of B1f in terms of the c-vectors of B1. In particular if B1 and B2 are equivalent so do B1f and B2f for any choice of framing.

Isn't this complete thread and the algorithm about quiver mutations and not about cluster seed mutations? If I see your algorithm correctly, it would find the five non-equivalent quivers with principal coefficients, but how does this help to see that their top parts are actually all equivalent?

Some tests of the current versions of `ClusterQuiver` for the coefficient-free case (because I could not make the general case run) and `ClusterAlgebraSeed` with principal coefficients

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['D',10], principal_coefficients=True)
sage: %time _ = list(A.seeds(mutating_F=False))
CPU times: user 1min 25s, sys: 525 ms, total: 1min 25s
Wall time: 1min 25s
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(['D',10])
sage: %time _ = list(Q.mutation_class_iter())
CPU times: user 1min 18s, sys: 64.5 ms, total: 1min 18s
Wall time: 1min 18s
```
show that the two are comparable in finite types. 
Actually implementing what I suggest is worse because then one has to further
reduce the output according to coeffieicents.
I do not know how well `ClusterQuiver` scales as the number of coefficients
grows (assuming we can make it work).

Beyond finite types things are different because there are not as many
symmetries. For example

```
sage: B = matrix(10, lambda i,j: 1 if random() <0.5 else 0)
sage: B -= B.transpose()
sage: Q = ClusterQuiver(B)
sage: mut_class = Q.mutation_class_iter()
sage: count = 0
sage: %time while count < 100000: _ = mut_class.next(); count +=1
CPU times: user 3min 32s, sys: 13.7 ms, total: 3min 32s
Wall time: 3min 33s
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(B)
sage: mut_class = A.seeds(mutating_F=False)
sage: count = 0
sage: %time while count < 100000: _ = mut_class.next(); count +=1
CPU times: user 51.4 s, sys: 491 ms, total: 51.9 s
Wall time: 52.1 s
```

Just run the same algorithm you run now: digraph isomorphism. In this example
you point out my suggestion is way more expensive than the one you implemented:
I have to find 5 quivers and then test all of them to see that they coincide. 
On a not so symmetric case though my approach could save quite some time.

I am just saying we could consider the possibility to derive the algorithm for
quivers out of the algorithm for cluster algebras with (possibly?) a speedup.
Of course I am not even sure this is worth doing.

A bit of both: we mutate the top part by `sage.matrix.matrix0.Matrix.mutate` and the bottom part by hand. This is because we just wanted to keep c-vectors separate. We even perform several other computations that are needed for cluster algebras and that can be easily dropped if one only cares about quivers.

If one wanted to be smarter this could be entirely done with your cytonized code.

So let me rephrase to see if I understand correctly and whether we are on the same page:

The best version of your suggestion is that we could compute the complete mutation class of a symmetrizable matrix using the cythonized `mutate` method in `matrix0.pyx` and then compute all canonical forms after.

I will try to produce something similar to this and see how it compares...

<a id='comment:54'></a>
Yes, this is more or less what I was thinking of.

If the canonical form is able to distinguish also quivers with coefficients I would suggest this algorithm:

B input matrix possibly with coefficients

Append an identity matrix to B

perfome mutations with cytonized mutate on the resulting matrix and use the last n entries in each column to distinguish matrices.

return canonical form of the resulting matrices.

This last step is not necessary if, at some stage, we find an identity matrix among the possibly permuted coefficient rows of a matrix. I am not sure it is worth testing for this though.

I have provided a toy example how to do the mutations on matrices instead at https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/22381/2018_03-CythonTestMatrixMutation.py.

It is what I think is an improved version of what Salvatore and I discussed yesterday:

* I do not add any artificial principal coefficients but immediately do all possible matrix mutations and check for isomorphisms along the way. Reason: we have to canonicalize all matrices in the end anyways to check for duplicates. It is thus faster to do the canonicalization immediately after finding it and discarding if already existing (so we save additional mutations).

* This is now ~2 times faster that what I had before using digraph mutation, and not yet completely optimized.

* On the downside, more than 50% of the time is already spent in the canonical form cython function, so there is not much improvement possible currently.

* On the upside, this new code is much cleaner, since I never canonicalize the matrices themselves, but only save the hashes of their canonical forms.

Despite this code, I am not convinced it is worth changing all of `mutation_class` to use this new code given that I haven't used it in years and I would certainly takes days to get this done + proper debugging afterwards.

What do you think how to proceed here?

`@`Salvatore, I have a question concerning

>  Thm: B1 and B2 in the mutation class of Bp are equivalent if and only if the sets of their c-vectors coincide.


and in particular

> This last step is not necessary if, at some stage, we find an identity matrix among the possibly permuted coefficient rows of a matrix. I am not sure it is worth testing for this though. 


This seems not correct, since I believe you need to consider c-vectors up to index permutations:

Consider bipartite A3 with principal coefficients and mutable vertices 0,1,2. Then vertices 0 and 2 form an orbit of its graph automorphism group and mutating at 0 and mutating at 2 yield the same quiver, while in the first case, you have c-vectors

```
[(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 0, -1)]
```
and in the second case

```
[(-1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)]
```
which do not coincide.

Am I correct that there is no situation where you can forget about the isomorphism test, or am I misunderstanding what you meant?

In type A3, we have 10 different unlabelled quivers, while your algorithm found 14 = Cat(4).

Hi Christian,
sorry for being AFK for some time: this is quite a busy period so I am not as responsive as I should.

Concerning your question I guess you are right: from the perspective of (valued) quiver up to isomorphism you should allow also index permutations of the c-vectors. The thing I had in mind was quiver isomorphism relative to fixed principal coefficients. In short my suggestion was again bullshit and you should just disregard it.

I am glad that my nonsense somehow lead you to a faster/cleaner implementation anyway.

As for what you say concerning a clean implementation to be added into sage I am
more or less in the same boat as you. I have not used this code in years. The
only thing I currently use of it is the ability to transform various data into
an exchange matrix, afterwards I only use the code we implemented with Dylan. I
might put some effort into reviewing a ticket should it appear but I am not
really motivated to write one myself.
