I noticed while working on #22666 that the patch set for Python 3 on Cygwin includes a patch that applies to Python 2 as well, but that we don't currently include.

This patch increases the `FD_SETSIZE` macro on Cygwin, so that select can handle more than the default of 64 file descriptors.  This patch fixes #22718 (though for that I still prefer the more comprehensive workaround in #22746).

#22666 includes the same patch but for Python 3.
