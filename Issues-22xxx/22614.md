Some older code implements `__eq__` (or other comparison operators) for elements, copying part of the coercion model. Today, this should be done by implementing `_richcmp_` instead.

This ticket will only handle `DifferentialWeylAlgebraElement`.

The initial plan was to deal with more classes, but those are more involved than `DifferentialWeylAlgebraElement`.
