I was thinking on reusing the code available in the hyperbolic geometry module, plotting as in

```
g = HyperbolicPlane().UHP().get_geodesic(1+I,infinity)
g.plot()
```
what difficulties do you foresee? I really would appreciate any thoughts on this.

As a side question, why do we have two different ways of plotting something? I mean, we can plot a (hyperbolic or not) polygon from the geometry module and from the plotting module, is it for speed? is it worth the trouble of different output styles or implementations, double maintenance work?

That code will work, but it is more of normalizing things so that the infinity keeps going far enough to be "interesting" but not so far that is hides the behavior near **R**. This isn't so much a problem for a single arc, but more for polygons.

Some of it is that when we were working on the hyperbolic plane, we didn't necessarily know about the hyperbolic plotting. I agree that we should consolidate the code, but the hyperbolic plane code is somewhat more cumbersome to get simple plots. So I would still like some top-level function to plot arcs and polygons, but I would like to add additional options to choose the model.

I modified graphics.py  addition in an attempt to escape the technical difficulties you foresaw, at least in the "normal" use of this plotting functions.
I will open a new ticket to allow for poincare disc model as an option
