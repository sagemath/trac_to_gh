The test suite for Pari itself (e.g. `make test-all`) is broken on Cygwin.  Each test is given as a file containing commands that is piped to `gp`'s stdin.  However, it exits prematurely after reading just a few lines of each test.

The attached patch fixes the issue.  I didn't update the patch level on the package version yet, since it would conflict with #22633 (which is higher priority to fix first).

**Upstream bug**: https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1913

Upstream: Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.

Since the patches are rather simple, maybe it's easier to add both patches on the same ticket (say, #22633)?
