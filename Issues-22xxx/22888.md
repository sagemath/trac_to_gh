Configuration options for the Sage interpreter are hard to discover by users, even when some of them would be very useful even to newcomers. This ticket configures Sage's Jupyter kernel to add menu items for setting common options.

Examples (please add more!):

- typeset: whether to typeset outputs with latex+mathjax `%display latex`
  (default: False),
- preparse: whether to activate Sage's preparsing
  (default: True),
- automatic variables: whether to automatically create undefined variables ???
  (default: False),
- greedy completion: whether to do autocompletion on `foo().ba<tab>` (`%config IPCompleter.greedy = True`)
  (default: False),
- implicit multiplication: `implicit_multiplication`, eg recognize `2x` as `2 * x`
  (default: False).

This can be implemented in Sage's Jupyter kernel, by adding some appropriate javascript in a file `kernel.js` next to `kernel.json`.

Status: `@`minrk has implemented a minimal proof of concept that will be posted here soon.

In the longer run, one could add in the same way:
- a toolbar similar to that of SageMathCloud's notebooks, giving access to common commands,
- switching to "append only mode" where cells can only be started at the end,
- activation of notebook plugins?


Depends on #21959
