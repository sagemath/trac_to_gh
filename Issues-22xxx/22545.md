I would say those previous failures for inequalities were actually bad tests and probably should be deleted. At least, I don't see why anyone would fundamentally be comparing morphism as the data used by the `__cmp__` is not generally well-ordered, hence, essentially random.

Also, how do you feel about implementing a generic `__ne__` for every subclass of `SageObject` that does the `return not (self == other)`? (Of course, this would be a separate ticket.)
