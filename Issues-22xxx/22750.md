<a id='comment:3'></a>I don't really know the math, but I have some quick comments about the code:

- Sage uses `"""` instead of `'''` for docstrings.
- Your import of `from sage.stats.hmm import hmm` brings in numpy, so I would also lazily import your module.
- You have some Python2 specific syntax for an error message.
- You can do
  {{{#!diff
-G = copy(g)
-f = G.relabel(return_map=True)
f,G = g.relabel(inplace=False, return_map=True)
   }}}
- Short error messages should not start with a capital letter.
- `INPUT:` blocks should not be indented.
- 1 line descriptions should be on a separate line (e.g., not as `"""Short description.`).
- Not all methods have doctests.
- Use `not (self == other)` instead of `not self.__eq__(other)`.

<a id='comment:4'></a>Good suggestions.  On the issue of g.relabel, I wanted to do that, but the documentation says

```
   If "return_map" is "True" a dictionary representing the relabelling
   map is returned (incompatible with "inplace==False").
```
and I'm worried that this is not going to work in all cases.  I'll have a closer look at relabeling; perhaps the documentation is wrong.
