This bug was found in [#22091 comment:6](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22091#comment:6):

```
sage: R = MatrixSpace(SR, 2)
sage: G = MatrixGroup([R([[1,1],[0,1]])])
sage: type(G)
<class 'sage.groups.matrix_gps.finitely_generated.FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_generic_with_category'>
sage: G.register_embedding(R)  # declare coercion embedding
sage: loads(dumps(G))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'homset_category'
```
This ticket fixes the bug by implementing a `__reduce__` method similar to that of `FinitelyGeneratedMatrixGroup_gap`.

This ticket is a dependency of #22091.

Since matrix groups are not unique parents, when we do `loads(dumps(G))`, the embedding is not preserved and there is no coercion that can be found from the new copy of `G`.
