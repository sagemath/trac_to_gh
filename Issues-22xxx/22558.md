Currently, the method `.volume()` of the polyhedron class (see [.volume()](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/geometry/sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.html#sage.geometry.polyhedron.base.Polyhedron_base.volume)) does not handle unbounded polyhedron internally and lets `.triangulate()` return an error:

```

sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], rays = [[1, 1]])
sage: P.volume()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
in triangulate(self, engine, connected, fine, regular, star)
...
NotImplementedError: I can only triangulate compact polytopes.

```

One possibility would be to return infinity `oo` in this case.

<a id='comment:5'></a>What should be the expected behavior for non-compact non-fulldimensional polyhedra?

From reading #16045 it seems that currently `engine='lrs'` provides the volume in the affine hull while `auto` provides the volume in the ambient space. To make your new function agree with this, I would expect the following output:

```
sage: Q = Polyhedron(ieqs=[[0, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]); Q
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 ray
sage: Q.volume()
0
sage: Q.volume(engine='lrs')
+Infinity
```

Your version give `+Infinity` in both cases. 
I added the changes necessary for this, feel free to reset to your commit, if you don't like it. Perhaps it would be best to fix #16045 first.
