<a id='comment:2'></a>Some more thoughts: we should avoid code duplication as much as feasible here so that we don't have to chase all places where the version of the threejs is used when we want to change it. Perhaps something like this will work:
- generic method returns CDN scripts with `online=True` and throws an exception with `online=False`, these scripts include the version number
- backend-specific implementation provide appropriate paths to Sage package (which does not include the version number), and if they have to include a fall-back CDN section, they do it by invoking the parent method with `online=True` and embed that string in appropriate places

This way when upgrading threejs package one has also to bump version number in the generic method (and perhaps it should be mentioned in `SPKG.txt`), but backend ones will likely never require tweaking.

<a id='comment:5'></a>Automatic version matching is great, thanks for figuring it out!

It still seems to me that in `base.pyx` it would be better to have just

```python
scripts = backend.threejs_scripts(options['online'])
```
with the base backend class handling `True` case and more specific classes worrying about `False`. That way `BackendIPythonNotebook` could call parent method for extra bits instead of repeating the logic. Also, everything would be more in one place rather than the same thing split between `plot` and `repl`. But overall this design is already a nice improvement over current version.

<a id='comment:8'></a>Hopefully this is closer to what you had in mind.

I've included an error test in the base method, but this causes a doctest in `plot3d/base.pyx` to fail even with the keyword argument set explicitly. Do you know why the doctesting process ignores the keyword argument?

A workaround is to have the base method return an empty string when `online=False` but that's hardly desirable.

Regarding option ignoring - that's because you ignore them instead of doing `opts = self._process_viewing_options(kwds)` as other methods ;-) I'm looking at how things work and hope to post a solution shortly, will be useful for my understanding of option handling.

But you are using some of the options that are "standard" like `axes` and the problem was that it was not possible to pass threejs-specific options via standard means. So I am still convinced that my changes are on the right track. And it seems to me now that the next step is to keep only whitelisted options in this dictionary before sending them to template.

As a sage-on-distro person I disapprove of anything using `sage.misc.package` at runtime.

I don't have a better solution at this stage. Are different release on the CDN all that different? Do they have some backward or forward compatibility?

Only the IPython notebook does this, to provide a fallback requested by Eric. How would you do this more properly?
>Why SageNB is using CDN for offline case? Doesn't it have access to Sage installation which includes three.js?

The server directory to Three.js files doesn't exist in the current version of the notebook. A [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/424) was merged to provide that and the method will be altered when a newer version of the notebook is available.

Couple minor things:

1) In display manager documentation, "Three.js" should be capitalized and "offline" is one word.

2) I may want to reuse the `options` dictionary for handling future features, like setting iframe size from `figsize`, so it shouldn't be completely overwritten. Please introduce a different name on the next commit.

Our three.js package contrains only two files that we use instead of the whole repository, so it does not seem a big deal to me to keep it installed as part of Sage. In any case I think that for now (i.e. this ticket) we should keep it as is and modify to something else once (and if) it becomes a problem.

I am not trying to stay put on my island and I am all for isolation etc. But if use of `sage.misc.package` is prohibited, then perhaps it should not be exposed and look like an accessible functionality.

I don't suggest you change the status standard package for threejs either. I am encouraging you to think of a bigger picture regarding package management when you are not on your little island.

Yes, you are right there should be a higher level policy on this. `sage.misc.package` is an artefact of sage being its own packaging system and it has unwelcome tentacles all over the place. I am trying to convince people not create any more tentacles - like I killed most uses of SAGE_ROOT before. I shall bring it on sage-devel.
