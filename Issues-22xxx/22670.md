Some more thoughts: we should avoid code duplication as much as feasible here so that we don't have to chase all places where the version of the threejs is used when we want to change it. Perhaps something like this will work:
- generic method returns CDN scripts with `online=True` and throws an exception with `online=False`, these scripts include the version number
- backend-specific implementation provide appropriate paths to Sage package (which does not include the version number), and if they have to include a fall-back CDN section, they do it by invoking the parent method with `online=True` and embed that string in appropriate places

This way when upgrading threejs package one has also to bump version number in the generic method (and perhaps it should be mentioned in `SPKG.txt`), but backend ones will likely never require tweaking.

There is currently a failing doctest for something called "BackendDoctest". I'll fix that once I know we're on the right track.

Automatic version matching is great, thanks for figuring it out!

It still seems to me that in `base.pyx` it would be better to have just

```python
scripts = backend.threejs_scripts(options['online'])
```
with the base backend class handling `True` case and more specific classes worrying about `False`. That way `BackendIPythonNotebook` could call parent method for extra bits instead of repeating the logic. Also, everything would be more in one place rather than the same thing split between `plot` and `repl`. But overall this design is already a nice improvement over current version.

Hopefully this is closer to what you had in mind.

I've included an error test in the base method, but this causes a doctest in `plot3d/base.pyx` to fail even with the keyword argument set explicitly. Do you know why the doctesting process ignores the keyword argument?

A workaround is to have the base method return an empty string when `online=False` but that's hardly desirable.

Tweaked a bit backend code.

Regarding option ignoring - that's because you ignore them instead of doing `opts = self._process_viewing_options(kwds)` as other methods ;-) I'm looking at how things work and hope to post a solution shortly, will be useful for my understanding of option handling.

But you are using some of the options that are "standard" like `axes` and the problem was that it was not possible to pass threejs-specific options via standard means. So I am still convinced that my changes are on the right track. And it seems to me now that the next step is to keep only whitelisted options in this dictionary before sending them to template.

I don't have a better solution at this stage. Are different release on the CDN all that different? Do they have some backward or forward compatibility?

With Three.js the version number can matter greatly, unfortunately. Mr. Doob has made radical changes in the past that render the code not backward compatible. That doesn't happen too often but it will be an ongoing concern.

Why is this a bad thing to do?
> It is somewhat ugly that they call that CDN method when handling offline case, but it is kind of due to things not done completely properly.

Only the IPython notebook does this, to provide a fallback requested by Eric. How would you do this more properly?
>Why SageNB is using CDN for offline case? Doesn't it have access to Sage installation which includes three.js?

The server directory to Three.js files doesn't exist in the current version of the notebook. A [pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/424) was merged to provide that and the method will be altered when a newer version of the notebook is available.

Couple minor things:

1) In display manager documentation, "Three.js" should be capitalized and "offline" is one word.

2) I may want to reuse the `options` dictionary for handling future features, like setting iframe size from `figsize`, so it shouldn't be completely overwritten. Please introduce a different name on the next commit.

Our three.js package contrains only two files that we use instead of the whole repository, so it does not seem a big deal to me to keep it installed as part of Sage. In any case I think that for now (i.e. this ticket) we should keep it as is and modify to something else once (and if) it becomes a problem.
