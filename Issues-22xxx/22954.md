A special family of perfect and block graphs. See [Windmill_graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill_graph).

During [JCALM'17](https://team.inria.fr/coati/seminars-and-conferences/jcalm/17eme-jcalm/), J-C. Bermond recalled his (still open) conjecture that Wd(4, n) is graceful for all n >= 4 [1].
