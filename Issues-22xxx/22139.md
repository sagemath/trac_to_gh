This patch will add a `certificate`-option to functions checking finite poset is a semilattice.

I also suggest removing deprecated `meet_matrix()` and `join_matrix()` for posets (they are not at lattices).

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
This is kind of needs-review, but if this is OK, I must made the "dual changes" meet <-> join.

There was also a slight problem. Code like

```
try:
    make_some_matrix()
except ValueError:
    return False
return True
```

might -- at least in theory -- return `False` when there is some other error at Matrix creation (out of memory?).
