I only found one: "creating a elements" -> "creating an elements", which already have an error. Something else?

Currently there is 20 times "an Euclidean" and 6 times "a Euclidean", so even numbers don't help me.

I have a better idea.

I make a list of words used with both 'a' and 'an' article and put it to web page. Then some native english speaker selects those that should have 'a' and put that list on web. Then I make the patch, and we just ignore those lines where an error is translated to another error.
