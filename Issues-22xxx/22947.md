I only found one: "creating a elements" -> "creating an elements", which already have an error. Something else?

OK, then it not meaningful for me to do this. I mark this as *wontfix*.

Currently there is 20 times "an Euclidean" and 6 times "a Euclidean", so even numbers don't help me.

I have a better idea.

I make a list of words used with both 'a' and 'an' article and put it to web page. Then some native english speaker selects those that should have 'a' and put that list on web. Then I make the patch, and we just ignore those lines where an error is translated to another error.

The list would be something like 100..300 words I guess. It should be quite easy for a native speaker to read.

> I think at this point the best thing to do is just change all `an Euclidean` to `a Euclidean` and positively review this ticket (and fixing the one grammatical error noted in [comment:4](#comment%3A4)). I don't think we are quite at the point in time where we should do this systematically, i.e., there are more important things for us to spend time on.

As you wish.

(But it is not a big job, if someone later wants to do the categorization of "a" vs. "an" words.)
