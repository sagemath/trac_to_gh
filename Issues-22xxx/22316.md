While doing so, I also move the `LollipopGraph` into the `families` module.

Keywords: **barbell, dipole, lollipop, tadpole**

In method `TadpoleGraph`:
- You don't need networkx here. You can use:

```
G = Graph(pos=pos_dict, name="Tadpole graph")
G.add_cycle(list(range(n1)))
G.add_path(list(range(G.order(),G.order()+n2)))
return G
```
- The tests proposed are certainly too complicated. Also, you should test that with parameters (0,5) you have a path with 5 nodes, with (5,0) you get a cycle of order 5, etc.


In method `DipoleGraph`:
- no need to import networkx. You don't use it.
- what if `n==0`?
- The method could be simply (except may be for the case `n==0`): `return G = Graph([[0,1], [(0,1)]*n], name="Dipole graph", multiedges=True)`

Thanks for your review.

* I was using `networkx` since I've seen that in previous implementations of other graph families this is a common behaviour. But sure, I've modified that.
* What tests exactly are too complicated? I have removed the test of begin connected.
* I have added tests for extreme cases.
* Removed non-used call for `networkx` in `DipoleGraph`
* Removed the test for chromatic number
* The dipole graph is defined well for `n=0`. I have added relevant tests.
* I have adopted your shorter implementation for the dipole graph.

I have also rebased to develop. I am currently running tests, and after that I will push.

The use of networkx is historical. There is now no need to create a networkx graph and then convert it to a sage graph when we can avoid it. Actually, we should rewrite the lollipop method, among others, without networkx.


In method tadpole, the example that creates several tadpole graphs in a Sage graphics array is long to test and does not provide useful information. Actually, I have the same remark for lollipop graphs. I don't understand the need for long tests here.


In methods dipolegraph and tadpole, please use the following format.

```
EXAMPLES: 

Construct and show a dipole graph with 13 edges::

    sage: g = graphs.DipoleGraph(13)
    sage: g.show() # long time
```

you can also update method lollipop.

OK, so I will:

* use the proposed format for the dipole and tadpole graphs

Will hopefully happen tomorrow.
