CC:  @orlitzky

Let the argument be positive. I think the following should give `sqrt(6)`, and `6*sqrt(2)` respectively.

```
sage: (sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)).simplify_full()
sqrt(3)*sqrt(2)
sage: (sqrt(12) * sqrt(6)).simplify_full()
2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(3)
```
There is a Pynac ticket for this but we appreciate improvements of Maxima as well.

Is this also going to simplify `sqrt(-3)*sqrt(-2)==sqrt(6)`?  We've had this discussion before...

I don't remember but I hope it concluded that combining positive arguments is fine.

#12737 is the main place this sort of thing was discussed, though there are many.  Probably for positive is fine, but I'm no expert on this kind of thing.
