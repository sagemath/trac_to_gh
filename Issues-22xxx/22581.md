```
On a fresh build of Sage with `pyopenssl` installed, the test suite breaks at many places with complaints from `service_identity` not being installed. This is because a warning a printed when importing `twisted`:

```
:0: UserWarning: You do not have a working installation of the service_identity module: 'No module named service_identity'.  Please install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are satisfied.  Without the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL to support it, Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.  Many valid certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.
```
This causes various doctest failures, in particular in SageNB.

I started to review this ticket, and the install script looks ok, but what are 'script' type packages? They are not mentioned in http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html , and from reading the source code are also not listed by sage.misc.package.list_packages .
