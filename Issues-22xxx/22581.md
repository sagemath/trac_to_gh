On a fresh build of Sage with `pyopenssl` installed, the test suite breaks at many places with complaints from `service_identity` not being installed. This is because a warning a printed when importing `twisted`:

```
:0: UserWarning: You do not have a working installation of the service_identity module: 'No module named service_identity'.  Please install it from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/service_identity> and make sure all of its dependencies are satisfied.  Without the service_identity module and a recent enough pyOpenSSL to support it, Twisted can perform only rudimentary TLS client hostname verification.  Many valid certificate/hostname mappings may be rejected.
```
This causes various doctest failures, in particular in SageNB.

`pip` packages do support dependencies just like any other package. But you cannot have a dependency *on* a `pip` package, so `service_identity` should be an optional package.
