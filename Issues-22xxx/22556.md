Currently periodoic points can only be computed for morphisms. This ticket expands the functionality to rational maps where there are possibly infinitely many periodic points of a given period. Consequently, a parameter to return the subscheme of periodic points instead of a list of points is added.

To make this work for subvarieties, indeterminacy locus was modified to work for subschemes.
