Instead of running `cython` in a subprocess, use the `cythonize()` function from Cython to implement `cython()`.

This would ensure that `cython()` supports `# distutils` declarations. This will in turn make it a lot easier to compile code with `cython()` which uses Sage headers.

This ticket keeps all features of the old `cython()` command, even if those make less sense now. A future ticket would clean this up and deprecate various things.

Depends on #23799
