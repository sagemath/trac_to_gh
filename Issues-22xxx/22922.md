Hi Wencin,

Thank you for working on this feature! You need to stick to the Sage coding conventions to get your code into Sage, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html

In particular, you need a one sentence description of each method, followed by a longer description and INPUT and OUTPUT. But most importantly, you need

```
EXAMPLES::

    sage: Sym = SymmetricFunction(QQ)
    sage: LLT = Sym.llt(3)
```
etc which shows how to use the code and what output is expected. This serves also as tests that are run and checked with every new release, so this part is very important!

It would also be good if your code was integrated into the symmetric function setup, so that it can eventually used from there and replace the current implementation (if it is indeed correct and faster than the current implementation).

Anne

Hi Anne,

I have just attached a list of the running times with the running time for the existing implementation listed first, followed by the proposed one. Here are some selected examples:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
sage: L = Sym.llt(3)
sage: timeit("g1 = L.cospin([[3],[3],[3]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 6.09 s per loop
sage: timeit("g2 = L.llt_inv([[3],[3],[3]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 5.94 s per loop
```

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
sage: L = Sym.llt(3)
sage: timeit("g1 = L.cospin([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 3.26 s per loop
sage: timeit("g2 = L.llt_inv([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 3.58 s per loop
```

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
sage: L = Sym.llt(3)
sage: timeit("g1 = L.cospin([[2,1],[1,1],[2,1]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 4.76 s per loop
sage: timeit("g2 = L.llt_inv([[2,1],[1,1],[2,1]])")
5 loops, best of 3: 2.98 s per loop
```

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t']))
sage: L = Sym.llt(3)
sage: timeit("g1 = L.cospin([[],[],[]])")
625 loops, best of 3: 354 µs per loop

I did some old-school optimization of the current LLT polynomials. Since Wencin and Anne noticed that the current version uses the same mathematical algorithm as Wencin's newer version, we decided to focus more on doing the current improvements. This also includes some improvements to partitions. We now get

```
sage: L = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).llt(3)
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])
1 loop, best of 3: 853 ms per loop
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[3],[3],[3]])
1 loop, best of 3: 2.05 s per loop
sage: L = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).llt(4)
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[1,1],[3],[1],[2,1]])
1 loop, best of 3: 10.1 s per loop
```
versus the old

```
sage: L = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).llt(3)
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]])
1 loop, best of 3: 2.69 s per loop
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[3],[3],[3]])
1 loop, best of 3: 5.13 s per loop
sage: L = SymmetricFunctions(FractionField(QQ['t'])).llt(4)
sage: %timeit g1 = L.cospin([[1,1],[3],[1],[2,1]])
1 loop, best of 3: 24.4 s per loop
```

I did also do some optimizations to Wencin's code, which is available on this branch:

```
public/combinat/faster_llt_polynomials-old
```
However, it was only around a 10-15% improvement.
