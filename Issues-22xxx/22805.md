The function `cython()` currently adds a header to every `.pyx` file:

```
include "cdefs.pxi"
include "cysignals/signals.pxi"  # ctrl-c interrupt block support
include "stdsage.pxi"
```

If we want `cython()` to become less Sage-specific (see for example #22461), we should stop doing this. The user can still manually add the includes.

Moreover, Cython is trying to phase out `.pxi` files in general, which is an additional reason to get of those headers.

Note that I don't see an easy way to make this backwards-compatible. The only thing that we can do is to give a good error message (which is what this patch does). Because it's a backwards-incompatible change, it should preferably be done in a major version bump (i.e. Sage 8.0). Therefore I am making this a blocker.

Depends on #22695
