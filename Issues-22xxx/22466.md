This ticket provides the star and the stellar subdivision of a face of a simplicial complex.

The star of a face is the union of the faces that contains that face. The star of the empty face is the whole complex.

Given a simplicial complex C, the stellar subdivision of a face f of C is a new simplicial complex obtained as the barycentric subdivision of the face with respect to its star.

First few comments/questions:

* would it be pertinent to check that the provided simplex is actually a simplex in the considered simplicial complex ?
* You could provide non-working examples/tests to check such inconsistent user inputs.
* in `stellar_subdivision`, the `mutable` option is not taken into account (does not appear in the code).
* what is the difference between `is_mutable` and `mutable` option ?
* you should add an `INPUT` section in `stellar_subdivision`.

You should avoid lines longer than 80 characters. I see one here:

```
- `is_mutable` -- (optional) boolean, determines if the output is mutable, default ``True``
```

In a line like

```
def stellar_subdivision(self,simplex,inplace=False,is_mutable=True):
```
the style is to put a space after each comma.

In docstrings, use single backquotes or dollar signs – <code>\`F\`</code>, `$F$` – for math, but use double backquotes – <code>\`\`simplex\`\`</code>, <code>\`\`is_mutable\`\`</code> – for code.

In doctests, you need to put a double colon `::` before each indented line, not just a single colon. For example, you need two colons at the end of this line

```
The simplex to subdivide should be a face of self::
```

I'm assuming that you haven't actually looked at the built documentation or you would have realized that there were problems. It's good practice to look at the html documentation to make sure it is okay.

Dear jhpalmieri,

Thank you for the comments. Indeed, the double ticks slipped out of my mind for the code part.

I fixed the documentation, hopefully it should be okay now.

1) The first line of the 2 new methods should rather be

```
+        """
+        Return the star of a simplex in this simplicial complex.
```
and

```
+        """
+        Return the stellar subdivision of a simplex in this simplicial complex.
```

2) in the raise statements the convention is not to start with a capital and not to end with a dot, so something like

```
+            raise ValueError("this simplicial complex is not mutable")
```
and

```
+            raise ValueError("the face to subdivide is not a face of self")
```
and then change the doctests accordingly.

3) I would add "or on a copy" here:

```
+        - ``inplace`` -- (default: ``False``) boolean; determines if the
+          operation is done on ``self`` or on a copy
```

Otherwise, this looks good.
