#22764 did not update the bits added by #20437 to reflect the removal of the "python" symlink.

In the process of investigating this I also realized I did not create the symlink for Python 3 correctly in the first place (but this was not noticed since we don't currently link anything against the Python 3 libpython during a normal Sage build).
