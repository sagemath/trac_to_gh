Add `center()` to finite lattices.

For definition see http://planetmath.org/centerofalattice. As an example use maybe `Posets.DivisorLattice(60)`? Needs `neutral_elements`, so wait for next beta or build on top of #21903.

(Also "Elements and sublattices" in TOC should be splitted, maybe in this ticket.)

`git trac checkout 21903` returns an error. Anyway, here is the code

```
def center(self):
        """
        Return the center of the lattice.

        An element of a lattice is *central* if it is neutral and has a
        complement. The subposet induced by central elements is a *center* of
        the lattice. Actually it is a Boolean lattice.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: L = LatticePoset({1: [2, 3, 4], 2: [6, 7], 3: [8, 9, 7],
            ....:                   4: [5, 6], 5: [8, 10], 6: [10], 7: [13, 11],
            ....:                   8: [13, 12], 9: [11, 12], 10: [13],
            ....:                   11: [14], 12: [14], 13: [14]}
            sage: C = L.center(); C
            Finite lattice containing 4 elements
            sage: C.cover_relations()
            [[1, 2], [1, 12], [2, 14], [12, 14]]

            sage: L = Posets.DivisorLattice(60)
            sage: sorted(L.center().list())
            [[1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 20, 60]

        SEEALSO::

            :meth:`neutral_elements`.

        TESTS::

            sage: LatticePoset().center()
            Finite lattice containing 0 elements

            sage: Posets.ChainPoset(1).center()
            Finite lattice containing 1 elements

            sage: L = Posets.BooleanLattice(3)
            sage: L.center() == L
            True
        """
        neutrals = self.neutral_elements()
        comps = self.complements().keys()
        return self.sublattice([e for e in neutrals if e in comps])
```

14-element example is of smallest size with non-trivial center where neither neutral elements is subset of complemented elements nor other way.
