The following is a bug:

```
sage: S1 = Manifold(1, 'S^1') # the circle
sage: U = S1.open_subset('U') # the complement of one point
sage: Xt.<t> =  U.chart('t:(0,2*pi)') # the standard angle coordinate
sage: V = S1.open_subset('V') # the complement of the point t=pi
sage: Xu.<u> = V.chart('u:(0,2*pi)') # the angle t-pi
sage: S1.declare_union(U, V)
sage: e = S1.vector_frame('e') # a global vector frame (makes S^1 parallelizable)
sage: g = S1.metric('g')
sage: g[e,0,0] = 1
sage: g[[e,0,0]].display()
S^1 --> R
on U: t |--> 1
on V: u |--> 1
sage: g.inverse()[[e,0,0]].display()
S^1 --> R
on U: t |--> 1
```
The last output should be 

```
S^1 --> R
on U: t |--> 1
on V: u |--> 1
```
since the component g<sup>00</sup> of the inverse metric in the global frame e is the constant scalar field 1, which must have a representation on both open subsets U and V.
The current ticket fixes this.
