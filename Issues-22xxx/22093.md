This ticket fixes failing doctests in `geometry` when the optional `pynormaliz` package is installed,
as reported in #20885, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/IMlNMe5Xk5A

These doctests failures resulted from merging both #20885 (which introduced the pynormaliz-related features) and #18029.

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> Optional packages aren't really blocker material...


Is this your personal opinion? The (optional) testsuite is broken.

> Also, I can't even tell what this fixes; No ticket description, no added test. I'm sure you know what you are doing but we shouldn't rush this in.


Without the patch, some doctests **do** fail.
