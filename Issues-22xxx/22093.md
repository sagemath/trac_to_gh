Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A5):
> Optional packages aren't really blocker material...


Is this your personal opinion? The (optional) testsuite is broken.

> Also, I can't even tell what this fixes; No ticket description, no added test. I'm sure you know what you are doing but we shouldn't rush this in.


Without the patch, some doctests **do** fail.
