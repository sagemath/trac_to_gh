This is a followup to #22044 to fix that fix.  `bytes` and `str` objects should not be mixed together arbitrarily in Python 3, and having them both in the same list is generally a mistake except in some corner cases of code explicitly designed to consume both.  We should not set a bad precedent.

Again, this is both user and developer hostile--you are free to disagree with the design of Python 3 (though I'll point out this argument is something of a dead horse by now--Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and this argument has been had ad infinitum since then), but trying to fight against it is going to result in a big mess.

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A9):
> you are free to disagree with the design of Python 3

I am certainly taking that freedom :-)

I looked a bit more into this and I disagree even more with you now (nothing personal though!). According to [this](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#unicode-filenames) and [that](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments), Python 3 uses `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` for filenames while it uses ` locale.getpreferredencoding()` for `Popen(universal_newlines=True)`. This means that your code might break in the case that these two encodings differ.

The existing code using `bytes` doesn't care about encodings at all, so it doesn't have this problem.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:12\" align=\"right\">Comment 12</div>\n\nI'm afraid you don't have that freedom--the rest of the world does.  I'd be surprised if I had to say that though.\n\n> This means that your code might break in the case that these two encodings differ.\n\nThis is actually a perfect reason for why you should decode to text.  In this particular example you're calling a problem that is *outputting* the name of a file.  I actually have no idea how `gp` handles encodings, if it even does at all.  But *in principle* it can be outputting filenames as text in a different encoding than it was stored in the filesystem (in gp's case it's probably just trying the filenames are raw byte strings though and not dealing with encodings at all, this is true).  On Windows, the locale encoding and the filesystem encoding can definitely be different (this is increasingly less the case but will still turn up, especially in Asian countries).\n\nIn fact, on *nix it doesn't generally matter because `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` is *the same* as the locale encoding at the time the Python interpreter is started as documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding) and you can see also [here](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Python/pylifecycle.c#l984).  This is because there is no reliable way to make assumptions about filesystem encoding on *nix, and of course files on Unix are just bytes anyways and that's more or less how Python treats them.  If your locale happens to use the encoding that filenames were saved as (which it generally will if your system is properly configured, or you're not SSHing to strange machines) then you're in luck--you can actually read your filenames.  If they don't match up you might get gibberish but at least the surrogateescape handler protects you from losing information.  In the vast majority of cases you just get the right text though.\n\nThe idiom you're expected to use in Python 3 is referred to as the \"unicode sandwich\".  Only use `bytes` objects immediately at the boundary of the system and the application.  Use `str` everywhere else for processing, and then `bytes` again only when going back out to the system.

I'm afraid you don't have that freedom--the rest of the world does.  I'd be surprised if I had to say that though.

> This means that your code might break in the case that these two encodings differ.

This is actually a perfect reason for why you should decode to text.  In this particular example you're calling a problem that is *outputting* the name of a file.  I actually have no idea how `gp` handles encodings, if it even does at all.  But *in principle* it can be outputting filenames as text in a different encoding than it was stored in the filesystem (in gp's case it's probably just trying the filenames are raw byte strings though and not dealing with encodings at all, this is true).  On Windows, the locale encoding and the filesystem encoding can definitely be different (this is increasingly less the case but will still turn up, especially in Asian countries).

In fact, on *nix it doesn't generally matter because `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` is *the same* as the locale encoding at the time the Python interpreter is started as documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding) and you can see also [here](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Python/pylifecycle.c#l984).  This is because there is no reliable way to make assumptions about filesystem encoding on *nix, and of course files on Unix are just bytes anyways and that's more or less how Python treats them.  If your locale happens to use the encoding that filenames were saved as (which it generally will if your system is properly configured, or you're not SSHing to strange machines) then you're in luck--you can actually read your filenames.  If they don't match up you might get gibberish but at least the surrogateescape handler protects you from losing information.  In the vast majority of cases you just get the right text though.

The idiom you're expected to use in Python 3 is referred to as the "unicode sandwich".  Only use `bytes` objects immediately at the boundary of the system and the application.  Use `str` everywhere else for processing, and then `bytes` again only when going back out to the system.  Most users never even have to use `bytes` directly because library authors who have thought about this a lot more than the user has have already handled this (such as in much of Python's stdlib, or libraries like Paramiko or Werkzeug).

First of all, on OS X, it seems that the encodings can be different: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Python/bltinmodule.c#l25

Second (see also [comment:11]), why should I even care about such implementation details like whether or not Python thinks that the filesystem encoding and locale encodings are the same.

But it seems that you insisting on this, so I suggest the following solution: instead of using `universal_newlines`, explicitly decode with `sys.getfilesystemencoding()`.

Well I don't know if you mean in general or why I bring it up.  In general you'd want to know so that you can understand and debug any encoding issues that *might* arise and it's helpful to know how Python is determining things on different platforms.

In particular I bring it up because you write:

> According to ​this and ​that, Python 3 uses `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` for filenames while it uses `locale.getpreferredencoding()` for `Popen(universal_newlines=True)`. This means that your code might break in the case that these two encodings differ.

And I'm pointing out to you that on Linux at least these are both the same thing.  The only reason the different functions are being used in the different contexts is because on *some* systems (particularly Windows) they are not the same.


> But it seems that you insisting on this, so I suggest the following solution: instead of using `universal_newlines`, explicitly decode with `sys.getfilesystemencoding()`.

You could do that and in many cases it would be fine (on Linux it will be fine because it's the same as what it's already doing--but then why introduce the extra step unnecessarily?).  But in the general case that is not necessarily the correct thing to do.

<div id="comment:18" align="right">Comment 18</div>

Let me show you a concrete example.  This is in Windows, and isn't directly applicable to this ticket, though it is *possible* to construct such a scenario on Linux as well.

Let's say I make a filename with some unicode characters in it:

```python
>>> import os
>>> os.mkdir('temp')
>>> os.chdir('temp')
>>> os.listdir('.')
[]
>>> filename = 'résumé.txt'
>>> open(filename, 'w').close()
>>> os.listdir('.')
['résumé.txt']
```

As you can see, `os.listdir('.')` correctly decodes the filename, in this case using `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` which happens to be:

```python
>>> os.listdir(b'.')
[b'r\xe9sum\xe9.txt']
>>> sys.getfilesystemencoding()
'mbcs'
>>> os.listdir(b'.')[0].decode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())
'résumé.txt'
```

Here `'mbcs'` is not a specific encoding--rather, it means to decode with the system default multi-byte codepage.  Frequently this is the same as what `locale.getpreferredencoding()` is but it doesn't have to be.

But let's try a particularly ugly example of where you can go wrong with bad assumptions (and in this case Python's default assumption is wrong too--I'm not arguing that it will always be right):

```python
>>> import subprocess as sp
>>> p = sp.Popen(['cmd.exe', '/c', 'dir', '/B'], stdout=sp.PIPE)
>>> out, _ = p.communicate()
>>> out
b'r\x82sum\x82.txt\r\n'
```

Well, what it is printing are *filenames*, but does that mean the encoding has anything to do with `sys.getfilesystemencoding()`?  No!

```python
>>> out.decode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())
'r\u201asum\u201a.txt\r\n'
```

It happens to decode without errors, but...

```python
>>> import unicodedata
>>> unicodedata.name('\u201a')
'SINGLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK'
```

Whatever that is.  So if I just assumed "well, this program prints filenames, and filenames are just bytes, so that must be the filename and I'll pass it around the application as bytes", once I try to pass it back to a system call:

```python
>>> out_filename = out.rstrip()
>>> open(out_filename).read()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: b'r\x82sum\x82.txt'
```

Part of what makes this a particularly nasty example is that here `universal_newlines=True` isn't necessarily right either.  This is *particular* to `cmd.exe` on Windows, which is allowed to default to *any* codepage, not just the one associated with the system's current locale.  This is for the sake of supporting legacy DOS-based applications that are not aware of or are not compatible with the OS's locale codepage.  In fact my `cmd.exe` is currently set to `'cp850'`, so:

```python
>>> out_filename.decode('cp850')
'résumé.txt'
```

So in the particular case of running `'cmd.exe'` (to which the `subprocess` module is agnostic) I do have to take output as bytes and worry about the correct encoding to decode with.  With most "modern" software--including modern command line applications built on Windows--this is less likely to be a problem.  Regardless, `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` was the wrong assumption. (Annoyingly, `universal_newlines=True` defaults to `locale.getpreferredencoding()` which may, in cases like this, not be correct either. Somehow an explicit `encoding` argument was not added to `subprocess.Popen` until Python 3.6.)

You can concoct a similar example on Linux by setting your current locale to some encoding and writing out some files with non-ASCII filenames, then changing your locale to use a different encoding and run `Popen(['ls'])` or something like that.  That said, this is not the average case, so it's not worth throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
