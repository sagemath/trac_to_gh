Sage now contains various lines of the form `from builtins import ...` which is provided by the `future` package.

Currently, `pyparsing` is needed for `src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_examples.py`, which we solve with a lazy import.

Rebase to 7.6.rc1 and updated (now also `pyparsing` is needed).

`six` is indirectly installed as dependency of IPython. It is not needed to explicitly add it as dependency of `SAGERUNTIME`.

Could it be that some package requires `six` in Python 3 but not in Python 2 (that would be surprising, but it would explain things).

I get an unpickling failure:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 74.2 src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx", line 1526, in sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all
Failed example:

Expected:

    Failed:
    _class__sage_homology_examples_SimplicialSurface__.sobj
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** This error is probably due to an old pickle failing to unpickle.

1 item had failures:
   1 of  11 in sage.structure.sage_object.unpickle_all

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 74.2 src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx  # 1 doctest failed

```
This is due to the change in importing the simplicial complex catalog, which I think is not necessary for this ticket.

True, it is not needed. However, I did it by analogy with the other catalog. Anyway, the pickling problem is easily solved by moving the `unpickle_override` to the file `all.py` which is always imported.
