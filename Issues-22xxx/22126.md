Sage now contains various lines of the form `from builtins import ...` which is provided by the `future` package.

Currently, `pyparsing` is needed for `src/sage/homology/simplicial_set_examples.py`, which we solve with a lazy import.

Rebase to 7.6.rc1 and updated (now also `pyparsing` is needed).

`six` is indirectly installed as dependency of IPython. It is not needed to explicitly add it as dependency of `SAGERUNTIME`.

I might have a look later...

Could it be that some package requires `six` in Python 3 but not in Python 2 (that would be surprising, but it would explain things).

I get an unpickling failure:

```

This is due to the change in importing the simplicial complex catalog, which I think is not necessary for this ticket.

True, it is not needed. However, I did it by analogy with the other catalog. Anyway, the pickling problem is easily solved by moving the `unpickle_override` to the file `all.py` which is always imported.
