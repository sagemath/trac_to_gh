Issues like #22628 remind me of an idea I've had before for improving the situation with the otherwise difficult to maintain and unwieldy `sage.env` module.

ISTM that almsot all the data in that file could be read from a plain text file format (either an ini-like file or JSON, for example).  Furthermore, this file could be generated, or updated, at install time for spkgs (including Sage itself).  This would help make the growing number of (sometimes contentious) spkg-specific variables (`CONWAY_POLYNOMIALS_DATA_DIR`, `GRAPHS_DATA_DIR`, `GAP_ROOT_DIR`, `SINGULAR_SO`, etc.) more manageable.

If each spkg is allowed its own "section" in this config file, the installers for those spkgs could be allowed to manage the data in that section as well, which is sometimes platform-specific.  It is also data that is usually more accessible at install-time of that package than it is to Sage at runtime.  For example, #22628 raises a tricky issue about how to set `SINGULAR_SO`.  If the correct path to `SINGULAR_SO` were written to a config file at install time, that would push all platform-specific logic about how to set that path to the `spkg-install` script, and out of `sage.env`.  For system packagers, such as for Gentoo or Debian, they would be free to write whatever they want in this config file, and it would free them having to do as much patching to `sage.env` and possibly other files.

I have some idea how this might work, so I'm willing to cook up a prototype if it doesn't sound like a terrible idea.

Depends on #27040

Instead of *one file*, having *one directory* where each package can write a file seems like a much better idea. Think of `pkgconfig`: we don't have one `pkgconfig` file, we have a directory `local/lib/pkgconfig` with one file per package.

It's not clear to me if you plan to change only the Python module `sage.env` or also the shell script `src/bin/sage-env`. Ideally, your idea should also reduce duplication/complexity in `sage-env`.

I'm adding #21479 as dependency because of potential conflicts.

I need to take a closer look but my hope is that such a config file could reduce complexity in *both* `sage-env` and `sage.env`.

There are also packages that require special environment variables to be set in `sage-env`.  Those include:

This might be a job for #15087 like functionality.

There are some cases that are somewhat non-trivial, such as the environment settings for R (which, for consistency's sake, would be nice to move entirely to its own file).\n\nA related, but alternative approach I'm considering is that rather than sourcing these files directly, they should be executable scripts that do nothing but print out the environment variables that they should set.  So, for example, rather than `source $SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage/env.d/pkgname.sh`, one would <code>eval \\`$SAGE_LOAL/etc/sage/env.d/pkgname.sh\\`</code>.  Or something like that.",

I'm reconsidering this now that I've gotten a little deeper into implementation.  There are some cases that are somewhat non-trivial, such as the environment settings for R (which, for consistency's sake, would be nice to move entirely to its own file).

A related, but alternative approach I'm considering is that rather than sourcing these files directly, they should be executable scripts that do nothing but print out the environment variables that they should set.  So, for example, rather than `source $SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage/env.d/pkgname.sh`, one would <code>eval \`$SAGE_LOAL/etc/sage/env.d/pkgname.sh\`</code>.  Or something like that.

Instead of a plain-text config file, in #29022 I generate a Python module.

The issue with the library dir configuration (`SINGULAR_SO`) mentioned in the ticket description has again come up in #29013 (venv).
It should indeed be fixed by just writing out the configured library path to the new configuration file.
