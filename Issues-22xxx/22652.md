Issues like #22628 remind me of an idea I've had before for improving the situation with the otherwise difficult to maintain and unwieldy `sage.env` module.

ISTM that almsot all the data in that file could be read from a plain text file format (either an ini-like file or JSON, for example).  Furthermore, this file could be generated, or updated, at install time for spkgs (including Sage itself).  This would help make the growing number of (sometimes contentious) spkg-specific variables (`CONWAY_POLYNOMIALS_DATA_DIR`, `GRAPHS_DATA_DIR`, `GAP_ROOT_DIR`, `SINGULAR_SO`, etc.) more manageable.

If each spkg is allowed its own "section" in this config file, the installers for those spkgs could be allowed to manage the data in that section as well, which is sometimes platform-specific.  It is also data that is usually more accessible at install-time of that package than it is to Sage at runtime.  For example, #22628 raises a tricky issue about how to set `SINGULAR_SO`.  If the correct path to `SINGULAR_SO` were written to a config file at install time, that would push all platform-specific logic about how to set that path to the `spkg-install` script, and out of `sage.env`.  For system packagers, such as for Gentoo or Debian, they would be free to write whatever they want in this config file, and it would free them having to do as much patching to `sage.env` and possibly other files.

I have some idea how this might work, so I'm willing to cook up a prototype if it doesn't sound like a terrible idea.

Instead of *one file*, having *one directory* where each package can write a file seems like a much better idea. Think of `pkgconfig`: we don't have one `pkgconfig` file, we have a directory `local/lib/pkgconfig` with one file per package.

It's not clear to me if you plan to change only the Python module `sage.env` or also the shell script `src/bin/sage-env`. Ideally, your idea should also reduce duplication/complexity in `sage-env`.

I'm adding #21479 as dependency because of potential conflicts.

I agree--one file per package sounds better, and will also have fewer problems in parallel builds.

I need to take a closer look but my hope is that such a config file could reduce complexity in *both* `sage-env` and `sage.env`.

The only thing with `sage-env` is that it should be easy to read/parse the file without, say, invoking a Python interpreter.  That's another good argument for one per-package config files, as that would reduce the complexity of the format.  Probably a `<key>=<value>` format would be good enough.

To be clear, I would still allow all these options to be read from environment variables too, and environment variables would override config files.  But this might also reduce the number of environment variables that need to be set.

Another possible advantage is the ability for per-user config files that override the globals, but I would leave that as a separate task.

One thing I'm struggling with a bit on this is, if this is implemented, what the upgrade path should look like.

The idea is to generate these config files at build time.  So how will they be generated for packages that are already built?  Maybe I should just increase the patch levels on those packages?  I think the only packages that might get their own config files are currently:

* conway_polynomials
* graphs
* elliptic_curves
* polytopes_db
* gap
* thebe
* singular

plus sagelib itself.  Any others?  I determined this (rough) list based on those packages that require any settings in `sage.env`.

There are also packages that require special environment variables to be set in `sage-env`.  Those include:

* jupyter
* matplotlib
* r
* maxima
* ecl
* ncurses

This might be a job for #15087 like functionality.

Instead of a plain-text config file, in #29022 I generate a Python module.

The issue with the library dir configuration (`SINGULAR_SO`) mentioned in the ticket description has again come up in #29013 (venv).
It should indeed be fixed by just writing out the configured library path to the new configuration file.
