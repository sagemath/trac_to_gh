This is a ticket to further track the issue I described here: 

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/y79rSTdBLQA/LnkO66FCAwAJ

In short, after the master pty is closed when quitting the pexpect interface, ecl has inconsistent error handling on failed reads/writes to stdio.  On Cygwin this actually leads to a busy wait loop that, while possible to terminate, takes a long time due to the use in Sage of `terminate_async`, and the slowness of `fork()` on Cygwin.

This is particularly a problem when running the test suite, where lots of maxima pexpect interfaces are being started and stopped in rapid succession.  This leads to a snowball effect of processes that take forever to exit and eat up the CPU.

This is fixed upstream in ECL: https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/merge_requests/51

Also considering reporting to newlib its difference with glibc on this, although I don't think its behavior is wrong either.

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**
