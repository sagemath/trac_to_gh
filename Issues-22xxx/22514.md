Constants in an InfinitePolynomialRing are missing many expected methods.  For example:

```
sage: R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a = R(3)
sage: b = 3 + x[0]
sage: type(a)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'>
sage: type(b)
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'>
sage: b.is_constant()
False
sage: a.is_constant()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-4b9a13af2a7a> in <module>()
----> 1 a.is_constant()

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.pyc in __getattr__(self, s)
    409             return getattr(self._p,s)
    410         except AttributeError:
--> 411             raise AttributeError('%s has no attribute %s'%(self.__class__, s))
    412 
    413     def ring(self):

AttributeError: <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'> has no attribute is_constant
```

Another example:

```
sage: b.constant_coefficient()
3
sage: a.constant_coefficient()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    409             return getattr(self._p,s)
    410         except AttributeError:
--> 411             raise AttributeError('%s has no attribute %s'%(self.__class__, s))
    412 
    413     def ring(self):

AttributeError: <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'> has no attribute constant_coefficient
```

And another:

```
sage: b.degree()
1
sage: a.degree()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-1191944a72df> in <module>()
----> 1 a.degree()

/opt/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/rings/polynomial/infinite_polynomial_element.pyc in __getattr__(self, s)
    409             return getattr(self._p,s)
    410         except AttributeError:
--> 411             raise AttributeError('%s has no attribute %s'%(self.__class__, s))
    412 
    413     def ring(self):

AttributeError: <class 'sage.rings.polynomial.infinite_polynomial_element.InfinitePolynomial_sparse'> has no attribute degree
```

This appears to follow from the type of the ``_p`` field of the values:

```
sage: type(b._p)
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.multi_polynomial_libsingular.MPolynomial_libsingular'>
sage: type(a._p)
<type 'sage.rings.finite_rings.integer_mod.IntegerMod_int'>
```

When the base ring is itself a polynomial ring, we can get mathematically incorrect answers:

```
sage: S.<y> = ZZ[]
sage: Q.<z> = InfinitePolynomialRing(S)
sage: a = Q(1+y)
sage: a
y + 1
sage: b = (1+y+z[0]) - z[0]
sage: b
y + 1
sage: a.parent()
Infinite polynomial ring in z over Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
sage: b.parent()
Infinite polynomial ring in z over Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
sage: a == b
True
sage: a.is_constant()
False
sage: b.is_constant()
True
sage: a.constant_coefficient()
1
sage: b.constant_coefficient()
y + 1
```
`b` is giving the correct answers, while `a` is not.

There are also issues when creating from strings:

```
R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: R(3).parent()
Infinite polynomial ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: R("3").parent()
Integer Ring
```

Other polynomial rings work differently:

```
sage: S.<y> = ZZ[]
sage: S(3).parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
sage: S("3").parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
```

I am not at all sure that this is the right way to fix the problem, but it is one way to do it.  I got a bit lost in the thickets of the coercion system trying to find a more reasonable place than in the `__init__` method (which has a comment stating that all the needed checks should already have been done elsewhere).

To the question

```
# is there a better way to recognize polynomials than this "duck typing"?

the answer is yes

```

sage: p1 = ZZ['x'].an_element()
sage: p2 = ZZ.an_element()

Re: "In the doctests, you need to have a line break before the first example and indent the examples ..."

Indeed this was a mistake; I have pushed a fix.

Re "This behavior is wrong  ... `R.gens_dict()['1']` ...": that's the way it worked before these patches.  I agree it is wrong, but seems unrelated to this ticket.  Should it perhaps be a new issue?

Strangely enough, `R.gens_dict()[s]` does not exhibit this problem for s = `'0'` or s = `'2'`; the underlying issue seems to be this:

```
sage: QQ.gens_dict()
{'1': 1}
```

You can get a similar issue with 

```
sage: GaussianIntegers().gens_dict()
{'I': I}
sage: R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(GaussianIntegers())
sage: R.gens_dict()['I']
I
```

I am not completely sure about that. The infinite polynomial ring is considered as tower of polynomial rings, which we really are considering as algebras over a base ring `R`. In this tower, there is a ring isomorphic to `R`, which is generated by `1` as an `R`-algebra. This is in line with, e.g., **Q**:

```
sage: QQ.gens()
(1,)
```
As @videlec points out, this is inconsistent with polynomial rings in Sage:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 0, 'x')
sage: R.gens()
()
```
Yet, to me, this says that the polynomial ring over `R` with 0 variables is precisely `{0}`. So I would instead classify this behavior of polynomial rings as a bug.

However, this is a little tangential to this ticket and probably should be a separate ticket.

Replying to [comment:13](#comment%3A13) from tscrim:

An old discussion on sage-devel, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/BRE2F90oezU/xmKC86SRllEJ;context-place=forum/sage-devel suggests the following rule: if `R.base_ring()` is not `R`, then `R.gens()` should return the generators for R over its base ring.  So in your example, `R.base_ring()` is `QQ`, which is not `R` if we are being pedantic (ind indeed Sage is), and so a slavish adoption of the rule says that the empty set of generators is in fact the right answer.

The same rigid adoption of this rule says Sage is wrong here:

```
sage: R.<x> = InfinitePolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: R.ngens()
1
```
Surely the answer should be `+Infinity`.  I can see that the `gens_dict` we get for this makes some kind of sense, with an apparent infinity of keys, but `gens` seems wrong - it returns  one "generator" that is not even an element of the ring.

I'll do up a separate ticket on the generators.  With that, can *this* ticket go back to the needs_review state (or maybe positive_review), or is there still some other issue?
