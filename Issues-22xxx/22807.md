Trying to compile 8.0.beta1 on cygwin64, I get the following error in `libfplll`:

```

I tried to add `CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -Wa,-mbig-obj"` to `spkg-install`. Then the above file compiles correctly, but the final stage of the compilation (to produce `libfplll.dll.a`) hangs forever.

By the way, there are also a bug with building ECL on Cygwin 2.8.0 (the latest version).  I haven't made a ticket for that yet but basically we need to add `-D_GNU_SOURCE` manually when compiling ECL (as a workaround).
