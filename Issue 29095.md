# Issue 29095: Loops in graphs

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29332

Original creator: @Shlokatadistance

So the graph feature of [SageMath](SageMath) is very comprehensive and supports a wide variety of functions. However, in directed graphs I propose that the functions of loops be added , or atleast `allow_loops` be modified, because sometimes the code is not able to detect graph loops completely, for example, a graph with 4 vertices can be shaped in the form of a square, which can be a loop, however Sagemath returned `False` when allows_loop() was run

Please stop creating empty "suggestion tickets". If you have questions, please go to https://ask.sagemath.org or the sage-support mailing list

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

This ticket is invalid. It is clear from the original version of comment:1 that it is based on an misunderstanding of graph-theoretic terminology: 

* A "loop" is an edge `[v,v]` from a vertex to itself.
* A sequence of edges that returns to the starting point is a "cycle", not a loop.
