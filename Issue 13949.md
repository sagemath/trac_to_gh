I just tried this patch on the suspicion it could help with the test weirdness I reported in 5.9.beta0 on sage-release

The R error was fixed by unsetting R_HOME before running the test. Then I applied the patch and here is the result

I have repaired a detail, but this is not working, in several distinct ways.

This seems to be broken on lines having unicode characters in comments such as:

```
sage: 0 + 0    # c'est trop bête
```


Some doctests come from the notebook, I made a pull request.

A failing doctest in src/sage/misc/rest_index_of_methods.py
is related to the presence of "Lov\xc3\xa1sz theta"

Regarding this commit, and others like it--is this not going to be a problem on Python 3, where the strings won't be repr'd as `u'...'`?

In other projects I've modified the doctest checker to ignore the `u` marker in strings by default.  If a test needs to explicitly check whether or not a string is unicode there are other ways.  But most of the time that isn't relevant.

Maybe we should force the value of `"GAPInfo.TermEncoding"` ?

see https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/pkg/GAPDoc-1.5.1/doc/chap5.html

Maybe using `GAPInfo.TermEncoding := "UTF-8";`

I know nothing of GAP, some input from a GAP expert could be useful here..
