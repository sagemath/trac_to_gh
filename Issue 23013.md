# Issue 23013: $(PYTHON) should be a dependency of Singular

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Sometimes when doing a parallel build on Cygwin, the Singular build will fail if it tries to build the "pyobject" module before Python itself has finished building.

Because all symbols must be resolved at link time when building shared modules on Windows, this will fail on Windows but not on other platforms (especially if they already happen to have the Python headers on their system which most Sage developers will).

AFAICT this doesn't cause any problems.

I wasn't aware that Singular had a Python module. But apparently, it does, so it should be a dependency.

I was aware it existed. As far as I remember it is only python2 and I thought it was disabled by default. If I remember correctly it allows you to make python calls from singular.

Ah, I see.  I wasn't exactly sure what it was for either and figured that Sage must use it _somehow_ but I guess not.  I was definitely aware it existed because I need to make some tweaks to it when I was fixing Singular's build system to work on Cygwin.
