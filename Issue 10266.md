Add method for finite word that returns the balance of self. 

The balance of a word is the smallest number `q` such that self is `q`-balanced.


```
sage: w = Word('11112222')
sage: w.is_balanced(2)
False
sage: w.is_balanced(3)
False
sage: w.is_balanced(4)
True
sage: w.is_balanced(5)
True
sage: w.balance()
4
```

I just finished testing the ticket... Short and sweet, there's nothing to say. All tests passed, Sphinx generated clean documentation, the code is easy to understand, the name is clear and the references are sound. Positive review.
