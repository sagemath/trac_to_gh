Same applies to `asin`. Compare with:

```
sage: asec(0)
NaN
sage: type(asec(0))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
sage: type(asec(0).pyobject())

with a custom function this happens:


```
sage: f = piecewise([((-1,0), 1), ([0,1], -1)], var=x)
sage: f(2)
...
ValueError: point 2 is not in the domain
```


to say that the result here is more informative than NaN, although i suppose that the notion of domain is a feature not implemented for symbolic functions?..

We're far away from that unfortunately.

Whoah.  Are you then saying we also shouldn't allow `log(-1)`?  After all:


```
sage: acos(CC(2))
1.31695789692482*I
```


I'm not cool with all of a sudden assuming symbolic things couldn't be complex, unless we are very consistent about this everywhere, and I suspect this would break a lot of stuff.    Your example with arc secant is a red herring, because



```
sage: asec(CC(0))
NaN
```


At the very least this sort of thing should be discussed on sage-devel, in my view.
