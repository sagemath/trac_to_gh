As reported on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/rXZeGZjAIdU):


```
sage: hr = (x^2 + 2*x + 1)
sage: hl = (x + 1)^2
sage: a = hl != hr
sage: bool(a)
True 
```


Note that


```
sage: bool(a.expand())
False
```


This is due to the fact that there is a call to `is_trivial_zero` instead
of `is_zero` somewhere in the `__bool__` method for symbolic expressions. 

The fix provided by this ticket is not intented to fix other existing `boo(expr1 != expr2)` issues (e.g. #33698).
