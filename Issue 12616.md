It was observed in
[this sage-support thread](http://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-support/OEHb5aIjBIQ/discussion) that Python new-style format specifiers for Sage Integers don't work. The solution is easy: Equip Integer with a `__format__` method that simply converts the Sage Integer to a Python int and then calls the `__format__` method on that. Given that converting a GMP int to a Python int should be much cheaper than converting either to a string, I don't expect much of a performance penalty, and implementing the whole Format mini-language again seems a waste of effort.
