Needs rebasing again.

Also when I did `raise SomeError('An error occurred.')` I got a comment that it should be `raise SomeError('an error occurred')`. (Which seems stupid to my eyes, but is in some PEP.)

Done.

I do not see the point of that either. I hope that your reviewer will not stop here then `:-p`

This is free for Somebody Other(tm) to review... I will add my name to reviewers-field if I make significant progress with reading this.

Well, was not that hard.

Assuming other parts work, this seems to be direct (and correct) translation of equations from the paper to the code. I read it, and tested with examples given in the paper. I think that `l` as a variable name makes sense here, because `lambda` is already reserved name (and we do not use Fortress language `:=)`), even if it violates PEP 0008 part "Names to Avoid". Hence I mark this as positive review.

Btw, `graphs.strongly_regular_graph(324,57,0,12)` says "- - graph exists.Comments: - -", i.e. has a missing space. You may want to correct it, when next time modifying this file.

yeah, `lambda` as a variable name might get you confused...

PS. The tests in the reference are hardly new, I changed wording there.

Thanks for the review!
