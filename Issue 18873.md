```
sage: ZZ(0)^(-1)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Rational division by zero
```

vs.

```
sage: QQ(0)^(-1)
...
FloatingPointError: Floating point exception
```

which is inconsistent (the latter should also raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

FYI, `1/ZZ(0)` and `1/QQ(0)` both raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

I think "Sage crashes" is much closer to the reality than what you think.

Essentially, Sage does crash but the signal handling framework handles this crash and turns it into an exception.
