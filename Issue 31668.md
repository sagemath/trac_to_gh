I was able to successfully build Sage on M1 (see #30592) but had two main types of doctest errors.

This apparently requires a change in the setup.py (see [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/6LldEeJu3ZA/m/HXp3lFwCCgAJ)):

to allow `/opt/homebrew`.

These defaults in cvxopt's setup.py can be overridden using environment variables
`CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_INC_DIR`, `CVXOPT_SUITESPARSE_LIB_DIR`.
We already set these variables when we build our own `suitesparse` (then `SAGE_SUITESPARSE_PREFIX` is nonempty). 

On macOS, we could just set these variables also (to something arbitrary) when system suitesparse is in use.

See also #33083#comment:40 - a related issue on `alpine`.

can one build Sage's `suitsparse` on M2, and use it to build `cvxopt`?
If so, we can close it.

I can build successfully using Sage's `suitesparse` and also homebrew's `suitesparse`, so setting to positive review.
