I already did several tests, but more tests are certainly needed.

I set this ticket to needs review, but before finalizing it, I plan to clean the entire file (PEP8). So let me know if you agree or not with proposed change.

Yep, this is fine with me (I'm not worried about speed in plotting, but for other tickets, I would not want to move the `is_directed()` calls into the `for` loop).

I cleaned the file (and moved the `is_directed` outside the for loop).

While we are bring things up to standard:

`Returns` -> `Return` and `Sets` -> `Set`.

```diff
         - ``orientation`` -- whether to place the root at the top or at the
-          bottom :
+          bottom:
 
-            - ``orientation="down"`` -- children are placed below their parent
-            - ``orientation="top"`` -- children are placed above their parent
+          * ``orientation="down"`` -- children are placed below their parent
+          * ``orientation="top"`` -- children are placed above their parent
```

Everything else is okay.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
