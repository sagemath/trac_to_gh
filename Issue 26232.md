While we are bring things up to standard:

`Returns` -> `Return` and `Sets` -> `Set`.

```diff
         - ``orientation`` -- whether to place the root at the top or at the
-          bottom :
+          bottom:
 
-            - ``orientation="down"`` -- children are placed below their parent

+          * ``orientation="down"`` -- children are placed below their parent
+          * ``orientation="top"`` -- children are placed above their parent
```

Everything else is okay.
