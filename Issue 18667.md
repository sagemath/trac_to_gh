CC:  @vbraun @jdemeyer @dcoudert

With this branch, the default value of `--optional` in `sage -t` is larger than the list of installed new-style optional packages.

In particular, `cplex` and `gurobi` (which are not optional packages as they are proprietary) are added to the list (some tests are too slow to be run with glpk, e.g. #18871).

More can be added to that list. If you know a better way to implement it, I am all ears.

Are we sure that we actually *want* to do this? We have no control over those external packages. What if somebody has `magma` but with a version that is not fully compatible with Sage? With Sage's optional packages, that issue does not occur since we have full control over those packages.

A few comments on the code:
1. Never use `except:`. Use `except Exception:` or some other specific exception class.
2. Code structure: can we please move all this detect-optional-packages code to a separate function?
3. Performance: how much time does it take to run all those tests? Note that #13540 has a system for "lazy" checking of optional dependencies: the check for a given package is only done if we are actually running a test involving that package.

> Are we sure that we actually *want* to do this?

If you oppose the changes involving `Maple/Matlab` and others then I do not mind removing them for you. We can keep Gurobi and CPLEX for they are only used by Sage if the user explicitly linked them with it.

> 1. Never use `except:`. Use `except Exception:` or some other specific exception class.

I thought that here it was pretty safe: I do not want this test to ever break, and if there is something wrong with the mathematica/maple/... interface, then other doctests will have to report it.

> 2. Code structure: can we please move all this detect-optional-packages code to a separate function?

I will add a commit.

> 3. Performance: how much time does it take to run all those tests?

Almost nothing, give it a try. That's clearly negligible against the time it takes to run the `sage -b` part of `sage -btp`.

> Note that #13540 has a system for "lazy" checking of optional dependencies

I do not see a need for that given the time it takes to run those tests. Especially, if you want the maple/matlab/others to be removed from the list.

I rewrote this branch by moving everything to a new function, and added a 'Exception'. In this commit all `Maple/Matlab/others` are tested for I believe that we should test them.

If you object to that and are interested in other's opinion about it (on top of mine), perhaps you should write to sage-devel in the same thread or in a new one. If you oppose it, add a commit to remove the lines (I am tired of fighting endlessly). 

I am waiting for your answer to [comment:21] to simplify a couple of lines in the code.

> how about making this ticket depend on #18908 and include mathematica in the list?

Given that Jeroen seems to doubts the wisdom of testing mathematica/maple/..., it seems a bit early to do that. Also, there is nothing inherently wrong in having #18908 add a couple of lines to `control.py` if this ticket is merged first.

And that's the only way for us to learn in how many ways such installs can be broken, and act upon it by fixing our interfaces.

Besides, in the case where you really don't have those external softwares installed, checking whether they can be run should be as fast as detecting that the executable cannot be found. So we can also improve that, if we find it too slow.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle

Is the doctest controller responsible for third-party interfaces?

E.g. page 34 of http://vitoex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Read/Clean%20Code.pdf recommends:

"The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that
they should be smaller than that. [...] Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long."

The other good news for me is that I do not see anything about creating a new file for functions of 20< x < 30 lines.

So it's still up for review.

I have no problem figuring this out. There is a place in the doctest code where we define the default list of optional packages that we should test. It is done in the `DoctestController` class defined in `doctest.py`, and I don't see a better place to write the code that builds this list.
