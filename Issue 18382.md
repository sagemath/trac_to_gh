in the procedure _vector_decomposition, the line

        psetvect = VectorSpace(GF(2), num_cols).list()

it is not possible to simply append a zero to a vector since vectors have a fixed dimension.

The best way to proceed is

1) to add "from six.moves import range" in the imports at the beginning of the file

2) to use only range (which is an iterator because of (1) and should be wrapped with list(..) when necessary)

This is only for .py files. xrange is ok in .pyx files
