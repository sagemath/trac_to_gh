the names of the function should be more explicit (less abbreviated)

and the code would also need a clean-up, I think

Tried to pull this ticket and got a syntax error when I built Sage:

in the procedure _vector_decomposition, the line

"ap[i]- = 1"

appears.  Should this be "ap[i] = 1" or "ap[i] -= 1"?

It should be  "ap[i] -= 1". Thanks.

Added the lines

+        from sage.modules.free_module import VectorSpace

+        from sage.rings.finite_rings.finite_field_constructor import GF

but still getting an error because in

        # For each vector a in vd. check if a vector s in {0,1}^n is compatible.

        compatibleList = []

        psetvect = VectorSpace(GF(2), num_cols).list()

        for p in psetvect:

            while len(p) < len(vd[0][0]):

                p.append(0)

it is not possible to simply append a zero to a vector since vectors have a fixed dimension.

do not use xrange, for compatibility with python3, please

Frederic, to help out a new sage developer from the recent Sage Days, should Li change the use of 'xrange' to 'range' or 'list(range)' depending on the use case, or is there a significant change that needs to be made to xrange?

Thanks,
Gregg

The best way to proceed is

1) to add "from six.moves import range" in the imports at the beginning of the file

2) to use only range (which is an iterator because of (1) and should be wrapped with list(..) when necessary)

This is only for .py files. xrange is ok in .pyx files
