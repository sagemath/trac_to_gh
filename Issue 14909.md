Keywords: sage-location doctest

The current sage-location check does not work in case a package gets fixed (#15100), or not installed at all.

Better use `sysconfdir` (=`$SAGE_ETC`) for sage-current-location.txt and check whether it has been created properly.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15146
