# Issue 14909: check whether sage-location has been executed

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: felixs

Original creation time: 2013-09-03 10:27:36

CC:  dimpase chapoton jhpalmieri

Keywords: sage-location doctest

The current sage-location check does not work in case a package gets fixed (#15100), or not installed at all.

Better use `sysconfdir` (=`$SAGE_ETC`) for sage-current-location.txt and check whether it has been created properly.

Aren't you missing a 'lib' in the call to os.path.join ?

Is this ticket ready for review?

Shouldn't you remove the ipython test you complained about in #15100?
