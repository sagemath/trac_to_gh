Keywords: limit

Seemingly erroneous handling of the different nicknames that the keyword `dir` (direction) the limit function can have. For example,


```
sage: (1/(x-3)).limit(x=3, dir='below', algorithm='maxima')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'l' referenced before assignment
```


but breaks for no apparent reason, since:


```
sage: (1/(x-3)).limit(x=3, dir='below', algorithm='maxima_taylor')
-Infinity
```


works.
