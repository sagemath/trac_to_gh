Currently, this does not work:

```
sage: X = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[2,1])
sage: Y = crystals.Tableaux(['A',2], shape=[3,1])
sage: tensor([X.highest_weight_vector(), Y.highest_weight_vector()])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/travis/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/categories/covariant_functorial_construction.pyc in __call__(self, args, **kwargs)
    219         """
    220         args = tuple(args) # a bit brute force; let's see if this becomes a bottleneck later
--> 221         assert(all( hasattr(arg, self._functor_name) for arg in args))
    222         assert(len(args) > 0)
    223         return getattr(args[0], self._functor_name)(*args[1:], **kwargs)

AssertionError:
```

but it should be implemented.
