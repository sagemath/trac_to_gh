Corner sum matrix method on AlternatingSignMatrix has incorrect output:

See the following example:

a = AlternatingSignMatrix([

[0,0,1],

[1,0,0],

[0,1,0]])


```
a.corner_sum_matrix()
```


```
{{{
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 1 1]
[0 0 1 2]
[0 1 2 3]


}}}
The result should be: (the transpose of what is displayed). 
See the definition in Section 2 of !http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0208125. 


{{{
[0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 1]
[0 1 1 2]
[0 1 2 3]
}}}
Also, the documentation has this example, which is wrong and should be changed.
```
