As the subject says. This is a follow-up to #10201. From [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d83f8d87962f8a9f/), William Stein announced this blog entry:

http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-referee-sage-trac-tickets.html

It would be a shame if new developers of Sage could not easily find it.
