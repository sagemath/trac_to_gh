Should I delete the 12697 patch?

Also the patch you uploaded is directly out of an hg server and was not properly exported. Is it a problem for Jeroen ?

It's probably better if it were exported.  I would wait to get this reviewed and then worry about it if you're still not able to upload the patch to this ticket.

For the record, I went through the patch, and it looks good. But I haven't double checked the code changes to the html class, nor recompiled the documentation or run the tests.

No Idea ! I tried to upload some other patch without problem but on this one the trac server seems to hang. It happens with Firefox, Opera and Konqueror. So this shouldn't be a problem related to the browser.

It's not a proper HG exported patch, that's probably why Trac refuses it.  Create your patch with `hg export` and try uploading it again.

No this is not the problem: as I said on sage-devel the exported patch is at

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/wstein/www/home/hivert/trac_12717-latex_builtin_constants-fh.patch

I can't manage to get it on trac.

There is something wrong with that file.  Try to figure out what.

Thanks for the fix. Concerning the title, it was cut automatically by trac (or so it seems to me). Did something change on trac's config ?
