No Idea ! I tried to upload some other patch without problem but on this one the trac server seems to hang. It happens with Firefox, Opera and Konqueror. So this shouldn't be a problem related to the browser.

It's not a proper HG exported patch, that's probably why Trac refuses it.  Create your patch with `hg export` and try uploading it again.
