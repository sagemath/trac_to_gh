Keywords: GAP packages, semigroups

[libsemigroups](https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/) is a C++ library for computing in semigroups, and is used by semigroups GAP package, which is to be included in Sage, cf. #27295

So this automatically gives it rights to become an optional package.

It installed and package tests were okay for me (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). However, I think this is mostly useless package for Sage without the Python bindings (or GAP's semigroups package). So I think we should add the Python bindings as part of this ticket too.

I don't quite understand the point you are trying to make here. This ticket is a dependency of #27295, which is for exactly this, adding  GAP's semigroups package.

No, not here. Adding python bindings should be on another ticket.

This does not make sense to me as a standalone (at least, it seems like the Cython code would be complicated to generated examples, but maybe I didn't look closely enough). Based on that, I feel either this should be as part of #27295 or have the Python bindings added to this ticket.
