# Issue 27159: add libsemigroups package

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27396

Original creator: dimpase

Original creation time: 2019-03-02 08:18:02

CC:  nthiery isuruf

Keywords: GAP packages, semigroups

[libsemigroups](https://james-d-mitchell.github.io/libsemigroups/) is a C++ library for computing in semigroups, and is used by semigroups GAP package, which is to be included in Sage, cf. #27295

So this automatically gives it rights to become an optional package.

tarball: https://github.com/james-d-mitchell/libsemigroups/releases/download/v0.6.4/libsemigroups-0.6.4.tar.gz

Ready for review. On another ticket we should also add its Python bindings:

It installed and package tests were okay for me (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). However, I think this is mostly useless package for Sage without the Python bindings (or GAP's semigroups package). So I think we should add the Python bindings as part of this ticket too.

I don't quite understand the point you are trying to make here. This ticket is a dependency of #27295, which is for exactly this, adding  GAP's semigroups package.

No, not here. Adding python bindings should be on another ticket.

This does not make sense to me as a standalone (at least, it seems like the Cython code would be complicated to generated examples, but maybe I didn't look closely enough). Based on that, I feel either this should be as part of #27295 or have the Python bindings added to this ticket.

Now it is a part of #27295.

A ticket should not be trying to do too much, and get too hard to review due to this.


---

Comment by tscrim created at 2019-03-06 08:35:43

I agree, but I also think tickets also should have some standalone meaning. Different commits can help granularize changes similar to splitting tickets. I just don't think this quite passes the standalone test.

We have added standalone C++ libraries without any bindings and a clear plan why they are needed in the past, cf e.g. mprfcx.
This one is much better in this respect.

Different projects have different commits per ticket policies. We don't have any, and I seldom see people reviewing tickets per commit, either.

I am not one to generally follow something I do not agree with just because there is prescient. I am only setting a positive review here under the condition that this is merged with #27295, but I feel it would be better for this to be included as part of #27295.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

Updated link in the description to the current source code home of libsemigroups.

Oops, pasted the wrong link.

just a version bump and a rebase over the latest GAP


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2019-07-04 15:13:52

this needs a modified tarball, as the ones available do not come with `./confugure`, one needs autotools to get one.

I've linked the correct tarball, with ready `./configure`. One needs to untar the original upstream tarball, which is bare, run `./autogen` there (having autotools installed), and re-tar.

Could you also review #27295 (this is adding GAP interface to this library, whjch was the original purpose of this ticket all along)

Resolution: fixed
