Sorry Volker - was in a rush to get a functioning server up and embarrassingly forgot about tests that used to have real LaTeX rather than something that MathJax likes... New commit is long, but mostly LaTeX changes to doctests and documentation - a few touches to the code remove {}-wrapping of stuff after `\color` commands.
