I think these qualify for # long time. This will help on older machines where this file occasionally hits the default (non --long) timeout of 300s.

Replying to [comment:3 dcoudert]:

Technically it doesn't matter but I'm happy to add an extra space if you think it looks better.

Frédéric knows better than me the rules. If he says it's ok like that, then it's fine. Thanks.

in doctests, could be nicer but not required. This is suggested by pep8 for comments in the code
