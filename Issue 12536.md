# Issue 12536: limit not correctly computed by maxima

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12708

Original creator: ppurka

Original creation time: 2012-03-20 16:47:34

Assignee: burcin

Keywords: maxima limit

This is taken from the google notebook bug report page.

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0)            
x
```

On the other hand, this works

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0,taylor=True)            
0
```

It is a bug in Maxima, and is still present in sage-5.0beta8. This beta apparently has maxima-5.26, the latest released version of Maxima.

Ah, ppurka, you already reported upstream... in the meantime I had already created one.  I closed the duplicate, I guess we were both working on this at the same time.  Sorry.

Maxima 5.28 is now out.

This should be fixed by #13364.

Works for me. It has been merged in 5.7.

But it needs a patch to _verify_ that is has been fixed and doesn't regress.

Apply to devel/sage

This should be doctested in maxima, IMHO :/

Usually they do in fact add tests for bug fixes.  Nonetheless, Sage has a long history of adding redundancy.  For instance, if we for some reason switched to sympy or native limits, we would still want this to work.  Or if somehow Maxima _didn't_ test for exactly the same thing, we would notice if a very similar version worked but this failed.

I agree. Even if the doctest is redundant, better test twice than not at all.
