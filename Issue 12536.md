Assignee: burcin

Keywords: maxima limit

This is taken from the google notebook bug report page.

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0)            
x
```

On the other hand, this works

```
sage: limit(tanh(x),x=0,taylor=True)            
0
```

It is a bug in Maxima, and is still present in sage-5.0beta8. This beta apparently has maxima-5.26, the latest released version of Maxima.

Usually they do in fact add tests for bug fixes.  Nonetheless, Sage has a long history of adding redundancy.  For instance, if we for some reason switched to sympy or native limits, we would still want this to work.
