Needs work, due to #11747 -- ambiguity of is_monomial.

Rebased on 6.2.beta8. I changed the implementation of `LaurentPolynomial.is_monomial` because it gave the wrong (in the sense of #11747) result. It would also have marked zero as a monomial which would be wrong IMHO, and not according to `Polynomial.is_monomial`. I also changed the documentation to fit #11747. I removed the words `non-negative` from the doc of the `laurent_polynomial.pyx` implementation. I finally fixed appearances of "Returns".
