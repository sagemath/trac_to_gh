Would be nice if something like this could be made to work out of the box, unsure as to difficulty


```
sage: D = DirichletGroup(13)
....: c = D.Element(D,vector([2]))
....: N = Newforms(c,2,names="a")
....: f = N[0]
sage: f.hecke_eigenvalue_field().galois_group().gen()
(1,2)
sage: sigma = f.hecke_eigenvalue_field().galois_group().gen()
sage: sigma(f)

The mathematical difficulty is virtually nil; the problem is one of designing a consistent interface. 

The problem is that Sage's "newforms" were originally intended to represent simple (**not** absolutely simple!) factors of the new part of the Hecke algebra over Q, or Q(chi) where chi is the character. So the Galois action is by definition trivial, at least if chi is Q-valued. 

Some of the more recent functionality, e.g. L-functions and Atkin--Lehner eigenvalues, blurs these distinctions by choosing -- or allowing the user to choose -- embeddings into C and then computing things that really depend on that embedding; but this is done in a rather inconsistent ad-hoc way, and this has led to some genuine bugs e.g. #18672.

If we were re-designing Sage from scratch, I'd be in favour of changing the `Newform` class, and the `Newforms(N, k, chi)` constructor function, so a Newform always comes with a specified embedding into C, and `Newforms` returns all newforms, not just one from every Galois orbit. This is how Magma behaves. However, making Sage do this would be a huge backward-incompatible change, breaking virtually every piece of code that uses Sage modular forms, so I don't know if it'd be a good idea to make the change now.

(Your example is actually a bit misleading because the coefficient field of your form is the same as the coefficient field of its character, which *does* come with a specified embedding into C, so the Sage object "f" represents a uniquely determined element of `C[This is the Trac macro *q* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#q-macro)` and sigma(f) is well-defined. But this is a pretty unusual case.)
