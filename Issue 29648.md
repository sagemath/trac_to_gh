# Issue 29648: Remove sagenb from "sage --notebook"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29885

Original creator: jhpalmieri

- Remove `sagenb` as a documented argument to the `sage-notebook` script, and remove the code to start the SageNB server.
- Rewrite the error when `sagenb` is passed as an argument.
- Change the default from `SageNBExport` to `NotebookJupyter`.

I am okay with this.  I would just add something like the last line here:

```
        print('See https://wiki.sagemath.org/Python3-Switch')
        print('Use sage --notebook=export to export sagenb notebooks to Jupyter')
```

By the way, see #17590 and possibly elsewhere.  But since 9.2 will (apparently) not support Py2, perhaps it's indeed better to simply remove sagenb than to keep it as an optional package that can't be launched from the command line.

Here is an expansion of the "sage -n sagenb" error message.

Thanks.  The code looks good, someone who can test the branch should just confirm that this works, and that tests pass - I can imagine some stray doctest somewhere needing the class?
