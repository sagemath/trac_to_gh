Ah!  Maybe we can also use this to test other scripts of this nature... see #17377.

Just a comment (I don't have time immediately to try this): What of `sage --rst2txt` - is that eventually a new way?  I think that is now supported, anyway, maybe should put that instead for consistency's sake (not that I care, I know others do).

The new tests seem to be reasonable. Doctests pass. The `.sws` file generated in the test can be imported into the sage worksheet, so it seems to be ok. I manually checked `./sage -docbuild file=src/sage/tests/cmdline.py html` to check that no new `ReSt` errors are introduced by this ticket (the list at the top is rendered messily, but that's not this ticket's fault).

For me, this is a positive review. I do not yet press the button in order to give Karl-Dieter or others still a possibility to comment.
