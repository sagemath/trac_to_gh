When reading a question on ask.sagemath I realized that %hide doesn't work properly when printing.  This is the same bug as #5718 which was fixed 2 years ago.

Can you try this in vanilla Sage 4.7.1, Ivan?   Just in case it happened during the migration to flask, it would be good to identify that.

The same problem occurs on my local install of 4.7.1 which doesn't use flask.

As a reference, [hide_code](https://github.com/kirbs-/hide_code) jupyter extension allows to hide cells in the jupyter noteboook. See [this question on ask](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/50277/how-to-install-hide_code-in-sagemath/) for installation, because `hide_code` currently depends on an older version of `prompt_toolkit`.
