Error building Sage. 

The following package(s) may have failed to build: 

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially 
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build 
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable 
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this. 
```

* looks like a dependency problem since we now build docs in parallel
* also, failure to report where in the build the error is in

Together with #18808 I can now `make doc` without building Sage first, so it seems that dependencies are correct now.

There is no reason to make this depend on #18748 and #18788.

You wanted the reorganization in #18788 and I don't see a point in making a conflicting ticket.

Replying to [comment:4 vbraun]:
> You wanted the reorganization in #18788 and I don't see a point in making a conflicting ticket. 
First of all, I didn't ask for #18788. Second, it doesn't conflict (I can cherry-pick your last commit on this ticket without a conflict).

You specifically asked for moving stuff around in /build: http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18748#comment:25

Let's not make this more complicated than it needs to be. Positive review to your last commit (cherry-picked on top of 6.8.beta7).
