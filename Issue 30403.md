  [dochtml]   Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
  [dochtml]   This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
  [dochtml]   in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
  [dochtml]   Python will now terminate.

Sage 9.3 and Sage 9.4.rc2 both build
for me on Cygwin, including doc-html.

And in any case this was most likely related to the numpy architecture issue.
