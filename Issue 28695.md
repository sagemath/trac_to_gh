# Issue 28695: fix QuadraticField constructor if embedding=False

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28932

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2020-01-01 11:46:05

The `QuadraticField` constructor takes a boolean argument `embedding`, according to its documentation:


```
    -  ``embedding`` - bool or square root of D in an
       ambient field (default: True)
```


but `embedding=False` raises an error, which is fixed by this ticket:


```
sage: QuadraticField(3, embedding=False)
...
AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'parent'
```
