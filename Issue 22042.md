with Sage 7.3 and the following code:

```
def FindGroupOrder(p,s):
   K = GF(p)
   v = K(4*s)
   u = K(s^2-5)
   x = u^3
   b = 4*x*v
   a = (v-u)^3*(3*u+v)
   A = a/b-2
   x = x/v^3
   b = x^3 + A*x^2 + x
   E = EllipticCurve(K,[0,b*A,0,b^2,0])
   return factor(E.cardinality())

p = 5124287448739202795545639
sigma = 5
ming2 = infinity
while True:
   sigma += 1
   l = FindGroupOrder(p, sigma)
   if len(l) >= 2:
      g2 = l[-2][0]
      if g2 >= 2977044737 and g2 < ming2:
         print "sigma=", sigma, l
         ming2 = g2
```

I get:

```
sigma= 23 2^3 * 3^3 * 83 * 11664842257 * 24503198029
sigma= 187 2^4 * 3 * 5 * 23 * 4569906967 * 203136070453
sigma= 281 2^2 * 3^2 * 17 * 4553084269 * 1838977320077
sigma= 358 2^6 * 3^5 * 3696957041 * 89125674997
sigma= 486 2^7 * 3 * 127 * 3366759491 * 31209473717
sigma= 588 2^6 * 3^3 * 5 * 7 * 3010007183 * 28148429509
sigma= 2643 2^4 * 3 * 5 * 11 * 2988513007 * 649492897793
sigma= 5910 2^3 * 3 * 5 * 47 * 2979655039 * 304921741777

My machine runs out of memory before I get an error.

Please fill in the `...`, the traceback is very useful to find out where the problem lies.

PARI just announced they are preparing a PARI 2.9.2 (see #22675) release and this is in their changelog:

```
19- ellsea could leak variables (=> "no more variables" error)       [F30]
```

I guess this is exactly this issue.

Jeroen, why did you close that ticket? Did you check it was fixed with PARI 2.9.2?
