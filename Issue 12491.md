# Issue 12491: Partitions(-1).list() goes intto infinte recursion

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12663

Original creator: mantepse

Original creation time: 2012-03-13 13:08:50

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  sdenton

Keywords: Partitions, corner case

Currently Partitions only checks whether its argument is an integer, but iterating through Partitions(-1) fails.  The question is whether we want to accept only nonnegative integers or to return the empty list.  (I vote for the empty list)

The commit message of this patch should be changed (using `hg qrefresh -e` for example):
 1. The "[mq] ..." should not be there.
 2. It's better not to have one long line, line wrapping is recommended.  But make sure the first line (displayed by `hg log`) makes sense just by itself.
