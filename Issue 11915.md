Can you explain why some files are listed in `.hgignore` but are part of the distribution?  For example, "PKG-INFO" (autogenerated somehow?), "pull", and "sage/rings/integer.h"?  What about the 4.5 megabyte file `sage/c_lib/.sconsign.dblite`?

That sounds plausible; however, I would rather track all of these files and do more processing in `sage-test-new` â€” only test the file if its suffix is something appropriate.  (This obviously would belong on another ticket.)

`pull` is no longer in `.hgignore` with my patch.

The `.h` files are auto-generated by Cython and should not be in the MANIFEST.

I have no idea about `.sconsign.dblite`
