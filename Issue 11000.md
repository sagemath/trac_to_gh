We're missing some conversions from Maxima.  Like exponential integrals of various kinds.

```
sage: f(x) = e^(-x) * log(x+1)
sage: uu = integral(f,x,0,oo)
sage: uu
x |--> e*expintegral_e(1, 1)

As far as I can tell, the general `exponential_e` function isn't available directly in Sage or in PARI (which is used to evaluate the `exponential_integral_1` function in Sage). 

Also, it's possible to get maxima to rewrite the exponential integrals in terms of gamma functions like so: 

```python
sage: maxima.eval('expintrep:gamma_incomplete')
'gamma_incomplete'
sage: maxima.integrate(exp(-x)*log(x+1), x, 0, oo)
%e*gamma_incomplete(0,1)
sage: N(e*gamma(0,1), digits=18)
0.596347362323194074
```


But as you see, `gamma_incomplete` isn't defined in Sage either, but the table `sage.symbolic.pynac.symbol_table['maxima']` lists the Sage equivalent `gamma`. Anyway, it should be possible to have the maxima interface (with the help of maxima itself) rewrite any exponential integral that Sage doesn't have in terms of gamma functions. 

By the way, the owner on the ticket is `@`burcin, does that mean they are working on it currently?

Interesting.

That should be ok; the whole point of the table is to convert into the Sage equivalent.

No, that is an automatic thing that happens.  It is possible to be designated an 'owner' of a ticket in a given component, which basically means you automatically get updates.

I guess the point of this ticket is to define symbolic function in Sage to represent exponential integrals, etc. The symbolic function class handles adding stuff to the conversion table automatically.

Can we replace this ticket with several beginner tickets? One for each function we are missing.

I'm attempting to write a template for the `expintegral_e` function (denoted E_n(z) in A&S). As I'm looking through the code, I see several models used for the functions and classes in `sage/functions/special.py` and `sage/functions/transcendental.py`

* Functions like `Function_exp_integral` (also called `Ei`) are defined as classes that inherit from `BuiltInFunction` and call the mpmath implementation when evaluated. The function `DickmanRho` also does this and includes other nice methods for approximating values and power series.
* Functions like `EllipticE` inherit from `MaximaFunction` which handles evaluation, etc. through Maxima. It seems there is an advantage to the mpmath implementation because presumably the interface is faster and the precision is arbitrary (whereas Maxima is limited to 53 bits).
* Functions like `Li` and `error_fcn` are simply wrapper functions that try to evaluate the input symbolically or numerically depending on context.
* In `sage/functions/trig.py` there is a mixture of classes that derive from `GinacFunction` (and include information in their `__init__` methods about conversions to other systems like Maxima or Mathematica) and also functions that derive from `BuiltinFunction`. It's not clear to me why some functions are Ginac and some are Builtin.

Questions: 

* For the purposes of this ticket, what is recommended? `@`kcrisman 's comment leads me to believe that inheriting from the `BuiltinFunction` class and using `mpmath` for evaluation is preferable. 
* Where should the various exponential integral special functions that we are missing go? `sage/functions/special.py`, `sage/functions/transcendental.py`, or somewhere else?

Those are good questions.  

I think the most important thing is to make sure that whatever is implemented has

* good numerical evaluation (perhaps via mpmath)
* translates back and forth to Maxima properly (for integration and limits)

My sense is that BuiltinFunction would be best.  GinacFunction probably is only good for things that in fact evaluate in Ginac.  This explains trig.py.  [This Ginac page](http://www.ginac.de/tutorial/Built_002din-functions.html) shows that the ones which are GinacFunctions are exactly the ones which Ginac in fact has.      I don't think it has most of these other functions.

As for MaximaFunction, it seems to inherit from BuiltinFunction and lives in the special functions file.  This dates from the days when Sage had very few options for symbolic stuff and evaluation, and so it just does a few extra things.  If we moved to mpmath for a given function, we would probably use BuiltinFunction and then add evaluation options for Maxima and add to the conversion dictionary as needed.  

In fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea to have two different eval procedures if possible...

As for where such things go, probably it would make sense to separate a lot of these special functions out into a separate file.  The distinction between transcendental and special is not totally obvious, for instance :)

By the way, we certainly want fewer of the wrapper functions!  But that will take a lot of tedious work.

* See [_eval_ method of sage.functions.other.Function_gamma_inc](http://hg.sagemath.org/sage-main/file/tip/sage/functions/other.py#l680) for an example of how to find a common parent for the arguments
* The call to mpmath does not require the prec parameter any more. If you pass a Sage element to mpmath it handles the precision correctly. You can delete the code for this in `_evalf_()`.
* You should remove the `__call__()` method altogether. The only purpose of that is to display the deprecation notice. Since you are implementing a new function here, there is nothing being deprecated.
* In `_derivative_()` the call to this function should be `exp_integral_e(n-1, z)`, assuming you change the function name accordingly.

I changed the ticket description to limit this to implementing symbolic functions for exponential integrals. We can use [the wiki page](symbolics-functions) for a general overview of the progress on symbolic functions.

The tests similar to `if z == 0` in `_eval_` do make a big difference. I guess this is well known, but I didn't realize how big the speed difference is. 

I made a little table below of some timings. In the first table , `_eval_` includes tests `if z == 0 and n > 1` and `if n == 0`. In the second table, there are no such if statements (so the special cases are not implemented). In the third table, the special cases are implementes as in `sage/functions/generalized.py` where an approximation of `z` (or `n`) is produced and checked instead of the symbol.

Timings in tables 2 and 3 are close except in the case where ``exp(-z)/z`` is
returned, whereas table 1 is anywhere from a factor of 3 to 5 slower than in table 2 when a symbolic argument is passed. Anyway, I thought I'd include the above for other beginners such as myself.

--------------

Another thing I discovered is that these two special cases that I was
implementing are known to Maxima:


```
sage: f = exp_integral_e(0,x)
sage: f
exp_integral_e(0,x)
sage: f.simplify()
e^(-x)/x

sage: nn = var('nn')
sage: assume(nn > 1)
sage: f = exp_integral_e(nn, 0)
sage: f
exp_integral_e(nn, 0)
sage: f.simplify()
1/(nn - 1)
```

	
So I think in the interest of speedy evaluation it's best to leave the special
cases out, but point out in the documentation that Maxima knows about them.

I've uploaded a new patch. I'll start implementing the other exponential integrals using this as a template.

I think your timings show that using the CIF approximation is not such a big penalty. Note that your timings also reflect the construction of the result and not just including that change. It is better if Sage can do the evaluation automatically without having to pass through a `simplify()` call. I'd like them in, with the approximation approach.

Since this approximation is being called so often, we should make it a method of symbolic expressions. I opened a new ticket for this: #11513. This ticket should depend on that.

I will provide a preliminary patch for #11513 soon.

I realized that in row 2 of the previous timings I neglected to assume n > 1 so those timings aren't giving much information since the expression is left unevaluated like in row 1. The new row 3 includes that assumption so that the simplified result ``1/(n-1)`` is created and returned. 

I'll update the timings above and move these tables to the wiki.

I've uploaded a new partial patch for the ticket. I wanted to post this now before I finish the patch so people can comment on the consolidation of exponential functions in the new file `sage/functions/exp_integral.py`  and/or anything else. 

If the basic organisation looks good, I'll finish up adding the remaining exponential integrals and upload a new patch.

Trying to finish up the patch, I've run into a problem evaluating any of my new functions at python floats. For example, apply the patch and try:


```

You also get the error if you try to plot any of the exponential integral functions as they are written unless you wrap the input with `RDF` or something similar.

The error is being raised inside the `call` function in `sage/libs/mpmath/util.pyx`. I've looked through that code and thought about what would happen if the `prec` option is not specified (as in my code) and the parent is `None` (as when a python float is passed), but I can't figure out why it doesn't work to pass a float.

On the other hand, changing the lines in the `_evalf` method


```
import mpmath
return mpmath_utils.call(mpmath.e1, z, parent=parent)
```


to 


```
import mpmath
if isinstance(parent, Parent) and hasattr(parent, 'prec'):
    prec = parent.prec()
else:
    prec = 53
return mpmath_utils.call(mpmath.si, z, prec=prec)
```


fixes the error. 

What do people think? Is this a bug in the `call` function (which claims it will accept any type that mpmath handles natively like python floats) or is there something wrong with my code?

It would be better to fix the `mpmath_call()` function. This is called from many places and duplicating the code to check if `parent` has a `prec()` method everywhere is error prone.

Hi guys. I don't know if this even applies, because I discovered this behaviour on version 4.8, with the patch applied (And it seems to apply to limit rather than anything else.)
However, if I enter the following code:


```
def fracintegral(func,n, xsub=x,a=0):
    t = var('t')
    assume(t > a)
    assume(x > a)
    return integrate(((x-t)^(n-1))*func(t),t,a,x)/gamma(n)
a = fracintegral(sin(x),1/2);a
```


I get the following returned:


```
-1/2*(sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) +
sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) +
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) -
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) -
2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, minus))/sqrt(pi)
```


If I copy/paste this into a new sage notebook cell, I get the following error:


```

```


If I fix up the minus by doing this,


```
-1/2*(sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) +
sqrt(x)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) +
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*x) -
I*sqrt(x)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*x) -
2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, 'minus'))/sqrt(pi)
```


I get this error:


```

    raise ValueError, "call the limit function like this, e.g. limit(expr, x=2)."
ValueError: call the limit function like this, e.g. limit(expr, x=2).
```


Then if I write it up in correct limit syntax like so:


```
b = 2*limit(1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(-t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) -
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(-t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t=0, dir='minus'); b
```


I get literally nothing from the notebook cell. If I then enter b and evaluate in the next cell I get this:


```
2*limit(1/2*I*sqrt(t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) +
1/2*I*sqrt(t)*sin(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t) +
1/2*sqrt(t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, -I*t) -
1/2*sqrt(t)*cos(x)*exp_integral_e(1/2, I*t), t, 0, minus)
```



This is all with Pretty Printing turned off. If I turn on Pretty Printing, then the reply from the fracintegral call (on trig functions and exponents) is this:

Let me know if I should put this into another ticket for limit, but kcrisman asked me to put this up here first.

Looks good!  A few quirks I've noticed:

(1) li behaves a little differently with respect to autoevaluation at 0:


```
sage: Si(0)
0
sage: Shi(0)
0
sage: li(0)

sage: li(0).simplify()
0
sage: li(0).n()
0.000000000000000

(2) In the (probably semi-deprecated; it works with Python floats) exponential_integral_1, we should special-case 0:


```
sage: exp_integral_e1(0.01)
4.03792957653811
sage: exponential_integral_1(0.01)
4.037929576538114

(3) There's something going on with integration I don't understand:


```

x*sinh_integral(x) - cosh(x)
sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2)
-cosh(1/2) + 1/2*sinh_integral(1/2) + 1

sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0.0, 0.5)
0.125872409703 + 1.57079632679*I

```


IOW, somehow we pick up a pi/2 I, and it probably happens on our side:


```

In [7]: quad(lambda x: shi(x), [0, 0.5])
Out[7]: mpf('0.12587240970345281')

```

Thanks, kcrisman.  Since after real-world discussions it appears that the integration difficulty is another Maxima quirk, I don't think we should hold up approving this, especially because it can be worked around.  I do think it's worth warning the user, and the example will serve as a reminder to us that it can be removed when we update to a version of Maxima which finally fixes it, 'cause the doctest will fail.

So I propose adding the following to EXAMPLES for sinh_integral:


```

    Note that due to some problems with the way Maxima handles these
    expressions, definite integrals can sometimes give unexpected
    results (typically when using inexact endpoints) due to
    inconsistent branching::

        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2)
        -cosh(1/2) + 1/2*sinh_integral(1/2) + 1
        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 1/2).n() # right
        0.125872409703453
        sage: integrate(sinh_integral(x), x, 0, 0.5).n() # wrong!
        0.125872409703453 + 1.57079632679490*I

I don't like this.

```
sage: li(0)
0
sage: type(li(0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
sage: Si(0)
0
sage: type(Si(0))
<type 'sage.rings.integer.Integer'>
```

The reason is 

```
        # special case: z = 0 
	        if isinstance(z, Expression): 
	            if z.is_trivial_zero(): 
	                return z 
	        else: 
	            if not z: 
	                return z 
```

type code, because of course the zero `z` we input is not an expression, but is `not z`, so we return the **Integer** zero instead of the **symbolic** zero.

Of course, we're inconsistent here:

```
sage: sin(0)
0
sage: type(sin(0))
<type 'int'>
```

Oops.  But under the philosophy of

```
sage: f(x) = x^2
sage: f(0)
0
sage: type(f(0))
<type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
```

I think we should return an `Expression`.

With the patches applied to 5.0, my fractional integral code works on sine functions, but I still get the following error if pretty printing is on. Is there a trac post for this?


```
def fracintegral(func,xsub,n,a=0):
    t = var('t')
    assume(t > a)
    assume(x > a)
    return integrate((x-t)^(n-1)*func.subs({xsub:t}),t,a,x)/gamma(n)
a = fracintegral(sin(x),x,1/2)
a

```

Returns this on the call to a (but not on the assignment of a =):

I am not sure what is going on here.  Testing this by hand works, testing it in the doctest doesn't.  It's definitely the main patch that causes this.

I had a few semi-educated guesses, but they didn't seem to work.  I'll keep digging.
