# Issue 23595: Patchbot failure metaticket

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23832

Original creator: mderickx

The goal of this metaticket is to make it easy to see if there is already a ticket for failures of some patchbots. If a patchbot failure is not on the list, please make a ticket for it if it does not yet exist and add it together with the affected files!

src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py

Changing component from doctest framework to misc.

I think we can remove the fixed issues, otherwise this will get long very fast.

I agree, but I prefer we just remove them depending on the beta version in which things were fixed. And just keep the things from the most recent beta and the previous one here. Since that info might still be usefull.

p.s. Jeroen what do you think about the priority of reproducible but random failing doctests? Say it fails about once in `x` times where `x` is some number.

I have the feeling that failing (but not silently producing incorrect answers) one out of three tests should definitely still be blocker priority, and failing (but not silently) once in every 10<sup>6</sup> times does not deserve to be a blocker anymore. What would be a reasonable guideline for a cutoff? Once in a hundred?

Of course creating a stopgap for something that silently produces the wrong answer deserves to be a blocker no matter how rare.

This question is relevant to #23933, #23391.
