Honestly, considering all bugs we had with this algorithm in the past, I believe that we should remove it if nobody is willing to check it entirely.

Add a stopgap if you like, but if the code is buggy and if nobody knows how to fix it, we would be better without it.

Really, it is far from being the first time that this code returns wrong answers. Plus it is not even the default algorithm !

Hello Frédéric,

Instead of returning a `ValueError` could you show a deprecation warning instead? Something saying that the keyword is not used anymore, has been implicitly replaced by the only value available. This way one year from now we will be able to remove this keyword. Otherwise we'll keep it along forever.

YOoooooo,

I'm sorry but you can't just remove the 'ryser' flags on the doctests. 'ryser' was not architecture-dependent, but 'gale' is as it relies on a LP solver.

Given that you kindly replaced this exception I'll try to fix this myself in a commit. Sorry I'm a bit slow today, I'm sick and everything is slower than usual.

Yoo again.

I thought that it would require some work, but as there is already a 'clean' doctest that tries random input and checks the behaviour in an architecture-independent way, I just flagged all the other doctests with '# random'. They are not checked anymore but still serve as documentation, and the checks still appear in the loop.
