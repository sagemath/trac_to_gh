I'd rather fix this as part of #22344.

Bot is now squarely green.

This is a simplification of the comparison framework. Once the same thing is done in #22427 for the remaining 2 calls to `_richcmp` (in complex numbers), one will be able to get rid of `_richcmp`. Let me recall that handling the comparison is one of the major problems standing on our way to python3.

While I fundamentally agree with Jeroen, I think it is better for us to make progress in the more immediate as work on #22344 has currently stalled.
