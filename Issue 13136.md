# Issue 13136: eigenspaces_left sometimes raises an error while the documentation sais it should work.

Issue created by migration from Trac.

See the following example


```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(Gamma1(23), sign=1)
sage: m=M.cuspidal_subspace().hecke_matrix(2)
sage: m.eigenspaces_left()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ValueError: variable names must be alphanumeric, but one is 'aa0 + 3' which is not.
```


In this example m is a matrix with rational coefficients. So according to the documentation this should just work.

The problem was that the variable `i` from the list comprehension on line 4807 leaked into the outer scope, overwriting the loop variable of the same name from the outer for-loop. The latter is used in constructing the name of a generator for the root field. In some cases the generator name therefore became invalid (e.g. `aa0+3`).

Thanks for the quick fix. I didn't expect someone else to magically run into this ticket and write a fix this fast :). The modified documentation doesn't display correctly in the html version of the doc. The sentence:

check that #13308 is fixed:

was shown as a part of the block of sage code while it should be rendered as text. While I was at it I also used the nifty feature to create hyper links to sage trac tickets. And I changed the doctests so that it tests that the found eigen vectors are really eigen vectors instead of just storing the results in a variable called tmp.

Do you agree with the minor improvements I made?

I happened to stumble upon it in the timeline, and since it was a rather curious bug I wanted to see what's going on :).

I agree with all of your changes - it's much better now.

Ok. I'm now waiting for the doctests to finnish. After that I think this one can have a positive review.

The only test that failed was:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests failed:

	sage -t --long devel/sage-main/sage/tests/startup.py # 1 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------

But this was because I was testing on a slow disk on sage.math. So it's not caused by this ticket.
