Keywords: segfault

In #12313, it was discovered in a painful way that Sage tries to deallocate twice memory allocated for reduction strategies in pbori.

As this fix is now needed by other tickets like #715, I've put the fix on an independent ticket.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13746

OK, you took the patch from #12313 and removed the bits that now belong to #13741, right?

I don't recall who wrote most of the code in the patch - in other words: Who can be reviewer for it?

No, the two patches were orthogonal, they touched different part of quit_sage.
I'm not completely sure the additional garbage collection we introduce here is really needed, but it cannot hurt for sure (or it can reveal nasty bugs :) which is good).
> I don't recall who wrote most of the code in the patch - in other words: Who can be reviewer for it?
I think the patch was already positively reviewed during the process of reviewing #12313, so you or Nils could set this ticket to positive review, I just don't feel doing it as I've opened the ticket.

Sorry, you are totally right! What I moved to #13471 came from #12215 or so...

> I'm not completely sure the additional garbage collection we introduce here is really needed, but it cannot hurt for sure (or it can reveal nasty bugs :) which is good).

Indeed!

Not before running a full test...

My guess is that the error is unrelated (it seems to come from a killed Gap session). To be on the safe side, I've just kicked the patchbot, so that it should now repeat the tests.
