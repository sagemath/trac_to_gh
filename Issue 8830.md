Per the discussion on #8192, the polybori spkg there caused crashes and valgrind errors on exit.

The new spkg to fix this created by Alexander Dreyer and Minh Nguyen is at:

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mvngu/spkg/standard/polybori/polybori-0.6.4.p0.spkg

I tested it, and it gets rid of the valgrind errors and crashes.
