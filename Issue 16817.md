Keywords: rigged configurations

Because it modifies the vacancy numbers:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.RiggedConfigurations(['A',2])
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['A',2,1], [[1,1]]*4 + [[2,1]]*4)
sage: x = B.an_element().f_string([2,2,1,1,2,1,2,1])
sage: ascii_art(x)
-4[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  -4[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
sage: ascii_art(RC(x))
0[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  0[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
sage: ascii_art(x)
0[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  0[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
```

Your explanation of what the issue is, is not very clear (plus the description is not even a full sentence). Please say precisely what currently happens, why it is wrong, and how you fixed it!

Thanks,

Anne

Note that after passing through the constructor, the original element changes.
