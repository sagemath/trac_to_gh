Keywords: rigged configurations

Because it modifies the vacancy numbers:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.RiggedConfigurations(['A',2])
sage: RC = RiggedConfigurations(['A',2,1], [[1,1]]*4 + [[2,1]]*4)
sage: x = B.an_element().f_string([2,2,1,1,2,1,2,1])
sage: ascii_art(x)
-4[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  -4[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
sage: ascii_art(RC(x))
0[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  0[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
sage: ascii_art(x)
0[ ][ ][ ][ ]-4  0[ ][ ][ ][ ]0
```
