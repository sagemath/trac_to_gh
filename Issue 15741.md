Jernej reported that Sage took <a lifetime> to enumerate the edges of an important graph of his. There was actually a comment in the source code which I left then forgot, saying that this particular block of code was totally awful.

Was.

Probably a stupid question, but: Why is `CompleteGraph(3000)` a `SparseGraph`?

I don't know anything about the graph code, but I did a bit of profiling out of curiosity. And it looks like nested loops such as

```
# SparseGraph.iterator_edges
for u_int in self._cg.out_neighbors(v_int):
    if u_int >= v_int:
        for l_int in self._cg.all_arcs(v_int, u_int):
            ...
```

are a pretty redundant and not too cache-friendly way of enumerating the edges. In particular:
* `all_arcs_unsafe(u, v, ...)` seems to spend LOTS of time looking for `temp` such that `temp.vertex == v`, while (if I understand correctly) `out_neighbors_unsafe` already had to visit the corresponding `SparseGraphBTNode`. But perhaps the graph is just too dense for the hash table to do its job, and it would work just fine with a sparse graph?
* The test `u_int <= v_int` can also be a bit expensive, perhaps due to branch mispredictions or something like that.

No good answer to that. There is a Dense Graph backend which is never used unless you ask for it, and as it is never tested I expect it to be quite buggy.

I should either rewrite the default backend for graphs, or write lower-level code for functions like that. 

I just hate labels and multiple edges.....

Well. What I should do is try again to read and document, and rewrite this at lower level. Definitely.

I mean... You are right in what you say, it is just that I have to read and understand very undocumented code, and that to be honest I don't have performance problems myself. But I will do that next week, definitely.

Thanks.

```
sage: Tab  = CrystalOfTableaux(['A', 3], shape = [2,1,1])           
sage: g=Tab.digraph()                                    
sage: u,v = g.vertices()[:2]                             
sage: u <= v
...
RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in cmp
```


What the hell can I do with that ?

Before, the following code was called :

```
sage: cmp(u,v)              
-1
```

Okay, here it is. I replaced the `<=` with `<` which changes nothing for us and does not change any doctest either, except that the crystal doctests works now.

And I wrote to sage-combinat-devel about that.

I set it back to `positive_review` after having checked that all long doctests in graph/ and combinat/crystal pass.

By the way the doctests in combinat/crystals/ take a lifetime.
