When I add an `arrow3d` (for example), then it displays properly:

```
sage: polygon3d([[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,0]]) + arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1])
sage: p2.plot() + arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1])
```

It seems like it is just ignoring the polygon3d when it is the only object:

```
sage: p = polygon3d([[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,0]]) + arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1])
sage: rp = p.default_render_params()
sage: rp.output_archive = None
sage: p.jmol_repr(rp)

sage: p = polygon3d([[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,0]]) + arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1])
sage: p.jmol_repr(rp)

sage: type(p)
<class 'sage.plot.plot3d.base.Graphics3dGroup'>

sage: p = arrow3d([0,0,0],[1,1,1])
sage: p.plot()    # This works fine
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
sage: p.jmol_repr(rp)
[[['\ndraw line_5 width 0.02 {0.0 0.0 0.0} {0.896076951546 0.896076951546 0.896076951546}\ncolor $line_5  [102,102,255]\n'],

A somewhat strange thing is that the graphics group `jmol_repr` calls the `jmol_repr` of the polygon. Perhaps someone has an idea about this (and knows how to read the jmol input).

I don't think this is a Sage problem. If you look at the temporary files under the hidden `User/.sage` directory that are passed to the Jmol viewer, the `pmesh` files for the polygons are there and included every time in the `SCRIPT` file in `scene.spt.zip`. The data for the polygons is exactly the same whether or not the arrow is included.

As a test, run this at the command line:


```
p=polygon([(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,1,0)])
for n in range(1,10):
     p+=polygon([(n,0,0),(n+1,0,0),(n+1,n+1,0)])
     p
```


When I run it the polygons don't being to appear until there are six of them, and don't appear reliably for higher numbers.

I think this is a Jmol display problem.
