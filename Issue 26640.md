For Type A and Type E6, E7 Fusion rings the roots do not span the ambient space. The basis should be projected into the space spanned by the roots.


```
sage: A22=FusionRing("A2",2)
sage: A22.basis()
Finite family {(0, 0, 0): A22(0,0), (1, 1, 0): A22(0,1), (1, 0, 0):
A22(1,0), (2, 0, 0): A22(2,0), (2, 2, 0): A22(0,2), (2, 1, 0): A22(1,1)}
sage: b=A22.basis().list()[2]; b
A22(1,0)
sage: b.highest_weight()
(1, 0, 0)
sage: A22(1,0).highest_weight()
(2/3, -1/3, -1/3)
```


The last two answers should be the same. The fix is to run the `from_vector_notation` method of the ambient space on the basis.

> Ready for a full review?

I changed the  ticket to needs review.

One minor point: you had originally suggested making this test conditional
on `style="coroots"`. 

But if `FusionRing` is used as intended, style will be "coroots" every
time this code is reached, because the test is already conditioned on `k is not None`. 
So I omitted the test and pass `style=style` to the `from_vector_notation`.
