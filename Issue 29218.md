The `incidence_matrix` method of a 0-dimensional `CombinatorialPolyhedron` returns an error:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[0]]); P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: C = P.combinatorial_polyhedron()
sage: C.incidence_matrix()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 C.incidence_matrix()

See patchbots:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/combinatorial_polyhedron/base.pyx  # 2 doctests failed

Sorry, it is my mistake since I put it on "positive review".
Now the tests look fine. So I will but it again on "positive review".
