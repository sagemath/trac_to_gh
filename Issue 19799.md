Helloooooooo !

Looks good.

Could you add a link toward the wikipedia page (using the `:wikipedia:` role), which provides a longer description of this polytope? 

Could you also add a reference toward the place where you obtained the coordinates of the vertices?

In all other constructors of the file, it seems that 'exact=True' is the default. Here, building the polytope on an exact ring takes around 11s on my computer. Vincent, what do you think? Break the 'exact=True' standard or make it slow by default, and fast upon request?

Finally, it's probably a question of style but you could first import 'product' from itertools, then only call 'product'. But well, that's style, do whatever you prefer.

Thanks,

Nathann

OK, I'll add the links. The coordinates were obtained by combining information of one website with the coordinates available for the 600-cell. The website actually has slightly different coordinates and they also have a typo in their coordinates (but I notified them of this, so it should be fixed there soon).

The 'exact=False' was actually copied from the 600-cell with which this polytopes shares all of its vertices.

Also the way product is used is also a copy of the 600-cell. However, I had to repeat it several times here, so I guess that there are certainly arguments for the import in this case.

Okay okay, cool!

Arggggg.. The 600-cell. Right. Which is very slow to build too, if I remember correctly `^^;`

Vincent? What do you think?

Well, the 600-cell takes roughly 30 seconds on my computer with exact=True (vs. 1.5 seconds with exact=False). I don't know if this is faster than it used to be. The grand antiprism takes 14 seconds (vs. 0.4 seconds). In principle this is acceptable for me to be the default. Is this too long for the tests?

Helloooooo Nico,

My apologies for having been rather slow to answer during the last days. I was on the moves with only my phone to read emails, and it was hard to do anything Sage-related.

Thank you for the modifications you made to the code. I would say that a doctest that takes 15 seconds to run is too long, especially if we can "almost test it" by other means, i.e. with non-exact coordinates. So it is fine for me to not test the `exact=True` branch.

About the default value: it is true that the 600-cells is already by default in `exact=False` so, well, as this polytope is related to it I guess that it is fine if you prefer to keep an `exact=False` there. There is certainly some sense to it.

My last remark is about the reference you added: it looks odd, as a 'reference' entry usually contains additional details like title/author or something. You can either improve the entry you added or, if you only want to link toward some web page, merely add a link in the documentation.

Note that you can turn any text into a link with Sphinx, in case you do not want the URL to appear in the doc:

    http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/sage_manuals.html#hyperlinks

Good evening,

Nathann

Hi Nathann

I have absolutely no complaint about the speed with which you reply. :-)

I will fix the reference later today (Currently also in transit). The last two years I have had little time, and have only contributed to Sage intermittently and only when I needed something for myself (like this grand antiprism). Unfortunately this has meant that I keep having a bad mental picture of the style of code and documentation.

Cheers
Nico

I compared the user experience with both values for `exact`, and my impression is that although `exact=True` is slower, the waiting time is acceptable in this case.

Hellooooooooo !

The branch looks fine to me: thank you for your updates. I switch it to `positive_review`.
