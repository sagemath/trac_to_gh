Okay, I have a new spkg, actually, two.  The first ("p0") is just a straightforward upgrade of the previous version.  However, we should probably update sage_autodoc.py in light of changes to the Sphinx extension autodoc.py, on which it is based.  I can provide a patch to the Sage library modifying sage_autodoc.py if necessary.

A different approach: the second spkg ("p1") autogenerates sage_autodoc.py from autodoc.py, and saves sage_autodoc.py in sphinx/ext instead of in sage/doc/common.  So using this one requires a change to sage/doc/common/conf.py, which I've provided.

With both of these approaches, I get some warnings about cross-references, which are why the other entries are in the patch for the Sage library.  I'm seeing lots of broken cross-references, though: take a look at the reference manual for categories/examples/finite_weyl_groups.py: 

```
    Only the following basic operations are implemented:

None of these produces a link.  I don't know what's going on.
