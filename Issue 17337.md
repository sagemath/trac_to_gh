# Issue 17337: Empty hypergraph and __str__ function

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Right now an exception is raised when building the empty hypergraph. This branch fixes it:

```
sage: sage: IncidenceStructure([])
Incidence structure with 0 points and 0 blocks
```


Also, right now the class has both a `__repr__` and a `__str__` function, which means that typing `H` in a console does not produce the same output as typing `print H` in a script. The two functions are made equal: I work often with this class and pretty often the result of `print H` takes a whole screen, as it displays *all blocks*.

Hey,

It can be useful to keep a function printing all blocks as it is the case with matrices right now with the method `.str()`:

```
sage: m = random_matrix(ZZ,100)
sage: m
100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
sage: print m
100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring
sage: m.str()
... # crazy string
```

And it is true that `__repr__` and `__str__` coincide.

```
sage: m.__repr__()
'100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring'
sage: m.__str__()
'100 x 100 dense matrix over Integer Ring'
```


To get a hint when only `m` is typed, you need to hack `repl/display/fancy_repr.py`.

Yo !

But we have `H.blocks()`, don't we ? Why would we need something else ?

On the other hand, I often need to control variables, to make sure that the input is a `PairwiseBalancedDesign` and not just an incidence structure, and all that I could do so far was `print H.__repr__()`.
