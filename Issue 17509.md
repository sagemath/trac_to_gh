# Issue 17509: Let sage-native-execute also forget about Sage's own Python.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17746

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2015-02-08 12:15:36

`sage-native-execute` aims at executing programs out of the sage virtual environment, by resetting some variables. However, Python-related ones are not reset, which causes trouble when one want to launch a command that depends on the system's Python. So, let us reset them too.

See #17735 and #14414.
