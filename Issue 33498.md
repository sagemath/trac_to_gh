There are at least three types of warnings we might silence:

- `UserWarning: The soupsieve package is not installed` — this appears multiple times and I think it can be ignored.
- Several modules have been deprecated and as a result have no documentation anymore, so we should remove them from the reference manual. The corresponding warnings are `Warning: Missing title for sage.libs.pynac.pynac` and also for `sage.finance.time_series`, `sage.symbolic.getitem`, and `sage.symbolic.constants_c`.
- We might also remove other deprecated modules/packages from the reference manual, and in particular `sage.media` and `sage.finance`. I don't know if this is a good idea or not. Do it now or wait until the packages are actually removed?

I haven't made any changes to the items in the third bullet point. I removed the items in the second, but they all look like this: [sage.symbolic.getitem page](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/getitem.html).

Are you talking about deprecated modules like `sage.media` which still have proper docstrings, but which might say that they are deprecated, or are you talking about the ones with no current content? I hope that in the second case, the people who did the deprecation paid attention to what needed to be documented at the time and just forgot to clean up the reference manual. Further, the relevant tickets were closed 7 months ago and were in Sage 9.5, released at the end of January. So it will likely be 3 months with the documentation in its current stage, and I just don't believe that it's worth restoring them. Have there been any complaints about these pages?

That is, I prefer my approach. If you want to create docstrings for those files, I think it's a waste of time, but don't let that stop you.

I was thinking of the former case. Files with truely no content should be deleted altogether, but I am guessing you mean no docstring content. All I am thinking is having a title of something like:

```
"""
Media (deprecated)
"""
```
Nothing else is needed beyond this (other than possibly adding a ref to the deprecating ticket).

> That is, I prefer my approach. If you want to create docstrings for those files, I think it's a waste of time, but don't let that stop you.


These docstrings last a bit longer on the the Sage doc since they only get updated between major versions. Thus, it is possible it lasts longer than the files within beta versions of Sage.

Unfortunately I don't have my computer with me for the next few days. I won't be able to push something until Sunday.

Good, that makes sense.

> Files with truely no content should be deleted altogether, but I am guessing you mean no docstring content.


The pages I'm currently removing from the reference manual come from Python files that look like, for example (`symbolic/getitem.py`):

```
from sage.misc.lazy_import import lazy_import
lazy_import('sage.symbolic.expression',
            ['normalize_index_for_doctests', 'OperandsWrapper', 'restore_op_wrapper'],
            deprecation=32386)
```
(That's the entire file.)

> All I am thinking is having a title of something like:
>

> ```
> Nothing else is needed beyond this (other than possibly adding a ref to the deprecating ticket).


That could be done on this ticket or on a future ticket. Could the deprecation function somehow take care of this automatically, when you're deprecating a module or a package?

Anyway, as of now:
- `sage.media.wav` already has a line in its top-level docstring saying "This module (and all of sage.media) is deprecated."
- `sage.structure.graphics_file` has no such message.
- `sage.finance` doesn't have any such messages, either. 

We could change the reference manual `.rst` files instead:

```diff

Do we need the missing titles restored, or is it better to just remove the pages from the reference manual? There is no actual content in the file from the point of view of documentation.

Replying to [comment:24 mkoeppe]:
> I don't really have an opinion on this, just currently these files violate our style guide


IMO, we want the files there with the title in the documentation (and a deprecation message) because we should be documenting all of our files and changes. Even though it is deprecated, I don’t think it is good for a project to have “hidden” files.

This should be done on this ticket IMO as adding it back on.a future ticket would effectively be reverting this one.

I would argue that those files (other than `all.py`, which are special and we have some general guidelines, or at least practices/conventions, about those) should be included in the reference manual. They are describing Sage’s functionality in a public-facing way. In this case, these files were previously there, but they would be apparently disappearing without a deprecation from that perspective.
