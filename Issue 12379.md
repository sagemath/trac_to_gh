Keywords: function fields

`characteristic()` relies on `constant_field()` which is not implemented for extensions of `RationalFunctionField`:


```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2-x)
sage: L.characteristic()
NotImplementedError
```


The attached patch fixes this.
