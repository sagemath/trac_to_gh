Keywords: py3

In Sage built with Python 3 deprecation warnings raised from Cython code are not visible (in both the console or Jupyter notebook). However they are visible to the doctest runner!

Example from `sage/matroids/matroid.pyx`

```
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(2, 3).is_3connected(separation=True)
```

Example from `sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx`

```
sage: M = matrix(2, [2,1,1,1])._invert_unit()
```


Here is an example from a Python file that works fine

```
sage: P = Permutations(4)
sage: x = P([3, 2, 4, 1]).has_left_descent(2, mult='l2r')
```

I'm not sure how to fix the problem, but the reason things fail is because cython functions don't create a stack frame. The deprecation mechanism tries to raise the warning referring to the stack frame of the call site. That's not there in this case! You can see that things work when you make sure that there is a call frame present:

```
sage: def g():
....:     return f()
....: 
sage: g()
/usr/local/sage/sage-git/src/bin/sage-ipython:1: DeprecationWarning: hello
See https://trac.sagemath.org/28500 for details.
  #!/usr/bin/env sage-python23
```

It goes back to the python "warning" system:

```
sage: cython("""
....: from warnings import warn
....: def cyW(s):
....:     warn("test",DeprecationWarning,stacklevel=s)
....: """)
```


```
sage: def pyW(s):
....:     warn("test",DeprecationWarning,stacklevel=s)
```


```
sage: def testW(c,s):
....:     if c=="cython":     
....:         cyW(s)
....:     else:
....:         pyW(s)
```

you'll see that `testW("python",3)` and `test("cython",2)` have the same result (that's at top level) and that `testW("python",4)` and `test("cython",3)` also have the same result (no warning printed, because the stack frame lookup failed). It could be considered a bug in python that `warn(..., stacklevel=...")` fails silently if the give stack level is too high.

I think the fix is that cython's "deprecation" should be a different one from python's; and should reduce its stacklevel by one from the value used in python.

There is also the problem that we shouldn't expect deprecation warnings to work properly when called from cython, but that's going to apply to all warnings.

Similar to the inserted doctest, you can catch raised deprecation warnings and investigate if they are referencing the right callsite. If you make sure you call the deprecated routine from a recognizable location you can check that the raised warning is referencing it. More particularly, if you want to make sure that deprecation warnings are not referring to one-level-too-high you could install in the doctest framework a warning filter [https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#overriding-the-default-filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#overriding-the-default-filter) that generates an error rather than a warning.

For documentation: If you adapt it how you'd like it, I'm fine with it. I never know which bits of documentation get processed/placed where.
