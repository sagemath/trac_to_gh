patchbot coverage plugin complains here about something not relevant to this ticket/branch. And, by the way, there is also now #21889 ready for review, depending 
on this ticket...

timeouts on the bot are irrelevant, caused by giac.

patchbot says

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py  # Timed out
sage -t --long src/sage/modular/abvar/abvar.py  # Timed out
```

but this is certainly nothing to worry about.

a startup plugin failing, but otherwise (sane) patchbots are happy.

Some small tweaks:

- Period missing at the end of the 1-line description.
- `..math::` -> `.. MATH::`.
- `<v,o_1>` -> `\langle v, o_1 \rangle` (and similar).

Thanks a a lot. It's hard to find people to review...

Sorry for not helping reviewing this ticket, but I'm not confident with this kind of construction.
