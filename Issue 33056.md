The computation in this doctest takes a few seconds, but checking the output takes the doctest framework more than 4 minutes. There is no warning about this taking a long time.

```
sage: a = ZZ['x'](range(100000))
sage: R = Integers(3)['x']
sage: R(a)  # long time (7s on sage.math, 2013)
2*x^99998 + ... + x
```

It would be easy to rewrite the last line to make it fast, but ideally

- parsing the doctest output should be faster
- long time warnings should take into account the time it takes to check the output in order to make it easier to find slow doctests like this one


After deleting this doctest:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 30.0 --random-seed=127464012278616651004415010266788953280 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx
    [140 tests, 0.26 s]
```

Before:

Thank you. I think we should also change this regular expression:


```diff
-ld_warning_regex = re.compile(r'.*dylib.*was built for newer macOS version.*than being linked.*')
+ld_warning_regex = re.compile(r'^.*dylib.*was built for newer macOS version.*than being linked.*')
```


It is used with `re.sub()` which looks for all occurrences of the pattern in a string, so using `.*` at the front leads to accidentally quadratic runtime.

Meanwhile, I have only found two more doctests that were slowed down a lot due to the same problem

```
File "src/sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 6667, in sage.rings.integer.Integer.inverse_mod
    c = a.inverse_mod(a*a)   # long time
File "src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/isogeny_small_degree.py", line 1553, in sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.isogeny_small_degree.Psi2
    Psi2(71)  # long time (1 second)
```

which took about 77 and 190 seconds.

Should this be a new ticket or done here? I can create a branch for that.

Either way. I have a vaguely conflicting branch in #32981 but it won't be hard to rebase.

The timing information is currently obtained in `forker.py` within the `compile_and_execute()` method:


```python
timer = Timer().start()
try:
    compiled = compiler(example)
    timer.start()    # reset timer                                                                                                                                   
    exec(compiled, globs)
    finally:
        timer.stop().annotate(example)
```


That's used in `_run()`, and we check the output after `compile_and_execute()` has been run and the timing information already obtained.

The cleanest way to update that might be to use a separate timer for the output checking, and to simply add up the two numbers at the end? Otherwise we'd have to pull the timer up out of `compile_and_execute()` and into `_run()` so that we can stop it after the output has been checked.

Ok, I will open a new ticket then to avoid unnecessary conflicts, as the current branch seems already good to me.

If we add a separate timer just for the output checking, should it measure cpu time rather than wall time?

All the suggestions have been implemented, so I think we can move forward with this. Please revert this, Samuel, in case you have further concerns.

I do not understand what is wrong with the patchbot though, but the tests have passed already with the previous beta.

No further concerns, comment:14 was maybe a bit hasty.

The `psi2` doctest might in fact still qualify for the
`# long time` marker.

Frédéric, do you understand the "doctest continuation"
patchbot plugin reports?

The continuation plugin is about checking the `....:` syntax of continuation lines. The plugin failure seems to be a false positive.

Though, at the time of my previous comment, the bot was stuck in status "pending" which is what I did not understand. The bot had already moved on to other tickets. Only after telling it to retry this ticket, it actually ran the tests – and the previous "pending" report was replaced by the new report.
