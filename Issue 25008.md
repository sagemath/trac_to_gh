# Issue 25008: Component groups and tamagawa numbers for ambient Jacobian

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25245

Keywords: tamagawa, component group, modular jacobian,

Currently, Sage can only compute the component group invariants and tamagawa numbers for optimal quotients. This is done as a result of William Stein by reducing it to the case of an ambient Jacobian so it should not be hard to implement it. This is the goal of the ticket.
