If we want to remove the `element_constructor` argument to `Parent.__init__`, we should fix this:

```
cdef class Set_PythonType_class(Set_generic):
    [...]
    def __init__(self, theType):
        [...]
        Set_generic.__init__(self, element_constructor=theType, category=Sets())
        self._type = theType
```
