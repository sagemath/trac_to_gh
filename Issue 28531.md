this looks very obscure.

How about using Sage 9.0 or even 9.1betas with openblas from the system?

Googling, and the only reference I can find to `-l4` would be if you passed the flag `-l4` to `make`, in which case if you got something like this it would be some kind of flag confusion.  I can't imagine otherwise what this would mean.

Erik, I guess you found it. I have in my environment:

```
export MAKEFLAGS="-j4 -l4"
```

which means to use 4 threads for `make`, but with a global limit of 4 for the cpu load.
I guess the `MAKEFLAGS` variable is used somewhere in the Sage and/or OpenBLAS makefile,
and not properly protected.
