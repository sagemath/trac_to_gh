Noticed that the following example failed due to the adding of flatten to quo_rem:


```
R.<z>=PolynomialRing(QQbar,1)
(z^4 + (-3)*z^2)/z^3
```


So I've made the domains match up for multi- versus uni-variate polynomial rings.

**Errors:**

```
R.<l> = PolynomialRing(QQ,1)
S.<k,j> = PolynomialRing(R)
K.<a> = PolynomialRing(S,1)
J.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(K)
F = x^2 + y^2
G=F.specialization({y:56,j:5})
print G
G.parent()
```
 
Doesn't distinguish between Multivariate and Univariate, also has this problem in Subschemes.


```
R.<l> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
S.<k,j> = PolynomialRing(R)
K.<a,b,c,d> = S[]
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
H = End(P)
Q=P([a^2,b^2])
Q.specialization({a:2})
```

Doesn't like having four variables.

**Questions:**
Should the two examples below work?


```
S.<p,q> = QQ[]
A.<r> = AffineSpace(S,1)
F = (r^2 + p*r^2)/(q+p)
G=F.specialization({p:42})
```


```
A.<i,j,k> = QuaternionAlgebra(QQ, -1,-1)
R.<w,v> = PolynomialRing(A)
F = w^3 + (i+j)*w + 1
G=F.specialization({w:7})
```

I fixed the two examples that didn't work.

For the other two questionable examples: it would be nice if fraction field elements of polynomial rings could also be specialized, but I think that should be its own ticket. The Quaternion algebra one is not failing in this code, so no on that one.
