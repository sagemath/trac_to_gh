# Issue 26566: Error message in szeged_index()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/26803

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2018-12-03 11:21:58

`Graph({0: [1], 2: []}).szeged_index()` gives `KeyError: 2`. No idea about what is Szeged index, but anyways at least the error message should be better.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged_index, this index is defined for connected graphs only.

I added a test and a doctest, a link to the wikipedia page for easier access to definition,  and took the opportunity to do PEP8 cleaning of this method.

Seems good, but test for a ticket should go to `TESTS::` section instead of `EXAMPLES::`.
