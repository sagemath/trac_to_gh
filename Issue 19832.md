All `is_RealIntervalField` does is

```python
return isinstance(x, RealIntervalField_class)
```

So I think a better check would be

```python
if isinstance(x.parent(), (RealIntervalField_class, RealBallField)):
```

Also, could you make the statement `:trac:`20069`::` a little more verbose? Something like

```
Check that this works for arb elements (:trac:`20069`)::
```
