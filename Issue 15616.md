# Issue 15616: remove deprecated category Sequence

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15853

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-02-23 17:57:00

The *category `Sequence`* is deprecated since 2009 (commit `619aa0fa`). If I understand it correctly, the *class `Sequence`* should instead have the category `FiniteEnumeratedSets` (implying later implementation of `InfiniteSequence`).

This ticket is for removing the *category `Sequence`*. It depends on #15852.

Seems to be done already in the dependency.
