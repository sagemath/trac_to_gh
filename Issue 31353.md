This is a first version of the method.
- the name `plantri_gen` might not be best possible. Could be simply `plantri` ?
- I use a try except statement but I'm not sure it's the best way. We have an error when the combination of parameters does not allow plantri to generate any graph. Should we instead return nothing ?
- I have documented some parameters that are part of version 5.2 (release in 2021) but not of 4.5 (version released in 2011 that we use). I have opened #33120 to update to plantri 5.2.
