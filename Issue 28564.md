This is a follow-up to #25129 which attempted to fix script paths in the ThreeJS template on Windows.

It works in Chrome, however as reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/38) it does not work on Firefox for Windows, which is a bit fussier about how file paths are formatted in script tags.
