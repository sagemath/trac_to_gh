# Issue 11024: Bugfix in Poset/Lattice/Hassediagram

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: stumpc5

Original creation time: 2011-04-13 23:06:13

Assignee: sage-combinat

Keywords: poset, digraph

This patch fixes two minor bugs in the poset code.

1. LatticePoset should take the same input as Poset. E.g.,

```
sage: Poset(cover_relations=True)
Finite poset containing 0 elements
sage: LatticePoset(cover_relations=True)
...
TypeError: LatticePoset() got an unexpected keyword argument 'cover_relations'
```


2. The plot for posets does not properly pass the element_label dict to HasseDiagram.plot.
