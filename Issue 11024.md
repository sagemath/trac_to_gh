Keywords: poset, digraph

This patch fixes two minor bugs in the poset code.

1. LatticePoset should take the same input as Poset. E.g.,

```
sage: Poset(cover_relations=True)
Finite poset containing 0 elements
sage: LatticePoset(cover_relations=True)
...
TypeError: LatticePoset() got an unexpected keyword argument 'cover_relations'
```


2. The plot for posets does not properly pass the element_label dict to HasseDiagram.plot.
