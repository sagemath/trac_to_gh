Yes, this is an enhancement since it is implementing new functionality. 
It would be a bug fix if there were a bug in the existing arg function, where it produced invalid results on supported input.

I think the Maxima translation may not be correct.

```

 -- Function: carg (<z>)
     Returns the complex argument of <z>.  The complex argument is an
     angle `theta' in `(-%pi, %pi]' such that `r exp (theta %i) = <z>'
     where `r' is the magnitude of <z>.

     `carg' is a computational function, not a simplifying function.

     See also `abs' (complex magnitude), `polarform', `rectform',
     `realpart', and `imagpart'.

     Examples:

          (%i1) carg (1);
          (%o1)                           0

It also seems to help with the sqrt(2) issue, in a manner of speaking.  One could tell someone to do 

```
sage: arg(sqrt(2)+i).simplify()
arctan(1/2*sqrt(2))
```

```
