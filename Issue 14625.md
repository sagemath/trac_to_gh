# Issue 14625: Representations and latex representations of

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14829

Original creator: caruso

Original creation time: 2013-06-26 14:52:50

Assignee: roed

Keywords: printing uniformizer

This small package provides the functions `uniformizer_name` and `latex_uniformizer_name` that returns a "pretty" string/latex representation of the uniformizer of a discrete valuation ring/field (either a padic ring/field or a ring of Laurent series or a field of power series).

These functions can be useful because, in the padic world, a uniformizer prints itself together with some O(...).

* You used tab characters in this patch, which Python complains about
* You should add a commit message (by doing `sage -hg qrefresh -e` and editing the commit message before exporting the patch).

I don't understand which problem this patch is trying to solve and why you give errors when the base ring is not a field...
