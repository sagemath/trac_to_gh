The commit looks OK to me. Provided that the tests pass (and I have currently a slow internet connection, hence, building Sage will take very long...), it will be a positive review.

Wait! I just realise that the change is not in the code but in the tests. Hence, verifying that this particular test passes will suffice for the review.

What's the reason that you don't change the test to

```
sage: x.mro_standard
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: ...
```

Because that's inside a loop, and I want to check that this fails with a value error for every x.

OK, that's a good point.

Very minor thing: the indentation of the doctest doesn't look right.

Four blanks of indentation should be fine.
