please somebody have a look

This is the last file containing `#py2` tags. Here I remove only the simple ones, and the changes should rather be uncontroversial. The remaining cases are out of my capacity, and require an expert of pickle, that we may no longer have anywhere in sight..

One alternative would be #27350 (externalize) or just drop the file completely.

It would be wonderful for Erik Bray to work on #27350 and close this ticket as `invalid/wontfix`. 

If that would not happen, then I think we should fix `explain_pickle` for python3 before we remove the py2 tag, instead of "fixing" doctests for the broken `explain_pickle`.

seem wrong, which indicates it worked fine with py2 but is now broken with py3. Do we ever correct doctests for wrong output? I think leaving them with py2 tag is right if we do not fix the broken `explain_pickle`.

Indentations of outputs are wrong.

The pickle itself has changed. If you run `loads(dumps(100000r))`, it returns the correct object without error. In this case, it is likely because `int` has changed from Python2 to Python3.

> Indentations of outputs are wrong. 

Indeed; although I found the extra indentation level helped make clear what the doctest outputs were since they are so long with their own indentation. I don't hold a strong opinion on changing this or not.
