# Issue 25152: Clean up UniqueRepresentations in sage.algebra (part 2)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

This is like #25387 but adds `UniqueRepresentation` to classes that weren't using it (specifically in `sage.algebras.quatalg`) but looked like they could benefit.

Per nbruin's [comments](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25388#comment:10) on #25388, it doesn't really make sense and/or is overkill to use `UniqueRepresentation` for quaternion algebras, and what I really want here is some hypothetical mix-in class that provides equality and hashing by some specific set of attributes of each instance--typically attributes whose values are provided to the `__init__` (so long as they are hashable).

#25672 goes ahead and implements a `__hash__` for quaternion algebras.  I believe this should ultimately be removed as in this ticket (alone with the `__eq__`), but first we need the hypothetical class I mention above.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

Retargeting some of my tickets (somewhat optimistically for now).

Moving all my in-progress tickets to 8.8 milestone.

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.
