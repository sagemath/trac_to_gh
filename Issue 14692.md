This patch implements the Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions `hypergeometric_M` and `hypergeometric_U` (superseding the previous numerical-only version), complete with numeric evaluation, simplification, and transformation to generalized hypergeometric functions.

Whittaker functions can be easily implemented similarly; the reason I didn't include them in this patch is because the Maxima conversion is a bit more complicated.

Seems I found a Maxima interface problem with `hypergeometric`:

```
sage: hypergeometric_M(1,b,x).simplify_hypergeometric()
(b - 1)*x^(-b + 1)*e^x*gamma_greek(b - 1, x)
sage: hypergeometric([1],[b],x).simplify_hypergeometric()
(b - 1)*x^(-b + 1)*e^x*gamma_greek(b - 1, x)

I'm not so sure: according to the maxima documentation:

- gamma - gamma function (complete)
- gamma_greek - lower incomplete gamma function
- gamma_incomplete - upper incomplete gamma function

in sage, gamma(a,z) is documented to be the upper gamma function, which gets translated appropriately. We might not have a lower gamma function yet.

If maxima can produce `gamma_greek` spontaneously, then we should be able to make sense of it. The most straightforward way is by having a transliteration, `gamma_incomplete_lower` or `gamma_lower` perhaps. Adding new symbolic functions isn't *that* laborious, is it? Simplification methods can be grown later.

FYI: Mathematica seems to have Gamma[a,z] for upper and Gamma[a,0,z] for lower; Maple seems to have upper Gamma. So it does seem packages have been gravitating to the upper one more than the lower one. However, if that means our confluent hypergeometric functions always end up being translated into a more convoluted expression than a straight gamma_lower would give, we're not doing ourselves favours

(e.g., for numerical work: do you really want to evaluate gamma_lower(a,z) as gamma(z)-gamma_upper(a,z) ?)

Without strong indications in either direction, I'd be hesitant to make a choice and rather follow the lead of our main underlying engine: implement gamma_lower.

I assumed I needed keep track of changes from#16697 manually, but clearly Trac does that automatically.

Running a `doctest` on symbolic/expression_conversions.py gives an error:


```
ValueError: line 93 of the docstring for sage.symbolic.expression_conversions.InterfaceInit.derivative has inconsistent leading whitespace: '======='
```


This is the same file that had a merge conflict.
