Everything seems to work (nice!). Some naive questions from a user point of view:

- would it be possible to remove the "sage: " string in the cells? It would be convenient since it perturb the editor. It would even be worse with the continuation "....:" since these are not ignored by the sage preparser...

Less importantly:

- why did you decide to have this "Run" and "Run Again" buttons? These do not exist in the standard Jupyter notebook. Would it be possible to simply remove them?

- the cells are properly executed when pressing "Shift + Enter" but, contrarily to the case of the notebook, after pressing "Shift + Enter" the focus is kept in the same cell. Not sure that it is desirable to move the focus (since the next cell might be very far).

Hi Thierry,

Thanks for looking at this!

It was Volker's suggestion to just raw copy thebe.js in the sources.

One part of the rationale is simplicity. The other is that, once jupyterlab will have matured out, thebe.js is likely to become a thin layer on top of it, if not just a part of it. So it's not that crucial to take the efforts of a super clean long term solution.

But I don't have a strong opinion either.

Thanks Thierry for the final version of #21309 (Jeroen is double checking it right now) and for cleaning the history.

I agree that we are on a thin line here since we don't have strong review standards set for js files like this one. For example we are missing tests! However writing such tests would take some infrastructure; we should discuss how to setup such infrastructure with the Jupyter people at some point, but for now I guess that's ok.

Vincent, any further comment?

Cheers,
                                 Nicolas

For this, i had to merge with sage.7.3 because the exact same line in `build/make/deps` changed there. Let us test the build like this (it might take some time). Again, if you plan to do some modifications, do not forget to undo the very last merge (with #21309) before.

Here is some feedback after real-life testing. I am currently teaching for a 3-week Sage tutorial, and there is a workflow issue, somehow `thebe.js` miss the main point of the sagenb live documentation.

On sagenb notebook, say the students work on some thematic tutorial, they do some tests, copy some lecturer's examples and want to keep their changes. What they can do is to click on `File` (top left) and then `Copy worksheet` so that the live documentation becomes a true sagenb worksheet they can save to come back on it later.

In the current case, we can do some tests and modifications (which is great), but all the work is lost when we close the webpage. We should have a button to export the current state into a (possibly degradated, we do not really care about the subtle html structure) `.ipynb` file that can then be saved.
