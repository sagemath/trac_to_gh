Assignee: vdelecroix

CC:  tmonteil slabbe fougeroc

Keywords: continued fractions, numerical approximation

Continued fractions (in sage.rings.contfrac) does not what we expect:
* it only deals with rational numbers
* there is no dedicated method for numerical approximations (which is one of the first aim of continued fractions)
* there is no bridge with words (sage.combinat.words)

Moreover, categories are not properly initialized nor used.

The patch proposed here improves the current version.

Related tickets:
* #11345

Ralf, commit 7e0af96 is the wrong way to do fix it (take a look at the compiled documentation). Instead you should have removed the second colon from the `EXAMPLES::`. In other words, it should be formatted like this:

```
EXAMPLES:

Some docstring talking about the example::

    sage: 2 + 2
    4

Some more docstrings::

    sage: 4 - 2
    2
```


Thierry (or Vincent), did you have any comments about the current state of the branch?

This review is not polished, but i provide it as is, so that we can discuss. I also uploaded a (beginning of a) patch containing minor modifications, even if this corresponds to the old workflow.

----

`CFF` is not fully autonomous and behaves like an overlay over other Sage
fields, thus sacrificing reliability over expressivity.


```
sage: a = CFF(0.1)
sage: a.value()
1/10
```

vs

```
sage: a = CFF(0.1+sqrt(2))
sage: a.value()
sqrt(2) + 0.100000000000000
```


Hence the mess:


```
sage: a = CFF(0.1+sqrt(2))       
sage: b = CFF(0.1) + CFF(sqrt(2))
sage: a == b
True
```

but

```
sage: a
[1; 1, 1, 17, 11, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 281, 1, 10, 3, 2, 3, 21, 5, ...]
sage: b
[1; (1, 1, 17, 11, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 2, 282, 2, 2, 1, 2, 8, 1, 3, 11, 17, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 10, 1, 5, 1, 69, 1, 5, 1, 10, 2, 5, 3, 2)*]
```



I have not much problems with this overlay design as long as it is clearly
stated and consistent.

Note that this behaviour is not uniform, since `CFF(a).value()` is sometimes not
equal to `a`, but this is not clear when.


```
- << Return the value of "self" (the number from which it was built). >>

- << Return the value of "self" as a quadratic number (with square free
  discriminant). >>
```


This is not the role of `CFF` to canonicalize Sage real numbers, though one
could imagine such a class/function `GoodRealField`.


```
sage: CFF(sqrt(2))
[1; (2)*]
sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value()
sqrt2

sage: CFF(0.1)
[0; 10]
sage: CFF(0.1).value()
1/10

sage: CFF(pi)
[3; 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...]
sage: CFF(pi).value()
pi

sage: (2^(1/3)).parent()           
Symbolic Ring
sage: CFF(2^(1/3)).value().parent()
Algebraic Real Field
```



Another consequence of the overlay structure is that the inverse of a
continued fraction is not as expected (the inverse should only shift the
sequence of partial quotients):


```
sage: a = CFF(pi+0.1) ; a
[3; 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 33, 4, 2, 6, 10, 3, 1, ...]
sage: ~a
[0; 3, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 33, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, ...]
```



I do understand that this may be a transitional behaviour. But how to tell
that to sage users ?

I see two ways:

- be always an "overlay field"
- restrict the code to words (cf your issue 6) you really handle (rationals
  and quadratic irrationals, corresponding to finite and ultimately periodic
  words) ?
 
Perhaps a solution is to have two very distinct classes (with conversions) ?

-----

Another issue is:


```
sage: CFF.is_exact()
True
```


I disagree with that statement, since there are approximate elements in CFF,
for example `CFF(pi+0.1)`.


-----


Problems with `SR`:

```
sage: sqrt(2) == QQbar(sqrt(2))          
True

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)) == CFF(QQbar(sqrt(2)))
Wait for a long time...

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value().parent()
Number Field in sqrt2 with defining polynomial x^2 - 2

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == CFF(QQbar(sqrt(2))).value()
False
```



Transitivity of equality:


```
sage: bool(CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == sqrt(2))
True

sage: bool(sqrt(2)) == sqrt(QQbar(2)) 
True

sage: CFF(sqrt(2)).value() == sqrt(QQbar(2))
False
```




----

in `_element_constructor_()`


```
 - ``nterms`` -- integer (optional)

??? is that an old remaining thing ?

 - ``check`` -- boolean (optional) -- whether or not we check the

"the" what ?
```


----

When you test whether an element of `SR` is a real number, you use `RIF(x)`.
Why not using `x.is_real()` (and make this method more reliable if needed) ?

----

Another problem:


```
sage: a = RDF(0.1)
sage: CFF(a)
[0]
```


The reason is :


```
sage: (1/RIF(RDF(0.1))).unique_floor()
ValueError: interval does not have a unique floor
```


----


In the doc: "It is quite remarkable that".

Add : "- any real number admits a unique continued fraction expansion"

----

"It is also possible to create a continued fraction from a list of digits::"

I would propose : "from a list of numbers corresponding to its partial
quotients."
 

"For quadratic numbers, the syntax is quite similar and the digits are
represented as a pair of tuples, the preperiod and the period::"

Again, "digits" vs "partial quotients"

-----

Another problem: 


```
sage: cf = CFF([(1,2,3),(1,2,4)]); cf.value()         
-1/86*sqrt229 + 139/86

sage: sqrt229
....
NameError: name 'sqrt229' is not defined
```



`CFF` outputs an element of a quadratic field that can not be used
furthermore.  Of course, one can get it back with `cf.parent().gen()`. Perhaps
inject those variables ?

----

"two_last_convergents" -> "last_two_convergents"

----

`_pn` and `_qn` looks good for internal variables, but i would suggest to
replace `pn()` and `qn()` methods by `numerator()` and `denominator()` to stay
consistent with rationals.

----

In the `_mpfr_` method: "It is guaranteed that the result is exact"

Floating point number are not exact, perhaps "accurate" is a better word ?

Replying to [comment:33 tmonteil]:

agreed. There is no transformation on input now. Most problem disappear. The only trouble might be with floating point as I decided to first convert the input into a rational. Note however that

```
sage: RR.random_element() in QQ
True
```

It is !

I do not want to make CFF inexact. The trouble comes from the unstability of CFF... If you want a friendly CFF you either have to rebuild the symbolic ring or do with it.

This is now removed

you can not believe in `is_real` but I used it.

It is now correct.

All occurrences of digits are removed and replaced by partial quotients.

I agree. It is quite hard to make it works. I only documented how to do

Hello,

I am still working on this.

Firstly, it is easy to implement a class for continued fractions given by an infinite expansion... so I propose to include it in that ticket.

Secondly, I have a big open question: what should be the parent (if any) of a continued fraction? As Thierry M. already mentioned, the `CFF` class does not fit very well.
