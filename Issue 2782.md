This should be an easy 1-2 line fix to change the urls that the links to docs pull up. 

I got bitten bigtime during my class today when showing how to use the doc search today, since the dynamic "live" docs are too slow.

I've decided against this.  Instead I added a prominent easy-to-find link to static docs in #2840.
