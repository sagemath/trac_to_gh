Travis, any comments? Decision for four point corner is artificial, I don't know what is most natural.

(Untested, now compiling. Milestone for 8.3 is not available yet, hence in wishlist-milestone.)

Was my error with git. Corrected.

Any comments about the definition of "neighbor"?

I would rather remove the "year" parameter.

Maybe add coordinates to vertices (at geographical center of states? or at capital's coordinates maybe)

Removed. I added it as a parallel to two other maps, but new states have not been added to USA for some time.

Something like that can be added later. I don't know if coordinates are needed, but instead some natural value for edge labels for neighbors. That could be usefull to demonstrate some function ("cheapest travel by rain from Nevada to..." as an example to `shortest_path` etc.) However I haven't figured out anything natural and constant enought.

ok, even if the usefulness of that kind of thing is very far from obvious to me
