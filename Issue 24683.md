On OpenSuSE with system readline several doctests in r.py get the additional line printed:
`    sh: /home/ralf/sage/local/lib/libreadline.so.6: no version information available (required by sh)`
which makes them fail.

Which doctests fail and precisely how do they fail?

Can #24919 fix this, possibly by checking for system readline at start of build?

Looks like R is somewhere setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when rendering docs. It shouldn't, we don't need nor want it. In particular, `sh` should just use the system libraries.

Debian and sage-on-gentoo now use https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/sagemath.git/tree/debian/patches/dt-r-no-readline.patch because R hangs with newer readline. I suspect it would also help here.

Cannot confirm. Still fails with that patch. In principle readline is already linked in R, so you may be able to switch off its usage, but the library is still loaded.
