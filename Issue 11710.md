Keywords: readline lion

readline 6.2 is available.  Upgrade Sage to use this version.  This also includes [a fix](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/readline/files/patch-shobj-conf.diff) so it builds on OS X 10.7 Lion.

New spkg available for testing:

s/`## Readline 6.1`/`## Readline 6.2`/ in `spkg-install`, or just remove the three lines.

More important,

```sh
  DYLIB_NAME="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libreadline.so.6.1  # Untested. David Kirkby, 11th November 2010 
```

should now be

```sh
  DYLIB_NAME="$SAGE_LOCAL"/lib/libreadline.so.6.2  # Untested. David Kirkby, 11th November 2010 
```


I guess the Arch Linux and OpenSUSE 11.x fixes are no longer necessary with readline 6.2, but unless *Sage* breaks (with the system's libreadline), we may keep them at the moment. In principle we should really check the versions and decide based on these.




We should only delete Sage's previous version upon a *successful* build.

----

If one day `make check` is supported, we *may* have to set up `CFLAGS` et al. in `spkg-check` as well. Perhaps add a comment on that.

----

## Optionally:

We should replace the ugly

```sh
if [ "x$CFLAG64" = x ] ; then
   CFLAG64=-m64
fi
```

by

```sh
: ${CFLAG64=-m64} # Only sets it to '-m64' if it's not set at all, not even to "".
```

which is shorter and faster (and maybe safer ;-) ); otherwise I'd use `[ -z "$CFLAG64" ]` or `[This is the Trac macro *-z $CFLAG64 * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#-z $CFLAG64 -macro)` (see below; we could use the latter also for `$SAGE_LOCAL`).

You could also use

```sh
   ...
   CFLAGS="$CFLAGS ${CFLAG64=-m64}"
   # The above *sets* CFLAG64 in case it is undefined,
   # so it's sufficient to use just $CFLAG64 in the following assignments.
   ...
```

and omit the whole `if [ -z "$CFLAG64" ] ...` (or whatever) block.





```sh
if [ "x$SAGE64" = xyes ] ; then
...
```

could be

```sh
if [ "${SAGE64:-no}" = yes ]; then
...
```

or, perhaps more readable, and even better, using the safe (and faster) shell built-in version of `test`:

```sh
if [[ $SAGE64 = yes ]]; then
...
```


(Same for `$SAGE_DEBUG`.)

----

"Naturally", I haven't yet tested the new spkg at all... (And I won't be able to test it on Lion and other strange OSs or Linux distributions either. ;-) )

Ok. By the way, this is also supported by MacOS X 10.4's outdated `bash` 2.04.

Jeroen should decide whether we can merge this without having tested it on some of the mentioned platforms.




Also someone who had problems with readline and R on Ubuntu 11.10 could test whether this fixes the issue; I'm not aware of any detailed report regarding that, and others did not have such problems when building Sage on Oneiric Ocelot.

Doesn't look like it would change anything regarding that, i.e., our current R spkg already properly configures R with `--with-readline=...`, prepends Sage's include directory to `CPPFLAGS` etc., and prepends `-L$SAGE_LOCAL/lib` to `LDFLAGS`.

I was just guessing that might have been the issue.

Regarding the build on Arch Linux, someone (h/t csousa) on the IRC pointed me to this:

[http://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/plain/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/sage-mathematics](http://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/plain/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/sage-mathematics)


```sh
...
build() {
  cd sage-${pkgver}

  # modularization of sage, sort of :)
  # fixes the following error:
  # bash: symbol lookup error: bash: undefined symbol: rl_filename_rewrite_hook
  # remove this hack when sage uses a readline 6.1 or greater, or when sage uses its own internal bash
  # this is for people who have custom kernels (sage works this around by checking uname -r)
  #mkdir -p spkg/installed
  #touch spkg/installed/readline-6.1
...
```


So readline 6.2 is likely to work as well, unless they meanwhile have an even newer version in Arch.

Thus we should change

```sh
if [ -f /etc/arch-release ]; then
    ...
fi
```

to


```sh
if false && [ -f /etc/arch-release ]; then
    ...
fi
```


Or leave the Arch Linux *detection* and just print a message that we're building Sage's readline since we assume it to work...

(I wouldn't delete the whole stuff yet.)

I'm considering modifying the spkg with the following patch:

Is this a good idea?

Jeroen: if I did this, would you be able to use a new version in 4.7.3.alpha0?

Or should I create a ".p1" version of the spkg with changes like these?

As you wish, .p0 or .p1 doesn't matter for me.

It is likely that we'll have to reenable the code (with slight changes) when Arch or SuSE again have newer versions (with new symbols), so I wouldn't delete it.

It could be smarter or more generic of course, but I wouldn't make such changes here and now.

In general I'd prefer a p1 to avoid confusion, but there are no changes to the code, and as long as its location is the same I won't mind having the changes made to the p0.

... so I'd change your suggested `SPKG.txt` phrase accordingly.

Also, *"When we add self-tests ..."* should read *"If **upstream** adds self-tests ..."*, since we already run `make check`, but that's currently a no-op.
