# Issue 17645: Cython clean-up in fast_eval.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17882

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-03-02 11:16:19

We remove the following line from `stdsage.pxi`:

```
ctypedef void PyObject
```


This requires fixing two Cython modules:
1. `src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_modn_dense_ntl.pyx`
2. `src/sage/ext/fast_eval.pyx`

The latter is actually the non-trivial part of this ticket.
