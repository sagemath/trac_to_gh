Keywords: modular forms gen_forms

In #31559, the Parent-Element framework was implemented for the class `ModularFormsRing`. However, there are still some inconsistencies in the code. For example:

```
sage: M = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5))
sage: A = M.gen_forms(); A
[1 + 12*q^2 + 12*q^3 + 12*q^4 + 12*q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 2*q^2 - q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q - 9*q^4 - 10*q^5 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Modular Forms space of dimension 2 for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) of weight 2 over Rational Field
```

(Notice that the parent of the list element is not a modular form **ring** object)

Instead, it would be preferable if the returned forms were instances of `GradedModularFormElement` (the element class of `ModularFormsRing`).

The goal of this ticket is to implement this behavior:

```
sage: A = ModularFormsRing(Gamma0(11), Zmod(5)).gen_forms(); A
[1 + 2*q^2 + 2*q^3 + 2*q^4 + 2*q^5 + O(q^6),
q + 3*q^2 + 4*q^3 + 2*q^4 + q^5 + O(q^6),
q + q^4 + O(q^6)]
sage: A[0].parent()
Ring of Modular Forms for Congruence Subgroup Gamma0(11) over Ring of integers modulo 5
```
