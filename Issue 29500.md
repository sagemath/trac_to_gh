# Issue 29500: Add L-polynomial to integral curves

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29737

Original creator: klee

Original creation time: 2020-05-26 04:54:02

We add two methods `L_polynomial()` and `number_of_rational_points()` to integral curves. These methods have already been with global function fields. The branch enables us to do


```
            sage; A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
            sage: C = Curve(y^2 - x^5 - x^4 - 2*x^3 - 2*x - 2)
            sage: Cbar = C.projective_closure()
            sage: Cbar.L_polynomial()
            9*t^4 - 3*t^3 + t^2 - t + 1  
```

and

```
            sage; A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
            sage: C = Curve(y^2 - x^5 - x^4 - 2*x^3 - 2*x - 2)
            sage: Cbar = C.projective_closure()
            sage: Cbar.number_of_rational_points(3)
            21
            sage: D = Cbar.change_ring(Cbar.base_ring().extension(3))
            sage: D.base_ring()
            Finite Field in z3 of size 3^3
            sage: len(D.closed_points())
            21 
```

Typo in both methods' examples:

```diff
-sage; A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
+sage: A.<x,y> = AffineSpace(GF(3), 2)
```

Once you fix these typos (please also double-check by running the tests on this file), then you can set a positive review on my behalf.

I had noticed the typos, but forgot to upload the commit. 

Done. Passed all the tests.

Thanks.
