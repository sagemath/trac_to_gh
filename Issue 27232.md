# Issue 27232: bug in is_norm for relative number field extensions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27469

Keywords: norms relative number fields

I wanted to know whether -7 was a relative norm from Q(zeta_24) to Q(zeta(8), which it is:

```
sage: L.<z24> = CyclotomicField(24)
sage: K.<z8> = L.subfield(z24^3)[0]
sage: K.is_isomorphic(CyclotomicField(8))
True
sage: K(-7).is_norm(L)
...
IndexError: the number of names must equal the number of generators
```


The error comes from the step where (since L is an absolute field, not a relative one) the code does

```
Lrel = L.relativize(K.hom(L), (L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0') )
```

which calls `normalize_names(1,(L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0'))` which raises the error, since the first parameter should be 2 (or -1).

A workaround is

```
sage: K(-7).is_norm(L.relativize(K.embeddings(L)[0],'c'), element=True)
(True,
 (149/343*z8^3 + 32260/2401*z8^2 + 100/2401*z8 + 39260/2401)*c - 8660/2401*z8^3 - 87/343*z8^2 - 50420/2401*z8 + 844/2401)
```

I have fixed the bug and added 2 doctests.

The new doctest for is_norm() hides one strange thing.  The line `c in L` gives True as expected.  Running this from the command line, the line `c.parent() is L` also gives True, and is the test I would have liked to include.  But when run as a doctest, that returns False and c.parent() displays the field K, not L.  I am completely mystified as to how that can be happening.  Perhaps something to do with number fields being stores as unique representations.

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

There's a trivial doctest output change needed after some previous change:

```
File "src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx", line 1631, in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement.is_norm
Failed example:
    K = L.subfield(z24^3, 'z8')[0]; K
Expected:
    Number Field in z8 with defining polynomial x^4 + 1
Got:
    Number Field in z8 with defining polynomial x^4 + 1 with z8 = 0.7071067811865475? + 0.7071067811865475?*I
```
