I fixed the issue by implementing the method `conjugate` of the class `FinitePolyExtElement`

Thank you Sebastian. Just keep cc-ing me on tickets to help get your cubic braid groups code into Sage (and/or emailing me if you have any questions).

Thanks Frédéric for catching that; mea culpa. Trivial fix so I am allowing myself to set back to a positive review.

It was my fault, as well. I run a doctest yesterday evening and I saw "all tests passed", but probably in the wrong window!

Concerning the cubic braid group there is just one unreviewed ticket left (#25894) for the moment. But I will soon produce some new ones an cc you on them!
Thanks for offering your help!
