You need to update to a more recent ATLAS (3.11.something), upstream worked hard to make it build on power8 relatively recently.

Haven't tried the branch yet but I have built it from ebuild on my machine. That being said my first attempt failed in the same way at the exact same point.

It got past once I set the ebuild to use threads which would have added `-t -1 -Si omp 0` to the build options. I also had `--use-ifko` enabled, it took ~3h30mn to build on my 12 cores machine.

I guess you mean *removed* functions, despite what LAPACK calls them. If they are not built by default, they are de facto removed, not deprecated.

I am going for the easy way out, which is using LAPACK 3.5.0 and SciPy 0.16.1 clean from upstream.

On my ppc64le machine, the score is now 2 successful builds out of 4 tries. The last time it failed with:

```

I'm afraid that this new ATLAS is full of random failures...

The reproducible build problem on `sagebu14_32s02` is fixed by using GCC 4.9.x instead of GCC 4.8.4.

Unfortunately, there are still doctest failures:

These are testing that multiplying a matrix over a finite field with the zero or identity matrix work as expected.

Fixed by installing Sage's GCC 4.9.3.
