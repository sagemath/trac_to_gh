# Issue 24416: Implement _unicode_art_ for crystals

We can take advantage of constructing barred letters via unicode and so the tableaux crystals do not behave differently from tableaux.

`@`chapoton, `@`embray, `@`jdemeyer I cc-ed you on this and #24652 to make sure I am being no-worse Python3 compatible (or at least so 2to3 can easily work).

This isn't going to work on Python 3 (and we're not using 2to3).  Let me take a closer look and see if I can make some more useful suggestions for how to do it right.

I think maybe this will be fine if you just replace all the `unicode()` calls with `six.text_type()`.  I'm going to go ahead and try that and see if you tests work.

Do you have a verdict on this?


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-02-06 10:34:23

I still need to test it on Python 3.  Works on Python 2 (after all, `six.text_type` is just an alias for `unicode` there).  Will do that now.

Actually, I'm mistaken again.  More of this is Cython code than I first realized, so it may be fine as-is.

Okay there's just one place in `sage.combinat.tableau` where you need to fix this, plus my comments on #24652

Fixed.

Basically none of those apply here since it is all handled via the `unicode_art` or in #24652.

Thank you for taking a look at this and #24652 too.

Hmm, annoyingly I had to add to `CharacterArt`:


```python
def __format__(self, fmt):
    return format(str(self), fmt)
```


and similarly to `UnicodeCharacterArt`:


```python
def __format__(self, fmt):
    return format(text_type(self), fmt)
```


or else I would get failures like:


```

        l2 += u"{} {:^{width}} ".format(v, e, width=w)
    TypeError: unsupported format string passed to UnicodeArt.__format__
```


So I guess add that, and a small docstring.

To be clear, with that addition everything you added here worked on Python 3.

Try this. I think this should work since `CharacterArt` is an ABC and `_string_type` will be set to the appropriate thing by the appropriate subclass.


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-02-07 18:30:09

Well, it's not actually an ABC...


---

Comment by embray created at 2018-02-07 18:33:16

Ah okay, for some reason I didn't realize there was a separate `AsciiArt` class in addition to `CharacterArt` (nice sample art in that file btw).  Yes, I think this should work fine, and much nicer than my suggestion.
