Keywords: relative number field pari

We should use the PARI functions wrapped in #18739 to avoid initialisation of PARI `rnf` structures when only doing simple arithmetic in relative number fields.

Summary of changes:
- new method `NumberFieldElement._pari_polynomial`;
- replace the method `_pari_rnfequation` of `NumberField_relative` by `_pari_rnfeq`, which calls the PARI function `nf_rnfeq` (which returns slightly more information than `rnfequation`);
- replace `K.pari_rnf().rnfeltreltoabs(x)` by `K._pari_rnfeq().eltreltoabs(x)` and similar;
- remove the misleadingly named (and now obsolete) method `NumberField_relative._rnfeltreltoabs`, which only did something meaningful for elements in the base field;
- merge `NumberField_relative.pari_polynomial` into `NumberField_generic.pari_polynomial`.

Hello Peter,

Instead of

```
f = pari(self._coefficients()).Polrev()
return f.change_variable_name(name)
```

you can do

```
return pari(self._coefficients()).Polrev(name)
```

that would avoid a copy.

Why did you rename `_rnf_equations` into `_rnfeq`. I understand that `relative_number_field_equations` is a bit long but the Sage standard is more toward no abbreviation at all. Is the name `rnfeq` standard in PARI/GP?

Vincent

OK, I will change this.

I agree that your way is better.
