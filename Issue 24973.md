# Issue 24973: Add option to make QQbar / AA print using radicals

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @BrentBaccala

Original creation time: 2018-04-19 03:34:57

Keywords: AlgebraicField, QQbar, AA

Add an option to make elements in QQbar / AA print using radical format:


```
sage: AA(19).sqrt()
4.358898943540674?
sage: QQbar.zeta(6)
0.500000000000000? + 0.866025403784439?*I

sage: AA.options.display_format = 'radical'

sage: AA(19).sqrt()
sqrt(19)
sage: QQbar.zeta(6)
1/2*I*sqrt(3) + 1/2
```

The patch adds a GlobalOption to the AlgebraicField class allowing the display format to be toggled in the manner shown.

I think you do not need this line anymore:

```
 from sage.symbolic.ring import SR # Lazy to avoid cyclic dependency
```

Other than that, I get All tests passed on my machine on top of rc3. Thanks for this contribution. I will put `AA.options.display_format = 'radical'` in my `init.sage`.
