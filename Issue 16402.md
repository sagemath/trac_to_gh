Keywords: beginner

Dive into Python has not been at its old address for quite some time, but [the tutorial](http://sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/bibliography.html#pyt) says it still is.  Fix this.  (Also make sure the translations are correct.)

This was first reported [here](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/23309/introduction-sage-tutorial-v62-hyperlink-to-dive-is-not-working/).
