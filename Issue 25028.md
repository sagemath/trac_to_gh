Keywords: discriminant, multivariate polynomial

Sage can't currently compute discriminants for polynomial rings over QQbar.

The attached patch moves the multivariate polynomial discriminant method from multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx to multi_polynomial.pyx.

The code doesn't depend on any Singular functions, so it's just a cut-and-paste operation that makes the method available to any multivariate polynomial that implements `coefficient`, `degree`, `derivative`, and `resultant`.

Now this works:


```
sage: R.<x,y> = QQbar[]
sage: f = x^2+y^2-1
sage: f.discriminant(y)
(-4)*x^2 + 4
```
