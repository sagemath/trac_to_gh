These are all okay with me. I am very slightly worried about the `Factorization.__pow__`, but I doubt anyone is calling that in a sufficiently tight loop for the import to affect that, unless you are calling `x^0` or `x^1` a lot with `x` being a factorization. So it is probably fine.

Green patchbot => positive review.

this pyflakes warning looks like an actual bug to me (not from changes on this ticket)

```
src/sage/categories/finite_dimensional_algebras_with_basis.py:1449:29 undefined name 'x'
```

... that should be fixed on another ticket.
