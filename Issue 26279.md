Keywords: libgap sig_on_count

When running doctests in my applications of libgap, sig_on_count reveals problems.

Indeed, in `src/sage/libs/gap/*`, one often sees constructions like the following:

```python
        try:
            sig_on()
            result = libGAP_EQ(self.value, c_other.value)
            sig_off()
        except RuntimeError as msg:
            raise ValueError('libGAP: cannot compare equality: '+str(msg))
        finally:
            libgap_exit()
...
        try:
            libgap_enter()
            sig_on()
            result = libGAP_SUM(self.value, (<GapElement>right).value)
            sig_off()
        except RuntimeError as msg:
            libGAP_ClearError()
            raise ValueError('libGAP: '+str(msg))
        finally:
            libgap_exit()
...
```

So, sig_off() is only called when no error is raised. But in my applications, I am in fact catching errors raised by libgap. So, maybe it is no surprise that the sig_on/sig_off count got wrong.

Proposed fix: move the sig_off() call to the "finally" clause, directly before libgap_exit()

No, that `finally` is meant for `libgap_exit`. So you need a nested `try`/`finally`:

```
try:
    sig_on()
    try:
        ...
    finally:
        sig_off
finally:
    libgap_exit()
```

or something like that.

Right. I use "libgap" synonymous to SageMath's libgap wrapper.

Anyway, I am doing things like this:

```
    try:
        G = G.MinimalGeneratingSet().Group()
    except (RuntimeError, ValueError):
        G = G.SmallGeneratingSet().Group()
```

For some of my groups, the attempt to compute a minimal generating set fails, and if I understand correctly, the libgap wrapper would call sig_on(), then kindly ask libgap to compute the minimal generating set, and when this fails would not call sig_off() before raising a Python error.

EDIT: I tested and found that *this* is not giving a sig_on_count() failure. But I am now going through the actual tests of my applications and will hopefully be able to create a minimal example.

Currently, my smallest example triggering sig_on_count to complain is an example in which another library results in an error in an example that previously worked. So, very likely the wrong sig_on/off count comes from there, not from libgap.

Technical question about sig_on/sig_off, sig_check, and sig_error.

Assume that in the error handler of the libmtx wrapper I call sig_error, similar to what is done in the case of libgap. Would it be needed to henceforth only use sig_on/sig_off, but not sig_check? Namely, when calling sig_error, it is required that sig_on has been called before.

And if that's really the case, then maybe it would be good to know about the use cases of the different sig_* functions. So far, I thought it is like this:
- Use sig_on/sig_off arount a library call that potentially takes a long time.
- Use sig_check when there is a tight loop involving library calls, as that's faster than sig_on/sig_off.
- I didn't know at all about sig_error.

So, is it really the case that I have to accept the slow-down that comes from being forced to use sig_on/off instead of sig_check?

In any case, I realised that I need to go through matrix_gfpn_dense, as there are many library calls that are in fact not wrapped into sig_on/off pairs.

Absolutely.

That's more or less correct.

> - I didn't know at all about sig_error.

`sig_error` is quite specialized to handle errors from a C library in a callback. But for SharedMeatAxe, this doesn't seem to be needed since it has a way to deal with errors already.

Conclusion: the best solution is probably to wrap errors from SharedMeatAxe as

```
sig_on()
try:
    # MeatAxe call which might raise a Python exception
finally:
    sig_off()
```

Actually, a more important reason is not so much that it's faster but safer too. `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` is really "use this only when you really know what you are doing" while `sig_check()` is pretty foolproof.

In SharedMeatAxe, in contrast to MeatAxe, I am consequently propagating error values, so that a program calling a library function can take proper action when an error occurs. MeatAxe does make it possible to have a custom error handler, which I am using here of course.

Maybe I am misunderstanding the role of sig_*. Namely, the library functions have an error return value, and Cython knows about it (it is declared in the .pxd files). So, a Python error is raised regardless whether sig_on/sig_off is involved or not.

Is it correct that the only added bonus of using sig_on/sig_off is that the user can interrupt with ctrl-c?

OK, in that case I should use

```
sig_on()
try:
    <library call>
finally:
    sig_off()
```

only for functions that potentially run long enough so that it makes sense for them being interruptible.

Is it ok if Python stuff happens between sig_on and sig_off, such as

```python
        try:
            mat = MatAlloc(self.Data.Field, self._nrows, right._ncols)
            MatMulStrassen(mat, self.Data, right.Data)
            return new_mtx(mat, self)
        finally:
            sig_off()
```

?

Or should, in particular, return statements happen *after* the `finally: sig_off()'?

You should try hard to avoid that as it's unsafe.

> Or should, in particular, return statements happen *after* the `finally: sig_off()'?

There is nothing in particular about `return` statements. There just shouldn't be any kind of Python object manipulation (especially no creation of new Python objects).

Good, then I guess the following is bad, as `new_mtx` creates a python object (namely: a !Matrix_gfpn_dense):

```python
        sig_on()
        try:
            mat = MatAlloc(self.Data.Field, self.Data.Nor+other.Data.Nor, self.Data.Noc)
            memcpy(mat.Data, self.Data.Data, FfCurrentRowSize*self.Data.Nor)
            memcpy(MatGetPtr(mat, self.Data.Nor), other.Data.Data, FfCurrentRowSize*other.Data.Nor)
            return new_mtx(mat, self)
        finally:
            sig_off()
```
