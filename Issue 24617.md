One thing Sage desperately needs is a "short" test suite for quick smoke tests--maybe not achieving quite as high coverage but still a lot.

Actually what we really need is better (any) coverage analysis.  That's something that's been high on my TODO list (among other things high on that list), and is probably a bit challenging to get working right.

Something you can remind me about `--short`: Does it randomize the order the order or otherwise somehow cycle the order in which the tests were run?

I was also thinking maybe it would help, for advisory test runs, to have a few other heuristics, such as definitely run the tests in any files that were modified by a commit.  It's also reasonably easy most of the time to build a graph of other modules that depend on the modified modules, and maybe walk that graph breadth-first.

Just some thoughts as to how to minimize the number of tests run, while still catching the majority (though certainly not all) failures.

No, except for variations in timing which make the system run more or less doctest, this is deterministic.

> I was also thinking maybe it would help, for advisory test runs, to have a few other heuristics, such as definitely run the tests in any files that were modified by a commit.

Yes, I already run --new. A dependency graph would be awesome of course and much more relevant.
