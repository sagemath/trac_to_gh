The following code is broken:


```
sage: P1.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: P2.<u,v,w> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: H = Hom(P2,P1)
sage: f = H([u*w, v^2 + w^2])
sage: f.dehomogenize((2,1))
# raises IndexError
```


This seems to be because of a typo in projective_morphism.py, in the dehomogenization method. The method uses the domain to find the number of generators of the input, when it should be using the domain.
