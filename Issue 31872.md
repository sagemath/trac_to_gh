This looks good to me. You can set this to positive if the bot is happy.

I think you need to add the trac ticket number in the doctest, e.g. add the sentence:

```
    We check that :trac:`32109` is fixed::
```

before the test.

Otherwise, it looks good.

I think this is usually done for bugs that include a discussion, which is not the case here. But sure.
