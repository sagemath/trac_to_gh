Shouldn't `varname_cmp(self,x,y)` be deprecated for some time before removing it?

This seems to be OK, tests passed and maybe I could give a positive review.

But is this meant to be auxiliarity function only? If so, why it's name does not begin with `_`?

I don't know if deprecation is even needed, but it don't hurt.

Feel free to mark as _positive_review_ if you think that underscore prefix at function name is not needed. But if you change it, remember to change also deprecation warning to point the new one.

Thanks Jori. I will keep this ticket as it is, because py3 is still a long way ahead
and I want to advance.
