Shouldn't `varname_cmp(self,x,y)` be deprecated for some time before removing it?

This seems to be OK, tests passed and maybe I could give a positive review.

But is this meant to be auxiliarity function only? If so, why it's name does not begin with `_`?

I don't know if deprecation is even needed, but it don't hurt.
