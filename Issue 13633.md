# Issue 13633: trivial typo in modular/modsym/ambient.py (in modular symbols)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: was

Original creation time: 2012-12-16 19:54:31

Assignee: davidloeffler

Keywords: beginner

I noticed:

```
        Uses Heilbronn-Cremonma matrices of `p` is prime, else use
        Heilbronn-Merel matrices.
```

It should be "if `p` is prime" not "of `p` is prime".

The attached patch also replaces some deprecated python syntax.

We should probably also correct the other typo in that sentence ("Cremonma"). The patchbot seems unhappy, but I can't believe that the failure has anything to do with your patch!

I cannot reproduce this. With `mercurial` on Archlinux I get

```
$ hg qimport -P http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/13837/trac_13837.patch
Füge trac_13837.patch zur Seriendatei hinzu
Wende trac_13837.patch an
jetzt bei: trac_13837.patch
```


Why hasn't this happened with other patches of mine, for example that one attached to #13815?
Any suggestions how to fix this?

I have brutally removed the accent from Andre's name and uploaded a new patch. Sorry, Andre, but I thought you'd prefer this to your patch sitting in limbo any longer.
