the code in comment:20 depends upon the ordering produced by `G.relabel()` ? 
How do we know that number of a vertex `u` corresponds naturally to the binary representation
of the number `u`, this is more of a luck that it does.

I propose to do optimisation on a followup ticket, and just fix the typo here.

Right, I have to improve the mapping from binary representation to int, and the optimization can be done later.
