Actually I realised that I would like to have some design changes.

In principle, so that this is easier to do experiments with, it should be easy to modify the cipher. I have something in mind like the following:


```
sage: cipher = PRESENT(rounds=1, doLastLinearLayer=False)
sage: cipher.sbox = SBox(range(16))
sage: cipher.key_schedule = lambda x: [0, 0]  # return the 0 keys as round keys
sage: cipher.encrypt(plain=0x1234, key=0x0) == 0x1234
True
```


So this would require the implementation to split the encrypt function into a `round` function that uses an `sboxlayer` function and a `linearlayer` function, the `sboxlayer` uses the member variable `sbox`. All these should not be internal functions, but visible and documented, so that the user knows about them and that it is possible to modify them.

I hope this is clear, otherwise I can specify this further.

OK, LGTM with one last point:

If you do the following import in an example


```
sage: from sage.crypto.block_cipher.present import _convert_to_vector
```


I think the `_convert_to_vector` function should not be hidden by default.

However, I have problems building the documentation, it fails with some error in the `categorie` docs -- which should actually not be related to this ticket? Maybe we should merge the latest development branch, for which I am able to build the documentation.
