Use `SAGE_DEBUG` instead of the new and undocumented environment variable `SINGULAR_XALLOC`.

Also, building the Sage library with `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` is broken. This is because distutils then does not define `NDEBUG` which turns on broken Singular debugging stuff.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13876
