CC:  @defeo @JohnCremona

There are various places in the elliptic-curve code where we could reuse known information about curve and point orders:

- Isogeny codomains (Tate's theorem).
- Base-field extensions.
- Scalar multiplications (Lagrange's theorem).
- Possibly images of points under isogenies, but this is trickier (it requires `order_from_multiple` in general).

Moreover, `EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field` currently *uses* its `_order` attribute whenever present, but the `.order()` method fails to actively cache `_order` after it's been computed.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32786

Hmm...it seems like the action is implemented in a different way (the base class `_acted_upon_()` is the trivial one that returns `None`). Okay then, how about we directly get the action and use that:

```
Q = self.parent().get_action(ZZ, self_on_left=False)._act_(k, self)
```

This is more future proof in case a specialized action gets implemented (although it is effectively the same code).
