# Issue 29781: Can't deepcopy expression containing function

When I deepcopy expression containing function, a segmentation fault occurred.


```
sage: var('t');
sage: x = function('x')(t);
sage: l = [[x(t) == 1]];
sage: l
[[x(t) == 1]]
sage: l2 = deepcopy(l);
sage: l2

Is this known issue?

allows to fix the issue, but I don't know if this is a desirable fix. Maybe something else is better to do when the copy is done instead. But I don't know where this is done.

Thanks for your comment.\\
But it doesn't seem to work in my environment.

```
sage: var('t');
sage: x = function('x')(t);
sage: l = [[x(t) == 1]];
sage: l2 = deepcopy(l);
sage: l2

I noticed that the file is in Cython and tried to make it, but it failed.

Maybe it depends on the way you installed sage. For example, if you installed sage from a binary download, you may not have all the tools to compile such changes... The README of Sage gives information on the prerequisite necessary to compile sage.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage

still broken in 9.5.beta0; #32480 will fix it

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2021-09-06 06:05:00

Changing priority from major to critical.

However, the underlying issue is that unpickling gives a segfault -- this needs to be fixed.

Let me just point out (re: the title) the detail that the segfault occurs when printing/`repr`ing, e.g.


```
f = loads(dumps(function('f')(x)))
```


or


```
f = deepcopy(function('f')(x))
```


does not segfault, it is the printing of the (badly) (un)pickled/copied object that segfaults.
