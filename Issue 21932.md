# Issue 21932: flint 2.5.2.p0 build failure on Cygwin 32-bit

Keywords: windows cygwin flint ntl

I'm starting to work on getting Sage working on 32-bit Cygwin again (64-bit is basically working minus a few unmerged patches).

The build fails while building flint (though it looks not unlikely to have something to do with NTL as well).  I don't know what any of it means yet.  See attached build log.

Haven't fully tested yet, but i think adding `-std=gnu++98` to the `CXXFLAGS` should work around it, a la #20381.

Yes, that seems to have done the trick.
