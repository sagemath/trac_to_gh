This is a followup to #29490.

We now add code rejecting Brial 1.2.5 - provided it can
be recognised from `VERSION` macro in `polybory/config.h` header.
This identifies standard Brial on Fedora 30 (and possibly elsewhere, but tough luck then).


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29792
