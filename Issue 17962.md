# Issue 17962: sage.geometry.polyhedron should have an lrs backend

Sage already has lrs as an optional package.

For higher-dimensional polytopes, computing vertices by lrs is often much faster than the implementations of the double description method in cddlib and ppl. 

Sage should have a backend_lrs.py to make use of the existing lrs package.

As has been said in these discussions, lrs also has a key benefit that it can generate the vertices as a stream, with very little memory use. Ideally, this feature could be exposed using Python generators. However, this would seem to require extending the Polyhedron interface.

I may have time to work on this in a couple of weeks.
