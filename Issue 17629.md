For testing purposes it would be great to somehow get a list containing tuples with
 * the Function operator
 * nargs
 * name
 * a tuple with example args

Good idea! But what are you thinking: writing it down by hand or just parsing the source code?

Apparently on startup all symbolic functions get registered in the Pynac symbol table.

EDIT: This list includes even the numerical ones.

For example,

```
sage: def builtin_symbolic_function_list():     
        from sage.symbolic.pynac import symbol_table
        from sage.symbolic.function import BuiltinFunction
        fdict = symbol_table['functions']
        return ([c for c in fdict.itervalues()
            if isinstance(c, BuiltinFunction) ])
sage: for c in builtin_symbolic_function_list():
    argl = []
    for n in range(c.number_of_arguments()):
        argl.append(2.5)
    print c
    print(CC(c(*argl)))
```

This allowed me to quickly find that `elliptic_e(2.5,2.5)` which should give `0.535648... +1.63996... i` according to Wolfram, throws an ECL error (fixed in #15046).
