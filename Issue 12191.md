Two quick comments:

- the linked gzipped tar file is missing the 'data' directory, which causes some doctests to fail.  (This caused me a lot of confusion on #12315.)
- your spkg file is huge!

In principle this looks okay and it works on a few different machines.  Skynet seems to be down right now, so I can't test it on a very wide range of platforms, though.

It seems to work now.  Anyway, I already tested this on most of the Skynet machines and once it's merged it will be tested again before the release.

Regarding the doctest patch, can you explain mathematically why this is the right thing to do?

Let K be the number field **Q**[y]/(y<sup>2</sup> + y + 1).

Let L be the relative number field K[x]/(x<sup>4</sup> + y*x + 2).

We can also write L = {**Q**[y]/(y<sup>2</sup> + y + 1)}[x]/(x<sup>4</sup> + y*x + 2) (braces added for clarity).

Now consider the element x*y in L, we ask for its relative representation in PARI.  Given the above, the correct answer is

```
Mod(Mod(y, y^2 + y + 1)*x, x^4 + y*x + 2)
```


So, the new answer to the doctest is more correct than the old.
