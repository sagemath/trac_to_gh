As of 8.7beta6, this works fine (note change from `adjoint` to `adjugate` as per #10501):

```
sage: R.<t> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: M = t*identity_matrix(2)
sage: M.adjugate() * ~M.det()
[t^-1    0]
[   0 t^-1]
```

but this fails:

```
sage: ~M ## Shorthand for M.inverse(), which behaves the same way
