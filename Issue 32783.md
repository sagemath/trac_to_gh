This new standard package contains precompiled binaries, which are dynamically linked to a particular libc.

In particular this causes some problems building sage with the musl libc.

AFAICT, this was added in #31280 just because it was a new dependency for ipykernel.

OTOH, debugpy was made optional in https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/pull/767 and this is included in ipykernel 6.4.0 and up (current version 6.6.0).

Is it possible to
- either upgrade ipykernel or add the patch to make debugpy optional;
- and then either remove or make optional debugpy in sagemath
before 9.5, please?

It is strange that `ipykernel` still declares the dependency on `debugpy` as an `install_requires` (https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/main/setup.py#L66).
