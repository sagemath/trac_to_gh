This new standard package contains precompiled binaries, which are dynamically linked to a particular libc.

In particular this causes some problems building sage with the musl libc.

AFAICT, this was added in #31280 just because it was a new dependency for ipykernel.

OTOH, debugpy was made optional in https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/pull/767 and this is included in ipykernel 6.4.0 and up (current version 6.6.0).

Is it possible to
- either upgrade ipykernel or add the patch to make debugpy optional;
- and then either remove or make optional debugpy in sagemath
before 9.5, please?

It is strange that `ipykernel` still declares the dependency on `debugpy` as an `install_requires` (https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/main/setup.py#L66).

Note arch pkg for debugpy removes all these precompiled libs and compiles the one for linux 64 bit (see https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/blob/packages/python-debugpy/trunk/PKGBUILD).

It doesn't even seem difficult, as it is a single file. However, making sure this works for all supported architectures may be nontrivial, but otoh I expect the current package doesn't really work in all supported architectures anyway.

That commit works for me, it includes updating ipykernel to 6.6.0 and patching out setup.py and pyproject.toml.

If you prefer to stay at 6.3.1 and add PR 767 as a patch, that'd be easy to do (I was already testing this when I saw your comment).
