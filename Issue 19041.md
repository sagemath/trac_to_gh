A first version of the Hopf algebra of Malvenuto-Reutenauer.

This ticket provides several bases and the product and the coproduct. 
Other operators should be provided in others tickets (bidendriform, inner product, scalar product, polynomial realizations, etc).

Those tickets should be create soon (the tickets number should be inventoried here).

```
sage: F = FQSym(QQ).F()
sage: F[3,1,2] * F[1,2]
F[3, 1, 2, 4, 5] + F[3, 1, 4, 2, 5] + F[3, 1, 4, 5, 2] + F[3, 4, 1, 2, 5] + F[3, 4, 1, 5, 2] + F[3, 4, 5, 1, 2] + F[4, 3, 1, 2, 5] + F[4, 3, 1, 5, 2] + F[4, 3, 5, 1, 2] + F[4, 5, 3, 1, 2]

sage: F[3,1,2].coproduct()
F[] # F[3, 1, 2] + F[1] # F[1, 2] + F[2, 1] # F[1] + F[3, 1, 2] # F[]
```

Ah. Well, it isn't fully duplicate, since it implements several bases we don't have, and also implements dendriform *co*products. But I don't think I will have time to catch up on this in foreseeable time. And I am not sure how much of this ticket we can reuse, seeing that the code isn't very... polished.
