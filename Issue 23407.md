Now it prints:

```
sage: sage: k.<a> = GF(11^5)
....: sage: R.<t> = k[]
....: sage: R.<x> = R.fraction_field()[]
....: sage: f = x^4 + 1/(a*t)
....: sage: f._singular_()
....:

The ticket number shown should be 17696 rather than 23644.  Other than that, looks good.

p.s. Julian, would you please use shorter branch names next time, to long branch names render really awkward on trac.

Looks good.

As for the branch name, the default name comes from the title of the ticket, so you can blame `git trac`.

Ok I blamed `git-trac`  at [GitHub issue 27](https://github.com/sagemath/git-trac-command/issues/27)
