In the ["install from source code" documentation](http://sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html), there are some information on how to build Sage with SSL support. However it is somehow hidden in sage-notebook-specific sections, while SSL is also required to let ipython-notebook and pip work. Let us refactor this.
