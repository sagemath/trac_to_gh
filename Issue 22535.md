# Issue 22535: Matplotlib: don't write ascii as binary in make-setup-config.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22772

Original creator: jhpalmieri

Original creation time: 2017-04-07 05:42:54

Sage's script make-setup-config.py, used in installing matplotlib, writes an ascii file as binary. This is not a good idea, and can lead to trouble when building matplotlib with python 3 on OS X.

Ha, this is a sage specific file! I was wondering why I couldn't see anything in my build logs for the gentoo package. Jeroen would make you bump the version but I am happy to let it go.
