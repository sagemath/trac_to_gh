Wow! Great! Thanks a lot!

I am finishing my Habilitation this week... But, as a reward, next week, I wanted to update the procedure to make it even more user-friendly inside of the polyhedron object (and fix around a bit the generated tikz code)... It has been on my wishlist for a while and I'll make myself happy by stopping work and coding this!

This ticket would be a great follow-up to this one.
