Good suggestion! I tried it and confirmed it worked as well. Changed the docs accordingly now.

sage-conf etc are still not working, since they seem to respect neither prefix nor build dir. But that's something for another ticket.

No. `--prefix` sets the `SAGE_LOCAL` directory. You can delete everything but this directory and have a working Sage.

Its subdirectory, `SAGE_LOCAL/var/tmp/sage/build` is used for temporary files during the build.

What I am saying is, we should give users on WSL the advice to create the installation hierarchy (`SAGE_LOCAL`) in a WSL directory, not a /mnt directory.
This should be general advice for from source installs in WSL; not troubleshooting advice ("how to fix a problem").

I understood this, but thought I edited the "developer" guide where you would treat this as only as a semi-temporary build output and not as a valid installation that you try to keep. Will change that later.

I've now added a recommendation to put the source files in the linux file system so that the error doesn't occur in the first place. However, WSL has a few limitations and performance problems if you try to access files across the Windows <> Linux bridge; thus in some cases you might still prefer to put the files under the windows file system. In this case the workaround is still necessary. 

Also I've changed the workaround back to use use `SAGE_BUILD_DIR` as setting the prefix slowed down the build process considerably and had other issues.
