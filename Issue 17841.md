`cmake` has a test-suite run with `make test`. So a `spkg-check` file should be added to run this.

One more remark: you don't really need to split up `$MAKE` and `$MAKE install` in two steps, just `$MAKE install` is sufficient.

My experience with kitware stuff on OS X is they assume `clang` and most other stuff is in the too hard basket.

Current error is while building internal version of `curl` which is of course available by default on OS X. But using the system curl just push the problem further away. Attentive people will notice that the problematic header is the one we copy and modify for gcc install on 10.10.

I hate to do that, but my suggestion is for this to set `CC=clang CXX=clang++` on OS X.

I won't be surprised if this cmake won't be useful within Sage, as it might assume too much of the native OSX toolchain.

cmake was mentioned by me in a GSoC 2015 discussion regarding getting CSymPy into Sage; I expressed my doubts that cmake, which is used to configure CSymPy, is easy to deal with in Sage, based on some vague memories about cmake/Sage difficulties I saw. Now I recall that that was about building   cmake in Sage on OSX.

I don't think there is a difficulty per see in using `cmake` on OS X. The trouble building `cmake` and in fact `gcc` and in turn a bunch of other stuff is solely the fault of apple pushing its own stuff and not caring. `gcc` is currently slightly broken on OS X and unless the `gcc` team gets something together it will just get worse. Not being able to build `cmake` is just one of the many symptoms of `gcc` cracking while apple is pushing hard.

I know. Although I have been trying very hard to think about fortran code in sage apart from lapack. I think the only fortran bits where you need a fortran compiler are in atlas, scipy and unfortunately for OS X: R.

We use the accelerate framework instead of Atlas on OS X, one less fortran thing.

A fortran compiler is needed while compiling scipy :( lots of fortran code in there.  

R is more pernicious, you need a fortran compiler on OS X because there is a bug preventing us to use accelerate. 

flang is just a dot on the horizon so far. At least they say they started work on it.

I don't even see dots, apart from some github repos untouched since 2013 or so.

We can consider going back to having a dedicated gfortran package, as it used to be the case before OSX 10.7 (IIRC) broken xcode trouble started, but otherwise use xcode's compilers.

Thanks for trying to compile cmake.

A few comments:

* if csympy is the only package that requires cmake and cmake is impossible to build, we can also support an alternative build system in csympy

* I really like cmake, so let me try to fix these issues first, as I would prefer to keep cmake as the build system (but it needs to reliably build on OS X, both with clang and with gcc)

* I independently discovered lots of similar issues with building cmake with gcc on OS X 10.10 (https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack/issues/746), and just like you noticed, it builds fine with the native clang. As you can see, you can easily tell cmake not to compile in various things and rather reuse them from the system or Sage. I really believe all these issues can be fixed and I am also sure Kitware is itself interested in cmake being able to build, e.g. Robert Maynard from Kitware already commented on my issue above with some tips.

So I will have a look in the coming days and I will update this issue.
