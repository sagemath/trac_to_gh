# Issue 25393: 'some_elements()` is broken for ExteriorAlgebra

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25630

```
sage: E.<x,y,z> = ExteriorAlgebra(QQ)
sage: E.some_elements()
[x^y + 2*x + 3*y + 1]
```

`x^y` doesn't make any sense.

`^` is 1337 ASCII Art for wedge product.

That's incredibly stupid notation, IMHO. Or maybe we can find something even more ambiguous?

This also doesn't allow a user to cut-and-paste output and use it as input.

Why isn't there an antipode defined for exterior algebra elements?

Edit: never mind, this is fixed by #25603.

I'm not a big fan of the `^` convention, and I wouldn't mind changing it. (That said, this isn't the only case output doesn't work as input.)

But sorry for missing the coproduct muck-up :/

IMO, this is not a good argument as we do not generally have this (almost any `Parent` falls into this).

Having `^` is much closer to a wedge product, which is the common math notation, and technically, that should be bitwise or, so `2^3 == 8` is also technically ambiguous. (However, that is not meant to be a real counterargument as `^` is semantically exponentiation in Sage.)

So I can understand where the confusion comes from. If you want to change it to `x*y`, then I can accept that (the other ascii art version would be `x/\y`).

Unrelated, this made me come across a missing feature of a good `ascii_art` and `unicode_art` for the exterior algebra.

Either `x*y` or `x/\y` would be better, I think.

It is _a_ common math notation, but often when I see exterior algebras used in real life, I just see `xy` for the product of `x` and `y`.

Changing priority from major to trivial.

I propose changing `x^y` to `x/\y`, and also adding ascii art which uses `^`: if someone explicitly asks for ascii art, I hope they will not be misled by the carat in the notation.

Since `^` is so common for "action on the right" (which a wedge product between vectors definitely isn't), I'd say even for Ascii art, using `^` for wedge is a bad idea. It's just too common to consider some wedge space as a left-G-module for some group (e.g., a Galois group).

I can use `/\` for ascii art, too.

I think `/\` for ascii art is good, but for the standard output, I am more inclined to have `*`. I feel it is less heavy-handed in the output, there is the benefit of copy/pasting output as input, and it "fits" the other common notation of just standard multiplication.
