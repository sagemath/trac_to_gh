the class group iterator takes evey element in turn, and computes the product of the g^i's. Sure powers are computed by repeated squaring, but for iterators this is suboptimal.

On my laptop, from this situation...


```

sage: K.<v>=NumberField(x^4 + 514*x^2 + 64321)
sage: OK=K.maximal_order()
sage: G=K.class_group()                        
sage: time _=G.list()
CPU times: user 2.48 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 2.53 s
Wall time: 2.53 s

```


the attached patch improves to...


```

sage: K.<v>=NumberField(x^4 + 514*x^2 + 64321)
sage: OK=K.maximal_order()
sage: G=K.class_group()                        
sage: time _=G.list()
CPU times: user 0.45 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.45 s
Wall time: 0.44 s

```


which is a tad better.

doctest included (actually the previous doctest wasn't doing much, this one is slightly more thorough).

Note: while the code would work for any abelian group, I believe it makes sense only when the group operation is sufficiently non-trivial.

I think it just hasn't been reviewed by anyone.

Hi David,

This is unchanged from Emmanuel's patch, but I can simplify it in a new version. Also, it has been brought to my attention (by you and J. Cremona) that Pari produces the generators for the class group in a different order depending on the implementation. The given doctests were tested on my 32-bit system running sage 5.11b3; someone (probably me given time) will need to test this on a 64-bit system and put in the relevant doc test.

Hi.

Thanks for your feedback. I just posted another version of the patch which fixes indentation, and adds documentation and doctests to _iter_inner_.

Looking back at this, and considering your warning on the generators returned by pari, I think that the doctest for the iterator is probably too fragile. What do you think ?

E.
