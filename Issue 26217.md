The `ABmatrix` of a cusp of a number field is random as the docstring states, however, we are checking for the exact output in one place which is unfortunate as that output changes on some setups, e.g., within conda.

We should instead verify that the `ABmatrix` is correct.

Nitpick, but we usually just use `# random` instead of `# random output`. LGTM otherwise and you can set a positive review on my behalf once tweaked.
