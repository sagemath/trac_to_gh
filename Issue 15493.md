This is a followup to #15161, fixing some problems which arose from the changes there. In particular, if CHomP was installed, then the changes at #15161 led to some doctest failures.

LGTM. Just to note, I'm getting two errors, which weren't there before I installed the CHomP spkg, but the first is noted in #12607:

```
