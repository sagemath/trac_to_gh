# Issue 17575: Remove unused 'html-no-pix' docbuild format

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17812

Original creator: tmonteil

Original creation time: 2015-02-19 20:51:24

In #17498 a `html-no-pix` docbuild _format_ was introduced and then replaced with a `--no-plot` _option_ (in a further commit in the same ticket), but the `html-no-pix` format was not completely removed.

The aim of this micro-ticket is to fix this.

Looks good to me. According to `grep`, this is the only instance left of 'html-no-pix' in Sage.
