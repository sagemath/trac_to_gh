Keywords: semidefinite programming, user interface

the example 


```
sage: p = SemidefiniteProgram()
sage: x = p.new_variable(name="hihi")
sage: a1 = matrix([[1,2],[2,3]])
sage: a2 = matrix([[2,3],[3,4]])
sage: a3 = matrix([[3,4],[4,5]])
sage: p.set_objective(x[0] - x[1])
sage: p.add_constraint(a1*x[0]+a2*x[1]<= a3)
sage: p.show()
```


leaves the ``sage:`` prompt in the same line:


```
...
Variables:

   hihi[0],  hihi[1] sage:
```


removing the keyword `end=" "` [from the last call to](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/b630b412e00a23b319f9013d8c239b75248b7870/src/sage/numerical/sdp.pyx#L676) ``print``, makes the ``sage:`` prompt to display properly.
