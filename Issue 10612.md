This is probably explained by Cremona's comment at #10108:

"I think I can explain this. The problem to be solved for this ticket was that if mwrank is given incomplete but otherwise correct input, it just waits for the rest of the input, making Sage appear to hang.

Clearly what I did was insufficient, but this does explain who the order of executing commands does matter."

And there are patches at #10108 which represent a lot of work which have been lying about unused and unmerged just because they are not perfect, even if Sage is better with them than without.

The cause is that each time you call `mwrank_EllipticCurve.two_descent()`, it creates a new `__descent` (the 2-descent data) but does not reset the `__saturate` bound.  Therefore no saturation is done on the new `__descent` data, which is bad because `getbasis()` depends on the saturation having been done.  I'm now testing a patch.
