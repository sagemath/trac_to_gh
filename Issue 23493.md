# Issue 23493: InteractiveLPProblem fails to show the typeset dictionary

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23730

Keywords: typeset

`InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm::run_simplex_method()` does not show the typeset dictionaries.

```
sage: A = ([1,0],[0,1],[5,5],[6/10, 15/10])
sage: b = (50,35,300,63)
sage: c = (200,350)
sage: P = InteractiveLPProblem(A, b, c, variable_type=">=").standard_form()
sage: view(P.run_simplex_method())
```


When running`InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm::run_simplex_method()` in Juypter, it displays a mixture of LaTex code and the typeset dictionary. See attachments.

Note that the last dictionary in Jupyter is rendered. The problem seems to be with the color command.

As for the terminal, I am not sure what the desired output should be. The attached branch will work OK if one does `view(P.run_simplex_method(), tightpage=False)`, but produces no output at all otherwise. Compare it with results for `view([1,2])` with tight page and not.

The question is in how HTML should be rendered if sent to LaTeX. `P.run_simplex_method()` actually produces valid LaTeX code that can be just dropped normally between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`, but `view` makes use of some extra packages that make it not working.

Thanks a lot for the patch! It works perfectly for me.

Well, the main problem is that it does not work in Jupyter, but I have no idea in what place MathJax extensions are enabled for it and nobody replied to my question on sage-devel so far. All that has to be done is enabling `color.js` as it is done for SageNB and [SageMathCell](SageMathCell).
