Thanks for reporting this. I think this is ok. The problem here is not that the polynomial is not integral but that the polynomial is not in the domain.

This works:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
ValueError: reduction not defined for non-integral elements and x + 1/2 is not integral over Gauss valuation induced by 2-adic valuation
```


This does not:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.reduce(x + 1/2)
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field to Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
```

You are in the wrong domain in this example I think:
This is the error you are seeing because there is no element of valuation -2 in `ZZ[x]`.

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, ZZ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
ValueError: s must be in the value semigroup of this valuation but -2 is not in Additive Abelian Semigroup generated by 1
```


However, this works in `QQ[x]`.

```
sage: sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: v = valuations.GaussValuation(R, QQ.valuation(2))
sage: v.element_with_valuation(-2)
1/4
```


Does that make sense? (Should it be documented more explicitly?)
