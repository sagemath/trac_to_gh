There are some alternating sign matrices in `__classcall_private__` which do not belong!

That's a great start!

* parallel to `DyckWords`, it may make sense to introduce constants `up_step_symbol`, `level_step_symbol`, `down_step_symbol`.

* `return len([x for x in self._word if x == -1])` could be replaced with `self._word.count(down_step_symbol)`, etc.

* `MotzkinWord` should accept a `DyckWord` as input, replacing `dyck_word.close_symbol`s with `down_step_symbol`.

* the implementations of `height` and `heights` in `dyck_word.py` look simpler and faster.

* rename `ends_at_horizontal_axis` to `is_complete`.

* several other methods from `dyck_word.py`make sense for Motzkin paths.  Maybe you can simply copy-paste: `number_of_initial_rises`, `associated_parenthesis`, `peaks`, `valleys`,...

I don't think anyone is currently. In addition to Martin's comments, I would also make `MotzkinWord` a subclass of `ClonableArray` (maybe even `ClonableIntArray`). Other than that, I think it mostly needs a few more doctests.
