In the future, be sure to pick a component (for instance, calculus or symbolics); that will help people find it more easily.  Thanks for the bug report; mathematically incorrect is definitely bad!

I can confirm this.  Moving to major.  

Note the following.

```
sage: abs(pi+i)
pi + I
sage: abs(1+i)
sqrt(2)
sage: abs(n(pi)+i)
3.29690830947562
```

Pynac is somehow missing this.  Note that it gets e right.

```
sage: abs(e+i)
abs(e + I)
```

I can confirm this further.  It's mathematically seriously incorrect... so now moving from major to critical, and cc'ing burcin.

Note: 

```
sage: z = pi + i
sage: abs(z)
pi + I
sage: sqrt((z*z.conjugate()).expand())
sqrt(pi^2 + 1)
