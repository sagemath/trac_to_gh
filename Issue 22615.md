# Issue 22615: Define functions before calling them

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Code like

```
cdef class X:
    meth = staticmethod(func)

def func(...):
    ...
```

is currently accepted by Cython but actually invalid since `func` should be defined _before_ the line `meth = staticmethod(func)`.

When compiling with `binding=True`, code like the above breaks.
