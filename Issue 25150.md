Motivated by [this comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24551#comment:8), this removes some needless explicit `__eq__` and `__ne__` implementations from some classes in `sage.algebras` that subclass (directly or indirectly) `UniqueRepresentation`.

This also fixes problems with these classes on Python w.r.t. #24551.  There are likely other cases like this but I'm just looking one top-level sub-package at a time...
