Sorry about that, I took the first empty box as the comment box...

A few small comments:

- according to http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html I would do the following changes to Input and output:

```diff
-        Return the p-primary part of self.
+        Return the p-primary part of ``self``.

         INPUT:
 
-        -  ``p`` - a prime integer.
+        - ``p`` -- a prime integer

-        OUTPUT:
-
-        - Largest power of ``p`` dividing self
+        OUTPUT: largest power of ``p`` dividing ``self``
```

- also at the beginning of the method I would add `p = smallInteger(p)`, making the method capable of handling inputs as `2L`
- you can call right away `self._valuation(p)`, no need for this extra method in between (this does require adding the line as mentioned above)

There is still the double space before the "p".

Note, that I suggested also to change the output not to be a list (but if you like it better this way, I won't stop you).
