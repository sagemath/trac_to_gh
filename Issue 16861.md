Keywords: free modules, sum of terms, coercion,

On the one hand, yes, coercion is slow, so it is helpful to not use it by default. On the other hand:

```
sage: Sym = SymmetricFunctions(Zmod(2)); Sym.inject_shorthands()
sage: m.sum_of_terms([(Partition([2]), 2)])
2*m[2]
sage: _ == 0
False
sage: e(__)
0
```

I don't know if this causes actual issues anywhere else in the code, but I cannot rule it out...

That 2 in the example above is an integer 2 and not an integer 2 mod 2.  I have found it useful that free_module allows coefficients outside of the ring in the construction of elements.  The example that I have been considering is `f.map_coefficients(factor)` but this example raises its own problems.
