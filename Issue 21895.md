Keywords: base_ring

When defining point configurations with other base ring than QQ, the self reprensentation of the instance of the class PointConfiguration still returns QQ.

```
sage: AA(sqrt(2))
1.414213562373095?
sage: PointConfiguration([[AA(sqrt(2))]])
A point configuration in QQ^1 consisting of 1 point. The triangulations of this point configuration are assumed to be connected, not necessarily fine, not necessarily regular.
sage: PointConfiguration([[AA(sqrt(2))]]).base_ring()
Algebraic Real Field
```


The hardcoded "QQ" should be changed to be more flexible and actually return the type of base ring; e.g. AA, RDF, RLF or whatever. 

----

The code that needs to be changed reads:


```
        if self.is_affine():
            s += ' in QQ^'+str(self.ambient_dim())
        else:
            s += ' in P(QQ^'+str(self.ambient_dim()+1)+')'
        if len(self)==1:
            s += ' consisting of '+str(len(self))+' point. '
        else:
            s += ' consisting of '+str(len(self))+' points. '
```

I think there are some issues with that class. First of all, the fact that it's "UniqueRepresentation" is quite awful: it means that the construction parameters are cached globally, and hence pinned in memory until the structure disappears.

Furthermore, is this actually a parent?

```
sage: P=PointConfiguration([[1.17,2]])
sage: parent(P[0])
<type 'sage.geometry.triangulation.base.Point'>
```


and the derivation of the base ring seems fishy too:

```
sage: PointConfiguration([[1.0,2]]).base_ring()
Integer Ring
sage: PointConfiguration([[1.1,2]]).base_ring()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```

That seems wrong.

For the string representation, I'd go for

```
"Point configuration in affine %s-space over %s"%(P.ambient_dim(),P.base_ring())
```


The reality is, `QQ,AA,RDF` aren't actually print names of rings. They are just convenience bindings to commonly occurring rings.

This is actually a parent; the problem is that the `__getitem__` returns the points, not the elements:

```
sage: p = PointConfiguration([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[-1,-1]])
sage: p.an_element()
(<1,3,4>, <2,3,4>)
sage: parent(p.an_element()) is p
True
sage: list(p)
[P(0, 0), P(0, 1), P(1, 0), P(1, 1), P(-1, -1)]
```


Although I don't see the problem with this being a `UniqueRepresentation`. It isn't like the inputs are some strange/large objects that we want garbage collected. I was going to say there is enough computationally heavy things cached to further justify this, but what gets cached is not what I was expecting.

OK, I see. The documentation indeed says that elements of a pointconfiguration are triangulations (not points as the name suggests).

That can be a lot of points! And as you can see (because the parent needs to be normalized), the original input points would be a rather bad key to base the construction on. Also, because the input is so extensive, I would expect it to be very rare that someone would be trying to construct the same configuration twice without having access to exactly the same list of points.

Yes, the caching is fine, but I don't think we'd get much benefit from additionally keying that cache globally under the construction parameters rather than simply on the object itself and requiring that the user will keep a reference to the object for as long as he/she wants access to that cache.

Thank you guys for replying to the ticket! 

Ok, should the issue with `UniqueRepresentation` be moved to a new ticket?
And should we also open a ticket adressing the issue with the derivation of the base ring?

In this ticket simply wanted to make sure that is doesn't say "points in `QQ`", when the points are not rational.
