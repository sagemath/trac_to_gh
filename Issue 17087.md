# Issue 17087: homogenize for affine morphisms needs to use projective embedding

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently the following code fails because the domains don't match up.


```
P.<x,y,z> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
H=Hom(P,P)
f = H([x^2 - 2*x*y + z*x, z^2 -y^2 , 5*z*y])
f.dehomogenize(2).homogenize(2)==f
```


The fix is to use projective embedding and currently it also doesn't take into account the possibility of a different domain and codomain.

Played around trying to break it, didn't run into any problems, passed doc test on my end as well, setting to positive review
