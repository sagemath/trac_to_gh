Just wondered what reorganisation you'll be doing as I am currently working on #18712.
Would be good to make sure that any new code/documentation I write keeps in line with what you guys are up to.
Thanks

The idea is that toward the end of the (Northern Hemisphere) summer, it will be appropriate to improve things like `NormalFormGame?` and potentially reorganize/duplicate some documentation so that it's available as much as possible.  Anything you do would fit right in, I suspect.
