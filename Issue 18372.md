This material is under heavy development with a GSOC student, but before the end needs to be organized in such a way that both online documentation and the command line give useful information for as much as possible.

As an FYI, see #18127, which may (or may not) impact this slightly.

Just wondered what reorganisation you'll be doing as I am currently working on #18712.
Would be good to make sure that any new code/documentation I write keeps in line with what you guys are up to.
Thanks
James

The idea is that toward the end of the (Northern Hemisphere) summer, it will be appropriate to improve things like `NormalFormGame?` and potentially reorganize/duplicate some documentation so that it's available as much as possible.  Anything you do would fit right in, I suspect.
