# Issue 27614: Convert sqrt(D) to UCF

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27851

Original creator: vdelecroix

Original creation time: 2019-05-19 16:01:45

CC:  chapoton

For any `D`, `Q[sqrt(D)]` embedds into the universal cyclotomic field `UCF`. This ticket stands for the implementation of the conversion. It should cover the conversion of symbolic `sqrt(D)` as discussed in #27849.

See [this stackexchange post on how to do](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/282757/square-roots-of-integers-and-cyclotomic-fields)

Partial implementations that makes the conversion of `sqrt(-22/134)` works...

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
