Keywords: latex notebook typesetting

In the notebook with typesetting turned on, calling `latex(...)` should display the LaTeX as a string instead of typsetting the result.  This makes it easier to copy/paste the LaTeX which was explicitly asked for.  

I created this ticket on behalf of anonymous who [requested this feature for sage-mode](https://bitbucket.org/gvol/sage-mode/issue/24/sage-view-should-not-have-inline-view-when).  I'm pretty sure the fix for one will automatically apply to the other.  Also, it's a Sage change.

This is subtle.

`latex()` returns a `LatexExpr` object and that automatically gets typeset by `pretty_print`. If you want to turn it off then you will have to either
1. make `latex` return just a string, which will potentially break a lot of things (because some of us do want typeset stuff when typeset is on), or
2. you will have to modify `pretty_print`, or the toggle `pretty_print_default`,
3. or, add an extra keyword to `latex(..., pretty_print=False)` that defaults to false and that you can set to True in your sage mode (I am just guessing that perhaps you can do this automatically in sage mode - I don't use sage mode).

I'm definitely not in favor of 1.  I was thinking of 2, but 3 might be preferable.

FWIW, I'm not entirely convinced this is a useful feature, and I'm hoping that the original reporter will weigh in at some point.

Calling `latex()` *is* how typeset works in the notebook. You will have to come with an entirely new way of enabling typeset in the notebook if you want to disable this feature.

That is probably the root cause of this issue.  So right now we have:

```
a = 2/3
latex(a)
# displays \frac{2}{3}

show(a) 
# shows a nice fraction

show(latex(a))
# shows a nice fraction... because

latex(a) == latex(latex(a))
```


To my mind this behavior is questionable.  When I wrote the latex function, I meant for it to have a docstring like this (evidently, I never wrote a docstring, or at least the docstring for latex promises nothing meaningful):   "latex(x) returns a chunk of latex, which when typeset in math mode provides a visual representation of the object x."    With this interpretation, if the object x is a `LatexExpr` such as `\frac{2}{3`}, then a visual representation of that `LatexExpr` would be `\verb|\frac{2}{3}|`.

What do you think?

The problem is that you need a way to typeset LaTeX code as-is. Before #12156, there was no way to typeset hand-crafted LaTeX code in the notebook.

I agree that using

```
print latex(foo)
```

is a good solution, so there is no issue as far as I'm concerned.
