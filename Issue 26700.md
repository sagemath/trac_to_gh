This is bad because it compares using `<` and `>` even if the user only wanted to know if two things were equal:

```
                    if key_cs < key_co:
                        return rich_to_bool(op, -1)
                    elif key_cs > key_co:
                        return rich_to_bool(op, 1)
```

Instead, `richcmp_item` should probably be used here.

The error in `geometry/cone.py` seems unrelated. So LGTM.
