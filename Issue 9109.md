Hi Nicolas ! Thanks a lot for the numerous English corrections. The doc is
much better now ! I'm perfectly ok with all your changes, except for the
following wrong ReST markup:

I folded your patch and added this small change. It is a rather trivial change
but, in order to follow the rules, someone has to look at it. So it's now your
job to set the positive review :-)
