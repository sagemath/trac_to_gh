(part of meta-ticket #32414)

in `sage.structure.element`, we add a class `Expression`
- the existing class `sage.symbolic.expression.Expression` will be renamed to `Expression_pynac` and be its only subclass
- deprecate `is_Expression`, `is_SymbolicEquation`, `is_CallableSymbolicExpression`, `is_SymbolicVariable`; replace uses by `isinstance(x, Expression)` and a method call (may need a new method `is_callable`)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32638
