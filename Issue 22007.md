# Issue 22007: update gap_reset_workspace() and gap_packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22244

We ship some obsolete GAP packages, and should ship many more (with very small extra effort).

In view of this, also `gap_reset_workspace()` will need an update.

Also, one needs to review the call to `gap_reset_workspace()` in `spkg-install` of `database_gap`.

`QuaGroup` and `hecke` are two I would like to see added.

another request is to replace obsolete `braid` by [mapclass](https://gap-system.org/Packages/mapclass.html) - it provides the same functionality, and more.

#22190 is for replacing `braid` by `mapclass`.

I guess this can be closed as duplicate of #13426.

Closing tickets in the sage-duplicate/invalid/wontfix module with positive_review (i.e. someone has confirmed they should be closed).
