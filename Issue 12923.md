# Issue 12923: Update Cremona's table of elliptic curves to 240000

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13095

Original creator: cremona

Original creation time: 2012-06-08 09:08:13

Assignee: was

CC:  ohanar

Keywords: elliptic curve database

On 2012-06-06 John Cremona published an update of his database covering the conductor range 230000-240000.  The optional spkg database_cremona_ellcurve needs updating accordgingly.

I will link to a new spkg and add a small patch shortly.

Andrew, I hope you can review this as it's the first time I did this myself -- and it was so incredibly easy (thanks!).

Just made a couple of small fixes in the doctests, otherwise everything looks good.
