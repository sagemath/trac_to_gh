# Issue 16243: Upgrade readline to version 6.3

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16480

Original creator: emassop

Original creation time: 2014-06-15 16:05:17

CC:  vbraun stephen

This is needed to build on Arch. (Of course the build breaks again when Arch gets the next readline version and corresponding bash.)

The tarball is at [ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.3.tar.gz].

This requires new python because of [python issue 20374](http://bugs.python.org/issue20374).

Python in Sage has been updated to 2.7.8.

Is this patch ready for review?

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Wow, it has been two months since I built Sage (and ran into errors).

Yes, I think this is ready for review now.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to enhancement.

It works on archlinux. But somebody else has to test it on other supported platforms.

Builds and passes `sage -t --long --all` for me on Debian Squeeze-LTS x86_64. Can't review since I'm author on this ticket.

The most significant change is for OS/X, so it should definitely be tested there.

The file shobj-conf.patch does more than described in SPKG.txt. Those extra things should probably be removed from shobj-conf.patch or added in SPKG.txt. I do not, however, think that this is part of "upgrade to readline 6.3". Also I can't do this, as I don't have access to BSD or non-ELF systems.

This builds and seems to work well on OS X 10.9. Any suggestions for how to test it thoroughly?

I dug into the revision history to see what various chunks of shobj-conf.patch were for.

The FreeBSD related chunks seem to be remnants from FreeBSD's transition from a.out to ELF. Upstream has code for that now, so I discarded those chunks.

For OS/X, I traced the changes back to a patch on macports. There the patch has been updated and I have included the new version now. I think this is the sane thing to do for OS/X. Anyway, that patch has been included in macports for 4 months now, and there are no open bugs at https://trac.macports.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&component=ports&summary=~readline&order=priority so that should be fine.

I'm CC-ing Stephen because of the FreeBSD-related things. With readline 6.3 I think it should be possible to drop patch-build_pkgs_readline_fbsd-patch-src_support_shlib-install and patch-build_pkgs_readline_patches_shobj-conf.patch from the port at http://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/math/sage/ .

Okay, now I can crash Sage by typing some random text and then tapping the up-arrow a number of times. This is a known Readline 6.3 bug, reported [here](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2014-03/msg00010.html), and fixed [ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.3-patches/readline63-002 here]. I would like to get Readline at a higher patch-level, at least version 6.3.002.

Automatically generated tarballs are available from [http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/log/](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/log/). However I am unsure if the checksums are always the same. Moreover the top-level directory in those tarballs have a name that Sage doesn't like for renaming to src.

Should I upload a tarball with a renamed top-level directory somewhere? Or should I add (some of) the patches from ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.3-patches/ in git and apply them from spkg_install?

Its preferable to host the tarball somewhere under your control.

Generated tarball for Readline 6.3.008, using

```
$ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/readline.git
$ git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=readline-6.3.008/ -o readline-6.3.008.tar.gz HEAD
```

if you want to reproduce it. (HEAD should of course be at Readline-6.3 patch 8.) It's available at [http://www.ixsop.nl/sage/readline-6.3.008.tar.gz](http://www.ixsop.nl/sage/readline-6.3.008.tar.gz).

Are we waiting for a review on the FreeBSD related changes? I only have a machine running Arch, and so I can't help that.


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2014-09-28 21:27:46

Does it work with our Python? If yes somebody please update the description.


---

Comment by emassop created at 2014-09-28 21:54:38

Yes, it works with current Sage's Python. That comment in the description refers to #16260 which has been done a while now.
