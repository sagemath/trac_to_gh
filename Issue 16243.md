CC:  @vbraun stephen

This is needed to build on Arch. (Of course the build breaks again when Arch gets the next readline version and corresponding bash.)

The tarball is at [ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.3.tar.gz].

This requires new python because of [python issue 20374](http://bugs.python.org/issue20374).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16480

Builds and passes `sage -t --long --all` for me on Debian Squeeze-LTS x86_64. Can't review since I'm author on this ticket.

The most significant change is for OS/X, so it should definitely be tested there.

The file shobj-conf.patch does more than described in SPKG.txt. Those extra things should probably be removed from shobj-conf.patch or added in SPKG.txt. I do not, however, think that this is part of "upgrade to readline 6.3". Also I can't do this, as I don't have access to BSD or non-ELF systems.

I dug into the revision history to see what various chunks of shobj-conf.patch were for.

The FreeBSD related chunks seem to be remnants from FreeBSD's transition from a.out to ELF. Upstream has code for that now, so I discarded those chunks.

For OS/X, I traced the changes back to a patch on macports. There the patch has been updated and I have included the new version now. I think this is the sane thing to do for OS/X.
