Thanks for the review. (I should pick my Components more carefully ;)

You're welcome!  The change of "Component" was meant as an unserious reference to the moved file. 8-)

Replying to [comment:14 vbraun]:
> Doctests fail
Not on the system on which I tested it (just did another "make ptestlong" to double-check), GNU/Linux (Ubuntu) x86_64, Sage 6.3.beta0 with no other tickets merged.

All tests still pass after merging with 6.3.beta1 on GNU/Linux x86_64.  If this causes failing doctests on other systems, please give details.

Your doctests import `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.monsky_washnitzer` but it has been moved to `hyperelliptic_curves`. Try `sage -sync-build` or a complete rebuild to get rid of stale `.pyc` files.
