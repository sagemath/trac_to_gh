When you look at [this](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.html), there are a number of things wrong or confusing in the documentation.

Most importantly, several instances of Sha should have ticks, probably.  But are they referring to the mathematical object 

```
`Sha`
```

or the computer structure of the class

```
``Sha``
```

?  If I knew what was intended (given that the distinction is quite small), I would do this patch myself.  But it looks like sometimes the group is intended, other times the class object.

In line 198, 

```
 You can increase the `descent_second_limit` (in the above example
```

should have double ticks.

We also get the following warning:

```
sage-4.4.4/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/sha_tate.py:docstring of sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.sha_tate.Sha.bound_kato:12: (WARNING/2) Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
```

this probably refers to 

```
       THEOREM (Kato): Suppose `L(E,1) \neq 0` and `p \neq 2, 3` is a prime such that
            - `E` does not have additive reduction at `p`,
            - the mod-`p` representation is surjective.
       Then `{ord}_p(\#Sha(E))` divides `{ord}_p(L(E,1)\cdot\#E(\QQ)_{tor}^2/(\Omega_E \cdot \prod c_q))`.
```

but I'm not sure.

In line 756 we have 

```
We get no information the curve has rank 2.::
```

I don't understand this. My file sha_tate.py looks well different from the documentation link that you give. For instance I have changed the ``descent... thingy in trac 9287 merged as 14603 in 4.5.2.alpha1.

It should always be `Sha` never ``Sha``.

I believe this ticket solves the remaining problems. Though I have not checked it is needs to be rebased.

Yes, sorry I didn't see that - I've changed the description.  What is up with the "We get no information the " bit?  Maybe this is grammatically correct in the context of Tate-Shaf groups?  

Incidentally, though you changed the references to T-S, the file is S-T :)  Oh well; maybe that's as it should be if there isn't agreement.
