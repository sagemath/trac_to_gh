# Issue 30973: Make it possible to run github workflows manually

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31210

Sometimes it is convenient to run the Github workflows on a branch other than the main/develop one. Currently, one needs to open a PR on github for this. With the changes in this ticket, one can simply run the workflow directly from the sagetrac mirror on the desired branch.

Could you add a bit of documentation `src/doc/en/developer/portability_testing.rst`? Right now it recommends either using pull requests or pushing a tag.
