If one has flint-arb installed but not arb as a system package, then compilation currently fails unless one explicitly sets `ARB_LIBRARY = flint-arb`. In this ticket, we also check for the existence of flint-arb making this manual step obsolete. This is similar in spirit to #30706, which does the same for CBLAS.

The config file `build/pgks/arb/spkg-configure.m4` does a similar check (I think) and maybe can/needs to be adapted as well. If that's the case I would like to ask if somebody else can implement the necessary changes, as I've no experience with these config files. Thanks!

The code only provides a reasonable fall-back if `SAGE_ARB_LIBRARY` doesn't exist. Thus users on debian just have to set `SAGE_ARB_LIBRARY = "flint-arb"` and everything works as before.  
Do I miss something?

Want I want to support is installation of sagelib without the sage_conf package since I don't know how to install the latter with pipenv (I could install it by specifying the relative path in the pipfile, but that really ugly).

So in this ticket I provided a reasonable fallback, similar to what is done for singular and gap. How would this be implemented with sage.features?

The Sage distribution builds a wheel of it, you would just install from there.

That sounds reasonable. But it's also more work than I planned to invest into this, so I'll leave this to somebody else to implement.
