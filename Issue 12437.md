This ticket is about updating the developer guide for #10492.

The developer guide suggests (http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/producing_spkgs.html#the-file-spkg-txt)

```
      If your package depends on another package, say boehmgc, then you should check that this other package has been installed. Your spkg-install script should check that it exists, with code like the following:

      BOEHM_GC=`cd $SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard/; ./newest_version boehm_gc`
      if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Failed to find boehm_gc.  Please install the boehm_gc spkg"
          exit 1
      fi
```

This is totally wrong.  It only checks that a spkg _exists_, not that it has been installed.

This is almost good, but you should also provide a way to check that a package has been installed, regardless of its version number.  I was thinking along the lines of (not tested!)

```
if ! ls "$SAGE_ROOT"/spkg/installed/PACKAGE-* &>/dev/null; then
    echo >&2 "Package PACKAGE is required; please install it."
    exit 1
fi
```

Here's a new version which uses grep. The fricas example works in my testing.

I guess you're missing a negation there (you're failing if the package is found).

Don't use `grep -q`, it's not portable.  Instead use `grep >/dev/null`.  Finally, your regular expression is probably too complicated, I think

```
grep '^fricas-.*' >/dev/null
```

should suffice.  Your counterexample `fricasaldor-1.0.9` doesn't match it!

To be very safe, use `ls -1` instead of a plain `ls`.

Reviewer patch (apply on top of first patch) needs review.

I wouldn't mind a change like the following, but with or with this the reviewer patch gets a positive review.
