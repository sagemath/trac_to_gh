# Issue 12015: Bug in is_singular for plane projective curves

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: P.<X,Y,Z> = GF(2)[]
sage: C = Curve(X^2 + Y*Z)
sage: C.is_singular()
True
sage: C.is_smooth()
True
```

This happens exactly when the characteristic of the base field divides the degree and the curve is smooth.

Can you add a doctest to the patch, showing that the correct output is being produced in examples like the one above?

Apply only this patch -- whitespace changes by reviewer

Hi Charlie,

This looks good but there are a couple of niggling issues with formatting of the docstring: there is a rule that no tab characters should appear in Sage source files, and code blocks in docstrings need to have a double colon and a blank line before them. 

I've uploaded a new, corrected patch. Since I've only changed whitespace, I don't think we need another round of checking. All tests pass on selmer.warwick, so this gets a positive review.
