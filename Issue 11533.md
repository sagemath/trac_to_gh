We are getting 13 power755 locally but they'll go live at the end of September - I am currently installing a power720 that is meant to be a deployment server. Got a BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P as well but that would be another exercise :)

The big pity as far as I am concerned is that there is no Gentoo-prefix for linux-ppc otherwise I could have been up and running faster.

We currently have some power5 575 some of which are running suse 9 and that's awful, the latest gcc I have been able to compile is 4.2.4.

There are other errors in that last one but I think they are consequences of previous failures.

Same error in

```
again some other errors that are probably consequences of this particular failure. We get some qqbar.py errors too in that one.

come from sympow

So big trouble coming from mpfr or possibly mpir underneath. Once we isolate that most of these will disapear.

FWIW, I previously managed to reduce the doctest errors to 7 files IIRC; from sage-release (Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 thread):

P.S.: The following tests even timeout when run individually (with the
default timeout of half an hour on a quite fast box) in my current build:

sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx # Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx #
Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib
sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx # Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py #
Time out

Interestingly also sandpile takes a long time, although this is SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 (ppc64), Kernel version
2.6.32.43-0.4-ppc64 and not Ubuntu.

The other failing doctests are in:

  sage/misc/functional.py # 1 doctests failed
  (failing MPFR assertion)
  sage/interfaces/qepcad.py # 2 doctests failed
  (two funny errors)
  sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py # 2 doctests failed
  (two times "ValueError: negative dimensions are not allowed" in
list_plot3d())

Note that there are further doctest errors in the files which timeout,
i.e., before tests start to hang.


-leif
```

I unfortunately cannot tell (at least at the moment) how I exactly built that version since I had trouble with various things like GCC 4.4.6 not recognizing `-mvsx` (which ATLAS uses without first trying whether the command line option is supported) and the PolyBoRi spkg which didn't propagate `LIBRARY_PATH` etc.

Just one more detail on the crash running the test with -verbose to get the failing bit:

So we are expecting to catch some failure here in the first place and it doesn't go according to plan.

Also I forgot to mention I used the compiler fron SLES rather than compiling a newer version:

I am doing a complete test run with the new mpfi/mpfr combo but so far the results don't look any different. I looked a little bit more into the test that timed out (devel/sage/sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx) with verbose and it stops dead there:

```

```
I'll look at the other killed test (libecm.pyx) a bit later.

I did build both release candidates on Silius (Skynet); all [run] tests passed (although I don't recall with which GCC version; I guess I used my own build of 4.4.6).

I now see at least rc2 passed all tests with 4.3.4 and 4.6.1, too.

IIRC there was no difference to the rc2 (except for version strings and the like), but I can probably retry a build tomorrow.

If you have a skynet account, you can log into silius from eno; otherwise you can ask Mariah Lenox for an account.

I.e., Mariah did build GCC 4.6.2 with MPFR 3.1.0 as well.

(And I'm pretty sure it defaults to `power7`; as you can see the "native" [SuSE] GCC 4.3.4 defaults to `power4`.)

Please could you try with MPIR 2.1.3, which is as far as I know the version currently used by
Sage?

Well, that's the version *GCC* was built with, which doesn't matter here.

But I could rebuild and test MPFR 3.1.0 with (e.g.) MPIR 2.1.4 later.

Ok, I now also built MPIR 2.1.4 (changes w.r.t. 2.1.3 don't matter) and MPFR 3.1.0 with that version on silius; once without specifying any `CFLAGS` (such that MPIR used `-m64 -O3`, without any `-march=`/`-mcpu=`/`-mtune=`), once with `CFLAGS="-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -m64 -g -O3` (but in both cases only with *GCC 4.6.2*).

All test suites passed, as expected.

if I modify the function `mpfi_interv_z` of MPFI as follows:

```

int mpfi_interv_z(mpfi_ptr a,mpz_srcptr b,mpz_srcptr c)
{
  int inexact_left, inexact_right, inexact=0;

  mpz_dump (b);
  mpz_dump (c);
  if ( mpz_cmp(b,c) <= 0 ) {
    inexact_left = mpfr_set_z(&(a->left), b, MPFI_RNDD);
    mpfr_dump (&(a->left));
    inexact_right = mpfr_set_z(&(a->right), c, MPFI_RNDU);
    mpfr_dump (&(a->right));
  }
...
```
then I get:

```
sage: RIF(1,2)
000000000000000001
000000000000000002
0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000E65
0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001E65
get_str.c:149: MPFR assertion failed: size_s1 >= m
...
```
thus clearly something is corrupted with GMP and MPFR, since we should get:

```
1
2
0.10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000E1
0.10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000E2
```

Note: I cannot reproduce the problem outside from Sage, thus it is probably due to the way GMP (i.e., MPIR) and/or MPFR are compiled within Sage.

Francois, just to be sure, did you check MPFR is built with `--disable-thread-safe`?
Can you try to build GMP/MPIR and MPFR with `--enable-assert`?
If you tell me where your build is I can try again to isolate the problem.

FWIW, I've also built Sage 5.0.beta8 on silius (skynet), where GCC 4.6.3 meanwhile is the default compiler (although one still has to source `/local/bin/skynet_bash_profile`, since otherwise a few packages, two IIRC, fail to build because of wrong libraries / not sufficiently set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).

I've built once with MPIR 2.1.3 and once with MPIR 2.4.0[.p1], which doesn't seem to make a difference regarding the results of `ptestlong`.

According to Bill, MPIR doesn't make (much) use of assertions; they mainly rely on their test suites (same for FLINT).

I've uploaded two `config.log`s of MPFR from silius:

* [MPFR 3.1.0.p0 configured with MPIR 2.1.3](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/tmp/silius/MPFR-3.1.0.p0-config.log-Sage-5.0beta9-MPIR-2.1.3.p9.txt) (p9, Sage 5.0.beta9)

They don't differ except for the name of a temporary file.

(GCC 4.6.3, which meanwhile is the default compiler on that machine; `CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS`: `-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -O3 -g -fno-strict-aliasing`)

Leif,

thank you. I did compare your config.log of MPFR 3.1.0.p0 configured with MPIR 2.4.0 with the
one for a vanilla MPFR-3.1.0 configured with GMP 5.0.4:

(1) it seems your config.log does not extract CC and CFLAGS from gmp.h

(2) mine uses gcc -std=gnu99 instead of gcc alone

(3) your config.log uses -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 instead of -m64

(4) the linker used is ld in your case and `/usr/local/binutils-2.21.1/ppc64-Linux-power7-suse-gcc-4.6.1/bin/ld` for a vanilla MPFR

I'd like to reproduce exactly your build with a vanilla MPFR but I cannot access some of
your files:

```

zimmerma@silius:~/mpfr-3.1.0> ls /home/leif/Sage/release/build/silius/sage-5.0.beta9-gcc-4.6.3/local/include

It does, but MPIR takes (also) the flags I specified and hence writes these to `gmp.h`:

```sh
leif@silius:~/.../sage-5.0.beta9-gcc-4.6.3> egrep "__(GMP|MPIR)_(CC|CFLAGS)" local/include/gmp.h 
#define __GMP_CC __MPIR_CC
#define __GMP_CFLAGS __MPIR_CFLAGS
#define __MPIR_CC "gcc -std=gnu99"
#define __MPIR_CFLAGS " -g -O3 -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -O3 -g -fno-strict-aliasing "
```
(This is the `gmp.h` created by MPIR 2.**4.0**.p1.  I know the one from MPIR 2.1.3 does look different: First of all, `__GMP_CC` and `__GMP_CFLAGS` are defined to strings as well, instead of referring to their respective MPIR macros, and -- which is a known bug -- `__GMP_CC` doesn't contain `-std=gnu99`, although `__MPIR_CC` does.)


> (2) mine uses gcc -std=gnu99 instead of gcc alone


This shouldn't matter; I could retry building MPIR and MPFR with `CC="gcc -std=gnu99"` though.


> (3) your config.log uses -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 instead of -m64

I've copied the headers and libs into `/tmp/leif/sage-5.0beta9/MPIR-{2.1.3,2.4.0}/local/{include,lib}/`, so you should be able to configure MPFR with `--with-gmp=/tmp/leif/sage-5.0beta9/MPIR-2.1.3/local/` etc.

[Sorry for the delay, had some network trouble.]

with MPFR configured with `--enable-assert` within sage-5.0.beta9, I can simplify the
problem to:

```
sage: RIF(1,1)
get_exp.c:29: MPFR assertion failed: ((x)->_mpfr_d)[(((((x))->_mpfr_prec)-1)/(64 - 0)+1)-1] & ((~(mp_limb_t)0) ^ ((~(mp_limb_t)0) >> 1))

This means that we compute the exponent of a number which is either NaN, infinite or zero.
I will continue to investigate.

I have spent several hours on this and my conclusion is that the culprit is Sage (i.e. Cython).
In `real_mpfi.pyx` one can read:

```
            elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(a, Rational) and PY_TYPE_CHECK(b, Rational):
                rat = a
                rat1 = b
                # todo: The <object> coerce is evidently to get around a weird bug in SageX (?)
                mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1.value)
```
and the same coerce is done in the integer case.

I am 99% sure that we hit that weird bug. Indeed with `RIF(1,1)` the integers (mpz_t) which are
passed to `mpfi_interv_z` are malformed, with `SIZ=2` instead of `SIZ=1`.

However I have no idea how to solve that weird bug, or how to find another workaround.
Can we know who did write this comment?

It might be that the issue is related to the fact that the Power7 is big endian.
Was Sage tested on other 64-bit big endian platforms?

? The coercion is supposed to work around just that "weird bug", as I understand this.

But this comment is likely to be obsolete ("SageX") anyway; did you try removing the `<object>`?




> Can we know who did write this comment?


`hg annotate ...` (an alias for `blame` ;-) ) gives the changeset number, then `hg log [-v] ...` to see *who* made that change.

Well, [SunOS/Solaris] SPARC (V9), but the *64-bit* port (including x86_64) is still incomplete AFAIK.  (There's some wiki page on it, and a couple of meta-tickets; or ask Dave Kirkby, who did most if not all of it on his own.)

Leif,

```

------------------------------------------------------------

sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx:1045:47: Cannot convert 'mpz_t' to Python object
```
This is strange because `mpfi_interv_z` expects a `mpz_t` as 2nd and 3rd arguments, and
`integ.value` is a `mpz_t`, thus I don't see any reason to convert to a Python object.

I believe I understand what happens. The fact that `__pyx_t_3` has the wrong type is not a problem,
since it is a pointer, like what `mpz_t` expects as 2nd (and 3rd) argument of `mpfi_interv_z`.

However my guess is that the `__Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_3)` call is intended to increase a reference counter stored somewhere in the `PyObject` struct. Since `__pyx_v_integ->value` is not a Python object but a `mpz_t`, this call makes a side effect on the `mpz_t` structure, which has the

What is annoying is that this corruption **also happens** on other configurations (in particular

the `sandpile.py` doctest passes with `-long`, thus only 5 doctests fail.

the libecm problem disappears when configuring GMP-ECM with `--disable-asm-redc`. The error is when
the assembly function `mulredc1` is called. Nothing seems wrong in the arguments, and I cannot reproduce the problem when configuring GMP-ECM alone. Also after adding `make check` in spkg-install
everything is ok (btw why is `make check` not done?).

Maybe the problem is similar to the one Jeroen solved with MPFI?

Jeroen, I get the same backtrace, then the mulredc() function should call the assembly code
`mulredc1.asm` in the powerpc64 subdirectory. I don't know if this assembly function is
called or not. Could it be a problem in the way parameters are passed to that assembly function?

The pyx just contains a type definition, and passes a null pointer to `ecm_factor()` instead of some structure.  Segfaults also happen outside of Sage; see below.




> Is it possible to link libecm dynamically to Sage?


Of course, you just have to build a shared library (`ECM_EXTRA_OPTS="--enable-shared"`); see below.





This is IMHO an upstream (or probably compiler/assembler etc.) bug.

Note that GMP-ECM's test suite segfaults in its first test when configured with `--enable-shared` (and asm-redc enabled, which is the default).  Same for a trivial stand-alone program just resembling Sage's doctest.

The segfaults vanish in both cases if I in addition pass `--disable-asm-redc`.  So Sage just exposes the problem, it doesn't cause it.

[FWIW, Sage's `ecmfactor()` apparently works for even numbers, as well as interestingly 1025, while all other odd numbers between 950 and 1050 cause a segfault.]

Attachment [GMP-ECM_PPC64_ELF_function_descriptors.patch](tarball://root/attachments/some-uuid/ticket11705/GMP-ECM_PPC64_ELF_function_descriptors.patch) by @nexttime created at 2012-04-25 04:57:49

Replying to [comment:104 zimmerma]:
> Leif, if you make a patch for mulredc1.asm, maybe I could figure out what is needed in the m4
> generating file.


I've attached [a patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/11705/GMP-ECM_PPC64_ELF_function_descriptors.patch) to the three `.asm` / `.m4` files all PPC64 assembly files are generated from.  (FWIW, also applies clean to GMP-ECM 6.4.2.)

While the original files seem partially over-autoconf'd to me (e.g. `TEXT`, defined in `config.m4` after `configure`), I've currently "hardcoded" the ELF function descriptors, i.e., haven't used new macros for them at all.  Even if GMP-ECM currently only supports systems *using ELF* on PPC64 (I think; Darwin PPC is 32-bit, and `asm-redc` is disabled on it, although it IMHO wouldn't have to be), one could at least write some `m4` macros for [PowerPC] ELF![64] for convenience and put them into (e.g.) `powerpc64/elf.m4`, then probably only "enable" them if `configure` determines it's an ELF system.  (I didn't want to mess with the `autoconf` files anyway.)

One could also add some debugging info to the functions, i.e. traceback tables.

I haven't changed the broken indentation of `redc.asm`, to keep the patch small and readable.




A preliminary GMP-ECM 6.3.p8 spkg (applying my patches) is [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p8.spkg).  Note that it is based on the p7 from #12830, which still needs review.

### Patches
* ...
* mulredc.m4.patch, mulredc_1_2.m4.patch:
  Add function descriptors to PPC64 assembler code to support dynamic linking.
  (Even with a static `libecm.a`, Sage segfaulted with `--enable-asm-redc` on
  Linux PPC64, because the [static] GMP-ECM library gets linked into a shared
  library, namely the Python extension module "libecm".)
  We patch the two `m4` files the twenty `.asm` files (in `src/powerpc64/`)
  are generated from; the latter are again macroprocessor files from which the
  (only temporary) real assembly files ( `.s`) are created during build.
* redc.asm.patch:
  Also add a function descriptor here, although apparently this code isn't
  used by Sage, nor GMP-ECM's test suite, at least not currently (as of
  GMP-ECM 6.3 / ecm-6.3.p8).  (The function it provides is `ecm_redc3()`.)


### ecm-6.3.p8 (Leif Leonhardy, April 24th 2012)
* #12830: Add patches to `src/powerpc64/{mulredc,mulredc_1_2}.m4` to support
  dynamic linking, otherwise the Python extension module "libecm" segfaults
  with `--enable-asm-redc` on [Linux] PPC64, regardless of whether we build a
  shared and/or static GMP-ECM library.
  For consistency, also patch `src/powerpc64/redc.asm` in the same way, al-
  though it doesn't seem that this code was currently used.
  (See also the Linux PPC64 meta-ticket #11705.)


I've only tested it on Silius, with `--enable-shared` and `--disable-shared` (`--enable-asm-redc` is the default), with Sage 5.0.beta9 (plus some replacement spkgs and #12829) and GCC 4.6.3, FWIW.

Perhaps François could test the attached patch with vanilla GMP-ECM on AIX.

[Planned.]




> Perhaps François could test the attached patch with vanilla GMP-ECM on AIX.


Reading `configure.in` (of GMP-ECM 6.4.2), I see that `asm-redc` for PPC64 is currently only supported *on Linux* anyway, so testing it on AIX doesn't make sense.  (On AIX, it isn't enabled by default, and explicitly enabling it will just raise a `configure` error, so that's fine [for now].)

I did a test build and run of 5.1beta5 yesterday, with gcc-4.6.3 shipped with sage. There doctests failures in 4 files at this stage:

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/numerical/optimize.py # 6 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/libs/libecm.pyx # 7 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py # 4 doctests failed
```
Which I guess is fairly good and down from before the 5.0 release. I guess I should test an updated GMP-ECM next.

Hi Paul,

Haven't tried yet and I certainly can provide detailed output and backtraces. I have just started a 5.7beta4 with SAGE_DEBUG. On beta3 we have this kind of failures currently:

I've tried to build Sage on another Power 7 running debian.
This is a vanilla Sage 5.7 + ATLAS from #10508, I did not try to include any patch from here yet.
No problem to build it.
The log of "make ptestlong" is at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/ptestlong-gcc110-power7-debian.log
Ive not had a deep look but the failures look similar to what has been reported here.

You have more failures. In the tutorial translations curiously your gap install totally crashed. And the rings/arith.py failure is totally weird.

Did someone try to build pillow (included in latest betas)?
It seems to fail on gcc110 with ld yielding "escamotage incompatible" which is very nice french but not that easy to decipher without context.
Anyway it seems there is some 32/64 bit issue here, and the corresponding english error message would be "skipping incompatible library" which is more talkative.
