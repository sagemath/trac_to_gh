I am actually in the process of commissioning such hardware and suse will be on some nodes (Aix 6.1 on the other nodes).

fbissey -- do you want an account on skynet, so you can help us with porting to SUSE on a nice new "IBM Power 750 Express server" that we have?

This is the computer we have access to:  http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/hardware/750/index.html

We are getting 13 power755 locally but they'll go live at the end of September - I am currently installing a power720 that is meant to be a deployment server. Got a BlueGene/L and BlueGene/P as well but that would be another exercise :)

The big pity as far as I am concerned is that there is no Gentoo-prefix for linux-ppc otherwise I could have been up and running faster.

We currently have some power5 575 some of which are running suse 9 and that's awful, the latest gcc I have been able to compile is 4.2.4.

I notice in the build logs that you have gcc-4.6.1 on that box. Is it a manual install of gcc?

Yes.  Here is some info about the machine.  If you want an account on it, send me an email and I can arrange it.

I have created a spkg with the latest maxima in case that would make a difference but unsurprisingly it doesn't.

Benjamin posted a test log in #11708, let's analyse it:

Rather large numerical noise and some formatting noise which is more curious.

There are multiples instances of these errors in that test:

picklejar failure should be checked against the same error on arm. Possibly a deeper python problem.

come from sympow

So big trouble coming from mpfr or possibly mpir underneath. Once we isolate that most of these will disapear.

With the new mpir spkg from #11964, Sage builds for me on silius, using gcc 4.6.2.  I get a lot of test failures, though: I think that many of these are as reported before.  See [the log](http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/palmieri/misc/silius-ptestlong.log) for full details.

I was hoping the mpir upgrade would deal with some of these.
I'd like to try a vanilla compiler from SLES (gfortran is on a separate SDK DVD I discovered).

FWIW, I previously managed to reduce the doctest errors to 7 files IIRC; from sage-release (Sage 4.7.2.alpha3 thread):

P.S.: The following tests even timeout when run individually (with the
default timeout of half an hour on a quite fast box) in my current build:

sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx # Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx #
Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib
sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx # Time out
sage -t  -long -force_lib sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py #
Time out

Interestingly also sandpile takes a long time, although this is SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 (ppc64), Kernel version
2.6.32.43-0.4-ppc64 and not Ubuntu.

The other failing doctests are in:

  sage/misc/functional.py # 1 doctests failed
  (failing MPFR assertion)
  sage/interfaces/qepcad.py # 2 doctests failed
  (two funny errors)
  sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py # 2 doctests failed
  (two times "ValueError: negative dimensions are not allowed" in
list_plot3d())

Note that there are further doctest errors in the files which timeout,
i.e., before tests start to hang.


-leif
```


I unfortunately cannot tell (at least at the moment) how I exactly built that version since I had trouble with various things like GCC 4.4.6 not recognizing `-mvsx` (which ATLAS uses without first trying whether the command line option is supported) and the PolyBoRi spkg which didn't propagate `LIBRARY_PATH` etc.

I cannot really post many details right now but the errors are similar to before. Problems with mpfr and scipy are the main culprits.
Some details on the box used:

and the end of /proc/cpuinfo:

I can supply gdb output for the test that got killed, "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py":

I may try to upgrade mpfi/mpfr to see if it improve things.

Just one more detail on the crash running the test with -verbose to get the failing bit:

So we are expecting to catch some failure here in the first place and it doesn't go according to plan.

Also I forgot to mention I used the compiler fron SLES rather than compiling a newer version:

I am doing a complete test run with the new mpfi/mpfr combo but so far the results don't look any different. I looked a little bit more into the test that timed out (devel/sage/sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx) with verbose and it stops dead there:

```
Trying:
    RIF(Integer(5)).gamma()###line 4133:_sage_    >>> RIF(5).gamma()
Expecting:
    24
ok
Trying:
    a = RIF(Integer(3),Integer(4)).gamma(); a###line 4135:_sage_    >>> a = RIF(3,4).gamma(); a
Expecting:
    1.?e1
```

I'll look at the other killed test (libecm.pyx) a bit later.

ecm passed its test suite so it is quite strange.

Strangely enough I now get the following backtrace for real_mpfi.pyx, I have installed texlive in the mean time which may have made a difference.

did someone try to compile MPFR 3.1.0 outside from Sage, and run its test suite (make check)?
Same for MPFI 1.5.0?

note: I just tried MPFR 3.1.0 on top of MPIR 2.1.3 on gcc110.fsffrance.org and "make check"
worked.

Replying to [comment:27 zimmerma]:

I did build both release candidates on Silius (Skynet); all [run] tests passed (although I don't recall with which GCC version; I guess I used my own build of 4.4.6).

I now see at least rc2 passed all tests with 4.3.4 and 4.6.1, too.

Nope.

Leif,

please could you check again with the 3.1.0 release? Alternatively if I have access to this machine (Silius?) I can try to investigate. William, is it possible?

IIRC there was no difference to the rc2 (except for version strings and the like), but I can probably retry a build tomorrow.

If you have a skynet account, you can log into silius from eno; otherwise you can ask Mariah Lenox for an account.

Leif,

I only have an account on sage.math, thus I don't think I have one on eno.
Mariah, if you are out there, please can you create an account for me on skynet?
My email is Paul dot Zimmermann at inria dot fr.

I.e., Mariah did build GCC 4.6.2 with MPFR 3.1.0 as well.

(And I'm pretty sure it defaults to `power7`; as you can see the "native" [SuSE] GCC 4.3.4 defaults to `power4`.)

Please could you try with MPIR 2.1.3, which is as far as I know the version currently used by

Well, that's the version _GCC_ was built with, which doesn't matter here.

But I could rebuild and test MPFR 3.1.0 with (e.g.) MPIR 2.1.4 later.

Ok, I now also built MPIR 2.1.4 (changes w.r.t. 2.1.3 don't matter) and MPFR 3.1.0 with that version on silius; once without specifying any `CFLAGS` (such that MPIR used `-m64 -O3`, without any `-march=`/`-mcpu=`/`-mtune=`), once with `CFLAGS="-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -m64 -g -O3` (but in both cases only with _GCC 4.6.2_).

All test suites passed, as expected.

Not sure how I ended with a crash in real_mpfi.pyx, there is a time out. But I don't see a crash anymore after a rebuild from scratch including mpfi-1.5.0. The time out may be caused by some other components.

if I modify the function `mpfi_interv_z` of MPFI as follows:

```

int mpfi_interv_z(mpfi_ptr a,mpz_srcptr b,mpz_srcptr c)
{
  int inexact_left, inexact_right, inexact=0;

  mpz_dump (b);
  mpz_dump (c);
  if ( mpz_cmp(b,c) <= 0 ) {
    inexact_left = mpfr_set_z(&(a->left), b, MPFI_RNDD);
    mpfr_dump (&(a->left));
    inexact_right = mpfr_set_z(&(a->right), c, MPFI_RNDU);
    mpfr_dump (&(a->right));
  }
...
```

then I get:

```
sage: RIF(1,2)
000000000000000001
000000000000000002
0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000E65

```

thus clearly something is corrupted with GMP and MPFR, since we should get:

```

Note: I cannot reproduce the problem outside from Sage, thus it is probably due to the way GMP (i.e., MPIR) and/or MPFR are compiled within Sage.

Same thing with upper. But your remark about it working outside of sage makes me want to hack sage "provided atlas" style and see what happens.

Ok I did a build of 5.0.beta8-gcc along with the new mpir from #11616. I asked the gcc spkg to be built. I may do another build without it later. I didn't run all the test I just looked at one key test at the moment:sage -t -long  -force_lib "devel/sage/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py" because it is killed. I am still getting a backtrace similar to comment 21.

Francois, just to be sure, did you check MPFR is built with `--disable-thread-safe`?
Can you try to build GMP/MPIR and MPFR with `--enable-assert`?
If you tell me where your build is I can try again to isolate the problem.

Paul

Comment by leif created at 2012-03-22 07:15:38

FWIW, I've also built Sage 5.0.beta8 on silius (skynet), where GCC 4.6.3 meanwhile is the default compiler (although one still has to source `/local/bin/skynet_bash_profile`, since otherwise a few packages, two IIRC, fail to build because of wrong libraries / not sufficiently set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).

I've built once with MPIR 2.1.3 and once with MPIR 2.4.0[.p1], which doesn't seem to make a difference regarding the results of `ptestlong`.

----

According to Bill, MPIR doesn't make (much) use of assertions; they mainly rely on their test suites (same for FLINT).


---

Comment by leif created at 2012-03-22 07:35:44

P.S.: I've of course built MPIR 2.4.0 (successfully) with `SAGE_CHECK=yes`; the GCC on silius is itself built with MPIR 2.5.0 and MPFR 3.1.0.

I use `-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -O3 -g [-fno-strict-aliasing]`; with earlier Sage versions, I did build ECL with `-mcpu=power4 ...`, which (besides other variations) led to less errors (doctest errors in only 8 files IIRC), but I currently can't give a comparison or more details.

The MPFR 3.1.0.p0 spkg included in Sage 5.0.beta8 uses `--disable-thread-safe`.

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-03-22 22:29:40

All mpir/mpfr/mpfi tests pass (expect tget_set_d64 in mpfr which is skipped). One strange thing in mpfr

```
[tversion] MPIR: header 2.4.0, library 2.4.0
[tversion] MPFR tuning parameters from src/powerpc32/mparam.h
```

this is a powerpc64 machine (and I am sure mpir is configured 64bits), does it matter?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-03-23 01:25:44

It doesn't seem to matter but I am not sure the configuration works as it should in mpfr, if both __ARCH_PPC and __PPC64__ are present __PPC64__ is just ignored.


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-23 07:37:28

Francois,

I don't think it matters, since the `mparam.h` file only contains tuning parameters,
however I will fix that in the development version. Thank you for pointing out this.

Paul

in fact this issue was already fixed in the development version of MPFR. Here is a patch:

Replying to [comment:58 zimmerma]:
> would it be possible to send me the `config.log` file from MPFR when configured within Sage?

I've uploaded two `config.log`s of MPFR from silius:

 * [MPFR 3.1.0.p0 configured with MPIR 2.1.3](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/tmp/silius/MPFR-3.1.0.p0-config.log-Sage-5.0beta9-MPIR-2.1.3.p9.txt) (p9, Sage 5.0.beta9)

 * [MPFR 3.1.0.p0 configured with MPIR 2.4.0](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/tmp/silius/MPFR-3.1.0.p0-config.log-Sage-5.0beta9-MPIR-2.4.0.p1.txt) (p1 from #11616, otherwise Sage 5.0.beta9)

They don't differ except for the name of a temporary file.

(GCC 4.6.3, which meanwhile is the default compiler on that machine; `CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS`: `-mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -O3 -g -fno-strict-aliasing`)

Leif,

thank you. I did compare your config.log of MPFR 3.1.0.p0 configured with MPIR 2.4.0 with the
one for a vanilla MPFR-3.1.0 configured with GMP 5.0.4:

(1) it seems your config.log does not extract CC and CFLAGS from gmp.h

(2) mine uses gcc -std=gnu99 instead of gcc alone

(3) your config.log uses -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 instead of -m64

(4) the linker used is ld in your case and `/usr/local/binutils-2.21.1/ppc64-Linux-power7-suse-gcc-4.6.1/bin/ld` for a vanilla MPFR

I'd like to reproduce exactly your build with a vanilla MPFR but I cannot access some of
your files:

```

zimmerma@silius:~/mpfr-3.1.0> ls /home/leif/Sage/release/build/silius/sage-5.0.beta9-gcc-4.6.3/local/include
ls: cannot access /home/leif/Sage/release/build/silius/sage-5.0.beta9-gcc-4.6.3/local/include: Permission denied

It does, but MPIR takes (also) the flags I specified and hence writes these to `gmp.h`:


```sh
leif@silius:~/.../sage-5.0.beta9-gcc-4.6.3> egrep "__(GMP|MPIR)_(CC|CFLAGS)" local/include/gmp.h 
#define __GMP_CC __MPIR_CC
#define __GMP_CFLAGS __MPIR_CFLAGS
#define __MPIR_CC "gcc -std=gnu99"
#define __MPIR_CFLAGS " -g -O3 -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 -O3 -g -fno-strict-aliasing "
```

(This is the `gmp.h` created by MPIR 2.*4.0*.p1.  I know the one from MPIR 2.1.3 does look different: First of all, `__GMP_CC` and `__GMP_CFLAGS` are defined to strings as well, instead of referring to their respective MPIR macros, and -- which is a known bug -- `__GMP_CC` doesn't contain `-std=gnu99`, although `__MPIR_CC` does.)


> (2) mine uses gcc -std=gnu99 instead of gcc alone

This shouldn't matter; I could retry building MPIR and MPFR with `CC="gcc -std=gnu99"` though.


> (3) your config.log uses -mcpu=power7 -mtune=power7 instead of -m64

See above.

I've copied the headers and libs into `/tmp/leif/sage-5.0beta9/MPIR-{2.1.3,2.4.0}/local/{include,lib}/`, so you should be able to configure MPFR with `--with-gmp=/tmp/leif/sage-5.0beta9/MPIR-2.1.3/local/` etc.

[Sorry for the delay, had some network trouble.]

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-23 17:29:06

with MPFR configured with `--enable-assert` within sage-5.0.beta9, I can simplify the
problem to:

```
sage: RIF(1,1)
get_exp.c:29: MPFR assertion failed: ((x)->_mpfr_d)[(((((x))->_mpfr_prec)-1)/(64 - 0)+1)-1] & ((~(mp_limb_t)0) ^ ((~(mp_limb_t)0) >> 1))
```

This means that we compute the exponent of a number which is either NaN, infinite or zero.
I will continue to investigate.

Paul

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-23 22:15:07

I have spent several hours on this and my conclusion is that the culprit is Sage (i.e. Cython).
In `real_mpfi.pyx` one can read:

```
            elif PY_TYPE_CHECK(a, Rational) and PY_TYPE_CHECK(b, Rational):
                rat = a
                rat1 = b
                # todo: The <object> coerce is evidently to get around a weird bug in SageX (?)
                mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1.value)
```

and the same coerce is done in the integer case.

I am 99% sure that we hit that weird bug. Indeed with `RIF(1,1)` the integers (mpz_t) which are
passed to `mpfi_interv_z` are malformed, with `SIZ=2` instead of `SIZ=1`.

However I have no idea how to solve that weird bug, or how to find another workaround.
Can we know who did write this comment?

It might be that the issue is related to the fact that the Power7 is big endian.
Was Sage tested on other 64-bit big endian platforms?

Replying to [comment:63 zimmerma]:

? The coercion is supposed to work around just that "weird bug", as I understand this.

But this comment is likely to be obsolete ("SageX") anyway; did you try removing the `<object>`?




> Can we know who did write this comment?

`hg annotate ...` (an alias for `blame` ;-) ) gives the changeset number, then `hg log [-v] ...` to see _who_ made that change.

Well, [SunOS/Solaris] SPARC (V9), but the _64-bit_ port (including x86_64) is still incomplete AFAIK.  (There's some wiki page on it, and a couple of meta-tickets; or ask Dave Kirkby, who did most if not all of it on his own.)

Leif,

yes I tried removing the coercion. It gives:

```
Error compiling Cython file:

                mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1.value)

                integ = a
                integ1 = b
                mpfi_interv_z(self.value, integ.value, integ1.value)
                                              ^
------------------------------------------------------------

sage/rings/real_mpfi.pyx:1045:47: Cannot convert 'mpz_t' to Python object
```

This is strange because `mpfi_interv_z` expects a `mpz_t` as 2nd and 3rd arguments, and
`integ.value` is a `mpz_t`, thus I don't see any reason to convert to a Python object.

on sage.math with Sage 4.8 `hg annotate` gives:

```
 2617:                 # todo: The <object> coerce is evidently to get around a weird bug in SageX (?)  
 2617:                 mpfi_interv_q(self.value, <object>rat.value, <object>rat1

```

then:

```

I'll thus ask William to help.

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-24 07:33:37

I've sent a private mail to William. The bug seems clearly in Cython. In `real_mpfi.c` I see:

```
      __pyx_t_3 = ((PyObject *)__pyx_v_integ->value);
      __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_3);
      __pyx_t_8 = ((PyObject *)__pyx_v_integ1->value);
      __Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_8);
      mpfi_interv_z(((struct __pyx_obj_4sage_5rings_9real_mpfi_RealIntervalFiel\
dElement *)__pyx_v_self)->value, __pyx_t_3, __pyx_t_8);
```

thus `__pyx_t_3` is of the wrong type: it should be of type Integer and not of type Python object
(compare to the call to `mpfi_set_z` in the same file).

Paul


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-24 08:30:42

I believe I understand what happens. The fact that `__pyx_t_3` has the wrong type is not a problem,
since it is a pointer, like what `mpz_t` expects as 2nd (and 3rd) argument of `mpfi_interv_z`.

However my guess is that the `__Pyx_INCREF(__pyx_t_3)` call is intended to increase a reference counter stored somewhere in the `PyObject` struct. Since `__pyx_v_integ->value` is not a Python object but a `mpz_t`, this call makes a side effect on the `mpz_t` structure, which has the
effect to increase its "size" from 1 to 2, which explains why the `mpz_t` object seen by
`mpfi_interv_z` is corrupted.

What is annoying is that this corruption **also happens** on other configurations (in particular
little endian). For some reason it gets unnoticed, maybe because the corrupted field is not the size
(maybe the allocated size). However one might be able to reproduce the problem also by changing the
order of the fields in the `mpz_t` structure in `gmp.h`. Putting `_mp_size` first seems to
break Sage on 64-bit Intel processors.

I still got no answer from William. Does anybody know if it is possible to recompile Sage
after modifying manually the `real_mpfi.c` file, without it being automatically generated?
My idea is to remove the `__Pyx_INCREF` instructions to confirm my guess.

`./sage -b` should just do that, since Cython won't (re)generate files that are newer than their sources.

Of course first make a copy of it, but I've patched C and C++ files generated by Cython a couple of times without problems.


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-28 11:59:11

thank you Leif. This confirms my guess: if I comment the two `__Pyx_INCREF` before
the call to `mpfi_interv_z`, and the two `__Pyx_DECREF` after, then `RIF(1,1)`
runs ok.

The problem is thus isolated, we now need somebody fluent in Cython to solve it or find
another (platform independent) workaround.

Where do we report Cython bugs?

1. Because it is not needed.
2. Because in Sage, you should use `sage_free()` (which blocks interrupts and could potentially do other stuff too).

with the patch on top of sage-5.0.beta10, we are making good progress, but the following doctests still fail:

Paul


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-03-29 09:11:43

the libecm problem disappears when configuring GMP-ECM with `--disable-asm-redc`. The error is when
the assembly function `mulredc1` is called. Nothing seems wrong in the arguments, and I cannot reproduce the problem when configuring GMP-ECM alone. Also after adding `make check` in spkg-install
everything is ok (btw why is `make check` not done?).

Maybe the problem is similar to the one Jeroen solved with MPFI?

Jeroen, I get the same backtrace, then the mulredc() function should call the assembly code
`mulredc1.asm` in the powerpc64 subdirectory. I don't know if this assembly function is
called or not. Could it be a problem in the way parameters are passed to that assembly function?

I tried configuring GMP-ECM with `-enable-assert`, nothing wrong happens.
I have no further idea to investigate. Any suggestion out there?

Of course a possible workaround would be to configure with `--disable-asm-redc` on
powerpc64, but it would be nice to find the reason of this problem. Is there any other
powerpc on which we could test?

What is strange is that the bug occurs **inside** libecm.a when called from within Sage,
and does not occur when called from the binary GMP-ECM (with the same libecm.a). Maybe a memory corruption related to the ecm_params structure which is not really defined in libecm.pyx? Is it possible to link libecm dynamically to Sage?

Ok so I applied the patch to beta10 and run the long test (in serial) and we have made a lot of progress:

        sage -t -long "devel/sage/sage/functions/special.py"

I had a quick look at the other ppc64 issues, but I couldn't immediately find out what the problem was.

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-04-11 21:59:32

I think we should split the libecm.pyx issue as well. I think at least two other failures are linked to a single problem in scipy (optimize.py and list_plot3d.py) but I haven't been able to track that down yet, upgrading scipy to 0.10.1 doesn't solve the problem.

The pyx just contains a type definition, and passes a null pointer to `ecm_factor()` instead of some structure.  Segfaults also happen outside of Sage; see below.




> Is it possible to link libecm dynamically to Sage?

Of course, you just have to build a shared library (`ECM_EXTRA_OPTS="--enable-shared"`); see below.





This is IMHO an upstream (or probably compiler/assembler etc.) bug.

Note that GMP-ECM's test suite segfaults in its first test when configured with `--enable-shared` (and asm-redc enabled, which is the default).  Same for a trivial stand-alone program just resembling Sage's doctest.

The segfaults vanish in both cases if I in addition pass `--disable-asm-redc`.  So Sage just exposes the problem, it doesn't cause it.

[FWIW, Sage's `ecmfactor()` apparently works for even numbers, as well as interestingly 1025, while all other odd numbers between 950 and 1050 cause a segfault.]

I'll also take a closer look at the asm code; it's probably just incompatible to the ppc64 ABI when linked dynamically.  Even `mulredc1()`, which only uses registers (besides storing the result into the `mp_limb_t` whose address is passed), segfaults.  (Or probably the calling function segfaults immediately after return).

The assembly code cannot work with dynamic linking, as all of its functions lack function descriptors.

I'll try to fix that tomorrow, although presumably not [yet] by an upstream-ready patch, as the `.asm` (`m4`) files are itself generated by `m4`, but normally not at build time.  Unfortunately also the real assembler (`.s`) files, which are generated from the `.asm` files, aren't kept, so it's impossible to (temporarily) patch these.

Patch to GMP-ECM's PowerPC64 assembly[-generating] files to support dynamic linking (on ELF systems only).  For reference only.


---

Attachment

Replying to [comment:104 zimmerma]:
> Leif, if you make a patch for mulredc1.asm, maybe I could figure out what is needed in the m4
> generating file.

I've attached [a patch](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/raw-attachment/ticket/11705/GMP-ECM_PPC64_ELF_function_descriptors.patch) to the three `.asm` / `.m4` files all PPC64 assembly files are generated from.  (FWIW, also applies clean to GMP-ECM 6.4.2.)

While the original files seem partially over-autoconf'd to me (e.g. `TEXT`, defined in `config.m4` after `configure`), I've currently "hardcoded" the ELF function descriptors, i.e., haven't used new macros for them at all.  Even if GMP-ECM currently only supports systems _using ELF_ on PPC64 (I think; Darwin PPC is 32-bit, and `asm-redc` is disabled on it, although it IMHO wouldn't have to be), one could at least write some `m4` macros for [PowerPC] ELF![64] for convenience and put them into (e.g.) `powerpc64/elf.m4`, then probably only "enable" them if `configure` determines it's an ELF system.  (I didn't want to mess with the `autoconf` files anyway.)

One could also add some debugging info to the functions, i.e. traceback tables.

I haven't changed the broken indentation of `redc.asm`, to keep the patch small and readable.




A preliminary GMP-ECM 6.3.p8 spkg (applying my patches) is [here](http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/leif/Sage/spkgs/ecm-6.3.p8.spkg).  Note that it is based on the p7 from #12830, which still needs review.

### Patches
 * ...
 * mulredc.m4.patch, mulredc_1_2.m4.patch:
   Add function descriptors to PPC64 assembler code to support dynamic linking.
   (Even with a static `libecm.a`, Sage segfaulted with `--enable-asm-redc` on
   Linux PPC64, because the [static] GMP-ECM library gets linked into a shared
   library, namely the Python extension module "libecm".)
   We patch the two `m4` files the twenty `.asm` files (in `src/powerpc64/`)
   are generated from; the latter are again macroprocessor files from which the
   (only temporary) real assembly files ( `.s`) are created during build.
 * redc.asm.patch:
   Also add a function descriptor here, although apparently this code isn't
   used by Sage, nor GMP-ECM's test suite, at least not currently (as of
   GMP-ECM 6.3 / ecm-6.3.p8).  (The function it provides is `ecm_redc3()`.)


### ecm-6.3.p8 (Leif Leonhardy, April 24th 2012)
 * #12830: Add patches to `src/powerpc64/{mulredc,mulredc_1_2}.m4` to support
   dynamic linking, otherwise the Python extension module "libecm" segfaults
   with `--enable-asm-redc` on [Linux] PPC64, regardless of whether we build a
   shared and/or static GMP-ECM library.
   For consistency, also patch `src/powerpc64/redc.asm` in the same way, al-
   though it doesn't seem that this code was currently used.
   (See also the Linux PPC64 meta-ticket #11705.)


I've only tested it on Silius, with `--enable-shared` and `--disable-shared` (`--enable-asm-redc` is the default), with Sage 5.0.beta9 (plus some replacement spkgs and #12829) and GCC 4.6.3, FWIW.

Perhaps François could test the attached patch with vanilla GMP-ECM on AIX.


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2012-04-25 08:09:23

Leif, thank you very much for your patch. I have incorporated it to the development version,
where it applies cleanly. I have checked that both --enable-shared and --disable-shared work on silius.

Patching `configure`[`.in`] to also include `powerpc64/elf.m4` if appropriate is trivial, so I'll probably add that, too.  (And write [slightly corrected] `PROLOG()` / `EPILOG()` macros.)

[Planned.]




> Perhaps François could test the attached patch with vanilla GMP-ECM on AIX.

Reading `configure.in` (of GMP-ECM 6.4.2), I see that `asm-redc` for PPC64 is currently only supported _on Linux_ anyway, so testing it on AIX doesn't make sense.  (On AIX, it isn't enabled by default, and explicitly enabling it will just raise a `configure` error, so that's fine [for now].)

Which I guess is fairly good and down from before the 5.0 release. I guess I should test an updated GMP-ECM next.

Are you sure, because I still get the 5 failures mentioned in the ticket description on Skynet silius.

That's very curious. I didn't have it in my doctest run. I must have done it wrong. The cvxopt does indeed still fail.

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-06-25 09:33:51

Sage's cvxopt spkg sucks. It's way overlinked everywhere. It probably won't help much with the tests but I will do experiments to bring it 1.1.5 and clean that mess.

Looking at special.py tests

```
sage: elliptic_kc(0.5)
1.8540746773
sage: elliptic_f(RR(pi/2), 0.5)
elliptic_f(1.57079632679490, 0.500000000000000)
sage: elliptic_f(1.57079632679490, 0.500000000000000)
1.8540746773
```

So in effect elliptic_f is not evaluated straight away on power7.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2012-06-29 03:47:22

Just a note, it may not be power7 specific. I am building a debug version of sage with SAGE_DEBUG=yes and polybori-0.8.1.p0 compilation broke. So far that's the only thing that failed to build with SAGE_DEBUG.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-11 08:43:37

Well, that was a long time to do anything. I have just build 5.7.beta3 + numpy-1.7. Apart from the expected stuff from numpy we have the same doctest files failing. But the number has gone down for two of them:

```
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/libs/libecm.pyx # 7 doctests failed [was 10]
sage -t -long devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/optimize.py # 2 doctests failed [was 6]
```

Now that we have a killer debugging system in place things may get interesting.

I unfortunately no longer have access to a ppc64 system. Is anybody willing to donate access to such a machine for the Sage buildbot?

I cannot donate unfortunately - not without losing my job. What happened to silius?

It has been down for a while, that's all I know.

Francois, for libecm, did you apply the patch to allow dynamic linking with assembly files?

I could try to help with libecm.pyx if you provide a detailed output of the libecm failures.

I could possibly donate expertise to bring it back up depending on whether it can be dealt with remotely or not. But I would need more details on the way it is administered, I doubt there is an HMC or an xcat server for just one node.

Hi Paul,

Haven't tried yet and I certainly can provide detailed output and backtraces. I have just started a 5.7beta4 with SAGE_DEBUG. On beta3 we have this kind of failures currently:

I have an unexpected development at #14098 SAGE_DEBUG=yes seems to imply that tests are run on most spkg and zn_poly died an horrible death.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-11 20:30:56

AH reading spkg-install it doesn't imply testing of all spkg this one has a quick test suite that always run. And it didn't fail in beta3 without debug and now fails in beta4 with debug.

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-12 09:02:35

OK done. I am trying to figure out cvxopt problems again. I will split up the ecm issue since we have a fix. Is the fix included in newer ecm? sage is a bit behind it could be an opportunity to upgrade. I know that 6.4.2 compiles fine under linux and works with sage without changes - doesn't compile in my gentoo prefix on my imac core2 duo but I suspect the problem is the compiler.


---

Comment by zimmerma created at 2013-02-12 09:23:08

Francois, the ecm patch is not yet included in the last release 6.4.3. I'll see if we can make
a new release of GMP-ECM.

Paul

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-12 09:31:33

OK that's cool. In the mean time I'll do a new run o doctesting - I haven't done a full one on that build yet I had limited myself to key tests. And I have just found:

```
frb15@p2n14-c /hpc/scratch/frb15/sandbox/sage-5.7.beta4 :./sage -t  --long -force_lib devel/sage/sage/plot/plot3d/list_plot3d.py

         [16.4 s]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
Total time for all tests: 16.6 seconds
```

So somehow this one got fixed. I had misread the test results from beta3+numpy-1.7. So updating description again.

We have a method that completely fail to converge. I had done some exploration in #12832 when I thought it was a problem in scipy and I will probably continue to track that one over there after a good editing of the issue description.

Francois, please could you try the new release candidate of GMP-ECM at
http://www.loria.fr/~kruppaal/ecm-6.4.4-rc2.tar.gz? It includes the patch of this ticket.

I've tried to build Sage on another Power 7 running debian.
This is a vanilla Sage 5.7 + ATLAS from #10508, I did not try to include any patch from here yet.
No problem to build it.
The log of "make ptestlong" is at
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/jpflori/ptestlong-gcc110-power7-debian.log
Ive not had a deep look but the failures look similar to what has been reported here.

You have more failures. In the tutorial translations curiously your gap install totally crashed. And the rings/arith.py failure is totally weird. I'll try to move to 5.8.beta to see if I can reproduce some of these. You don't have the failure in functions/special.py. I suspect gcc is involved. What gcc do you use?

Please note I used 5.7 (plus new ATLAS).

Its

```
gcc version 4.7.2 20121109 (Red Hat 4.7.2-8) (GCC)
```

And as you can see its not Debian but Fedora...

OK, I think getting a new gcc on board may help. Of course you are using a gcc provided by red hat for ppc so there may be specific fixes in there. We know that some version of gcc were leading to breakage in ecl earlier on.

The next thing is that in some circumstances your GAP is breaking. If it was just plain broken there would be more test failures.

You mean more recent that 4.7.2?
That will be quite bleeding edge won't it?

Indeed, I can launch the built gap and compute 1+1

I retested arith.py individually and it just worked...

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-02-28 22:09:37

Same for all rst files except cvxopt.rst which still fails (prec problem which was already reported here on the Suse install).

optimize.py and libecm.py are still failing as expected.

special.py still does not fail.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-02-28 22:14:03

I was going to ask you to re-test. Not reproducible, it may be a small problem with parrallel testing, possibly concurrent GAP sessions. Not sure for arith.py.

As for compiler I meant that I used 4.7.1 for my own build. You are using a recent so you could also have small bug fix in kernel or glibc that helps (on a not mainstream platform).

I tried 5.8.beta2 with gcc 4.7.2 and it is worse (no patch applied):

```
The following tests failed:

        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/groups/matrix_gps/matrix_group.py # Time out
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/combinat/sf/k_dual.py # Time out
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/doc/en/numerical_sage/cvxopt.rst # 1 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/libs/libecm.pyx # 7 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/functions/special.py # 2 doctests failed
        sage -t -long  -force_lib devel/sage-main/sage/numerical/optimize.py # 2 doctests failed
```

So I still get the special.py failure which means something esle fixed it for you (I suspect glibc/kernel). I also have two time out. I am doing a gcc 4.7.1 to see if they are compiler dependent.

I redid the build with gcc-4.7.1 and I am back with the same failures as before. It could also be that red hat has put some ppc64 specific fix in their gcc. Which exact version of fedora do you have?

That's gcc110 from http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm
It's stated its 

```

gcc110      2TB    4x16x3.55 GHz IBM POWER7 / 64 GB RAM / IBM Power 730 Express server / Fedora 18 ppc64
```


From there I gathered

I really have to dig the patches from redhat. I have just done a build with gcc-4.8.0 vanilla and there is no changes.

I am planing to test the new e cm spkg ASAP but I am a bit buried into reporting at work. Upstream cvxopt provided me with a cvxopt 1.1.6beta to try to solve the issue. It is on my todo list as well. Finally from Jean-Pierre's test it look like the ecl/maxima problem is one last gcc issue on ppc. I heve to try patch from fedora to gcc to confirm this.

yes, the beta sent to m e by upstream seems to solve all the problems.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-05-15 08:11:01

I'm using the skynet machine `silius`, which is back online.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-05-15 09:36:20

Is silius still running SLES11? If so which SP? It seems that Jean-Pierre had more luck with that last bug using fedora 18. So I am suspecting something in the toolchain - but it could be ld, glibc or even kernel stuff rather than just gcc.


---

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2013-05-15 09:44:32

According to `/etc/issue`, it is `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1`.

I suppose you are refering to the `special.py` failure? Why do you think it is a GCC issue?

If there is another machine on which `special.py` works, then we can really investigate. jpflori: can you retest with the latest Sage beta? If everything works there, is there any chance I could get access to that machine?


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2013-05-24 10:29:12

Yes, this is the last failure we observe. It is related to maxima/ecl. I have no proof of it being caused by GCC. Just a hunch based on the fact that the first hurdle we had in the port was that maxima wouldn't build because the version of GCC used miscompiled ecl. Furthermore Jean-Pierre Flori reports that he doesn't observe the failure on fedora 18 whose toolchain is based on gcc-4.8.0.

My gut feeling is that an element of the toolchain is responsible.

I've just launched a build of 5.10.beta5 (not official, but at least there is the latest ATLAS there).
And yes I guess you can access it, it's gcc110 on GCC Compile Farm.

Did you try to build ECL with `-mcpu=power4` (as opposed to `power7`, say)?  (Maxima will pick up ECL's flags, too.)

Although both Maxima and ECL have meanwhile been upgraded at least once, I previously did have more luck with that.  (I'm not entirely sure, but IIRC GCC 4.4.6 did successfully build ECL and Maxima even without that, and with much fewer doctest failures, and especially ;-) not in `special.py`.  Same with later GCC versions _and_ `-mcpu=power4`.)

Note that distros' GCCs generally use more generic target CPU types than a GCC you build natively.

Ask for an account foolowing the instructions there:

saying you're working on (the GPL licensed) Sage.
The guy in charge is quite reactive.

5.12.beta1 on SLES11SP1 with gcc 4.8.1 and binutils 2.22. Still problems in functions/special.py - there is one more failure there. I also got two timeout but I haven't checked yet increasing the time limit.

Did someone try to build pillow (included in latest betas)?
It seems to fail on gcc110 with ld yielding "escamotage incompatible" which is very nice french but not that easy to decipher without context.
Anyway it seems there is some 32/64 bit issue here, and the corresponding english error message would be "skipping incompatible library" which is more talkative.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2014-01-21 10:04:41

Usually because you try to link a 64 bit object with a 32bit library. Yes it probably find the wrong version of one of the libraries (ziplib, png, jpeg) the setup script is not very smart but I thought we had ourselves covered. Would you by any chance have some of the aforementioned libraries installed in 32bit but not 64?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-01-21 10:08:13

I'll have a look.
Sorry for the rough report, I basically just wanted to know if that also happened to someone else, so I did not investigate it yet.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2014-01-21 10:12:34

I have 6.1 beta3 built here with pillow and without a hitch. I honestly don't think it is a power7 issue per see. setup.py is not very smart at detecting stuff so you have to consider all corners. I have been in the latest gentoo bug concerning building pillow as well as the pillow ticket here. This stuff is fragile.


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2014-01-21 15:00:28

Ok, the problem is simply with liblcms install on gcc110.
For some reason there is no liblcms.so in /usr/lib64 (although different versions of 64-bit liblcms.so.* are available there), but one in /usr/lib pointing to a 32 bit version.


---

Comment by fbissey created at 2014-01-21 18:08:54

That probably mean that there is a 64bit dev rpm not installed. But that's what I suspected.

So I finally pointed the finger to glibc/kernel headers. To build sage on SLES11SP1 and probably some other "enterprise distro" that are far behind in their toolchain stack on power7 I recommend IBM advance toolchain 7.0.3 and later.
[http://ibm.co/AdvanceToolchain](http://ibm.co/AdvanceToolchain)
It include its own glibc and that's the killer feature to get through the final issue I think. It is possible that gcc also includes a few IBM patches.
