# Issue 16800: random_subposet does not use set_random_seed

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17037

Original creator: jmantysalo

Original creation time: 2014-09-25 08:50:35

For example


```
for i in range(1,10):
    set_random_seed(42)
    print P.random_subposet(0.5)
```


shows this behaviour. Should use sage.misc.prandom.
