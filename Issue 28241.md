# Issue 28241: Include traceback when Sage crashes on startup

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28478

Original creator: roed

In #12719 (2012) we upgraded to iPython 0.13 and added a custom crash handler, which doesn't display a traceback when Sage crashes at startup.  At the time I was frustrated with the change: it's annoying to have to open up the crash log when you introduce a syntax or name error, or import something from the wrong file.  I didn't realize until this afternoon that it's trivial to include a traceback by default.

I think that it's not a problem to include the traceback even for non-developers, since the last message seen will be the current error report.

The pyflakes warning is spurious: we're importing `line_profiler` so that it's available in the shell.
