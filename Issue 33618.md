Here's some preparation, split out from #32927.

The kernel might also be missing in the wheels. Best to redo the kernelspec generation/installation similar to https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/main/setup.py#L108

When building a wheel, the symlink `doc` must be omitted but the other files should be listed as `data_files`.

I'll do this in #30298 as a follow-up.

Here's a simple solution that will suffice for #33739

Yes, that's the same issue

As you observe in #33739, this doesn't work if one simply uses pip to editable install sagelib. To also support this, I propose to run the kernelspec install as a custom `develop` cmdclass, similar to how it is currently done for `install` (extracting the kernelspec things to a mixin that can be reused). This seams to be a fairly standard way of doing it: https://github.com/search?q=kernelspec+develop++filename%3Asetup.py&type=code

Yes, this sounds like a good approach. Do you want to push to the ticket? I'm working on something else right now


---

Comment by @tobiasdiez created at 2022-05-18 13:33:47

No, I sadly don't have time for this atm.

Changing priority from major to critical.

Re-done as you suggested, works nicely.

Thanks. Code looks good to me and it seems to work (tested using #33739).

This ticket may conflict with a number of others touching the same files either in the same location or nearby locations. So some dependencies/merge order will have to be established. #32927 is already mentioned so I guess it is alright but #33838 may also clash.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-05-18 21:58:24

Test merge with #33838 succeeds without conflict

Comment by fbissey created at 2022-05-18 21:59:43

That's great, are you aware of any other tickets that touches `setup.py`s?


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2022-05-18 22:09:33

You are asking for tickets to review next? #28925
