Ah...it seems that when you use f-strings in Cython on Python 2 it returns `unicode` strings, somewhat annoyingly (but also reasonably).

Don't use Python 3 style f-strings if it will needlessly change the output type of existing functions on Python 2.

I am therefore setting back to positive

I wonder where the supposed merge conflict came from then...

I don't know why Trac does that sometimes...

Weird.  It actually will not even allow me to set the commit field.  I guess the plugin doesn't allow a commit field to be set after a ticket is closed, and is so militant about that that it will delete it if you comment on a closed ticket.
