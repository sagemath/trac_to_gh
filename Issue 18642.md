# Issue 18642: Doctests of database_gap happen to depend on gap_packages

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18879

Original creator: charpent

Original creation time: 2015-07-11 18:59:59

CC:  vbraun

Starting with 6.8beta8, these two doctests :

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_named.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 65.9 src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

fail with `database_gap` installed but succeed after installation of `gap_packages`.

This is fixed in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/pull/43

I wonder if there is a way to unify this with the branch to be reported on the ticket (well, hopefully this is not necessary).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Has anybody checked that the problem is really that those doctests themselves are the problem? i.e. do `make distclean`, install `database_gap` and check the doctests...
