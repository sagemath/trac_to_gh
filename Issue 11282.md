Applied patch to sage-4.7.1.alph2, then did 'make testlong'.  All tests passed. Then did './sage -t -only-optional=magma devel/sage/sage'.  All tests passed - with the exception of 


```
sage -t -only-optional=magma "devel/sage/sage/interfaces/magma.py"
```


which failed because of #11374.

Positive review.
