This ticket implements the fast method `is_trivial_zero` in coordinate functions (classes `sage.manifolds.coord_func.CoordFunction` and `sage.manifolds.coord_func_symb.CoordFunctionSymb`) and scalar fields (class `sage.manifolds.scalarfield.ScalarField`). The method `is_trivial_zero` is then used instead of `== 0` in tensor calculus, especially in tensor assignement, where the check for zero is performed because only nonzero components of a tensor are stored. This avoids the call to Maxima, which can be problematic in some cases, as reported in 
this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/teLBaNipBDM). Moreover, this results in a significant speed-up factor. For instance, the computation time of the coefficients of the Levi-Civita connection of the Kerr-Newman metric, as performed in cell 20 of this [example notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v1.0/SM_Kerr_Newman.ipynb), is reduced from 5.37 s to  4.11 s (this is on a Intel Core i7-6700HQ computer).
