This ticket implements the fast method `is_trivial_zero` in coordinate functions (classes `sage.manifolds.coord_func.CoordFunction` and `sage.manifolds.coord_func_symb.CoordFunctionSymb`) and scalar fields (class `sage.manifolds.scalarfield.ScalarField`). The method `is_trivial_zero` is then used instead of `== 0` in tensor calculus, especially in tensor assignement, where the check for zero is performed because only nonzero components of a tensor are stored. This avoids the call to Maxima, which can be problematic in some cases, as reported in 
this [sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/teLBaNipBDM). Moreover, this results in a significant speed-up factor.
