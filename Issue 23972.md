As reported on [this ask question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/39509/i-doesnt-belong-to-qqbar-why/):


```
sage: I in QQbar
False
```


This is because in the `__contains__` method of the `Parent` class, the big `try...except` fails when evaluating the following:


```
sage: bool(I == QQbar(I))
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1' and 'Algebraic Field'
```


This early fail does not allow further test to return `True`.
