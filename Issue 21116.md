+1 on getting rid of this kludge if we finally can!

About the change `Parent.__init__` -> `Ring.__init__`: if this does not induce complications, I would tend to use the occasion to not have `InfinityRing` inherit from `Ring` and instead pass `category=Rings()` to `Parent.__init__`.

I don't expect a need for pure speed for this parent, right? Of course the elements could still belong to `RingElement`.

Ah, shoot. That would be easy to fix by moving up those methods to
`Rings`, which anyway we want to do at some point. But then that's
starting to shift beyond the scope of this ticket.

As an intermediate step, one could keep for now the inheritance from
`Ring`, and pass a `category=Rings()` argument to `Parent`.

A `MIPVariable` is a strange thing at the moment. In particular it is mutable. Currently there is a parent class called `MIPVariableParent`. Not sure where it fits with regards to categories.

The only current changes I'd really want to keep are in `rings/infinity.py` so infinity rings properly declare their categories.

Also, from looking at the code for `MIPVariables`, the parent probably should be removed and instead `MIPVariable` just implemented as `__mul__` and `__rmul__` as a subclass of `SageObject`.
