I'm not sure that your solution is the best fix for the underlying problem.  This discrepency seems strange:

```
sage: AffineSpace(QQ,2) is AffineSpace(QQ,2)
True
sage: ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2) is ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
False
```
Maybe `AffineSpace` shouldn't be unique, for the same reasons `ProjectiveSpace` isn't?

Changing `AffineScheme` (yes, it's that high up) to `UniqueRepresentation` happened on:
https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17008

It was already predicted we'd be having unintended consequences from this and indeed here we are.

If we're keeping UniqueRepresentation, then we must make AfffineSpace immutable. In `affine_patch` we have this line:

```
        AA._default_embedding_index = i
```
(where AA is either a freshly constructed affine space or an affine space that was passed in). We can't make that change, so
* AA as an optional parameter to `affine_patch` must be removed
* `_default_embedding_index` must be a construction parameter to `AffineSpace` (if the default is "None" and the projective closure of the space is asked, a projective space should be created and the right affine patch should be forced into the projective space -- clearly projective spaces are caching their affine patches, not the other way around)
* If affine space is going to be `UniqueRep` then it should probably cache projective space rather than the other way around. We already have a problem there now:

```
sage: P2.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2);
sage: A=P2.affine_patch(2)
sage: A.projective_embedding() == P2
False
```
(the variable names get lost)
* I would recommend using something along the lines of

```
    names=[repr(a) for a in self.gens()]
    names.pop(i)
    AA = AffineSpace(n, self.base_ring(), names = names, default_embedding_index = i)
```
to get generator names. Given that we cannot make assumptions on what the variable names of the projective space are, I don't think we can do much else than just dropping the variable name whose hyperplane we're removing. If you do want to have a modification, perhaps something like

```
[repr(a)+"_aff" for a in self.gens()]
```
or so.

**EDIT:** I think we're forced to choose between the following:
* Ditch `UniqueRepresentation` on `AffineSpace`
* Ditch `default_embedding` entirely and accept that one cannot get back projective closures from affine patches (in fact that's already not really possible anyway).
* make `ProjectiveSpace` also into `UniqueRepresentation`.
The reason is that with unique rep affine spaces, we're always going to have an issue with

```
P2a.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
Aa=P2a.affine_patch(0)
P2b.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
Ab=P2b.affine_patch(0)
```
With `UniqueRepresentation`, we're going to have that Aa is identical to Ab, because there's no info to distinguish the two, so there's no room for `Aa` and `Ab` to lead back to `P2a` and `P2b` respectively.

Thanks! In fact:
{{{

That's what I originally expected to hold. It shows that A caches P2 somewhere, which makes the global modification stuff even worse.

The affine_patch function and the projective_embedding function update a dictionary object associated to the affine or projective space for caching of these associations.  So making those spaces immutable would totally break that functionality.

I personally don't like using unique representation here, but was not involved in the changes you cited that added that. Is it even reasonable to consider undoing that?

Alternatively, it seems perhaps going unique everywhere is the next alternative. But I'm not sure how hard it would be to preserve the connections between embeddings and patches.

Adding Peter Bruin, since the effects seen here are a direct result of his modifications on #17008. He might have an idea on how to fix this.

Options I see:

* Undo `UniqueRepresentation` on (some) schemes and deal with ensuing problems in another way

* Go all-the-way on making schemes `UniqueRepresentation`, which is going to take a lot of design consideration because it means they *really* need to be immutable)

I'd expect that anything in between is going to be very hard to reason about (as it turns out: anything involving `UniqueRepresentation` is hard to reason/program with in practice, because of Python's imperative streak: people get used to modifying objects)

**EDIT:** The real problem I see on #17008 is that consistent production of point sets relies on the fact that `schemes.generic.scheme.point_homset` is cached. So, in `SchemeHomset_generic.__reduce__` we need to do something along the lines of:

```
if <self> is the result of self.codomain().pointset(...):
  return PointSet,(self.codomain(),self.domain().ring_this_is_spec_of())
else:
  return what we did before
```
in order to give the cache a shot at kicking in. Once we do that, the `UniqueRepresentation` from #17008 shouldn't be necessary for the problem encountered there.

Note that this applies to *all* cached routines: once you cache something, you should rewrite the pickler to allow a chance for the cache to do the lookup for you.

Yes, but see the example in comment:3. Just keying on variable names makes things slightly better, but not sufficient. Even putting the ProjectiveSpace as part of the construction keys for the affine patches wouldn't save us because

```
sage: ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)==ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
True
```

`UniqueRepresentation` is like a virus ...

> But if we go this route (which I'm not yet convinced of) then we'd still need to think about what things should be immutable and how that affects the connection between patches and embeddings. Not to mention fixing some of those examples involving subschemes which should also be unique by the same argument.


I'm not so sure that the same argument applies: While subschemes of affine schemes may be affine again (and hence a spec of something), that's not how they are constructed in your examples. Since they are not primarily "the spec" of a ring to begin with, I don't think there's the same urgency. Obviously, spec of the coordinate ring would hopefully give the subscheme back, but I'm not sure we're supporting that, and I think we could live without that (for now).

That being said, it seems that having some schemes `UR` and other not is going to be incredibly painful.

A useful way to store the patches/embeddings, which allows us to keep `UniqueRepresentation` for affine schemes (I am strongly in favour of keeping unique representation for the reason Nils mentioned in comment;10) would be the "structure" construction that is currently used for number fields (introduced by Julian Rüth in #11670).

The idea of "structure" is the following: number fields have unique representation, but the defining data of a number field includes an optional description of how it relates to another number field.  In this way, you can create a number field either on its own or (for example) as a subfield of a different number field.  See `sage/rings/number_field/structure.py` for details.

That construction is a complete memory leak. For instance:

```
sage: u=id(NumberField(x^2+1,name="a").absolute_field('b'))
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
65
sage: [type(v) for v in gc.get_objects() if id(v)==u]
[<class 'sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_quadratic_with_category'>]
```

This leaks for the following reason. If we do:

```
sage: K.<a>=NumberField(x^2+1)
sage: L.<b>=K.absolute_field()
sage: L._structure._reduction[1][0] is K
True
```
We see that `L` has a strong link to `K`. So `L` will now keep `K` alive. What's more, via `sage.rings.number_field.number_field.NumberField_version2._cache` there's now a strong global link to `K` as a key in a `WeakValueDictionary` with value `L`, so as long as `L` is alive, `K` will be reachable (and not just part of a cycle).

So, if `K` somehow references `L` then `K` and `L` will not be collected. And here it is:

```
sage: K._cache__absolute_field.values()[0] is L
True
```

Note that in principle it's fine for `L` and `K` to reference each other: the cyclic garbage collector will find those dead cycles just fine. The problem is that by using any of `L` and `K` as part of a key in a `UniqueFactory` or similar, you're getting a strong reference to the cycle. So the key now keeps the value in the `WeakValueDictionary` alive.

An important part of the problem is a double caching strategy: `UniqueFactory` already provides caching. `absolute_field` implements its own cache. With the introduction of `structure` the first caching has been made a little better. But that now clashes with the second caching.

The situation might be slightly better if `absolute_field` were non-caching, but it could well be that the required computations to arrive at the key under which the other cache operates are now too expensive. One of the reasons why `UniqueRepresentation` etc. is so insidious is because it forces a caching strategy in one place, which precludes caching from being used elsewhere.

In this case a solution could be to implement `absolute_field` as:

```
@cached_method
def compute_absolute_field_data(...):
...

def absolute_field(...):
   data = self.compute_absolute_field_data(...)
   L = NumberField(data,...)
   return L
```
so that the expensive data gets stored without creating or referencing the field that can be constructed with it.

This is already how `absolute_field()` is implemented; `data` is the absolute defining polynomial, which is computed and cached by the method `absolute_polynomial()`.  Removing the ``@`cached_method` decorator from `NumberField_{generic,relative}.absolute_field()` solves the memory leak in your example:

```
sage: u=id(NumberField(x^2+1,name="a").absolute_field('b'))
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
53
sage: [type(v) for v in gc.get_objects() if id(v)==u]
[]

- I don't understand why the parameters were added to the subsheme init. It seems like these cannot be different than the ambient space

```
algebraic subscheme:
def __init__(self, A, polynomials, ambient_projective_space=None,
                 default_embedding_index=None):
```

- Do we want to set-up a ProjectiveScheme class like the AffineScheme class?

- The default should be immutable

```
P.<x,y,z>=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
A.<u,v> = AffineSpace(2,QQ,ambient_projective_space=P,default_embedding_index=0)
A._default_embedding_index=4
A.projective_embedding()

Most objects are semantically immutable, not syntactically (i.e., it does not raise an error when you do mutate it). The user is not suppose to access `_coordinate_ring` because it starts with a leading underscore. So as far as the user is concerned, the object is immutable. So you should not be changing these things in code (which is part of the problem here).

As mentioned above, this is basically a red herring and irrelevant.

The doc string

```
         If the dehomogenized morphism is an endomorphism then a
         :class:`DynamicalSystem_affine` given by dehomogenizing the
         source and target of `self` with respect to the given indices.

```
could be simpler. It is totally dependent on the indicies, so something more like
If the dehomogenizing indices are the same for the domain and codomain, then
a dynamical system is returned. If the dehomogenizing indicies for the domain and codomain are different then the resulting affine patches are different and a scheme morphism is returned

Also 
I'd rather have a specific check than a blanket try/except

```
        try:
            return F.as_dynamical_system()
        except:
            return F

I don't see anything outright that would cause a memory leak. Is there some infinite sequence that would be reasonable test?

I agree with Ben's comment:36 overall.

In principle, I don't think you can create different Specs from the construction parameters (unless you did something evil, probably involving some monkey-patching too). This is because the two extra parameters default to `None` and do not change. Now you will get unequal (because they are non-identical) affine patches if they have different embeddings/projective spaces, but from the ticket description, I am inferring they are only isomorphic, which is okay. However, I don't know the math, so I might need a little more detail about what sort of behavior you expect.

I do have some other comments on the branch:

You should not change what the test in `homset.py` is actually testing. So you need to find a new parent that is not unique and construct its `End`. This is something I might be able to do, but hopefully someone following this ticket knows a good example.

In `affine_subscheme.py`, your added `__init__` is missing doctests.

A while-we-are-at-it, can you change the doc of specialization in `generic/morphism.py` to be properly formatted (by de-indenting the `::`)?

Your `__classcall__` is missing doctests (create two objects with not-identical but equivalent entries and show they are the same by using `is`).

This change is suspicious to me:

Is the default embedding index and morphism of `U` set automatically? Before it didn't seem like it did, and I am not sure you're changes make it so.

You can simplify this:

```diff
-gens = [g[j] for j in range(i)] + [g[j] for j in range(i+1, n+1)]

```

With passing in `AA` to `affine_patch`, what if `AA._default_embedding_index` is not equal to `i`? This feels like it will put things into an inconsistent state as that corresponding `AA` is stored and used again. (Side note: this lazily construct `__affine_patches = {}` makes the code way more complicated than it needs to be for no gain IMO.)

Don't you need to do some changes in `affine_space.py` for `projective_embedding` to take into account the `_default_embedding_index` and `_ambient_projective_space`?

I don't understand why you added this:

```
+    i = default_embedding_index
+    if i is not None:
+        i = int(i)
```
Such a check should be done in the `AffineSpace_generic.__init__` method because that is where is it "used" (basically a code-locality reason).

Instead of having a check like this:

It would be better to set `self._embedding_morphism = None` in the `__init__` and then check

```python

It is easier to understand the program flow and makes it easier to debug (mainly, when people do typos).

affine_patch function takes the embedding index as input, unlike `Affine_Space`,in `Affine_Subschemes` this embedding index is a necessary input. ie it cannot be None, so there is no need for `_default_embedding_index`.

> With passing in AA to affine_patch, what if AA._default_embedding_index is not equal to i? This feels like it will put things into an inconsistent state as that  corresponding AA is stored and used again.


I don't really know how to deal with that, someone on top of the ticket suggested that `AA` as a parameter should be remove, to which I agree.

> (Side note: this lazily construct `__affine_patches = {}` makes the code way more complicated than it needs to be for no gain IMO.)


construction of most of these variable is done in similar way, any better method?


> Don't you need to do some changes in affine_space.py for projective_embedding to take into account the _default_embedding_index and _ambient_projective_space?


I have taken then into account, any specific change, which I am missing?

Yes, but does the `subscheme` your are constructing have the correct embedding index/morphism? I didn't necessarily see a mechanism to set these things. It is possible I missed something, but it might be a problem if not.

Then you probably should remove it (well, deprecate it). Another option would be to raise an error if such an `AA` was going to take it into an inconsistent state.

Yes (IMO), initialize these during the `__init__`. Actually, there is a very small speed gain once it is constructed to having it the way it is now. Although I wonder if these methods would be better served by making them ``@`cached_method` or putting those attributes as an ``@`lazy_attribute`.

I don't think so.

I guess there is also a bit of a question of "Should you be able to construct an `AffineSpace` without an (default) `_ambient_projective_space`?"

Just commenting on two points here

- Doesn't this code in __init__ for subscheme set the correct default index. I thought I tested this in the notebook and the subschemes were getting the correct default embeddings.

```
AlgebraicScheme_subscheme.__init__(self, A, polynomials)
if A._ambient_projective_space is not None:
    self._embedding_morphism = self.projective_embedding \
       (A._default_embedding_index, A._ambient_projective_space)
else:
    self._embedding_morphism = None
```

- in regards to: "Should you be able to construct an AffineSpace without an (default) _ambient_projective_space?"

If the answer here should be "no", there isn't a canonical way to choose a default embedding so you'd need to require the user to specify. The current code takes the answer as yes and has default embedding optional. From a mathematical perspective, an affine space is certainly an independent object and does not need to be attached to a projective space. Each of the possible embeddings is in some sense equally good.

To me this is very similar to the number field question. When you create a number field in Sage you have the option of specifying how it is embedded in CC (or QQBar etc). There are a number of choices for this embedding which are all in some sense equally good, and without user input, there is no "canonical" choice for this.
