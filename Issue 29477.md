I'm always worried by these shorthand checks. Checking that a list has members seems much more clearly expressed by `if len(L):`. For instance, `if L:` does not distinguish between `L=[]` and `L=None`, whereas `if L != []:` does.

So, I think you need to be pretty sure that L really is a list before making such changes. I see in some of the code fragments that's pretty obviously the case, so then the change is fine, but I'd be concerned when I were making such a change across a whole bunch of code I'd overlook some corner case. Aren't you?

Logically there is a difference between the replacements


```
-            while ret[-1] != []:
+            while ret[-1]:
```


and


```
-                if arg == []:
+                if not arg:
```


In the latter case a `None` can slip through after the change, in the former it cannot (but it could before). So from a formal point of view, the first replacement is an improvement, the second a regression, and they are clearly distinguished by the apperance of `not`.

However, from an operational viewpoint, it is hard to imagine an unexpected `None` generating a silent error, at least in my experience. So one could adopt a legalistic attitude: whosoever overloads the `bool()` built-in should expect it to be used as in these optimizations.
