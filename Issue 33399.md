# Issue 33399: replace loadable_module_extension() by importlib.machinery.EXTENSION_SUFFIXES

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33636

Original creator: tornaria

Original creation time: 2022-04-03 12:28:15

After #33626, `loadable_module_extension()` is only used twice in `sage.misc.cython.cython()`.

For these I have this tentative change:

Notes:
 - The option `use_cache=True` is only used in `sage.repl.load.load_cython()` and I'm not sure there's any doctest that will run this code.
 - The option `create_local_so_file=True` is not used anywhere, and it's not doctested either.
 - If both options are given together and the compiled `*.so` file is found in cache, it will //not// save a copy in the current directory (seems to be a bug).

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Committed the patch above just for convenience. Not sure if this is ready, it's probably desirable to add some direct tests for these options.

Can you also please deprecate `loadable_module_extension`?

+1 on adding a doctest for `create_local_so_file=True`
