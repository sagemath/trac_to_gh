Some optional suggestions while we are at it, but they can wait too.

While fixing "ambiguous" spelling, also change capitalisation.

```diff
-            ValueError: Input is ambiguous: x as well as raw_element=42 are specified.
+            ValueError: input is ambiguous: x as well as raw_element=42 are specified.
...
-            raise ValueError('Input is ambiguous: '
+            raise ValueError('input is ambiguous: '
```


While fixing "guarentee" -> "guarantee", also fix "there is not" -> "there is no"
and single or no backticks to double backticks.

```diff
-         - A tuple (a, b, c) which satisfies `a = b*f + c*g`. There
-           is not guarantee that a, b, and c are minimal.
+         - A tuple ``(a, b, c)`` which satisfies ``a = b*f + c*g``. There
+           is no guarantee that ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are minimal.
```


Mis-spelled "seperate" incorrectly fixed to "saperate", should be "separate".

```diff
-    We can represent the Berkovich projective line in two saperate ways:
+    We can represent the Berkovich projective line in two separate ways:
```


Fix "exceeds" as well as "allotted" (twice).

```diff
-        However, if the Newton iteration exceedes the allotted attempts,
+        However, if the Newton iteration exceeds the allotted attempts,
```


Finally, whenever touching `%` or `.format(...)` string formatting,
I would go f-strings, but up to you since you're doing the work!
