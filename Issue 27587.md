do not install pythonX if we are in the virtenv of pythonX.

At the moment I don't know how feasible it is - one small obstacle might be that we really do not want to mess with two pythons at the same time.

For Python packages when installing using the system Python we definitely need a well thought out approach, likely with different options for handling questions such as where to install additional Python packages.

`$SAGE_LOCAL` *already* acts as a sort-of virtualenv, but we might still consider using virtualenv/venv in `$SAGE_LOCAL` (with the `--system-site-packages` option) as a way of extending `sys.path` while still using as many system Python packages as possible.

after this fix, it builds and passes most tests on Gentoo (some errors related to cryptominisat that I had installed, and it probably got broken in some way)

I see (on a system where cryptominisat package works) that it is one of few packages that get installed without a sub-directory named the same as package in site-packages:

```
sage: import pycryptosat
sage: print(pycryptosat.__file__)

sage: import numpy

Not sure whether this is a bug on the package, or a bug in this branch.
On this branch I see (with `local=SAGE_LOCAL`)

```
$ ls local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/*
local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pycryptosat-0.2.0-py3.7.egg-info  local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pycryptosat.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

So it seems that this branch does not pick up anything from that location.

Hello everyone,

When trying to upgrade to 9.1.rc5, I'm seeing an issue that I suspect could be a side effect of this ticket.

For some reason my `sage/local/bin/python3.7` was a symlink to the system python binary. Sage decided it wanted to install its own python-3.7.3.p1, but that failed with a permission error on the symlink. After deleting the symlink, python builds and installs correctly. (I let the logs be overwritten, so I won't be able to provide much details — sorry.)

The overall Sage build still fails with an error about six not being found while building setuptools that I haven't yet investigated.
