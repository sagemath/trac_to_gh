LGTM. (Trivial nitpick: `self` -> ```self```, but I won't hold this up for a hidden function.)

And if you agree, perhaps we can also fix the ones from #25591 while were're at it.

Sure, thanks!  It's still pretty trivial but in these cases I think that's okay!

Ah, I thought something about this seemed familiar though: #25389

But per my comment, we decided not to go forward with my use of `UniqueRepresentation` from #25389.  Instead we need some kind of class that shares some of the equality/hash implementation of `UniqueRepresentation` without the caching/singleton semantics.

I think if we had that it would make a lot of these `__hash__`es irrelevant.  But currently lacking such a class (I could write it pretty easily I think, but haven't yet) this is fine as a workaround for now.

Let's put a hold on doing any more `__hash__`es, just for a few days, to give me a chance to implement that hypothetical class.  I don't think I'll have time today but I should be able to do it early next week.
