we probably need to overhaul Homebrew actions quite a bit. There are various obsolete things, e.g. a  macOS version is 11.0 instead of 11, something funny with an old version 11.7 of xcode, etc...

It seems to me that Homebrew packages need explicit installation, too.

Also, homebrew has recently (again!) broken their python3. Because they hardcode the path to the SDK sysroot, it only works when the current Xcode command line tools are installed

Is this why `cython` is failing to compile with messages like

```
  clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.sdk' [-Wmissing-sysroot]
```

(Failing with homebrew's Python 3, builds okay with /usr/bin/python3.)
