# Issue 28639: Polyhedron: Let affine hull fully respect backend

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28876

Keywords: polytopes, backend, affine hull

The method affine hull does not preserve backend, when `orthogonal` or `orthonormal` is `True`.

We fix this.

`normaliz` should be able to handle most base rings that appear with this method, so this is mostly usefull for the backend `normaliz`.
