Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I believe this is a feature of "new" matplotlib.  See [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/ticker_api.html#matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter) and in particular the "Notes" and the [figure](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/ticker_api-1.png) which clearly shows this.  See also ticket:7964 and [this sage-devel discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/s39WysaG0fI).

Not just related, but probably something that can fix this, once we fix that the 1e6 stuff is gone completely anyway (related to #7964, again).
