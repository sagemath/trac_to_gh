```
sage: G = Graph({1:[2,3,4]})
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-aa626427af43> in <module>()
----> 1 sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'graph_plot'
sage: G.plot()
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 8 graphics primitives
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'
sage: 
```


I.e. I can set up default options for graph plotting, but only after making at least one plot.

So the bug is that you have to import the module first? The reason why the second call works is that `.plot()` loads it for you.

Changing component from group theory to graph theory.

Hmmmmm.. I think that the DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS dictionary actually gives its data to GraphPlot.show, and not to GenericGraph.show.

Changing component from graph theory to documentation.

I suggest adding an `import`-line before first example of using `DEFAULT_SHOW_OPTIONS`.
