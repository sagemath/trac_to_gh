sage: G = Graph({1:[2,3,4]})
sage: sage.graphs.graph_plot.DEFAULT_PLOT_OPTIONS['vertex_shape'] = 's'

```


I.e. I can set up default options for graph plotting, but only after making at least one plot.

So the bug is that you have to import the module first? The reason why the second call works is that `.plot()` loads it for you.
