# Issue 14428: make generic_graph.plot() pass its options to show

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Essentially what the title says. If it doesn't support the option, then there are two ways it can be handled:
1. it will give an error from show just like the other plot functions do.
2. it will check the dict from sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.SHOW_DEFAULT and raise an error from the generic_graph.plot() or generic_graph.graphplot() itself.

See also #13891, where some of the behavior there should be reverted a little.

Added a patch. Please check that none of your graph plots are broken :)

Hmmmm... What can we do about that ?

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().plot(aewarehaerhaerherh=8)
```


This is the line that used to return a warning

```
sage: graphs.PetersenGraph().plot(aewaerh=8)
/home/ncohen/.Sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py:14263: DeprecationWarning: You provided aewaerh as an argument to a function which has always silently ignored its inputs. This method may soon be updated so that the method raises an exception instead of this warning, which will break your code : to be on the safe side, update it !
See http://trac.sagemath.org/13891 for details.
  return GraphPlot(graph=self, options=options)
```


Could we check that all arguments given as input are actually used somewhere ?

Added a check for incorrect arguments. I check against `graphplot_options` and the show options that are already extracted.

Thanks. You should learn some of the graph_ics_ code too! Then you can review my patches `;-)`. Anyway, I updated the patch with a [one character change](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/commit/3beb2941461e94a45fec0e1f233e3c6f93fd1fc7) that I didn't notice for days.

Can we submit GIT patches already ? `O_o`

unfortunately, no. That's just my repo to keep track of my patches. I need to apply a bunch of them every time I need to do any work.

Oh. Do you have many patches waiting for a review ?

Well, some of them are trivial but some are not so trivial :)

You can get the numbers from the [file names here](https://github.com/ppurka/sage-patches/tree/master/sage_devel).

As for the patches themselves, I would say that

1. You can ignore the first six patches because the first two were being reviewed, while the next four will probably never get in.
2. Trivial patch: #13690
3. For improving consistency the tickets are #14229, #13834, #13660
4. For my own work, I always need to apply #13422, #13528, #14580, #12798 (which is slow _during doctesting_ on Solaris and has no future of getting in), and the type1-fonts (which I haven't made into a proper patch),
5. New features: #13246, #14580, #14112, #13576

(I just realized that two of them should have been set to needs review!)
