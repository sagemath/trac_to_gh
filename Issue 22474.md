CC:  fbissey cremona jdemeyer

`clang++` refuses to guess the correct `return` statement. Also, `delete[]` must not be mixed up with `delete`. This ticket fixes these issues, and allows #22679 to go forward.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22711

John, it seems that a large part of it is already in your https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib

Perhaps you can just pick what's not yet there from the patch, and make a new release...

OK perhaps, but not until next week.  I am very receptive to pull requests into eclib.  I am strongly opposed to patching eclib for Sage independently of that.

Note also that there has been a new release of eclib for several weeks waiting for a positive review --jdemeyer got close but then it got forgotten.

Please change the "no feedback yet" tag -- this is feedback.

The patch here catches one more missing `[]` in delete (thus a memory leak) in `libsrc/newforms.cc` (after line 1665), a missing `return bd;` just after line 109 in `libsrc/htconst.cc` (something which `clang++ 3.8` does not forgive you, resulting in lots of errors).

So these absolutely must be fixed.

There is also some more, regarding shifting negative values (undefined behavour in C++).

For the latter, I haven't done the complete job---it appears to be still working without it. Let's complete this fixing, cause it's just trouble in waiting to hit after a compiler update...
One should start off #22164, naturally.

in the diff fragment below `#define QS_LONG_MASK (~(-1L<<QS_LONG_SHIFT))`
is such an example; putting extra pair of brackets as done in the diff fixes this.

This matches one from ratpoints I fixed some time ago. But there are more, hopefully equally unambiguous. 

It's more problematic if you do `x<<y` for x a signed variable;

That's unfortunate -- this code was adapted from a (now very old) version of ratpoints, and that sort of macro is not my style at all.

I am not sure what to do next, so I will push the changes I already made to github.

Now which country did you grow up in, I seem to have forgotten?

Running ptestlong gives only these:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/calculus/interpolators.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/calculus/riemann.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/matrix/matrix_double_dense.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
sage -t --long --warn-long 111.3 src/sage/finance/time_series.pyx  # Timed out (and interrupt failed)
```

none of w3hich are related to eclib -- and it's a beta release which I had not tested with the old eclib.
