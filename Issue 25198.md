This is part of the meta-ticket #22982. 

The goal of the present ticket is to add code for computing finite and infinite maximal orders and ideals thereof. The central engine for computing maximal orders is the Leonard-Pellikaan-Singh-Swanson algorithm implemented in Singular. Most algorithms for computing with ideals are from Cohen's book  A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory.

The code of this patch was written more than two years ago.  It might be the case that the normal.lib was then an experimental package. But I don't remember well.

Another reason that may still be relevant now is that the normalP in the singular library does more computations than necessary for my case. For example, it also computes delta invariants of the given ideal. So I decided to make a stripped-down light version of normalP just for the code in this ticket.

I am trying this approach. During computation, the Singular's version spits out many comments, each line starting with `//`, causing doctest failures. Do you know how to deal with this?

- You don't need to cache `ideal_monoid`, at least the `IdealMonoid` class is better as a `UniqueRepresentation`.
- Error messages should start with a lowercase letter (as per our convention).
- Some little doc formatting things:
  {{{#!diff
         - ``gens`` -- list of elements that are a basis for the
-             ideal over the maximal order of the base field
+           ideal over the maximal order of the base field
  }}}
  {{{#!diff
- ``gens`` -- list of generators or an ideal in a ring which coerces
-          to this order.
+          to this order
  }}}
- Some micro-optimizations:
  {{{#!diff
-        basis = [V(sigma_a_pow[j]*beta_pow[i]) for i in range(s) for j in range(r)]
+        basis = [V(sap * bp) for bp in beta_pow for sap in sigma_a_pow]
         W = V.span_of_basis(basis)
 
         def to_K(f):
             coeffs = (f % q).list()
-            return sum([sigma(coeffs[i]) * beta_pow[i] for i in range(len(coeffs))], K.zero())
+            return sum((sigma(c) * beta_pow[i] for i, c in enumerate(coeffs)), K.zero())
 
         if r == 1: # take care of the prime field case
             def fr_K(g):
                 co = W.coordinates(V(g),check=False)
                 return R([k(co[j]) for j in range(s)])
         else:
-            t = r * s
             def fr_K(g):

+                return R([k(co[i:i+r]) for i in range(0,r*s,r)])
  }}}
  (well, the last changes are for readability, less variables to keep track of).
- Micro-optimization: in `mul_vecs`, you might want to move `self._mtable[i]` part out of the `for j in range(n):` loop to avoid the extra lookups.
- I think it is bad form to use raises of errors to dictate program flow. I think a better way in `_ideal_from_vectors_and_denominator` (which should be faster too) is to have
  {{{#!python

                    for c in l:
                        g = g.gcd(c)
                        if g.is_one():
                            break
                    else:
                        M += l
                        continue
                    break
                else:
                    d = d // g
                    mat = matrix(R, len(vecs), [c // g for c in M])
  }}}
  where the `else` block is run iff the loop did not run to completion. You could also dispatch this to an internal function that would return `mat` or `None` upon failure.
- Is there a clear benefit to having `mtable` a list of vectors, as opposed to a list of lists or a `Matrix` object?
- Isn't this block of the `div` in Buchman-Lenstra algorithm just the same as `mul_vec`?
  {{{
                        c = 0
                        for i in range(n):

                                c += a[i] * b[j] * mtable[i][j]
  }}}
  Perhaps there would be a benefit from cythonizing `mul_vec` considering how frequently it is used.

The code seems to be intended to support these three cases:

```
L.order_infinite_with_basis([1/x,1/x*y, 1/x^2*y^2])

L.order_infinite_with_basis([1/x])

L.order_infinite_with_basis(1/x)

But this is not described in the docstring. Also this is not consistent with `order_with_basis`. Hence I will remove the responsible code from `order_infinite_with_basis`. Happily, there is no doctest failure because of this.

Orders created with a basis do have unique representation behavior. They could have cached representation behavior. But I don't see a reason to force this.

Equation orders can have unique representation behavior. But I leave them just to be cached. I don't see a compelling reason to avoid using ``@`cached_method` for these. Do you have?

Thank you.

They are subclasses of `Parent`, correct? Things work faster/better in regard to, say, coercion and equality with `UniqueRepresentation`. It is also faster to compare for equality and hash (just use the `id` in both cases). Speaking of which, because of the MRO, it is better to have `UniqueRepresentation` as the first class.

There was a typo here. I meant:

`Order_basis` class does *not* have unique representation behavior. It could have cached representation behavior. But I don't see a reason to force this.

I agree. But `EquationOrder(Infinite)` class is something that I do not expect to be subclassed. Anyway now it occurs to me that I can just get rid of this class, and use the superclass`Order_basis`.

This is not my code. But it seems not a bug to me.  The intention is to force base to `self` (a rational function field) if given, since `self` is the only reasonable base field for a rational function field. If F is a rational function field,

```

For the first two cases, the cache key is `None`. On the other hand, `base**1` creates a vector space over `base` of dimension 1.

It is for consistency. Note that general function fields also have `vector_space`, for which it is reasonable to take a `base` argument. Thus, perhaps, one can write generic code for function fields, rational or not. This is not my design.

Fair enough. I only really noticed it because of the refactoring.

I think the only last thing to do is to have a doctest in each of the `__init__` methods that simply created the corresponding object and runs `TestSuite(foo).run()`. Otherwise, I think that takes care of everything. Thank you.

It was instructive to add `TestSuites` for all parents. I could finally understand the basics of the interplay of Parents, Elements, and Categories. Thank you.

I am glad to hear you were able to learn some new stuff. It looks like you were able to reduce the redundancy.

I have a few additional small comments:

Error messages should not be proper sentences (so not starting with a capital letter and ending with a period/full-stop):

```diff
-        if n != 0: raise IndexError("Only one generator.")
+        if n != 0:
+            raise IndexError("only one generator")
         return self._gen
```

(This is a general Python convention.)
Same also for `raise IndexError("Only {} generators".format(self.ngens()))`.

These type of changes do not seem to be correct to me:

```
        m = self.ideal_monoid()
        m.Element = FunctionFieldIdeal_rational
```

The `Element` attribute should be set by the corresponding parent before `Parent.__init__` is called, as does the appropriate setup (e.g., constructing `element_class`). The thing do do would be to have a hook (via a attribute) that is looked at by `IdealMonoid` in its `__init__` which then sets its `Element` attribute, e.g.:

```
self.Element = R._ideal_class
```

Also, is there a use-case for someone to pass an `ideal_class` to `ideal` or `ideal_with_gens_over_base`? If so, then this hook I mentioned above should be removed and the `ideal_class` should instead be an additional construction parameter for `IdealMonoid`.

Trivial formatting:

```diff
         - ``gens`` -- list of elements that are a basis for the
-              ideal over the maximal order of the base field
+          ideal over the maximal order of the base field
```


If you want to enforce a particular subcategory for input, you can do:

```diff
-category or IntegralDomains()
+category = IntegralDomains().or_subcategory(category)
```

(for `None`, this becomes `IntegralDomains()`).

I can also look into why the facade parents are not behaving well once the above is done.

> I will take care of other comments after a week long national holidays. 

No problem. Enjoy your holidays.

The function field orders are facade parents, because the parent of elements of an order is just the function field. What seems to me a bug is that  some category tests intended for normal parents are still applied to facade parents. For example, `_test_one`, `_test_zero`.

I guess `_gens_over_base` was introduced for efficiency when I implemented "places" and "divisors" on top of orders and ideals. As that is not needed here, I removed it. I may reintroduce it in a later ticket.

It is a list of a list of vectors.

Locating parts to be cythonized is a general issue that I should tackle some day, after learning more cython.
