CC:  @tobiasdiez dimpase slabbe nbruin egourgoulhon slelievre

(from #29536)

This is like `_recommended`, but for development tools.

Define a script package representing "useful stuff to have on a Docker image" (more than the `_recommended` package from #29557)
- include the stuff added in #33740 to `environment-dev.yml` and #33671
- solve #27677, #29153

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33851

The environment files are only one way that this information is provided to the user. Other ways are through the command-lines shown at the end of `./configure`, and in the formatted documentation https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/index.html

That's why it is better to separate the data from the code that processes data.
