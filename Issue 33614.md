# Issue 33614: Script package _develop

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33851

(from #29536)

This is like `_recommended`, but for development tools.

Define a script package representing "useful stuff to have on a Docker image" (more than the `_recommended` package from #29557)
   - include the stuff added in #33740 to `environment-dev.yml` and #33671
   - solve #27677, #29153

What's the point of introducing a file `_develop/conda.txt` whose content is only used in `bootstrap-conda` instead of hardcoding the content there? Consistency doesn't really out-weight the additional complexity in my opinion.

Well, there's also _develop/distros/debian.txt and more to be added.

These files are also used when configure generates information messages for the user etc.

Replying to [comment:11 gh-tobiasdiez]:

The environment files are only one way that this information is provided to the user. Other ways are through the command-lines shown at the end of `./configure`, and in the formatted documentation https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/index.html

That's why it is better to separate the data from the code that processes data.

By the way, what was the rationale for adding `pycodestyle` (but not other linters) to `environment-dev.yml`?
