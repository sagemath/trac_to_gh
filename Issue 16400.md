# Issue 16400: has_finite_order of EllipticCurvePoint performs useless computations

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16637

Original creator: sbesnier

Original creation time: 2014-07-09 14:49:58

The method `meth::EllipticCurvePoint_finite_field.has_finite_order` essentially computes the order of the point, which is quite inefficient (the answer is always `True`).

`ElliptiCurvePoint_finite_field` should overload this method in order to returns True evrytime.

Needs to be rebased. Also, you need a blank line after `EXAMPLES::`.
