```
matsolvemod(M,D,B,{flag=0}): one solution of system of congruences 
MX=B mod D (M matrix, B and D column vectors). If (optional) flag is
non-null return all solutions.
```


should allow to implement A.solve_right for matrices over Z/nZ.

It seems like one would first have to add matsolvemod as a method in the gen class. (Or use the interface...).

I've added http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14391 so that one can access matsolvemod through the C-library interface. However, I now remember William telling me you can solve equations in *Z*/n*Z* using the code he wrote for finitely generated modular over a PID. And you can. It would be nice to use that implementation for A.solve_right.

Okay, I've written a patch for this! Using pari is significantly faster than using the f.g. modules over a PID code, so the patch depends on #14391. This patch applies onto sage 5.8 and all doctests passed (using --testall --long).

Changing keywords from "" to "solve_right, matsolvemod, Zmod".

Can you post some timings comparing the two approaches (I am curious about larger dimensions & bitsizes)? The patch itself looks fine to me.

Here are some times (I temporarily added a method .solve_left_slow that uses the f.g. over a pid code; the latter naturally does things on the left):

I also attached a code snippet of .solve_left_slow to this ticket for transparency and posterity!

Snippet of the f.g. modules over a PID implementation. This is much slower and only included for you curious people out there.

Okay, that convinces me.
