# Issue 23580: bridges method of Graph is sometimes wrong

Issue created by migration from Trac.

```
sage: G = Graph()
sage: G.add_edge(0,1)
sage: G.bridges()
[]
```

Though the edge indeed disconnects the graph!

This is particularly annoying in the following situation

```
sage: G = Graph(loops=True)
sage: G.add_edge(0,0)
sage: G.add_edge(0,1)
sage: G.add_edge(1,1)
sage: G.bridges()
[]
```
