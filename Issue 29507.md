The paper is unclear for the line `Select x such that d(u, x) + e(x) = e(u)`. In fact, this is method minES in the paper.

Since we don't know e(x), we do as follows (a `while True` loop):
1. Select x minimizing e_L(x) and such that d(u, x) + e_L(x) <= e(u).
2. Compute e(x) and update `LB`.
3. If e(x) = e_L(x), then x a good choice. We use it to update eccentricity upper bounds. Then we break from the while loop.
3. Otherwise, x was not a good choice. We use its antipode to update lower bounds. Then, we go to 1.

It might be suitable to maintain the list of vertices from which we have not yet computed a BFS.


Don't forget to add this ticket in the meta ticket. Also, I have not checked if a previously opened ticket was trying to implement the same algorithm...

It unclear to me, how we should use list of active vertices. Can you explain this part, so I can work on it.

let active be the list of vertices

while True, do:
1. let idx be the index of the vertex in active with largest eccentricity upper bound
2. active[idx], active[-1] = active[-1], active[idx]   # exchange 
3. source = active.pop()   # source is no longer active
4. compute BFS from source, set ecc[source] and update eccentricity lower bounds
5. apply minES as described in #comment:4.
   - Each time you select a vertex x in active, you remove it from active.
   - Warning: when you select the antipode, may be it is no longer active, and so cannot be removed from active. This is something hard to avoid. But you can use it anyway. So check if the antipode is in active and if so remove it.


Hope it helps.

I have update my method as you mentioned. But there is no improvement in performance.\\

One major drawback of our code is that sometimes it never comes out of inner while loop. This happens, because there is no vertex in `active` list which satisfies the condition `distances[v] + ecc_lower_bound[v] <= ecc[source]` and hence the continuous popping from `active` list\\

We have to figure out a way to deal with this situation when there is no such vertex in `active` list

I have following suggestions:
- If intially there is no vertex in `active` list, which satisfies the condition, then we should use `source` as its `delegate certificate`
- If after entering inner while loop there is no vertex in `active` list which satisfies the condition, then we should use last `x` as `delegate certificate`

I pushed a new branch with a different version of the algorithm. For me it's better and it is generally faster than iFUB.
I have also renamed the algorithm as `DHV` instead of `diameter_dragan`. The branch is in public, so you can modify it.

- First of all, I would like to mention, it is very clean, efficient and simplified code :)

- One problem, I encountered was that it was giving index error as follows

```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import diameter
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(21,0.6)
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'DHV')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

IndexError: list index out of range
CPU times: user 512 µs, sys: 27 µs, total: 539 µs
Wall time: 470 µs
0
```


I have fixed that.
\\
\\
- I agree, it sometimes works faster than iFUB. 
Few examples that I would like to point out, where it perform equivalent to brute are - 


```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(1009,0.6)
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'standard')
CPU times: user 673 ms, sys: 7.41 ms, total: 681 ms
Wall time: 679 ms

sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'DHV')
CPU times: user 648 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 648 ms
Wall time: 647 ms
2
sage: % time diameter(G)
CPU times: user 346 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 346 ms
Wall time: 345 ms
2
```




```
sage: G = graphs.BubbleSortGraph(7)
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'standard')
CPU times: user 530 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 530 ms
Wall time: 529 ms
21
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'DHV')
CPU times: user 580 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 580 ms
Wall time: 580 ms
21
sage: % time diameter(G)
CPU times: user 276 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 276 ms
Wall time: 276 ms
21
```




```
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'standard')
CPU times: user 359 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 359 ms
Wall time: 358 ms
6
sage: % time diameter(G, algorithm = 'DHV')
CPU times: user 374 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 374 ms
Wall time: 373 ms
6
sage: % time diameter(G)
CPU times: user 297 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 297 ms
Wall time: 296 ms
6
```


Maybe above graphs are the worst cases of this algorithm.

if we need to add `active` in the outer while loop, it means that we are not correctly maintaining LB and UB. Indeed, if active is empty, it means that we have computed BFS from all the vertices. So we must have LB = UB. Can you check that ?

For the performance, try a large sparse graph, or `graphs.RandomBarabasiAlbert(100000, 2)`.

You are right, we need to add `active` as a test of the outer while loop. This is typically the case for a graph with 2 vertices and an edge. I added a dockets for this case.

May be we should rename the method `diameter_DHV` to be consistent, no ?

You can now make this method available from the diameter method in `graph.py`.

You should add a doctest with a weighted graph in boost.


```
sage: from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import diameter_DHV
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(6)
sage: for u, v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.set_edge_label(u, v, 1)
sage: G.set_edge_label(4, 5, -1)
sage: diameter_DHV(G)  # unweighted
3.0
sage: diameter_DHV(G, weight_function=lambda e:e[2])   # weighted 
0.0
```

This last answer is not correct.

Other issues, that were certainly already here.

This happens because instead of detecting negative cycle, `Bellman-Ford` is returning negative distances :(

```
sage: from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import shortest_paths
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(6)
sage: shortest_paths(G,0, weight_function = lambda e:e[2])[0]
{0: -2, 1: -1, 2: 0, 3: -3, 4: -4, 5: -5}

Any suggestion on what should I do for this?

Done.\\

> 2) Check the documentation of 'Johnson_Boost' in case it can be used to detect negative cycles.\\
Yeah it detects negative cycle properly.

But we cant use that in our algorithm. We have to find a way to avoid this, smae problem appears here and in `radius_DHV` in #29715.\\

- 1).I have one solution,  since this methods are restricted to undirected graphs, why dont we exploit that property, since any edge with negative weight will definitely be a cycle. So raise an error in begining while checking for negative edges?

- 2). or We can try the method, I suggested in #29657.

Finally, whichever method we decide, we have to decide what do we want from our method, when `graph contains negative cycle , as well graph is disconnected`.

If I understand well, so far we have no algorithm that can be used for weighted undirected graph with at least 1 edge with negative weight. So I propose for this ticket and for #29715 to:
- raise an error if the graph has an edge with negative weight, and so to remove calls to Bellman-Ford. This way we have a correct implementation for graphs with non-negative weights.
- Indicate in the todo list of  #29657 that we have this issue. If we are able to find a proper fix, then we will be able to update all methods with this issue at once.

`@`dcoudert, I tried solving the merge conflict using following steps - 

1). Firstly, I pulled branch `public/graphs/29744_diameter_DHV` in my local branch `diameter` of develop.

2). Then, on branch `develop`, I ran `git pull` to pull changes from sage git repository.

3). Then, I checked out `diameter` branch and ran `git merge develop`, hoping to get merge conflicts. But It merged cleanly. And is running without any problem.

Is this the right procedure to find merge conflicts?

Can you suggest me something for this?
