Hi Nicolas,

please make sure to mark tickets with patches properly, i.e. prepend "[with patch, needs review]". That way the automated reports pick up this ticket.

You should also accept the ticket, so that the patch is properly credited to you in trac.

Cheers,

Michael

Merged in Sage 3.2.1.rc0.

Cheers,

Michael
