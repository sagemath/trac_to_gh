for some inputs, the discrete log can take a huge amount of time, whereas for other similar inputs it takes negligible time. Here is a first example that takes negligible time (with Sage 8.0):

```
sage: time mod(17,10^15+37).log(3)
CPU times: user 48 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 48 ms
Wall time: 53.3 ms
502952226729022
```
Now consider this other computation modulo a very near prime:

```
sage: time mod(17,10^15+56719).log(3)
CPU times: user 1min 3s, sys: 1.42 s, total: 1min 5s
Wall time: 1min 6s
420536002305675
```
If we directly call the Pari/GP discrete log function, it is much faster:

```
sage: time gp.znlog(17,mod(3,10^15+56719))
CPU times: user 16 ms, sys: 4 ms, total: 20 ms
Wall time: 130 ms
420536002305675
```
Why don't we call the Pari/GP function?

Hi,

I just looked at the source code, and it seems that this happens because 3 is not a generator of  `Integers(10^15+56719)`, sage already calls pari, but falls back to a generic implementation if the base is not a generator of the unit group. 

```
sage: time mod(17,10^15+56719).log(7)
CPU times: user 45.3 ms, sys: 786 Âµs, total: 46.1 ms
Wall time: 46.2 ms
502331130239286
```
This might stem from a time where pari could not handle this case yet. I'm writing a patch that should fix this.


Note that the running time is not really the worst thing, the memory usage of python reaches a peak of about 4GB during the execution of
`mod(17,10^15+56719).log(3)`.
