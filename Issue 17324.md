Is there a reason why you do

```
if type(entries) is not dict:
```

instead of

```
if isinstance(entries, dict):
```

?

Yes, I need to assign it `_entries` which is declared as `dict`. So the type really has to be `dict`, not some derived type.

But we should support derived types, which is not currently the case.

I see. I was thinking too much like in Java or pointers in C++. LGTM.
