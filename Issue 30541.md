This has been discussed in the past and rejected, on the grounds that the directive is hidden when people look at the reference manual or just do `x.method?`, so they may expect those tests to work all the time. For any of these proposed directives, the corresponding page in the reference manual should have a clear warning. I don't know what to do about the help string for each relevant method/function/class. It's overkill to modify the help string based on such a directive, right?

There is certainly an open question here. I don't think it's only a matter of marking up the doctests with "optional" tags. With modularization going forward, we need to find a way to inform the user that some Python module is provided by a particular distribution package. I think this information should be attached to the module name instead of cluttering the doctests.

Looks like this topic is showing up every 4-6 years.

What has changed now is that modularization (#29705) would introduce LOTS of new optional tags if we don't find a systematic solution.
