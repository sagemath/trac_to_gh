# Issue 29615: Get rid of sage-env-config

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29852

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-06-13 00:34:54

We remove 
 * the build-time dependency of the sage distribution on `src/bin/sage-env-config` 
 * the runtime dependency of sagelib on `sage-env-config`.

Instead we use `sage-config` from `sage_conf` (which has a dependency on our `python3` package, of course).

I was rather convinced that was already in. Oh yes, it has been reverted once. It should be fine now.
