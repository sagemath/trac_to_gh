CC:  fbissey mjo jhpalmieri arojas slabbe

We remove 
* the build-time dependency of the sage distribution on `src/bin/sage-env-config` 
* the runtime dependency of sagelib on `sage-env-config`.

Instead we use `sage-config` from `sage_conf` (which has a dependency on our `python3` package, of course).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29852
