# Issue 24005: Absolute import when importing string

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24242

Original creator: jdemeyer

A few modules import the Python module `string`. Since this name is so generic, it might conflict with submodules inside Sage (this happened in #24222). So it's better to use `from __future__ import absolute_import`.

I thought at some point we had agreed to just put `from __future__ import absolute_import` in every module.  It is _much better_ anyways than the old import semantics.
