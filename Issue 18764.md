# Issue 18764: Conic diagonalization fails on some base fields

The function `sage.schemes.plane_conics.con_field.ProjectiveConic_field.hom()` with codomain argument `Y` given fails on base fields for which sage doesn't know how to simplify fractions of polynomials. Consequently `diagonalization()` fails for cases that I need to implement #6881.

My current workaround is to, in case of characteristic 0, convert the fraction `q` to a symbolic expression and back. I'm not sure if this is mathematically okay, and this still leaves infinite fields of positive characteristic.

But is it really necessary for `diagonalization()` to check if the found matrix transformation gives the required morphism?

*Example:*


```python
sage: K = FractionField(PolynomialRing(QQ, 't')); (t,) = K.gens(); C = Conic(K, [1/2,0, 1, 2, 0, 3])
sage: C.diagonalization()

Replying to [comment:1 lackermans]:
Really a defect, as we shouldn't throw a ValueError for something that can't be computed.

This is a serious bug in `hom`, giving incorrect information to the user. That needs to be fixed, independently of what it means for the diagonalization method, and for all fields once and for all. I removed the workaround (which only works for certain fields) from the ticket description.

As a temporary workaround: avoid giving `Y` to `hom` in conics, and use `diagonal_matrix()` directly instead of `diagonalization()`.

You need to put your real name as reviewer.
