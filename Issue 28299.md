* pyflakes: src/sage/modular/quatalg/brandt.py:210: 'sage.misc.mrange.cartesian_product_iterator' imported but unused

* if the code after `if False and N1 != 1:` is not reachable, why not just commenting it ?

* you let some `if xxx == 0:`. Why not using `if not xxx:` ?

```diff
+                    if e and (d / e).valuation(p) == 0:
```


```diff
+                if percent_done % 5 == 0:
```
