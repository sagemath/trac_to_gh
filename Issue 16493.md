Before


```
sage: g = PermutationGroup([("a","b","c","d")])
sage: g.blocks_all()
[This is the Trac macro *1, 3* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1, 3-macro)
sage: g.blocks_all(False)
[[[1, 3], [2, 4]]]
```


After


```
sage: g = PermutationGroup([("a","b","c","d")])
sage: g.blocks_all()
[This is the Trac macro *'a', 'c'* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#'a', 'c'-macro)
sage: g.blocks_all(False)
[[['a', 'c'], ['b', 'd']]]  
```
