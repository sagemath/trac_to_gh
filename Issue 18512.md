Keywords: F4, groebner basis, ideal

We propose a new C++ library to compute Groebner basis over finite fields with the F4 algorithm.
This library works on prime fields of characteristic < 2^32 
and on binary field extensions of degree < 64.

The source code and a documentation are available on 
https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~viva/f4/html/index.html

The branch attached to this ticket contains a wrapper (Cython) for this library.
Place the f4 archive in the upstream directory, then use
sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums
sage -i -c -f f4
before using this branch.

Informations on the new package:

-Speed (on my computer without vectorisation):

cyclic 8, GF(251): 
sage : 45.7 s
f4 : 30.8 s 

katsura 12, GF(251): 
sage : 12min 36s
f4 : 3min 16s

cyclic 8, GF(65521):
sage : 58.4
f4 : 25s

katsura 12, GF(65521):
sage : 15min 47s
f4 : 2min 46s

cyclic 8, GF(4294967291) : 
sage : does not work
f4 : 55.5 s

katsura 12, GF(4294967291) : 
sage : does not work
f4 : 11min 50s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2^15):
sage : 60 s
f4 : 10s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2^31): 
sage : 58.1 s
f4 : 15s

Ideal in 8 variables over GF(2^63):  
sage : 1min 18s
f4 : 30s


Documentation:

Available with the package (doxygen).
And in the updated file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.


Usability:

Can be used in the same way than other algorithms.
However only the grevlex order is available.
Detailed in the file multi_polynomial_ideal.py, function groebner_basis.


Absence of memory leaks:

Tested with valgrind.


Maintainable:

When the Givaro version of Sage will be updated, the package could be build with this dependency in order to handle the prime fields of big characteristics.


Portability:

In order to be efficient our package can use the SSE2 and SSE4 extensions (vectorisation).
This extensions are automatically detected at build time (configure).
However, even without these optimisations our package is more efficient than the current implemented algorithms in Sage.
The package was tested on:
- Ubuntu 12.04 (64 bits)
- Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
- Debian 8 (32 bits)
- Arch Linux (64 bits)
- Mac OS X Yosemite (64 bits)


Reasonable build time, size, dependencies:

If the build time is a problem, examples can be removed from the makefile.am.
Size: 12Mo
Dependencies: Givaro is an optional dependency but a recent version is required.


Note:

The proposed wrapper in Cython is not very efficient and may be improved:
for instance, the computation of katsura 12 over GF(4294967291) takes only 2min 11s, 
and more than 9 min are spent in the cython wrapper to convert the result into sage polynomials.

This looks very interesting.

Can you clarify what you're trying to achieve with this ticket. Do you want your F4 code to be a standard or an optional package? Note that adding standard packages requires a vote on [sage-devel] and usually some time during which the package was an optional package.


Does your package have a name other than F4?

Also, do you have an idea why the performance of the wrapper is so poor?

- f4 is rather generic for a software project implementing the F4 algorithm. If possible, it would be good to rename it (I know this is rather invasive). If you agree to rename this would affect the tarball, the file in the Sage library and the name of the algorithm when calling groebner_basis(). 


- I think the pyx file should be moved to `sage.libs.<libraryname>.<libraryname>.pyx`

- I improved conversion a bit:

```python
# before
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)), 8, 'x')
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.groebner_basis_f4 import groebner_basis_f4
sage: %time gb0 = groebner_basis_f4(I)
6.4465777874 # <- conversion time
CPU times: user 14.8 s, sys: 400 ms, total: 15.2 s
Wall time: 15.2 s

# after
sage: P = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(2^31)), 8, 'x')  
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)                  
sage: %time gb0 = groebner_basis_f4(I)                
3.16141104698 # <- conversion time
CPU times: user 11.8 s, sys: 144 ms, total: 12 s
Wall time: 11.9 s
```

- I cleaned the module up a bit under u/malb/t18749_f4

The C++ code looks decent. Are you one of the upstream authors? 

I didn't see a public source repo or bug tracker. If you don't want to host it yourself there is always github or bitbucket. But just putting a tarball on your homepage hasn't been best practice since the 90s ;-)

Are the headers installed to $prefix/include/f4/include/f4.h? Why the extra /include/?

Thank you for the bug report and the wrapper improvement.

I have found the bug (due to SSE).

Does the name 
-f4lib
-openf4
may be a suitable ?

For the "extra /include":
I place in $prefix/include only libf4.h and f4.h,
the "real" sources are placed in the $prefix/include/f4 directory where the declarations are separed from the definitions.

I will set up a git soon with the fix.

Let me know if you have any other requirements.

I'd say anything which is a proper name should work. 'f4lib' doesn't really qualify by that criterion I'd say, but it's better than 'f4'; 'openf4' could do. It's really up to you, though.

Why do you install the sources at all? As far as I can see you instantiate all templates in `libf4.cpp` anyway, so is there a need to copy the whole source code in `local/include`?

It would be much better if it was under GPL version 3 *or later*. If this isn't the case, you should ask upstream if they are willing to release under GPL version 3 or later.

I update the code on https://github.com/nauotit/openf4 (the bug is fixed)

and the Sage files in the branch u/tcoladon/f4.

The new upstream name is openf4.

I don't understand your question about the licence? 

If the sources installation is a problem, we can remove them (just change the Makefile.am in the src directory) in a special target dedicated to Sage?

I haven't deleted the # lines in file groebner_basis_f4.pyx in case Givaro version is updated.

For the comparison with Magma, I'm not sure that openf4 is better on smaller prime fields. Magma is very slow when the characteristic is higher than 2^24

There is a difference between releasing between releasing a project under "**GPL version 3**" and "**GPL version 3 or any later version**". The latter is much preferred in case a GPL version 4 ever comes out and we want to be compatible with that.

I don't see any easy way to do this after quickly browsing `openf4` source code.

As far as initialization is concerned, the only constructor for polynomials on top of move and copy contructors takes a vector of strings.
You can init an empty polynomial and add terms one at a time but you have to sort the temrs first.

And to extract the result you have to do the same thing.

So my opinion is that such functions should be added to openf4, not the the sage wrapper.
They could for example eat and spit vectors of Element.

Another thing: if `openf4` is so much faster like you claim, it should be the default algorithm for Gröbner basis computations over rings which `openf4` can handle. That would also greatly increase the testing coverage.
