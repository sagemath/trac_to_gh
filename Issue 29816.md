an easy way out is just to check whether the locale change worked, and if not, use `C` locale, not `C.UTF-8`. Perhaps print a warning.

This breaks building sphinx on windows.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/838933940

Same error as #30008.

As far as I understand the problem is that we need some sort of UTF to make the sphinx build work.
It appears that on `cygwin` the default is better than `C` and `C.UTF-8` does not work.
So maybe `C` is not the best alternative for `C.UTF-8`.

Btw, strangely centos 7 appears to work with the current beta. I don't know what happened. (And I don't know yet, if this behavior is stable).

I'm not sure what you mean here.  `C.UTF-8` is supported on Cygwin and is in fact the default locale in absence of any other settings: https://www.cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-locale.html

> The default locale in the absence of the aforementioned locale environment variables is "C.UTF-8".

Ok, thanks for the information. I think the major take-away from PEP538 is,

> With this change, any *nix platform that does not offer at least one of the C.UTF-8, C.utf8 or UTF-8 locales as part of its standard configuration would only be considered a fully supported platform for CPython 3.7+ deployments when a suitable locale other than the default C locale is configured explicitly (e.g. en_AU.UTF-8, zh_CN.gb18030).

I'm pretty sure we have files that actually need the UTF-8 encoding by now, so that rules out the possibility of "doing nothing" (leaving `LC_ALL=C` or `LC_CTYPE=C`) on python-3.6. And if we want to make python-3.6 work the way that python-3.7 does, then we're in the same situation as upstream is with respect to C.UTF-8: we have to consider python-3.6 with no C.UTF-8 (or equivalent) unsupported.

So I see two real options left:

1. Try to set the locale to `C.UTF-8` or `C.utf8` or `UTF-8` when python-3.6 is being used, and declare the system unsupported if we can't. If python-3.7+ is being used, we can set the locale to `C`, and it will coerce the locale to something utf8ish on its own. In either case, a lack of utf8 locale would be unsupported.
2. Don't set a locale at all, and rely on the distribution/user to set a utf8 locale by default. This would result in some confusing grep/sort behavior (they're locale-dependent), but maybe we could be extra careful in our SPKGs to work around that, so that e.g. `en_US.UTF-8` would work too.

Long-term, as one of the largest python projects in existence, I think we probably have to suck it up and go with (1), even though it pains me to require a locale that glibc doesn't even ship and isn't POSIX. Whatever decisions python makes, we're stuck with.

To me, it seems like an error of the following kind. That is we are opening the `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` file as a `bytes` type, and at some place (where?), we decode the bytes to ascii and then we get `UnicodeDecodeError` because it is not ascii at all. Here is a way to reproduce the same error message:


```
sage: with open('src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst', 'rb') as f: b = f.read()                
sage: b.decode('ascii')                                                                              
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-498050d5a3fb> in <module>
----> 1 b.decode('ascii')

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2661: ordinal not in range(128)
sage: s = b.decode('utf-8') 
```

I am adding Frédéric in cc since he fixed a lot of those `UnicodeDecodeError` in recent times with the passage to Python 3.

Also, why this works in Python3.8 and not in Python3.6 ?

I get the same error after make doc-clean && make. In fact adding a line `print('AAAAAAAAAAAAA')` a this place does not print any `AAAAAAAAA...` on my screen, so I wonder if that code is really executed before the error occurs.

there are also many more missing `encoding='utf-8'` in `open()` on source files in the docbuilder.

and perhaps on other text files too. all these lead to these `UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte...`

Should we just abandon the idea to support random system Python 3.6, they are just broken in this way...

Yes, if we're going to throw python-3.6 under the bus in this release.

None, but AFAIK there were none before we started messing with the locale, either.

If no one is going to fix the python-3.6 problems, we should just drop it from the list of supported system pythons and revert this to `LC_ALL=C`. That's simpler and leaves us with one fewer locale problem to debug in the future.

there is no harm in adding this, anyway, thus, over to bots.

The stuff on ticket #30576 isn't what I was referring to...

The harm is that now we have additional locale problems to debug for a change that doesn't solve anything. With python-3.7, there are now three different configurations:

* The `C.UTF-8` locale exists and is used.
* No utf8 locale exists, so `C` is used.
* A utf8 locale is available, but your grep doesn't find it, so we wind up with `C` on a machine that could have a utf8 locale.

Why, when `LC_ALL=C` unconditionally works fine and had been in there for ages?

*If* someone wants to fix python-3.6, we should add these hacks only for python-3.6, and we should try the alternate names `C.utf8` and `UTF-8`, too.
