# Issue 12451: PIL package doesn't know about debian multiarch

Issue created by migration from Trac.

I found that the PIL spkg has patches to deal with lib vs lib64 ; unfortunately, debian-based distributions have (or will soon have) another way to handle having various types of libraries on the same system.

I'm going to propose a patch which will add support for multiarch, based on the patch which is already used in debian for the python-imaging version 1.17. It is a very clean patch, as it only triggers on debian-based systems which have already made the switch.

The patch looks ok but do you also have an updated spkg?

Why is this patch needed?  I don't have any problems building `PIL` on multi-arch systems.

I had a compilation issue while compiling the spkg in experimental settings ; as debian already packages this, I don't care anymore about the spkg being solid ; please close (why can't I close a ticket I opened?)
