Hmm...I'm guessing the problem comes from the implementation of `__cmp__` (or `__richcmp__`) in `Element`? Fundamentally we don't have to remove `__cmp__` as the rich comparisons are implemented for `CombinatorialObject` (and are compatible). Although this does expose that the rich comparisons are not really tested in the subclasses...

I was trying to fix one of the doctest failures in the last patchbot run on #22297.

Travis, do you think #22642 will fix the remaining failure here ?

Sorry, completely forgot about this. From the patchbot, it looks like it did.
