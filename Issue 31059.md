            sage_local = Path(SAGE_LOCAL)
```

to a central place (I would say sage.env but you probably don't like this) for easier reuse in similar situations.


```
PATH = ':'.join(str(p) for p in [sage_venv / 'bin', sage_local / 'bin'])

When there is no `SAGE_LOCAL`, it is the responsibility of the user to set up `PATH`; for example, by activating the venv. Doing nothing is the most standard way.

When there is a `SAGE_LOCAL`, we need to search in it; but SAGE_VENV needs to take precedence over it for consistency with what the `sage-env` script sets up.

Kind of makes sense. But why not try to search in SAGE_VENV even if SAGE_LOCAL is unset?

Your explanation also makes sense, but I don't understand why this translates to the SAGE_VENV != SAGE_LOCAL check in the code.

So the plan of this is to deprecate absolute_path, then when everyone uses absolute_filename, change absolute_path to return path and then deprecate absolute_filename? Doesn't this procedure take very long? Moreover, there is no way in the meantime to have a method that returns a path.
