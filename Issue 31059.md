Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Please extract

```
            sage_venv = Path(SAGE_VENV)
            sage_local = Path(SAGE_LOCAL)
```

to a central place (I would say sage.env but you probably don't like this) for easier reuse in similar situations.


```
PATH = ':'.join(str(p) for p in [sage_venv / 'bin', sage_local / 'bin'])
```

this is a normal variable and thus should be lowercase.

I've instead rewritten it in a simpler way. Using pathlib was not really useful there.

In my opinion, using `os.path.join` feels more complicated.


```
if SAGE_LOCAL:
+            if Path(SAGE_VENV).resolve() != Path(SAGE_LOCAL).resolve():
+                # As sage.env currently gives SAGE_LOCAL a fallback value from SAGE_VENV,
+                # SAGE_LOCAL is never unset.  So we only use it if it differs from SAGE_VENV.
```

Why are these if checks necessary? Can we not always try to first look for the executable in venv and local, and only if its not found there fall-back to PATH?

When there is no `SAGE_LOCAL`, it is the responsibility of the user to set up `PATH`; for example, by activating the venv. Doing nothing is the most standard way.

When there is a `SAGE_LOCAL`, we need to search in it; but SAGE_VENV needs to take precedence over it for consistency with what the `sage-env` script sets up.

Kind of makes sense. But why not try to search in SAGE_VENV even if SAGE_LOCAL is unset?

Your explanation also makes sense, but I don't understand why this translates to the SAGE_VENV != SAGE_LOCAL check in the code.

> sage.features.FileFeature: Replace method absolute_path by absolute_filename, with deprecation

So the plan of this is to deprecate absolute_path, then when everyone uses absolute_filename, change absolute_path to return path and then deprecate absolute_filename? Doesn't this procedure take very long? Moreover, there is no way in the meantime to have a method that returns a path.

What about adding an optional `as_path = false` argument (with deprecation if its false). If `as_path == true` then return a `Path` otherwise a str. One still has to go through two deprecation periods, but at least there is a relatively straightforward way to get the path as a `Path`.

Yes, a year, what's the rush?

Writing that is no easier than wrapping `Path(...)` around the result -- and the result is not type-stable

I presume the latte doctest patch #33467#comment:4
should come here.
