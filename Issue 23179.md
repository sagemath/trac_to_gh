Keywords: MathExp2018, days94, thursdaysbdx

With jupyter as the default notebook, we need to easily transform an `.ipynb` notebook back into some source code. This ticket adds a `sage -ipynb2rst` command.

A custom template is created to write code blocks as:

```
   sage: # blah
   ....: # blah
```

and to make mathematics formulas the default role (hence avoiding the clumsy `:math:` notation everywhere). A postprocess script fixes some issues.

Note that reviewers have to run `./configure` before `make` to let this ticket work in order to copy `rst_sage.tpl` and `postprocess.py` into the `local/share/sage/ext/nbconvert/` directory.

Why



```
        sage: L = ["sage", "--ipynb2rst", input, output]
        sage: try:
        ....:     _ = test_executable(['pandoc', '--version'])
        ....: except OSError:
        ....:     print('True')
        ....: else:
        ....:     _ = test_executable(L)
        ....:     print(open(output, 'r').read() == t)
        True
```

instead of

```
sage: L = ["sage", "--ipynb2rst", input, output]
sage: _ = test_executable(L)                     # optional: pandoc
sage: print(open(output, 'r').read() == t)       # optional: pandoc
True
```
