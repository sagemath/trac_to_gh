# Issue 24353: bug in inverse_image of module homomorphism

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24590

Original creator: sbrandhorst

Original creation time: 2018-01-24 13:25:28


```
sage: A = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,1,matrix([2]))
sage: f = A.Hom(A).an_element()
sage: f.inverse_image(A)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
....
TypeError: ambient vector spaces must be equal

```


The source of the bug is that `free_modules` are different from `free_quadratic_modules`.
Thus matrix methods like `row_span` return `free_modules` but not free_quadratic_modules`.
