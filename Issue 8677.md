In a recent thread: http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/97f1e17019caf2d0# it was reported, that  " sage 4.3.5 won't build on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4: File exists: '/usr/local_machine/sage-4.3.5/local//lib/python/site-packages//sage/structure' " The partial log output was:

My suspicion is, that the reason is some race condition in checking, whether during the build some directory has to be newly added, or already exists.

That is consistent with the fact that I have previously built Sage successfully: this was exactly the same version of Sage, on exactly the same hardware.Â  The only difference between the two situations was that before the unsuccessful build I did 'export MAKE="make -j6"' to make the build process use 6 jobs in parallel, whereas the successful build used only one build job.

Yep, this is a race condition. I hit exactly this problem for the "second" half of the parallel build stuff -- namely dispatching calls to gcc in parallel. The fix there would work here: at some point before the parallel dispatch, I walked the tree and made sure to create all the necessary directories. The other option would be to catch and ignore the `OSError`, but I think that's a horrible idea. Well, that's not completely true -- if you checked the error message, and confirmed that the filename it complained about was a directory that does now exist, it would probably be fine to ignore it and move on.

There's nothing RH specific about this -- I think it was just bad luck.

I setup NFS on disk.math and sage.math, and when I export an NSF share using the async option two things happen: 

    (1) the filesystem is noticeably *much* faster,

    (2) I can repeatedly get the error that is being discussed here with, e.g., MAKE="make -j8" on sage.math. 

Probably the RedHat system Tom Coates was using has a similar NFS setup.

With `async` set, do we need to worry more than usual about data corruption?  According to [this Linux NFS FAQ](http://nfs.sourceforge.net/#faq_b6), `async` is potentially unsafe.

Should we do as Craig suggests above, e.g., `pass` in the `except` block if `dirname` now exists, but `raise` otherwise?


---

Comment by vbraun created at 2010-10-02 09:48:22

A correctly working NFSv3 shouldn't need the `async` options to achieve fast writes, but maybe some older servers/clients are being used? With `async`, data will be corrupted if the server crashes, but thats probably acceptable on a build system.

I take issue with the patch, however. The current race seems to be 

```
    if not os.path.exists(path): 
        # another process can create path here
        os.makedirs(path) 
        # error!
```

The correct fix would be to replace the whole if clause with 

```
    try: 
        os.makedirs(path) 
    except OSError: 
        pass 
```

But the patch mixes up both. It still contains the original race and then hacks around it to trap the error.

Are you just making this up, or?!

> The correct fix would be to replace the whole if clause with ...

I strongly disagree.  I see no point in not including the

```
if not os.path.exists(dirname):
```

code, since that makes perfect sense when doing a serial build, which is what most people do.

Thats what the aforementioned FAQ says:

```
For the Linux implementation of NFS Version 3, using the "async" export option to allow faster writes is no longer necessary. NFS Version 3 explicitly allows a server to reply before writing data to disk, under controlled circumstances.
```

The point is that the pattern "if (look at filesystem) then (modify filesystem)" is fundamentally flawed. Its the origin of countless security problems from temp races etc. The world is a better place without it :-) And the only way to make it die is to stomp it out wherever we encounter it...

What if we use William's solution for the first "hunk" and Volker's for the second?  Then we can avoid many unnecessary exceptions in the first.  In the second, we only call `os.makedirs` if copying the Cython-compiled file fails.

Alternate version, fix commit string.  Apply just one patch.

I've add a patch that does this.

Sorry, maybe I did not understand the issue. Is this about improving performance? Is that microsecond really going to matter in a loop where we copy files and/or call the compiler?

In any case, I think mixing the two patterns is taking the worst of both worlds ;-) I'll attach my version of the patch in case I wasn't clear enough.

With a clean, built-from-scratch 4.6.alpha3 on sage.math, I applied v3, did `rm -rf devel/sage/build/` and then `env MAKE="make -j20" ./sage -ba-force`.  The latter fails after a number of 
`python `which cython`` commands:

```python
[...]

This doesn't happen with v1 or v2, but I'm not sure why.  Thoughts?

Probably on lines 687-690, "path" should be "dirname"?  I'm attaching a new version with this change.  Since all of the other patches list William as the author, I'm doing the same for this one...

Just for the record:

Though I've seen this not very often (I think the first time with 4.6.alpha2), I can confirm that running into the race condition wasn't limited to NFS-mounted file systems...
