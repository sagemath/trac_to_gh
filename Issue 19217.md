If a finite state machine is determined by a transition function, the output alphabet usually turns out to be `None`, which contrasts the default behaviour for other construction methods.


```
sage: def transition_function(state, letter):
....:     return (0, 3 + letter)
sage: T1 = Transducer(transition_function,
....:     input_alphabet=[0, 1],
....:     initial_states=[0],
....:     final_states=[0])
sage: T1.output_alphabet is None
True
sage: T2 = Transducer([(0, 0, 0, 3), (0, 0, 0, 4)],
....:     initial_states=[0],
....:     final_states=[0])
sage: T2.output_alphabet
[3, 4]
```

For some reason, trac was faster than `git trac push`. But everything is fine.
