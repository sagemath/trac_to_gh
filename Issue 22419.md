Keywords: quantum bruhat graph

As part of the quantum Bruhat graph construction, we create the minimal length coset representatives when multiplying by a root. So we do not want to iterate over the entire Weyl group as the quantum Bruhat graph is connected.

This has the effect of cutting the construction time in half.
