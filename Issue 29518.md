Multiprocessing, as implemented in differential geometry computations via

```
sage: Parallelism().set(nproc=8)
```

does not work under macOS. This has been reported by many users, a recent report being https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/0RsGgb3lmZg/zNTMFLH9AQAJ

Note there is no issue within the doctest framework, i.e. the doctests involving parallel computations implemented in `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable` and `src/sage/tensor/modules` are passed on macOS machines.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29755

it is not clear how to see that it is broken. Could you point at a doctest that doesn't work at the Sage prompt?

For instance, the doctest about the [parallelization of the Lie derivative](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/manifolds/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield_paral.html#sage.manifolds.differentiable.tensorfield_paral.TensorFieldParal.lie_derivative), a short version of which is

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: v = M.vector_field(-y, x)
sage: w = M.one_form(y^2*sin(x), x^3*cos(y))
sage: Parallelism().set(nproc=2)
sage: w.lie_derivative(v).display()
(-y^3*cos(x) + x^3*cos(y) + 2*x*y*sin(x)) dx 
 + (-x^4*sin(y) - 3*x^2*y*cos(y) - y^2*sin(x)) dy
```
