There is a serious bug in the implementation of `cellular_involution` for a tensor product of cellular algebras that is also expressed as the cellular basis.

There is currently no implementation that this case would cover, but it is conceivable that it might occur. However, because of this, it is not something I can easily add a doctest for.

Ah, crap. I forgot to change that back to `x`. I will correct this tomorrow when I get to my office.
