There are a number of doctests also impacted by this.  I've fixed a few of them in my Python 3 branch.  This probably fixed several more :)

One change here causes the PDF documentation to fail â€“ see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/H5pcrftzR8c/EkfTA486BwAJ. I've opened up `@`25656 to fix it.
