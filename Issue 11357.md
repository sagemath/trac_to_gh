These are (rooted) trees modulo permutation of children, right? I'm asking because I don't see much of a documentation here.

From looking at the code and the `normalize()` doctest, that is right (i.e., they are not ordered/planer trees). I think we need to expand the documentation before this can get into Sage.

Hello,

concerning the ranker, I do not care about the possible non-deterministic aspect. There is no clear canonical way to generate and number all rooted trees, so there is no best choice.

concerning the methods of `LabelledRootedTrees`, well, there is no `LabelledRootedTrees_all`. And I do not think one need that for now.

At some point later, it would be good to have classes for labelled rooted trees with labels in a fixed set. So far, all possible labels are allowed. This is needed for operads.

It is true that the content of this ticket is rather minimalistic. But it is enough for #15635, which is my main motivation.

ok, I have got rid of ranker, so that the order is now deterministic.

Maybe it will be slow, but speed can be taken care later on.

I have tried to use cached_method for the sort_key function, but it does not interact well with the ClonableTree setup.

The patchbot should be happy, let us see.

No problem, let us keep the 'dendrographical' stuff. The name sounds somewhat funny to me.

I am not sure I see the point on warning about issues that look not very likely to be met  in the near future. But if you want to add them, I will not resist.

The easier test to make sure the hash is working is to do something like `hash(x) == hash(x)` (unless of course you're expecting a specific value, like `hash(1) == 1`), and it doesn't cause trivial doctest failures for changes to the hash function, but it probably doesn't really matter here.

Florent which is coming back to Sage after a long absence. 

By the way : Tanks to all of you for finishing this one !

Hello Florent. Glad to see you back.

To finish this ticket, I had to get rid of the dependency to #10194.
If I could suggest something, that would be to take care of #10194. It would certainly
help several people, that have based many of their tickets on that one.
