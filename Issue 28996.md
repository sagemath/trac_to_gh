# Issue 28996: bootstrap && make distclean broken

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29233

* #26964 now creates documentation files during bootstrap
* make distclean blows away these generated files
* subsequent make fails when building documentation

Fundamentally, I think bootstrap is just not the right place to generate documentation. You should just bootstrap the absolute minimum to run the actual build. Bootstrap is not a dump for miscellaneous build steps. The more you do the more likely you are to run into conflicts with other make targets.

`make distclean` should remove `./configure`

Volker, are you sure you regenerated the configure tar ball?

Our `distclean` doesn't remove `./configure`, neither should it ihmo. Distclean should remove whatever configure output there is, but it should keep the actual configure script which would go into a proper tarball.

well, then it's a bug that `make distclean` removes stuff not made by `make all` or by `./configure`


---

Correct. And to fix it we can either kludge around with `make distclean` to not delete what should be build artifacts, or move building the documentation from `bootstrap` to `make doc`.

it's not just documentation. One possible way to use these is to generate help info **before** the build, something like: "you're on Debian, to make use of as many
Debian external packages as possible do `apt-get install ...`"

also, it's used for CI. You need to tell your CI host what to install to minimise build time, and this is OS-specific and pre-build.

OK, deletion should be done by `bootstrap-clean`, not `misc-clean`. My bad.

However, note that bootstrap is the correct build phase for making these files. This build phase, after all,  prepares `src` for `sdist`, the distribution for dist and for configure.
