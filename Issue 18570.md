# Issue 18570: Provide .monomial() method for multi-variate polynomial rings

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: klee

Keywords: monomial

Some people, including me, find it not immediate to think of a syntax to construct a monomial in multi-variate polynomial rings. Currently the suggested syntax is

`P.({(1,2,3):1})`

to construct the monomial `x*y<sup>2*z</sup>3`. This ticket provides much intuitive `.monomial()` method. It can be used like

`P.monomial(1,2,3)`

Hello,

Please try to avoid trailing whitespaces (that are whitespaces before line break). There are three of them in your examples.

Instead of `self.one()` it would be better to use `self.base_ring().one()` as the value of the dictionary is intended to be the value of the coefficients (i.e. an element of the base ring).

Could you add something like the following in your examples

```
sage: m = R.monomial(1,2,3)
sage: R.monomial(*m.degrees()) == m
True
```

It would show the syntax for rebuilding a monomial from a tuple.

Vincent

The patchbot reports an error (click on the yellow bulb. yellow means bad in general).
