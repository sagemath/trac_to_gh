CC:  @nthiery @hivert @fchapoton

Some Sage modules look like

```
__doc__ = r"""
docstring here...
"""
```


I see no reason at all to have this instead of a normal docstring.

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for catching this. I remember trying out several things before converging to this solution, but can't recall why I had used and explicit `__doc__` assignment. I may have just confused myself at some point. If everything works without the explicit assignment, and I don't see why not, that's certainly much better. I have double checked for introspection and doc building. So positive review!
