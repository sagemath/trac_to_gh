# Issue 20396: Get rid of "__doc__ =" instead of docstring

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20633

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2016-05-19 15:50:42

Some Sage modules look like

```
__doc__ = r"""
docstring here...
"""
```


I see no reason at all to have this instead of a normal docstring.

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for catching this. I remember trying out several things before converging to this solution, but can't recall why I had used and explicit `__doc__` assignment. I may have just confused myself at some point. If everything works without the explicit assignment, and I don't see why not, that's certainly much better. I have double checked for introspection and doc building. So positive review!

Thanks!

It could be that something did not work with some earlier version...
