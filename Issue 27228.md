# Issue 27228: py3: libs/ppl.pyx fixes

In the output from the `test_executable` function, it seems that Python 3 prints deprecation warnings after other output, whereas Python 2 prints it before other output. The branch here just adds `py3` versions of the deprecation doctests in `libs/ppl.pyx`.

Not a very pretty fix, but I think it works.

I tried adding `fflush(stderr)` in the various `ascii_dump` functions, which I was hoping would unify the Python 2/3 output, but it didn't make any difference.

Frédéric, any thoughts on this?

The change LGTM (assuming green patchbot).
