```diff
-import zlib; comp = zlib
-import bz2; comp_other = bz2
+import zlib
+import bz2
+comp = zlib
+comp_other = bz2
```

I haven't looked at the surrounding code, but is there a reason not to simply `import ... as ...`?


```diff
         if names and self.Vrep():
-            return tuple(self.Vrep()[i]  for i in range(self.n_Vrepresentation()) if not i in self.far_face_tuple())
+            return tuple(self.Vrep()[i] for i in range(self.n_Vrepresentation()) if i not in self.far_face_tuple())
         else:
-            return tuple(smallInteger(i) for i in range(self.n_Vrepresentation()) if not i in self.far_face_tuple())
+            return tuple(smallInteger(i) for i in range(self.n_Vrepresentation()) if i not in self.far_face_tuple())
```

Not sure about this one: The formatting was clearly intended to make the `for ...` parts start in the same column. I'm fine with it either way, but it may be something to reconsider.
