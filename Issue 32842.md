`standard` builds (= with enough system packages) do accept system `python3`, as tested on GH Actions. So this ticket is not critical for Sage 9.5

Fails here. Something may be wrong with my Cygwin.

Before getting Python 3.9 there, Sage would build
using system Python 3.8.12.

It now deems system Python 3.9 unusable, and build
its own Python lacking an ssl module.

Neither #33055 (fix build of python3 spkg on Conda)
nor #33066 (openssl 3.0.1) help.
