Keywords: upgrade, gsl

Sage uses the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), or GSL.

Currently [SageMath](SageMath) ships GSL 2.3.

Considering that GSL 2.4 was released in June 2017, it would be nice to upgrade.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25261
