Sage uses the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), or GSL.

Currently [SageMath](SageMath) ships GSL 2.3.

Considering that GSL 2.4 was released in June 2017, it would be nice to upgrade.

Have been using 2.4 in sage-on-gentoo since September. The upgrade should be trivial.

It seems like I have been running this version in sage-on-gentoo for at least 10 days without noticing. So I'll positive review that.
