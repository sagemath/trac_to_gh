```
sage: m=540579833922455191419978421211010409605356811833049025*sqrt(1/2)
sage: m1=382247666339265723780973363167714496025733124557617743
sage: bool(m==m1)
True
```

Like #18883 is another case of falling through in `Expression.__nonzero__` to calling Maxima which fails, in this case because of its hardcoded 53 bits precision.

This draft triggers three doctests:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/calculus/calculus.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/calculus/wester.py  # 1 doctest failed
```
