# Issue 19093: Implement conversion of interval fields to real/complex fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19330

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-10-01 19:29:59

It surprises me that this isn't implemented yet:

```
sage: RR(RIF("1.2"))
TypeError: Unable to convert x (='1.200000000000000?') to real number.
```
