In sage/libs/ratpoints there is a cython interface to the standard ratpoints package (Michael Stoll's efficient C library for point searching on curves of the form `y^2=f(x)` for polynomials `f(x)` of any degree).

The interface currently only allows the user to specify the coefficients of the polynomial, a height bound, and a maximum number of points to be found.  But ratpoints has other parameters, in particular upper and lower bounds for the denominator of `x` (useful in searching for integralpoints) and the ability to search only for `x` in one or more real intervals.

We propose to enhance the interface to allow non-defaults for all the ratpoints parameters, while remaining completely backwards compatible.

Volker, you set that commit field manually!  The hash of the commit I actually pushed is
8527d9fecac247012d1bf4dd843edffff90344e3

If you cannot see that it must not have pushed properly, I am pushing it again now using git directly and not sage -dev.  But it failed:

```
jec@atkin:~/sage (branch: trac15554-ratpoints)$ git push trac u/cremona/ticket/15554
X11 forwarding request failed on channel 0

Thanks, I had forgotten that syntax.  I think it has now pushed ok, but as usual the push command takes  a very long time and has not given me back a prompt yet.

This is "known" (at least to Volker and me -- I forget which sage-devel/sage-git topic Volker mentioned having this problem), and if it hangs, you can just `ctrl-C`. By that point it usually has already pushed.

I will make some review changes in a minute.
