CC:  jpflori

Keywords: BLAS

OpenBLAS should replace ATLAS as it is 
* (much) faster to install
* faster to run

This replacement is mentionned in #17635 (upgrade fflas-ffpack) and is related to #19719 (upgrade ATLAS), and #17630 (clean up the BLAS).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20096

Hardcoding one blas over another blas ist imho the wrong way. It should be configurable, see #17075.

Sure. I should have been clearer: the idea is to
- change the default BLAS installed by [SageMath](SageMath) from ATLAS to OpenBLAS
- let the user the option to specify which BLAS to link against.
- simplify the current BLAS, BLAS2 variable mess

Adding

```
from __future__ import print_function
```

turns `print` into a real function.
With your code it calls the magic `print` on `("...")` which turns out to have the same behavior in this specific case.

Nope, please don't do so.

Isn't there a previous issue with the static archive in the log?

This is a bug.  Sage meanwhile *requires* a system Python (>= 2.6) to build / bootstrap anyway.

And while ATLAS' `spkg-install` in some files at least claims to aim at compatibility to Python 2.4(!), I have some patches to make it work with Python 2.6 (in order to drop the dependency on *Sage's* Python, such that it is built **early**, almost first)...
