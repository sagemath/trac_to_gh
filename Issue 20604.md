In #20718, we changed an example in a docstring, but there were examples following it which should have been changed as well. So let's change those.

In #20718, the second line viewable in the diff was changed:

```
(0, 2) - (0, 5) + (2, 5)
```

It used to say `(0, 3) - (0, 6) + (3, 6)`, so the following text referred to it. Now it makes sense to change the following text to refer to `(0, 2) - ...` instead.
