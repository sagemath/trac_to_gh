Currently there is no way to implement coercions using categories because of the default implementation of `Parent._coerce_map_from_`. However, naturally calling successive `super._coerce_map_from_` is feasible, but there are technical limitations with doing this in Python 2. Another approach would be to implement a coercion hook in the relevant `ConstructionFunctor`, which would better reflect the mathematics.

Branch with previous work from Nicolas on #18700. It will probably have a merge conflict with #18700, but I did that so my revert commit will not get applied.
