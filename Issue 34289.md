https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github does not seem to do a good conversion of this complex table.

Instead I saved the page as HTML and used `pandoc -f html -t rst --wrap=none` on the result

I've now manually converted it to a `list-table`. https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tables.html#list-table-directive

I don't think this content has a place in the developer manual.

Why don't you move it to github sage wiki?

I think it very much belongs in the developer manual. It makes an important point: Contributing to Sage does not necessarily mean to contribute to the Sage library. I want to broaden the developer's guide so that it captures a broader profile of developers and contributions.

We haven't made a decision yet to use the GitHub wiki.

Moreover, I think it is not a good replacement for material that we now have on our wikis: GitHub wikis are not indexed by search engines.

Then change the title of ticket and do more work. Only adding "mathematical software landscape" at the introduction of the developer manual seems unbalanced to me.

Perhaps you don't really want to do the work as we did not move to github yet. Then set it "needs work" now?

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

Yes, this makes sense.

Then this is an argument to keep using trac at least for wikis :)

Perhaps we will be forced to use github wiki after the migration...

Or we go back to sagemath wiki?

No, that's not suitable. Nobody can edit it - except for people with legacy Trac accounts

I think it is a possibility that we keep using the Trac wiki for a while, yes. The conversion script does tickets and wiki separately. In fact, I just sent a PR https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/pull/4 that makes it easier

(What I don't know is whether Trac can be configured to be read-only for tickets, but read-write for wiki.)

The final comment here

https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/4992#discussioncomment-1448177

seems to say this is not true for some popular wikis.

why don't we migrate wiki to GH, too?

This appears to be about questionable Google's practice. Somebody there comments
about being unable to find anything on [GitHub](GitHub) using https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22
Indeed, it doesn't show anything on [GitHub](GitHub) on the 1st page.
However, https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22
does show [GitHub](GitHub) stuff!

That is, Google does index [GitHub](GitHub), it just doesn't want to show it, unless asked pointedly.

And https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lunar+lander+game%22+%22github%22+%22wiki%22 does show some wikis there, too

I'm saying it does not necessarily have to be done at the same time. Easier, no?

Specifically, GitHub wikis, not GitHub as a whole obviously!

And it seems that it's just that GitHub is just using robots.txt on the wikis. I haven't checked.
