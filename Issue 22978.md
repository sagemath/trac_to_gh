In #22523 we added the symbolic power of a matrix. If possible the matrix is transformed to QQbar to handle more cases. 

When this is not possible, we try/catch the `TypeError` exception, for example with `matrix([[pi, e],[0, -2*I]]).change_ring(QQbar)`. This ticket covers another type of exception, `NotImplementedError`, that happens for example with `matrix(2, [a, b, -b, a]).change_ring(QQbar)`.
