Have tried further improvements like using C arrays instead of lists when appropriate or any other improvements that could provide a substantial speed up ?

A minor comment:
- `list(iter(C.values()))` -> `list(C.values())`

a minor improvement

```diff
-     for i in range(nV):
-         v = V[i]
+     for i, v in enumerate(V):
         Vd[v] = i
```

For me this patch is good to go.

Further improvements can certainly be done, but in another ticket.
