Replying to [ticket:12787 jdemeyer]:

I already cleaned up `SPKG.txt`, `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` at #9906; this just complicates rebasing, again, as you also made some of the changes I made there, but not all of them.

FWIW, #9906, which really wasn't that hard to review, as I intentionally did _not_ upgrade R or RPy there, rottens anyway...

It shouldn't be that much work to rebase, `spkg-install` and `spkg-check` aren't that big...

Changing status from new to needs_review.

Anyway, this spkg does fix the problem I was having, so needs review.

Diff for the R spkg, for review only

Looks good. 

I guess #9906 won't be finished in time for sage-5.0, so lets go with this.

Actually, this isn't meant for sage-5.0.

Too bad upstream is _totally_ ignoring this...

Grandupstream (`autoconf`) is completely ignoring my bug request and patch.
