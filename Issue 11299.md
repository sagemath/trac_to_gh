This is a port of the code at #9428 to the Flask notebook.  The code should be a bit cleaner (not having to pass around username everywhere).  This should apply on top of http://code.google.com/r/rkirov-flask/ (changeset 503:79b88d03adf0).

hmmm, i am getting
"ImportError: No module named i18n"
after installing babel and flask-babel.

Is this a python package or a missing file?

It's a import that shouldn't be there.
