# Issue 18845: Elementary and special functions for real balls

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19082

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2015-08-25 07:41:53

Keywords: arb

Wrap the elementary and special functions on complex balls provided by arb. (We typically wrap only the high-level versions with automatic algorithm choice, and provide no Python access to implementations variants.)

In hypergeometric(), you could check if one of the upper parameters (typo: "paramaters") is equal to 1, and remove it. I guess you could also wrap hypgeom_m for 1F1 in this function. On the other hand, maybe it's best to wait until I put a function for pFq in Arb that takes care of all such special cases...

If you upgrade to Arb 2.7.0, you can add Bessel Y, Bessel I, polygamma, barnes_g, log_barnes_g, and some more hyperbolic functions of complex arguments.

Note that the branch appears to merge cleanly despite the red link, and to pass the testsuite despite the patchbot's report.

I get the same doctest errors as the patchbot under 6.10.beta7, perhaps the upgrade to arb 2.7 induced the problem. (No problems under 6.10.beta4 where this patch is based).

Do the tests really pass for you when merging with 6.10.beta7?

I think that's what I did, but I'll check.

Mmmhh, actually what happens is that when I run

```
$ sage -t src/sage/rings/complex_arb.pyx
```

the tests pass, but if I test the whole `rings/` directory they fail.

I don't know what the problem was, but it no longer seems to occur with 7.0Î²3.

it has to be rebased over 7.0, and I also don't see any explanation of what CBF is in the docs.

Note that CBF occurs earlier on in the doc, and it's not mentioned that it's the same thing as `ComplexBallField`. It would be good to mention in the top part of the doc, I think.

Comment by dimpase created at 2016-01-23 23:36:09

you might just use `public/19082` branch where I merged 7.0 into your branch, but docs I ask for are still for you to write.

Thanks for your comments!

What do you mean? Unless I made a mistake while checking, the branch merges without conflict into 7.0.

Yes, that's similar to the situation with `RR`, `CC`, `RIF`... that aren't documented in the corresponding modules either. So I'm not convinced that this ticket is the right place to make the change. But I added a commit with a bit of documentation about `CBF`; please tell me if that's what you had in mind.

I meant that I checked it out, instead of merging it into 7.0, and had to wait for 10 minutes for the re-builds to finish :-)

That's exactly what I meant, thanks!
