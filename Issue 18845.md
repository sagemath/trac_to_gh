What do you mean? Unless I made a mistake while checking, the branch merges without conflict into 7.0.

Yes, that's similar to the situation with `RR`, `CC`, `RIF`... that aren't documented in the corresponding modules either. So I'm not convinced that this ticket is the right place to make the change. But I added a commit with a bit of documentation about `CBF`; please tell me if that's what you had in mind.

I meant that I checked it out, instead of merging it into 7.0, and had to wait for 10 minutes for the re-builds to finish :-)
