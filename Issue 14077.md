# Issue 14077: sage -advanced doesn't document the -sagenb option

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: leif

I was trying to understand how doctesting work, and found "make ptestlong" was calling sage with a "--sagenb" option I didn't know -- and which neither "sage -h" nor "sage -advanced" knew.

I think the documentation for this switch should be added to the "sage -advanced" output.

I'd propose a patch, but I'm still trying to know what it does exactly...

What version of sage are you on? `-sagenb` or `--sagenb` is not a valid command line argument to sage. Tested on `sage-5.7` and `sage-5.8beta4`. It might be an internal argument that is not exposed to the user and not supposed to be exposed either.

I'm on sage-5.7 and this argument is used by the ptestlong target of the toplevel Makefile, as mentioned in my description.

Ok. It is a suboption of `-t` and it should not be invoked by itself.

Ok. I will wait for sage-5.9beta0. The changes in 12415 are extensive.

For rebasing this ticket, you really only need the `SAGE_ROOT` patch.

Apply to SAGE_ROOT
