Upon deleting a published worksheet, it should be removed from the published list automatically.

Or even better, to implement a publish/unpublish button for batch 
publishing just like the one for deletion.

I can't figure out how to unpublish a deleted worksheet even after the trash has been emptied!  See https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/issues/226

The SageNB notebook server has been retired for a while now.

Ok to close.
