I get at least these failures:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t ../../rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial_ring.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t ../../rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

However it does fix the problem at hand.

It's been broken for a while now I think...Anyways, thanks for figuring out such a fix so quickly.
