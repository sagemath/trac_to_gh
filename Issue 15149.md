Keywords: maxima limit

From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/dwR4kuBmiQo :

```
n = var('n')
assume(n>0)
series = -(3*n^2 + 1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
limit(series, n=infinity)
38/25*pi^2*und
```

...when the limit is clearly zero.

The problem seems related to the `n^2` in the numerator:


```
sage: series = -(1)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
0
sage: series = (n^2)*(-1)^n/sqrt(n^5 + 8*n^3 + 8)
sage: limit(series, n=infinity)
-38/75*pi^2*und
```


This seems to be an upstream problem with Maxima (see the sage-support thread).

That's all we [the reviewers] need to know (and we can also do `git diff <base_branch>` too).

LGTM.

What I meant by "basing a commit on another ticket" is what is described in the section "Branching out" on the page you linked to.  When you create a branch, it will be based on the current branch, unless you specify an alternative base (with `git branch NAME BASE` or `git checkout -b NAME BASE`, where `NAME` is the name of the new branch and `BASE` the existing branch on which the new one should be based).
