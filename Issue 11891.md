I'd really like to figure out what's going wrong with Robert's patchbot: there are 6 or 7 files where the doctesting gets killed, but I don't think there's actually a real problem.  It's especially annoying here that one of them is ell_rational_field.py.

But the patch looks good.  Assuming doctests actually pass, it gets a positive review from me.

Thanks for the review.  Doctests pass, no problem.

Fails on 32-bit (my mistake, I should have tested this):
