Should be rebased, it doesn't apply to any version of Sage I tried.

Hey Jeroen,

Try this version. I can't see why Darij's patch doesn't apply...

For patchbot:

Apply: trac_14757-acyclic_layout-ts.patch

Here is my queue on sage-5.10rc1:


```
darij`@`travis-virtualbox:~/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sage-main$ hg qapplied
trac_8392-check_permutation-ts.patch
trac_14724-tableau_to_permutation_and_friend-cs.patch
trac_7983-major_index-dg.patch
trac_14748_deprecationwarning.patch
trac_14136-p_partition_enumerator_folded.patch
trac_14757-acyclic_layout-dg.patch
```


I don't see which of these should conflict with the patch...

[attachment:trac_14757-acyclic_layout-ts.patch] works for me, I cannot explain why...

I think I know what caused the patch to fail. I had a weird wifi issue where my Windows host system would connect to the internet, while the Linux in the virtual machine wouldn't. So I took the patch from Linux and copypasted it into a text editor in Windows, from where I uploaded it. So it ended up in DOS format. Oops.
