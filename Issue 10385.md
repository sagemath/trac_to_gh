# Issue 10385: Calculate the character of a newform

Newforms of level Gamma1(N), or GammaH(N) (after 8716), are always eigenforms for the diamond operators (i.e. they have a character) but we don't at present have any way of calculating it.

Just realised this is coded in a rather stupid way (generic Hecke modules don't have a diamond_bracket_operator method, and hence shouldn't have a diamond_eigenvalue method either). I will fix this in conjunction with work on #10451.

I propose to close this ticket as "duplicate", since the functionality I proposed to add is included in #10451.

I'm setting this to "positive review" as an invitation to the release manager to close it, because all the functionality I planned to add is subsumed in #10451.

Release manager: please close as duplicate, and *do not* merge the patch.
