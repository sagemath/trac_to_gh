Yet another empty object problem

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/florent/src/Sage/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/combinat/permutation.pyc in to_standard(p)
   4243 
   4244     s = p[:]
-> 4245     biggest = max(p) + 1
   4246     i = 1
   4247     for _ in range(len(p)):

ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
```
should be 

```
[]
```

I also fixed the return type of {{{from_reduced_word([])}}.
