The 'sage-fix-pkg-checksums' utility is not (yet) available as an option of 'sage'. This branch fixes it.

Good idea. Since fixing the checksums belongs more to the "creation" of packages than to the "installation" of packages, I moved that option into the section `Making Sage packages or distributions:` of `sage -advanced`.

I let you review my commit (I agree with yours).
