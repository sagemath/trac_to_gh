```
sage: G=PermutationGroup([(1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8)], [(1,7,3,5),(2,6,4,8)])
sage: G
Permutation Group with generators [(5,6,7,8), (1,2,3,4)]
sage: G.order()
16
sage: G = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4),(5,6,7,8)], [(1,7,3,5),(2,6,4,8)]])                                                                                                                                                                           
sage: G                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Permutation Group with generators [(1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8), (1,7,3,5)(2,6,4,8)]
sage: G.order()
8
```

This shows up in the Sage construction given on [groupnames.org](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/1/Q8.html) for example.

The second argument to PermutationGroup is gap_group, which is ignored unless it is a string or LibGapElement, or gens is None.  I think an error should be raised unless it is None, a string or a LibGapElement.

I would suggest making all but the `gens` argument keyword-only, because that would avoid any possibility of confusion (but would require a deprecation period).

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I think that is a good idea. I have done it. Ready for review.

There's a test failure in `File "src/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup_element.pyx", line 966`.  Otherwise, I'm happy.

Fixed. That doctest had bad input (using 5 to signify the size of the domain, which didn't work before this ticket), so I just removed it.
