This shows up in the Sage construction given on [groupnames.org](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/1/Q8.html) for example.

The second argument to PermutationGroup is gap_group, which is ignored unless it is a string or LibGapElement, or gens is None.  I think an error should be raised unless it is None, a string or a LibGapElement.
