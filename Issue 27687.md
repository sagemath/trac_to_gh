I am a little uncertain whether or not to compute the reflection length in the unitary group or not.

Reflection length is the minimal number of reflections needed to write the element, `in_unitary_group` means the dimension of the move-space dim(w-1).

Both are equal for real groups and, in complex groups, for elements below Coxeter elements. It remains unclear to me whether or not we are allowed to use `in_unitary_group` here for the computation (which is in general much faster).

I tried using `in_unitary_group` and the timings were similar.

By the way, I cannot test with gap3, as I am not able to install Chevie.

Using reflection lengths, we get
