I am a little uncertain whether or not to compute the reflection length in the unitary group or not.

Reflection length is the minimal number of reflections needed to write the element, `in_unitary_group` means the dimension of the move-space dim(w-1).

Both are equal for real groups and, in complex groups, for elements below Coxeter elements. It remains unclear to me whether or not we are allowed to use `in_unitary_group` here for the computation (which is in general much faster).

By the way, I cannot test with gap3, as I am not able to install Chevie.

There is no difference for real groups, but there is for non-real complex groups:
Using reflection lengths, we get

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup([3,1,4])
sage: %time len(list(W.elements_below_coxeter_element()))
