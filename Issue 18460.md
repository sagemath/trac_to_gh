# Issue 18460: any FP number in an Expression without symbol should trigger evaluation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2015-06-14 07:05:27


```
sage: 0.1 * cos(pi/13)
0.100000000000000*cos(1/13*pi)
```

This is annoying because the `0.1` at once limits the precision of any other non-symbolic expression.

People will complain if they cannot change this behaviour, so we need a hold context.

Partial "fix" of Sage code removed, it was actually an unrelated Pynac issue, which is fixed in 0.4.2.

The problem with this ticket is shown by

```
    sage: pi + RBF(1)
```

The expected output would be `[4.141592653589793 +/- 5.61e-16]`, i.e. the same as with `RBF(pi) + RBF(1)`. Constant conversions thus need to take the right parent into account. There may be multiple incompatible parents and that fact may be hidden deep in the expression tree.

This is not a problem because we are evaluating depth-first. The only problem at all seems de-facto limited precision constants, in spite of #18255. Also this might be in the way: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/311
