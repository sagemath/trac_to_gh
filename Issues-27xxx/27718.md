When using the short form for graph generation with a dictionary, the following is accepted:

```
sage: G1 = Graph({1: [3], 2: [0], 1: [2]})
```

But when plotting this, it becomes clear that the vertex `3` is wiped out.  So ... probably this is user error, I admit.

**But** I think it is a user error that should be warned against, as especially with typos it would be very easy to occur (not to mention bad programming where a loop recurs without intent).  Any ideas?

Feel free to put positive review and your name in the Reviewer section.  Or do you think it would be worth adding an example in the documentation (for graphs, I mean) to warn about this for people who aren't familiar with (or forgot!) this property of `dict`?
