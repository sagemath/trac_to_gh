When using the short form for graph generation with a dictionary, the following is accepted:

```
sage: G1 = Graph({1: [3], 2: [0], 1: [2]})
```

But when plotting this, it becomes clear that the vertex `3` is wiped out.  So ... probably this is user error, I admit.

**But** I think it is a user error that should be warned against, as especially with typos it would be very easy to occur (not to mention bad programming where a loop recurs without intent).  Any ideas?

If you want to change that, you must change `dict`, not graph constructors.

```
sage: D = {1: [3], 2: [0], 1: [2]}
sage: D

Feel free to put positive review and your name in the Reviewer section.  Or do you think it would be worth adding an example in the documentation (for graphs, I mean) to warn about this for people who aren't familiar with (or forgot!) this property of `dict`?
