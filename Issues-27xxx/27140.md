The problem is that this

```
make_any_gap_element(self.parent(), result)
```
should not be run under `sig_on()`.

CC @embray because he might know why this is done this way and whether this `make_any_gap_element` call needs to be protected by either `sig_on()` or `GAP_Enter()`.

For reference, this is the code structure for the PARI interface:

- convert input to PARI
- `sig_on()`
- call PARI function
- `sig_off()`
- wrap output in Python object

It should be this way for GAP too.

I need to take a closer look at the code but I'm sure you're right that it needs to be more precisely bracketed in its use of `sig_on()/sig_off()`.  Some of that will be refactored soon too, especially when I bring in some of the upstream changes that expanded the official "libgap API" (I mentioned this also in #27094).

No, I only want to protect `GAP_Enter` and `GAP_Leave`. So something like

```
sig_on()
sig_block()
GAP_Enter()
sig_unblock()
<actual GAP call>
sig_block()
GAP_Enter()
sig_unblock()
sig_off()
```
Of course, we could use macros to make this less painfull to write.

This fixes the `__pow__` call. For now, I decided to fix only that instead of all such GAP calls. This in order to get #26992 merged and to get some feedback on the general mechanism.
