#26315 broke building giac on some systems that have a old-ish libstdc++.  It is completely mysterious to me *why* this broke when it worked before, and without a repository it's very difficult to determine what change between the versions is responsible, as there is little difference between the two versions in the relevant code.

Nevertheless, it can be fixed by explicitly using `std::isnan` and `std::isinf` so that there is no risk of them conflicting with the libc math.h equivalents thereof.

Replying to [jdemeyer](#comment%3A3):
> This might also have been caused by #26787.


According to my research this occurs with or without `-std=c++11` but I haven't explicitly tested that.

I will also try to bring it up upstream in case there is *any* idea.

Right now in `sage-env-config` I have

```
export CONFIGURED_CXX="g++ -std=gnu++11 -std=gnu++11"
```

I don't know why the `-std=gnu++11` is repeated.  Conceivably it might also matter that it's `gnu++11` and not `c++11`.  Perhaps this older gcc is not fully c++11-compatible?

In any case, what would be the best approach here, do you think?  Would it be reasonable to just `unset CXX` in the `spkg-install`?

The only way I think you can end up with that is for `CXX` to be `g++ -std=gnu++11` at configuration time. The macro will then happily add another one because it is fairly stupid.

Don't think so but I am a C++ bigwig.

Most certainly. Before gcc-5 C++11 support was experimental and the implementation was not fixed in stone.

I'd rather have that little patch here.

In theory yes, but this only matters for systems that otherwise simply cannot built giac, so you don't need to do this bumping for all practical purposes.
