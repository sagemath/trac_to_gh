Now Sage will try using libpng from your system. Blindly doing `./sage -f libpng` might actually be breaking your build, if it is not followed by `./configure`.
In any event, this is one of significant changes to configure, and all bets are off whether `make distclean` is needed. 

Could you try uninstalling `libpng` ? (`make libpng-clean`), then `./configure`

I will give a try, but it should also work with the `libpng` provided by Sage.
