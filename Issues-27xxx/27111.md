This example should show what's wrong. It claims a rank 4 module is equal to a rank 2 module.

```
sage: J = J0(22)
sage: E = J.endomorphism_ring()
sage: T = E.image_of_hecke_algebra()
sage: E.free_module()
Free module of degree 16 and rank 4 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1]
[ 0  1  0  0  2 -1  0  0  1 -1  1 -1  0  0  0 -2]
[ 0  0  1  0  1  0 -2  1  1  0 -1  0  1  1 -1 -1]
[ 0  0  0  1  1 -1  0  1  1 -1  0  0  0  0  0 -1]
sage: T.free_module()
Free module of degree 16 and rank 2 over Integer Ring
Echelon basis matrix:
[ 1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1]
[ 0  0  1 -1  0  1 -2  0  0  1 -1  0  1  1 -1  0]
sage: T == E
True
```

The equality testing is calling equality testing as homsets which is not useful in this setting.

```
def __eq__(self, other):
    """
    For two homsets, it is tested whether the domain, the codomain and
    the category coincide.
    ...
    """
```

This ticket will change equality testing to equality as ZZ-modules. This ticket will also add a rank method which is the rank as a ZZ-module.
