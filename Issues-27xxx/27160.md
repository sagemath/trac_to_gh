I changed the proposed fixes to avoid `# py2` and `#py 3` tags.
- `hyperbolicity`: it is more robust to avoid sorting vertex ids of the certificate before returning it, and to sort these ids in the doctests
- `graph_coloring`: we now sort the output of some doctests

Note that the lines you edited about approximation of hyperbolicity for grids an cycles now go over 80 characters. (also true for other lines of both files, but outside of the aim of this ticket)

Is it a problem? If not I am fine with the patch.
