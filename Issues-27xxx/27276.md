(From the discussion of #27085.)

In this ticket, we add a method `to_pyplot` that will put the object in a pyplot figure to every graphics object class (including `GraphicsArray`s and the 3D graphics objects). 

This will allow users to interoperate sage graphics with pure `matplotlib.pyplot` code.

In particular, for plots in the sphinx documentation, the `sphinx_plot` function provided by `src/doc/common/conf.py` can be removed, and calls to it replaced by method calls to `to_pyplot`.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
