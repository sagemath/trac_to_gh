(From the discussion of #27085.)

In this ticket, we add a method `to_pyplot` that will put the object in a pyplot figure to every graphics object class (including `GraphicsArray`s and the 3D graphics objects). 

This will allow users to interoperate sage graphics with pure `matplotlib.pyplot` code.

In particular, for plots in the sphinx documentation, the `sphinx_plot` function provided by `src/doc/common/conf.py` can be removed, and calls to it replaced by method calls to `to_pyplot`.
