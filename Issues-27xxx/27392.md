The definition is a little awkward in English to me. I would write

```
        This is defined as the signature of the symmetric matrix

        .. MATH::

             V + V^{t},

        where `V` is the :meth:`Seifert matrix <seifert_matrix>`.
```
Another option would be a separate initial sentence <code>Let `V` be the :meth:`Seifert matrix <seifert_matrix>`.</code>

Otherwise LGTM.
