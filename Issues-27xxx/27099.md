First of all, the name `is_extension_type` is misleading: it *actually* tests whether instances of the class have a `__dict__`. While extension types usually don't and Python classes usually do, in both cases the opposite is possible.

Moreover, it is used in only one place (namely to determine whether to use actual inheritance from the category for `Element` classes). And this usage is there mostly for historical reasons (see also #24715).

Since `is_extension_type()` is the only function remaining in `sage.structure.misc`, we actually deprecate that whole module.

One further minor change is that an element class can no longer be an old-style class. This was not an issue in practice, since most (if not all) `Element` classes derive from `sage.structure.element.Element`. But two tests with simple old-style `Element` classes had to be fixed.
