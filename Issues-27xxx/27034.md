Introduce a new class `PolynomialRingMorphism` for morphisms from a polynomial ring to any ring. It is defined by a morphism from the base ring to the codomain and by the image of the generators.

This generalizes the existing `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` because it also allows a non-trivial morphism on the base ring.

It is meant to be used by #25558 and possibly #26105.

This feature seems already available (ie `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` has a keyword `base_map`)

```
sage: K = GF(9)
sage: phi = K.frobenius_endomorphism()
sage: R = K['x,y']
sage: x,y = R.gens()
sage: f = R.hom([y,x], base_map=phi)
sage: f
Ring endomorphism of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Finite Field in z2 of size 3^2
  Defn: x |--> y
        y |--> x
        with map of base ring
sage: f(K.gen()*x+y)
x + (-z2 + 1)*y
```
