Add a kenzo optional package, and the corresponding interface.

The source file is taken from https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo, which is a small fork by Miguel Marco to include some utility scripts from https://github.com/gheber/kenzo, which is in turn a fork of the original source code modified to be compatible with other lisps (in particular it works on ecl).

**Tarball** (to be renamed `kenzo-1.1.7-r1.tar.gz`):

- â€‹https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo/archive/1.1.7-r1.tar.gz

(Miguel Marco is maintaining a fork for the moment, this version includes a script to compile kenzo into a .fas file).

The interface uses the ecl interface, and provides a wrapper for some kenzo objects (we hope to extend it in the future).

That is the long term idea we had in mind for starting this; but we still haven't decided the design.

Maybe include an attribute for each Sage simplicial set that is a reference to the corresponding kenzo object (via this interface)?

Right now we have just coded the bare minimum kenzo functionality, but for that task maybe we should add support for explicit list of faces and maps.

Switched to another upstream source. It is a fork I made to be able to include some utility scripts that we might need.

For the moment, it includes a script to compile all kenzo in a self-contained .fasl file, that we can easily load without problems both from python2 and python3.

I think it is pretty much ready to be tested.

Thank you. This is improving, but there are a few more specific things to be fixed (although with these done, it should be at a positive review).

Yes, `__init__` needs to have a doctest. I think it is the best place to put the `TestSuite(foo).run()` test. I also would move the `INPUT:` block to the class level docstring as the `__init__` docstring is not in the documentation.

Change `__repr__` -> `_repr_` (which allows you to run `foo.rename('bar')` on it).

There are still some malformatted docstrings:

```diff
 def Sphere(n):
     r"""
-    Construct the n dimensional sphere, which is a simplicial set.
+    Return the ``n`` dimensional sphere as a Kenzo simplicial set.
 
     INPUT:
 
-    - ``n`` - The dimension of the sphere
+    - ``n`` -- the dimension of the sphere
```

```diff
-def MooreSpace(n, m):
+def MooreSpace(m, n):
     r"""
-    Construct the Moore space ``M(m, n)``. That is, the space
-    that has n'th homology group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order ``m``,
-    and the rest of the homology groups are trivial. It is a simplicial set.
+    Return the Moore space `M(m, n)` as a Kenzo simplicial set.
 
+    The Moore space `M(m, n)` is the space whose `n`-th homology group
+    is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order `m`, and the rest of
+    the homology groups are trivial.
 
     INPUT:
 
-    - ``m```- A positive integer. The order of the nontrivial homology group.
+    - ``m`` -- a positive integer; the order of the nontrivial homology group
 
-    - ``n```- The dimension in which the homology is not trivial
+    - ``n`` -- the dimension in which the homology is not trivial
```
Similar comments for `EilenbergMacLaneSpace`. (I opted for `return` for the short descriptions, but `construct` is okay with me as well.)

```diff
-        - ``kenzoobject``- a wrapper around a kenzo chain complex
-        (which is an ecl object).
+        - ``kenzoobject`` -- a wrapper around a kenzo chain complex
+          (which is an ecl object)
```
Similar comment for `loop_space()`, and a stray ``` there as well: `- `A KenzoSimplicialGroup`.

For the doctests (e.g., in `loop_space()`), it is not so important to test the `type(l2)` but it would be more useful to see either the output or a meaningful test. For example, in the suspension doctest, the result would have a homology of **Z** only in the 4th degree (since the homology group (= homology group in this case) for `e2` (why not call it `e3`?) is **Z** in the 3rd degree).

You could instead skip that part of the test suite (`TestSuite(foo).run(skip='_test_pickling')`.

There are benefits to inheriting from SageObject, so I would rather skip part of the test suite than not inherit from this.

which should **not** be in the docstring.

`MooreSpace`, `EilenbergMacLaneSpace` and `KenzoChainComplex` have malformatted docstrings., e.g.:

```diff
-        - ``kenzoobject``- a wrapper around a kenzo chain complex
-        (which is an ecl object).
+        - ``kenzoobject`` -- a wrapper around a kenzo chain complex
+          (which is an ecl object)
```

```diff
-    - ``G`` -- A group. Currently only ``ZZ`` and the group of two elements are
-    supported.
+    - ``G`` -- group; currently only ``ZZ`` and the group of two elements are
+      supported
 
-    - ``n`` -- The dimension in which the homotopy is not trivial
+    - ``n`` -- the dimension in which the homotopy is not trivial
```
Also, in this particular docstring, there is not a unique group of 2 elements. Moreover, does it have to be `GF(2)`? Does `G` need to be additive or can it be multiplicative?

In the tests for `EilenbergMacLaneSpace`, it is better to use `G is ZZ`.

```diff
-Wraper to kenzo chain complexes
+Wrapper to kenzo chain complexes.
```

For future-proofing, it probably would be better to have a `KenzoObject` class above `KenzoChainComplex` with the `__init__` and `_repr_` methods.

It is more pythonic to do `repr(self._kenzo)` instead of `self._kenzo.__repr__()`. Similarly, `kenzo_object` instead of `kenzoobject` for variable names.

We can check things abstractly since it gets fed off to a Kenzo object. Specifically, I am thinking of this:

```python
elif G in CommutativeAdditiveGroups() and G.cardinality() == 2:
```
Also you should add a note to the doc saying that the group must be additive.

It is just some replacements in the doc to add links to the appropriate classes so it looks a little better. `;)`

Thank you, but there are a few more little bits.

See[comment:32](#comment%3A32) on `MooreSpace` `INPUT:` block.

The `INPUT:` for `KenzoObject` is over indented.

It would be good to put the one-line description for `EilenbergMacLaneSpace` on its own line (I also thought the convention for Eilenberg-MacLane spaces was to be with a capital `K`?). I would prefer the more "standard" (in the sense of the [dev guide](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings)) docstring (see[comment:32](#comment%3A32)), but at least it is not malformatted.

They can contain dashes, underscores, etc.; e.g.:

```
lidia-2.3.0+latte-patches-2014-10-04.tar.gz
jmol-14.6.1_2016.07.11.tar.bz2

I don't think we have any specific conventions for tarball names in general other than date formats yyyymmdd for things that do not have version numbers or a sha1.
