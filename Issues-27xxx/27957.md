Looks good overall. I just have a few comments.

I think it is better to be more specific about where you are importing stuff

```diff
-from sage.modules.all import vector
-from sage.matrix.all import matrix, MatrixSpace
+from sage.modules.free_module_element import vector
+from sage.matrix.constructor import matrix
+from sage.matrix.matrix_space import MatrixSpace
```
This can help limit circular imports.

I don't understand why you have the function `cartier_fixed` in `CartierCode.__init__`. It is only called once and just has one return statement at the bottom.

I don't think it is a good idea to assume the doctests will be run in order. (In fact, I think there is a ticket looking to run them in any order.) I wouldn't rely on a saved object. I would instead suggest having a pickle in the file (or a separate test file) as a string (or a pickle stored somewhere) that you can load.

```diff
-As well known, the two kinds of AG codes are dual to each other. ::
+As is well known, the two kinds of AG codes are dual to each other. ::
```

Something else you can do for `__eq__` is first test ``if self is other:`` to short-circuit when comparing against the same object.

In `DifferentialAGCodeUniqueDecoder._encode` and `_decode`, you have `TESTS:` with one colon.

Do you want `_Decoder_K` to be hidden from the documentation? Since it is a key component, it might be good to include it.

Since `_Decoder_K` and `_Decoder_K_extension` and their subclasses seem like the key workhorses, would it make sense to include them as a separate Cython file and make them `cdef` classes?

I am not sure about variable scope here:

```python
        # compute xR
        for xR in Q.divisor(gamma).basis_function_space():
            if xR.valuation(Q) == -gamma:
                break
```
I think it would be better to do

```python
        def compute_xR():
            for xR in Q.divisor(gamma).basis_function_space():
                if xR.valuation(Q) == -gamma:
                    return xR
        xR = compute_xR()
```
I thought Python3 didn't allow variables to leak out of scope like that anymore? Well, I find this to be a little safer. Another option would be

```python
        for b in Q.divisor(gamma).basis_function_space():
            if b.valuation(Q) == -gamma:
                xR = b
                break
```

To encapsulate the code in `cartier_fixed`. I didn't want the variables defined inside to affect the code outside. Moreover the code is natural for a general divisor `E`, but is applied to the specific divisor `G-D`.

It is a key component. But the user does not need to interact with it. So the class name starts with an underline. It works in the background. The classes before it define the interface for the user. So I think it should be hidden.

It would use the current object (assuming it isn't pickled in some non-standard way) when it is reconstructed. I would have to double-check with the pickling protocols, but the pickle data should only need to be updated in limited circumstances.

I don't see why it needs to be hidden in the documentation. The documentation is also there for the maintainer as well as the user. Although if this is in a separate file, then you could have the "main" class documentation isolated from this.

To Cythonize it, you just need to move your code into a `.pyx`. To make it a bit better, you add `cdef` before each class and create `.pxd` file (the `.pxd` is like a `.h` header file in C) with those class declarations. There should be a number of easily accessible examples for this; e.g., `groups/group.pxd`.

> > I am not sure about variable scope here:

The key difference is the `return` statement aborting the run part of the way through the loop that should set a variable.

I inlined the code removing `cartier_fixed` encapsulation. I am okay with this, but it seems to me that the code lost a little bit of readibility.

Okay. Done.

I still don't get your idea. If `_Decoder_K` is included in the documentation (by removing the leading underline), then the methods (`substitution`, `exponents`, ...) of the class will be exposed. Those methods happened to be there just for implementation efficiency, and never intended to be used by a user. I think implementation details should not be exposed in the documentation.

Done. I see 10% speed increase in doctesting by cythonization. Thanks.

I restored the structure of the code close to the original while keeping the most of your speed improvements. A little bit of speed was lost, which I guess is due to converting inline functions to methods. I removed some castings which I think unnecessary, to improve readibility.

So I mostly agree. You can still make the methods inline IIRC. Yet, I don't think there isn't any reason to remove a casting as it decreases the readability of the code since now we don't know what type of object it should be. This also has an effect on speed because the C code becomes more complicated.

Those decorators on the helper functions are also important for speed as they remove a number of safety checks that performed to prevent crashes that we are guaranteeing are not happening. They have no effect on readability IMO.

Also, these are useful because it simplifies how Cython translates it into C code:

```
-                    wlt = gamma * dlt + <Py_ssize_t> (dR[i])
+                    wlt = gamma * dlt + dR[i]
```
(Ideally, I would want things like `dR` to be C arrays, but then we have to manually deal with pickling.)

One other thing that might be useful would be having the `degree` return an actual `int` object.

If you want to look at the compiled C code, you can find it at

```
$SAGE_ROOT/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/cythonized/sage/coding/ag_code_decoders.c
```
Just search for a line number of line of code in the pyx file (e.g., 1135 but not 1092 or 1124). You don't necessarily have to understand it, but you can get a feel of the complexity, which roughly corresponds to time needed.

A profiling showed that the most time consuming part of the decoder is `_substitution` method. So I tried to optimize the code for speed in the last commit.

According to simple tests, the performance of the decoder has improved after each revision after cythonization.

Thank you for the further changes and testing for the timing. I tried to really optimize the `_substitute` as much as I could by not creating as many transient objects by again modifying the input. Likewise, I just changes `gbmat` into `mat` as the list of (row) vectors is what you really wanted to manipulate.

From looking at the C code, there was no different with the extra `<Polynomial>` casts in `_substitute()`. So I just removed them for readability.

Some of the other changes I made in accordance with the change to `mat` might affect readability for trivial speed improvements; so feel free to revert.

Okay. I am getting intoxicated with what cythonization brings and caring readibility less :-)

Still I removed, for instance, `<FreeModuleElement>` from

```
temp = <FreeModuleElement> (<list> mul_mat[j])[i]
```
since `temp` is already declared  as `<FreeModuleElement>` type before, and hence I think casting is unnecessary. I wonder if you would agree.

The pickles would be part of the Sage lib. Why pickles are more vulnerable than other code? Do you imagine that some evil author and reviewer cooperate to slip in the evil code passing the release manager's eyes? 

> say, some extra method that is monkey-patched into `__init__` that deletes everything on the system

Is this possible with a pickle? As far as I know, a pickle does not contain code.

> We also haven't done anything like this in Sage (at least since we removed the pickle jar). So I just want to be a bit cautious here before proceeding.

I agree. I also wondered if there should be a central place to hold the pickles for this doctesting purpose. Note that I added `.../coding/tests` directory for this purpose.

You end up reading a file on the system and (blindly) executing it in the doctest.

A pickle can (and IIRC usually) contain an objects `__dict__`, which can contain functions that can be bound to the object I believe. I am not really an expert on this, so it is possible I am just being paranoid (or there are other more likely security breaches to occur).

I saw that and thought that was good. The only place that was natural to me is in the `$SAGE_SRC/tests` folder (possibly as a `coding` subfolder).

Okay.

This sounds not much different from what I did originally. Moreover I don't want to clutter the code only for testing things. I think we did enough for this ticket regarding doctesting.

The difference would be that it is created as part of the Sage session that is easily modified. However, I agree that the current state is sufficient (despite lacking a good solution). So we can set this to a positive review once the patchbot comes back green.
