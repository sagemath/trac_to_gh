The `FusionRing`, implemented in #26440 is the WZW fusion or Verlinde algebra. It needs certain methods to be useful: the twist or ribbon element, the S-matrix and the quantum dimension. This ticket is to implement these methods.

The ticket #29615 is related to this one.

Work issues:

* Further testing is needed. This should be able to duplicate the tables in arXiv:0712.1377: On classification of modular tensor categories. Eric Rowell, Richard Stong, Zhenghan Wang.
* Add a reference to that paper.
* Some methods need docstrings.
* `s_matrix` should return entries in a `CyclotomicField`, not `CC`.
* `s_matrix` element method should be kept but the code within the loop `for i in rng:` should be split off so the user can optionally work with an individual pair of elements rather than a matrix.
* Type E s-matrices seem conjugated. Figure out why.

Design decisions:

* Should the `FusionRing` be moved to a separate file? (*perhaps not necessary unless code becomes much longer*)
* What is the right way to make methods special to `FusionRing` not available to parent class `WeylCharacterRing`? (*fixed*)
* Can the `ordered_basis`, `fusion_labels` and `basis` methods be intelligently reorganized, and can we use python `OrderedDict` for the basis?

Figure out the right `CyclotomicField` which may be the square root of the one currently used.

There is the `UniversalCyclotomicField` if you do not want to be so careful about which roots you want.

As for making methods special to `FusionRing` not for the WCR, you should put those methods in the subclass.

The original[comment:3](#comment%3A3) is not clear but the issue is actually with `WeylCharacterRing.Element` methods.
that only pertain to `FusionRing` elements.

So I checked that the following works. We add a `FusionRing.Element` class that inherits from
`WeylCharacterRing.Element`. Then we move the `WeylCharacterRing.Element` methods such
as `is_simple_obj`,`twists`, etc. to the new class.

This patch is important but was neglected for a while. We are reviving it. The old branch was called `public/fusion-27036` but this has been superceded by `public/fusion_ring_operations-27036`.

* The old patch was ported to python3 and recent development branch by  physicstravels.
* The ordered_basis method has been abandoned in favor of a scheme based on the get_order and set_order methods of `CombinatorialFreeModule`.
* The method `fusion_matrix` was eliminated.

A work issue: the `get_order` method of `CombinatorialFreeModule` is cached and this can cause incorrect results if the order is changed using `set_order`. Example:

```
sage: A13=FusionRing("A1",3)
sage: b = list(A13.basis().keys()); b
[(0, 0), (1/2, -1/2), (1, -1), (3/2, -3/2)]
sage: b.reverse(); b
[(3/2, -3/2), (1, -1), (1/2, -1/2), (0, 0)]
sage: A13.set_order(b)
sage: A13.get_order()
[(0, 0), (1/2, -1/2), (1, -1), (3/2, -3/2)]
```

This does not happen every time. Sometimes the correct order is reported after exactly these commands. More testing is needed to say whether there is a reproducible failure.

An obvious fix (not tried yet) would be to remove the ``@`cached_method` from `get_order` in `free_module.py`. One can argue that the caching is of minimal value. When get_order is called, if `self._order` is not `None`, its contents is returned. This is what will happen every time it is called except the first time. So arguably the value of the caching is small, and has the effect of breaking `set_order`.

Isn't this a problem for other `CombinatorialFreeModules` besides `FusionRings`?

In the reference manual, the `FusionRing` methods are mixed up with the `WeylCharacterRing` methods.

Is there a way to keep them separate?

Do we need to move the FusionRing class to a separate file?

I went through and did some changes.

The most significant is to `q_dimension` to not do the division where there could be a lot of cancelling factors. This might be slower when no factors will cancel (I didn't test), but I expect it to be asymptotically faster.

I remove the resetting of the order when calling `fusion_labels()` as I think this functionality should be kept separate.

I also added an explicit parameter in `fusion_labels()` to ask the user if they want to inject the variables. If this happened by default (or always), it could have very subtle side effects, lost computations, or errors because the variable name is not in the correct format.

Everything else was documentation related.

I wasn't aware of that. Thank you for catching that. If

The references in `combinat/dyck_words.py` probably should be moved to the master reference file to avoid this as well, but that is for another ticket.

One additional trivial thing to fix:

```diff
     def get_order(self):
-        r"""This returns the weights of the basis vectors in a fixed order.
+        r"""
+        Return the weights of the basis vectors in a fixed order.
+
         You may change the order of the basis using :meth:`CombinatorialFreeModule.set_order`
```

Once done, I think we can set a positive review as we can change the caching in `combinat/free_module.py` easily enough on a later ticket.

The Verlinde formula is not quite stated in the usual way, because a complex conjugation is omitted, and `N_ijk` is used instead of `Nk_ij`. This appears to be correct (on the basis of testing) but why is it correct mathematically?

Since this isue came up I'm temporarily changing the ticket to Needs Work.
