The pickle `cluster_algebra_quiver/mutation_classes_%s.dig6` currently depends on the Python version: pickles created with Python 3 cannot be opened with Python 2.

There are multiple solutions to this, such as ensuring that a pickle is always stored in a compatible version. But since these pickles are optional, a simpler solution is simply ignoring unpickling errors.
