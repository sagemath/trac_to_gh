Here's a bit of improvement, I think, to the `Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs` method implementation.

In particular, it does away with most of the manual string formatting of JavaScript in favor of just using the `json` module to do this.  It also uses jinja2 for rendering the `threejs_template.html` template.  This may prove more flexible in the future.

I did a bit of performance testing on this, and compared to the overhead of actually generating 3D models and the like, the performance difference between this approach and the old code is negligible--they are about the same.  However, I think this approach results in cleaner code.

This is just a preliminary to some more specific changes toward #22408 (making ThreeJS the default 3D graphics viewer).

A minimal example yielding to a similar error is

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3)
show(E.cartesian_coordinates().plot(), viewer='threejs')
```
One gets 

```
TypeError: Object of type 'RealDoubleElement' is not JSON serializable
```
from line 450 of `src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`:

```
    SAGE_TEXTS=json.dumps(texts),
