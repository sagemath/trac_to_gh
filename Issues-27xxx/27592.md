Here's a bit of improvement, I think, to the `Graphics3d._rich_repr_threejs` method implementation.

In particular, it does away with most of the manual string formatting of JavaScript in favor of just using the `json` module to do this.  It also uses jinja2 for rendering the `threejs_template.html` template.  This may prove more flexible in the future.

I did a bit of performance testing on this, and compared to the overhead of actually generating 3D models and the like, the performance difference between this approach and the old code is negligible--they are about the same.  However, I think this approach results in cleaner code.

This is just a preliminary to some more specific changes toward #22408 (making ThreeJS the default 3D graphics viewer).

Depends on #27568

Hi Erik, happy to see that you are working on threejs!

Have you noticed the (very) recent improvements:
- #27575: Three.js: Fix CDN Fallback
- #27568: Three.js: Consolidate Surface Code
- #27561: Fix Minor Three.js Template Error

With this ticket branch pulled in Sage 8.8.beta0, the notebook
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sagemanifolds/SageManifolds/blob/master/Worksheets/v1.3/SM_AdS.ipynb
fails in cell [15], which regards 3D plot of lines. The error is 

```
TypeError: Object of type 'Integer' is not JSON serializable
```
and arises from line 456 of `src/sage/plot/plot3d/base.pyx`:

```
    SAGE_LINES=json.dumps(lines),
```
The full traceback is copied below.

The same notebook works well with Sage 8.8.beta0 (python3-built).

A minimal example yielding to a similar error is

```
E = EuclideanSpace(3)
show(E.cartesian_coordinates().plot(), viewer='threejs')
```
One gets 

```
TypeError: Object of type 'RealDoubleElement' is not JSON serializable

Okay, I see.  What we're lacking is JSON serialization for some basic Sage types.

While it would be overkill to add that just for this ticket, it would be a useful thing to have in its own right.  I'll at least get something started for that...

The manual JSON construction of points, lines, texts, and surfaces was cleaned up independently as part of #29227.

The clean up of the `bounds`, `lights`, and `ambient` JSONs as well as the imports clean up from this branch would be nice to have, though.

I do also really like the idea of using Jinja instead of string replacements from this ticket. Could even replace my somewhat hacky conditional inclusion of the new animation.html/css/js files with commands in the template. Something like:

```
{% if animate %}
<style>{% include 'animation.css' %}</style>
<script>{% include 'animation.js' %}</script>
{% include 'animation.html' %}
{% endif %}

I completely forgot about this ticket (almost 2 years old as you can see) but maybe I can rebase it on top of your work and incorporate Jinja into it.
