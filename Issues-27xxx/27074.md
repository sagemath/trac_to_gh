It's relatively easy using import system hooks in Python to make new file types 'importable' using the standard import statement.  E.g. a file like `mymodule.sage` could be imported as `mymodule` just as though it were `mymodule.py`.

Importing a `.sage` module is of course just a thin layer over a normal Python module import, but to pass it through the Sage preparser.

There are of course some risks to making `.sage` modules importable.  For example, what if a user has both a `foo.sage` and an `foo.py`?  Which one takes priority upon `import foo`?  In particular it could introduce quite some surprises if a user has something like `os.sage` in their current directory.

Unfortunately it's not possible to extend the syntax of import statements, which would be nice.  But, while the "module name" portion of an import statement must be a valid identifier, we can still otherwise process it however we want.  So maybe `.sage` module imports would be initiated only if `.sage` is used explicitly in the import statement.  So for example, to import a sage module named `foo.sage` one would literally write:

```
import foo.sage
```

to distinguish it from a Python module named `foo.py`.  Of course, if there is a Python *package* named `foo` that happens to have a `sage` sub-module there is still a conflict.  But this is a bit unlikely for most cases.

So in order to make such a feature available, while mitigating potential problems with it, I might suggest a few additional restrictions:

1. There would be a function to enable/disable `.sage` import functionality on the fly.  When first introduced this would be disabled by default, but we would certainly want to make the feature easily discoverable through the documentation, with all the caveats discussed.

2. In the off chance that there is a conflict between a `.sage` module an a plain Python module, the system should check for that.  In that case the `.sage` module still takes priority (if `.sage` imports are enabled), but a warning about the conflict is shown.

3. This feature should be Python 3 only.  That will make it easier to implement, due to the significant differences between the import systems, and it will also give a nice motivation, to anyone who wants the feature, to switch to Python 3.

Perhaps so.  The idea there was just to make it less likely for it to shadow Python modules on `sys.path` that have absolutely nothing to do with Sage, and cause sudden strange breakage.

But if the other mitigation strategies for that are employed, then perhaps we don't need to use that convention in the first place.  Also, many stdlib libraries would likely be imported already by the time the import hooks necessary for supporting `.sage` imports are loaded.  So for example, it's not likely that having an `os.sage` will cause `import os` to break because it will have already been imported (the downside to that is that then trying to import their local `os.sage` will quietly fail, but I think we can still consider this somewhat "intermediate usage" where one has to at least understand what Python imports are and not to name things the same as system libraries...)

Again, this is no different from having an `os.py` file in the current directory and running `import os` (technical note: `os` is a special built-in module which ignores the usual import system).

I agree with this.

However the ability to import `.sage` files should be optional, and switchable at runtime, as Erik suggested. Otherwise it could break code that is now working.

Still, if there's `foo.py` and `foo.sage` in the same dir, which should shadow which? I'd say `foo.py` takes priority.

That's true about `os`; I've seen this more often with things like "string" or "logging".

And I agree it's no different. My only point is that *currently* it does not work that way for `.sage` files, so if we implement this it has to be opt-in, at least at first, because suddenly producing side-effects based on files the user happens to have in their working directory is user-hostile.

This would considerably ease the prototyping of new extensions (which currently require forking a branch and re`make`ing it for test.

Would you consider this aspect of the issue in future development ?

I'm afraid I don't see at all how that's related.  This is just about making `.sage` files importable through the normal Python import system.  Monkey-patching classes is a thing you can already do, having relatively little to do with how modules are imported.

Nicolas worked on something like this with https://github.com/nthiery/recursive-monkey-patch so you might want to ask him about it.
