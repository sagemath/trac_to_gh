It fixes #27538. Now, cycle_basis() for multiedges works correctly. 

```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)
sage: G.cycle_basis()
[[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4]]
```
\\ Currently, I am importing Graph from sage.graphs.graph in cycle_basis function to create instance of Graph. Suggestions are invited for any alternate approach.
