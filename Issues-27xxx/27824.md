Do not install python3 if a sufficiently new version is available in `$PATH`. This could be a system python3, or the python3 from within a venv.

As suggested in #29032, we make $SAGE_LOCAL a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) over the system python3 -- if a suitable system python3 is found -- by using the `venv.EnvBuilder` API. 

This is done by the new script `build/bin/sage-venv`, which we use both during `configure` (to make sure that we select a system python3 for which venvs work correctly) and during `make`.

The venv does not include the system site-packages: We continue to install all Python packages into our venv using the existing build infrastructure. We keep the task of using system site-packages for the follow-up ticket #29023.

(Note, we use `venv` (new since Python 3.3), not `virtualenv`. So this change is limited to Python 3 builds of Sage.)

`$SAGE_LOCAL` *already* acts as a sort-of virtualenv, but we might still consider using virtualenv/venv in `$SAGE_LOCAL` (with the `--system-site-packages` option) as a way of extending `sys.path` while still using as many system Python packages as possible.

Not sure whether this is a bug on the package, or a bug in this branch.
On this branch I see (with `local=SAGE_LOCAL`)

This amounts to trying to upgrade python3's `venv` to something like a conda environment. This is what I avoid in #29013 on purpose - the `venv` is only used in a clean, documented way, using the documented tools.

<a id='comment:38'></a>writing `pyvenv.cfg` by hand is bound to be broken at some point, as it's an implementation detail of venv.
The correct interface to `venv` is to use `venv`, I think.

(By the way, the idea of using venv/virtualenv is probably mine, IIRC I put it in the original version of this ticket :-))

That's not true.  It's documented both in the documentation for the `venv` module and the `site` module.  If you really want to avoid writing it by hand the `venv` module includes code for that as well.  This (with the *system* Python 3) is effectively the same (albeit more opaque).  From within SAGE_ROOT, but without the sage environment activated:

```
$ python3 -c 'import venv; b = venv.EnvBuilder(); c = b.ensure_directories("local"); b.create_configuration(c)'
$ cat local/pyvenv.cfg
home = /usr/bin
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.6.8
```

but I think even that's overkill for now.

On this ticket, the system python is not used directly but rather in a venv without site-packages.
Therefore the correct test is to test whether the module will be available in a venv.

module and distutils checking seems to work correctly.

Got stuck at `scipy` install. 

```

Looks like `scipy` would need a sitecfg as well so that it finds BLAS. It's strange that we build numpy with providing `site.cfg` (which we just had to correct in #29025), but `scipy` without `site.cfg`.

`@`fbissey, based on your work on scipy configuration in #20157, would you be able to help with this?

I agree here, it's much simpler for now to focus on using a "bare" Python as much as possible.  I think detecting and using system Python packages *is* where we want to go, but it can get a bit hairier...

Here's a prototype of my alternative approach: #29032

I admit it does not yet address as many issues as this ticket does, like all the site.cfg fixes with Numpy.  Personally I didn't need it, but if those fixes are necessary they can easily be applied to my ticket as well.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello everyone,

When trying to upgrade to 9.1.rc5, I'm seeing an issue that I suspect could be a side effect of this ticket.

For some reason my `sage/local/bin/python3.7` was a symlink to the system python binary. Sage decided it wanted to install its own python-3.7.3.p1, but that failed with a permission error on the symlink. After deleting the symlink, python builds and installs correctly. (I let the logs be overwritten, so I won't be able to provide much details — sorry.)

The overall Sage build still fails with an error about six not being found while building setuptools that I haven't yet investigated.
