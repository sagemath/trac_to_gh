Do not install python3 if a sufficiently new version is available in `$PATH`. This could be a system python3, or the python3 from within a venv.

As suggested in #29032, we make $SAGE_LOCAL a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) over the system python3 -- if a suitable system python3 is found -- by using the `venv.EnvBuilder` API. 

This is done by the new script `build/bin/sage-venv`, which we use both during `configure` (to make sure that we select a system python3 for which venvs work correctly) and during `make`.

The venv does not include the system site-packages: We continue to install all Python packages into our venv using the existing build infrastructure. We keep the task of using system site-packages for the follow-up ticket #29023.

(Note, we use `venv` (new since Python 3.3), not `virtualenv`. So this change is limited to Python 3 builds of Sage.)

`$SAGE_LOCAL` *already* acts as a sort-of virtualenv, but we might still consider using virtualenv/venv in `$SAGE_LOCAL` (with the `--system-site-packages` option) as a way of extending `sys.path` while still using as many system Python packages as possible.

This amounts to trying to upgrade python3's `venv` to something like a conda environment. This is what I avoid in #29013 on purpose - the `venv` is only used in a clean, documented way, using the documented tools.

That's not true.  It's documented both in the documentation for the `venv` module and the `site` module.

$ cat local/pyvenv.cfg
home = /usr/bin
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.6.8
```

but I think even that's overkill for now.

On this ticket, the system python is not used directly but rather in a venv without site-packages.
Therefore the correct test is to test whether the module will be available in a venv.

It’s strictly for making this ticket easier because I don’t have to worry about getting the correct versions of all Python packages.
See #29023 for the next step - let’s discuss any issues regarding use of system site packages there.

I agree here, it's much simpler for now to focus on using a "bare" Python as much as possible.  I think detecting and using system Python packages *is* where we want to go, but it can get a bit hairier...

Here's a prototype of my alternative approach: #29032

I admit it does not yet address as many issues as this ticket does, like all the site.cfg fixes with Numpy.  Personally I didn't need it, but if those fixes are necessary they can easily be applied to my ticket as well.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Hello everyone,

When trying to upgrade to 9.1.rc5, I'm seeing an issue that I suspect could be a side effect of this ticket.

For some reason my `sage/local/bin/python3.7` was a symlink to the system python binary. Sage decided it wanted to install its own python-3.7.3.p1, but that failed with a permission error on the symlink. After deleting the symlink, python builds and installs correctly. (I let the logs be overwritten, so I won't be able to provide much details — sorry.)

The overall Sage build still fails with an error about six not being found while building setuptools that I haven't yet investigated.

it is not clear what version you were on, but the changes to the build system were very substantial, so ymmv.
