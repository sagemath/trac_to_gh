Do not install python3 if a sufficiently new version is available in `$PATH`. This could be a system python3, or the python3 from within a venv.

As suggested in #29032, we make $SAGE_LOCAL a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) over the system python3 -- if a suitable system python3 is found -- by using the `venv.EnvBuilder` API. 

This is done by the new script `build/bin/sage-venv`, which we use both during `configure` (to make sure that we select a system python3 for which venvs work correctly) and during `make`.

The venv does not include the system site-packages: We continue to install all Python packages into our venv using the existing build infrastructure. We keep the task of using system site-packages for the follow-up ticket #29023.

(Note, we use `venv` (new since Python 3.3), not `virtualenv`. So this change is limited to Python 3 builds of Sage.)

Here's a version that works. The venv is created in `build/make/Makefile` target (in #29013, I created the venv in the `spkg-postinst` script of the `python3` spkg.)

I tried this on gentoo (after a usual struggle to get sqlite3 module built in Python)
and it broke at docbuild, with

```
RuntimeError: libSingular not found--a working Singular install in $SAGE_LOCAL is required for Sage to work
```
even though `libSingular` has built just fine (it's some magic with `from sage.env import SINGULAR_SO` that is broken, so `SINGULAR_SO` is `None`)

Compiles OK on macOS with homebrew. `make ptestlong` mostly good except for
- GLPK output (spkg-configure should really reject a libglpk that talks too much) - it makes it hard to see actual failures
- and numerical failures in `src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx`, `src/sage/finance/time_series.pyx`, and `src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_homset.py` as reported in #29013

```
sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/matrix2.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/finance/time_series.pyx  # 5 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/affine/affine_homset.py  # 1 doctest failed

after this fix, it builds and passes most tests on Gentoo (some errors related to cryptominisat that I had installed, and it probably got broken in some way)

I see (on a system where cryptominisat package works) that it is one of few packages that get installed without a sub-directory named the same as package in site-packages:

```
sage: import pycryptosat
sage: print(pycryptosat.__file__)
/home/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pycryptosat.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
sage: import numpy
sage: print(numpy.__file__)
/home/scratch2/dimpase/sage/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py
```

Not sure whether this is a bug on the package, or a bug in this branch.
On this branch I see (with `local=SAGE_LOCAL`)

```
$ ls local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/*
local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pycryptosat-0.2.0-py3.7.egg-info  local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pycryptosat.cpython-37m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```
So it seems that this branch does not pick up anything from that location.

This amounts to trying to upgrade python3's `venv` to something like a conda environment. This is what I avoid in #29013 on purpose - the `venv` is only used in a clean, documented way, using the documented tools.

writing `pyvenv.cfg` by hand is bound to be broken at some point, as it's an implementation detail of venv.
The correct interface to `venv` is to use `venv`, I think.

It's documented both in the documentation for the `venv` module and the `site` module.  If you really want to avoid writing it by hand the `venv` module includes code for that as well.  This (with the *system* Python 3) is effectively the same (albeit more opaque).  From within SAGE_ROOT, but without the sage environment activated:\n\n```\n$ python3 -c 'import venv; b = venv.EnvBuilder(); c = b.ensure_directories(\"local\"); b.create_configuration(c)'\n$ cat local/pyvenv.cfg\nhome = /usr/bin\ninclude-system-site-packages = false\nversion = 3.6.8\n```\n\nbut I think even that's overkill for now.",

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A38):
> writing `pyvenv.cfg` by hand is bound to be broken at some point, as it's an implementation detail of venv.
> The correct interface to `venv` is to use `venv`, I think.

That's not true.  It's documented both in the documentation for the `venv` module and the `site` module.  If you really want to avoid writing it by hand the `venv` module includes code for that as well.  This (with the *system* Python 3) is effectively the same (albeit more opaque).  From within SAGE_ROOT, but without the sage environment activated:

```
$ python3 -c 'import venv; b = venv.EnvBuilder(); c = b.ensure_directories("local"); b.create_configuration(c)'
$ cat local/pyvenv.cfg
home = /usr/bin
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.6.8
```

but I think even that's overkill for now.

But why do you need to make a virtualenv for that?  Why not run the system python directly?

On this ticket, the system python is not used directly but rather in a venv without site-packages.
Therefore the correct test is to test whether the module will be available in a venv.

Wait, I misunderstood what you wrote at first.  I know why it uses a virtualenv.  What I don't get is why you need to make a venv to test features of the system python when you can just call the system python directly here?

Testing with the attached Dockerfile on ubuntu bionic.

module and distutils checking seems to work correctly.

Got stuck at `scipy` install.

Looks like `scipy` would need a sitecfg as well so that it finds BLAS. It's strange that we build numpy with providing `site.cfg` (which we just had to correct in #29025), but `scipy` without `site.cfg`.

I wonder about rationale for disabling system's `site-packages`.
Is this the only way to install custom versions of packages in venv (which can conflict with ones is system's `site-packages`)?

It’s strictly for making this ticket easier because I don’t have to worry about getting the correct versions of all Python packages.
See #29023 for the next step - let’s discuss any issues regarding use of system site packages there.

I agree here, it's much simpler for now to focus on using a "bare" Python as much as possible.  I think detecting and using system Python packages *is* where we want to go, but it can get a bit hairier...

 Do not install python3 if a sufficiently new version is available in `$PATH`. This could be a system python3, or the python3 from within a venv.
 
-Via #29013, we install all of our own Python packages into a separate venv.
+As suggested in #29032, we make $SAGE_LOCAL a venv (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) over the system python3 -- if a suitable system python3 is found -- by using the `venv.EnvBuilder` API. 
 
-The venv does not include the system site-packages; we keep that task for the follow-up ticket #29023.
+This is done by the new script `build/bin/sage-venv`, which we use both during `configure` (to make sure that we select a system python3 for which venvs work correctly) and during `make`.
+
+The venv does not include the system site-packages: We continue to install all Python packages into our venv using the existing build infrastructure. We keep the task of using system site-packages for the follow-up ticket #29023.

Hello everyone,

When trying to upgrade to 9.1.rc5, I'm seeing an issue that I suspect could be a side effect of this ticket.

For some reason my `sage/local/bin/python3.7` was a symlink to the system python binary. Sage decided it wanted to install its own python-3.7.3.p1, but that failed with a permission error on the symlink. After deleting the symlink, python builds and installs correctly. (I let the logs be overwritten, so I won't be able to provide much details — sorry.)

The overall Sage build still fails with an error about six not being found while building setuptools that I haven't yet investigated.

if you switch to py3 from py2, you probably need to run `./configure --with-python=3`

it is not clear what version you were on, but the changes to the build system were very substantial, so ymmv.

Yes, this is a known limitation. I have created #29708 (Fix switching between --with-system-python3 and --without-system-python3) for it. We shall fix it in 9.2.
