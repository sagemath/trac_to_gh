There are a few mistakes one can easily make, when creating a CombinatorialPolyhedron from a list of facets or an incidence matrix. It would be nice to give warnings/error messages about them. Such mistakes can be:

- Not specifying the nr of lines in an unbounded Polyhedron (one knows it is the case, when the vertices in their facet reprsentation are a subset from each other).
- Giving one `facet` that is actually a list of all vertices.
- Giving an incompatible list of names for vertices and/or facets (maybe too long or too short).
- Checking the facets for inclusions.

Maybe it makes sense to initialize the CombinatorialPolyehdron in C and then do any error checking in terms of inclusion tests. Then a correct input will still be about the same speed and an incorrect input slower.

One could give a warning as "The Polyhedron appears to be unbounded, assuming n number of lines".
