Using latest code from both https://github.com/igraph/igraph.git and https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph.git  I get

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(1000, .01)
sage: I = G.igraph_graph()

1.27 ms ± 13.4 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

For me the files are the same.

I tried on a linux computer and it's working well. I can use the pagerank method of igraph.

For me this patch is good to go. Should we update the ticket title and description before setting it to positive review?

How about we add a doctest with pagenumber computation?

Should we really? We had those conversations in the last few weeks. Do we really want to add tests to sage about bugs in upstream packages? No, if anything the test belongs to the upstream package. This is a case in point and adding a test to sage is scope creep.

For what it's worth, with this branch I get two failures when I do `sage -f -c igraph` on OS X Mojave:

```

The previous version of `igraph` failed two other (?) tests, so I don't think the new failures should necessarily be an obstacle for a positive review. Failures from old version:

```
