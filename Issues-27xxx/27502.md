Using latest code from both https://github.com/igraph/igraph.git and https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph.git  I get

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomGNP(1000, .01)
sage: I = G.igraph_graph()
sage: %timeit I.pagerank()
1.27 ms ± 13.4 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```
So upstream have fixed some bugs already

Thank you.

I add to rename file https://github.com/dimpase/igraph/releases/download/0.7.1999/igraph-0.7.1999.1.tar.gz to https://github.com/dimpase/igraph/releases/download/0.7.1999/igraph-0.7.1999.tar.gz (so `.1.tar.gz` -> `.tar.gz`)

Then everything is working well and I can do

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: I = G.igraph_graph()
sage: I.pagerank()
[0.09999999999999999,
 0.09999999999999999,

For what it's worth, with this branch I get two failures when I do `sage -f -c igraph` on OS X Mojave:

```
...

The previous version of `igraph` failed two other (?) tests, so I don't think the new failures should necessarily be an obstacle for a positive review. Failures from old version:
