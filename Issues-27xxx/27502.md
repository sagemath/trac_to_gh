<a id='comment:17'></a>Thank you.

I add to rename file https://github.com/dimpase/igraph/releases/download/0.7.1999/igraph-0.7.1999.1.tar.gz to https://github.com/dimpase/igraph/releases/download/0.7.1999/igraph-0.7.1999.tar.gz (so `.1.tar.gz` -> `.tar.gz`)

Then everything is working well and I can do

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: I = G.igraph_graph()
sage: I.pagerank()
[0.09999999999999999,
 0.09999999999999999,
 0.10000000000000002,
 0.10000000000000002,
 0.1,
 0.1,
 0.1,
 0.09999999999999999,
 0.1,
 0.09999999999999999]
```

Someone should double check on linux.
