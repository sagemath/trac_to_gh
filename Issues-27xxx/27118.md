sgae 8.7.beta0 with `gap_packages` installed. Reinstalling `gap_packages` does not help.

I cannot reproduce (yet) this on other systems, this just happens with one Sage installation.

How about reinstalling `gap` and `gap_packages`? 


(and making sure old GAP is purged from SAGE_LOCAL - this is supposed to be automatic, but...)

If this is required, then that's a bug.
