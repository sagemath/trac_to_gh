In order to finish #22029, we need one patch to Pynac, accepted upstream at 
https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/339

This affects only 2 doctests in all of Sage, so it's quite innocent.

Yes in an ideal world we want and wait for the next release and we can make that request but sage is a bit of a fast conveyor belt at times :)

Sage is the main consumer of pynac, but Sage is not pynac.

No. That might actually be a reason not to make a new release: we just had an upgrade (#26995) and the PR for this ticket is the only change to master since then.

As I mentioned in the ticket description, this patch affects only 2 doctests in Sage which would otherwise break with #22029.

You could also not add the patch and live with 2 additional doctest failures.

I think that #22029 is too important to be held back by a Pynac release.

Debian seems to think otherwise, but I'm actually glad that you don't want any test failures. OK, but then you could still add a patch to remove/disable those 2 tests.

It's a ticket which makes far-reaching changing and I'm worried about regressions against it.

Alright, I haven't looked into the details and don't know how important it is. Patching pynac is not a terribly big deal for me (especially since sage is its *only* consumer in nixpkgs). So I'm mostly arguing out of principle, since I'm trying to change the "just patch" attitude.
