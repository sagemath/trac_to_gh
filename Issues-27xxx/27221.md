In order to finish #22029, we need one patch to Pynac, accepted upstream at 
https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/339

This affects only 2 doctests in all of Sage, so it's quite innocent.

Yes in an ideal world we want and wait for the next release and we can make that request but sage is a bit of a fast conveyor belt at times :)

No. That might actually be a reason not to make a new release: we just had an upgrade (#26995) and the PR for this ticket is the only change to master since then.

As I mentioned in the ticket description, this patch affects only 2 doctests in Sage which would otherwise break with #22029.

I think that #22029 is too important to be held back by a Pynac release.

I couldn't, any test failures fail the build.

Debian seems to think otherwise, but I'm actually glad that you don't want any test failures. OK, but then you could still add a patch to remove/disable those 2 tests.

It's a ticket which makes far-reaching changing and I'm worried about regressions against it.

Patching pynac is not a terribly big deal for me (especially since sage is its *only* consumer in nixpkgs). So I'm mostly arguing out of principle, since I'm trying to change the \"just patch\" attitude.\n\nHaving expressed my opinion about this (I'm still not convinced patching is worth it here, waiting for a new pynac release would probably only introduce a couple of days delay), I won't argue any further.",

Debian is in a somewhat more difficult position, with their limited control of the environment sage executes in and additional bureaucracy. Still, if you ask me they would be better off explicitly marking known failures instead of just picking some threshold of acceptable test failures. This doesn't really fit into this ticket though, if anyone wants to continue that discussion we can do that on sage-packaging :)

(One more thing I'm pretty excited about: Nix is now [available in debian](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/nix_2.2.1-2.html))

Alright, I haven't looked into the details and don't know how important it is. Patching pynac is not a terribly big deal for me (especially since sage is its *only* consumer in nixpkgs). So I'm mostly arguing out of principle, since I'm trying to change the "just patch" attitude.

Having expressed my opinion about this (I'm still not convinced patching is worth it here, waiting for a new pynac release would probably only introduce a couple of days delay), I won't argue any further.
