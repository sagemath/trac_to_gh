1. Currently it uses python heap which can be evolved to use cython heap.
2. Small bug fix


```

   sage: eg1 = DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[4], 2:[3,4], 4:[5], 5:[6]})

   sage: for (u,v) in eg1.edges(labels=None):

   ....:    eg1.set_edge_label(u,v,1)

   eg1.distance(0,5,by_weight=true)

```


   3
   is correct but 

```
   sage: eg1 = DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[4], 2:[3,4], 4:[5],5:[6]},multiedges=True)

   sage: for (u,v) in eg1.edges(labels=None):

   ....:    eg1.set_edge_label(u,v,1)

   eg1.distance(0,5,by_weight=true)
```


```
-> 2246                heappush(queue, (distance + edge_label, side, v,

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
```




It throws an error due to edge_label being a list for multiedges.

I am not sure what do you mean by unifying the usage of weights in the graph module. As per my understanding:

Regarding labels and weight functions , these are the two options we have in various functions. The weighted graphs seem to have applications mainly in case of computing distance measure between the nodes. And these methods have suitable parameters in which they either ask for the weight function to be specified by the user or they take the edge labels into account.

I have used c++ stl template priority_queue(by default available in cython) in my code and also included 

# distutils: language=c++ 

on the top of the c_graph.pyx file.
 
I guess it seems to be converting it into c file not cpp file causing a problem. I guess somewhere like in setup.py we have to use g++ instead of gcc.

Any help on how to proceed?

I disagree with the change you made for multigraph. `weight_function` is defined as a function that inputs an edge `(u, v, l)` and outputs its weight.

We could do for instance:

```
v_obj = self.vertex_label(v)
w_obj = self.vertex_label(w)
if side == -1:
    v_obj, w_obj = w_obj, v_obj
if self.allows_multiple_edges():
    edge_label = min(weight_function((v_obj, w_obj, l)) for l in self.get_edge_label(v_obj, w_obj))
else:
    edge_label = weight_function((v_obj, w_obj, self.get_edge_label(v_obj, w_obj)))
```


I'm no expert in c++, but why using priority queue instead of a heap ?

*I'm no expert in c++, but why using priority queue instead of a heap ?* 

Priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that its first element is always the greatest of the elements it contains, according to some strict weak ordering criterion.
This context is similar to a heap, where elements can be inserted at any moment, and only the max heap element can be retrieved (the one at the top in the priority queue). In fact in C++ STL we have priority_queue as a heap but in python name given is heapq. 

In C++ priority_queue are a part of standard template library and works in the same way as a heap. It has the complexity of push and pop operations as logn.
