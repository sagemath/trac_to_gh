1. Currently it uses python heap which can be evolved to use cython heap.
2. Small bug fix


```

   sage: eg1 = DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[4], 2:[3,4], 4:[5], 5:[6]})

   sage: for (u,v) in eg1.edges(labels=None):

   ....:    eg1.set_edge_label(u,v,1)

   eg1.distance(0,5,by_weight=true)

```


   3
   is correct but 

```
   sage: eg1 = DiGraph({0:[1,2], 1:[4], 2:[3,4], 4:[5],5:[6]},multiedges=True)

   sage: for (u,v) in eg1.edges(labels=None):

   ....:    eg1.set_edge_label(u,v,1)

   eg1.distance(0,5,by_weight=true)
```


```
-> 2246                heappush(queue, (distance + edge_label, side, v,

TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'
```




It throws an error due to edge_label being a list for multiedges.

I guess wrt the current ticket the bug can be overcome by using has_multiple_edges() function and taking the smallest edge weight for computing the shortest distances in case of multiedges.

I am not sure what do you mean by unifying the usage of weights in the graph module. As per my understanding:

Regarding labels and weight functions , these are the two options we have in various functions. The weighted graphs seem to have applications mainly in case of computing distance measure between the nodes. And these methods have suitable parameters in which they either ask for the weight function to be specified by the user or they take the edge labels into account. We also have _check_weight_function() to check inconsistencies in weighting. I guess all methods relating to weighted graph usage use these functions. So does unifying means to drop the labels option and strictly assigning weights instead of label field or to include a function to check consistencies of weighted edges but for that we already have _check_weight_function().

```

I have used c++ stl template priority_queue(by default available in cython) in my code and also included 

\# distutils: language=c++ 

on the top of the c_graph.pyx file.
 
I guess it seems to be converting it into c file not cpp file causing a problem. I guess somewhere like in setup.py we have to use g++ instead of gcc.

Any help on how to proceed?

<a id='comment:16'>Comment 16:</a>
I disagree with the change you made for multigraph. `weight_function` is defined as a function that inputs an edge `(u, v, l)` and outputs its weight.

We could do for instance:

```
v_obj = self.vertex_label(v)
w_obj = self.vertex_label(w)
if side == -1:
    v_obj, w_obj = w_obj, v_obj
if self.allows_multiple_edges():
    edge_label = min(weight_function((v_obj, w_obj, l)) for l in self.get_edge_label(v_obj, w_obj))
else:
    edge_label = weight_function((v_obj, w_obj, self.get_edge_label(v_obj, w_obj)))
```


I'm no expert in c++, but why using priority queue instead of a heap ?

<a id='comment:19'>Comment 19:</a>
* `weight_function` returns `e[2]` with the default weight function (check input parameter of the method). But a method like `shortest_path` will give a weight function to `bidirectional_dijkstra`, and that function can be defined by a user.

  => Consequently, the change made is necessary for multigraphs.

* I'm fine using `priority_queue`. I was just asking if better heap data structures where available. 

  Could you just add a comment in the code explaining why you use `-distance` and `-(distance + edge_label)`. It's just to easy the maintainability of the code.
