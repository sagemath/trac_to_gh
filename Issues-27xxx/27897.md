There is some weird undesirable "holding" going on:

```
sage: sqrt(abs(1+I)^2 + 14)
sqrt(16)
```

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

It looks like there is some double wrapping happening here:

```
sage: (1+I).pyobject().parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: abs(1+I).pyobject().parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: (abs(1+I)^2).pyobject().parent()
Symbolic Ring
```
here things seem to be still reasonable. However, this last result is "double wrapped":

```
sage: (abs(1+I)^2).pyobject().pyobject().parent()
Rational Field
```
and it looks like that's too deep for `sqrt` to see through. It doesn't happen for this case:

```
sage: (abs(sqrt(2))^2).pyobject().parent()
Integer Ring
```

---
that could be a red herring, though:

```
sage: b=(1+I)*(1-I)+14
sage: b.pyobject().parent() #this is appropriate
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
sage: sqrt(b)
sqrt(16)
sage: sqrt(b.pyobject())
4
```
It means that

```
sage: a=sqrt(abs((1+I))^2+14)
sage: b=sqrt(norm(1+I)+14)
```
both lead to unexpectedly "held" expressions, but with different structures:

```
sage: a.operands()[0].pyobject().parent()
Symbolic Ring
sage: a.operands()[0].pyobject().pyobject().parent()
Rational Field
sage: b.operands()[0].pyobject().parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
```
where

```
sage: b.operands()[0].pyobject().sqrt()
4
```
so perhaps both problems are solved if `sqrt` on an `SR` element would look a little deeper.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I think the problem is gone:

```
sage: sqrt(abs(1+I)^2 + 14)                                                  
4
```
This is with 9.3b6 on MacOS 10.15.7, but I get `sqrt(16)` with 9.2 on `CoCalc`, so something seems to have changed since then.

The PR adds a doctest. If the patchbots turn green, then I think we can close this ticket.
