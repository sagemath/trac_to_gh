<div id="comment:0"></div>

Inside `$SAGE_ROOT`, I see a file like

```
src/build/cythonized/build/cythonized/sage/libs/eclib/wrap.cpp
```
The duplication of `build/cythonized` is not how it's supposed to be.

There is also an issue with dependency checking: when `src/sage/libs/eclib/wrap.cpp` is edited and Sage is rebuilt, the new contents of that file are not taken into account.

This started with #27040, which accidentally removed the top-level source directory `SAGE_SRC` from the include directories. This way, the include was only found in the build directory, confusing Cython.

No, it's #27040, and in particular, the directories are created when `cythonize` is run in `sage_build_cython.run`. The dependencies for the elements in `module_list` are wrong: before #27040, I see (among other things):

```
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/local/include/python2.7/pythread.h
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/cpython/cython_metaclass.h
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/libs/ntl/ntlwrap.h
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/src/sage/libs/ntl/ntlwrap_impl.h
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/src/setup.py
```
while after #27040, I see

```
/path/to/SAGE_ROOT/local/include/python2.7/pythread.h
build/cythonized/sage/cpython/cython_metaclass.h
build/cythonized/sage/libs/ntl/ntlwrap.h
build/cythonized/sage/libs/ntl/ntlwrap_impl.h
build/cythonized/setup.py
```
(I put a print statement in the `Cython.Build.Dependencies.cythonize` function: after `module_list, module_metadata = create_extension_list(...`, I added

```
    for m in module_list:
        for dep in m.depends:
            print(dep)
```
)
Does that clarify anything?

Just to be clear, this is only an oddity when building in source, right?  Does it actually *break* anything?  You mentioned in the ticket something about it breaking dependency checking when modifying some files.  Did this fix it?

What do you mean with "building in source"?

First: with this branch, the `build/cythonized/build/` directory is not created.

Second: without this branch (and is this what Erik was asking?), if I use `./configure --prefix=/path/to/somewhere/else`, then `build/cythonized/build` is still created in `SAGE_ROOT/src`.
