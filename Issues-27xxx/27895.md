This ticket implements new options `xrange`/`yrange` for `matrix_plot` which allow to specify the rectangle in which to draw a matrix.

For example the following can be used to draw the matrix in [0,1]×[0,1] instead of the default [-0.5,4.5]×[-0.5,4.5].

```
sage: matrix_plot(identity_matrix(5), xrange=(0, 1), yrange=(0, 1))
```

Note that there is a very old ticket #2189 attempting to implement the same, among other things, but it is too old to merge.

Depends on #27891

<a id='comment:6'>**Comment 6:**</a>
I renamed the `extent` option to `xrange`/`yrange` because this is more consistent with the existing API such as in `density_plot` and `contour_plot`.

As graphics arrays now work correctly since #27865 got merged, testing this became considerably easier. For example, you can check that the various combinations of options work as intended using:

```
m = identity_matrix(5); m[1,0] = 2
arr = [matrix_plot(matrix(m, sparse=s), xrange=x, yrange=y, flip_y=f)
       for s in [False, True]
       for f in [True, False]
       for x in [(-2,1), None]
       for y in [(-pi,-1), None]]
graphics_array(arr, ncols=4).show(figsize=10)
```
Be sure to merge one of the latest betas for that.

There is a slight change in behavior for the graphics primitive `MatrixPlot`. The parameters `xrange`/`yrange` now behave like those of `matrix_plot`, defining the bounding box in which to draw a matrix. Previously, they could be used to obtain a subimage of a matrix plot (with an offset of 0.5), although this was not really documented well. Being a graphics primitive, `MatrixPlot` seems to be intended for internal use only, so I think this change is fine and arguably more useful. The old behavior can still be obtained by using the keywords `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`.
