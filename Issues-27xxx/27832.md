Duality for planar graphs is not only between vertices and faces but between edges and edges. This change allows a user to keep track of a collection of edges in a graph and its dual more easily.

`planar_dual()` was a slick almost-one-liner before, using a lambda function for the edges, but unfortunately constructing a graph that way doesn't allow edge labels. Changing the graph constructor is not a design decision I'm ready to tackle so updating this method seems like the best option.

The test I've added highlights how the edges of a facial cycle in a planar graph become a vertex bond in the dual.

The commit I made looks like it modified a lot of methods, but it just took some lines filled with only spaces and replaced them with blank lines. I hope that's okay. I can revert it or make other idiomatic changes if desired.

When you do `e = e.pop()`, we have a single edge not only not because `self is simple`, but also because we consider 3-connected graphs only. 
For instance, this method will raise an error if the graph is a cycle, or for any graph obtained by subdividing the edges of a 3-connected planar graph. In both cases we would get several edges in the set `e`.

May be you should clarify this in the code.
