This sorting was introduced in #25426 to fix a problem with `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`. Since sorting vertices of graphs is not possible in general, that needs to be reverted.

In fact, the problem was not with bliss but with invalid assumptions made in the method `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`.

So this ticket reverts the fix for #25426 and replaces it by a correct fix.

I agree that we should not sort vertices in bliss, but there is also something to do in `PermutationGroup**`. Why should `domain` be sorted ? Why can we call `PermutationGroup` with non-integer vertices/domain ?

An expert in `PermutationGroup` is certainly needed here.

In which sense **cannot be sorted** ? At least these are hashable objects, so these are sortable according to their hashs, aren't they?

The problem is really in the `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns` method itself. When reverting #25426, the computed graph automorphism is correct. It's just that the conversion of that to an automorphism of the matrix goes wrong.

That documentation is just wrong... even the examples in that file have other domains. I decided that remove that piece of documentation: having wrong documentation is worse than no documentation at all.

In matrix2 one sees

```
         B = self.as_bipartite_graph()
         nrows = self.nrows()
         ncols = self.ncols()
-        parts = [list(range(1, nrows + 1)),
-                 list(range(nrows + 1, nrows + ncols + 1))]
-        A = B.automorphism_group(partition=parts, edge_labels=True)
+        A = B.automorphism_group(edge_labels=True)
```

I don't understand why this is mathematically correct. With this change, A may end up bigger than before. E.g. imagine B being symmetric and having all entries 1, then the new way will give an extra automorphism flipping row and columns.

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A12):

No, that's checked in the code after that:

```
if p(1) <= nrows: # Check that rows are mapped to rows
```

OK, it did not cross my mind that in the original code there was a condition which was identically true :-)

All in all, this function is an example of horribly non-efficient computation - it should return an iterator, or a generating set for the group in question, not a list of permutations.
