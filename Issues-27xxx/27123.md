This sorting was introduced in #25426 to fix a problem with `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`. Since sorting vertices of graphs is not possible in general, that needs to be reverted.

In fact, the problem was not with bliss but with invalid assumptions made in the method `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`.

So this ticket reverts the fix for #25426 and replaces it by a correct fix.

I had a quick look at `PermutationGroup` (documentation is incomplete) and then at `PermutationGroup_generic`... According to the documentation, parameter `domain` must be a sorted list of integer, but in bliss `automorphism_group()` we don't ensure that vertices are integers.

I agree that we should not sort vertices in bliss, but there is also something to do in `PermutationGroup**`. Why should `domain` be sorted ? Why can we call `PermutationGroup` with non-integer vertices/domain ?

An expert in `PermutationGroup` is certainly needed here.

In which sense **cannot be sorted** ? At least these are hashable objects, so these are sortable according to their hashs, aren't they?

The problem is really in the `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns` method itself. When reverting #25426, the computed graph automorphism is correct. It's just that the conversion of that to an automorphism of the matrix goes wrong.

That documentation is just wrong... even the examples in that file have other domains. I decided that remove that piece of documentation: having wrong documentation is worse than no documentation at all.
