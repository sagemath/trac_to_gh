This sorting was introduced in #25426 to fix a problem with `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`. Since sorting vertices of graphs is not possible in general, that needs to be reverted.

In fact, the problem was not with bliss but with invalid assumptions made in the method `automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns`.

So this ticket reverts the fix for #25426 and replaces it by a correct fix.

I agree that we should not sort vertices in bliss, but there is also something to do in `PermutationGroup**`. Why should `domain` be sorted ? Why can we call `PermutationGroup` with non-integer vertices/domain ?

An expert in `PermutationGroup` is certainly needed here.
