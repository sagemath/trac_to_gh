I'm curious, is it bad to use `I` for a variable? Too easy to confuse with the number 1?

```diff
-            I = IntegerRange(Integer(0),Integer(maxdim+1))
+            Ir = IntegerRange(Integer(0), Integer(maxdim + 1))
```
Here is one more change. If you approve, positive review.

* The change of variable names for something longer and more explicit is suggested by pycodestyle. I do not quite agree that it is always useful to do that. Usually, I would avoid it, but sometimes I make it nevertheless.

* Your commit is ok, you can set to positive.
