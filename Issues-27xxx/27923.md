Since #19917, tab completion on `libgap` returns a fixed list. As noted there, new global functions and objects introduced when loading packages remain therefore hidden. Now that loading packages in libgap is much better supported, this is really becoming an issue.

Proposal, after discussion with GAP devs: use the same implementation as in the plain `gap` interface (namely ask GAP for the list of global names), without a cache.

Pros:
- Principle of less surprise: keep plain GAP, Sage's `gap` and Sage's `libgap` consistent;
- Follow the design decisions of GAP to take advantage of their expertise;
- Supports loading packages and advertising their content (this support was postponed to a later ticket in #19917);
- No need any more to maintain in Sage a list of "important" GAP functions.
- With libgap, fetching the list of global GAP symbols is quasi instantaneous:

  ```
  sage: %time a = [str(x) for x in libgap.NamesSystemGVars()]
  CPU times: user 21.2 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 21.2 ms
  Wall time: 20.9 ms
  ```
  Hence the implementation is simple; we need not worry about caching, invalidating the cache upon loading packages, ...

Con:
- This makes for a larger tab completion list

What I'd like to understand whether with this approach there is a performance hit if one
uses `libgap.Blah` calls in a loop.
Calling (lib)GAP inside a loop to determine the function to call would quickly become very slow.

This ticket is only about tab completion (VIA `dir(self)`), and is orthogonal to attribute access (via `__getattr__`). So this should have no influence whatsoever on `libgap.Blah` calls.

#27911 is about attribute access `libgap.xxx` whenever xxx exists in GAP. This one is about what should appear in the tab-completion on libgap. Of course some level of consistency is good, but other than this they are independent issues.

Just repeating my comment from #27911, this tends to cough up a lot of private / undocumented functions in GAP that necessarily are in the public GAP namespace but users aren't supposed to access.

The current implementation uses IsDocumentedWord to only return documented symbols. Which also is slow as molasses since it grinds through the documentation, so it needs to be cached.

On the plus side, gap itself tab-completes over everything so at least we'd match that bug/misfeature/feature (pick your choice). So I'm fine with changing it...

Thanks Volker for the feedback!

Agreed, displaying private functions is on the misfeature side. Hopefully that will eventually get fixed on the GAP side.

If no one objects I'll make libgap's completion consistent with GAP's later this week or during Cernay.

I agree with Volker that it's a shame that GAP's global namespace is so overloaded, but that's a (mis)feature of GAP that it doesn't ultimately help us to fight against.

Perhaps as a policy, when using GAP code internally in Sage only those functions for which `IsDocumentedWord` is true should be used. Not sure if there's a great way to enforce that except by checking manually.
