1. Fix the following bug.

```
sage: C = designs.best_known_covering_design_from_LJCR(7, 3, 2)

    525     if verbose:
    526         print("Looking up the bounds at %s" % url)

    528         s = bytes_to_str(f.read())
    529     if 'covering not in database' in s:  # not found

AttributeError: addinfourl instance has no attribute '__exit__'
```
Found by Sebastien Labbé see #26592

The root cause is that the object returned by `urlopen` doesn't have an `__exit__` method in python2 and therefore it can not be used with a `with ... as ...` syntax.

2. Fix a doctest error in design_catalog.py:


```

Is this a solution:

```
from six.moves.urllib.request import urlopen
```
? This is what I used in #25535.

No because it is already used in `covering_design.py`.
In #25535 you use `with ... as` with a file objet, this works nicely.
