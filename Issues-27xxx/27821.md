1. Fix the following bug.

AttributeError: addinfourl instance has no attribute '__exit__'
```
Found by Sebastien Labbé see #26592

The root cause is that the object returned by `urlopen` doesn't have an `__exit__` method in python2 and therefore it can not be used with a `with ... as ...` syntax.

2. Fix a doctest error in design_catalog.py:


```

Is this a solution:

```
from six.moves.urllib.request import urlopen
```
? This is what I used in #25535.

No because it is already used in `covering_design.py`.
In #25535 you use `with ... as` with a file objet, this works nicely.

As mentionned [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/boCyh_RM9WU/Y8EyeFWLAgAJ), two files were having the same issue. We are almost there.

There is still one small issue:

```
$ sage -tp --long --optional=sage,optional,external src/sage/combinat/designs/covering_design.py  src/sage/combinat/designs/design_catalog.py
