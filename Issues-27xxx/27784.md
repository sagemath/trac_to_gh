Characteristic classes on differentiable vector bundles.

**Features**

- characteristic classes on differentiable manifolds using the Chern-Weil homomorphism
- class `BundleConnection` introduced with rudimentary methods
- each characteristic class carries a dictionary with bundle connection as keys and mixed forms as values in order to simulate the cohomology equivalence

**Planned sometime**

- transgression forms

I know, you are really busy right now, Eric. However, this ticket is the essence and foundation of my master thesis and I'd highly appreciate at least a short look whether the structure is okay.

Travis, could you take a short look, too?

Details can be changed later, but the rough structure should be fine before I start writing my thesis.

Thank you both! I really appreciate your effort so far. :)

Here are my comments (mostly on the technical details):

Don't feel the strict need to adhere to PEP8 when it degrades readability. In particular, don't have a line break here:

```diff
-from sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle\
-                                               import DifferentiableVectorBundle
+from sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle import DifferentiableVectorBundle
```
and similarly here

```
            sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.bundle_connection import \
                                                                BundleConnection
```
In contrast, you can break `.. MATH::` lines.

Remove the period/full-stop at the end here:

```
    - ``latex_name`` -- (default: ``None``) LaTeX symbol to denote the bundle
      connection; if ``None``, it is set to ``name``.
```

I don't see the point of this note:

```
    .. NOTE::

        Notice that this is a *very* rudimentary form of bundle connections.
        A more detailed implementation is devoted to :trac:`28640`.
```
The only people who will care are developers, it is irrelevant to the use of this class, and it makes it come across as less polished.

The block after `They certainly obey the structure equation::` is over-indented.

A general comment (not something you need to address here, but I noticed it now): we should have a little mix-in class for `_latex_name` objects (or perhaps more generally `NamedObject`) so we don't have so much repeated boilerplate code.

Instead of `_hash_value`, the more standard naming is `_hash`.

Error messages should follow the general Python convention:

```diff
-raise ValueError("A frame must be provided!")
+raise ValueError("a frame must be provided")
```

Is this relevant? `# TODO: Compute transformations` Should it instead raise a `NotImplementedError`?

Is there some way we can automate this?

```
        .. WARNING::

            If the connection has already forms in other frames, it is the
            user's responsibility to make sure that the 1-forms to be added
            are consistent with them.
```

```diff
-computation in SAGE.
+computation in Sage.
```
Although really I would suggest just deleting that sentence (you already are using Sage and such an  internal working, if you insist on including it, should be in an `ALGORITHM:` section).

I generally dislike these things:

```
Class Documentation
-------------------
```
They don't convey any information and just are a bit of a distraction IMO.

`_get_predefined_class` is not a static method (it is just a separate function). Also <code>\`arg\`</code> -> <code>\`\`arg\`\`</code>

This should just be an `if-else` statement:

```python
    c_dict = {}
    c_dict['ChernChar'] = ('complex', 'additive', 'ch', r'\mathrm{ch}', x.exp())
    c_dict['Todd'] = ('complex', 'additive', 'Td', r'\mathrm{Td}',
                      x / (1 - (-x).exp()))
    c_dict['Chern'] = ('complex', 'multiplicative', 'c', 'c', 1 + x)
    c_dict['Pontryagin'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'p', 'p', 1 + x)
    c_dict['AHat'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'A^', r'\hat{A}',
                      x.sqrt() / (2 * (x.sqrt() / 2).sinh()))
    c_dict['Hirzebruch'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'L', 'L',
                            (x.sqrt() / x.sqrt().tanh()))
    c_dict['Euler'] = ('real', 'Pfaffian', 'e', 'e', x)
    # Get class from arg
    try:
        res = c_dict[arg]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("the characteristic class '{}' is ".format(arg) +
                         "not predefined yet.")
```
unless you were hoping to cache `c_dict`, but I don't see the utility in that as this should not be a bottleneck.

Do not abbreviate class names and `UniqueRepresentation` is better being first in the MRO:

```diff
-class CharClass(SageObject, UniqueRepresentation):
+class CharacteristicClass(UniqueRepresentation, SageObject):
```
IMO, generally you should avoid abbreviated names for inputs/function names/etc. for the main implementation (although it is okay to have an abbreviated alias). (For another example, `get_form(self, con, cmatrices=None):` and use `connection` instead of `con` and `def char_class` to `def characteristic_class`) This better self-documents the code and can make things more discoverable with tab completion. For example, I might type `.charact<tab>` and then be surprised that nothing comes up.

In `_get_coeff_list`, there is no need for the `coef` variable (just return the result).
Also

```diff
-(self._base_space._dim / 2).floor()
+self._base_space._dim // 2
```
and make `from sage.symbolic.ring import SR` at the top-level.

```diff
-- ``cmatrix`` curvature matrix
+- ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
```

I gave a quik look. It looks nice!
Thanks for having taken into account Travis' remarks. I fully agree with them. 
Here a few remarks from my side: 

- There is a failed doctest:

```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/char_class.py", line 685, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.char_class.CharacteristicClass.get_form
Failed example:
    ch_form.display()
Expected:
    ch(E, nabla^E) = ch_0(E, nabla^E) + zero + ch_1(E, nabla^E)
Got:
    ch(E, nabla^E) = ch_0.0(E, nabla^E) + zero + ch_1.0(E, nabla^E)
```
- There are two warnings when generating the documentation:

```
[manifolds] <unknown>:2566: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \c
[manifolds] <unknown>:2565: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \c
```
- in the OUTPUT section of `BundleConnection.add_connection_form()`, a back quote is missing:

```diff
- connection 1-form `\omega^i_j in the given frame, as an instance of
+ connection 1-form `\omega^i_j` in the given frame, as an instance of
```
- in the introduction to characteristic classes, `N` is not defined in the sentence

```
for any continuous map `f: M \to N`
```
- in the doctest example of `in DifferentiableVectorBundle.characteristic_class()`:

```diff
- sage: g = M.metric('g')
+ sage: g = M.metric()
```
(since `M` has been defined a Lorentzian manifold, `g` has already been initialized, with the name 'g')

That's strange...I don't get this error. Travis?

The first one has nothing to do with the changes in this ticket.

From my side, I think we are almost done here. Two last remarks:
- in the introduction to characteristic classes, `\mathfrak{g}` is not defined
- could the file `char_class.py` be renamed `characteristic_class.py`? (this would improve the readability of the directory `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable` and would match with the name of the class `CharacteristicClass`)
