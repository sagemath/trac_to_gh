Characteristic classes on differentiable vector bundles.

**Features**

- characteristic classes on differentiable manifolds using the Chern-Weil homomorphism
- class `BundleConnection` introduced with rudimentary methods
- each characteristic class carries a dictionary with bundle connection as keys and mixed forms as values in order to simulate the cohomology equivalence

**Planned sometime**

- transgression forms

I know, you are really busy right now, Eric. However, this ticket is the essence and foundation of my master thesis and I'd highly appreciate at least a short look whether the structure is okay.

Travis, could you take a short look, too?

Details can be changed later, but the rough structure should be fine before I start writing my thesis.

Thank you both! I really appreciate your effort so far. :)

<a id='comment:25'></a>
Here are my comments (mostly on the technical details):

Don't feel the strict need to adhere to PEP8 when it degrades readability. In particular, don't have a line break here:

```diff
-from sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle\
-                                               import DifferentiableVectorBundle
+from sage.manifolds.differentiable.vector_bundle import DifferentiableVectorBundle
```
and similarly here

```
            sage: from sage.manifolds.differentiable.bundle_connection import \
                                                                BundleConnection
```
In contrast, you can break `.. MATH::` lines.

Remove the period/full-stop at the end here:

```
    - ``latex_name`` -- (default: ``None``) LaTeX symbol to denote the bundle
      connection; if ``None``, it is set to ``name``.
```

I don't see the point of this note:

```
    .. NOTE::

        Notice that this is a *very* rudimentary form of bundle connections.
        A more detailed implementation is devoted to :trac:`28640`.
```
The only people who will care are developers, it is irrelevant to the use of this class, and it makes it come across as less polished.

The block after `They certainly obey the structure equation::` is over-indented.

A general comment (not something you need to address here, but I noticed it now): we should have a little mix-in class for `_latex_name` objects (or perhaps more generally `NamedObject`) so we don't have so much repeated boilerplate code.

Instead of `_hash_value`, the more standard naming is `_hash`.

Error messages should follow the general Python convention:

```diff
-raise ValueError("A frame must be provided!")
+raise ValueError("a frame must be provided")
```

Is this relevant? `# TODO: Compute transformations` Should it instead raise a `NotImplementedError`?

Is there some way we can automate this?

```
        .. WARNING::

            If the connection has already forms in other frames, it is the
            user's responsibility to make sure that the 1-forms to be added
            are consistent with them.
```

```diff
-computation in SAGE.
+computation in Sage.
```
Although really I would suggest just deleting that sentence (you already are using Sage and such an  internal working, if you insist on including it, should be in an `ALGORITHM:` section).

I generally dislike these things:

```
Class Documentation
-------------------
```
They don't convey any information and just are a bit of a distraction IMO.

`_get_predefined_class` is not a static method (it is just a separate function). Also ``arg`` -> ```arg```

This should just be an `if-else` statement:

```python
    c_dict = {}
    c_dict['ChernChar'] = ('complex', 'additive', 'ch', r'\mathrm{ch}', x.exp())
    c_dict['Todd'] = ('complex', 'additive', 'Td', r'\mathrm{Td}',
                      x / (1 - (-x).exp()))
    c_dict['Chern'] = ('complex', 'multiplicative', 'c', 'c', 1 + x)
    c_dict['Pontryagin'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'p', 'p', 1 + x)
    c_dict['AHat'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'A^', r'\hat{A}',
                      x.sqrt() / (2 * (x.sqrt() / 2).sinh()))
    c_dict['Hirzebruch'] = ('real', 'multiplicative', 'L', 'L',
                            (x.sqrt() / x.sqrt().tanh()))
    c_dict['Euler'] = ('real', 'Pfaffian', 'e', 'e', x)
    # Get class from arg
    try:
        res = c_dict[arg]
    except KeyError:
        raise ValueError("the characteristic class '{}' is ".format(arg) +
                         "not predefined yet.")
```
unless you were hoping to cache `c_dict`, but I don't see the utility in that as this should not be a bottleneck.

Do not abbreviate class names and `UniqueRepresentation` is better being first in the MRO:

```diff
-class CharClass(SageObject, UniqueRepresentation):
+class CharacteristicClass(UniqueRepresentation, SageObject):
```
IMO, generally you should avoid abbreviated names for inputs/function names/etc. for the main implementation (although it is okay to have an abbreviated alias). (For another example, `get_form(self, con, cmatrices=None):` and use `connection` instead of `con` and `def char_class` to `def characteristic_class`) This better self-documents the code and can make things more discoverable with tab completion. For example, I might type `.charact<tab>` and then be surprised that nothing comes up.

In `_get_coeff_list`, there is no need for the `coef` variable (just return the result).
Also

```diff
-(self._base_space._dim / 2).floor()
+self._base_space._dim // 2
```
and make `from sage.symbolic.ring import SR` at the top-level.

```diff
-- ``cmatrix`` curvature matrix
+- ``cmatrix`` -- curvature matrix
```

I gave a quik look. It looks nice!
Thanks for having taken into account Travis' remarks. I fully agree with them. 
Here a few remarks from my side: 

- There is a failed doctest:

```
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/char_class.py", line 685, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.char_class.CharacteristicClass.get_form
Failed example:
    ch_form.display()
Expected:
    ch(E, nabla^E) = ch_0(E, nabla^E) + zero + ch_1(E, nabla^E)
Got:
    ch(E, nabla^E) = ch_0.0(E, nabla^E) + zero + ch_1.0(E, nabla^E)
```
- There are two warnings when generating the documentation:

```
[manifolds] <unknown>:2566: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \c
[manifolds] <unknown>:2565: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \c
```
- in the OUTPUT section of `BundleConnection.add_connection_form()`, a back quote is missing:

```diff
- connection 1-form `\omega^i_j in the given frame, as an instance of
+ connection 1-form `\omega^i_j` in the given frame, as an instance of
```
- in the introduction to characteristic classes, `N` is not defined in the sentence

```
for any continuous map `f: M \to N`
```
- in the doctest example of `in DifferentiableVectorBundle.characteristic_class()`:

```diff
- sage: g = M.metric('g')
+ sage: g = M.metric()
```
(since `M` has been defined a Lorentzian manifold, `g` has already been initialized, with the name 'g')

That's strange...I don't get this error. Travis?

From my side, I think we are almost done here. Two last remarks:
- in the introduction to characteristic classes, `\mathfrak{g}` is not defined
- could the file `char_class.py` be renamed `characteristic_class.py`? (this would improve the readability of the directory `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable` and would match with the name of the class `CharacteristicClass`)
