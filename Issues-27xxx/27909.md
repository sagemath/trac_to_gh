This ticket fixes a Python 3 doctest failure in `smallest_poly()` in `sage.rings.polynomial.binary_form_reduce`.

In Python 3, the result of the function differs due to tiny floating point inaccuracies. I checked that the value that is minimized inside the function is the same in Python 2 and 3 (up to small tolerance), so apparently the result of the computation is not unique. In order to stay consistent between Python versions, I replaced the doctest by a test that checks the properties of the result instead of the result itself.

What I am not sure about: Does `smallest_poly()` return the polynomial for which `get_bound_poly()` attains its minimum? If so, perhaps this could be clarified in the documentation.
