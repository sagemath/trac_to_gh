The code clearly indicates that it should be grouped under that `if` statement, so I am fine with that change (although the alignment spacing looks a little odd, but I am not going to hold a positive review up for that).

I would argue the reason to avoid contractions is this is "formal" writing, where you should not use them (or so I've been told by my paper referees when I accidentally have one slip in).

Although I cannot test that this does work (I do not mac to test it on). If someone (Karl-Dieter) can verify that this works after the change, then we can flip it to positive.

> The code clearly indicates that it should be grouped under that `if` statement, so I am fine with that change (although the alignment spacing looks a little odd, but I am not going to hold a positive review up for that).

The spacing is because the original file has lots of tabs in it, and with the branch, some of those tabs have been replaced by spaces. It's an html file, so it shouldn't matter, I think.

> I would argue the reason to avoid contractions is this is "formal" writing, where you should not use them (or so I've been told by my paper referees when I accidentally have one slip in).

In this case we're quoting people (supposedly) so we should use their original words: if they used contractions, so should we. I'm too lazy to actually search for the original quotes to verify. (I'm really just echoing what kcrisman said already.)

> Although I cannot test that this does work (I do not mac to test it on). If someone (Karl-Dieter) can verify that this works after the change, then we can flip it to positive.

I'll try to test it and report back.
