```
y=function('y')(x)
desolve(diff(y)==4*y/x+x*sqrt(y),y,ics=[1,1]).factor()
```

returns

```
1/4*x^4*(log(x) - 2)^2
```

instead of

```
1/4*x^4*(log(x) + 2)^2
```

A bit of exploration (see sources) shows that:

* `sympy` and {{{giac}} both can find the correct solution

* `Mathematica` returns both the "righr" and the "wrong" solution

* The bug is an infortunate choice of roots :

```
y=function('y')(x)
Sol=desolve(diff(y)==4*y/x+x*sqrt(y),y).factor()
print Sol
var("_C")
(Sol.subs(x==1)==1).solve(_C)
```

returns :

```
1/4*(2*_C + log(x))^2*x^4
[_C == -1, _C == 1]
```

It turns out that the same problem occurs in `maxima` :

```
eq:'diff(y,x)=4*y/x+x*sqrt(y);
SG:factor(ode2(eq,y,x));
print(eq);
print(SG);
SP:factor(ic1(SG,x=1,y=1));
print(SP);
D1:subst([x=1],diff(rhs(SP),x));
print(D1);
D2:subst([x=1,y=1],rhs(eq));
print(D2);
```
returns :

```
dy   4 y
-- = --- + x sqrt(y) 
dx    x
     4                2
    x  (log(x) + 2 %c)
y = ------------------- 
             4
     4             2
    x  (log(x) - 2)
y = ---------------- 
           4
3 
5 
```

Therefore, I'm inclined to attribute this bug to `maxima`'s one. I intend to report it upstream ASAP (more precisely, as soon I'll have recovered a way to log onto the damn `sourceforge` site. Grrrr...).
