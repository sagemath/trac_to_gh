```
y=function('y')(x)
desolve(diff(y)==4*y/x+x*sqrt(y),y,ics=[1,1]).factor()
```

returns

```
1/4*x^4*(log(x) - 2)^2
```

instead of

```
1/4*x^4*(log(x) + 2)^2
```

A bit of exploration (see sources) shows that:

* `sympy` and {{{giac}} both can find the correct solution

* `Mathematica` returns both the "righr" and the "wrong" solution

* The bug is an infortunate choice of roots :

```
y=function('y')(x)
Sol=desolve(diff(y)==4*y/x+x*sqrt(y),y).factor()
print Sol
var("_C")
(Sol.subs(x==1)==1).solve(_C)
```

returns :

```
1/4*(2*_C + log(x))^2*x^4
[_C == -1, _C == 1]
```

It turns out that the same problem occurs in `maxima` :

```
eq:'diff(y,x)=4*y/x+x*sqrt(y);
SG:factor(ode2(eq,y,x));
print(eq);
print(SG);
SP:factor(ic1(SG,x=1,y=1));
print(SP);
D1:subst([x=1],diff(rhs(SP),x));
print(D1);
D2:subst([x=1,y=1],rhs(eq));
print(D2);
```
returns :

```
dy   4 y
-- = --- + x sqrt(y) 
dx    x
     4                2
    x  (log(x) + 2 %c)
y = ------------------- 
             4
     4             2
    x  (log(x) - 2)
y = ---------------- 
           4
3 
5 
```

Therefore, I'm inclined to attribute this bug to `maxima`'s one. I intend to report it upstream ASAP (more precisely, as soon I'll have recovered a way to log onto the damn `sourceforge` site. Grrrr...).

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
