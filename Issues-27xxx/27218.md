crypting makes use of GAP's compiler (aka `gac`), and other tooling, namely, `libtool`.

`gac` is installed with broken information about various paths and `sysinfo.gap` location, and `libtool` isn't installed at all, it seems.

Here is how gac's entries should be corrected:

```
abs_top_srcdir="${SAGE_LOCAL}/share/gap/src"
abs_top_builddir="${abs_top_srcdir}" # obsolete naming...
```
and one should source `sysinfo.gap` as

```
. "${abs_top_builddir}/../sysinfo.gap"
```

`libtool` should be installed along with `gac`.

<a id='comment:8'></a>
The following works:

1) create a symbolic link from SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap to SAGE_LOCAL/include/src
(this makes the patch for include locations unnecessary, also for GAP's IO

2) install GAP's libtool the same way we install gac.
(it should be one level below gac, in src/ subdirectory)

3) patch gac as explained

after this, with the patch in comment 2, crypting gets installed just fine.

my plan is now to do everything on #26930, and close this one, because it's too many small interconnecting things.

I think you're trying to combine too many different things in #26930.  Let's repurpose this ticket for fixing aspects of the GAP "installation" such as `sysinfo.gap` and correct installation of `gac`.

Then you can make #26930 depend on this.

So it appears that for building various compiled packages, their build system assumes you're also running GAP itself out of a source tree, such that various build-related utilities and files used for building GAP itself can be repurposed for building GAP packages.

Part of me is almost tempted to say that GAP packages should be built in a GAP build tree (i.e. re-extracting the main GAP source tarball, running `./configure` in it (though maybe not `make`; unclear) and then building the extension package.

However, what is actually needed for this might be narrow enough that we can install it into `share/gap`.  It's also clear that the `sysinfo.gap` file needs to be patched up.  Let me examine exactly what the "crypting" package is trying to do before moving forward.

Yes, I was just confirming.

I think sysinfo.gap needs to be fixed as well, but that's easy enough.

I would rather leave *all* of this to upstream, though maybe our experiences here will help me help them improve the installation system for GAP.

With this fix, which is admittedly a hack (but an appropriate one), I was able to compile the crypting package from just any arbitrary location so long as I ran `configure $SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap` first.

Actually *installing* is another question, albeit mostly just a question of copying the source tree for the package into `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap/pkg` while making sure to strip out any build artifacts.

For the record I don't intend to install gap's libtool in sage-on-gentoo. Yes gap has ugly bits just like sage had 10 years ago. `gac` could be an interesting tool once fixed and `sysinfo.gap` similarly needs to be more conform to an installation rather than an in tree thing. 

In the few packages where it was important so far, only `GAParch` was really needed for an install for me. The rest was superfluous. It would be useful if `sysinfo.gap` had the proper include path so the problem of `#include "src/..."` versus `#include "gap/..."` would go away. Sounds like a job for pkg-config.

Typically, `libtool` is not installed. It is shipped as part of the package installer and only used as build tool, analogous to `configure` for example.

That is, one still needs to take care of header location.
E.g.

```
ln -s $SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap $SAGE_LOCAL/include/src
```
allows crypting to be installed using the patch in comment 2.
Would you like this header issue to be solved here, or done on #26930?

Also I agree with Jeroen of course that normally a libtool script should not be installed, though in this case it might be reasonable to do.

> By the way, you should use `$SED`, not `sed`, right?


That's generally just in an autoconf macro, where if you have done `AC_PROG_SED`.  It's not necessarily bad practice to use a `$SED` variable either, in case it needs to be overridden for some reason, but in that case you'd still have to set a default somewhere, and we aren't doing that in any other `spkg-install` script.

Also, on OSX paths to binary files of GAP packages are not correct. E.g. `local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0-default64/` instead of `local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/bin/x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0-default64/`, and IO package does not load.
If I do 

```
$ mkdir local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/bin
$ mv local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0-default64 local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4
```
then it works.
