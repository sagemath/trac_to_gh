crypting makes use of GAP's compiler (aka `gac`), and other tooling, namely, `libtool`.

`gac` is installed with broken information about various paths and `sysinfo.gap` location, and `libtool` isn't installed at all, it seems.

Here is how gac's entries should be corrected:

```
abs_top_srcdir="${SAGE_LOCAL}/share/gap/src"
abs_top_builddir="${abs_top_srcdir}" # obsolete naming...
```
and one should source `sysinfo.gap` as

```
. "${abs_top_builddir}/../sysinfo.gap"
```

`libtool` should be installed along with `gac`.

Basically, `gac` expects `sysinfo.gap` in the build tree, not in place announced in the 2nd line: `Using config in...`.

<a id='comment:8'>Comment 8:</a>
The following works:

1) create a symbolic link from SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap to SAGE_LOCAL/include/src
(this makes the patch for include locations unnecessary, also for GAP's IO

2) install GAP's libtool the same way we install gac.
(it should be one level below gac, in src/ subdirectory)

3) patch gac as explained

after this, with the patch in comment 2, crypting gets installed just fine.

my plan is now to do everything on #26930, and close this one, because it's too many small interconnecting things.

I think you're trying to combine too many different things in #26930.  Let's repurpose this ticket for fixing aspects of the GAP "installation" such as `sysinfo.gap` and correct installation of `gac`.

Then you can make #26930 depend on this.

So it appears that for building various compiled packages, their build system assumes you're also running GAP itself out of a source tree, such that various build-related utilities and files used for building GAP itself can be repurposed for building GAP packages.

Part of me is almost tempted to say that GAP packages should be built in a GAP build tree (i.e. re-extracting the main GAP source tarball, running `./configure` in it (though maybe not `make`; unclear) and then building the extension package.

However, what is actually needed for this might be narrow enough that we can install it into `share/gap`.  It's also clear that the `sysinfo.gap` file needs to be patched up.  Let me examine exactly what the "crypting" package is trying to do before moving forward.

Yes, I was just confirming.

I think sysinfo.gap needs to be fixed as well, but that's easy enough.

I would rather leave *all* of this to upstream, though maybe our experiences here will help me help them improve the installation system for GAP.

With this fix, which is admittedly a hack (but an appropriate one), I was able to compile the crypting package from just any arbitrary location so long as I ran `configure $SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap` first.

Actually *installing* is another question, albeit mostly just a question of copying the source tree for the package into `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap/pkg` while making sure to strip out any build artifacts.

not all GAP packages live in this tarball. Not installing the necessary components to build GAP packages will lead to a half-broken GAP installation. I don't think it's a good idea.

```

That is, one still needs to take care of header location.
E.g.

```
ln -s $SAGE_LOCAL/include/gap $SAGE_LOCAL/include/src
```
allows crypting to be installed using the patch in comment 2.
Would you like this header issue to be solved here, or done on #26930?

Something about this still isn't working right then, because this

```
-I/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local/var/tmp/sage/build/gap-4.10.0.p0/src/src
```

should not be in the compile flags.  I thought I made sure there would be no more references to the build directory, but I was tired last night when I was working on this so I must have missed something.

Also I agree with Jeroen of course that normally a libtool script should not be installed, though in this case it might be reasonable to do.

If I do 

```
$ mkdir local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/bin
$ mv local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4/x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0-default64 local/lib/gap/pkg/io-4.5.4

then it works.
