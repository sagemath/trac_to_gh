`long(...)` is not defined in Python 3, and so we should remove all calls to `long`. We should also delete all methods `__long__`, and remove the special-casing for `long` in Python 3 doctesting (in `doctest/forker.py`).

Sage 9.2 will not support Python 2 anymore, so that is this ticket's target release.

Replying to [ticket:27826 jhpalmieri]:

Are there really that many places where an integer/rational is explicitly converted to a `long`? That worries me. I really want to understand better why you're not applying this everywhere (needs_info for that reason).

About the patch itself:

1. in `src/sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pyx` you messed up the spacing of `"""`

2. I don't understand the comment `This is deprecated, but the ``TypeError`` takes precedence over the deprecation warning when this is run.` How does the error "take precedence" over the warning, what are you trying to say?

Easy to fix.
 
> 2. I don't understand the comment `This is deprecated, but the ``TypeError`` takes precedence over the deprecation warning when this is run.` How does the error "take precedence" over the warning, what are you trying to say?


By "take precedence", I mean that no deprecation warning is printed, just the `TypeError`. I'm trying to explain why there is no doctest with a deprecation warning. That could be clearer.

I would prefer to address that on another ticket: deal with the easy cases here (and also #27829) and then think about ZZ and QQ.

I haven't investigated at all, just saw that it was a mess and so I wanted to put it off. Does Python's `range` try to convert to `long` in Python 2? Or do some other Python built-ins do that?
