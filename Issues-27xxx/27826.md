```
`long(...)` is not defined in Python 3, and so we should remove all calls to `long`. We should also delete all methods `__long__`, and remove the special-casing for `long` in Python 3 doctesting (in `doctest/forker.py`).

Sage 9.2 will not support Python 2 anymore, so that is this ticket's target release.

Replying to [ticket:27826 jhpalmieri]:
> Notable classes which are not included: integers and rational numbers. This is mainly because those classes are used in so many places in the Sage library that deprecation warnings for them would get triggered many times during doctesting.

Are there really that many places where an integer/rational is explicitly converted to a `long`? That worries me. I really want to understand better why you're not applying this everywhere (needs_info for that reason).

About the patch itself:

1. in `src/sage/libs/mpmath/ext_main.pyx` you messed up the spacing of `"""`

2. I don't understand the comment <code>This is deprecated, but the \`\`TypeError\`\` takes precedence over the deprecation warning when this is run.</code> How does the error "take precedence" over the warning, what are you trying to say?

Regarding integer/rational: if I add deprecation warnings to those, I get over 800 files with failures. Many involve `set_random_seed` or other uses of randomization:

Easy to fix.

By "take precedence", I mean that no deprecation warning is printed, just the `TypeError`. I'm trying to explain why there is no doctest with a deprecation warning. That could be clearer.

What's your plan for *external* packages calling `long(...)`? For example, `fpylll` does this and I don't think it's wrong for them to do that.

This is especially true from the point of view of Cython and the Python/C API, where the `long` class in Python 2 is the same as the `int` class in Python 3 (you might think that Python 3 removed the `long` class but what really happened is they removed `int` and then renamed `long` -> `int`).

So I'm now leaning towards closing this ticket as "wontfix".
