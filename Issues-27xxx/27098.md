The string format in line 338 of `src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py`
`raise ValueError("there must not be an element of valuation -Infinity in the domain of valuation"%(valuation,))`
was passing an argument but the string didn't have one.
I've amended the string to accept the argument to:
`raise ValueError("there must not be an element of valuation -Infinity in the domain of valuation %r"%(valuation,))`

I work for Semmle and I noticed the bug with our LGTM code analyzer
https://lgtm.com/projects/g/sagemath/sage/snapshot/dist-132890344-1548102310071/files/src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field_valuation.py?sort=name&dir=ASC&mode=heatmap#x394f902069b4c04f:1
