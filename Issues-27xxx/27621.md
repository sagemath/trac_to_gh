#27124 introduced a doctest for the validity of the file manifests in `local/var/lib/sage/installed/`. This breaks at least on nix, perhaps on other distros, because those manifests are either not present or are just empty placeholders.

Depends on #27622

The `package_manifest` function can certainly test first and bail out if the file or directory does not exist, but if the file exists and is empty, then the test will fail (and probably should fail).

So what options are there? Should we create a new doctest tag – `# optional - buildsystem` was suggested at #27124 – which is on by default and depends on Sage's packaging infrastructure? It doesn't have to be an "optional" tag, it could be a different type of tag, the way we have `random` or `py2` or `long time`, etc.
