<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Indeed.\\
And it's clearly a gmpy2 issue :

```
>>> from gmpy2 import mpz
>>> import gmpy2
>>> class One:
...     def __mpz__(self): return mpz(1)
... 
>>> class Two:
...     def __mpz__(self): return mpz(2)
... 
>>> gmpy2.mpq(Two())
mpq(2,1)
>>> gmpy2.mpq(One(), Two())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: cannot convert object to mpq

```

I will look at this.
