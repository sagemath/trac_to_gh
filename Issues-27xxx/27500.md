I don't understand how this could be closed fixed as it breaks the building of the documentation.

```

This ticket replace `Livi1993` in `sage/knots/link.py` with `Liv1993` in `doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` unfortunately there are still some instances of `Livi1993` left in `sage/knots/link.py`
