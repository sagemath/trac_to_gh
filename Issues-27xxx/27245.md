In py2 we always get `{'a', 'b'}`, but in py3 I get `{'b', 'a'}`. So I proposed to used a sorted list to ensure that we always get the same result. Alternatives are to tag doctests as `# py2` or `# py3`, or to change the test to check equality with the set `{'a', 'b'}`, etc. I don't know which is the best option here.
