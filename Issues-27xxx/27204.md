Linking with `LDFLAGS = -Wl,--as-needed` fails due to wrong ordering of arguments. This option is the default in Ubuntu and it was reported in https://bugs.debian.org/919573 . According to the report the libraries should be placed after the object files for this to work, which is not always the case.

Now that I'm looking again at the Debian bug report, in the example there the libraries do come after the object file. Let me test myself if the Debian package builds with --as-needed.

Importance of linking order is also mentioned here: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Quality_Assurance/As-needed#Importance_of_linking_order

It is the default on Gentoo and its been some time since I have seen an issue like that in sage itself. I'll have to inspect my build logs to see if I have the order correct.
