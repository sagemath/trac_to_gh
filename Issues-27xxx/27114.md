Is there any reason why the patchbot emmits:

Shouldn't it have `autotools` installed?

On OSX this "works" okay, or doesn't work as the case may be, in that it (correctly) fails to find `pkg-config`, and thus does not try to *use* `pkg-config`.

I am seeing some other troubling problems failing to detect a system libffi on OSX, but I think whatever that problem is predates this ticket.
