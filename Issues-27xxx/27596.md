Oops, wrong field.  

Still, it would help if you specified more specifically what the intent was in the description.

The most recent patchbot failure was from mine, and it got screwed up due to being out of disk space.  I imagine this is still fine.

There was a test with a wrong name

```
-    def test_logging(self):
+    def test_overriding(self):
```
Also some unused imports.

Also some changes here, to use a more precise assert:

```
-        if len(msg) > 0:
-            self.assertEqual(msg[0], ('INFO', 'Downloading the Sage mirror list'))
-        self.assertTrue(len(ml.mirrors) >= 0)
+        if msg:
+            self.assertEqual(msg[0],
+                             ('INFO', 'Downloading the Sage mirror list'))
+        self.assertGreaterEqual(len(ml.mirrors), 0)
```
and some unused variables (twice)

```
-        with CapturedLog() as log:
+        with CapturedLog() as _:
```
