Oops, wrong field.  

Still, it would help if you specified more specifically what the intent was in the description.

There was a test with a wrong name

```
-    def test_logging(self):
+    def test_overriding(self):
```
Also some unused imports.

Also some changes here, to use a more precise assert:

```
-        if len(msg) > 0:
-            self.assertEqual(msg[0], ('INFO', 'Downloading the Sage mirror list'))
-        self.assertTrue(len(ml.mirrors) >= 0)
+        if msg:
+            self.assertEqual(msg[0],
+                             ('INFO', 'Downloading the Sage mirror list'))
+        self.assertGreaterEqual(len(ml.mirrors), 0)
```
and some unused variables (twice)

```
-        with CapturedLog() as log:
+        with CapturedLog() as _:
```
