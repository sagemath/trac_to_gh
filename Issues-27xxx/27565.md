There is a bug in OpenBLAS [already fixed upstream](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/1957) which I am encountering on Cygwin, though it could also affect Linux (in fact the original bug report was for Linux).

For Sage, this bug is causing a segfault on Cygwin when running

```
./sage -t --long src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/vectorfield.py
```

but it could happen arbitrarily anywhere that uses OpenBLAS and that happens to use threads (even without using OpenBLAS threads).

I have already confirmed that the upstream fix resolves the issue for me.

Keywords: **openblas**

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, but not in a stable release.**
