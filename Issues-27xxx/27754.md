<a id='comment:16'></a>I see the same problem with matplotlib. For laughs, I put a `print(dir(os))` command right before the line `link_to = os.link`. The output is identical to what I get when I do `import os; dir(os)` from `sage --python3`, except it is missing `link`.

If I run `make -k`, I also see problems building the Sage library, by the way: lots of errors of the form

```
RuntimeError: 
        An attempt has been made to start a new process before the
        current process has finished its bootstrapping phase.

        This probably means that you are not using fork to start your
        child processes and you have forgotten to use the proper idiom
        in the main module:

            if __name__ == '__main__':
                freeze_support()
                ...

        The "freeze_support()" line can be omitted if the program
        is not going to be frozen to produce an executable.

> I see the same problem with matplotlib. For laughs, I put a `print(dir(os))` command right before the line `link_to = os.link`. The output is identical to what I get when I do `import os; dir(os)` from `sage --python3`, except it is missing `link`.


That makes no sense. Somebody is fooling with us...

Could you try also `print(os)`? Maybe there is a different `os` module shadowing the standard one or something...

Just in case, I checked that the problem unfortunately persists after `make distclean`.

And a Google search for this error doesn't find anything.

On an OS X 10.14 machine, one affected by #27631 (no `/usr/include`), `pip` builds just fine, so I think Python and pip are finding zlib, but Pillow does not. 

If I keep the Pillow patch, it fails to build at all, with the error mentioned above. If I delete the Pillow patch and build, I see in its log file "The headers and library files could not be found for zlib".

<a id='comment:35'></a>I think the problem is this (from the [3.8 changelog](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380b1/)):

```
on macOS, the spawn start method is now used by default in multiprocessing
```
The documentation for `multiprocessing` then points to a [bug report](https://bugs.python.org/issue33725) which discusses our old friend `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY` (#25921). So if we get multiprocessing to work properly on OS X, maybe we can remove the line

```
    export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```
from sage-env.

In the meantime, I don't know how to get it working properly; using `fork` instead of `spawn` in `src/setup.py` is the only way I've found to proceed so far. I don't understand the distinctions in the [multiprocessing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods) between `fork` and `spawn` to know what should be set differently to use `spawn` correctly.

I made a similar change to allow docbuilding to work. Now I get failures with docbuilding. First, lots of warnings:

```
..../local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_agg.py:531: DeprecationWarning: PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN will be required for '#' formats
```
Then an error:

```

Changing the import to something like

except ImportError:
    from time import clock

* The sympy issue has been fixed 16 days ago.
* I have just made a pull request for brial
* The zmq issue is already fixed in https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/blob/master/zmq/backend/cffi/_poll.py
* The last line (our own information_set_decoder.py) is already correctly using a try/except for this import.

<a id='comment:55'></a>After taking a closer look, besides some string changes, most of the failures fall into one of the following categories:

(1) Hash changes - all hashes have changed in 3.8. This requires updating many tests, making them conditional on the python version. Not sure if it makes sense to fork so many tests at this point rather than just drop python2 support or at least not run those tests.

(2) Sorting changes - many lists are now output in a different order. Same comment as in (1) about the solution.

(3) "DeprecationWarning: In future, it will be an error for 'np.bool_' scalars to be interpreted as an index" from numpy. These are fixed with https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/commit/4651a125

(4) "DeprecationWarning: PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN will be required for '#' formats" - this happens mostly when pickling/unpickling functions. No idea where the actual code that throws the warning is.

(5) "DeprecationWarning: an integer is required (got type sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral).  Implicit conversion to integers using __int__ is deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of Python." when calling time.sleep with a Sage (sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral) float. Coercing to float first fixes the issue.

(6) "SyntaxWarning: "is" with a literal. Did you mean "=="?" when comparing strings with 'is'

(7) Use of the removed cgi.escape in sage/interacts/debugger.py. Should be changed to html.escape.

(8) The signature of code() (used in sage/misc/fpickle.pyx) has changed and now requires a 'posonlyargcount' argument.

(9) Mismatch after pickling/unpickling for some objects:

```
sage: A = Poset()._hasse_diagram.antichains()
sage: A == loads(dumps(A))
False
```


For packagers that don't care about python2 compatibility (or 32 bit hashes) a WIP patch that fixes or works around most of these issues is at https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/sagemath-python-3.8.patch?h=sagemath-git. A backport of https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/commit/74d86170 is also needed.

As far as I can see, this config variable was invented in #27631 and is not available on any other Python than our patched Python.

`@`arojas, I'm trying to update sage on nix to 9.0 with python 3.8. I'm using your 3.8 patch in the 9.0 version [1]. I'm still seeing some test failures caused by the python update though:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/homset.py  # 3 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver_mutation_type.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/finite_state_machine.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/posets/hasse_diagram.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/groups/cubic_braid.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex_morphism.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/structure/sequence.py  # 2 doctests failed
```

Here[2] is the full log. You said that your patch fixes "most" failures, so is that to be expected? Do you have the same failures on arch?

I had a look at the python 3.8 changelog, the most obvious change seemed to be the change of the default pickle protocol (3 -> 4). But I have patched python to revert that change and that did not fix the issue.

I'll look into git-bisect'ing the cpython update, though that is of course not exactly trivial. Maybe it will help.

Sure, this is what we should do for this ticket.

My guess is that these tests are there to guard against thoughtless or accidental changes to hash functions. 

I could imagine that we may want to change these tests to something like this:

```
    sage: hash(x) in (5050909583595644741, -925386691174542829, 234567876545678)
    True
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>I wrote a long post about simplicial complexes with various solutions, but now I realize there is a simpler solution.

There are a few problems here: first, if you want consistency when dealing with products of simplicial complexes, some sorting is needed: if you triangulate a square, for example, you have two choices for how to add the diagonal, and different sortings will result in different choices. Second, Python 3.7 and 3.8 are handling some data differently from each other, and that's where the doctest failure in `simplicial_complex_morphism.py` is coming from: different sortings yielding different triangulations of a product. Third, I think that this really means that the doctest in `simplicial_complex_morphishm.py` is a bad one, because it is essentially relying on how intrinsically unsorted data is converted to an ordered object (a tuple). I tried putting in various ways of sorting, and I got at least three different results, all of which are mathematically valid, and I don't see any reason to force one sorting option over another.

As a result, we should make this change: get rid of the new sorting in `simplicial_complex.py` and make the doctest more robust:

Well, that didn't work for me (with `EXTRA_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-system-suitesparse=no"`): the build failed for `cypari` and `giac`. But I used VirtualBox to install a 32-bit Debian machine, and I see the doctest failures. I actually haven't looked at the hecke_triangle_groups.py failure — not my area of expertise — but I understand what's happening with the homology failure. There are some unsorted pieces of data lying around, and when they get converted to lists or tuples, how they get converted affects the answer. Both answers (32-bit and 64-bit) are mathematically correct, it's just that you get a different choice of bases in the two cases.

I propose changing to a case where the sorting won't affect the answer.
