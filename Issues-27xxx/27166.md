The 2 classes contains a deprecation warning since at least #10900 (from 2011), and classes `XGraph` and `XDiGraph` have been replaced by class `MultiGraph` and `MultiDiGraph` in `NetworkX 0.99` released in 2008.
So it's time to remove these classes from file `src/sage/graphs/base/graph_backends.pyx`.

Furthermore, this fix the doctest error with py3 in `graph_backends.pyx`.
