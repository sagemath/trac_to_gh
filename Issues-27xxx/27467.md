From https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/6kuvliWzi84:

```
sage: for w in Permutations(3):
....:     w, w.weak_covers()
....:
([1, 2, 3], [])
([1, 3, 2], [[1, 2, 3]])
([2, 1, 3], [[1, 2, 3]])
([2, 3, 1], [[3, 2, 1]])
([3, 1, 2], [[3, 2, 1]])
([3, 2, 1], [[3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1]])

The fourth and fifth lines of the output are incorrect.
The correct values should be

([2, 3, 1], [[2, 1, 3]])
([3, 1, 2], [[1, 3, 2]])
```

This manifests also in creating the weak order poset:

```
sage: Permutations(3).weak_poset()
...
ValueError: Hasse diagram contains cycles
```

This is a left-vs-right issue and `Permutation` multiplication being a little strange with respect to that. We also remove the multiplication argument and convention effects from `has_*_descent`.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The problem is the multiplication for a permutation seems to have the oppose effect (by default):

```
sage: W = Permutations(3)
sage: w = W([2,3,1])
sage: w.reduced_word()
[1, 2]
sage: w.descents(side='right')
[2]
sage: w.apply_simple_reflection_right(2)
[3, 2, 1]
```
So we need to override `apply_simple_reflection_*` for `Permutation`.
