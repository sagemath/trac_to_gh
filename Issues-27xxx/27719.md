If a file `file.sage` has a line `from `__future__` import ...`, the preparser should put it at the top of the file [where it needs to be](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#future).

Made a tiny update: appending a few items to a list should be quite cheap (extra room should be available). The pythonic way of joining strings together is via "join" (it's faster; not that it matters here)

Let's see what the patchbots say. The previous reports had some failures (perhaps spurious). Otherwise: I'm OK with your changes. If you're OK with mine you can set it to positive on my behalf.
