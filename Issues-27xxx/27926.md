Currently constructions of new polyhedra in `Polyhedron_base` do not preserve the backend:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[0]], backend='field').pyramid().backend()
'ppl'
```

This ticket fixes this.

This respects the users intentions, who might have chosen a specific backend for a good reason. Also, once #25097 is merged, this is needed to have the constructions work for polyhedra over number fields.

More precisely the constructions are:

- `minkowski_sum` (taken care of by `@coerce_binop` and constructing from `self.parent().element_class`)
- `minkowski_difference` (taken care of by `@coerce_binop` and constructing from `self.parent().element_class`)
- `translation`,
- `product`,
- `join`,
- `subdirect_sum`,
- `direct_sum`,
- `dilation`,
- `convex_hull` (taken care of by `@coerce_binop` and constructing from `self.parent().element_class`),
- `intersection` (taken care of by `@coerce_binop` and constructing from `self.parent().element_class`),
- `truncation`,
- `face_truncation`,
- `stack`,
- `lawrence_extension`,
- `lawrence_polytope`,
- `polar` (fixed already, #25081),
- `pyramid`,
- `bipyramid`,
- `prism`,
- `face_split`,
- `affine_hull`.

I missed this instance. I'll fix it like the other methods.
There is a new function `test_backend` that tests if a combination of `backend` and `base_ring` will work.

I am not sure this is the right approach. The same code is copied in each single function. I think what is done with matrices is more sensible and the information about the backend is actually stored into the parents

```
sage: M1 = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3, implementation='gap')
sage: M1
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_gap)
sage: M2 = MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3, implementation='generic')
sage: M2
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_generic_dense)
```
The rules about promotions such as

```
sage: parent(M1.an_element() * M2.an_element())
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring
```
are handled by the parents and this is what it should be done for polyhedra as well.

I guess I should work with `Polyhedra_base.base_extend`.

Either I introduce a new option for `backend`, such as `keep` or a change the default behavior to attempt to keep the backend, if possible.

What do you think?

I find the default behavior to be strange at the moment. I have a Polyhedron, change the base ring and all the sudden I use a different backend, even though the old one would have worked.

There is no discussion about the fact that the current behavior is wrong. I tried to argue that your initial solution was not optimal. Namely, the parents already carry the backend information (`Polyhedra_QQ_ppl`, `Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl`, ...). Anytime a new polyhedra is constructed inside a method, the new parent should be chosen via a query to the parent.

Modifying `Polyhedra_base.base_extend` is a good idea. If the new `base_ring` supports the current backend, it should be kept.

Though at this point, I don't quite understand the difference between `base_extend` and `change_ring`... that would better be clarified.

I believe `change_ring` was created after `base_extend` as `base_extend` doesn't allow the ring to become smaller. Either way `base_extend` should just call `change_ring` with the coerced ring (and `change_ring` should return `self` if possible).

Ok. I will now proceed as follows:

1. Let `change_ring` call `base_extend`. (Btw. the error checking with regard to inexact rings in `Polyhedron_base.change_ring` really should be left to parent as well.)

2. Create a new parent only if needed.

3. Change default behavior of `None` in `change_ring` to leave `backend` if possible.

4. Simplify all the methods to obtain a parent with `base_extend` and then initialize from that parent.

I think the logic in `change_ring` would better be simplified to

```
        if ambient_dim is None:
            ambient_dim = self.ambient_dim()

        if base_ring == self.base_ring() and \
           ambient_dim == self.ambient_dim() and \
           backend is None or backend == self.backend():
                return self

        # if not specified, try the same backend
        if backend is None and does_backend_handle_base_ring(base_ring, self.backend()):
            return Polyhedra(base_ring, ambient_dim, backend=self.backend())

        return Polyhedra(base_ring, ambient_dim, backend=backend)
```

Also, you should add more examples to `change_ring`. In particular when something has changed with respect to older versions such as

```
sage: Polyhedra(QQ, 3, backend='cdd').change_ring(RDF).backend()
'cdd'
```

`base_extend` is a calque from the same function for example for matrices, that creates a new parent with an extended ring and coerces `self` into this new parent and returns it.

As Jonathan said, this can only go in one direction and was not really adapted to polyhedra objects. This led to introduce `change_ring` to have all the flexibility possible (and perhaps a more intuitive name than `base_extend`) and because you can't really change ring without caring about the backend, `change_backend` and `change_ring` are bound to have fuzzy differences and may even call eachother (hopefully in only 1 direction!).

So yes, it is subtle and I am all in favor of rationalizing `base_extend`, `change_ring` and `change_backend` (which is not all there yet).
