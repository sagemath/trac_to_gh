After having implemented ribbon graphs and tête-à-tête graphs, this ticket is devoted to implement mixed tête-à-tête graphs which are a generalization of pure tête-à-tête graphs and codify pseudo-periodic
automorphisms of surfaces. The goal is to implement them together with a series of functions that compute several invariants such as the action of the automorphism on the integral homology or the invariants of the associated graph manifold.

Keywords: tete-a-tete graphs, graphs, combinatorial, geometry
