Converting expressions involving Gamma functions from Mathematica to Sage currently fails:

```python
sage: mathematica('Gamma[4/3]').sage()
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Mathematica                 output: Gamma(4/3)

sage: mathematica('Gamma[4/3, 1]').sage()  # This should be the upper incomplete Gamma function `gamma(4/3, 1)` in Sage.
gamma_inc_lower(4/3, 1)

sage: mathematica('Gamma[4/3, 0, 1]').sage()
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Mathematica                 output: Gamma(4/3, 0, 1)
```

Moreover, this should convert to `Gamma[4/3, 0, 1]` in Mathematica:

```python
sage: gamma_inc_lower(4/3, 1)._mathematica_()
Gamma[4/3, 1]
```

The reason for this is that all three kinds of Gamma functions (the (complete) Gamma, the upper incomplete Gamma `gamma_inc` and the lower incomplete `gamma_inc_lower`) all convert to `Gamma` in Mathematica, but the conversion does not properly take into account that the arguments to those functions are different. Conversely, `Gamma` is currently registered to convert to `gamma_inc_lower`, which is always wrong and fails as shown above.

More precisely, there are the following correspondences:
- `gamma(x)` and `Gamma[x]`,
- `gamma(x, y)` and `Gamma[x, y]`,
- `gamma_inc_lower(x, z)` and `Gamma[x, 0, z]`,
- `gamma(x, y) - gamma(x, z)` and `Gamma[x, y, z]`.

The Mathematica documentation for this can be found here: https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Gamma.html.

This was tested with Sage 8.6 and Mathematica 11.3.

It works as advertised and all the tests pass on my machine. My knowledge of the
Gamma function is too limited to spot any mathematical issue. 

Feel free to set this to positive review if you are confident on the math side.
