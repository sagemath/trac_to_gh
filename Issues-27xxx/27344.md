ISTM part of the point of giving it a fixed value was at some point primarily for some performance purpose, but it's not clear what that purpose was exactly or what benchmark this was targeting.

I think the reason for this, at least, was that on 32-bit Python the str hashing function overflows, whereas on 64-bit it isn't as likely to overflow for a short string, but either way between 32-bit and 64-bit the hash values wind up the same modulo 2^!32.

That still raises the question of why there was a desire for `hash(RDF) == hash(str(RDF))` especially since that does not hold on 64-bit.

I think then it suffices to demonstrate that `hash(RDF) == hash(RealDoubleField_class())` and to mention that this class is intended for use as a singleton so any instance of it should be equivalent from a hashing perspective.
