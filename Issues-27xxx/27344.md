I'm sorry, I'd be frustrated too, but in the same vein I don't think we should waste time writing pointless doctests that prove nothing.

I personally have no idea what the intent is here for these classes implementing `__hash__` or if there's even any reason for them to do so at all.  Perhaps we should find that out.

In particular I don't get the "mod 2!^32" part, although it does appear to hold accurate on Python 2.  Though it seems part of the point is that `hash(RDF)` and `hash(str(RDF))` are *not* the same:

```
sage: {RDF: 1, str(RDF): 2}
{Real Double Field: 1, 'Real Double Field': 2}
```

ISTM part of the point of giving it a fixed value was at some point primarily for some performance purpose, but it's not clear what that purpose was exactly or what benchmark this was targeting.

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A8):

I think the reason for this, at least, was that on 32-bit Python the str hashing function overflows, whereas on 64-bit it isn't as likely to overflow for a short string, but either way between 32-bit and 64-bit the hash values wind up the same modulo 2^!32.

That still raises the question of why there was a desire for `hash(RDF) == hash(str(RDF))` especially since that does not hold on 64-bit.

I think then it suffices to demonstrate that `hash(RDF) == hash(RealDoubleField_class())` and to mention that this class is intended for use as a singleton so any instance of it should be equivalent from a hashing perspective.
