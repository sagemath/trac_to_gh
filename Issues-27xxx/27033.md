`DynkinDiagram_class` is a derived class of `GenericGraph`. It specializes the `relabel()` method of `GenericGraph`, but it changes the interface. Generally, it is expected that a method in a derived class keeps (possibly extends) the API of the base class.

Concretely, we fix the following issues:

1. A permutation is required to be given. This is in contrast to `GenericGraph.relabel()` which allows no permutation (in that case, vertices will be relabelled to `range(G.order())`)

2. `return_map` is not supported.

Indeed; but as far as I remember this is always at "construction time" when the to be constructed diagram can be built from an existing one by doing some small edits: make a copy, do a couple edits, and then freeze the result forever. We could revisit our Dynkin diagrams to always set them as immutable once constructed.

Just curious: why it is clear that dynkin diagrams should be immutable but graphs not? Because that's really what this ticket is about: that graphs and dynkin diagrams behave differently even though the first is a superclass of the second.

It makes a copy and then relabels that copy in-place.

My answer is going to be more art than science :-)

In most use cases, Dynkin diagram are used to model mathematical objects from which computations will be done. On the other hand, graphs are often used more as a data structure on which algorithm will be run. Also, Dynkin diagrams tend to be small, and the overhead of having to create copies is not an issue. Whereas graphs can be big and you would not want to be forced to do such copies at every step of the execution of an algorithm.

That's roughly the same situation as for our polynomials which are always immutable, whereas our matrices can be mutable or not depending on the use case.

Ok. If our Dynkin diagrams would be flagged as immutable, would this resolve the original issue?
(up to maybe having to reset the immutable flag)?

For the record: the main reason that I am reluctant to change the interface for "relabel" is that Dynkin diagrams are special case of cartan types: they are in the `CartanType_abstract` class where relabel is defined to not take argument and return a new object. So that change would break that compatibility, and presumably this would break generic code about cartan types.

No, because the original issue is that generic graph code expects `G.relabel()` to relabel in-place. If they would be immutable, then an exception would be raised by this disallowed in-place relabelling.

I see what you mean: we have

```
class DynkinDiagram_class(DiGraph, CartanType_abstract)
```
where both subclasses (`DiGraph` and `CartanType_abstract`) have a `relabel()` method which happens to be incompatible.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

I did a search of `relabel()` methods on various combinatorial objects. There are various behaviours:

**A. in-place by default, allowing not in-place**

1. cluster algebra quivers

2. incidence structures

3. graphs (various classes)

**B1. not in-place by default, allowing in-place**

1. Dynkin diagrams

**B2. always not in-place**

1. constellations

2. posets

3. anything else involving root systems (various classes)

4. matroids

I don't know what to conclude from this...
