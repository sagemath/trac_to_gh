Perhaps it would be better to have `min=0` be the default, and so we can change this test:

```diff
-        if ((min is None and max is None) or
-            (max is None and self.get_aorder() >= min)):
+        if (max is None and (not min or self.get_aorder() >= min)):

Dumb thing, but this change makes it overindented:

```
-            (max is None and self.get_aorder() >= min)):
-            return self
+             (max is None and self.get_aorder() >= min)):
+             return self
```
Once fixed and green bot (either before or after), you can set back to a positive review.
