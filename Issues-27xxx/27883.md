In #22154 (merged in a recent beta), a new `log` parameter was introduced. This was very specifically done for this parameter and does not allow any easy extensions. The aim of this ticket is to generalize this by using a general `locals` parameter. (In this sense it can be seen as a fixup for #22154.)

(Note that no deprecation for `log` is needed, as this was only merged in a recent beta and not yet in a stable release.)

Without the parenthesis it doesn't work either

I thought exactly about doing this. However, I decided not not use it, so that all these kind of parameter passing because:
- When usually something is defined in [SageMath](SageMath) globally, it should be overridden in a well defined manner and that's `locals`.
- This scales to other (future) extensions.
- By using `locals` (only), it is somehow self explanatory (when knowing what locals is), what it does, whereas I find a `log` parameter less obvious (although not too bad either).

Therefore, I removed the `log` parameter completely.

Alright. I see, and agree with your conclusion. (Besides, I would assume that if someone wants to use a custom log function, then they should set it globally for their entire `AsymptoticRing` anyways; adapting the log locally probably isn't really that common anyways.)

I want to do some further investigations regarding this ticket; I should be done soon.
