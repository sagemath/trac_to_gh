In #22154 (merged in a recent beta), a new `log` parameter was introduced. This was very specifically done for this parameter and does not allow any easy extensions. The aim of this ticket is to generalize this by using a general `locals` parameter. (In this sense it can be seen as a fixup for #22154.)

(Note that no deprecation for `log` is needed, as this was only merged in a recent beta and not yet in a stable release.)

Without the parenthesis it doesn't work either

```
>>> di={1:2, 3:4}
>>> sorted(di.items(), key=lambda k,v: k)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: <lambda>() missing 1 required positional argument: 'v'
```
Not sure, how to nicely rewrite this (I am now using `lambda e: e[0]` which I find less nice but it works.)

Ok, seems to be just this way according to

They say I should rather use `lambda k_v: k_v[0]`.

I reviewed the changes and overall, I like this approach to make the module more flexible.

Personally, I would prefer if the `log` function in the `AsymptoticRing` still had a parameter to which an alternative log could be passed directly, instead of passing it inside a `locals`-dictionary; just as a convenience method. What do you think about that?

I thought exactly about doing this. However, I decided not not use it, so that all these kind of parameter passing because:
- When usually something is defined in [SageMath](SageMath) globally, it should be overridden in a well defined manner and that's `locals`.
- This scales to other (future) extensions.
- By using `locals` (only), it is somehow self explanatory (when knowing what locals is), what it does, whereas I find a `log` parameter less obvious (although not too bad either).

Therefore, I removed the `log` parameter completely.
