CC:  @saraedum

Keywords: function fields, polynomials, factorization

The following gives a NotImplementedError:

```python
  sage: F0.<x> = FunctionField(GF(3))
  sage: R.<y> = F0[]
  sage: F.<y> = F0.extension(y^2 - x)
  sage: S.<t> = F[] 
  sage: f = t^2 - x
  sage: f.factor()
```

I have some very simple code that I could add which solves this temporarily. It uses prime factorization in multivariate polynomial rings, and so implicitly uses Groebner bases. While there are certainly much better approaches, say, for function fields over finite fields, this code would already be very helpful.

A bad implementation is better than none in this case. If you want to propose a fix, I am happy to review it. (And I'll try not to take 7 weeks to do soâ€¦)
