#27484 adds an `sdh_cmake` helper function for use by our handful of (all currently optional/experimental) packages.  We should try updating those packages to use the new helper:

* cryptominisat
* primecount (#27485)
* qhull
* scipoptsuite

Of these, only scipoptsuite is somewhat unusual in that it does a sort of VPATH build in that it cds into a `build/` directory and then runs `cmake ..`.  This is incompatible with the current implementation of `sdh_cmake`.  So for that package either we don't use `sdh_cmake`, or forego the use of the `build/` directory, which may not be necessary anyways.
