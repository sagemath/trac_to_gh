This is the issue discussed in the comments section of the ticket [https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14708](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14708):


```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: g.set_vertex('foo', 'bar')
sage: g.get_vertices()
{}
```
We should have expected a ValueError in the `set_vertex()` method. Also, on continuing,


```
sage: g.add_vertex('foo')
sage: g.get_vertices()
{'foo': 'bar'}
```
Which shouldn't have happened

<a id='comment:4'></a>Welcome to Sagemath!

The following changes are needed in your patch:

- don't use `not self._backend.has_vertex(vertex)` but `not self.has_vertex(vertex)` or `vertex not in self`
- the error message is too long. You can reduce it as in method `delete_vertex`.
- the error message is for vertex 4 in the doctest, not 1
so you must do:

```diff
-            ValueError: vertex (1) not in the graph.
-            Please use add_vertex() method to add the vertex to the graph before setting it to the object.
+            ValueError: vertex (4) not in the graph
```
and

```diff
-        if not self._backend.has_vertex(vertex):
-            raise ValueError('vertex (%s) not in the graph.\nPlease use add_vertex() method to add the vertex to the graph before setting it to the object.'%str(vertex))
+        if vertex not in self:
+            raise ValueError('vertex (%s) not in the graph'%str(vertex))
```

---

To check that the changes you do are OK, you must run the doctests using for instance

```
sage -btp --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py
```

```
There is no need to build the graph here as we just want to show that it is not possible to set label of a non existing vertex. Running all doctests is long, so when we can illustrate an issue with a smaller/faster example, it's always better.

```diff
-            raise ValueError('vertex (%s) not in the graph'%str(vertex))
+            raise ValueError('vertex (%s) not in the graph' % str(vertex))
```
this is also PEP8.
