I need faster crystals, but I am not sure how to go about it.  Here is a first try - old:

```
sage: n = 3; r = 7; C = crystals.Spins(CartanType(["B", n])); T = crystals.TensorProduct(*[C for i in range(r)])
sage: hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
sage: %timeit [v.weight() for v in T.highest_weight_vectors()]
1 loop, best of 3: 6.52 s per loop
```
new:

```
sage: n = 3; r = 7; C = crystals.Spins(CartanType(["B", n])); T = crystals.TensorProduct(*[C for i in range(r)])
sage: hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
sage: %timeit [v.weight() for v in T.highest_weight_vectors()]
1 loop, best of 3: 4.22 s per loop
```

Removing the assertions `assert i in self.index_set()` in `spins.py` would also save some time, I don't know how useful they are.  Perhaps they can be replaced with `assert 0 < i <= rank`?

Somewhat surprisingly, a large amount of time is used in recomputing `root_system` of a Cartan type, in `weight_lattice_realization`.  I think it makes sense to cache it, but maybe I am overlooking something better.

Since `weight` is currently the worst offender, I'll try implementing a custom weight function first.

I'll keep pushing to this ticket, but leave it as `needs info` - in case anything is good to keep.

I am frequently iterating over the highest weight vectors of tensor powers.  In fact, I would prefer it to be an iterator, but that's probably asking for too much.

So I am not fully convinced of the elements having a `cartan_type`, but that is, in a way, data associated to the element. However, the weight lattice realization is definitely not. So I am -1 on caching it in the elements.

Thanks for looking into this!

I can only answer to your comment on the `highest_weight_vectors` caching: my (very minor) problem is that after computing

```
sage: C = crystals.Letters("A5")
sage: T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*14))
sage: hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
# do some stuff
sage: C = crystals.Letters("C5")
sage: T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*14))
sage: hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
# do some stuff
sage: C = crystals.Spins("B5")
sage: T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*14))
sage: hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
```
I do not know how to free the memory - and until very recently, I did not understand why my computer became unusable...

Are you saying that the highest weight vectors shouldn't take up so much space?
I just tried

```
sage: C = crystals.Letters("A5")
sage: for d in range(2, 14):
....:     T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*d))
....:     hi = T.highest_weight_vectors()
....:     print len(hi)
```
after which, according to htop, a big portion of the available memory on my laptop was used.

It is not a big problem for me, because I can do such experiments with "large" tensor powers (eg., yesterday I had to check something for `crystals.Spins(5)` with `d=16`) in a separate sage process, and not on my laptop.

By doing a cythonization, I get the following:

```
sage: C = crystals.SpinsMinus(['D',4])
sage: D = crystals.SpinsPlus(['D',4])
sage: T = tensor([C,D,C,D,C,D])
sage: T.cardinality()
262144
sage: %time for x in T: pass
CPU times: user 2.31 s, sys: 5.79 ms, total: 2.31 s
Wall time: 2.29 s
sage: %time hw = T.highest_weight_vectors()
CPU times: user 16.6 ms, sys: 135 µs, total: 16.8 ms
Wall time: 14.5 ms
sage: %time for x in T: _ = x.weight()
CPU times: user 32.9 s, sys: 34 ms, total: 33 s
Wall time: 32.9 s
sage: %time for x in T: _ = x.weight()    # with caching weight_lattice_realization()
CPU times: user 19.3 s, sys: 23.1 ms, total: 19.3 s
Wall time: 19.3 s
```
vs Sage 8.6:

```
sage: C = crystals.SpinsMinus(['D',4])
sage: D = crystals.SpinsPlus(['D',4])
sage: T = tensor([C,D,C,D,C,D])
sage: T.cardinality()
262144
sage: %time for x in T: pass
CPU times: user 5.21 s, sys: 30.5 ms, total: 5.24 s
Wall time: 5.19 s
sage: %time hw = T.highest_weight_vectors()
CPU times: user 93.4 ms, sys: 8.53 ms, total: 102 ms
Wall time: 82.5 ms
sage: %time for x in T: _ = x.weight()
> 1 minute
```

However, there is a definite memory leak with the tensor product:

```
sage: C = crystals.Letters('A5')
sage: T = tensor([C]*12)
sage: T._dummy = True
sage: del T
sage: import gc
sage: gc.collect()
sage: T = tensor([C]*12)
sage: T._dummy
True
```
I get the same when just doing for `C`. So that is one step closer to the memory leak, but that is a separate issue.

That looks wonderful!

I'll be playing with this until (something like) tomorrow!

1+1/2 immediate questions:

```
sage: C = crystals.Spins("B3")
sage: C[0].value
```
doesn't exist anymore.

1) is this intentional, should there be a deprecation?
2) I used it to identify particular elements of the crystal when it needs to be really fast.  Should I be using something else anyway?

I created #27083 for the memory leak.
