[this was reported to me by Emmanuel Thom√©]

The following never returns with Sage 8.5:

```
sage: n=16262093986406371
sage: f=ECM()
sage: f.factor(n,B1=10)
```
Note that n factors as `1009^2 * 1733 * 3023 * 3049`, with a square.

The top-level ECM.factor seems correct, and deals with exact powers.

But for some reason, the B1=10 argument is not passed to find_factors, which uses B1=2000. This is too large, and with all seeds sigma, all factors are found simultaneously, and the loop which calls find_factors loops indefinitely.

It is important to remove all small factors before calling ECM (and not only consider the size of the input).

As a rule of thumb, when using ECM with say B1=2000, all factors below B1 should have been removed.

There seem to be places where B1 is actually overridden in the glue code.

The intended semantics of e.g. `ECM(1000).factor(n, 2000)` are not very clear to me.

another issue reported by Emmanuel:

```
sage: ECM().one_curve(3808350204649, B1=400000, sigma=42)

er(42))

/home/SageMath/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/ecm.pyc in one\
_curve(self, n, factor_digits, B1, algorithm, **kwds)
    476         try:
    477             factors = self._parse_output(n, out)
--> 478             return [factors[0][0], factors[1][0]]
    479         except ValueError:
    480             # output does not end in factorization

IndexError: list index out of range
```
In this case, all prime factors are hit by the ECM curve, thus the input number is found.
The code should be modified so that if `factors` contains only one element, it should return `[ZZ(1), n]` like in the `ValueError` case.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

note: another interface to GMP-ECM exists in sage.libs.libecm:

```
sage: import sage.libs.libecm
sage: from sage.libs.libecm import ecmfactor
sage: N = 2^167 - 1
sage: ecmfactor(N, 100)
(False, None)
sage: ecmfactor(N, 100)
(True, 2349023, 17020317862377366332)
```
Maybe one could remove the one at the top-level (which uses a text interface I believe) and keep only the one in `sage.libs.libecm` (which uses a Cython interface). Comments welcome.
