I think with the latest —with-system-* options, it can and should be removed as superseded.

The branch here updated docs to make SAGE_INSTALL_GCC obsolete and
removed it everywhere, except one place. Alternative means to use
system compilers are explained.

The actual removal from the code will be done in a follow-up ticket.

I think so too, though we might need better docs on how to run `configure` with specific flags when building from source.

[This section](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#general-procedure) of the installation docs mentions it, but it assumes you're building from a released source tarball, which already contains the configure script.

Whereas when building from a git checkout, which more and more people are likely to do these days, it's necessary to at least run `make configure` first (which, while slightly unusual, is I think justifiable).

I agree that this should include the needed changes. These docs need cleaning badly, see
e.g.

```

Don't know whether we should document how to force building of GCC.
(using `--without-system-gcc`, that is).

It is still far from ideal, but already a step forward from the hugely obsolete installation docs.
