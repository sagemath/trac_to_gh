I think with the latest â€”with-system-* options, it can and should be removed as superseded.

The branch here updated docs to make SAGE_INSTALL_GCC obsolete and
removed it everywhere, except one place. Alternative means to use
system compilers are explained.

The actual removal from the code will be done in a follow-up ticket.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

I think so too, though we might need better docs on how to run `configure` with specific flags when building from source.

[This section](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html#general-procedure) of the installation docs mentions it, but it assumes you're building from a released source tarball, which already contains the configure script.

Whereas when building from a git checkout, which more and more people are likely to do these days, it's necessary to at least run `make configure` first (which, while slightly unusual, is I think justifiable).

I agree that this should include the needed changes. These docs need cleaning badly, see
e.g.

```
Building all of Sage with Clang is currently not supported, see trac ticket #12426
```
which is manifestly not true, etc.

`SAGE_INSTALL_GCC` is used for two more or less orthogonal purposes: get input from the user, and for updating the toolchain (that's where it set to/tested for `exists` value).

Refactoring this is going to be fun...

Don't know whether we should document how to force building of GCC.
(using `--without-system-gcc`, that is).

It is still far from ideal, but already a step forward from the hugely obsolete installation docs.
