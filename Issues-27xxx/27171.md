Non-binary files that are part of the sage sources and needed by the sage package at import time should be installed in the package, using `package_data` in `setup.py`.  See e.g. [#27040 comment:48](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27040#comment:48)

Why *should* it be installed like that?

I'm not against moving the specific file `sage-maxima.lisp`, but you seem to imply a more general rule here that Python packages should never access files outside of their own package (or something like that?).

That's definitely not what I'm saying, though I can see where you get the implication.

This is definitely not a rule in case of files that are not part of Sage, which may come from other packages or be overridden in some way by downstream packagers or by users.  In those cases we want an option, with some reasonable default, for where to find that file.

In this case, if I understand correctly, it's just Maxima startup code very specific to Sage's Maxima interface.  So there's no reason for it to live anywhere else outside the sage package, and that also makes the question of "where to find it" much simpler, because it's just relative to the package's installation path.  And it *certainly* doesn't belong in any `bin/`.

Did the same with `sage.gaprc` in `sage.libs.gap`.
