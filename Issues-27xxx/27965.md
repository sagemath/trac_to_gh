or rather tag it with # py2

I have no idea why this does fail only in python3. But anyway, we cannot really do anything with the snub dodecahedron currently.

This test was removed and replaced by a reasonable test using the backend normaliz.

I would say that such computation over `RDF` should not be encouraged via examples/doctests as the backend normaliz provide reasonably fast computations with algebraic numbers.

All right, sounds good!

I put the present ticket as dependancy in #25097. The ticket is essentially ready and tested, it only gets slowed due to similar conflicts/dependancies, ;) that was the reason of my reserve.
