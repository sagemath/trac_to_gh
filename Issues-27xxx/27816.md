Inspired by this ask.sagemath.org [question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46419/a-goat-in-a-tether/):

```
var("x, y, t, r_0, r_1, X", domain="real")
rr=var("rr")
assume(r_0>0,X<r_0,r_1>0,r_1<2*r_0,rr>0)
with assuming(y>0): foo=solve(x^2 + y^2 == r_0^2, y)[0].rhs()
Y_0(x)=foo
with assuming(y>0): foo=solve((r_0-x)^2 + y^2 == r_1^2, y)[0].rhs()
Y_1(x)=foo
X=solve(Y_1(x)^2==Y_0(x)^2,x)[0].rhs()
g(x)=integrate(Y_1(x),x).expand()
```

So far, so good :

```
sage: (g(X)-g(r_0-r_1)).expand()
1/4*pi*r_1^2 - 1/2*r_1^2*arcsin(1/2*r_1/r_0) - 1/8*sqrt(4*r_1^2 - r_1^4/r_0^2)*r_1^2/r_0
```

But `integrate(Y_1(x),x,r_0-r_1,X).expand()` **crashes** Maxima (and Sage) :

```
sage: integrate(Y_1(x),x,r_0-r_1,X)

;;;
;;; Detected access to protected memory, also kwown as 'bus or segmentation fault'.
;;; Jumping to the outermost toplevel prompt
;;;
```

repeated /ad nauseam/...

This can be reproduced in Maxima. This works as expected:

```
assume(r_0>0,X<r_0,r_1>0,r_1<2*r_0,rr>0);
assume(y>0);
define(Y_0(x),rhs(solve(x^2+y^2=r_0^2,y)[2]));
define(Y_1(x),rhs(solve((r_0-x)^2+y^2=r_1^2,y)[2]));
X:rhs(solve(Y_0(x)^2=Y_1(x)^2,x)[1]);
Y:Y_0(X);
define(g(x),expand(integrate(Y_1(x),x)));
g(X)-g(r_0-r_1);
```
But asking for `integrate(Y_1(x),x,r_0-r_1,X);` **crashes** Maxima with the same error messages...

This seems different from bugs already reported on definite integration.

FWIW, both `giac` and `fricas` give acceptable answers (different in their integration process : one uses `arcsin`, the other `arctan`, with similar geometric interpretation...).

Keywords: definite integral

Upstream: Not yet reported upstream; Will do shortly.

This is still true in 8.8.beta7, which has maxima 5.42.2...

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
