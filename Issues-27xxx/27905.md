```
Sage version:
SageMath version 8.7, Release Date: 2019-03-23

Minimal reproducible example:

```python
%typeset_mode True
var("k1,k2,k3,k4,a1,b1,c1,d1") # Let's define some parameters
R.<p,q> = SR[] # Variables of the polynomial
poly= (c1*k1)*p*q + (c1*k2 + a1)*p + (c1*k3 + b1)*q + c1*k4 + d1 # Simple bilinear function in p and q
poly.subs(p=var("alpha")) # ---> Shows correct substitution
poly.subs(p=var("gamma",latex_name=r"\color{blue}{\gamma}", domain="real")) # ---> Shows incorrect substitution
# BUT
print(poly.subs(p=var("gamma",latex_name=r"\color{blue}{\gamma}", domain="real"))) # ---> Shows CORRECT substitution
```

It is a bug while showing the polynomial, but not while substituting because the print() shows the correct result.
