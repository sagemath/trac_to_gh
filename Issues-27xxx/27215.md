The environment variable `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` has always been a bit of a hack. It is currently broken (probably due to #24919): imagine a system where the `gcc` Sage package is installed. If `mpir` is upgraded, then `mpir` is rebuilt (as dependency of `gcc`) with `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` but there is nothing forcing a second build of `mpir` without `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`.

Instead of trying to fix `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`, we just stop supporting it: toolchain packages are now built once just like any other package.

It doesn't even explain the defect.  Just "it breaks".  What breaks? How?  How does this fix it? Is there anything this fix breaks?

With all due respect, I think that this explanation from the ticket description is more than just "it breaks":

If you have more concrete questions, I'm happy to answer them.
