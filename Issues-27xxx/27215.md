The environment variable `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` has always been a bit of a hack. It is currently broken (probably due to #24919): imagine a system where the `gcc` Sage package is installed. If `mpir` is upgraded, then `mpir` is rebuilt (as dependency of `gcc`) with `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` but there is nothing forcing a second build of `mpir` without `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`.

Instead of trying to fix `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN`, we just stop supporting it: toolchain packages are now built once just like any other package.

Yes, as explained in the ticket description. That's also why it's a blocker ticket: it breaks builds whenever the Sage GCC package is installed.

With all due respect, I think that this explanation from the ticket description is more than just "it breaks":

> imagine a system where the `gcc` Sage package is installed. If `mpir` is upgraded, then `mpir` is rebuilt (as dependency of `gcc`) with `SAGE_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` but there is nothing forcing a second build of `mpir`.


If you have more concrete questions, I'm happy to answer them.
