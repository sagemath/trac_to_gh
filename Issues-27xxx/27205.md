When sage uses pkgconfig to determine compile flags, for example in `src/module_list.py` and `src/sage/env.py` it only extracts the "libraries" but not the "libs" field from pkg-config. In the case of fflas-ffpack this field (as well as cflags) contains `-fopenmp`. So sage builds but does not link with this flag which leads to missing symbols on Ubuntu:

```
ImportError: /<<PKGBUILDDIR>>/debian/build/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_sparse.so: undefined symbol: GOMP_loop_ull_runtime_start
```

This was mentioned in https://bugs.debian.org/919573 .

To reproduce:

```
  tox -e docker-debian-bullseye-standard
```
The resulting sage crashes on startup with the above error.

Applying the Debian patch reveals another Sage bug:

```
$ pkg-config --libs linbox
-L/sage/local/lib -llinbox @LINBOXSAGE_LIBS@ -lntl -lmpfr -liml -lflint -fopenmp -lblas -llapack -lgivaro -lgmp -lgmpxx
```
This is linbox upstream issue https://github.com/linbox-team/linbox/pull/170

This ticket fixes both.

I created this patch which takes care of the extra flags only for linbox and fflas-ffpack for now:

https://salsa.debian.org/science-team/sagemath/blob/master/debian/patches/u1-pkgconfig-extra-link-flags.patch

To apply it here, should I do the same for all modules that use pkgconfig in env.py and module_list.py?
