I first tried something a little more complicated: first computing the minimal spanning tree, and if that raises an error, then do the stuff in this branch. That was not much faster; I tested on `simplicial_complexes.PoincareHomologyThreeSphere()` which has integers as vertices.

So I think there is a problem with this that is exposing another problem with `graph()`. Mainly if the result of `graph()` is an immutatble graph, then doing `G.copy()` will give another immutable.

```sage
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(3)
sage: GI = G.copy(immutable=True)
sage: G.is_immutable()
False
sage: GI.is_immutable()
True
sage: C = GI.copy()
sage: C.is_immutable()   # This is the problem
True
sage: C.relabel({0:'a',1:'b',2:'c'})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
...
ValueError: To relabel an immutable graph use inplace=False
```
The result of `graph()` should be an immutable graph because it is cached, which can be easily achieved when constructing the result by giving `immutable=True` as an argument. To fix the problem here, you should do `G.copy(immutable=False)`.

I would also think it would be faster to use `v_to_int` to construct `int_to_v` than redoing `enumerate(G.vertex_iterator())` because of `int_to_v` being a Python builtin type (a `dict`).

I would also change the test to be more indicative of the cyclic structure:

```
-            sage: (x**5).is_one()
-            True
+            sage: [(x**n).is_one() for n in range(1,6)]
+            [False, False, False, False, True]
```

Thanks for the comments. I made those changes, plus a few others along these lines:

```diff
             True
         """
         d = self._vertex_to_index
-        return {d[v]:v for v in d}
+        return {idx: v for v, idx in d.items()}
 
     def _chomp_repr_(self):
         r"""
```
The point is that instead of doing a lot of separate dictionary lookups, it should be faster to dump it once using `items` and then convert that to a dict.

A bit of the downside of doing `foo.items()` is that it creates the whole list in Python2. So it is not so memory friendly. Anyways, just food for thought.

Yes, we can fix the `graph()` issue on another ticket.

If the patchbot comes back green, then this can be set to a positive review.

It's a tradeoff between time and memory. Fortunately, I don't think simplicial complexes are likely to have so many vertices where it is an issue, or if they do, it's not going to be practical to compute the fundamental group.

(For example, `simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(7,2)` has over a million simplices overall, but just 21 vertices.)

`gens` doesn't get used much, only in these two lines:

```
        if len(gens) == 0:
            return gap.TrivialGroup()
        ...
        gens_dict = {frozenset(g): i for i, g in enumerate(gens)}
        FG = FreeGroup(len(gens), 'e')
```
So I don't think it will make much difference if it is made up of tuples or frozensets.
