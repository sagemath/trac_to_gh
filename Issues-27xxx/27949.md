It is currently clumsy to create a subfield of a finite field using subfields() method.

```
sage: k = GF(2^21)
sage: k.subfields(3)
[(Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3, Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
    To:   Finite Field in z21 of size 2^21
    Defn: z3 |--> z21^20 + z21^19 + z21^17 + z21^15 + z21^11 + z21^9 + z21^8 + z21^6 + z21^2)]
sage: K, _ = k.subfields(3)[0]
sage: K
Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
```

With the patch of this ticket, we have subfield() method such that

```
sage: k = GF(2^21)
sage: k.subfield(3)
Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
sage: K = _
sage: k.coerce_map_from(K)
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
  To:   Finite Field in z21 of size 2^21
  Defn: z3 |--> z21^20 + z21^19 + z21^17 + z21^15 + z21^11 + z21^9 + z21^8 + z21^6 + z21^2
```

Then it would look like

```
-        return [self.subfields(m, name=name[m])[0] for m in divisors]
+
+        pairs = []
+        for m in divisors:
+            K =  self.subfield(m, name=name[m])

It is somewhat duplicating the code above. Is this better?
