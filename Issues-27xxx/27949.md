It is currently clumsy to create a subfield of a finite field using subfields() method.

```
sage: k = GF(2^21)
sage: k.subfields(3)
[(Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3, Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
    To:   Finite Field in z21 of size 2^21
    Defn: z3 |--> z21^20 + z21^19 + z21^17 + z21^15 + z21^11 + z21^9 + z21^8 + z21^6 + z21^2)]
sage: K, _ = k.subfields(3)[0]
sage: K
Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
```

With the patch of this ticket, we have subfield() method such that

```
sage: k = GF(2^21)
sage: k.subfield(3)
Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
sage: K = _
sage: k.coerce_map_from(K)
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in z3 of size 2^3
  To:   Finite Field in z21 of size 2^21
  Defn: z3 |--> z21^20 + z21^19 + z21^17 + z21^15 + z21^11 + z21^9 + z21^8 + z21^6 + z21^2
```

Then it would look like

```
-        return [self.subfields(m, name=name[m])[0] for m in divisors]
+
+        pairs = []
+        for m in divisors:

+            pairs.append( (K, self.coerce_map_from(K)) )
+        return pairs
```

It is somewhat duplicating the code above. Is this better?

Maybe. It seems less wasteful in terms of object creation and it is not too much code duplication. Plus, the current version almost seems to to go against the new method; although I guess not exactly from what you're saying.
