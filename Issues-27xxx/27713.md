There are some bits in plain GMP not present for some reason in MPIR such that Cygwin gets some configure-time flags set differently than the defaults on Linux.  Cygwin's system package for GMP is configured with these different defaults, leading to a build failure in pynac that I don't get on other platforms.

See the upstream PR for more details: https://github.com/pynac/pynac/pull/342
