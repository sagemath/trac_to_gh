Calling the tab completion of the Mathematica interface like `mathematica.[TAB]` causes Sage to crash.

The error is a `UnicodeDecodeError` in the IPython interpreter. Some of the Mathematica keywords involve Unicode characters which do not seem to be correctly encoded. For example:

```
sage: s = mathematica._tab_completion()[-1]; s
'\xef\x8e\xaf'
sage: type(s)
<type 'str'>
```

This was tested using Sage 8.7, Python 2 and Mathematica 11.3 on Linux. The crash report is attached.

Apparently this is part of a larger problem â€“ support for unicode in this and other interfaces. See also #24268. In Python 3, the problem above does not seem to exist. I am not sure how to make this work in Python 2.
