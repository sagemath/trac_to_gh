Thank you for such a fast review.

You're right about syntax sugar, it doesn't worth to add it only for one case, so I've deleted it. If someone will really need it, someone will create a ticket.

Fixed all the problems you spotted, I hope.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Thank you. It is looking much better. Here are some additional comments:

Anytime you have normal text after `EXAMPLES::`, it should be `EXAMPLES:`, e.g.,

```diff
-EXAMPLES::
+EXAMPLES:
 
 The following example demonstrates a monoid creation ::
```
You will also want to remove the space before the `::` so Sphinx adds the colon `:` to the end of the output sentence.

`AUTHORS::` -> `AUTHORS:` (it is not a special block nor is their code after it)

Please use the standard copyright header in Sage (see, e.g., `algebras/weyl_algebra.py`)

```diff
-        EXAMPLES::
+        EXAMPLES:
 
-            Get the normal form ::
+        Get the normal form::
```

Change the name of `lexic_norm_form` to either the standard shortening `lex_normal_form` or fully spelled out `lexicographic_normal_form` (note the fully spelled out `normal` too).
I am also not sure I like the `while True:` loop in there as there seems to be more standard ways to write that logic (where the main condition is the `while`-loop condition.

Similar for `foata_norm_form`.

This seem complicated:

```
        repeated_el_iter = (repeat(e, times) for e, times in self._element_list)
        return list(chain.from_iterable(repeated_el_iter))
```
Can you just do it using a list comprehension? (e.g., `[foo(bar) for bar in B]`)

Why do you need the `next_front` map in `min_hasse_diagram`?

A `TraceMonoid` is not a `FreeMonoid`, so I do not think it should inherit from `FreeMonoid`. Also, can you justify why we should add this instead of expanding the right-angled Artin group code? I understand this is to be the monoid version of that, but I still expend a lot of commonomalities.

`_repr_` and `_latex_` do not have any docstrings/doctests.
