}
```
Keywords: BooleanMonomial, monomial, equality

Demonstration:

```
sage: P.<x> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: list(P(1))
[1]
sage: list(P(1))[0]
1
sage: list(P(1))[0] == 1
False
sage: type(list(P(1))[0])
<type 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanMonomial'>
```

Note that this behavior is inconsistent with the behavior for polynomial rings over finite fields:

```
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(GF(2))
sage: list(R(1))[0] == 1
True
```

In the context of converting polynomials to lists, this has [understandably caused confusion for at least one user on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44880/sage-not-detecting-intergers-in-boolean-polynomial-ring/).

Part of the problem is that `BooleanMonomialMonoid` is a **monoid** and not a **ring**.

So there cannot be a coercion from `ZZ` to the `BooleanMonomialMonoid`. There could be a coercion to the common parent `P` but that requires a pushout construction...

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
