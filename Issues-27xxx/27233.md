The following calculation runs "forever":

```
sage: g = QQbar(-27/4)^(1/7)
sage: (nf, elems, mor) = number_field_elements_from_algebraics([sqrt(2), sqrt(-1), g])
sage: nf3.<n> = NumberField(nf.polynomial(), embedding=mor(nf.0))
sage: QQbar(-1/108*n^12) == -g
```

A fast path in qqbar.py's `cmp_elements_with_same_minpoly` should trigger but doesn't.

Keywords: **algebraic field**

Component: **algebra**
