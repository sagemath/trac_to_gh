```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 1); t = R.gen()
sage: (t/2) * vector([1,2])
```
results in a

```
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Multivariate Polynomial Ring in t over Rational Field' and 'Ambient free module of rank 2 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring'
```

Interestingly, for a "true" univariate polynomial ring it works:

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't'); t = R.gen()
sage: (t/2) * vector([1,2])
(1/2*t, t)
```
Also for a multivariate polynomial ring in more than one variable it works:

```
sage: sage: R = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 2); t = R.gen()
....: sage: (t/2) * vector([1,2])
```

This issue was raised by the following doctest in sage.geometry.polyhedron.base, method `integrate`, ticket #27365:

```
        Integral over a non full-dimensional polytope::

            sage: x, y = polygens(QQ, 'x, y')
            sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0],[1,1]])
            sage: P.integrate(x*y)    # optional - latte_int
            0
            sage: P.integrate(x*y, measure='induced')    # optional - latte_int  # not tested (see :trac:`27364`)
```

The current branch patches `__call__` so that `_coerce_` is not called that often. #25558 might change everything, but this seems somehow more out of reach.

Nevertheless, this code for caching 0 and 1 does make things a bit faster.
On my machine, `%time R.gen(0) + S.gen(0)` gives 9.6 s, but taking out the caching it's 12.6 s.

Above the action of `ZZ[x,y,z]` on `ZZ(x)[y]` is `ZZ(x)[y,z]` in both situations. However, I think that the `ZZ(x)` **must not** change. It would be good to test this pushout with `ZZ(x)` in different forms

- univariate NTL `PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', implementation='NTL')`
- multivariate `PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x'], 1))`.

In this second example it is unclear what is best.

The action of `QQ[x,y]` on `ZZ[This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` does correctly produce `QQ[y][This is the Trac macro *x* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x-macro)` in both situations.

<a id='comment:26'></a>Related: it is desirable that the string representation of multivariate polynomial rings make visible the implementation. Currently we have

```
sage: PolynomialRing(ZZ, ['x', 'y'], 2, implementation='generic')
