By #13447, polynomial rings can be garbage collected. However, they cannot if its elements were involved in an arithmetic operation. So, apparently some strong reference chain is created in the coercion system.

The purpose of this ticket is to find that reference chain and invent means to remove it. Perhaps related with #26811?


Depends on #13447

Here is verification that in principle polynomial rings can be garbage collected:

```
sage: n = 0
sage: import gc
sage: while 1:
....:     if n%100 == 0: print(get_memory_usage())
....:     R = QQ['a{}'.format(n), 'b{}'.format(n)]
....:     p = R.1
....:     del R, p
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     n += 1
....:     
7332.671875
7332.671875
7332.671875
7332.671875
7332.671875
7332.671875
...
```
And here is evidence that they cannot if an arithmetic operation occurs. I am studying different operations, each time in a new session, just to be on the safe side:

1. Scalar multiplication:

   ```
   sage: n = 0
   sage: import gc
   sage: while 1:
   ....:     if n%100 == 0: print(get_memory_usage())
   ....:     R = QQ['a{}'.format(n), 'b{}'.format(n)]
   ....:     p = 2*R.1
   ....:     del R, p
   ....:     _ = gc.collect()
   ....:     n += 1
   ....:     
   7332.6640625
   7333.6640625
   7333.9140625
   7334.04296875
   7334.04296875
   7334.04296875
   7334.04296875
   ...
   ```
   --> Interestingly, after an increase, the memory consumption remains steady.
2. Addition

   ```
   sage: n = 0
   sage: import gc
   sage: while 1:
   ....:     if n%100 == 0: print(get_memory_usage())
   ....:     R = QQ['a{}'.format(n), 'b{}'.format(n)]
   ....:     p = R.1+R.0
   ....:     del R, p
   ....:     _ = gc.collect()
   ....:     n += 1
   ....:     
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   7340.65625
   ...
   ```
   --> No leak here.
3. Multiplication

   ```
   sage: n = 0
   sage: import gc
   sage: while 1:
   ....:     if n%100 == 0: print(get_memory_usage())
   ....:     R = QQ['a{}'.format(n), 'b{}'.format(n)]
   ....:     p = R.1*R.0
   ....:     del R, p
   ....:     _ = gc.collect()
   ....:     n += 1
   ....:     
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   7332.6328125
   ...
   ```
   --> No leak.

So, apparently the leak occurs in the action of the base ring on the polynomial ring.

See #27083 . Increasing memory usage that flattens off is not an indication of a memory leak. It may even be the case (if `CachedRepresentation` gets used) that objects remain in memory without apparent reason due to its recently acquired strong reference cache.
