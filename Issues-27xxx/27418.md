The goal of the present ticket is to add code for computing with higher derivations and completions of global function fields.

Some comments:

`FunctionFieldHigherDerivation.__init__` is missing a doctest (add a `TestSuite(foo).run()` here `;)`, if something is failing, add a `skip="_test_failed"` or `skip=["_test_failed", "_test_failure"]`).

Same for `FunctionFieldHigherDerivation_rational`.

I think you should include a definition of the Cartier operation (unless this is something anyone who has ever learned about function fields will know about it; pardon my ignorance here)?

In `_pth_root`, I would avoid the import `from .element import FunctionFieldElement_rational` as this can really slow things down more than you expect (in my experience). If you need to put it in the method because of circular imports, then I would instead make it a `lazy_import`.

This seems like the better (i.e., faster) way to do it instead of dividing by `x.derivative() in the lambda function:

```
xderinv = ~(x.derivative())
derivative = lambda f: xderinv * f.derivative()
```

I am not sure this comparison `if prec < infinity:` for `prec=None` will always work on Python3. So I think you are better changing the order of the tests to be

```python
if prec is None or prec == infinity:
    raise NotImplementedErorr
# continue with init
```

---

Some nitpicks:

`R(0)` -> `R.zero()` (unless you expect `R` to be a Python type like `int`, but I don't see that happening here).

Micro-optimization for when the basis is empty:

```diff
+        if not basis:
+            return [],[]
         d = len(basis)
-
-        if d == 0:
-            return [],[]
```

The one-line sentence for `completion()` is missing a period/full-stop.

```diff
-Return i-th derivative of f with respect to the separating element.
+Return ``i``-th derivative of ``f`` with respect to the separating element.
```

I think doing `pth_root = self._pth_root` obfuscates the code at little bit. I doubt that one additional indirection matters that much for speed (but maybe I am wrong).

A little more clarity on the message:

```diff
-raise NotImplementedError('not yet supported')
+raise NotImplementedError('exact results not yet supported')
```

Instead of checking `while len(gaps) < g:`, you could instead decrement `g` when adding to `gaps` and test `while g:`. This should be faster.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

So why the pickling isn't working is this:

```
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(GF(2))
sage: d = F.higher_derivation()
sage: d.__reduce__()
(<built-in function unpickle_map>,
 (<class 'sage.rings.function_field.maps.FunctionFieldHigherDerivation_rational'>,
  Set of Homomorphisms from Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2 to Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
  {'_field': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_p': 2,
   '_pth_root_in_finite_field': <function <lambda> at 0x7f01f807f230>,
   '_separating_element': x},
  {'_codomain': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_domain': Rational function field in x over Finite Field of size 2,
   '_is_coercion': False,
   '_repr_type_str': None}))
```
The lambda function cannot be pickled. This was indicated by trying to do

```
sage: dumps(d)
...
PicklingError: Can't pickle <type 'function'>: attribute lookup __builtin__.function failed
```
So the simple solution would be to remove `_pth_root_in_finite_field` and just inline the checks. I did that, but then the pickling still failed because equality was not implemented.

Thus, hat I would suggest doing is making these `Map` classes also inherit from `UniqueRepresentation`. I don't think this will introduce any reference cycles (i.e., a memory leak) considering your input parameter is just the `field`.

I already have done both.

I also have tried this :-) But adding `UniqueRepresentation` also raises an exception complaining of multiple metaclasses...

What you need to do is use is the metaclass that is a combination of the two being passed:

```
from six import with_metaclass
from sage.structure.unique_representation import UniqueRepresentation
from sage.misc.inherit_comparison import InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass
class FunctionFieldDerivation(with_metaclass(InheritComparisonClasscallMetaclass, UniqueRepresentation, Map)):
```
With the appropriate change, I get the pickling test to pass.

Done, but I made some changes as efforts to pass the tests.

Done. I could use `.element_class`

Note that `None < infinity` is `True`. If `prec` is `None`, a default precision is used. 

I plan to (but did not yet) support `prec=infinity` for infinite precision, once after #27347 (lazy laurent series) is merged.

Done.

Fixed.

Right. I removed these evil optimizations.

Done. It is now `infinite precision is not yet supported`.

Good idea. Done.

Thank you. I also got rid of some code duplication. Personally, I think what we should do is add a `pth_root` method to a prime field to get rid of this hack. Anyways, this will work for now as that should be on a separate ticket.

Ah, right. However, this is something that should be addressed because there is no guarantee that this will remain this way (or not raise an error). So I have changed it to be what should be equivalent code (as `None == infinity` should always return `False`).

I also made a few other trivial tweaks for PEP8. If my changes are good, then you can set a positive review.
