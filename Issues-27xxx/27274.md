<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

This seems to come from the fact that `find_local_maximum` uses `numpy.float64` values as the function arguments (instead of Sage reals), and these are unacceptable to `log` when `log` is given a second argument:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: log(numpy.float64(0.5))
-0.69314718055994529
sage: log(numpy.float64(0.5), 3)
<BOOM>
```

I suggest double-fixing the problem by making both `log` more robust, as well as fixing `find_local_maximum` so it gives Sage reals_to the function as according to the principle of least surprise.
