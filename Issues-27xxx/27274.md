This seems to come from the fact that `find_local_maximum` uses `numpy.float64` values as the function arguments (instead of Sage reals), and these are unacceptable to `log` when `log` is given a second argument:

```
sage: import numpy
sage: log(numpy.float64(0.5))
-0.69314718055994529
sage: log(numpy.float64(0.5), 3)
<BOOM>
```

I suggest double-fixing the problem by making both `log` more robust, as well as fixing `find_local_maximum` so it gives Sage reals_to the function as according to the principle of least surprise.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
