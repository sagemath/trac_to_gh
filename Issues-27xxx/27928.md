Long time ago, we tried to implement the linear time algorithm for LexBFS, but it's not finalized. See #11736. It could give you some ideas. At least a working and clean LexBFS is a great improvement.


Some comments:

- You should let a brief description of the algorithm and add a reference in `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`

```diff
-        This algorithm maintains for each vertex left in the graph a code
-        corresponding to the vertices already removed. The vertex of maximal
-        code (according to the lexicographic order) is then removed, and the
-        codes are updated.
+        The algorithm used is described in
+        `this <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krueger/papers/unified.ps>`_ by
+        Derek G. Corneil and Richard Krueger.
```

- no need for this empty line

```diff
+
+        nV = self.order()
```

- unless I missed something

```diff
-            edges = [(id_inv[i], id_inv[pred[i]]) for i in range(self.order()) if pred[i] != -1]
+            edges = [(id_inv[i], id_inv[pred[i]]) for i in range(nV) if pred[i] != -1]
```

- instead of lambda, it might be better to use a def

```diff
         l = lambda x: code[x]
+        def l(x):
+            return code[x]
```


- in `lex_DFS`, instead of defining `add_element = (lambda y: value.append(id_inv[y])) if not reverse else (lambda y: value.insert(0, id_inv[y]))`, you should always do `value.append(id_inv[y])` and after the while loop reverse the list if `reverse` is true. Indeed, inserting at the beginning of a list is costly.

- in the code, is it possible to insert at the end of the list and use a different comparison function ? I'm not sure it is a good idea. At least think about it.

- I did not check carefully if the 3-sun graph is already defined in our graph constructors...

- both methods are defined in `generic_graph.py`. What happen if `self` is directed ?

I don't think that a directed graph can cause any problem. The algorithm should work for both directed and undirected graphs.

which method ?

> What we could do now is just convert our graph to a boost graph, get its adjacency list and then run the linear time algorithm for both Lex BFS and Lex DFS. Should I proceed to the creation of this method in `generic_graph_pyx`?

If you use boost, the best is certainly to add the method to `boost_graph.pyx`

Method `edge_list()` in  `boost_interface.cpp`. It doesn't directly return the adjacency list but we can create it easily from the edge list. I  am not sure however whether or not it is more efficient to do this rather than building it directly from the sage graph.

Unfortunately, the current lex BFS method does not work with DiGraphs, the reason being that to get the neighbors of a vertex `v` it examines the `v-th` **column** of the adjacency matrix whereas it should examine the `v-th` **row**.

It's never bas to have 2 methods, even if very similar, to check the correctness of the new one.

In the `Cython code`:
- instead of creating `adjacency_list` with `vector`, you could use static sparse graphs. See for instance in `distances_all_pairs.pyx`
- the test `if nV == 0:` should be done before feeding other data structures
- `cdef dict int_to_v = dict(enumerate(G))` -> `cdef list int_to_v = list(G)`
- `cdef u_int, v_int` -> `cdef int u_int, v_int`
- for `pred`, why not using an integer array instead of a list ?

May be we should create a new file names `graph_traversals.pyx` to host lexBFS, lexDFS, lexM, etc.

The original code I see uses the adjacency matrix I mentioned and does not work for directed graphs. The version I have is 8.8.beta4. Maybe the code was patched in a newer beta release?\\

\\
Will do.\\

When all of these methods are created I will add them to this new file.

I have edited the code and pushed to a new branch in `public/` so that we can both edit it.

More precisely, I did the following
- rebase on `8.9.beta1`

- in `generic_graph_pyx.pxd`, remove (no longer needed here)

```diff
+from libcpp.vector cimport vector
+
+
```
- in `generic_graph_pyx.pyx`, remove 

```diff
+import collections
```

- in `generic_graph.py`: use alias to methods instead of extra frontend method. It's shorter and more efficient this way.

- in `traversals.pyx`
  - change file header, add table of methods and copyright
  - extend one line description of methods
  - put proper bibliographic reference
  - add missing deallocation of short digraph
  - make the graph simple if it allows loops or multiple edges.  In general, **DO NOT MODIFY INPUT GRAPH**. This is strictly forbidden ! Either we raise an error, or use `to_simple` to make a copy without loop/multiedges. Here, instead of checking if the graph effectively has loops or multiedges, I directly make a copy. I think it's more efficient like that, but may be not...


What remains to be done:
- add tests for corner case (empty (di)graph, etc.)
- try other (di)graphs, in particular a symmetric digraph to check if it's working well
- Check if further improvements are possible
- BFS and DFS are iterators. Can't we turn LexBFS and LexDFS to iterators as well ? it might not be possible when `reverse=True`.

I have a doubt on the use of memset. I might be wrong, but I think you fill each byte of each integer of array pred with -1. A for loop might be safer here, no ?

Also:

```diff
-        for i in range (0, out_degree(sd, v)):
+        for i in range(0, out_degree(sd, v)):
```

As `lex_BFS` is exposed in `Graph`, there is no need for this change

```diff
-        sage: Graph(1).lex_BFS(tree=True)
+        sage: from sage.graphs.traversals import lex_BFS
+        sage: lex_BFS(Graph(1), tree=True)
```
So you should use `G.lex_BFS()` and `G.lex_DFS()` in all doctests.

For the test with symmetric digraph, you can do:

```
G = Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
D = DiGraph(G)
G.lex_BFS() == D.lex_DFS()
```
