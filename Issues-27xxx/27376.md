Attachment: **[Base class for polyhedra â€” Sage Reference Manual v8.6: Combinatorial and Discrete Geometry.html.gz](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket27376/81eab94209f46355f386d2283f022850.gz)**

I have attached the modified file to this ticket as I couldn't find the location of the file in the [GitHub](../wiki/GitHub) repository.

I have modified the document to not only serve the need but also to give it a better structure. Though the contribution is meager, I have done his to familiarize with the Trac system.
