Actually, I have spotted the bug (2, in fact) in the readline source. 

* The first is in the macro [BASH_CHECK_LIB_TERMCAP](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/tree/aclocal.m4?h=devel#n951)  in readline's `aclocal.m4` (this is not an autogenerated file, it's hand-written). If `--with-curses` is given to `./configure` then it still first checks `libtermcap`, and if it's installed on the system then `libtinfo` is skipped. After fixing this, one sees `-ltinfo` in `TERMCAP_LIB` variable, as it should be.
 
* It's not enough to fix the above, as `TERMCAP_LIB` is only used on cygwin/mingw, for a reason I fail to comprehend. Setting [SHLIB_LIBS](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/tree/support/shobj-conf?h=devel#n45) to `'$(TERMCAP_LIB)'` unconditionally seems to be the right thing.

The thing works on OSX as there there is an unconditional `SHLIB_LIBS='-lncurses'`.

Should this be reported upstream?

No, it's readline's "not overlinking" (I'd rather call it "blatant underlinking)
policy, plus "always try termcap first", see
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2014-04/msg00024.html
(underlinking is very bad IMHO, it potentially means that a wrong termcap lib is used, resulting in all sorts of hiccups).

I just sent a followup there, but I don't have much hope for accepting this as bugs on upstream side.
