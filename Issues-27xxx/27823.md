In general the iconv SPKG is not even required.  It's not installed (or rather, a dummy empty package is installed) for any platforms except Cygwin, HP-UX, and Solaris.

The requirement for it on Cygwin is probably outdated--iconv is a standard library on almost all Cygwin installations, and is surely more up-to-date than when this SPKG was first added in #8567.  Support for the other two platforms has not been maintained much.

We can add a configure-time check for it, and treat it as a dummy package in most cases.

there is a cryptic 

```
    # Disable NLS on Cygwin to be able to build libiconv without the Cygwin
    # libiconv package.
```
I presume the latter line should be "NLS package", no ?

Does this mean that the Cygwin's "native" libiconv does not work?

According to #13912, that `--disable-nls` on Cygwin was dictated by the desire to reduce the number of Cygwin deps.
I think it can be scrapped.

using AM_ICONV (a bit of a hack).
Needs config.rpath from gettext. (I also saw packages just creating an empty config.rpath, so perhaps we can do this too).

Does this work on Cygwin?

For the `config.rpath` stuff, it seems that file is included with gettext, typically under `/usr/share/gettext/config.rpath`.  Normally it is installed by `gettextize`, but I don't think we actually want to run that, since we really just want the file; we don't want to prepare the program for direct use of gettext.

I wonder if there's a reasonably reliable way to just get the path to this file...

Are you saying you're trying to get it so you can run configure without the macros from gettext?  The thing about `config.rpath` is that it's not a macro; it's just a file that needs to be copied into place.  automake and the like don't do this automatically for the most part.

that's correct, all of this is just to use AM_ICONV.
On OSX iconv is provided by the system, no need for gettext (or iconv) implementation; however AM_ICONV is a part of gettext package, and has several deps there, that need to be installed (and some of these deps need `config.rpath` script installed into the right place).

I think this mostly just comes down to a misconfiguration on many distributions.

automake has a "libdir" that it searches for these generated files that it copies into your project.  For example on my system my automake libdir is `/usr/share/automake-1.14` in which I have I have:

```
$ ls -l /usr/share/automake-1.14
total 512
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 26  2016 am
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   5826 Jan  2  2014 ar-lib
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   4096 May 26  2016 Automake
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   7333 Jan  2  2014 compile
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     20 Jan  2  2014 config.guess -> ../misc/config.guess
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     18 Jan  2  2014 config.sub -> ../misc/config.sub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35147 Jan  2  2014 COPYING

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  13997 Jan  2  2014 install-sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   6047 Jan  2  2014 mdate-sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   6872 Jan  2  2014 missing
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   3538 Jan  2  2014 mkinstalldirs
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4670 Jan  2  2014 py-compile
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  15285 Jan  2  2014 tap-driver.pl
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  19464 Jan  2  2014 tap-driver.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4287 Jan  2  2014 test-driver
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 323102 Jan  2  2014 texinfo.tex
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   6858 Jan  2  2014 ylwrap
```

As you can see, the commonly used `config.guess` and `config.sub` are actually symlinks to `/usr/misc`.  It turns out on my system these files are not even provided by automake, but rather a package called `autotools-dev`.

For this to work properly the distro ought to be creating a symlink `/usr/share/automake-1.14/config.rpath -> ../gettext/config.rpath`.

But they don't, so it doesn't get installed properly.

on my gentoo box I have `/usr/share/gettext/config.rpath`, yet it does not get picked up, i.e. if I remove the copying of `config.rpath` from bootstrap I get

```
$ ./bootstrap

Apparently it has to installed:

Naturally, on a box with gettext and autoconf installed none of these *.m4 files in this branch are needed, but `config.path` still is needed.

ok, so this works without gettext installed (some funny thing with the return code, I return 779 and receive 11)
