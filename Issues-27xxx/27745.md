The `lrslib` issue with `openmpi` is fixed (self-tests pass).

If i do `export MAKE='make -j4'` before running `sage -i -f polymake`, the compilation still eats all my CPU, though `spkg-install.in` relies on `sdh_make`.

Also, i have 6G free on my machine, and the compilation ends up with a `No space left on device`. How much disk space is required to build and install `polymake` ?

During build, `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` is actually initialized from the MAKE setting.
See `build/bin/sage-build-num-threads` and `build/make/install`.

The correct way to install an optional package is, of course,

```
eval ./configure $(./config.status --config) --enable-jupymake && make build

Thanks. Well that requires root access, but I guess we have a nice IT so they'll do it.

That sage itself can be just installed without root access is a wonderful thing... (But they also have installed the generated list of recommended packages for me, which makes things a lot faster.)

I was able to build both packages (thank you Matthias for your help with this). However, there are issues with `interfaces/polymake.py` (make sure you run `sage -tp --optional=sage,polymake`). The biggest issue is that it doesn't even finish evaluating the first doctest:

```
polymake.eval('print foo;')
```
It timed out after running for 5 minutes.

I tried running this directly in my Sage shell, which it is still taking seemingly forever. I also tried `C = polymake('cube(3)')`, which after I hit ctrl-c, any additional attempt to run the interface results in multiple errors of the form:

```
TypeError: argument should be integer or bytes-like object, not 'str'
```

Is this an issue with the interface? Is this something with polymake trying to do something for the first time? Something else?

The branch just has one commit that cleans up the interface file a bit.

jupymake can't be a dependency of polymake because it depends on polymake

Here's how to debug this:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.polymake import PolymakeExpect
sage: polymake = PolymakeExpect(logfile="POLYMAKE.log")
sage: polymake.rand_sphere(4, 20, seed=5)
```

Then, in a separate terminal, use `tail -f POLYMAKE.log`

in `sage.interfaces.polymake` we have both `polymake_expect` and `polymake_jupymake` so which one is used in `polytopes.cube(backend='polymake')`?

How to tell `sage` I always want `polymake_jupymake` for every `something(backend='polymake')`?

I believe the issue with `_test_lawrence()` is numerical instability. Consider

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(-1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)], backend='polymake')
sage: from sage.misc.prandom import randint 
sage: v = p.vertices()[randint(0, p.n_vertices()-1)].vector()
sage: Q = p.lawrence_extension(2*v - p.center())
sage: R = p.lawrence_extension(2.0*v - p.center())
```
Using floating point numbers seems to lead to issues with the conversion back and forth as

```
sage: Q.Hrepresentation()

 An inequality (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) x + 0.0 >= 0)
```
This agrees with the backend information created from polymake, but how the faces are computed in Sage are different:

```
sage: Q.facets()                                                                                          
(A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices)
sage: R.facets()                                                                                          
(A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices,)
```
which is based off `R.combinatorial_polyhedron()`. In particular, if we try

```
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
...
ValueError: not all facets are joins of vertices
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
```

---
Based off this, what I would do is explicitly skip the test and state that it is a known issue with numerical instability. I am not sure what else we can do about fixing it at this point `:/`.

No, the failure in `_test_lawrence` shows up both for the `PolymakeExpect` and for the `PolymakeJupymake` interface.

`PolymakeExpect` has additional failures, which I do not know how to fix.

I wouldn't say it fully explains it, but it at least gives an indication about what is going on. It definitely doesn't provide a fix, which should eventually be IMO (but not on this ticket).

Well it works well except for all doctests in `interfaces/polymake.py` involing `PolymakeExpect`. Maybe we should mark them as `not tested` until the bug is fixed?

Also we could catch the long `EOF` traceback, which has the deprecation warning hidden all the way at the top with something like:

```diff
-            self._change_prompt("polytope > ")
-            Expect._start(self, alt_message=None)
+            try:
+                self._change_prompt("polytope > ")
+                Expect._start(self, alt_message=None)
+            except RuntimeError:
+                raise RuntimeError("runtime error with deprecated pexpect-base interface to polymake; please install jupymake")
```

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
`polymake` has specific options for precomputed data, so that it takes the input unconditionally.

If we do not use it, our pickling/unpickling is even worse than recreating the polytope:

Before my commits:

Thank you for fixing that. I have made a few changes to the parser file so that it tests the new format. I also added it to the doc and did some very slight cleanup of that file too.

I am happy with everything. If my changes are good, then we can set this to a positive review. All tests pass for me.

Thanks, LGTM.

For the record, I tested the `spkg-configure.m4` using `tox -e docker-ubuntu-xenial-maximal -- config.status` (correctly does not accept lrslib) and `tox -e docker-ubuntu-bionic-maximal -- config.status` (correctly accepts lrslib).
