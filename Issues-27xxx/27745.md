<a id='comment:44'></a>The `lrslib` issue with `openmpi` is fixed (self-tests pass).

If i do `export MAKE='make -j4'` before running `sage -i -f polymake`, the compilation still eats all my CPU, though `spkg-install.in` relies on `sdh_make`.

Also, i have 6G free on my machine, and the compilation ends up with a `No space left on device`. How much disk space is required to build and install `polymake` ?

Thanks. Well that requires root access, but I guess we have a nice IT so they'll do it.

That sage itself can be just installed without root access is a wonderful thing... (But they also have installed the generated list of recommended packages for me, which makes things a lot faster.)

Is this an issue with the interface? Is this something with polymake trying to do something for the first time? Something else?

The branch just has one commit that cleans up the interface file a bit.

Here's how to debug this:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.polymake import PolymakeExpect
sage: polymake = PolymakeExpect(logfile="POLYMAKE.log")
sage: polymake.rand_sphere(4, 20, seed=5)
```

Then, in a separate terminal, use `tail -f POLYMAKE.log`

in `sage.interfaces.polymake` we have both `polymake_expect` and `polymake_jupymake` so which one is used in `polytopes.cube(backend='polymake')`?

How to tell `sage` I always want `polymake_jupymake` for every `something(backend='polymake')`?

<a id='comment:86'></a>I believe the issue with `_test_lawrence()` is numerical instability. Consider

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(-1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)], backend='polymake')
sage: from sage.misc.prandom import randint

sage: Q = p.lawrence_extension(2*v - p.center())
sage: R = p.lawrence_extension(2.0*v - p.center())
```
Using floating point numbers seems to lead to issues with the conversion back and forth as

```

```
This agrees with the backend information created from polymake, but how the faces are computed in Sage are different:

```

which is based off `R.combinatorial_polyhedron()`. In particular, if we try

```
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
...
ValueError: not all facets are joins of vertices
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
```

Based off this, what I would do is explicitly skip the test and state that it is a known issue with numerical instability. I am not sure what else we can do about fixing it at this point `:/`.

Do I understand correctly that Travis' remarks explain the error?

No, the failure in `_test_lawrence` shows up both for the `PolymakeExpect` and for the `PolymakeJupymake` interface.

`PolymakeExpect` has additional failures, which I do not know how to fix.

Also we could catch the long `EOF` traceback, which has the deprecation warning hidden all the way at the top with something like:

According to `dpkg -s libterm-readline-gnu-perl` I have version 1.36-1 installed. But anyway, it is not a huge issue to me, as installiing `jupymake` solved this all.

<a id='comment:4'></a>`polymake` has specific options for precomputed data, so that it takes the input unconditionally.

If we do not use it, our pickling/unpickling is even worse than recreating the polytope:
