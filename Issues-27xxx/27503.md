A few comments/questions:

- Are we sure that the result of the division has sufficient/correct precision? In other words, do we have to increase the precision of `sin` and/or `cos` to ensure that the `prec-1` term is computed correctly?
- It would be better to make this change:

  ```diff
  -        val = self.valuation()
  -        assert(val >= 1)
  +        assert(self.valuation() >= 1)
  ```
  That way the valuation is not computed if the assert statement is not run (as it is not needed other than a sanity check).
- Could we change the error message to fit the formatting want for Sage (i.e., following Python with starting with a lower case and no full stop/period)? I know it is inconsistent, but I think it is better when adding code not to exacerbate the problem. (If you think uniformity is better, then feel free to ignore.)
- You do not need `R = self.parent()`.

Concerning precision, I do not understand your concern. There is no reason to use more precision. Products and inverses of formal power series are well defined when truncated to a given precision.

I agree that it is well-defined. What I am worried about is that the division could introduce some slight difference from the correct value (when done with higher precision).
