1. It's not completely correct to say that `gfortran` must be installed since Sage will install it if needed. It would be good to clarify that.

2. What's up with the changes to `src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py`? There should be a separate ticket for that.

this is what we routinely do on OSX, so it does not look like a problem to me.

Thanks for your feedback on my proposed phrasing in commit a35d77e:

> A **Fortran compiler** (matching the C/C++ compiler) is recommended,
> although not a strict requirement: if none is present, **gfortran**
> will be built, and this might also trigger building **gcc**, since
> it is necessary to have matching versions of these two compilers.

How about the following?

> A **Fortran compiler** is recommended, although not a strict requirement:
> if none is present, **gfortran** will be built, and this might also trigger
> building **gcc**, depending on the OS and on what C/C++ compiler and what
> version of it is present. Having a Fortran compiler compatible with the
> C/C++ compiler (for example matching versions of **gcc** and **gfortran**,
> or compatible versions of **Clang** and **Flang**, or of **Clang** and
> **gfortran**) can thus save time and power when building Sage.
