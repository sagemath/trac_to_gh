1. It's not completely correct to say that `gfortran` must be installed since Sage will install it if needed. It would be good to clarify that.

2. What's up with the changes to `src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py`? There should be a separate ticket for that.

Thanks for your feedback on my proposed phrasing in commit a35d77e:

How about the following?

> A **Fortran compiler** is recommended, although not a strict requirement:
> if none is present, **gfortran** will be built, and this might also trigger
> building **gcc**, depending on the OS and on what C/C++ compiler and what
