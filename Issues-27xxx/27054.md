1. It's not completely correct to say that `gfortran` must be installed since Sage will install it if needed. It would be good to clarify that.

2. What's up with the changes to `src/sage/combinat/tutorial.py`? There should be a separate ticket for that.

On OS X, for what it's worth, I have installed gfortran (6.4.0) and I routinely build Sage with the built-in version of clang plus this gfortran. So maybe in an ideal world, the version of gfortran should match the C compiler, but it doesn't seem to be strictly necessary. Or have I just been getting lucky?

this is what we routinely do on OSX, so it does not look like a problem to me.

Thanks for your feedback on my proposed phrasing in commit a35d77e:

> A **Fortran compiler** (matching the C/C++ compiler) is recommended,

How about the following?

> A **Fortran compiler** is recommended, although not a strict requirement:
> if none is present, **gfortran** will be built, and this might also trigger
> building **gcc**, depending on the OS and on what C/C++ compiler and what
