I'm afraid I am in need of a faster way to create an integer partition.  It seems to me that there are two things to improve:

* the (relatively expensive) check whether the argument to `_Partitions` is actually a partition is done twice: once in `Partition.__init__` and, before that, in `Partitions._element_constructor_`.

* it appears that `x in NN` is expensive.

I do not yet know how to proceed.  I think it would be best to have a `check` keyword argument to allow bypassing checks, but also to speed up the checks themselves.

I did not change the behaviour concerning conversion to `ZZ`, but I followed your suggestion to skip the check in `__init__`.  Here is a comparison:

```
sage: l = [list(Partitions(10).random_element()) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 95.9 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(10).random_element())+[0]*50 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 56.6 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(50).random_element()) for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
100 loops, best of 3: 17.4 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(50).random_element())+[0]*50 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 67.1 ms per loop
```

```
sage: l = [list(Partitions(10).random_element()) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 75.1 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(10).random_element())+[0]*50 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
100 loops, best of 3: 18.2 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(50).random_element()) for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
100 loops, best of 3: 9.76 ms per loop
sage: l = [list(Partitions(50).random_element())+[0]*50 for _ in range(1000)]
sage: %timeit map(Partition, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 20.7 ms per loop
```

Question: to bypass the `_element_constructor_ `, is

```
def _make_partition(l):
    return _Partitions.element_class(_Partitions, l)
```
correct?

There is a failing test, which is failing because `KBoundedQuotientBases.ParentMethods.__getitem__` contains

```
c = self._kbounded_partitions.element_class(self._kbounded_partitions, list(c))
```
without checking that `c` is actually a partition.

I think that this is a bug, do you agree?

What I did was to raise an `Exception` in `Partition.__init__` whenever `mu` would not be a weakly decreasing list of nonnegative integers.  It was only triggered by the code in `k_dual.py`.  Since this code should not be performance critical (for performance, one would use `monomial`, not `__getitem__`), I think it is correct to create the element with checking.

Your timings in [comment:8](#comment%3A8) do not (necessarily) represent a fair comparison because you have generated random elements (length matters a lot here). You have to use the same elements.

The answer is yes to the question in [comment:8](#comment%3A8).

comment:9 is not a bug because the current code does check it. There is (currently) no hard semantic rule for where the checks should be done.

I agree with [comment:14](#comment%3A14) except I would not wrap `c` in a `list` for the second case (e.g., why redo the computation if `c` is an element of `self._kbounded_partitions`).

For this change:

```diff
-            return len(x) == 0 or (x[-1] in NN and
-                                   all(x[i] in NN and x[i] >= x[i+1] for i in range(len(x)-1)))
+            z = Integer(0)
+            try:
+                return (all(e == Integer(e) >= z for e in x) and
+                        all(e >= x[i+1] for i, e in enumerate(x[:-1])))
+            except TypeError:
+                return False
```
I disagree with using `try`-`except` for the length `0` test. IMO, it is confusing as it does not make it clear what it is testing for and it can hide bugs by catching more than it should. Also `e == Integer(e)`, a priori, is redundant with the coercion framework (although it is now more general because it allows conversions). You are also iterating over the list twice, which I believe is generally slower because of possible short-circuiting.
Performance critical code should really use `self.element_class` to avoid as much indirection as possible.

I think in general we should assume that there is no `0` in the partition, so `mu.index(0)` will be a much slower check than `mu[-1] == 0`. In particular, the former has the run over the entire list and deal with the exception.

It still should be done (also for memory usage).

> However, the following is a fair bit faster - it's the fastest of several combinations I tried - it's a bit unfortunate that it is cheaper to test `if x` than `if not x`.  I'm not sure whether it's better to test the last element for non-negativity first, or weakly decreasing first.  Is this correct and OK for you?


It is faster to test `a in ZZ` than `Integer(a)` when the input is an `Integer`:

```
sage: %timeit 5 in ZZ
10000000 loops, best of 3: 87.4 ns per loop
sage: %timeit Integer(5)
10000000 loops, best of 3: 121 ns per loop
```
but that is not the case for non-`Integer` objects:

```
sage: %timeit 5.0 in ZZ
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.41 µs per loop
sage: %timeit Integer(5.0)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.36 µs per loop
sage: %timeit 5/1 in ZZ
1000000 loops, best of 3: 705 ns per loop
sage: %timeit Integer(5/1)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 479 ns per loop
```
Moreover, false results are much faster than handling the `TypeError`:

```
sage: def test1(x):
....:     return x in ZZ
....: def test2(x):
....:     try:
....:         return Integer(x)
....:     except TypeError:
....:         return False
....:     
sage: %timeit test1(1/2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.22 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test2(1/2)
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.56 µs per loop
```
In addition, the same statements about the `try`-`except` block still hold here. So I would not want to use that code. Also, be wary of a tautology: you create a partition, check to see if it is in the parent, which then is true because it is a partition.

It should return `False`.

Hi Travis!

I just tried

```
            return not x or (all(a in ZZ and a >= b for a, b in zip(x, x[1:]))
                             and x[-1] in ZZ and x[-1] >= 0)
```
but that is significantly slower (by a factor of 1.6, that is) when `x` is a weakly decreasing list of `int`s.

On the other hand, if `x` is a weakly decreasing list of `Integer`s, it is not (significantly) faster (only by a factor of 0.96).

I will check my timings later today, but maybe it's obvious to you why the new version is not better.  I do think that weakly decreasing lists of integer-like objects (mostly `int` and `Integer`) is the most important input, do you agree?

Aside: in case it is better and I made a mistake, `NonNegativeIntegers.__contains__` is not ideal:

```
    def __contains__(self, elt):
        try:
            i = Integer(elt)
            return  i >= Integer(0) and i == elt
        except TypeError:
            return False

```

sage: l = [map(Integer, Partitions(50).random_element()+[0]*50) for _ in range(10000)]
sage: %timeit map(test1, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 89.8 ms per loop
sage: %timeit map(test2, l)
10 loops, best of 3: 71.5 ms per loop
```

Conclusion:

For weakly decreasing lists of integers, `test2` is slightly faster if the input is a list of `Integer`s.  However, `test1` is much faster if the input is a list of `int`s.

I think I incorporated all your suggestions.

I noticed one alternative:

    Maybe trailing zeros should be removed in `Partitions._element_constructor_` rather than in `Partition.__init__`?

Advantages of the former:

* all data manipulation happens in one place
* we avoid copying the partition another time

Advantages of the latter:

* safer code

The way I have now implemented the removal of trailing zeros seems to be quite efficient if there are hardly any, which I would expect to be the most common case.

Thanks. This should be the last little bits.

Did you check this on Python3? The `map` no longer returns a list for that, so I think there will be a problem with `mu[-1]`. You might need to wrap that with a `list` as well.

I think a better error message for the `map(ZZ, lst)` would be something like

```
all parts must be nonnegative integers
```
to be a bit more specific about what is failing (since it is separated out).

Did you try also timing it doing the check

```python
pos = len(mu) - 1
while pos >= 0 and not mu[pos]:
    pos += 1
CombinatorialElement.__init__(self, parent, mu[:pos])
```
I am just wondering about all of those little temporary lists being created.

For the `__getitem__`, I think we should allow "fake" integers (e.g., `2/1 in QQ`) by checking `if c in ZZ`. Although I don't think we were entirely sure this was doing the correct things before:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: s[2/1]
s[2]
sage: _.leading_support()[0]
2
sage: _.parent()
Rational Field
sage: list(2/1)
[2]
```
I believe your current approach will fix this, but we should add a test.

fixed! Thank you! (slightly embarassed :-)

Hm, what we are actually testing at

```
        try:
            lst = list(map(ZZ, lst))
        except TypeError:
            raise ValueError('%s is not an element of %s'%(repr(lst), self))
```
is of course that we have an iterable of integers.  Nonnegativity is only checked in the individual `__contains__`.

Is there any good reason that `list(map(ZZ, l))` is three times faster than `list(map(NN, l))`?  If not so, is there any good reason to have the entries of partitions in `ZZ` rather than `NN`?

If it makes you feel better, you can say "must be integers", but that is misleading to the user who sees the error. IMO, it is fine for a weaker test to assert a stronger statement.

If that is true (why?) then take a copy before change anything

```
if mu and not mu[-1]:
    mu = mu[:-1]
    while mu and not mu[-1]:
        mu.pop()

I now checked

```
def test_contains1(x):
    return not x or (all((a in ZZ) and (a >= b) for a, b in zip(x, x[1:]))
                     and (x[-1] in ZZ) and (x[-1] >= 0))

    return not x or (all((x[i] in ZZ) and (x[i] >= x[i+1]) for i in range(len(x)-1))
                     and (x[-1] in ZZ) and (x[-1] >= 0))
```
and the second version is slightly slower (roughly by a factor 1.17), even for very long lists `x` (having more than 1000 elements).  I suspect that copying is faster than adding.

It's not our job to protect against every possible bad input. Garbage in, garbage out.

OK, I agree.  But then I think I should do

```
        C = self.basis().keys()
        if not isinstance(c, C.element_class):
            try:
                c = Integer(c)
            except TypeError:
                c = C(c)
            else:
                c = C([c])
        return self.monomial(c)
```
in all the `__getitem__` methods.  (Because otherwise `s[2/1]` succeeds by sheer luck (because elements of `QQ` are iterable), but `s[QQbar(2)]` or `s[2.0]` don't.  Do you agree?

Off topic: doesn't it take longer to copy a long list than a short list?

Actually, copying seems to be roughly linear:

```
sage: for i in range(1,6):
....:     l = [randint(1,100) for _ in range(10^i)]
....:     %timeit l[1:]
....:     
The slowest run took 12.66 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 791 ns per loop
The slowest run took 9.37 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.37 µs per loop
100000 loops, best of 3: 7.21 µs per loop
10000 loops, best of 3: 70.1 µs per loop
1000 loops, best of 3: 838 µs per loop
