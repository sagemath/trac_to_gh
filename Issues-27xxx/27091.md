[sage-support report](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/TvYNbQu4TZU/UkWoCdKEDQAJ) observes that construction of libsingular polynomials from a dictionary (which is what pickle does) can be very slow, and can be beaten by constructing smaller polynomials and summing those together. Illustration of the problem:

```
def balanced_sum(L):
    if len(L)==0:
        raise ValueError("balanced sum takes a non-empty list")
    i=0
    while len(L)>1:
        L[i]+=L.pop()
        i+=1
        if i>=len(L)-1: i=0
    return L[i]

R.<x0,x1,x2,x3>=QQ[]
f=(x0+x1+x2+x3)^40 #has 12341 terms
D=f.dict()
L=[{k:v} for k,v in D.items()]
%timeit R(D) # 378 ms for me
%timeit balanced_sum([R(t) for t in L]) #139 ms for me
```

Is this just a matter of balanced summing or can we make this even more efficient? We should just be writing the polynomial in-place. We know the length of the dict, so we know for how many terms we need to reserve memory.

I also noted that in `MPolynomialRing_libsingular._element_constructor_` we are dealing with the case `MPolynomial_polydict` twice: on line 819 and then again on line 920.
