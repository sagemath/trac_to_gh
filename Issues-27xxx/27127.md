This doctest was failing with py3. My understanding is that neighbors of a vertex are visited in different orders in py2 and py3 as the order in which elements of a set are listed might differ (see `G._backend.iterator_nbrs??`). Here, if the first visited neighbor of `'00'` is `'01'` or `'10'`, we get different answers. With py3 we get `[This is the Trac macro *'00', '10', '11', '01', '00'* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#'00', '10', '11', '01', '00'-macro)` and so the doctest was  failing.

Using `CycleGraph(4)`, the doctest is more stable and we get the same answer with py2 and py3. `CubeGraph(2)` is a cycle of order 4, so it's essentially the same test.
