This ticket fixes all the Python 3 issues causing doctest failures related to the optional Mathematica interface.

- A regular expression is fixed that resulted in several of these messages:
  {{{
  FutureWarning: Possible nested set at position 3
  }}}

- The `__len__()` method now returns `int` as expected by `len()` in Python 3. Previously it returned Mathematica elements resulting in:
  {{{
  TypeError: 'MathematicaElement' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
  }}}
