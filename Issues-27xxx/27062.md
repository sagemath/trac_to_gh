By the way, ipython has a similar facility, a magic `%load`:

```
In [4]: %load p.py

In [5]: # %load p.py
   ...: if __name__ == '__main__':
   ...:     print("blah")
   ...: 
blah

In [6]: 
```

So you propose to deviate from this, too....

I don't think Sage's `load()` function necessarily has to be exactly analogous to IPython's `%load` magic, but I am beginning to come around to your point.

I believe what's really missing here is a way to `import` .sage files as though they were normal Python modules.

I think this would be really easy to do too, so maybe I'll just do that (and accept this documentation note in the meantime).

I don't seem to get anything on gitlab that points to your request - could you tell me where to look?

there is nothing on 
https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/merge_requests/5
to do for me, in fact.

But  I just noticed in a merge request in my fork, duh...
All done now.

Well, I don't think it is bad - it's just different - you need to know where to look, and this is actually quite intuitive.
And it is better, as there is no need to mess with branches manually.
(unless you work in public/, with all the possible gotcha's).
