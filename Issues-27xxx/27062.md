By the way, ipython has a similar facility, a magic `%load`:

```
In [4]: %load p.py

In [5]: # %load p.py
   ...: if __name__ == '__main__':
   ...:     print("blah")
   ...: 
blah

In [6]: 
```

So you propose to deviate from this, too....

I don't think Sage's `load()` function necessarily has to be exactly analogous to IPython's `%load` magic, but I am beginning to come around to your point.

I believe what's really missing here is a way to `import` .sage files as though they were normal Python modules.

I think this would be really easy to do too, so maybe I'll just do that (and accept this documentation note in the meantime).

I don't seem to get anything on gitlab that points to your request - could you tell me where to look?

there is nothing on 
https://gitlab.com/sagemath/sage/merge_requests/5
to do for me, in fact.

But  I just noticed in a merge request in my fork, duh...
All done now.

Well, I don't think it is bad - it's just different - you need to know where to look, and this is actually quite intuitive.
And it is better, as there is no need to mess with branches manually.
(unless you work in public/, with all the possible gotcha's).

No, it's not in one place - it's on your computer, on the ticket's author's computer, in different git branches, on trac, on trac's git server, whereas on gitlab it's all there. 
Things can, and do, go wrong in many different ways.

Whereas on gitlab the review and tests (something not quite ready yet) are all done online. It's only cause I'm a very unexperienced user of gitlab, I did ask that question is the 1st place (and I didn't even check my repo for notification - I could have set up an email notifications and got it in mailbox then, totally clear).
