I believe what's really missing here is a way to `import` .sage files as though they were normal Python modules.

I think this would be really easy to do too, so maybe I'll just do that (and accept this documentation note in the meantime).

Well, I don't think it is bad - it's just different - you need to know where to look, and this is actually quite intuitive.
And it is better, as there is no need to mess with branches manually.
(unless you work in public/, with all the possible gotcha's).
