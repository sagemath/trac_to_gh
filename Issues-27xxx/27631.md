this is a followup to #26899, where a stop-gap was implemented to let Sage build on a `/usr/include`-less OSX.

It turns out it is pretty easy to provide such a fix.

One also has to do something to pillow:

```
The headers or library files could not be found for zlib,
a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

I tested this on an OSX 10.14 with command-line tools-only installation of Xcode.
It would be great to have this tested on OSX with full-blown Xcode.

I guess one last thing to add would be to bump the patch level in the pillow package-version.txt.

Although rebuilding python might force a rebuild of pillow, it would still be good to be explicit.  Then you can set to positive review as far as I'm concerned.

I haven't noticed any action on this upstream, but I (or Dima) should make a PR for his patch.  I think it's quite good and has a chance of being accepted; or at the very least making a PR might help spur action upstream.

In the meantime I don't think we should wait.  This is a problem for us *now*, and I have no problem with patching build system stuff.

There is a new fun OSX bug, breaking testsuite on 10.14.4: https://bugs.python.org/issue36432

(I also got it after trying to make a PR for upstream: https://github.com/dimpase/cpython/commit/41617bd6cd957995ec9e1f89558fbdce5f78bc79)
