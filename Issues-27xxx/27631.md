I haven't noticed any action on this upstream, but I (or Dima) should make a PR for his patch.  I think it's quite good and has a chance of being accepted; or at the very least making a PR might help spur action upstream.

In the meantime I don't think we should wait.  This is a problem for us *now*, and I have no problem with patching build system stuff.

There is a new fun OSX bug, breaking testsuite on 10.14.4: https://bugs.python.org/issue36432

(I also got it after trying to make a PR for upstream: https://github.com/dimpase/cpython/commit/41617bd6cd957995ec9e1f89558fbdce5f78bc79)
