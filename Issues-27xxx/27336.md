I have seen this at least since the 6.5 sequence (b0 and rc0).  Not sure it was intermittent at that point.
It popped up again in the 8.4-8.7 sequences.
FWIW, the problem recurs, intermittently) if I test polynomial.pyx by itself, but in a loop (for i in a b c d...).

My current system is a fairly shiny new iMac Pro (18-core Xeon W, 128GB Ram, and 4TB SSD), so I think it's fairly speedy.  I typically build with "-j20", but I have seen this with "-j6".
