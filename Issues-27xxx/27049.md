Apparently only on some platforms then, because I ran this exact branch without problems. It means some divisions need to be encoded differently. 

Is it indeed the case that dividing an element of RealField by a python integer may yield a float on some and a RealField element on others if "division" is imported? That would be really bad and would make porting a lot harder.

No, if this really is a problem we can replace the "division by two" by an exponent operation, which would be very fast. I just need to know which operations are the problematic ones. On the computers I have access to, there is no problem, so I can't debug the problem presently.
