Apparently only on some platforms then, because I ran this exact branch without problems. It means some divisions need to be encoded differently. 

Is it indeed the case that dividing an element of RealField by a python integer may yield a float on some and a RealField element on others if "division" is imported? That would be really bad and would make porting a lot harder.

No, if this really is a problem we can replace the "division by two" by an exponent operation, which would be very fast. I just need to know which operations are the problematic ones. On the computers I have access to, there is no problem, so I can't debug the problem presently.

By running "sage -b" I was able to replicate the erroneous behaviour :-). Turns out the problem arose from an erroneous "fractional" exponent that was never fractional, so this code was actually not behaving as intended before, but doing so silently.

Hopefully the problem is solved now.
