The file `src/sage/interacts/library.py` has this snippet:

```
# Get a bunch of functions from the user globals. In SageNB, this will
# refer to SageNB functions; in Jupyter, this will refer to Jupyter
# functions. In the command-line and for doctests, we import the
# SageNB functions as fall-back.
for name in ("interact", "checkbox", "input_box", "input_grid",
        "range_slider", "selector", "slider", "text_control"):
    try:
        obj = get_global(name)
    except NameError:
        import sagenb.notebook.interact
        obj = sagenb.notebook.interact.__dict__[name]
    globals()[name] = obj
```

In other words, the doctest framework is testing the SageNB implementation of widgets. This should instead default to using the Jupyter implementation.

In this case, I removed the offending doctests. Part of it was copied verbatim from a different doctest and the rest wasn't really adding any value as test. Note that this code is sagenb-specific, so it cannot be run on Jupyter anyway.
