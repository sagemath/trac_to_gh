There are (undocumented?) symbolic wrappers around `RIF`, `RBF` objects, but solving equations with them

```
sage: var('x')
sage: solve(x + RIF(0.999,1.001) == 0, x)
```

fails because the inexact objects cannot be converted to Maxima objects.

This is confusing to new users; see [Ask SageMath: long traceback when calling solve()](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45473/long-traceback-when-calling-solve/).

Specifying `algorithm='sympy'` gives a solution but loses information about precision.

The least thing that could be done is for `solve(eqn, x)` to check `eqn.is_exact()` and give a warning.

Keywords: **RIF, RBF, solve**

<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

One notes that numerical root seeking via `find_root` also fails for both RIF and RBF :

```
sage: u=RIF(0.99,1.01);u
1.0?
sage: s=find_root(x+u,-3,3);s
-1.0
sage: type(s)
<type 'float'>
sage: v=RBF(v);v
1.000000000000000
sage: v=v.add_error(0.01);v
[1.0 +/- 0.0101]
sage: s2=find_root(x+v,-3,3);s2
-1.0
sage: type(s2)
<type 'float'>
```

Extending `find_root` to handle RIF and RBF expressions would allow to handle the cases where no explicit form of a root solution is known (e. g. implicit expressions resulting of `solve`), where `find_root` allows to compute a numerical approxomation.

This would certainly be handy (but is probably a significant project in itself !).

It might also be useful to check which of the optimization functions in Sage support such uncertainty handling...
