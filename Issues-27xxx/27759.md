- pyflakes warnings cleaned up. (Interestingly, the corresponding code/lines do not seem to be changed by the series of tickets ending with #26682, but the diff of the pyflakes output indicates they are not; not sure why this is so; maybe does not matter.)

- There is

  ```
  src/sage/rings/asymptotic/growth_group.py:2260: undefined name 'CartesianProductGrowthGroups'
  ```
  does not seem to be cleanup-able as this comes from a lazy import (so it actually is imported as should).

So, let's see what the patchbot says now ;)
