```
For example (in sage 8.6.b1),

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ,'x')
sage: M = libgap(matrix(2,2,[x,1,2,3]))
sage: M
[ [ x, 1 ], [ 2, 3 ] ]
sage: M.IsMatrix()
false
```
so that all matrix methods are broken on the result

In 8.5.rc0, this also fails, so it is not a regression IMO. I would maybe say it is a bug, but either way, this does fix it by making sure everything is actually in the same GAP ring. Here was the old behavior:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ,'x')
sage: M = libgap(matrix(2,2,[x,x^2,x^3,x^4]))
sage: M.IsMatrix()
true
sage: M[0,1].Ring()
Integers
sage: M[0,0].Ring()
<ring with 1 generators>
```
I am not exactly sure how GAP recognizes a matrix (old behavior):

```
sage: M = libgap(matrix(2,2,[3/2,1,2,3]))
sage: M.IsMatrix()
true
sage: [elt.Ring() for row in M for elt in row]
[<ring with 1 generators>,
 Integers,
 <ring with 1 generators>,
 <ring with 1 generators>]
```
Anyways, this fixes the problem, so I am setting this to a positive review.
