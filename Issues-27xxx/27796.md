The implication here is that dollar signs are bad; is that what you intend? Dollar signs are [explicitly allowed](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#latex-typesetting) according to our documentation, and people who are used to LaTeX will be comfortable using them. I see no reason to discourage their use.

My understanding is the dollar signs were (strongly) discouraged and the documentation used to reflect this. Although apparently that is not the case and/or has changed. We also (much) more uniformly have backticks throughout the codebase, so there is that too.
