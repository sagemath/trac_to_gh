From looking at the code here are some things that should be fixed:

- Missing Authors in the Authors field (required to get bots to run on the tickets)
- Coverage is not 100%: every methods needs to have an EXAMPLE and likely a TESTS block (for example testing that raising errors work appropriately.
- Some pyflakes errors occur: some imports are not needed
- Perhaps be more precise than `'this can't happen'` in the `RuntimeErrors` messages.

Further, many methods docstring do not have the usual OUTPUT block so as to know which type of object is returned. Please have a look at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html for a detail of the conventions.
