Do you mean the  spkg-configure of polymake?

This might be a bit tricky, I'd just implement a version check, which errors
out with a message to install a newer gcc. You if needed might tweak spkg-configure of gcc to make it easier.

As well, very old gcc's (say, 4.4) cannot even compile Sage's gcc.

Also note that clang typically fakes a gcc, sometimes (on OSX) quite old one.

on the other hand, yes, in `polymake/spkg-config.m4` you can do something like 

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([gcc], [
    sage_spkg_install_polymake=yes
    AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])
    if test $IS_REALLY_GCC = yes ; then
       AS_CASE(["$GXX_VERSION.0"],
           [[[0-4]].*|5.0.*], [
               SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([you have $CXX version $GXX_VERSION, which is too old to build polymake])
                ])
    fi
```

but I am not sure whether this would kick in regardless of the experimental status of polymake.

In fact I would be in favours of dropping gcc 4 support completely, and require at least 5.1 globally.

Hardly an improvement.

Where's the ticket that will change "sage -i PACKAGE" to just reconfiguration with "--enable-PACKAGE" appended to the configure command line and "make build"?
