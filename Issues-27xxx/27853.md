<a id='comment:2'></a>Do you mean the  spkg-configure of polymake?

This might be a bit tricky, I'd just implement a version check, which errors
out with a message to install a newer gcc. You if needed might tweak spkg-configure of gcc to make it easier.

As well, very old gcc's (say, 4.4) cannot even compile Sage's gcc.

Also note that clang typically fakes a gcc, sometimes (on OSX) quite old one.

```
SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE([gcc], [

```

but I am not sure whether this would kick in regardless of the experimental status of polymake.

In fact I would be in favours of dropping gcc 4 support completely, and require at least 5.1 globally.

Hardly an improvement.

Where's the ticket that will change "sage -i PACKAGE" to just reconfiguration with "--enable-PACKAGE" appended to the configure command line and "make build"?
