Currently Sage uses 2-Sweep algorithm for finding a Lower bound for diameter, We can find a more tighter lower bound for diameter using 4-Sweep algorithm, as suggested in this paper: https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Laurent.Viennot/road/papers/ifub.pdf 

This algorithm also improves average complexity for finding diameter for a graph by providing a better source for iFUB algorithm, as shown in the paper.
