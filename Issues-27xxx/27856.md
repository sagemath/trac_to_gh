In Sage 8.7, we have

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: p = M((2,-1), name='p')
sage: TpM = M.tangent_space(p)
sage: v = TpM((-2, 3), name='v'); v
Tangent vector v at Point p on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: f = M.scalar_field(x*y^2, name='f')
sage: v(f)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: the argument no. 1 must be a linear form
```
Note that this works for vector *fields*:

```
sage: w = M.vector_field(name='w')
sage: w[:] = -y, x
sage: w.display()
w = -y d/dx + x d/dy
sage: w(f)
Scalar field w(f) on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: w(f).display()
w(f): M --> R
   (x, y) |--> 2*x^2*y - y^3
```
This issue has been reported in this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46593/tangent-space-vector-mapping/).

No problem. Actually I should have used "behave" instead of "act" to avoid any confusion (there is indeed no group action here). 

>I guess this is fine since it is done on an element and not a parent.

For my own instruction, can you tell by which magic this is done (given that `__call__` is not redefined in the base class `Element`)?
