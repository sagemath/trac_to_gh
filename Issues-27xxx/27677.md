I noticed that the Docker build-from-clean jobs still build packages like zlib even though it can be avoided since the work done so far on#27330 so long as the correct system headers installed in the build container.

On one hand, while I think it's good to test full builds of Sage-the-distribution with all SPKGs enabled, I think that's more a job for the Buildbot fleet, whereas for Docker images we want to avoid as much overhead as possible.

For now the savings are small (just a few small libraries like zlib and libffi).  But as we continue to make progress (e.g. with #27212) the savings will become more significant.

Thoughts?

In any case, I agree that building everything from scratch is what the buildbots are good for. So removing things from build-from-clean appears to be a good idea.

Agreed.

> For now the savings are small (just a few small libraries like zlib and libffi).  But as we continue to make progress (e.g. with #27212) the savings will become more significant.

Yes, small(er) docker images are preferable, in particular, if this is kind of easily possible by using system libraries.

Not *that* rarely though, and it will still save significant time in the long term.

I don't think it will make images *much* smaller, but certainly a little bit.
