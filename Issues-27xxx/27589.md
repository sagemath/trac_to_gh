On OSX 10.14 I see a weird behaviour of uninstall.py: sometimes it leaves symbolic links to libraries unremoved, and then the re-install of a package fails, as these links cannot be overwritten.

I gather this might be due to `os.path.exists()` returning False on existing, but broken, symbolic links (and they can become broken if files they point to are removed first).

I am experimenting with  `os.path.exists() or os.path.lexists()` test for existence in `build/sage_bootstrap/uninstall.py` - this should return True on broken links too.
