I would move the doc from `FunctionFieldDifferential_global.__init__` to the class level (`FunctionFieldDifferential_global`) and instead put a test in the `__init__` to do a `TestSuite(foo).run()`.

I think you are better off cached `_differential_space()` than `differential_space()` as all of the other parts of the construction are essentially trivial and that way `basis_differential_space()` also will benefit from the caching.

I am not sure that the `_element_constructor_` raising an `NotImplementedError` is the best behavior. It suggests that any other input should be handled. The typical thing done here is to instead raise a `ValueError`.

Does the differential space have the structure of a Lie algebra, where `[X, Y] = XY - YX` is also in the space?

Do you want to add a `_latex_` for the differentials? Same question for ascii/unicode art.

I missed that. Thanks. Done.

No. The space of derivations is closed under commutator operation though, but I don't know even the definition of product of differentials...

Yes for `_latex_`. Done.

Ah, right. They are not the same. Another naïve question, do the differentials `d(x)` satisfy some commutation relation like in the Weyl algebra:

```
[dx, x] = 1   <=>   dx x = x dx + 1
```

```
sage: W.<x> = algebras.DifferentialWeyl(QQ)
sage: dx = W.differentials()['dx']
sage: x * dx
x*dx
sage: dx*x - x*dx
1
```

One other question: Can you say anything more about the space of differentials? Is it 1 dimensional (over its base ring)? If so, I can make the necessary implementations to get it into the correct category.

Finally, one more nitpick on output:

```
sage: S(1)
(0) d(x)
```
looks strange. It would also be nice to have the special output cases as doctests to show the indent.

The space of differentials is 1 dimensional over the function field F. Therefore  differentials are of the form fdx with an element f and a separable element x in F.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A8):
> I want to clarify one thing, the Weyl algebra could possibly be a separate implementation that could be a bigger space (and a separate ticket). There is a question of would it be the more natural object or would we want to have 2 objects with a natural coercion when performing multiplication (I implemented this for Lie algebras going to their universal enveloping algebras, so I could port that over).


This is a territory, mostly unknown to me. I don't know if the space of differentials on a function field belongs to the category of Weyl algebras. I guess not.  But if somehow can be related, it would be good to have natural coercion between it and the bigger Weyl algebra, of course.

Well, I guess the definition does not straight lift since a Weyl algebra is defined over a polynomial ring. Maybe we could define it under this class of generalized Weyl algebras due to Bavula (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08941)? Anyways, just something to ponder and I was curious about (seeing if we could form a natural ring in an analogous way).

Here are the promised changes making it into a finite-dimensional module with basis. If my changes are good, then positive review.
