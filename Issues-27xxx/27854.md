This ticket fixes the remaining doctest failures in `cluster_algebra_seed`; these were all due to the usual issue with sorting.

There is still a failure, namely

```
File "src/sage/combinat/cluster_algebra_quiver/quiver.py", line 1079, in sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.quiver.ClusterQuiver.frozen_vertices
Failed example:
    Q.frozen_vertices()
Expected:
    ['b', 'd']
Got:
    ['d', 'b']
```
that seems to happen only 50% of the times. Does anyone here know what could this depend on?
