Please refrain to introduce anymore call to `is_package_installed`, especially when checking for a python package.

Well, let's do a follow up ticket since this is getting merged properly right now. Please refrain to introduce anymore call to `is_package_installed`, especially when checking for a python package. There is a proper python way to do this, like in the other sections of code using `igraph`- from `sage/graphs/digraph.py` line 693 onward

```
            try:
                import igraph
            except ImportError:
                raise ImportError(...)
```
replacing the `ImportError(...)` with `PackageNotFoundError` is acceptable.

`is_package_installed` is a big problem for sage-on-distro and it is a filthy quick and dirty hack that shouldn't ever have been included.

It is already on its way out. The only place it is not replaced by feature or something else at runtime is in `sage/databases/cremona.py` and there is a ticket for that. 

It is currently impossible to totally remove it. doctesting with `--option=all` relies on it (or other features of `packages.py` which is just as bad) :( and building with some optional package still depends on it look in `sage_setup/optional_extension.py `. In both case replacement are not easy.
