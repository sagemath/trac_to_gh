There is a proper python way to do this, like in the other sections of code using `igraph`- from `sage/graphs/digraph.py` line 693 onward

```
            try:
                import igraph
            except ImportError:
                raise ImportError(...)
```
replacing the `ImportError(...)` with `PackageNotFoundError` is acceptable.

`is_package_installed` is a big problem for sage-on-distro and it is a filthy quick and dirty hack that shouldn't ever have been included.
