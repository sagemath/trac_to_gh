# Issue 27721: Add wrappers around flint headers in Sage

There is a problem in a few of the packages they use (flint is not the only one, but it is one where this specific problem is most pervasive) in that they all use the name `ulong` in some way or other.  flint also has an `slong` but that does not seem to have as many conflicts.

I first reported this in #27714 but this ticket is to propose a specific fix.

I've noted this problem in at least:

* flint/flint.h:

  {{{
  #define ulong mp_limb_t
  #define slong mp_limb_signed_t
  }}}

* zn_poly/zn_poly.h:

  {{{
  /*
  I get really sick of typing unsigned long.
  */
  typedef unsigned long  ulong;
  }}}

* pari/parigen.h:

  {{{
  #ifdef _WIN64
  typedef unsigned long long pari_ulong;
  #define long long long
  #define labs llabs
  #else
  typedef unsigned long pari_ulong;
  #endif
  #define ulong pari_ulong
  }}}

And for completeness, it's worth noting these definitions from gmp.h:

```
#ifdef __GMP_SHORT_LIMB
typedef unsigned int        mp_limb_t;
typedef int         mp_limb_signed_t;
#else
#ifdef _LONG_LONG_LIMB
typedef unsigned long long int  mp_limb_t;
typedef long long int       mp_limb_signed_t;
#else
typedef unsigned long int   mp_limb_t;
typedef long int        mp_limb_signed_t;
#endif
#endif
typedef unsigned long int   mp_bitcnt_t;
```

The problem is most evident in modules that happen to combine any two of these headers.  For example in src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_zmod_flint.pyx both flint.h and zn_poly.h are used.  Because of the `#define ulong mp_limb_t` in flint.h, the typedef in zn_poly.h expands to: `typedef unsigned long mp_limb_t`.

Because this compiles to a C++ file this happens to be just fine most of the time because C++ allows benign re-typedefs and indeed it just happens that this is compatible with the original definition of `mp_limb_t` from gmp.h, at least most of the time.

However, as I found in #27714 that doesn't always have to be true.  The GMP system package on Cygwin has GMP configured in such a way that `_LONG_LONG_LIMB` is defined, so it defines `typedef long long int mp_limb_t`, and all this fragile overloading breaks down.

I think in some sense flint is the "worst" problem here since it ties its `ulong` and `slong` macros to typedefs in GMP which themselves can, we now know, be platform-dependent. So this introduces a lot of problems.

I'm experimenting with adding a wrapper around all includes of flint headers in Sage in order to work around this problem, but I'd be happy to have other suggestions.

The same idea (`#undef ulong`) could be used for FLINT, provided that they don't expose the name `ulong` in other macros. For example, this macros will break after `#undef ulong`:

```
#define PTR_TO_COEFF(x) (((ulong) (x) >> 2) | (WORD(1) << (FLINT_BITS - 2)))
```
but Sage doesn't use that.

Let me see if this quick fix works.

Here is my proposal for wrappers for the flint and arb headers to use when including them in Sage.  Rather than make many wrappers for each individual header, I just include all the flint headers in the flint wrapper, and similarly in the arb wrapper (with `flint/NTL-interface.h` being one special exception).

This of course results in "over-including" in some cases, but I don't think this is a serious problem.

I'm also aware that in newer versions of Cython it's possible to add arbitrary post-include code in a docstring under a `cdef extern` statement, but I felt that this would be more reliable and manageable than dozens of essentially duplicate "docstrings".

Between this, and the small PR to flint from #27714 this resolved all build issues for me.

I think I see what you're saying.  But how would this work in cases where we want to use flint and zn_poly together, or flint and pari together?  IIUC `ctypedef mp_limb_t ulong` will put an actual `typedef mp_limb_t ulong` into the C sources, which could conflict with the `ulong` from those other libraries' headers.

Or should we provide wrappers for them too?

Maybe I'm missing something though. I'm willing to try it.

So keep the comments but just the original header name, like

```
# flint/flint.h
```

or something like that?
