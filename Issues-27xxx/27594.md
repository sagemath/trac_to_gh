In #27094 we upgraded Sage's GAP dependency to 4.10.1. 4.10.1 added several new functions to the official libgap API, and we should try to use them as much as possible, where applicable, rather than trying to hack around the API.

For example, we should try to use `GAP_CallFuncArray` for calling GAP functions.

Trying to reimplement as much of Sage's GAP interface with the new API will in turn produce valuable feedback for the GAP developers.
