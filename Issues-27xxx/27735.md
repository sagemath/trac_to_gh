This should create a grid widget in the Jupyter notebook (it already works this way in the Sage notebook):

```
@interact
def f(A = matrix([[1,1],[-1,1]])):
    print(A)
    print(type(A))
```

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
Currently using the widget may generate `SyntaxError` when you modifiy an input field.
Let's say you have value `1` in one of your input fields and you want to input `-23` instead, you get one syntax error when delelting `1` on a second when you type `-`.

```
  File "<string>", line 1
    -
    ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

Maybe there is a way of filtering these cases or evaluating the input only after the focus leave the input field instead of evaluating after each modification/keystroke.

The python3 patchbot plugin says "from .widgets_sagenb import input_grid" is incompatible with python3 which isn't true.

Looks good to me.

On the Sage cell server, there is a "submit" button with matrices, which is why it isn't an issue.  In sagenb there is no submit button, but this focus issue does not arise; until one presses enter, one can modify an input entry to heart's content. So I would indeed call this a bug.  

The question is whether it is unique to this new matrix input functionality in Jupyter (in which case it should be fixed here), or whether all Jupyter input grids etc. suffer from this (in which case a new ticket is needed, and it's yet another place where sagenb still is better than Jupyter).  What happens with `input_grid` currently in Jupyter?

Since I haven't observed it, I don't know if it is limited to `input_grid` or not, and I don't have time to fire up a Jupyter right now and do testing.  @vinklein, since you originally observed this, can you test what does/doesn't work in Jupyter and open a new ticket?  Thank you!
