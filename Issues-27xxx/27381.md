As reported [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/DokUHxVQ6aA)

```
./sage -t --long --valgrind "doctest"
```
appears to be broken. For example

```
./sage -t --long --valgrind src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
```
retuns one to the shell prompt and in `~/.sage/valgrind/sage-memcheck.8525` there is

```
==8525== Memcheck, a memory error detector

==8525==
==8525== FATAL: can't open suppressions file "/64bitdev/storage/sage-git_develop/sage/local/lib/valgrind/sage.supp"
```
So the `suppressions` files cannot be located.

The `suppressions` files are now located under `$SAGE_EXTCODE/valgrind` instead of under `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/valgrind`. I have included all of the available `suppressions` files and one line in `control.py` was changed so the doctest would pass.

The suppression files have been moved there by Volker at sage-6.4.beta5. But `control.py` didn't follow. Incredibly some of it should have been picked up in [https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/59af6983b05b6581ef1282cdec41d6e63ad82459](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/59af6983b05b6581ef1282cdec41d6e63ad82459) in sage-6.8.beta4 if valgrind had been tested then.
