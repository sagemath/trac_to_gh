after trying comment 18 in #26686, I can build Sage with `make sagenb`, but `make -j1` still does not want to build the documentation:

I will try to rebuild Sage 8.6 from scratch, to see if the problem is reproducible.

By the way, while creating this ticket, you should have copied the description of the problem I had, since the description of this ticket is not very informative...
