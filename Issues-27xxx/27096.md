Should be fixed.

As far as I understand, I should add a doctest demonstrating that the problem is fixed. The point is that I'm not sure I can easily produce an exemple on which the previous buggy implementation fails. Is it really needed?

That's the point.

I don't a doctest showing that the bug is fixed and I think it won't be so easy to produce one. However, the algorithm which is implemented currently (that is before the fix) is not proved.
