In many cases it is preferable to work with monic chebyshev polynomials, but there is currently no easy way to do so. This ticket adds an option (set to false by default) in the chebyshev method to return a monic chebyshev polynomial. This should work in both Affine and Projective space.

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: P.chebyshev_polynomial(3, monic = True)
Dynamical System of Projective Space of dimension 1 over Rational Field
  Defn: Defined on coordinates by sending (x : y) to
        (x^3 - 3*x*y^2 : y^3)
```
