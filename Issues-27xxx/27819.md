I added a sanity check for duplicate elements if `linear_extension` is set to `True`. Maybe such a sanity check should also be performed if `linear_extension` is `False`? 

I propose to throw a `ValueError` if there are duplicates. Alternatively, it would be possible to clean up the list of elements instead of throwing an error.

I suppose that users can do something like `Poset(( f.roots()+g.roots(), lamda r1, r2: ... ))` and so we should allow duplicates in the element list if `linear_extension=False`.

I think this patch can go, modulo normal bikeshedding: exception message should not begin with a capital letter. Maybe it should even mention linear extension, i.e. "input contains duplicate elements and linear_extension=True".
