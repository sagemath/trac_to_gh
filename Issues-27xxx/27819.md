I added a sanity check for duplicate elements if `linear_extension` is set to `True`. Maybe such a sanity check should also be performed if `linear_extension` is `False`? 

I propose to throw a `ValueError` if there are duplicates. Alternatively, it would be possible to clean up the list of elements instead of throwing an error.
