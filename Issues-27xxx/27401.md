See [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54942165/differents-way-to-define-a-function-in-sagemath).

```
        from sage.rings.ideal import is_Ideal
        if not is_Ideal(I) or not I.ring() is self._parent:
            I = self._parent.ideal(I)
            #raise TypeError, "I = %s must be an ideal in %s"%(I, self.parent())
        return I.reduce(self)
```

Why the commented error?  Was that supposed to be raised in certain cases?

Anyway, the real problem (if it's a problem) is here:

```
sage: I = SR.ideal(x)
sage: I.reduce??
...
return f       # default
```

Well.
