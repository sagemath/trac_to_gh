From ​​https://www.csun.edu/~ctoth/Handbook/chap15.pdf:

The wedge over a facet `F` of a polytope `P` is defined as:

`(P \times \mathbb{R}) \cap \{a^\top x +|x_{d+1}| \leq b\}`

where `F` is a facet defined by `a^\top x leq b`.

It  has  dimension `d+1`, `m+1` facets, and `2n-n_F` vertices, if `F` has `n_F` vertices. More generally,  the wedge construction can be performed (defined by the same formula) for a face `F`.

Hi,

* In the docstring, it usually starts with 1 sentence, and empty line and then further information about the method.

* I would say that the width is a "indication of how wide the wedge is taken around the face". Said the current way, it makes it confusing about other potential notions around polytopes (lattice polytopes have widths...) So I would say: "indication of how wide the resulted wedge should be".

* The doctests are not using the function as a method. 

* Replace the backtick by single quotes in the error messages.

* `L = Polyhedron(rays=[[1],[-1]])` could be `Polyhedron(lines=[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))`

* I would write `F_Hrep = list(F_Hrep)` after the for loop and replace in the creation of the polytope.

* It would be good to test and show in examples combinatorial isomorphism type with a known polytope which is a wedge. For example the prism over a triangle is a wedge over a triangle. And the duals to cyclic 3-polytopes are wedges.

Actually, I think the backend might be preserved. (product and intersection might behave this way).

Can you please check. Maybe add a doctest.

However, in the intermediate steps you don't preserve the backend. This might cause issues with algebraic polyhedra.

The backend and the basering are preserved as long as the value of `width` belongs to the basering of `self`. This is the case when `width` takes the default value. Otherwise, we have the following behavior

```
sage: P = polytopes.cyclic_polytope(3,7); P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 7 vertices
sage: P.backend()
'ppl'
sage: P.wedge(P.faces(2)[0]).backend()
'ppl'
sage: P.wedge(P.faces(2)[0]).base_ring()
Rational Field
sage: P.wedge(P.faces(2)[0], width=RDF(1)).backend()
cdd
sage: P.wedge(P.faces(2)[0], width=RDF(1)).base_ring()
Real Double Field
```
which I think is an acceptable behavior.

The examples you gave are not meaningful. ppl and cdd are the standard backends for the given ring.

What about normaliz with base ring ZZ and width 5/2 (even worse 4/2)? (I suspect backend will not be preserved).

What about the examples of #25097. Do they work?

(Sorry, still can't test it myself).

Is this `ZZ.one()` really needed? Base extend should work recognize `1` as well.

Can you add `base_ring=self.base_ring()` and same for backend to initialization of L. (Setting up the correct base ring right away, avoids coercion for the product to my understanding.)

A note: in Sage `4/2` is rational:

```
sage: type(4/2)
<class 'sage.rings.rational.Rational'>
```

and it should be like that, not to create nightmares.

Hence, taking `width=4/2`, the expected behavior is *really* to change the base ring to rational numbers.

In Sage dividing two `Integers` yields an element in the FractionField, i.e. the rationals. It is the users responsibility to know these things. Just like `2.0` is not an integer.

That said, it is completely fine to have `base_ring=QQ` but integral vertices. The goal of base ring is not to steadily represent the smallest ring in which the vertices lay in.

I was aware of `4/2` being rational.
I just find it awful to change the backend when you enter rational width.
The backend should never change unintentionally unless necessary (so if you enter `width=2.0` the backend will change to cdd, which I would consider the expected behavior.)

It's just annoying when you want to use `normaliz` and every operation ignores your preference and you have to change backend over and over (and even worse calculations might take longer time with `ppl`, which you decided not to use in the first place).

> Base extend should work recognize `1` as well.

Not anymore after the last commit I did. `ZZ.one()` is really needed now. The `width` should have a `base_ring`method in order for the wedge to work.

> Can you add `base_ring=self.base_ring()` and same for backend to initialization of L. (Setting up the correct base ring right away, avoids coercion for the product to my understanding.)

This might produce problems due to the following behavior:

```
sage: Polyhedron(lines=[[1]])
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
sage: Polyhedron(lines=[[1]], base_ring=AA)
The empty polyhedron in AA^1
sage: Polyhedron(lines=[[1]], base_ring=AA, backend='normaliz')
A 1-dimensional polyhedron in AA^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 1 line
```


The backend should now be preserved as long as this is possible. The base ring will change to the field of fractions of the current base ring, if width takes the default value 1. This is really needed because the base ring for the vertices is either the base ring for the ieqs or its field of fractions

Most importantly the `normaliz` tests should be marked optional as `pynormaliz` cannot be assumed to be installed.
Alternatively, you can switch to backend `field` for the tests, this demonstrates as well that the backend is preserved.

The current code does not work with width a python integer ect.
How about `parent = self.parent().base_extend(width/1, …`, I believe this works as well.
Then a default `width=1` would be fine as well.
As of #27926 `parent.base_extend` works with elements of rings and numbers that can be interpreted as such.

In python3 (resp. python2), `x = 1/1; type(x)` gives `<class 'float'>` (resp. `<type 'int'>`), which does not have a `.base_ring()`. I need `.base_ring()` so I can find its `.fraction_field()`.

Having `ZZ.one()` as default instead of python `1` solves the problem for the default value. If the value of `width` is not the default value, then it is a sage ring element. This solves the problem for non-default values.

`parent._coerce_base_ring(1/1)` gives rational field, which tells me that base extend works fine.
Don't worry about passing a ring to `Polyhedra.base_extend`.
Probably you should pass `1/width` as argument `base_ring`:

```diff
-        parent = self.parent().base_extend(width.base_ring().fraction_field(),\
+        parent = self.parent().base_extend(1/width,\
                                             ambient_dim=self.ambient_dim()+1)
```

This extends the ring of parent, such that `1/width` is an element.
There is a number of occasions, where I used `base_extend` this way to have polyhedral operations respect the base ring.

No. If you write a python script that uses this method, you will have to import `Integer` from sage as well to be able to pass `width`.
Something as `1l` or `1L` or `float(0.9)` should work as well.

Actually you need to use `ZZ.one()/width` (not `1/width`), which should do the trick. Sorry about the confusion.
Alternatively, you find a method to map `width` to a sage ring element and then still do the fraction field.

I do not get at all all this fuss.

The default of `width` should be set to `None`. If no value is given, the algorithm will fetch the base ring of the object and take `.one()` of that base ring and continue with that value.

If the user gives a weird value for the width, that's the user's problem (the whole `Polyhedron` class is based on this principle). It is not at all expected that the base ring is preserved. Only if possible (which is handled by the intersection method...

The only thing that matters is the backend. Thus the returned polyhedron should have the right backend...

I fail to see the issue here.

`H` should be well-defined and with correct backend. This is what we need `base_extend` for.
I didn't check if we really need the value `1/width`.
I don't find a python integer to be a overly strange input.
Especially, since we already put in the effort to make our default work.

Using standard constructor for `H` with backend argument can result in an error, when the backend doesn't support `width`.
Standard constructor without backend argument, will not preserve backend, e.g. with `self` being integral.

`base_extend` does preserve backend whenever possible, which is exactly what we want.

Btw, can't we just write down all equations and inequalities right away.
This saves the time of calculating double description for two (possibly large) intermediate polyhedra.

`H` is a totally well defined object on whatever reasonable given value of `width` that is given by the user. There is no such thing as correct backend at this stage. All you would do is try to do a good guess before `intersection` will proceed to do exactly the same, but with the help of coercion. So why try to do things twice?

If the user doesn't say a word, then for sure we should just take a width from the same base ring. Then, the story with backend is irrelevant since this should be taken care of in the intersection method, and not in this specific place.

The code is barely 15 lines long... ;-)

> Using standard constructor for `H` with backend argument can result in an error, when the backend doesn't support `width`.

Now I see what you mean. But again that business should be taken care of by intersection, and not here.

Agreed. But this is a hack, and I do not like that solution. Further, one line after `H` is defined it is passed right away to intersection.

> Btw, can't we just write down all equations and inequalities right away.
> This saves the time of calculating double description for two (possibly large) intermediate polyhedra.

Yes, and the long term idea is to have intersection do this kind of redundancy checks using `normaliz` tools. (long term...) Once adding inequalities dynamically will be readily available in Sage, we can talk about it again. For now, I don't think we have to deal with this in this ticket.

In the end, the wedge is the intersection of an infinite prism over the given polyhedron (trivial to keep base ring and backend) and an infinite `keil` defined by two inequalities. The base ring of this `keil` is decided by the type of `width`, and the backend should also be decided from the type of `width`.

Then, the decision for the backend of the intersection should be delegated to `.intersection` method. Why all the fuss here in wedge? If the user gives a float width and had normaliz as a backend, why should it stay normaliz? It can't!

The coercion will just figure out the right object and backend... This is already taken care of in intersection.

The following illustrates exactly the behavior that I expect to happen in `wedge`:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(rays=[[1,0],[0,1]],base_ring=RDF)
sage: Q = Polyhedron(rays=[[-1,0],[0,1]],vertices=[[1,0]],backend='normaliz')
sage: P & Q
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in RDF^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices and 1 ray
sage: P.backend()
'cdd'
sage: Q.backend()
'normaliz'
```

<a id='comment:45'></a>
The problem is not float. A float is going to change backend to `cdd`, which is fine.

Let `P` with parent `Polyhedra_normaliz_ZZ` and `Q` with parent `Polyhedra_ppl_QQ` then coercion will lead the intersection to be an element of `Polyhedra_ppl_QQ`, because there is a map in exactly one direction.

Hence, intersection might change the backend (it might prefer backend of `self` or `other` depending on the involved rings).
However, I would expect a user to create all polyhedra with his preferred backend, so that shouldn't cause issues.

Now, if we create a polyhedron `H` with default backend (and not what the user chose as backend of `self`) this might cause the `backend` to change. I think one could only prevent this by not using coercion for intersection.

I thought that the solution since the beginning is to query the backend of `self`and apply it to `H`. If it fails, well this is a bad day for the user, because the backend will have to change whatsoever, due to the type of input, which we should trust is what the user wants.

Hence, try to create `H` with the backend of self, it is fails, just create `H` using the type of the given width.

I would let `intersection` alone here and still trust it to do what is right when the time comes.

In the end, that the backend is not preserved by an operation which is not intended to, is not the end of the world. Is it?

This is exactly what `base_extend` does. It changes the parent as little as possible. Of course you can also use the constructor with `try` and `except`, which is what `base_extend` does (but cached).

It will always prefer the backend of the polyhedron with larger ring due to coercion.

It is a pain, if it could have been prevented. If working with large polyhedra, which are manageable with `normaliz` and take forever with `ppl` you don't want the backend to change.

To ask a user to to `base_extend` before wedge over face is very sudle.

In many cases polyhedra will by default be set up with base ring `ZZ` like in

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex(backend='normaliz'); type(P)
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_normaliz_with_category.element_class'>
```

If a user wants to keep his backend and we ask him to change the base ring to `QQ` before doing wedge over face, this is confusing.

Tried to simplify construction of `H`.

Btw, I also tried to preserve the `base_ring` (when width is 1), but this did not work for the test in line 4205.

The sentence:

```diff
+        The base_ring will change to the field of fractions of the current
+        base_ring, unless width forces a different ring.
```

is still confusing as it says that the base ring always will change to the field of fractions. What if it stays as ZZ? (which is possible). This should be fixed...

The rest seems to be good.

I don't think so. `H` is constructed from inequalities without specifying the basering. In this case the constructor coerces the base rings of all values and then takes the fraction field. If you want `ZZ` as basering when constructing a polyhedron from inequalities, you need to specify it for the constructor.
