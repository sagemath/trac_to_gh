This :

* builds at first attempt ;
* passes its own test suite (modulo numerical noise and expected failures) ;
* installs my current library of 468 extra packages at first attempt ;
* passes `ptestlong` with no failure whatsoever.

==> `needs_review`. As usual, special attention on Mac OS X is sought (changes in the prerequisites for C++)...

On  OSX 10.13, while running R's self-tests I see

Please always (for the time being anyways until the buildbot is more stable) give me a chance to review any major package version updates before setting them to "positive review".

The R developers in particular have been historically hostile toward Cygwin support...

That's what I called "numerical noise".

Okay, Madison, I'll try to remember this.

But you'll get to be CC'd on any such change.... ;-).

Do you think you'll be able to review this in time for 8.8 ?

Yes, I promise.  I'm just now waiting for my `make ptestlong` of 8.8.beta5 to finish then I can do it.

There probably won't be any major problems, but as there was at least a 3.5.x to 3.6.x bump I could imagine there being new build system problems or something like that.
