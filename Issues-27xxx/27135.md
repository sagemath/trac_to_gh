Clean
- `Complete`
- `Circuit`
- `Circulant`

In both `Circuit` and `Circulant`, we also avoid creating the list of edges before adding it to the digraph (small speed up)

In the documentation of `Circuit`, there are missing periods at the ends of sentences.

In `Circulant`, the 3 occurrences of `relative integers` should just be `integers` (I guess this is a French-to-English thing). 

Feel free to set to positive review after fixing.
