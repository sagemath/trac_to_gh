This enhancement makes text labels appear much sharper and clearer on high-density screens. It should have no effect on screens with normal density.

If no machine with a high-density screen is available, please just confirm that it does not cause any unexpected problems. I've been using this enhancement in my own JavaScript library for some time, so I know it works for my devices.
