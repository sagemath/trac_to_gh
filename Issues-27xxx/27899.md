    "body": "<a id='comment:2'></a>\nAs a general rule, the `[]` counts as an operator (and I often treat (tuple creation) `()` as one too), and so by PEP8, you do not need the spacing inside. For example, `foo[i+1]`. In some cases, I think adding the extra spaces makes it a little harder to read. This is bikeshedding, and since you have already done the changes, I am not going to oppose. However, perhaps you would be willing to take a little more care about these things in the future. (I do not mean to sound unappreciative for all the work you have been doing improving the code. Maybe I am just also used to seeing it the \"wrong\" way too.)",
