Trying to "group" the coefficients like

```
sage: P.<a, b, n> = QQ[]
sage: N = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'n')
sage: AB = PolynomialRing(N, 'a, b')
sage: AB(a*n + a*n^2)
```
fails with 

```
TypeError: not a constant polynomial
```
but the result should be

```
(n + n^2)*a
```

As an interesting side note, the Laurent polynomial ring can do it:

```
sage: L = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'a, b, n')
sage: LN = LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'n')
sage: LAB = LaurentPolynomialRing(LN, 'a, b')
sage: LAB(L(a*n + a*n^2))
(n + n^2)*a
```

The Laurent polynomial ring can do this since #21855. And #22333 is about reusing this code, so there is a good chance that #22333 fixes this as well.

Depends on #22333

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
