Indeed, `pplpy` depends on sphinx (for building the documentation) and this is not specified in `build/pkgs/pplpy/dependencies`.

I get this problem, but also even with this branch, another problem:

```
    ppl/linear_algebra.cpp:8:17: warning: '/*' within block comment [-Wcomment]
                "ppl/*",
                    ^

    #include "ppl.hh"
             ^~~~~~~~
    1 warning and 1 error generated.
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```
Should `ppl` be a dependency? It is listed as a requirement at the [pplpy gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy).
