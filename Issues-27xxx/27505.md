This needs a doctest, but I am not sure how to make a minimal one.

I triggered the problem when starting from a .dot file made by pyan, converting to networkx using pydot, and then trying to convert to sage

```
sage: import networkx
sage: import pydot
sage: with open('pachbot.dot') as f:
....:     pg = pydot.graph_from_dot_data(f.read())
....:     
sage: 
sage: G=networkx.nx_pydot.from_pydot(pg[0])
sage: dg=Graph(G,format='NX',loops=True)
```
