The Python package [defusedxml](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)
addresses some vulnerabilities of XML parsers.

It is a new dependency of the [nbconvert](https://pypi.org/project/nbconvert/)
standard spkg, starting from nbconvert 5.4, to which we upgraded in #26969.

In this ticket, we therefore
- add defusedxml as a standard spkg, skipping the "optional" phase
- update nbconvert dependencies

As reported in
[this sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-release/ULwr6YtMfnY/UpPKqXmxDAAJ), the absence of defusedxml breaks the Jupyter notebook in Sage 8.7.beta0: opening a notebook file (either a new one or a pre-existing one) results in 

```
500 : Internal Server Error
```
the reason being

```
ImportError: No module named defusedxml
```
Note that anyone using Sage 8.7.beta0 can run

```
sage --pip install defusedxml
```
as a simple workaround which will make Jupyter notebooks work again.

Does the file `build/pkgs/nbconvert/dependencies` also need updating?

Currently it just has

```
$(PYTHON) | pip entrypoints pygments mistune pandocfilters testpath
```

Compare to the following, found in
[nbconvert's setup.py at line 215](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/master/setup.py#L215):

```
install_requires = setuptools_args['install_requires'] = [
