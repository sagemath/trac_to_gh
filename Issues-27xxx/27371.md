It should simply try the base type and relabel the diagram appropriately, cf.:

Late thanks for solving this so immediately!

BTW: I observed this bug when I tried to generalize a wrapper for the `CHEVIE cyclotomic Hecke algebra` representations which I implemented more than a year ago. At that time I was working on a class on `cubic Hecke algebras` and I focused on `ST 4, 25` and `32`. Now, I have a version which works pretty good for most of the remaining cases (the bug I reported occurred when I checked the results using the `braid_relation` method of complex reflection groups).

Does it make sense to have such a wrapper available in sage? If so, is that under work, already?

To this aim it first determines a set of indeterminats\n    such that an appropriate power of them cover all spectra of non conjugated generators. If they\n    don't occur in denominators of the representation matrices entries then a multivariate polynomial\n    ring will be chosen. Else, if just monomials occur in the denominators, a multivariate Laurent\n    polynomial ring is chosen. Else the field of fraction of the multivariate polynomial ring will\n    be taken.\n\n    The base ring of the polynomials is chosen according to the coefficients returned by GAP3. As\n    long as they are integral or roots of unity the base ring will be a quotient ring of ZZ[x] by\n    an appropriate cyclotomic polynomial or ZZ. In case division by integers != 1,-1 is needed the\n    base ring will be QQ or an appropriate cyclotomic field.\n\n    INPUT:\n\n     - ``ReflectGroup`` -- instance of ComplexReflectionGroup to which the cyclotomic Hecke algebra\n       is considered\n     - ``number``  --  integer (optional, defaults to all)  number of the representation according\n       to CHEVIE's enumeration\n     - ``generic`` --  boolean (optional, default True) if set to False the base ring is set to the\n       field of fractions of a multivariate polynomial ring over the universal cyclotomic field.\n       In the default case the function tries to find a more generic base ring allowing positive\n       characteristic and specialization of indeterminats.\n```\n\nAs you can see my aim is, to have the representation matrices implemented over the most generic ring for example:\n\n```\nIrreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST4\nBase ring: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x02 over Integer Ring\n\nIrreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST7\nBase ring: Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x10, x11, x12, x20, x21, x22 over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in e3bar over Integer Ring with modulus e3^2 + e3 + 1\n```\n\n\nBut there are cases where I don't know how to do that faithfully in Sage. You would need to localize a ring at a certain couple of elements (occurring in the denominators of the CHEVIE results), for example the Ariki-Koike algebra for `r=3` and `n=3`:\n\n```\nIrreducible complex reflection group of rank 3 and type G(3,1,3)\nBase ring: Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x02, x10, x11 over Integer Ring\n```\n\nComparing with ticket #20469 you would have to set `x00=u0, x01=u1, x02=u2, x10=-1, x11=q`. I took the fraction field, since you have these denominators:\n\n```\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m1.list()])\n{1}\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m2.list()])\n{1, x00 - x01, x01 - x02, x00 - x02}\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m3.list()])\n{1, x02*x10 + x00*x11, x00 - x01, x01 - x02, x01*x10 + x02*x11, x00 - x02, x02*x10 + x01*x11, x10 - x11, x01*x10 + x00*x11, x00*x10 + x01*x11, x00*x10 + x02*x11}\n```\n\nBut unfortunately this cancels the possibility to specialize the indeterminats! Another example:\n\n```\nIrreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST27\nBase ring: Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x00, x01 over Cyclotomic Field of order 60 and degree 16\n```\n\nHere I took the cyclotomic field, since division by 2 must work.\n\n```\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m1.list()])\n{1}\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m2.list()])\n{1}\nsage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m3.list()])\n{1, 2}\n```\n\nThis cancels characteristic > 2!\n\nHow can I obtain a more general base ring in such cases (that is localize at elements)?",

I've seen the ticket about the Ariki-Koike algebra. It seems, that no matrix representation is included, so far. So, the wrapper could by used as an extension.
BTW: I am not very close to Ariki-Koike algebras, but if there is a need I can try to help on that ticket.

What I have already done concerning the wrapper is the following function:

```
def cyclotomic_hecke_representation_from_chevie(ReflectGroup, number=None, generic=True):
    r"""
    This function reads in irreducible representations of cyclotomic Hecke algebras via the gap3
    interface from CHEVIE (see GAP3-manual 76.7).

    It tries to find a most generic base ring. To this aim it first determines a set of indeterminats
    such that an appropriate power of them cover all spectra of non conjugated generators. If they
    don't occur in denominators of the representation matrices entries then a multivariate polynomial
    ring will be chosen. Else, if just monomials occur in the denominators, a multivariate Laurent
    polynomial ring is chosen. Else the field of fraction of the multivariate polynomial ring will
    be taken.

    The base ring of the polynomials is chosen according to the coefficients returned by GAP3. As
    long as they are integral or roots of unity the base ring will be a quotient ring of ZZ[x] by
    an appropriate cyclotomic polynomial or ZZ. In case division by integers != 1,-1 is needed the
    base ring will be QQ or an appropriate cyclotomic field.

    INPUT:

     - ``ReflectGroup`` -- instance of ComplexReflectionGroup to which the cyclotomic Hecke algebra
       is considered
     - ``number``  --  integer (optional, defaults to all)  number of the representation according
       to CHEVIE's enumeration
     - ``generic`` --  boolean (optional, default True) if set to False the base ring is set to the
       field of fractions of a multivariate polynomial ring over the universal cyclotomic field.
       In the default case the function tries to find a more generic base ring allowing positive
       characteristic and specialization of indeterminats.

As you can see my aim is, to have the representation matrices implemented over the most generic ring for example:

```
Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST4
Base ring: Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x02 over Integer Ring

Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST7
Base ring: Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x10, x11, x12, x20, x21, x22 over Univariate Quotient Polynomial Ring in e3bar over Integer Ring with modulus e3^2 + e3 + 1
```


But there are cases where I don't know how to do that faithfully in Sage. You would need to localize a ring at a certain couple of elements (occurring in the denominators of the CHEVIE results), for example the Ariki-Koike algebra for `r=3` and `n=3`:

```
Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 3 and type G(3,1,3)
Base ring: Fraction Field of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x00, x01, x02, x10, x11 over Integer Ring
```

Comparing with ticket #20469 you would have to set `x00=u0, x01=u1, x02=u2, x10=-1, x11=q`. I took the fraction field, since you have these denominators:

```
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m1.list()])
{1}
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m2.list()])
{1, x00 - x01, x01 - x02, x00 - x02}
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m3.list()])
{1, x02*x10 + x00*x11, x00 - x01, x01 - x02, x01*x10 + x02*x11, x00 - x02, x02*x10 + x01*x11, x10 - x11, x01*x10 + x00*x11, x00*x10 + x01*x11, x00*x10 + x02*x11}
```

But unfortunately this cancels the possibility to specialize the indeterminats! Another example:

```
Irreducible complex reflection group of rank 2 and type ST27
Base ring: Multivariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in x00, x01 over Cyclotomic Field of order 60 and degree 16
```

Here I took the cyclotomic field, since division by 2 must work.

```
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m1.list()])
{1}
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m2.list()])
{1}
sage: Set([elem.denominator() for elem in m3.list()])
{1, 2}
```

This cancels characteristic > 2!

How can I obtain a more general base ring in such cases (that is localize at elements)?
