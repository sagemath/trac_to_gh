To simplify installation of polymake, we add some required CPAN packages. 

Including recursive dependencies, these are 103 packages, a total of 7.5 MB of source archives, which we pack up as the source tar ball of the new spkg `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq`.
The source tar ball (attached) also contains a copy of the self-contained `cpanm` Perl script, which is used for installing the packages.
If `SAGE_CHECK=no`, only about 35 packages are installed. The rest of the dependencies are for testing.

Using an `spkg-configure.m4`, it is downloaded and installed only if the Perl packages are not already present on the system.

The `spkg-install` installs the packages via the package dependencies mechanism. If some of the packages are already installed in some version on the system, we do not install a newer version.

To try out:

```
   wget -P upstream https://trac.sagemath.org/raw-attachment/ticket/27763/perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19.tar.gz
```

I'd suggest to have appropriate `spkg-configure.m4`, to avoid installing extra...

By the way, could you provide  `spkg-configure.m4` for `perl_term_readline_gnu`, and other already present as packages `polymake` deps (perl or not)?

Do you have a suggestion how to install these CPAN packages if they are not available?
There seems to be a large number of dependencies that each of the listed packages pulls in -- but probably many are "standard" on any system that has perl installed.

I have only used  `cpan -i`, which asks whether to install system wide or in the user's home directory.
Here's some info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/540640/how-can-i-install-a-cpan-module-into-a-local-directory

I used something like this for `perl_term_readline_gnu`, but this is not going through cpan.

I don't know, it seems one needs to setup some `local::lib` magic, otherwise I keep getting errors trying to to install into `/usr/local`.

`local::lib` is a Perl module that apparently allows one to use non-standard directories for module installation, it might not be in by default (e.g. it's not in Gentoo, one needs to install it).

Anyhow - for checking in autoconf which perl modules are installed, one can use [AX_PROG_PERL_MODULES](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_prog_perl_modules.html)

How about adding checks for all the needed perl packages in the style of #27795 to polymake itself?
Actually, it would be easier (per package), as `Term::ReadLine::Gnu` is non-standard in the sense one cannot just `use` it.

As usual, they pay a usability price by not using autotools :-)

polymake itself does check for the packages needed at build time in its configure script.
The MongoDB package is checked at run time of polymake for the optional polyDB feature.

The challenge in this ticket is to make the installation of missing Perl packages not depend on internet access.
Here's a possible approach.

First install `App::cpanminus`. 
Then 

```
cpanm --local-lib-contained $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT --exclude-vendor --save-dists $PARTIAL_CPAN_MIRROR XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp Term::ReadLine::Gnu JSON SVG MongoDB
```
will (1) download and install these prerequisites in $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT,
(2) save the source packages in a directory tree $PARTIAL_CPAN_MIRROR.

These are 58 packages, a total of 5 MB of source archives, which we can pack up as the source tar ball of the new spkg `perl_cpan_polymake_prereq`. 

Then figure out how to install with plain `cpan` (not `cpanm`, which is not available out of the box on macOS) using this local partial CPAN mirror.

By `local package` you mean `system package`, right?

Can you uninstall Sage's `perm_term_readline_gnu` and then in terminal run

```
perl -e "use Term::ReadLine; Term::ReadLine->get_all_function_names" 
```
- there should be no output if `perm_term_readline_gnu` is installed, and an error message otherwise.

when I wrote #27795 I was under impression that perl is isolated from sage's "vendored madness" libraries, as it is an independent executable, just like, say, bash.

if the problem is indeed as you described then the right way forward is to get #27277 reviewed and merged.then readline wont get built if it is available.

Yes, the Perl executable is fine, but the myriad of CPAN packages link to lots of libraries.

yes, I understand this, but I imagine the only conflicts of this sort are possible if you run polymake as a python extension, that loads a wrong dll at runtime.

As I don't know how the polymake interface works, I can't tell whether this is the case.

In any case, could you explain where these *.so parts of perl packages may be found, so that I can look at them with ldd/otool ?

If there is indeed a possible problem like this, build/pkgs/perl_term_readline_gnu/spkg-configure.m4 needs to be modified to include a check for readline.

I would actually be more worried about a potential conflict between an incompatible readline library, say, on OSX, and the one built by Sage (or provided by Homebrew/MacPorts)...

Yes, I met `system package`.

Ok, so here is the outcome.

I ran the command 

`perl -e "use Term::ReadLine; Term::ReadLine->get_all_function_names"`

before uninstalling `perl_term_readline_gnu`: No output.

After uninstalling (inside of sage shell using the `sage-spkg-uninstall` command) I still get no output.

Things now seems to work flawlessly using the interface though.

Running `./configure`, I do check the `(configure check)`.

Ok, so now it seems to catch the system `Term ReadLine`. I believe I know how it happened: I did install the perl libraries using `cpan -i XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT File::Slurp JSON SVG` as the `sage -info polymake` suggested, but then, the installation of the polymake package was not preceeded by a rerun of `./configure` to catch the libraries that are now meanwhile to be found in my PATH?

If I run it on a clean computer, without the spkg `perl_term_readline_gnu` (and without any installation of the required perl libraries) I do get the error message (that now looks quite familiar to the one I was getting in Sage originally).

Ok, so in the end, I do not think there is an issue: I'll test it on fresh untouched debian machines to have a clean feedback.

well, this is by (somewhat unfortunate) design. Once you updated ./configure by installing/updating a `spkg-configure.m4` file in build/pkgs/foo/
and you have foo installed in Sage and as a system package, the only way to switch from Sage-installed to system foo is to manually uninstall Sage's foo, and then re-run configure (othewise configure would check, and succeed in this, for Sage's foo first).

The main reason for that that some people do not want to retire the old `sage -f foo` as a way to install/update a package, see e.g. #27373...

A user would install local::lib into their local library by "bootstrapping" https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique

But this is not relevant for us.

Thanks for testing! This is the correct procedure. 

The relevant failure from your test on Mac is this one:

I have made a more robust version of the `spkg-src` script, which (hopefully!) makes sure to pack up all dependencies (instead of picking some up from the local installation) and also addresses the `Module::Runtime` version problem on macOS.

To test, first get rid of the Perl library installation in $SAGE_LOCAL and then reinstall the packages:

```
  rm -rf local/lib/perl5
  ./sage -f  perl_cpan_polymake_prereq perl_term_readline_gnu

I have attached a log of a failed installation of polymake on macOS Mojave after pulling this ticket and doing the following steps.

- pulled the branch on this ticket
- downloaded the tarball perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19.tar.gz and put it in the upstream folder
- in upstream folder typed `rm perl_cpan_polymake_prereq_2019_05_13.tar.gz`
- in my sage directory typed `make build`
- typed `./sage -f perl_term_readline_gnu`
- typed `./sage -i polymake`

perl_cpan_polymake_prereq-2019-05-19 installed successfully.

why would you download the file, and then delete it? A typo?

I wonder why you have C++14 in your CXXFLAGS.
Do you by any chance have CXXFLAGS environment variable set to something non-empty?

Try deleting the installed polymake headers in local/include first.
Looks like they are taking precedence in the compilation - this looks like a bug in the polymake build scripts

From `sage -info polymake`:

```
On Mac OS X, to build Term::Readline::Gnu, on macOS 10.14 (Mojave), one
needs to do the following:

 sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /

or a "fatal error: 'EXTERN.h' file not found" will be signalled.
```

After a clean installation of 9.1.beta2, running `sage -i polymake` finishes with success and installs both

- perl_cpan_polymake_prereq...............2019-05-19 (2019-05-19)
- perl_term_readline_gnu..................1.35 (1.35)

Now, trying out polymake in sage essentially does not work...

- Tab completion on `polymake.` does not work (which is an improvement, before it used to kill sage)
- If I type `c = polytopes.cube(backend='polymake')` it simply never finishes. Thought I can kill it succesfully with ctrl+c.

Starting sage anew and trying:
- `p = Polyhedron(vertices= [[0],[1]],backend='polymake')` also simply never gives back the prompt.

Without starting sage anew, if I simply repeat the previous operation, I get directly:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: argument should be integer or bytes-like object, not 'str'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
...

/home/jplabbe/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/interface.py in __init__(self, parent, value, is_name, name)
    718                 self._name = parent._create(value, name=name)
    719             except (TypeError, RuntimeError, ValueError) as x:
--> 720                 raise TypeError(x)
    721 
    722     def _latex_(self):

TypeError: error evaluating "@SAGE1=("Rational");":
argument should be integer or bytes-like object, not 'str'
```


...

*That said*, I have to mention that I do not have jupymake installed which is an optional package:

jupymake................................0.9 (not_installed)

I wanted to try a simple "sage -i polymake" from a virgin install to see how it would perform...

My os is debian-buster. As far as the installation goes, it seems that polymake runs fine under `sage -polymake`...
