There is a problem in the Cygwin package repository where there is a version of the libvpx package that is compiled against a newer version of the Cygwin DLL than is properly set in its dependencies.

The result is that if the libvpx-devel system package is installed, when compiling libgd it will enable vpx support but that doesn't actually work, and actually causes any DLLs linked to libgd (i.e. `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense`) to fail to load.
