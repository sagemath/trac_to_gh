Our plan with Ana Romero and her student is to keep working on a more complete interface between Kenzo and Sage. The long term idea is to be able to seamlessly translate simplicial sets back and forth. That includes writing some specific Kenzo code to be able to create simplicial sets from the kind of information that Sage uses to define them, and to output the kind of information that Sage would need.

Considering that, I would wait until we have that ready to redesign the interface used in those examples.

I added the missing import, and also made a version bump of the kenzo package, to include Dima's patch (tarball is in https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo/archive/1.1.7-r2.tar.gz ).

Can you please test it?

OK, this works. 
By the way, I'm not sure all the contents of the tarball should be there, e.g. archive/ and jupyter notebooks in examples.

You can create a slimmed down tarball and add to the release.

just to explain, I did the following, as an example:
https://github.com/dimpase/kenzo/releases/tag/test

there you see https://github.com/dimpase/kenzo/releases/download/test/kenzo-test.tar.gz
which is the copy of what I got after clicking on 
https://github.com/dimpase/kenzo/archive/test.tar.gz
and uploading back using "Edit" button.
While the latter tarball might change overtime, the former would not, and it also has the correct name.
