At the moment when calling `.affine_hull`, either the polyhedron or the affine map can be returned. If both needed, parts need to be recomputed, so we extend the parameters to allow returning both at the same time.

Moreover, we also allow to additionally return the section map, i.e., the right inverse of the projection map. This is a preparation for #27365 and #31659.

<a id='comment:25'></a>I plan to rework this so the output is a bit more straightforward.

We have `affine_map`, which is the projection that sends the affine hull (k-dimensional affine subspace of R<sup>n</sup>) to R<sup>k</sup>.

What's missing is simply its section map that sends back R<sup>k</sup> to the affine hull.

I think both `parametric_form` and `coordinate_images` somehow represent this section map.

As the section map is affine linear, we should represent it in the same way as `affine_map`: A linear transformation and a shift.

<a id='comment:33'></a>The behavior is actually consistent with rings, I still don't like it.

Looks, like this is related to #4621:

This is extremely stupid. At least it should throw an error instead of giving a false negative. But its pointless to be fixed here.

Edit: I realized that equality checks should never throw an error. So it is really hard to do the right thing here. The base ring of algebraic polyhedra has a specified embedding into `RLF`, which makes it incomparable with `AA`.

The test suite fails for `polytopes.Birkhoff(3)` terribly (the section map has incorrect rank).

It also fails for the 0-dimensional polyhedron, but maybe that is just the way it is.

It fails for unbounded polyhedron, in particular `Polyhedron(rays=[This is the Trac macro *0, 1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#0, 1-macro))`.

Apparently, the content of the matrix is never initialized. You might say that multiplication of those matrices isn't well-defined. However, if you think of this as linear maps, there is only one linear map from `RLF^0` to `RLF^2`.

<a id='comment:51'></a>This ticket should depend now on #30551, right?

Apparently `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base` is a startup module, which is terrible. I chased it down and it seems one needs to do a series of lazy/more careful imports.

- It starts with `sage/schemes/toric/all.py`, which just imports a everything right away.
- `sage/schemes/toric/variety.py` imports `Cone, is_Cone`. Both of them are only needed twice in the entire module and not even in popular places, it seems. (There are other places where `is_Cone` is just imported in the module, although it is only used in special methods.
- `sage/geometry/all.py` could just do a lot more lazy imports (I think all of them should be lazy).
- `sage/geometry/cone.py` could use a lot more careful imports. E.g. `FinitePoset` is imported, but it is only used for the face lattice. In particular the function `is_Cone` could live without all those imports. If your object isn't a cone, you probably won't need them anyway.

  In particular it imports `is_Polyhedron` in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base`.
- Again `sage/geometry/polyhedron/base.py` imports a lot of stuff that is definetly not needed for `is_Polyhedron`.

Adding some lazy imports above, I can avoid the import of `sage.geometry.polyhedron.base'.
