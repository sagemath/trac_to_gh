In sage I have discovered 2 ways to assign weight to edges :
either by edge labels
or by using a weight function as used by shortest_path function().

Currently networkx_graph() is adding weights to networkx graph graph as its edge labels. To unify the pattern of edge weights in Sage,this method should also have weight_function() variable to be passed. It would be required if we were to use implementations of networkx algorithms in weighted graphs.
