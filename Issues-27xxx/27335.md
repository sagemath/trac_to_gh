This was originally reported in #27267, but determined to be a distinct issue from another crash reported on that ticket.

This is easily reproduced on Cygwin:

```
sage: (2^127 - 1).is_prime()

*** SIG 11 *** inside sig_on

   5145             return self.__pari__().ispseudoprime()

cypari2/gen.pyx in cypari2.gen.Gen.isprime()

The C stack trace in the case of these crashes looks like:

It can also be reproduced on Linux, but only after forcing some unaccessible memory:

```
>>> import os, mmap; from cypari2 import Pari; pari = Pari()
>>> z = open("/dev/zero"); m = mmap.mmap(z.fileno(), 2**30, prot=0)
>>> pari.allocatemem(2**32)
PARI stack size set to 4294967296 bytes, maximum size set to 4294967296
>>> pari(2**127 - 1).isprime()
sys:1: RuntimeWarning: cypari2 leaked 5704 bytes on the PARI stack
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "cypari2/gen.pyx", line 2077, in cypari2.gen.Gen.isprime

```

<a id='comment:27'></a>Replying to [comment:25 embray]:
> or perhaps that's within some page alignment?


I think I was on to something with this conjecture.

```
On Cygwin sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) cannot be relied on to accurately
page-align the top of the PARI stack, because it does not actually give
the correct physical page size (this is intentional, as a compromise
with POSIX requirements that are incompatible with most Windows
versions; see
https://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-patches/2016-q4/msg00002.html)

Normally, the value returned by sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE) is actually
larger than the physical page size, which can result in placing the
top of the pari_mainstack a little past the real end of the allocated
memory region.

As it happens, the mem_unit member returned by sysinfo() does, however,
give the correct page size on Cygwin.
```

I want to run a full build/test of Sage with this patch, but at least in isolation it appears to do the trick.

What I still don't fully understand is why I never saw this bug before cypari2.  Is it possible that it just plays closer to the top of the stack when doing operations in a freshly initialized `Pari`?

which can result in placing the

If this were true, then we would be hitting segmentation faults all the time, not just in this particular `isprime()` function.

The patch might just accidentally work around the bug by changing memory locations or something, but I don't see how it would fix anything.

So in the `while` loop the last `*++Nd` attempts to dereference the address at the top of the stack and this is where it segfaults.

Now, this *should* work, and my patch fixes that.  I'm less certain exactly why though, and am beginning to suspect some bug/subtlety in Cygwin with page boundaries and mmap.  This is the test program that led me to my fix:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/errno.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


size_t PARI_STACK_ALIGN = 4096;
#define SIZE 1000000


static void mainstack_mreset(void*, void*);


static size_t fix_size(size_t a)
{
    size_t ps = PARI_STACK_ALIGN;
    size_t b = a & ~(ps - 1);
    if (b < a && b < ~(ps - 1)) b += ps;
    return b;
}


int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    void *b;
    size_t align;
    size_t size;
    if (argc == 2 && atoi(argv[1]) == 1) {
        PARI_STACK_ALIGN = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
    }

    size = fix_size(SIZE);

    b = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
             MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_NORESERVE, -1, 0);

    printf("PARI_STACK_ALIGN = 0x%lx\n", PARI_STACK_ALIGN);
    printf("size = 0x%lx\n", size);
    printf("bot = 0x%lx\n", b);
    printf("top = 0x%lx\n", b + size);
    printf("*(char*)bot = 0x%lx\n", *(char*)(b));
    printf("*(char*)(top - 1) = 0x%lx\n", *(char*)((b + size) - 1));
    printf("*(char*)top = 0x%lx\n", *(char*)(b + size));
    printf("*(int*)top = 0x%lx\n", *(int*)(b + size));
    return 0;
}
```

When run like `./test 0` it uses 4096 as the page size (which the actual value on Windows):

```
$ ./test.exe 0
PARI_STACK_ALIGN = 0x1000
size = 0xf5000
bot = 0x6fffff00000
top = 0x6ffffff5000
*(char*)bot = 0x0
*(char*)(top - 1) = 0x0
*(char*)top = 0x0
*(int*)top = 0x0
```

When run like `./test 1` it uses `sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)` (which is 64k):

```
$ ./test.exe 1
PARI_STACK_ALIGN = 0x10000
size = 0x100000
bot = 0x6fffff00000
top = 0x70000000000
*(char*)bot = 0x0
*(char*)(top - 1) = 0x0
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Somewhat to my surprise this also holds with or without `MAP_NORESERVE` so I don't think that's related, though it could have been.

So it seems to me that the "allocation granularity" is the right measure to use after all.

> Similarly on Linux I guess it just happened that you had readable memory at that location


Indeed.

> unless you forcibly do a `MAP_FIXED` mmap there with `PROT_NONE` or something. 


Well, doing an `mmap` of `/dev/zero` with `PROT_NONE` was sufficient (this used to be in the ticket description before you accidentally reverted it)

Yes, apparently so.  Last time I was bitten by this it was because I wanted to make memory usage calculations given a page count, and in that case using it for the page size was actually wrong, but not in this case.

In this case it gave me behavior I *wanted* (accessing that memory address did not cause an access violation) but what I wanted was also wrong in the first place.

> Well, doing an `mmap` of `/dev/zero` with `PROT_NONE` was sufficient (this used to be in the ticket description before you accidentally reverted it)


Oops, sorry.
