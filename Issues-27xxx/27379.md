- Don't call `_repr_()` on the parents every time a coercion or conversion fails. (One could consider making `Parent.__repr__()` keep the name in cache instead, but we probably don't want that for things like finite fields, and in any case `__repr__()` is handled by `SageObject` at the moment.)
- Add a fast path for trivial coercions in `Parent.coerce(foo)`.

Before:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x(a,a,a)
The slowest run took 37.44 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.1 µs per loop
```
After:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x(a,a,a)
The slowest run took 162.14 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.98 µs per loop
```

LGTM.

I do not think we want to cache the result of `Parent.__repr__` because that is designed so you can dynamically change the repr of the object via `foo.rename('bar')`.

Thank you!

Yes, that's an additional reason, though one could imagine making `rename()` update the cache.
