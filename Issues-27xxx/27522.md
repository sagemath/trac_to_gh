I don't understand the line

```
M = M // 2
```

in your code. If I uncomment it I'm getting the correct result.


BTW: Wouldn't it by useful, to introduce a second option to obtain the *Conway polynomial* via the *Homfly polynomial* for cross check purpose?


```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
sage: L41 = Link(B([1, -2, 1, -2]))
sage: h41 = L41.homfly_polynomial(normalization='az'); h41
L^2 - M^2 - 1 + L^-2
sage: c41 = L41.conway_polynomial(); c41
1 - t^2
sage: t, = c41.variables()
sage:  hc41 = h41(1,t); hc41
1 - t^2
sage: hc41 == c41
True
```


Since now we have Puiseux series available the *Homfly polynomial* can also easily be used for cross checks with *Alexander* and *Jones polynomials*:


```
sage: a41 = L41.alexander_polynomial(); a41
-t^-1 + 3 - t
sage: j41 = L41.jones_polynomial(); j41
t^2 - t - 1/t + 1/t^2 + 1

sage: P.<t> = PuiseuxSeriesRing(ZZ)
sage: ha41 = h41(1,t^(-1/2) -t^(1/2)); ha41
-t^-1 + 3 - t
sage: ha41.laurent_series().laurent_polynomial() == a41
True

sage: hj41 = h41(~t,t^(-1/2) -t^(1/2)); hj41
t^-2 - t^-1 + 1 - t + t^2
sage: hjp41 = hj41.laurent_series().laurent_polynomial()
sage: L = hjp41.parent()
sage: hjp41 == L(j41)
True

```

As soon as we have Puiseux polynomials available, an option to use it would be a nice enhancement here, too.

Frederic, I still think that the line of code I posted in my previous comment (from June 2020) should be removed. After removing it the cross check against all of KnotInfo's Conway polynomials passes.

```
sage: B = BraidGroup(3)
....: L = Link(B([1, -2, 1, -2]))
....: L.conway_polynomial()
-t^2 + 1
sage: R = _.parent()
sage: kicps = {k:R(k[k.items.conway_polynomial].replace('z', 't')) for k in KnotInfo}
sage: len(kicps)
7166
sage: %time all(k.link().conway_polynomial() == kicps[k] for k in KnotInfo)
CPU times: user 6min 25s, sys: 270 ms, total: 6min 26s
Wall time: 6min 26s
True
```

I push a corresponding fix and in addition add some doctests. If you agree with it you may give it a positive review.
