I just installed pcre on my Mac with `./configure; make; make install`, and I get a doctest failure with `stats/r.py`. If I instead emulate the installation of the Sage `pcre` package and use `./configure --enable-utf --enable-unicode-properties --enable-jit` followed by `make; make install`, everything works. Should the `.m4` file test for the appropriate feature of the system's `pcre` rather than just the presence of the library?

The doctest failure:

Do you mean to say that in 2019 the newest MacOS ships a library without UTF support? Indeed, it seems they do, according to https://opensource.apple.com/source/pcre/pcre-9/Makefile.auto.html

(There is no pcre in Xcode on my OSX 10.13 for some reason) 

Thanks Apple, you are the torch of progress... :-)

Well yes, sure, we can add a test for this.

Care to submit a bug report to Apple, as it's really silly of them...

a typical installation of `pcre(2)` comes with `pcretest` and/or `pcre2test`. Does MacOS have them? 

If so, what's the output of `pcretest -C` and `pcre2test -C` ?

Also, what is the output of `pkg-config --modversion libpcre` ? (if any)

No, I mean to say that I downloaded a tarball for pcre and ran `./configure; make; make install`, expecting that the default settings for `./configure` would be sensible, but instead they lead to the doctest failure I mentioned.

> Indeed, it seems they do, according to https://opensource.apple.com/source/pcre/pcre-9/Makefile.auto.html

I wasn't using this.
