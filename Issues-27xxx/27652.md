I have two reasons:

1.) the result of plethysm with a tensor is a tensor.

2.) I have a class that inherits from `CombinatorialFreeModule_Tensor`.  Essentially, it is a parent for tensor products of symmetric functions, with some extra methods.  I want that plethysm with an element from this class works.  It almost does, except that the result is then a tensor product, and not an element from my class.

To elaborate on 2., here is my code.  (The `tensor_constructor` method works around another thing, which I think is a bug.)

This change is not consistent with other uses of plethysm.  I don't think that your "1.) the result of plethysm with a tensor is a tensor" is a reason at all because the plethysm of a tensor is already a tensor.  What you are doing is proposing changing the output basis.

But then you should cast the output into your class.

OK, no problem, although I do not understand your reasons.

Possibly I miscommunicated item 1: what I meant to say is that `f(g)` is more naturally an element of the parent of `g` than of the parent of `f`.  The basis `f` is expressed in cannot possibly be a basis for `g` or `f(g)`, except when `f` and `g` are both symmetric functions (in a single alphabet, so to say).

In other words, the change of basis `plethysm` currently does is much more drastic than what I am proposing.

I agree that item 2 is not a good reason.  However, I do not know an easy workaround.  In particular, I do not know how to cast the output into my class, because `plethysm` is a method of symmetric functions, not of my class.

Maybe sometimes, but not in my uses of plethysm.  I might be able to be convinced, but I would examples and even then I would hesitate to make a change like this because that is not what happens for `f(g)` currently and it is likely to break users' code.

> In particular, I do not know how to cast the output into my class, because plethysm is a method of symmetric functions, not of my class.

I think that what you are proposing is a way to `f(g)` when `g` is not a symmetric function or a tensor of symmetric functions, but instead an element of your new class.  That is, you are proposing adding another case into the computation of `f(g)` : if `g` is of new class then do yet a different computation.  I don't think that this requires you to change the default behavior of the computation of `f(g)` when `g` is a tensor of symmetric functions.

I agree that other conventions may be more convenient for other uses.  Of course, I know nothing about your uses of plethysm.

In my computations, it happens frequently that the basis of the tensor product is chosen for a reason, and the basis of `f`  in `f(g)` is rather arbitrary.  But this is very likely only by coincidence.

```
sage: s[2](tensor([s(h[2]), s(m[2])]))
s[2, 2] # s[2, 2] - s[2, 2] # s[3, 1] + s[2, 2] # s[4] + s[3, 1] # s[1, 1, 1, 1] - s[3, 1] # s[2, 1, 1] + s[3, 1] # s[2, 2] + s[4] # s[2, 2] - s[4] # s[3, 1] + s[4] # s[4]
sage: s[2](tensor([(h[2]), (m[2])]))
h[2, 2] # m[2, 2] + h[2, 2] # m[4] - h[3, 1] # m[4] + h[4] # m[4]
```

I guess that the only real reason I have to offer is that a basis for the symmetric functions cannot possibly be a basis for a tensor power of symmetric functions.  Since the result is in tensor space, I really have to choose a basis for the tensor space, and taking a power of the basis of `f` seems more arbitrary than taking the basis of `g`.

Concerning the other question: no I do not want to add another case into the computation of `f(g)`, my class for `g` is simply a tensor product of symmetric functions with some more methods.  I guess it might be possible to define an action of symmetric functions on my class, but I don't know how to do that.  I wonder how generic plethysm really is (I think Borger and Wieland studied that).

Hi Martin, Can you explain your example?  Why would one prefer that the basis of `f(g)` should be expressed in the expression of `g` rather than the basis of `f`?

A typical use for plethysm in symmetric functions would be to represent expressions like $s_\lambda[X+1]$ or $s_\lambda[(1-q)X]$ in which case you would want those expressions to be expanded in the Schur basis and not of that where your expression $X+1$ or $(1-q)X$ lies.  For example::

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ['q'].fraction_field()).inject_shorthands(verbose=False)
sage: X = p[1]
sage: q = s.base_ring().gen()
sage: s[3,2](X+1)
s[2] + s[2, 1] + s[2, 2] + s[3] + s[3, 1] + s[3, 2]
sage: s[2,1]((1-q)*X)
(q^2-q)*s[1, 1, 1] + (-q^3+2*q^2-2*q+1)*s[2, 1] + (q^2-q)*s[3]
```

I would agree that a case *could* be made that the parent should be chosen from the inner symmetric function rather than the outer.  The problem is that a lot of code is based on the opposite choice was made from the very beginning.

Hi Mike!

Thank you for your rapid answer!

My example only shows that plethysm of `SymmetricFunctions` and `LazySymmetricFunctions` behaves differently.

I just realised that this behaviour (using the outer parent) is actually very specific to symmetric functions:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: Q.<t> = QQ[]
sage: f = 1 + t + 2*t^2
sage: f(s[1] + s[2] + s[1,1])
s[] + s[1] + 3*s[1, 1] + 4*s[1, 1, 1] + 2*s[1, 1, 1, 1] + 3*s[2] + 8*s[2, 1] + 6*s[2, 1, 1] + 4*s[2, 2] + 4*s[3] + 6*s[3, 1] + 2*s[4]
```
Thus, polynomials of symmetric functions yield symmetric functions.

Wow, great, thank you!

Apparently I misremembered, because there we only compute a single degree of the plethysm, not all of them.

However, `%prun` shows something very strange, which might give us a hint for what we are doing wrong.

```
sage: N=5; f = sum(s(Partitions(n).random_element()) for n in range(N)); g = sum(s(Partitions(n).random_element()) for n in range(1, N)); f1 = L(f) + L(lambda n: 0) ; g1 = L(g) + L(lambda n: 0)

sage: %prun r1 = f1(g1).truncate(f.degree()*g.degree()+1)

For some reason, `t_POWSYM_SCHUR_symmetrica` is called more than twice as often for our algorithm than for the one in `sfa.py`.  I don't see why this should be the case.  Same goes for `stretch`.

Indeed, that is interesting. I guess it depends on what things we want to actually compute.

Perhaps we can move this to a new ticket, both to keep the scope of this ticket to symmetric functions, and to not spam other cc-ed people. `;)`.

For this ticket, I rebased it on #34470 (strictly speaking, it should be #34413) as there was a conflict. I made an optimization with how the sums are computed. I also fixed a few things with how scalars are handled, which arose from making the output be in the input parent (or the base ring for scalars; I don't see an easy way to deal with doing pushouts).

Unfortunately I accidentally put my changes into the merge comment. `>_<` So it is hard to see the bulk of them commit-by-commit.

Anyways, if the patchbot comes back again green and you are happy with my changes, then I think we are at a positive review.

Should there be a doctest (and perhaps even specification) demonstrating that the parent is now the parent of the inner function?

Should there maybe even be a warning?  I am somewhat afraid that some people may have private code like

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: p = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).p()
sage: n = 5; f = p[2,2,1] + p[5]
sage: s[2](f)[Partition([2*n])]
3
```
who might be not amused about not being warned.
