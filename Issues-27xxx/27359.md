#27196 modified a test for `sage_makedirs` to try to make a directory in place of the actual Python executable (`sys.executable`).

This test has a number of problems, not the least of which being that it will fail for permission reasons when run in a distro like Python.

But it actually breaks Sage on Windows because it *succeeds* in creating a directory called "python2" alongside the actual executable "python2.exe".

I think the test itself is a bit silly since it's just testing standard functionality of the stdlib's `os.makedirs`, but if we want to keep it for example purposes I would rewrite it to actually use a temp file and not try to overwrite a real file used by the system.

Not really, as `os.makedirs` fails if the directory already exists. (In Python 3, this was improved by adding support for an `exist_ok=True` flag)
