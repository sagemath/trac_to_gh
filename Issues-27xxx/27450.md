Why does this remove

```diff
-def len3d(v):
-    """
-    Return the norm of a vector in three dimensions.
-
-    EXAMPLES::
-
-        sage: from sage.plot.plot3d.index_face_set import len3d
-        sage: len3d((1,2,3))
-        3.7416573867739413
-    """
-    return sqrt(v[0] * v[0] + v[1] * v[1] + v[2] * v[2])
-
-
```

Even if it isn't used anywhere, and probably doesn't belong there (which I agree), it's still a documented, public function, and has to go through a deprecation process.  An unfortunate fact of overdocumenting and underuse of private underscored functions.
