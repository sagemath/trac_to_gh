Why does this remove

```diff
-def len3d(v):

Even if it isn't used anywhere, and probably doesn't belong there (which I agree), it's still a documented, public function, and has to go through a deprecation process.  An unfortunate fact of overdocumenting and underuse of private underscored functions.
