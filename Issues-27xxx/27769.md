```
Under rare conditions, sage is killed at startup by sage-cleaner.

This requires:

1. Files left over in  ~/.sage/temp/HOSTNAME/PID
2. A pid in ~/.sage/temp/HOSTNAME/PID/spawned_processes must exist, and be started at init time. Its process group id will be 0

When sage-cleaner tries to clean up, it will do a "kill 0", which will kill sage.

Files will only be left in ~/.sage/temp/HOSTNAME if sage is not shutdown properly. Most likely because of a reboot.

The attached patch to sage-cleaner prevents it from doing 'kill 0'

With the fix, the ~/.sage/temp/HOSTNAME/cleaner.log 

```

Its not actually the PID, but the process group id PGID.

sage-cleaner is getting a pid out of a stale spawned_processes file, and retrieving the process group id for that. It just so happens that the pid 814 is owned by root, and its process group id is 0.

```
ps axo pid,pgrp,user,ppid,comm -q 814
  PID  PGRP USER      PPID COMMAND
  814     0 root         2 loop11
```

sage-cleaner is calling getpgid():

```
>>> import os
>>> print(os.getpgid(814))
0
```

This confluence of events is almost as rare as unicorns. My motivation in posting it was that it took a long time for me to figure out what was wrong. I wanted to save others the trouble.

One could argue that the root cause is the failure of sage-cleaner to remove everything under ~/.sage/temp/HOSTNAME/ at startup.

Would that be a better solution?

Sorry. Hopefully I have done it correctly now. After jdemeyer's comment, I changed my approach. The attachment is not needed. Checked in changes via git trac push.
