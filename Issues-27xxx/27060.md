In order to debug crashes with cypari2 (#26442), I added some checks to cypari2. But these checks are now failing because `sig_on()` is regularly used badly inside Sage.

As documented in the cysignals documentation, code inside a `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` block should not manipulate Python objects. The reason is that an interrupt at that time could put Python objects in an invalid state. It is especially problematic if a garbage collection happens inside a `sig_on()` block (because that takes a non-trivial amount of time and has a high probability of putting things in an invalid state).

This ticket fixes a few of those cases where garbage collection might happen.
