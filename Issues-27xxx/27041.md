No, we are both wrong :-) 

#22805 is from Sage 8.0

#22698, #23855, #24105 are from Sage 8.1

So this should be fine.

Maybe not for this ticket, but there's a patch in Debian related to this that I think would be worth incorporating into Sage somehow:

```diff
Description: Additional changes to work with the Debian package of singular
 We search for a specific SOVERSION of libsingular-Singular, to allow us to
 runtime-Depend on libsingular4 and not libsingular4-dev.
Author: Tobias Hansen <thansen@debian.org>

I think that this demonstrates that there needs to be a better way to customize where sage looks for bits of Singular (the library, as well as its docs and include files).
