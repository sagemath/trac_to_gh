With Maple installed, and with this ticket, we get:

```
sage: m = vector([1, x, 2, 3])
sage: mm = maple(m)
sage: mm
Vector[row](4, [1,x,2,3])
sage: mm.sage()
(1, x, 2, 3)
sage: mm.sage() == m
True
```

Compare to the situation with Maple installed, before this ticket:

```
sage: m = vector([1, x, 2, 3])
sage: mm = maple(m)
sage: mm
Vector[row](4, [1,x,2,3])
sage: mm.sage()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: Unable to parse Maple output: Vector[row](4, [1,x,2,3])
```
