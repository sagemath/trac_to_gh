Problem is due to


```
sage: G = Graph([(1,2),(2,3),(2,3),(3,4),(1,4),(1,4),(4,5),(5,6),(4,6),(6,7)],multiedges=True)

sage: w=G.subgraph(edges=[(1,4,None)])
sage: w
Subgraph of (): Multi-graph on 7 vertices
sage: w.edges()
[(1, 4, None), (1, 4, None)]

```

Subgraph is returning with multiple edges instead it should have an edge 1 time(maybe).

Also I am not sure of the definition should the answer for this graph be 

```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1]]
```

OR

```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1],[1,4],[2,3]]
```

Graphs should be simple and unweighted :P

Concerning `.subgraph`, the result you get is what is documented

```
        - ``vertices`` -- a single vertex or an iterable container of vertices,
          e.g. a list, set, graph, file or numeric array. If not passed (i.e.,
          ``None``), defaults to the entire graph.

        - ``edges`` -- as with ``vertices``, edges can be a single edge or an
          iterable container of edges (e.g., a list, set, file, numeric array,
          etc.). By default (``edges=None``), all edges are assumed and the
          returned graph is an induced subgraph. In the case of multiple edges,
          specifying an edge as `(u,v)` means to keep all edges `(u,v)`,
          regardless of the label.
```

There is a mistake in the documentation. It is documented that `output` can be `'vertex'` or `'edges'`, but

```
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edges')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

ValueError: output must be either vertex or edge
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edge')
[[(1, 4, None), (4, 1, None)], [(1, 4, None), (4, 1, None)]]
```

I don't know how to fix the issue.

Replying to [@dcoudert](#comment%3A3):

but in the examples of cycle_basis following is given:
here G is non simple 

```
For undirected graphs with multiple edges:

sage: G = Graph([(0, 2, 'a'), (0, 2, 'b'), (0, 1, 'c'), (1, 2, 'd')], multiedges=True)
sage: G.cycle_basis()
[[0, 2], [2, 1, 0]]
sage: G.cycle_basis(output='edge')
[[(0, 2, 'a'), (2, 0, 'b')], [(2, 1, 'd'), (1, 0, 'c'), (0, 2, 'a')]]

```
return [self.subgraph(edges=T + [e]).is_forest(certificate=True,

we use

Since self.subgraph(e) includes multiple existing copies of e as mentioned above in comment and, if two copies of e = (x,y) are in graph and suppose e got included in T, then there is a cycle including (x,y) always in subgraph(T+[e]), which is returned.
So, to avoid that we should use the above method.
But it will require extra overhead of creating Graph multiple times, maybe we can use this method only when G has parameter multiedges=True.

I think the answer should be 

```
[[5, 6, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1],[1,4],[2,3]]
```

according to definition of cycle_basis.

<div id="comment:28" align="right">Comment 28</div>

A few improvements:

- Note that Networkx implementation of cycle_basis also does not work for directed graphs so we can check that at the start of the code and return the appropriate error there only.

- A small grammatical error ;)

```diff
-        a dictionary associating an unique vector to each undirected edge::
+        a dictionary associating a unique vector to each undirected edge::
```

- Since the copy parameter of Networkx graph has been deprecated(ticket:27491) you may remove it:

```diff
-        cycle_basis_v = networkx.cycle_basis(self.networkx_graph(copy=False))
+        cycle_basis_v = networkx.cycle_basis(self.networkx_graph())
```
