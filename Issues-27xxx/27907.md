On various Linux systemswith old compilers, building gcc 7.2.0 fails because crti.o is not found.

Reported for Red Hat 6.10 at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ze5SzgXZAgk/tai9F4flBQAJ

Also occurs on a different system: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core): There is only `/lib64/crti.o` (same as `/usr/lib64/crti.o`) and the gcc build does not find it and fails as well. 
Fix for this system: 

```
export LIBRARY_PATH="/lib64"
```
before building sage.

On the CentOS system mentioned in the ticket's description, the system's gcc is actually configured correctly: `gcc -print-search-dirs` has a long list of paths that includes `/lib64` (= `/usr/lib64` on this system).

The folks at Linuxbrew do the following in https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew-core/blob/master/Formula/gcc`@`7.rb:

```
        # Set the search path for glibc libraries and objects, using the system's glibc
        # Fix the error: ld: cannot find crti.o: No such file or directory
        ENV.prepend_path "LIBRARY_PATH", Pathname.new(Utils.popen_read(ENV.cc, "-print-file-name=crti.o")).parent
```
On the CentOS system I can confirm that `gcc -print-file-name=crti.o` gives the correct file name. 
So this may be a sound approach.

Unfortunately, your fix does not yet solve it for me:

```

>  if [ -n "$CRTI_DIR" -a "$CRTI_DIR" != "." ]; then
>  export LIBRARY_PATH="$LIBRARY_PATH:$CRTI_DIR"
>  fi
> fi
[stumpcl2@dlp762 sage]$ echo $CRTI_DIR
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../lib64
[stumpcl2@dlp762 sage]$ echo $LIBRARY_PATH
/lib64:/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../lib64
```
while building from scratch yields the error

```
[gcc-7.2.0] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../lib64/../lib/crti.o: could not read symbols: File in wrong format
```
So it leaves `lib64` again and goes back to `lib` to look for `crti.o`.

Possible solution, again from Linuxbrew:

```
      gcc = bin/"gcc-7"
      libgcc = Pathname.new(Utils.popen_read(gcc, "-print-libgcc-file-name")).parent
      raise "command failed: #{gcc} -print-libgcc-file-name" if $CHILD_STATUS.exitstatus.nonzero?

      glibc = Formula["glibc"]
      glibc_installed = glibc.any_version_installed?

      # Symlink crt1.o and friends where gcc can find it.
      if glibc_installed
        crtdir = glibc.opt_lib
      else
        crtdir = Pathname.new(Utils.popen_read("/usr/bin/cc", "-print-file-name=crti.o")).parent
      end
      ln_sf Dir[crtdir/"*crt?.o"], libgcc

```

Took me a while to find my way through this little maze of scripts.
Seems to work now, the crt symlinks are now removed by the postrm script. Please take a look. 

I notice that after `make gcc-clean`, an empty chain of directories `gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/7.2.0/plugin/include/ada` remains under `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.
I think it's unrelated to this ticket.

<a id='comment:47'></a>I'm confused.  What you used to have as `spkg-postinst` you *renamed* to `spkg-postrm`, which is not what I intended.

It also now reads:

```
-spkg-postinst
\ No newline at end of file
+# -*- mode: shell-script -*-
+
+# Force re-installation of gmp, mpir, mpfr and mpc with the GCC that we

+# built without C++ support.
```

This script is run *after* you *uninstall* a package, so the comment about "the GCC that we just built" can't be accurate (it was accurate for when this was a `postinst` script.

I will have to take more time to actually understand what you're trying to do here.  As it is I believe we are spending too much technical debt on trying to maintain gcc builds for old platforms...

Has `CRTI_DIR` been set correctly in `src/bin/sage-env-config` on this system?

Before this ticket, `spkg-postrm` was a symlink to `spkg-postinst`. 
In both `spkg-postrm` and `spkg-postinst`, the same actions (trigger uninstalls, reconfigure) are taken.

I added additional things to the front of `spkg-postinst`.

(The diff does not show this very well.)

I have updated the explanation in `spkg-postrm`.
(Actually, in the `spkg-postrm` situation, I don't know why `--keep-files` would be used; but it's beyond the scope of this ticket to change it.)

<a id='comment:56'></a>Got it--this is starting to make sense to me now.  The part where you actually *modify* the the postrm script on the fly is interesting: That was not an explicitly supported use case, so it makes me a little nervous (since it means now we *do* have to support that), but if it works it works.

If for some reason we need to change things such that it would not be easy to support this usage, I believe a different solution could be found.
