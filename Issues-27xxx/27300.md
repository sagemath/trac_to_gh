The file `spkg-install` for the pip package says

```
# Install pip3 first so pip2 overwrites local/bin/pip
for vers in 3 2; do
    python${vers} -m pip install --verbose --no-index --ignore-installed \
            --no-build-isolation --isolated --root="$SAGE_DESTDIR" . || \
        sdh_die "Error building / installing pip${vers}"
done
```
But really the order should depend on whether `SAGE_PYTHON3` is "YES", because then the Python 3 version should overwrite the Python 2 version. The current situation causes a doctest failure in `misc/package.py`, in particular in the function `pip_installed_packages`.
