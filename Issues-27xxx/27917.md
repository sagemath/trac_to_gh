It has recently come to my attention that there are a few doctest strings within Sage that do not follow the standard (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings). Please see the comments in #5548 for the details/conversation, but essentially, all doctests should be preceded by either a `TESTS::` or `EXAMPLES::` header.

I have found a few places where this is not done:
* set_calculus_method() of src/sage/manifolds/manifold.py
* from_tamari_sorting_tuple() of src/sage/combinat/binary_tree.py ("EXEMPLES" instead of "EXAMPLES")
* init() of GenericGraphQuery? in src/sage/graphs/graph_database.py 
* _hnf_mod() of src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx

There are also a few places where we have `Examples::` or `Tests::` instead of `EXAMPLES::` or `TESTS::`, and other places have `EXAMPLES:` (only one colon)... I am not sure if this matters for running doctests but for consistency, they should be fixed too.

* preimage() and dual() of src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_subscheme.py
* _richcmp_() of src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_point.py
* Lattes_map() of src/sage/schemes/projective/projective_space.py
* _call_(), SchemeMorphism_polynomial, __getitem__(), __mul__(), glue_along_domains() of src/sage/schemes/generic/morphism.py

I have undoubtedly missed many other mistakes, so I believe this ticket is two-fold - we should first compile a list of files with incorrect docstring headers, and then fix them.

In more detail: if the following line is not indented, a single colon is correct, like this:

```
EXAMPLES:

Here is some explanatory text. ::

    sage: 2+2
    5
```
Using `EXAMPLES::` would produce an error.
