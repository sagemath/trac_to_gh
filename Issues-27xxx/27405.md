When querying installed packages using `pip`, sage will currently parse stdout and not explicitly handle stderr. That means that stderr will be printed to the terminal.

Since pip 19 has started printing a deprecation warning for python 2.7, this warning will also be printed when querying installed packages with sage. That leads to doctest failures.

Since this warning does not belong to the `installed_packages` function (using pip is an implementation detail here) and to make sure the doctests work for old as well as new pip versions (and python2 as well as python3), we should explicitly send stderr to /dev/null.

The alternative would be to incorporate the deprecation warning into the doctest. That would make it harder to use the system pip (which I don't think we currently do but probably will want to do in the future).
