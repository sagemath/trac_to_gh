You check that paths don't start with `\\`. Shouldn't you also check that it's not `/` ?

An alternative could be to build absolute paths (using `os.path.abspath`) and to check that each absolute path starts with the absolute path of extraction directory.

I think that this issue should be fixed in Python's `tarfile` module. Given that it's known since 2014, there is no way that this is a blocker. After reading the upstream issue, it's clear that there are many more potential problems than just paths starting with `/` or containing `..`. So this patch doesn't really fix the security hole.
