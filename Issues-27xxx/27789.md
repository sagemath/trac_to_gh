<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Checked the built documentation and tested, here are my comments:

* There are some lambda functions early on that don't have the semicolon in the right spot.

* In "For this, take a Map function that associates..." - why is "Map" capitalized?

* I think most conventions for sigma notation leave out the "i=" in the superscript. Only comes up in one changed line, but appears a few other places.

* The "x-factorial" isn't standard terminology, it's always "q-factorial". I'd suggest either changing the variable to `q`, or saying that this is the q-factorial (in the variable `x`). You can even link to `sage.combinat.q_analogues.q_factorial`.

* The associated test also fails. Since `x` is previously defined as the generator of a polynomial ring, Sage will take an expression like `(1-x^i)/(1-x)` and create it in an associated fraction field. Here, the method you would use is `reduce()`. Except this is a method that just updates the internal representation of the fraction field element and won't return anything, so you'd need to do

  `sage: A = (prod((1-x**i)/(1-x) for i in range(1, 6))).reduce(); A`

  The alternative is to do something to clear `x` and have it return to being a formal parameter, and then `(1-x^i)/(1-x)` will be treated as a more generic rational expression where `simplify_rational()` will work.

* Broken doclinks: `profile.profile`, `sage.parallel.map_reduce.logger`, a bunch of things that look similar to <code>:meth:\`master._shutdown\`</code>

* I don't think "Active Tasks" should be capitalized in the `ActiveTaskCounterDarwin` class docstring.

* The last part of this line

  <code>during normal usage. Most of the time one should leave it to \`\`True\`\`,</code>

  I think should be <code>leave it as \`\`True\`\`</code>, or a little more awkwardly, <code>leave it set to \`\`True''</code>.

* Pretty sure that unpaired right parenthesis should be a comma in

  <code>During normal time, that is when all workers are active) a worker \`\`W\`\` is</code>

* `post_process` and `map_function` should have their input as single element list (or something matching the rest of the conventions chosen).

* `random_worker` docstring has a period at the end.
