As discussed in other tickets, such as #27373 and #26899, it would sometimes be useful to be able to explicitly specify, at configure-time, whether or not a system package can be used to fulfill some SPKG dependency.

With the work being done for #27330, it is currently the case that if an SPKG has a `spkg-configure.m4`, and the checks performed for the system package succeed, then the system package will always be used whether you want to or not.

This is a problem because even of the configure-time checks succeed, there could be previously unknown or unanticipated problems with using a particular version of the system package or some package+platform combination.

Therefore it is useful (if unfortunate) to be able to force use of the SPKG and disable checking for the system package.  In principle we would want to react to the broken package+platform combination as well, either by fixing it somehow or blacklisting that particular combination at configure-time.  However, by providing this option, we at least don't have to react immediately to such problems if/when they arise (e.g. #26899).

This ticket adds a `--with-system-<spkg>` flag to `configure`; e.g. `--with-system-zlib`.  By default this is enabled (the current behavior), but by passing `--with-system-zlib=no` or `--without-system-zlib` then the SPKG will be installed without checking the system for the dependency.

This also adds the option to pass `--with-system-zlib=force` meaning that if the dependency cannot be found on the system then configure will abort with an error message.

This would effectively replace #21538.

This would provide at least a partial workaround to #26899.  Knowing (as we do now) that using the system zlib is problematic on some OSX's (in this case due to a bug in *python*). With this feature we can at least tell users to run `make configure; ./configure --without-system-zlib` as a workaround.

I think this *might* also be useful for resolving #27373, though I don't believe it's strictly necessary for that either.

I'm certainly open to revisions on the concept, but I do believe that such a flag, however it's named, is useful.

We might need to modify some other macros (e.g. `AX_CHECK_ZLIB`) which already provides a `--with-zlib` option.
