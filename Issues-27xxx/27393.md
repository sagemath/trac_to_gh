If the `gap_packages` optional package is installed, there is some code enabled in `sage.coding.linear_code` which uses the Guava package.  However, some of the tests that use it fail on Cygwin with:

```

The "exit status -11" indicates a segmentation fault in the `wtdist` program, whatever that is.

Since `gap_packages` is an optional package not installed by default I don't think this is urgent, but it would be good to find out what's going on.

Originally reported in #26930.
