Currently, there is a base class `CoercionModel` defined in `element.pyx` and the real coercion model is a derived class `CoercionModel_cache_maps` in `coerce.pyx`. This is explained by a comment in `element.pyx`:

```
# We define this base class here to avoid circular cimports.
```

However, we can get rid of this circular import by forcing `element` to be imported first.

Then we can move the coercion model to `coerce.pyx`. This has the following advantages:

1. simpler code as the superfluous base class can be deleted.

2. making more sense as everything regarding the coercion model will be in `coerce.pyx`

3. better performance for Cython code that `cimport`s the coercion model as it now has access to al `cdef` methods and attributes, not only those from the old `CoercionModel` base class.
