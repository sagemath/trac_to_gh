This is a subticket for #27873. Main things done in this ticket are:

- Base classes for integral curves over finite fields are added.

- The constructor of curves is refactored to support integral curves.

- Curves over **prime** finite fields are removed (become curves over finite fields).

- Integral curves are equipped with function fields.

<a id='comment:22'>Comment 22:</a>
I have a few comments.

This can be simplified:

```diff
-            points = []
-            for x in K:
-                for y in K:
-                    if f(x,y) == 0:
-                        points.append(self((x,y)))
-            points.sort()
-            return points
+            return sorted((self((x,y)) for x in K for y in K if f(x,y) == 0))
```
which should be faster too.

In `_nonsingular_model`, the `TESTS::` block needs to be indented.

The line `super(IntegralAffineCurve, self)._element_constructor_(x)` is missing the `return`.

```diff
-s = set([p for f in self._coordinate_functions if f for p in f.poles()])
+s = set(p for f in self._coordinate_functions if f for p in f.poles())
```
(although you can just as easily combine it with the line after it.

Typically we do:

```
-        OUTPUT: a list of polynomials in the coordinate ring of the ambient
-        space of the curve this point is on.
+        OUTPUT:
+
+        a list of polynomials in the coordinate ring of the ambient
+        space of the curve this point is on
```
since it is a longer description.

Be careful when changing input parameter names, e.g.,{

```diff
-def affine_patch(self, i, AA=None):
+def affine_patch(self, i, A=None):
```
as this is a backwards incompatible change. I would either recommend not doing it or adding a deprecation (I think there is a decorator that does this, but I don't remember what it is offhand). However, this is likely not passed as `foo.affine_patch(i, AA=bar)`, so it might not matter so much. In the `ProjectiveSpace_ring.__clascall__`, I would say that is a much more necessary change and should just be done outright.

Done. Thanks.

Done.

> The line `super(IntegralAffineCurve, self)._element_constructor_(x)` is missing the `return`.

This revealed that the method `_element_constructor_` itself is not needed here. Removed.

Done.

Done. And I also touched a few other docstrings as I can spot.

However, this is likely not passed as `foo.affine_patch(i, AA=bar)`, so it might not matter so much. In the `ProjectiveSpace_ring.__clascall__`, I would say that is a much more necessary change and should just be done outright.

I recovered it, as I realized it means "ambient affine", so double A is appropriate.

`X in Fields` also works.  But as far as I know, `X in Fields()` is the documented style and more importantly

```
sage: from sage.categories.fields import Fields  
sage: time QQ in Fields
CPU times: user 34 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 34 µs
Wall time: 37.2 µs
True
sage: time QQ in Fields()
CPU times: user 13 µs, sys: 1 µs, total: 14 µs
Wall time: 16.2 µs
True
sage: type(Fields)
<class 'sage.misc.classcall_metaclass.ClasscallMetaclass'>
sage: type(Fields())
<class 'sage.categories.fields.Fields_with_category'>
```
I would like the syntax `X in Fields` but now I got used to `X in Fields()`.
