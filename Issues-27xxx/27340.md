Instructions for git-trac-command in the Developer's Guide needs to be updated to match the instructions and new options listed on the Readme of the git-trac-command GitHub page.

In particular, the Developer's Guide makes no mention of the new --token= option, which is the only way that people with GitHub accounts are able to authenticate.
