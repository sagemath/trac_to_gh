On all of the following examples, the warning 

```
Warning: falling back to very slow toy implementation.
```
appear:

```
            sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 0)
            sage: P.ideal([P(2)]).groebner_basis()
            [1]

            sage: P.ideal([3,4,0,5]).groebner_basis()
            [1]
```
Handle these cases separately! (Reason: singular does not handle these cases.)

A test would always result in

```
TypeError: Can only reduce polynomials over fields.
```
also with this patch. Is this what you mean? (The situation for non-fields is more complex as coefficients do not need to divide each other...)

I believe that in general, but over `ZZ` Singular does GB computations:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: R.ideal([x^2-y,x*y-z*y+2,5*x*z-x]).groebner_basis()
[y*z^2 - y^2 - 2*x - 2*z, x^2 - y, x*y - y*z + 2, 5*y^2 - y*z + 10*x + 2, 5*x*z - x, 5*y*z - y, 10*z - 2]
sage: R.ideal([5,2]).groebner_basis()
[1]
```
So since singular works for `ZZ`, I think this patch should also fix it at least for that ring.
