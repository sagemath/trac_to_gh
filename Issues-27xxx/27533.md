The method `Polyhedron.is_simple` is pretty slow for large polytopes at the moment. There is no need for that, as the information can be directly retrieved from the `Vrepresentation`.

Current timings:

```
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(6)
sage: %time P.is_simple()
CPU times: user 360 ms, sys: 8 ms, total: 368 ms
Wall time: 364 ms
True
sage: P = polytopes.hypercube(7)
sage: %time P.is_simple()
CPU times: user 1.78 s, sys: 48 ms, total: 1.83 s
Wall time: 1.74 s

sage: P = polytopes.cross_polytope(7)
sage: %time P.is_simple()
CPU times: user 996 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 996 ms
