Is this a correct alignment or should the 3rd line be slightly shifted ?

```diff
+                        S = [x for x in self.neighbors_out(linext[k - 1])
+                             if x not in linext and
+                             all(low in linext for low in self.neighbors_in(x))]
```



I don't find this change improving the readability, but if it's the correct pep8 form, then OK.

```diff
-        return (self.num_edges()+1 == self.num_verts() and # Hasse Diagram is a tree
-                all(d<=1 for d in self.out_degree())   and # max outdegree is <= 1
-                all(d<=1 for d in self.in_degree()))       # max  indegree is <= 1
+        return (self.num_edges() + 1 == self.num_verts() and
+                # Hasse Diagram is a tree
+                all(d <= 1 for d in self.out_degree()) and
+                # max outdegree is <= 1
+                all(d <= 1 for d in self.in_degree()))  # max  indegree is <= 1
```

otherwise, looks good to me.
