This should be inherited by default so that it behaves properly.

Before this ticket:

```
sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['A',[1,1]], [2,1])
sage: S = T.subcrystal(max_depth=3)
sage: S.category()
Category of finite crystals
```

After this ticket:

```
sage: T = crystals.Tableaux(['A',[1,1]], [2,1])
sage: S = T.subcrystal(max_depth=3)
sage: S.category()
Category of regular super crystals
```
