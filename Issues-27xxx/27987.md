`CombinatorialPolyhedron` as of #26887 only requires the number of lines (as `n_lines` in `Polyhedron_base`). This does not suffice, as

```
sage: P1 = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,1],[1,0]], rays=[[1,1]])
sage: P2 = Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])
sage: P1.incidence_matrix() == P2.incidence_matrix()
True
```

Instead of just specifying the `n_lines`, one should specify `unbounded` and a far face.

Unfortunately, determining the rays from just the incidence matrix does not seem to work.

Now with the far face at hand anyway, it's much easier to determine the (combinatorial) vertices.

I do not know, where I could possible have made a mistake with catching an interrupt. I suspect that it just sometimes fails at some place that I have no impact on.

A few things:

Are you absolutely sure that nobody will (should) be passing the `n_lines` data to the constructor (unless they know what they are doing)? If not, then you should deprecate that (including having it be in its original position).

`#27987` -> `:trac:`12987``

`if unbounded is False:` -> `if not unbounded:` (unless you expect `unbounded` to possibly be something else like `None` that should be treated differently, in which case you should add a comment about that).

`CombinatorialPolyhedron` has not been in the master branch yet. So I figured it is ok. I can throw a warning, when unbounded is an integer, to make sure no one accidentally uses it.

At the moment, I'm forcing the user to use the Vrepresentation as in `Polyhedron` w.r. to the lines in the representation.
Maybe this is to restrictive and I should allow the user to just pass the dimension of the affine space contained in the polyhedron instead (raising the dimension by that number).

Okay, then this is good as it currently is (i.e., you do not need to issue a warning).

That is probably best for another ticket.

So if you make the other two changes I mentioned, then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
