In #26887 we created a new class, that handles the calculations depending only on the combinatorial type more quickly.

The goal of this ticket is to make use of this class throughout `Polyhedron_base`.

Add methods:

- #28621: Add method `combinatorial_polyhedron`,
- #28646: `face_generator`,
- #28982: `hasse_diagram`,
- #29186: `simpliciality`, `simplicity`

Replace the existing computation:

- #28625: `f_vector`,
- #28646 `faces`,
- #28626: `graph`/`vertex_graph`,
- `graph`/`vertex_graph` with incidences instead of Vrepresentation/expose the names=False option
-  #32666: `vertex_adjacency_matrix`
- `vertex_digraph`
- #33008: `facet_adjacency_matrix`,
- #28982 `face_lattice`.

Migrate code to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`:

- #33009: `is_prism`
- `is_combinatorially_isomorphic`
- #29565: `is_neighborly`, `neighborliness`
- #29078: `is_simple`,`is_simplicial`
- #29189: `is_lawrence_polytope`
- `is_self_dual`
- #29189: `is_pyramid`
- #33009: `is_bipyramid`
- `combinatorial_automorphism_group`
- #29188: `vertex_facet_graph`

NOTE: The remaining bulletins are taken care of by exposing the adjacency matrices.

Depends on #28621

Concerning the `.faces()` method. Currently, `.iter_face` only deals with proper faces. ... is that the intended behavior?

From an old list (so maybe some of them are renamed), I also saw the following methods make use of `.face_lattice`, and probably would benefit from the combinatorial polyhedra:

- adjacency_matrix
- facet_adjacency_matrix
- facial_adjacencies
- is_simple
- vertex_adjacency_matrix

It would be nice to make a thorough checking of which methods make use of "old style face lattice" things. It would be bad to not make the whole `Polyhedron` objects not benefit from this new class...

This is simply, because my method of intersecting faces and avoiding double counting has no guarantee to hit the empty face in the unbounded case. So one has to manually add it anyway. I would prefer leaving it like this in `FaceIterator`. But I can see that one wants to add those two extra faces (or only one for the empty polyhedron) when wrapping the class.

Yes, that's my plan. If I actually go through with it and make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` a parent of `Polyhedron_base`, as was proposed in #10777, then `CombinatorialPolyhedron` should do all calculations that depend only on the incidence matrix.

Ok, this is a bunch of things. I realized that at some point it makes sense to create some sort of meta ticket for `CombinatorialPolyhedron`, also I realize that this ticket is more an agenda than anything else.

First of all, we should figure out, whether `Polyhedron` shall inherit from `CombinatorialPolyhedron` as a base class or whether its better to have it as a (lazy) method available.

Having it as a base class was proposed in #10777.

Maybe I should start a discussion on sage-devel to see what (interested) people think.

Putting it at needs review is not the appropriate status. In #22420, change the title of the #27063 ticket to "TASK: XXX", where XXX is the current title. Then, what is written will be sufficient to understand what is going on in this ticket. No need to add every single ticket from here, to #22420.
