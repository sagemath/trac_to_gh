In #26887 we created a new class, that handles the calculations depending only on the combinatorial type more quickly.

The goal of this ticket is to make use of this class throughout `Polyhedron_base`.

Add methods:

- #28621: Add method `combinatorial_polyhedron`,
- #28646: `face_generator`,
- #28982: `hasse_diagram`,
- #29186: `simpliciality`, `simplicity`

Replace the existing computation:

- #28625: `f_vector`,
- #28646 `faces`,
- #28626: `graph`/`vertex_graph`,
- `graph`/`vertex_graph` with incidences instead of Vrepresentation/expose the names=False option
-  #32666: `vertex_adjacency_matrix`
- `vertex_digraph`
- #33008: `facet_adjacency_matrix`,
- #28982 `face_lattice`.

Migrate code to `CombinatorialPolyhedron`:

- #33009: `is_prism`
- `is_combinatorially_isomorphic`
- #29565: `is_neighborly`, `neighborliness`
- #29078: `is_simple`,`is_simplicial`
- #29189: `is_lawrence_polytope`
- `is_self_dual`
- #29189: `is_pyramid`
- #33009: `is_bipyramid`
- `combinatorial_automorphism_group`
- #29188: `vertex_facet_graph`

NOTE: The remaining bulletins are taken care of by exposing the adjacency matrices.

From an old list (so maybe some of them are renamed), I also saw the following methods make use of `.face_lattice`, and probably would benefit from the combinatorial polyhedra:

- adjacency_matrix
- facet_adjacency_matrix
- facial_adjacencies
- is_simple
- vertex_adjacency_matrix

It would be nice to make a thorough checking of which methods make use of "old style face lattice" things. It would be bad to not make the whole `Polyhedron` objects not benefit from this new class...

This is simply, because my method of intersecting faces and avoiding double counting has no guarantee to hit the empty face in the unbounded case. So one has to manually add it anyway. I would prefer leaving it like this in `FaceIterator`. But I can see that one wants to add those two extra faces (or only one for the empty polyhedron) when wrapping the class.

Yes, that's my plan. If I actually go through with it and make `CombinatorialPolyhedron` a parent of `Polyhedron_base`, as was proposed in #10777, then `CombinatorialPolyhedron` should do all calculations that depend only on the incidence matrix.

Otherwise we would eventually end up with docstrings gathering all examples from `Polyhedron`, `LatticePolytope` and `Cone`.\n\n\nI am not 100% sure about this. I believe that the method would stay in `Polyhedron_base` (think about the documentation online too) because one expects to see it there (and one does not directly think about the `CombinatorialPolyhedron` class directly, maybe) and the method would be only a couple of lines long and calling the combinatorial algorithm using `super` with the appropriate parameters.\n\nOn the long run, `CombinatorialPolyhedron` will contain the bulk of codes that strictly makes use of combinatorial data and `Polyhedron_base` things that use the geometry.\n\nFurther, concerning the present ticket, I believe it would make sense to make it a preparation ticket. Then each method would have 1 ticket. This way the changes will be more manageable.\n\nAnother open question: currently how is the relation between a `Polyhedron` object and a `CombinatorialPolyhedron` object? I guess that as of now, since the double description is computed by default, it is worth maybe creating the combinatorial counter part as an attribute and make it accessible via a method say named `.combinatorial_polyhedron`. This might make it easier to then transfer the computations to the combinatorial type.\n\nWhen I create a combinatorial polyhedron from a polyhedron, it seems to keep the polyhedron object. Ideally, it would be nice to be able to go back and forth between them like it is for `LP` and `Polyhedron` (okay, it is not fully bakc and forth but still).\n\n... and it would be nice if the methods of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` have exactly the same names for the same things `H_representation` vs `Hrepr`.",

I am not 100% sure about this. I believe that the method would stay in `Polyhedron_base` (think about the documentation online too) because one expects to see it there (and one does not directly think about the `CombinatorialPolyhedron` class directly, maybe) and the method would be only a couple of lines long and calling the combinatorial algorithm using `super` with the appropriate parameters.

On the long run, `CombinatorialPolyhedron` will contain the bulk of codes that strictly makes use of combinatorial data and `Polyhedron_base` things that use the geometry.

Further, concerning the present ticket, I believe it would make sense to make it a preparation ticket. Then each method would have 1 ticket. This way the changes will be more manageable.

Another open question: currently how is the relation between a `Polyhedron` object and a `CombinatorialPolyhedron` object? I guess that as of now, since the double description is computed by default, it is worth maybe creating the combinatorial counter part as an attribute and make it accessible via a method say named `.combinatorial_polyhedron`. This might make it easier to then transfer the computations to the combinatorial type.

When I create a combinatorial polyhedron from a polyhedron, it seems to keep the polyhedron object. Ideally, it would be nice to be able to go back and forth between them like it is for `LP` and `Polyhedron` (okay, it is not fully bakc and forth but still).

... and it would be nice if the methods of `CombinatorialPolyhedron` have exactly the same names for the same things `H_representation` vs `Hrepr`.

First of all, we should figure out, whether `Polyhedron` shall inherit from `CombinatorialPolyhedron` as a base class or whether its better to have it as a (lazy) method available.

Having it as a base class was proposed in #10777.

Maybe I should start a discussion on sage-devel to see what (interested) people think.

Putting it at needs review is not the appropriate status. In #22420, change the title of the #27063 ticket to "TASK: XXX", where XXX is the current title.
