```
as [proposed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/E4vp20O2FN0/j0LfoSUtBAAJ) by Volker, 
extend the bootstrap script to save/load based on the git head sha1, e.g.:

```
    ./bootstrap -s

saves upstream/configure-<sha1>.tag.gz

    ./bootstrap  -u http://path/to/upstream/

loads http://path/to/upstream/configure-<sha1>.tag.gz
```
`./bootstrap  -u <URL>` loads the tarball  to `upstream/` and checks that the checksum matches, as usual,
so this is basically an extenion of `-D` option.

We also remove `-i` as not needed any more.

<div id="comment:1" align="right">comment:1</div>

Is there any need to keep the numeric version numbers?

How about simply switching from version numbers for configure to sha1 versions?

Then `-i` should be just removed, and `-s` would mean `--save-head`, as in the proposal ?
 
So then the main change would be implementing `--load-head` (perhaps, `--load-from-url` is a better name).

basically, `-u <URL>` triggers uploading the URL to upstream/, 
and it implies `-D`.

if the resulting tarball does not match the present branch, too bad, it will fail
(unless it succeeds to download from the "usual" Sage mirrors)

a package tarball is a package tarball. Is there a special-casing for configure package in patch/buildbot configs? 

I presume mentioning its URL in the ticket description should be equivalent to what we do with the "normal" packages (for this the new `-u` feature doesn't seem to be needed). And release tools can make use of it in some way too.
