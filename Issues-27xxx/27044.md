Thought there was a notion of k-weak excedances that could be implemented as a method on permutations. After further reading, this is only a notion for decorated permutations, which will appear in a future implementation of positroids.

But there is still the minor fix that the method `weak_excedences()` should be `weak_excedances()`, which will be done in the next day as a tutorial.

In fact, wiktionary thinks differently and mathematicians used all sorts of spellings.  More precisely:

* 'exceedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exceedance, Corteel, Sedgewick, ...
* 'excedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/excedance, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation, Stanley
* 'excedence': Williams, Corteel, van Willigenburg, ... 

Although 'exedance' also occurs, I think that this probably is by exitand.

Looks like this issue came up in ( #15454 ), which originally used 'excedences' to match what was in sage, but ultimately went with 'excedances' to match the relevant reference.
