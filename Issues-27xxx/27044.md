As chapoton pointed out in #26628, there is a problem with `sage.repl.display.pretty_print` which makes it difficult to import into other modules: The fact that it imports `IPython` (which can sometimes be slow due to IPython's plugin loading and other issues).

Granted, that module is only for use in the IPython REPL (or notebooks) where "pretty printing" is enabled.  But if one wants reference it for some reason in other Sage code there's a risk of slowing down import of sage unnecessarily in cases where we are not using IPython (e.g. importing Sage in a plain Python interpreter, or running `sage -c`).

As #26628 demonstrated, it would also be nice if classes could somehow provide their own "pretty printer" methods (this is somewhat distinct from plain `__repr__` or other rich representation formats, in that it's a representation that is only used in a REPL interface).
