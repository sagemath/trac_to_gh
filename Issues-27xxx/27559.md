The  `from sys import maxint` in `src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py`
makes cryptominisat optional doctests fail with Python 3.

Changing `maxint` to `maxsize` would probably solve the problem.

Easy ticket, probably suitable for a beginner. One needs to install SageMath
and the optional package cryptominisat, and to run tests including optional
