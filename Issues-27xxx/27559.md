The  `from sys import maxint` in `src/sage/sat/solvers/cryptominisat.py`
makes cryptominisat optional doctests fail with Python 3.

Related reading:

- other maxint tickets: https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~maxint
- Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13795758/what-is-sys-maxint-in-python-3

Changing `maxint` to `maxsize` would probably solve the problem.
