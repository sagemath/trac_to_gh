Yes, and instead made sure that the function that returned topcom's output returned a string, not `bytes`, by using `line = line.decode()`. Then the other functions which use that output can continue to use strings rather than `b'...'` when doing things like `triangulation = line[ line.find('{{')+2 : line.rfind('}}') ]`.
