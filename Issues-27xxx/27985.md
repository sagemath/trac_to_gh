This ticket makes the following work:

```
sage: R.<c> = QQ[]
sage: Pc.<x, y> = ProjectiveSpace(R, 1)
sage: f = DynamicalSystem([xˆ2 + c*yˆ2, yˆ2], domain=Pc)
sage: k = FractionField(f.base_ring())
sage: new_fixed = 2
sage: m = matrix(k, 2, 2, [(new_fixed - 1)/new_fixed, 0, -1/new_fixed, 1])
sage: F = f.conjugate(m)
sage: F.dehomogenize(1).dynatomic_polynomial(2)
```
by making the `dynatomic_polynomial` function coerce to the correct base ring.
