We get errors like libpng not being linked to libgd, and then oops, 
things get broken.

Also, as reported in [#31624 comment:28](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31624#comment:28), on `fedora-34` C++ ABI issues in optional dependencies of `libgd` cause trouble.

Okay, at least as described this is not the problem I'm having.  Upon rebuilding libgd I get the following configuration:

```

I assume we don't care about JPEG?

It really looks like the only thing it's used for.  Apparently there is also some support for unpickling a matrix from such a PNG image.  Weird.

So in my case I have a libgd that *is* compiled with PNG support, and linked against the libpng16 in Sage, at least presumably, and it still fails to load.

If, out of curiosity, I manually comment out all the parts of matrix_mod2_dense.pyx that use libgd, and remove its requirement from the link flags for that module, it imports fine.  So there is definitely *something* about the libgd requirement that is blowing up, but I can't figure out easily what it is for some reason.

I'm trying now with rebuilding libpng (and in turn all its dependents of which there are many) in the off chance that can tell me anything...
