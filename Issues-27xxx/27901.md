We get errors like libpng not being linked to libgd, and then oops, 
things get broken.

Also, as reported in [#31624 comment:28](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31624#comment:28), on `fedora-34` C++ ABI issues in optional dependencies of `libgd` cause trouble.

Still having some very bizarre problems related to loading `matrix_mod2_dense.dll`, and in turn `cyggd-3.dll`.  I can't make heads or tails out of it.  I've tried going back to older versions, even back to 8.7 final (which always worked) I'm still getting the problem.

I even hypothesized whether it was a problem with using some of the system libraries for xz, bz2, or more likely zlib, but even disabling those (and building them in Sage) didn't make the problem go away.

Meanwhile, I have a build of Sage in another directory where I experimented with using the system libgd (#27825) and it works!  No problem.

At the very least that's a point in favor of moving forward on #27825.  But this is still very fishy and I need to get to the bottom of it.  It turns out I will likely need to use WinDBG to have any hope of seeing what's going wrong here.
