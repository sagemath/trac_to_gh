The class `ConvexRationalPolyhedralCone` (`sage/geometry/cone.py`) has an "advanced" constructor parameter `PPL` that can be set to a `ppl.polyhedron.C_Polyhedron`. However, before #23024, this attribute used to be set immutable in the constructor and this is not the case anymore (since pplpy does not support the mutability/immutability flag).

This ticket stands to fix this possibly problematic behavior. Some options:
1. reintroduce mutability/immutability in `pplpy`
2. ~~make a copy of the polyhedron~~ (this definitely should not be done - the reason for this parameter is to avoid any work when PPL representation is already constructed)
3. keep it the way it is but fix the [documentation](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/geometry/cone.py#L1370-L1373)
