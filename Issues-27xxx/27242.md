The order in which solutions are found by the branch and bound algorithm depends on the order in which vertices are visited. Hence, this test sometimes answers 10 and some other times 11, and both answers are correct.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import vertex_separation as VS
sage: G = graphs.MycielskiGraph(5)
sage: vs, seq = VS.vertex_separation_BAB(G, cut_off=11); vs
10 or 11
```
We change it to a robust form

```
sage: VS.vertex_separation_BAB(G, cut_off=11)[0] <= 11
True
```
