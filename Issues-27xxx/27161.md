I have a quick question regarding the milestone. Given that the ticket is accepted now, will it be part of the 8.8 release?

Or should we change the milestone for that? Or is it too late in any case?

NO. 8.8 is finished.

No need to change the milestone. But you can if you want. Keeping 8.8 as milestone does not prevent the ticket to be closed in some 8.9 beta release.
