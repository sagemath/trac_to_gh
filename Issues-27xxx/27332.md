Python3-based Sage prints `Âµs` for `µs`:

```
sage: timeit('factorial(999)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11 Âµs per loop
```
Not so in Python3-based Sage.

```
sage: timeit('factorial(999)')
625 loops, best of 3: 11 µs per loop
```
Observed in Sage 8.6 and 8.7.beta4, on macOS and Ubuntu.

The microsecond string `"\xc2\xb5s"` at lines 46 and 213
of the file `src/sage/misc/sage_timeit.py` needs py3 love.

```
    units = ["s", "ms", "\xc2\xb5s", "ns"]
```

Tried that, no improvement. If not the string, then maybe one of

```
sage.misc.sage_timeit_class.sage_timeit.sage_timeit??
sage.misc.sage_timeit_class.sage_timeit.SageTimeitResult??
```
needs py3 love?
