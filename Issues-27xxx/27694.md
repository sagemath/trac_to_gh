Following #27347, one can use

```
sage: from sage.rings.lazy_laurent_series_ring import LazyLaurentSeriesRing
sage: L = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ, 'z')
sage: x = L.gen()
```

It would be nice to have the syntactic sugar

```
sage: L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
```
work, just as it does for non-lazy:

```
sage: L.<x> = LaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)
```

The Sage preparser actually transforms the `L.<x>` input as follows:

```
sage: preparse('L.<x> = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ)')
"L = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ, names=('x',)); (x,) = L._first_ngens(1)"
```
so methods `gens` and `_first_ngens` are needed for `LazyLaurentSeriesRing`.

Does your proposal include importing `LazyLaurentSeriesRing` at startup time?

I fear that it increases startup time. Perhaps using `lazy_import` is necessary.
