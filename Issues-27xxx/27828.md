In v7.3, the following nested polynomial ring construction returns NotImplementedError:

```
q = 11
n = 4
F = GF(q)
rings = [ [F, F(-1)] ]
for i in range(1,n):
    lastring = rings[i-1]
    S.<x> = PolynomialRing(lastring[0], 'x');
    zetaname = 'z' + str(i); # z0 = -1, z1 = i, etc.
    R = S.quotient( x^2 - lastring[1], zetaname ) # take square root of last generator
    rings.append( [R, R.gen()] )
```
Here, changing n=4 to n=3 or changing q=11 to q=13 (or anything 1 mod 4) works fine.

On the other hand, in Sage v8.3, this now works for q=11 but is now broken (NotImplementedError) for q=13.

So, clearly in v8.3, something from v7.3 got broken, and something got fixed.

However, this code really ought to work for all n and prime q.
