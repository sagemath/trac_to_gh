My understanding is that some of PRs I merged are related to py3 support of SageTeX.
I have not tried it in on py3 yet - it's not a requirement at the moment that everything  must be py3-compatible, right?

On py2 example.pdf is autogenerated now, as far as I can tell...

I've only tried py2. Now trying on py3:

I've  pushed a commit to sagetex repo which fixes this, and another py2-only leftover. 
https://github.com/sagemath/sagetex/commit/2f3d4be3736e4adb0674ddbf94bda63e0ff7265e

There is still a problem one has to deal with:

```
SageTeX paused on sagetex.tex line 882

I'm getting the weird situation that I am *not* getting any errors when upgrading!  Usually there is a strict 1-1 correspondence between sty file and Sage version necessary.  Do you think I am doing something wrong?

Upon further looking, there was no updating of the key lines in `sagetex.dtx` that give the version number.  I don't know if this matters.

I'm also doing a little maintenance of some non-essential stuff on the GH right now, see what you think - I don't think it should block this py3 business though.

Sorry, I'll make mention of that on GH.  Here is some relevant verbiage.
`sagetex.dtx`:

```

% of the style file and Python module match. This is intended to prevent
% strange version mismatch problems, but if you would like to use
% mismatched sources, you can---at your peril---give the

```
Warning it‚Äôs very important that the file sagetex.sty that LaTeX uses when typesetting your document match the version of SageTeX that Sage is using. If you upgrade your Sage installation, you really should delete all the old versions of sagetex.sty floating around.
Because of this problem, we recommend copying the SageTeX files into your home directory‚Äôs texmf directory (the third method above). Then there is only one thing you need to do (copy a directory) when you upgrade Sage to insure that SageTeX will work properly.
```
So I think somehow we missed something here.
