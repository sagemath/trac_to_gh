This ticket makes `GraphicsArray` derive from a new class, `MultiGraphics`, which is more generic (arbitrary positions of graphics objects on a canvas) and paves the way towards graphics insets in #27866.

`GraphicsArray` is now endowed with a `matplotlib()` function (inheritated from  `MultiGraphics`). This fixes the issues reported in #10466, #10657, #11160 and #12591 (see :comment:3 and [comment:5](#comment%3A5) below for a summary). 
Moreover, this simplifies `sphinx_plot()` (defined in `src/doc/common/conf.py`), avoiding code duplication. 

Beside introducing `matplotlib()` at the graphics array level, two bugs had to be corrected in `Graphics.matplotlib()`:

- `_set_scale` was called on the whole figure, while it should be called on the current subplot
- `tick_params` was called on `figure.get_axes()[0]`, i.e. the first subplot of the figure, while it should be called on the current subplot.

The documentation of `Graphics.matplotlib()` is also improved in this ticket. 

Another bug has been corrected in `Graphics.save()`: contrary to what was claimed in the documentation `g.save("filename")` with `"filename"` having no extension did not save in a `sobj` file but yielded to an error. 

Another modification is the introduction of the helper function `_parse_figsize()` in `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` to avoid code duplication: it is used in `Graphics.matplotlib()`, `MultiGraphics.matplotlib()` and `sphinx_plot()`.

Since the file `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` was already quite long (3736 lines!), the class `GraphicsArray` was moved to the new file `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`, which contains the definition of the base class `MultiGraphics`. This makes things more consistent:
- `src/sage/plot/graphics.py`: only `Graphics` objects
- `src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py`: only `MultiGraphics` objects

Besides the bugs reported in the tickets #10466, #10657, #11160 and #12591, this ticket fixes two other bugs:

- if any plot in the array had a log scale, the latter was erroneously applied to the first plot of the array

- the computation of `nrows` and `ncols` in the function `graphics_array()` (defined in `src/sage/plot/plot.py`) yielded unnecessary large numbers in certain cases. For instance we have in Sage 8.7:

```
sage: graphics_array([plot(sin)]*4, ncols=4)
Graphics Array of size 2 x 4
```
  with the second raw that is entirely blank. With the code in this ticket the output is 

```
Graphics Array of size 1 x 4
```
  This fix explains the change of doctest outputs in `src/sage/categories/finite_posets.py` and `src/sage/repl/rich_output/pretty_print.py`

A preview (including the functionalities introduced in #27866) is available [here](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/plotting/sage/plot/multigraphics.html).

Here is an example summarizing some the `GraphicsArray` issues. In Sage 8.7, the following code:

```
sage: g1 = plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 6), 
....:           axes_labels=[r'$\theta$', r'$\sin(\theta^2)$'], fontsize=14)
sage: g2 = circle((0,0), 1, fill=True, color='red', alpha=0.4, axes=False) \
....:      + text("This is a disk", (0.9, 1.1), color='red', alpha=0.4, 
....:             fontsize=12)
sage: g3 = plot(x^3, (x, 1, 100), axes_labels=[r'$x$', r'$y$'], 
....:           legend_label=r'$y = x^3$', scale='semilogy', frame=True, 
....:           gridlines='minor') \
....:      + text("This is a semilogy plot", (80, 1e5), color='red', alpha=0.4, 
....:             fontsize=12)
sage: graphics_array([g1, g2, g3])
```
results in this figure:

![](graphics_array_bug.png)

We see that 
- the `semilogy` scale asked for `g3` is actually applied to `g1`
- the fontsize asked for `g1` is not taken into account (this is #10657)
- the option `axes=False` asked for `g2` is not taken into account (#10466 and #10657)
- the legend of `g3` is doubled (#12591) 
- the color of the text in `g3` is not the same as in `g2`, while they both defined as `color='red', alpha=0.4` (#12591)

With the code introduced in this ticket, the output becomes

![](graphics_array_ok.png)

We see that all the above issues are gone.

I (as usual the past few years, I am sorry) will not be able to provide code review.  But I think this is a great improvement.  The multigraphics examples at the end of [the example page](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/plotting/sage/plot/multigraphics.html) are particularly impressive, and bring us a long ways toward having a "mathematical" way to interface with the stuff matplotlib provides - I could imagine it being particularly helpful with SageTeX.  Thank you.

As my only suggestion, I would just urge you to be sure all previously "wrong" behavior shows up in the tests section, and that any errors be tested as well.  As an example, you mention
> For instance, G[0, 1] will throw an error.

so might as well put in 

```
sage: G[0,1]
IndexError ...
```
or whatever is appropriate.  We've definitely caught subtle things over the years with those kinds of tests.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A11):
> some failing doctests, see patchbot reports

From all the errors reported bu the patchbots, it seems that only one pertains to this ticket:

```
File "src/sage/plot/multigraphics.py", line 427, in 
sage.plot.multigraphics.MultiGraphics._latex_
Failed example:
    A._latex_()[:40]
Exception raised:
...
      File "/Users/jpalmier/Desktop/Sage/git/patchbot/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py", line 315, in __init__
        "or error in preamble:\n%s" % stdout)
    LatexError: LaTeX returned an error, probably missing font or error in preamble:
...
    ! Package fontspec Error: The font "Bitstream Vera Serif" cannot be found.
```
This doctest is passed on my computer (Ubuntu 18.04). It fails on macOS patchbots. The reason seems to be this Matplotlib issue:
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/10307

Actually, this doctest was borrowed from the previous method `GraphicsArray._latex_()`, since now the method `_latex_()` is defined at the level of the base class `MultiGraphics`. Its failure had not been revealed previously by the macOS patchbots because the doctest was marked with `# not tested`. When I transferred the method `_latex_()` from `GraphicsArray` to `MultiGraphics`, I suppressed the marker `# not tested` because the doctest passed on my computer and I though there was then no reason for such a marker.

I have restored the `# not tested` marker in the above commit, along with a comment about the Matplotlib issue on macOS.

The patchbots also complain about 4 pyflakes issues. However, these reports are spurious for 2 of them:
- 

```
src/doc/common/conf.py:4: 'sage.misc.sagedoc.extlinks' imported but unused
```
  => if one suppresses this import, then the documentation fails to build (stating that `:trac:` is unknown)
- 

```
src/sage/plot/plot.py:585: 'sage.plot.line.line2d' imported but unused
```
  => this line is preceded by the following comment: 

```
# import of line2d below is only for redirection of imports
```
  so I guess one should keep it.

The other 2 pyflakes errors are 

```
src/sage/repl/rich_output/pretty_print.py:34: 'types' imported but unused
src/sage/repl/rich_output/pretty_print.py:35: 'collections' imported but unused
```
These imports have not been introduced by the currrent ticket and I am not sure whether one could removed them without any subtle side effect... 

Besides, the above commit implements the `G[0, 1]` error example suggested by Karl-Dieter in [comment:7](#comment%3A7).

Actually, the previous wrong behaviors were "silent" errors, which showed up only in the figures, as illustrated in [comment:3](#comment%3A3). Their fixes therefore cannot be checked in doctests. I've however chosen the doctests in the EXAMPLES section of `sage.plot.plot.graphics_array` and `sage.plot.multigraphics.GraphicsArray` to include most of (if not all) the issues exhibited in [comment:3](#comment%3A3) and [comment:5](#comment%3A5). But at the end, the fix can only be judged by a human eye.

Not in Sage 8.8.  Let's please to try keep tickets' milestones related to the release in which we actually intend to include them, and in particular the release in which they were *actually* included, especially when closing tickets.
