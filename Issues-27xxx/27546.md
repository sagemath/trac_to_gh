I'm getting these doctest failures on a Python 2 of Sage:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py", line 62, in sage.symbolic.maxima_wrapper.MaximaWrapper.__init__
Failed example:
    s.completions('u.elliptic_',globals())
Expected:
    ['u.elliptic_e', 'u.elliptic_ec', 'u.elliptic_eu', 'u.elliptic_f', 'u.elliptic_kc', 'u.elliptic_pi']
Got:
    [u'u.elliptic_e',
     u'u.elliptic_ec',
     u'u.elliptic_eu',
     u'u.elliptic_f',
     u'u.elliptic_kc',
     u'u.elliptic_pi']
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/symbolic/maxima_wrapper.py", line 81, in sage.symbolic.maxima_wrapper.MaximaWrapper.__getattr__
Failed example:
    s.completions('u.airy_',globals())

    ['u.airy_ai', 'u.airy_bi', 'u.airy_dai', 'u.airy_dbi']
Got:
    [u'u.airy_ai', u'u.airy_bi', u'u.airy_dai', u'u.airy_dbi']
**********************************************************************
```

This is on a system where I also test Python 3, so maybe there is some "corrupted" global state?
