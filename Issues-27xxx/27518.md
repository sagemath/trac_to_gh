Currently sage has implemented Floyd-Warshall algorithm only for graphs with constant edge weight of 1 in cython. Implementation of Floyd warshall algorithm in cython for finding all pair shortest distances(ASAD) can be done. This algorithm can be further improved to find all pair shortest paths(ASAP)(Later).

We can also improve all pair shortest distance algorithm using the technique described in the following paper:-
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/568f/58737e752bf831a3e48036cf5205facce769.pdf
Usually complexity for finding ASAD with matrix multiplication comes with large constants that results in slow running time, But the implementation that is described in the paper can faster the running time for algorithm.

<a id='comment:5'></a>- The usage of edge weights is not fully unified in the graph module. However, many methods have as input parameter `wfunction`, a function that inputs an edge and outputs a number. You should consider adding this parameter as input of the method.

- There is an implementation of Floyd-Warshall algorithm in `boost` https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/libs/graph/doc/floyd_warshall_shortest.html

  and we have an interface with boost `src/sage/graphs/base/boost_*`.

  So you should first expose the boost implementation in Sagemath.

- Moreover, Johnson algorithm is considered faster for sparse graphs (and most of the graphs are sparse).
  - we can use the implementation of boost: `'Johnson_Boost'`
  - we can also use the implementation of `igraph` (an optional package), although not directly exposed. In fact method `shortest_paths` of `igraph` call Johnson algorithm and not Floyd-Warshall for the reason explained here: https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/igraph-help/2009-06/msg00029.html

    when `igraph` is installed, we can do `H = G.igraph_graph()` and then `H.shortest_paths()` with appropriate parameters.

This is a different format than `Graph` in which nodes and edges have different labels than in the `gg`. Although you can make much more efficient code using the backend directly, don't start playing with this if you are not an advanced user !",

`g` is in underlying backend graph format. This is a different format than `Graph` in which nodes and edges have different labels than in the `gg`. Although you can make much more efficient code using the backend directly, don't start playing with this if you are not an advanced user !

<a id='comment:22'></a>Some comments on the current code. Of course, a version directly using boost could be better.

- add an empty line between each input parameter, e.g., before

```
+    - ``predecessors`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return the
```


- you can type some variables. For instance

```diff
-    dist = {}
-    pred = {}
+    cdef dict dist = {}
+    cdef dict pred = {}
```

- you can improve the alignment (although I'm not fully sure of the correct pep8 for this one)

```diff
-        dist = {int_to_v[v]: {int_to_v[w]: correct_type(result[v][w])
-                     for w in range(N) if result[v][w] != sys.float_info.max}
-             for v in range(N)}
+        dist = {int_to_v[v]: {int_to_v[w]: correct_type(result[v][w])
+                              for w in range(N) if result[v][w] != sys.float_info.max}
+                for v in range(N)}
```

- you could define integer variables for `v_to_int[u]`, `v_to_int[v]`

- add a space after `#` in `+            #dst is the weight of the edge (e[0], e[1])`

- no `;` at the end of `+                    continue;`

- use 2 lines for `+                if g.is_directed(): continue`

<a id='comment:34'></a>`get_predecessors`:
- you can shorten the text like

```diff
-    Given the shortest distances between all pairs of vertices in a graph return
-    the predecessors matrix.
+    Return the predecessor matrix from the distance matrix of the graph.
```

- I propose to simplify the weight function definition and to force to give one. So for the text:

```
    - ``weight_function`` -- function; a function that takes as input an edge
      ``(u, v, l)`` and outputs its weight. If ``weight_function`` is ``None``
      and the graph is weighted, then use the edge weight. Otherwise all edges
      have weight 1.
```

- output

```
A dictionary of dictionaries ``pred`` such that ``pred[u][v]`` indicates the predecessor  of `v` in the shortest path from `u` to `v`.
```

- don't do `import sys` inside the loop. If you need it, do that before the loop.


`johnson_shortest_paths`:
- improvement

```diff
-    `v` and ``predecessors[u][v]`` denotes a neighbor `w` of `v` such that
-    it lies on the shortest path from `u` to `v`.
+    `v` and ``predecessors[u][v]`` indicates the predecessor of `w` on a
+    shortest path from `u` to `v`.
```


`floyd_warshall_shortest_paths`:
- avoid double blank lines

- output: same comment than above


In `generic_graph.py`, method `shortest_path_all_pairs`: you must update the output section by removing the note on Johnson algorithm.


Have you tried to use the boost graph to iterate over edges, get edge weights, etc. ?
It's a pity to use the weight function in `get_predecessors` when all weights with correct value are recorded on the edges of the boost graph.
