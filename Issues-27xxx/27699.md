This ticket makes it an error at `configure` time if an Anaconda environment is active 
that does not have the `c-compiler`, `cxx-compiler`, and `fortran-compiler` packages (or equivalent).

Many support requests come from the failure of Sage to build or
to run in the presence of Anaconda.

That would be a conda bug.

If I leave these things uncommented, and ssh into the box, I land in conda's `(base)`.
Then

```
(base) clpc171[~]$ conda deactivate  
clpc171[~]$ 
clpc171[~]$ logout
Connection to clpc171.cs.ox.ac.uk closed.
coml0531@raven:~$ ssh cs
Last login: Mon Jan 13 14:07:02 2020 from raven.linux.ox.ac.uk
(base) clpc171[~]$ 
```
and I land back into conda, as you see...

I do have `~/.bash_profile` - but it was not used by `conda init` (which I did last month, so it's a pretty recent install).

I'll move that chunk to `~/.bash_profile` and verify whether it allows to build.

Isuru, is this not a conda bug, installing that stuff into `~/.bashrc` ?

to make it not initialize by default.

FWIW, I successfully built sage from scratch after `conda deactivate`. But this is with a miniconda installation with a clean `base` environment.

I'll test again on Linux with a dirty `base` environment that has lots of `bin/*-config` executables - this was the problem in #27941.

If there is such a bug in the testsuite, we'll fix it. 

This really isn't specific to conda. Users' interactive shell configuration in  ~/.bashrc could also define all kinds of incompatible `alias`es or print arbitrary output etc. that could confuse a doctest.

> Can we test that Conda has `auto_activate_base=false` - if we are outside conda?

I don't know what you mean by that.

> As well, the docs ought to mention [comment:23](#comment%3A23) (atm they only tell how to use conda, but they also ought to tell how not to)

The added docs already mention `conda deactivate`. And that is sufficient. 

Telling the user that they have to disable conda by editing their init scripts, or uninstall conda, or change their conda configuration --- all of this is going in the wrong direction for Sage.
