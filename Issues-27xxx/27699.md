This ticket makes it an error at `configure` time if an Anaconda environment is active 
that does not have the `c-compiler`, `cxx-compiler`, and `fortran-compiler` packages (or equivalent).

Many support requests come from the failure of Sage to build or
to run in the presence of Anaconda.

> The conda initialization code belongs into `~/.bash_profile`, not `~/.bashrc`. This is where `conda init` puts it. It is supposed to be invoked for login shells only.

I think it may be a difference in `conda init` behavior between mac and linux.

Isuru, is this not a conda bug, installing that stuff into `~/.bashrc` ?

You could do,

```
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```

to make it not initialize by default.

If there is such a bug in the testsuite, we'll fix it. 

This really isn't specific to conda. Users' interactive shell configuration in  ~/.bashrc could also define all kinds of incompatible `alias`es or print arbitrary output etc. that could confuse a doctest.

> Can we test that Conda has `auto_activate_base=false` - if we are outside conda?


I don't know what you mean by that.

> As well, the docs ought to mention comment:23 (atm they only tell how to use conda, but they also ought to tell how not to)


The added docs already mention `conda deactivate`. And that is sufficient. 

Telling the user that they have to disable conda by editing their init scripts, or uninstall conda, or change their conda configuration --- all of this is going in the wrong direction for Sage.
