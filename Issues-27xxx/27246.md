2 failing doctests were due to the presence of `\I` in a graph6 string. This is fixed using `\\I`. On the way we reformat the graph6 string in 80 columns mode.

The other failing doctest is due to the test

```
if edge_labels and sorted(self.edge_labels()) != sorted(other.edge_labels()):
```
This issue was also reported in #27232 with an example failing in both py2 and py3. So it's resolution is done in #27232.

Keywords: py3, graph
