Currently we have to write:

```
sage: polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>(3,2)")
```
or

```
sage: getattr(polymake, "tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>")(3, 2)
```
or

```
sage: polymake.function_call("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>", [3, 2])
```
because the template brackets cannot become part of the Python function name, so the normal `.` syntax cannot work.
 
(Also, but not the point of this ticket - #27736: Polymake: Turn polymake applications into objects with directories.)

Also, 

```
    polymake("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>")(3,2)
```
does not work. It looks for an overloaded function without arguments, which fails:

```
    TypeError: no matching overloaded instance of Polymake::tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>()
```

Also, 

```
sage: polymake.call("tropical::uniform_linear_space<Max>", 3, 2)
```
does not work -- the undocumented and untested `call` method passes the `args` tuple to `function_call`, which expects lists instead of tuples.
