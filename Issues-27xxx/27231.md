Allow to call nauty's directg command from sage.\\

This is implemented as a `DiGraph` generator (file: `digraph_generators.py`).

Note to reviewers: Any idea for useful examples in documentation is welcome.

This is a nice addition. Thank you. Below are some comments.


* You are not returning a list but an iterator.

```diff
-        Returns a list which creates digraphs from nauty's directg program.
+        Return an iterator yielding digraphs using nauty's ``directg`` program.
```


* Could you document the role of parameter `graphs`. It is not completely obvious.

* 

```diff
-        - ``graphs`` (iterable) -- A :class:`Graph` or an iterable containing
-          :class:`Graph`.
+        - ``graphs`` -- a :class:`Graph` or an iterable containing :class:`Graph`
```
* Also, add an empty line between parameters.

* As for `graphs.nauty_geng`, you could add parameter `debug`. 

* I don't know which is best between the loop `for l in out.split('\n'):` and the `while` loop of  `graphs.nauty_geng`. Are the programs different ?


* 

```diff
-            if l != '' and l[0] == '&':
+            if l and l[0] == '&':
```


* Have you tried `watercluster2` ? according to the documentation of nauty http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/nug26.pdf, it is a faster alternative to `directg`.


* `directg` and `watercluster2` generate all possible orientations of the input graphs, include both directions. Currently, we have a tools for iterating over all possible orientations of a graph:
  - `orientations` return an iterator over orientations
  - `strong_orientations_iterator` return an iterator over all strong orientations of a graph `G`
  You can add a test to show that 1) `directg/watercluster2` generates more graphs than what we get with `orientations`,  and 2) that each digraph obtained with `orientations` is in the set of digraphs obtained with `directg`.

Yes my mistake ! It's a generator to be accurate. My first version used to return a list. \\
Thanks for noticing that.

>

The impacting difference between `geng` and `directg` is that `directg` need an input file and `geng` work with command parameter only. \\

That's why i use `Popen.communicate` as it allow to give an input "file" to `directg`

The drawback is, if i am right, that with communicate reading stdout is in one go where we can read line by line for `geng`. I will try a line by line read with the communicate output, just in case i am wrong.\\

> 
> * Have you tried `watercluster2` ? according to the documentation of nauty http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/nug26.pdf, it is a faster alternative to `directg`.\\


No i was unaware of that. 
I implemented this ticket for a sage user needing `directg`. I will look at `watercluster2` and modify my ticket with it if it works well.\\

Thanks for your comments.

**Comparison `watercluster2` and `directg`**

1 - For generating/counting digraph without generating output watercluster2 is way faster.

```
(sage-sh) vklein@tuono:sage$ time geng -c 7 | directg -o -u
>A geng -cd1D6 n=7 e=6-21
>Z 853 graphs generated in 0.00 sec
>A directg -ou
>Z 853 graphs read from stdin; 2120098 digraphs generated; 1.71 sec

real    0m1.734s
user    0m1.716s
sys 0m0.000s
(sage-sh) vklein@tuono:sage$ time geng -c 7 | watercluster2 S
>A geng -cd1D6 n=7 e=6-21
>Z 853 graphs generated in 0.00 sec
Number of directed graphs: 2120098 

real    0m0.233s
user    0m0.234s
sys 0m0.000s
```

If you take the time to generate output into account the result is less clear.\\
`watercluster2` has two output format T-code (option T) or a custom binary format (option B).\\
For the tests below the two functions used just read the command output.

```
sage: time out = digraphs.nauty_watercluster2(graphs.nauty_geng("-c 9 9:12"), op
....: tions="B S")
CPU times: user 2.42 s, sys: 571 ms, total: 2.99 s
Wall time: 7.12 s
sage: time out = digraphs.nauty_watercluster2(graphs.nauty_geng("-c 9 9:12"), op
....: tions="T S")
CPU times: user 5.65 s, sys: 1.9 s, total: 7.55 s
Wall time: 33.9 s
sage: time out = digraphs.nauty_directg(graphs.nauty_geng("-c 9 9:12"), options=
....: "-o")
CPU times: user 2.02 s, sys: 591 ms, total: 2.61 s
Wall time: 10.3 s
```

`watercluster2` is slower than `directg` with T-code output and slightly faster with binary output.\\
My current problem with the binary output is that what i get is not consistent with the specifications (Which are in watercluster2 source code) and therefore i don't know how to build DiGraph with that.

2 - Command options.

`directg` and `watercluster2` have options with no equivalent :

`directg`'s options:

```
   -e# | -e#:#  specify a value or range of the total number of arcs
   -f#  Use only the subgroup that fixes the first # vertices setwise
    -s#/#  Make only a fraction of the orientations: The first integer is
            the part number (first is 0) and the second is the number of
            parts. Splitting is done per input graph independently.
```

`watercluster2`'s options:

```
The option ix restricts the maximum indegree to x.
The option oy restricts the maximum outdegree to y.
```

I don't know what is the most useful set of options between these two.

I guess we should stick with `directg` for now.

Thanks for the benchmark.

I agree to stay with `directg`. You can add a `.. TODO::`` block explaining that a future task is to interface `watercluster2`.


Also, can you do

```diff
-                yield DiGraph(l[1:])
+                yield DiGraph(l[1:], format='dig6')
```

and add tests like `if not graphs: ...`, `if not input: ...`, `if not g: ...` to avoid computations when the input graph/list of graphs is empty.

Replying to [dcoudert](#comment%3A5):
>  You can add a test to show that 1) `directg/watercluster2` generates more graphs than what we get with `orientations`,  and 2) that each digraph obtained with `orientations` is in the set of digraphs obtained with `directg`.

>

Well my results are :

```
sage: len(list(digraphs.nauty_directg(graphs.PetersenGraph())))
121545
sage: len(list(graphs.PetersenGraph().orientations()))
32768
sage: K5 = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
sage: len(list(digraphs.nauty_directg(K5)))
582
sage: len(list(K5.orientations()))
1024
```

For K5 `directg` give me less digraphs than `orientations`. Is it an inconsistency ?

But if you expect that the method return `DiGraph()`, then an extra test like `if isinstance(graphs, Graph):...` is needed. I let you decide which is best.

All comments implemented.\\
The case with `graphs == Graph()` was really a bug because `directg` manage the input of empty graphs (graph6 string `?`) and return an empty digraph.\\
Note that to stick with this generator description i prefer to let `directg` do this job rather than doing a `yield DiGraph()` manually.

Thank you for your comments.

* In the tests, I don't understand why the error is raised only after `next(g)` and not directly during the call to `digraphs.nauty_directg`. Is it normal ?

Yes that's how python's generators works. Calling the generator's function create the generator object but don't begin to execute the code inside the function:

```
>>> def generator():
	print('hey')
	yield 1

	
>>> g = generator()
>>> g
<generator object generator at 0x00000198B7D22CF0>
>>> next(g)
hey
1
```
