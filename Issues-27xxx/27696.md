With Python 3 doctesting, `long` has been automatically converted to `int`. It would be better to not have such a big difference in the behavior of doctesting vs. ordinary Sage usage: with Python 3, evaluating `long(3)` would fail at the command line but work in doctesting.

First we should deprecate `__long__` methods for Sage classes, and we should also designate doctests involving `long(...)` as being `py2` only. Once enough of those tasks have been complete, we can make this change to the doctesting framework.

---

See #27826 for a collection of deprecations. This is not complete: that ticket does not deprecate `__long__` for integers and rational numbers.

See #27829 for marking some doctests with `# py2`.

There are a few places where there should be deprecations but there are not: in rational.pyx and integer.pyx, deprecations lead to deprecations warnings all over the place in the Sage library. In `complex_double.pyx`, for example, the `__long__` method just raises an error, and it seemed that deprecating such a method has no effect: the deprecation warning is not printed, just the error is.

This was done this way very intentionally in #24559, in large part to avoid such a massive patch like this.

It would be better I think to wait until Python 2 support is dropped completely.

```
sage: long(blah)

We should also deprecate `__long__` for various classes. When the appropriate pieces are in place, turn off the conversion `long --> int` in Python 3 doctesting.

The current situation is very misleading, where a doctest will pass with Python 3 but the same code will fail if run by hand.

There are many cases like that where the doctests don't work quite the same on Python 3 but in mostly trivial ways which are made transparent by the doctest framework.  I think that's ok, personally.

However, I do like the idea of adding deprecation warnings to `__long__`.  What if as a middle ground we started with just that part?
