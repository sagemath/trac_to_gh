This is basically repackaging the existing code from `sage.env` that is used to set the `SINGULAR_SO` variable, but making it a bit more generic and flexible.

This will be useful as well for #26930 to get the correct libgap path.  It also tries to be a bit more flexible than the old code, so as to reduce the need for patching in some distros, though this does not guarantee to eliminate that need altogether.
