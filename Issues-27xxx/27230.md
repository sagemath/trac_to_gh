This is basically repackaging the existing code from `sage.env` that is used to set the `SINGULAR_SO` variable, but making it a bit more generic and flexible.

This will be useful as well for #26930 to get the correct libgap path.  It also tries to be a bit more flexible than the old code, so as to reduce the need for patching in some distros, though this does not guarantee to eliminate that need altogether.

This is built on top of #27040, with which it would otherwise conflict.

For #26930 the idea then would be to add

```
LIBGAP_SO = _get_shared_lib_filename('gap')
```

IMHO a better fit would be src/sage/libs/ - as this is really something to do with libs...

`env.py` is a central repository of variables so it fits there. But I am open to discussion about splitting some of it in the future if there is a good rationale. But that will be in the future. 

Now this will remove a bit of patch in sage-on-gentoo in a nice generic way. The amount of patching of sage in sage-on-gentoo has gone down considerably.

Addressed [comment:16](#comment%3A16) and obvious bugs from [comment:15](#comment%3A15) (in the latter case, it previously worked on Cygwin but I did not test on Cygwin after the refactoring I did; I'm confident now that it's right-enough).

Happy to shuffle things around to different locations as well, though keep in mind everything in `sage.env` should work easily with minimal, if any, imports from other sub-packages in Sage (at least anything that does anything less trivial that define a few pure-Python classes and functions).
