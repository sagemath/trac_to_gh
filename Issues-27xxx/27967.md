In RecursivelyEnumeratedSet_graded.breadth_first_search_iterator, use list for next_level instead of set in order to iterate over his elements in the same order on each run.
    
This fix python3 errors inthe combinat.root_system.weyl_group and root_lattice_realisations module.

But this modification causes some new doctests failures in weylgroup :

```
vklein@tuono:~/odk/sage$ sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_group.py 
too many failed tests, not using stored timings

I need help to look if the two results of `W.simple_reflections()` are both correct or not and what's the result of `W.has_coerce_map_from(W5)` is supposed to be.

I do not like the idea of having two structures (list + set) to store the same elements. This may make the algorithm use twice as much memory. There must be a way to achieve this using only one.

Also, why should the enumeration order be certified? This is not claimed in the documentation. I know it would be very nice for the doctests of other codes using it, but I believe it is an error to expect such a thing. I would rather think the code using RES should fix themselves instead.

The code using RES can't really fix that by sorting the results because the results are potentially too big and will take too much time to sort and therefore cancel the goal of using a generator.

The only other way i can think of now is tagging the tests with #py2 #py3 and hope order will remain the same across configuration and future python3 version.

However, I am also getting another doctest failure, which leads me to this, which might be a serious problem.

Python 2:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',3], implementation="permutation")
sage: Permutation('(1,7)(2,5)(4,6)(8,11)(10,12)') in W
False
```

Python 3:

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(['A',3], implementation="permutation")
sage: Permutation('(1,7)(2,5)(4,6)(8,11)(10,12)') in W
True
```

Is this a serious problem? It seems to me that `W` should be the same group, regardless of the version of Python.

The following change can improve memory usage, at least if the branching factor is large, say 2 or more.

In other words, it is possible to explore one level further before running out of memory.

`W` is a permutation group on the roots `W.roots()`, so the concrete representation in terms of permutations depends on the order of these roots, which differs between Python 2 and 3. Hence, this should not be a serious problem.

If this appears in the doctests (?), in order to obtain consistent results between Python versions, this could be solved by writing the permutation as a conjugation with the permutation that sorts the roots. That is, unless `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` itself is changed as suggested in this ticket.

Regarding the first new doctest failure from the ticket description (`W.has_coerce_map_from(W5)` returning `True`): with this branch, I get

```
sage: W = WeylGroup(["B",4], implementation="permutation")
sage: W5 = WeylGroup(["C",4], implementation="permutation")
sage: W.gens() == W5.gens()
True
```
I'm guessing that's what's going on: the identity map is a coercion map in this case.

The documentation is not consistent with the code. The documentation for `_coerce_map_from_` says `Return ``True`` if ``P`` is a Weyl group of the same Cartan type and ``False`` otherwise.` The code says

```
        if isinstance(P, WeylGroup_gens) and P.cartan_type() is self.cartan_type():
            return True
        return super(WeylGroup_permutation, self)._coerce_map_from_(P)
```
So if `P` has the same Cartan type, return `True`, but otherwise, call something else: don't just automatically return `False` as the documentation says. I'm not sure what to do here.

No – to be more precise, my criticism is just about commit `9c19a38` introducing the use of `OrderedDict`. All the other changes on the current branch look good to me and I will review them positively. The remaining doctest failures are not caused by `OrderedDict` specifically, but by the change in iteration order in general, so should still be fixed:

```

sage/categories/finite_complex_reflection_groups.py
```

> You proposed some other explicit changes in[comment:15](#comment%3A15), along with "This solution should also be applied to the generic (non-graded) case."


Yes, I still think those changes would be useful, but since this ticket is primarily concerned with making the tests pass with Python 3, let us keep those changes for a follow-up ticket. Changing the non-graded case would probably entail new doctest failures.

> By the way, is there a good way to test memory usage, say something analogous to `%timeit`?


Not that I know of. You can use `sys.getsizeof()` to get the (shallow) size in bytes of an object, but it only works for types that implement `__sizeof__` (built-in types do so).
