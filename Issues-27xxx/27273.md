Presently SymmetricGroupRepresentation and SymmetricGroupAlgebra can only be found either by googling or by looking through the combinat's module index. 

By right they should be better visible, and SymmetricGroupRepresentation should be cross-linked in Groups docs.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27273
