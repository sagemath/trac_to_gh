The documentation for the method `matroids.utilities.lift_cross_ratios` says <code>This method will create a unique candidate representation ``Z``</code>. It gives different answers in Python 2 and Python 3, yielding a doctest failure with py3. Is the representation not unique and both are valid answers? The code contains several loops over dictionaries, and so the loops can happen in different orders; does that matter?

In particular, with Python 3:

```
File "src/sage/matroids/utilities.py", line 543, in sage.matroids.utilities.lift_cross_ratios
Failed example:
    Z
Expected:
    [ 1  0  1  1  1]
    [ 1  1  0  0  z]
    [ 0  1 -z -1  0]
Got:

    [ 1  1  0  0  z]

A really drastic fix would be to just delete this function entirely, and also its companion `lift_map`. They are only used in one place, in the `representation` method in `linear_matroid.pyx`, and then only if an optional argument `lift_map` is specified, but no doctests use `lift_map` and so the code is untested. That makes me wary of keeping it around: does it actually work? Will it continue to work with Python 3?

A proper fix to this ticket would add doctests to `representation` which use `lift_map`.

If we end up deleting those two functions, these changes would also be required:

I am the original author of this code.

The output matrix Z is constructed so that a certain collection of entries is equal to 1. This collection is exactly the set of T chosen in line 567--569 of utilities.py.

```
    T = set()
    for C in G.connected_components():
        T.update(G.subgraph(C).min_spanning_tree())
``` 
From the failed doctest, it appears that in py3 the output has a 1 in position (3,4) instead of (3,2) in py2. So T is constructed differently under py3.
G is just the support graph of the input matrix, and does not depend on how it is constructed. So this tells me that `Graph.min_spanning_tree()` has changed its behaviour in py3. It the new behaviour of this routine is consistent between different calls, then the output of `lift_cross_ratios` will be consistent as well. So then it will suffice to adjust the output Z in the doctest.

Otherwise, it may be possible to force consistency `Graph.min_spanning_tree()` in py3, but I do not know how. Unfortunately I cannot test this either -- don't have Sage set up for working with py3.  

Sorry I cannot do more. Hope this helps.

Thanks very much for the comments. `min_spanning_tree` has indeed changed from Python 2 to Python 3, so we will just have different outputs for the doctests for the two versions.

Here is a branch which has different doctests for py2 and py3, and it also adds a doctest for the `representation` method which uses the `lift_map` optional argument. It also has different outputs depending on the version of Python.

I think it is likely that the difference is with `min_spanning_tree`. At least for the doctest for `lift_cross_ratios`, I checked the particular matrix involved, and py2 and py3 give different spanning trees for the graph produced from that matrix. I couldn't see a way to get the same spanning tree, hence different doctests depending on the version of Python.
