Trying this in 8.7.b7

```

The PD code used to enter the enter the link is not valid, since it is not compatible with an orientation of the strands. A correct one does work:


```
sage: LS = Link([[6, 10, 1, 7],[7, 19, 8, 18],[11, 6, 12, 5],[17, 12, 18, 13],[4, 16, 5, 17],[15, 11, 16, 14],[13, 3, 14, 4],[19, 1, 20, 2],[2, 9, 3, 8],[9, 20, 10, 15]])
sage: LS.braid()
(s0*s1^-1)^2*s0*(s2*s1^-1)^2*s2
```
