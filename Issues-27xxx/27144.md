<div id="comment:1" align="right">Comment 1</div>

I have marked all doctests of method `print_triconnected_components()` as `Not tested`.
This method was useful during the development phase of this code, but it brings little information to the user.

<div id="comment:4" align="right">Comment 4</div>

I have removed the "not tested" statements.

I don't know how to make the failing doctest (it's twice the same test in different parts of the code) work on both py2 and py3. It's not only the order in which the components are displayed that differs, but also the labels of virtual edges inside the components. The label of a virtual edge depends on the step of the algorithm at which it has been created, and this differs in py2 and py3.

The interest of class `TriconnectivitySPQR` is to decompose the graph using the linear time algorithm and build the SPQR-tree. It could directly return the SPQR-tree. The added value of method `print_triconnected_components()` is therefore very limited.
So I'm in favor of removing this method after a deprecation. I will do that.
