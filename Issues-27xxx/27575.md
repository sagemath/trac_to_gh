The Three.js viewer for notebooks already had a fallback to the online CDN when the local files are not loaded, which was silently failing. This small change fixes that.

The "mooted" discussion is about such a fallback should be on by default. Do I get it right that the fallback was simply broken, and the branch here fixes it, so that it silently works?

A regular string in JS needs line continuation markers. The back ticks turn the string into a template literal, which is allowed to include new lines.

After reviewing the code in #22670 that added this fallback, I reverted to a normal JS string. That way older browsers and other environments should be supported.

As a JS person, I would never think of copying an entire library into every file I create. While it is a possible solution, it just doesn't seem elegant. This fallback is intended for files shared on the web, which implies internet access to a CDN.

Please describe what problems you encountered at Luminy. Was there any lack of internet access? If this fallback had been working properly, then perhaps there would have been no issues.

Sure. That makes sense.

While it is a possible solution, it just doesn't seem elegant.\n\nI agree that it's not elegant. But you probably wouldn't dynamically emit script tags, would you?\n\n> This fallback is intended for files shared on the web, which implies internet access to a CDN.\n\nPersonally, I really don't mind if this code contacts a CDN but one could argue that this could also run in a local webserver that is not meant to access the internet.\n\n> Please describe what problems you encountered at Luminy. Was there any lack of internet access? If this fallback had been working properly, then perhaps there would have been no issues.\n\nThere was no lack of internet access. I forget what the setup was unfortunately. Somehow this was served through an interface/web server that could not resolve the path to the local three.js assets. I assume that this fallback would have fixed the problem.\n\nSo, I'll set this to positive review as this definitely fixes an existing bug (currently, we are emitting JavaScript code with a Syntax Error.) Whether this is a privacy issue in the first place can be discussed in a new issue imho. Feel free to set that one to critical if you have strong feelings about it.",

> As a JS person, I would never think of copying an entire library into every file I create. While it is a possible solution, it just doesn't seem elegant.

I agree that it's not elegant. But you probably wouldn't dynamically emit script tags, would you?

> This fallback is intended for files shared on the web, which implies internet access to a CDN.

Personally, I really don't mind if this code contacts a CDN but one could argue that this could also run in a local webserver that is not meant to access the internet.

> Please describe what problems you encountered at Luminy. Was there any lack of internet access? If this fallback had been working properly, then perhaps there would have been no issues.

There was no lack of internet access. I forget what the setup was unfortunately. Somehow this was served through an interface/web server that could not resolve the path to the local three.js assets. I assume that this fallback would have fixed the problem.

So, I'll set this to positive review as this definitely fixes an existing bug (currently, we are emitting JavaScript code with a Syntax Error.) Whether this is a privacy issue in the first place can be discussed in a new issue imho. Feel free to set that one to critical if you have strong feelings about it.

Another place where this does not work without the CDN is nbviewer.jupyter.org.
