I discovered that part of the problem I've been having with OpenBLAS is that there is a pretty severe memory leak that gets worse any time an application with OpenBLAS loaded in it forks.

**Upstream issue:** https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2063

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2064

I already have a patch that I'll posting a PR for shortly, and would like to include in Sage.  I'm just testing the patch now with Sage.
