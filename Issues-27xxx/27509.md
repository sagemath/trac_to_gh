I discovered that part of the problem I've been having with OpenBLAS is that there is a pretty severe memory leak that gets worse any time an application with OpenBLAS loaded in it forks.

**Upstream issue:** https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2063

**Upstream PR:** https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/2064

I already have a patch that I'll posting a PR for shortly, and would like to include in Sage.  I'm just testing the patch now with Sage.

If we can still have this one last patch applied for 8.7 that would be ideal, as this is a fairly bad issue.  But it only especially becomes an issue when building and running the tests; probably less so in normal usage where running many subprocesses is slightly less common (except for some areas).  I can possibly apply the patch and build openblas manually if absolute need be.
