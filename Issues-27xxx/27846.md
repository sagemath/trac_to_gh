Metaticket to track tasks and sub-tickets related to RSK refactoring project in GSoC'19.

Note: RSK stands for the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence or algorithm,
a combinatorial bijection between certain matrices with integer entries and
certain pairs of Young tableaux, see
[Wikipedia: RSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson–Schensted–Knuth_correspondence).
