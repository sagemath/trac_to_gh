<a id='comment:12'>**Comment 12:**</a>
Perhaps a cleaner fix here would be to change the doctest to

```
g,m = f.reduced_form(smallest_coeffs=False); m
```

The matrix is it producing for the conjugation is always an integer matrix, but just working over RR to conjugate and then conjugate by the inverse is introducing numerical error, so the resulting function is not an exact match of the original. So, the error that is cropping up in the doctest actually has nothing to do with the functionality of .reduced_form(), rather it is just a consequence of conjugating over a numerical field.

You should probably do the same thing for the doctest immediately following as I would have expected the same kind of issue over CC.
