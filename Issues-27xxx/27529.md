    Check that Sage refuses to run doctests from a directory whose
    permissions are too loose.  We create a world-writable directory
    inside a safe temporary directory to test this::

        sage: d = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), "test")
        sage: os.mkdir(d)
        sage: os.chmod(d, 0o777)
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-tp", "1", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
```
right? First, they don't work at all with Python 3 because of `subprocess.call(['python', ...`, and second, they don't work with an unpatched Python. We can fix the second of these by tagging the doctests `# build`. We could fix the first in a less than ideal way by tagging the doctests `# py2`.
