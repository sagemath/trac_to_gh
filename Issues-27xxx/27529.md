hmm. The change in doctest control breaks one doctest in python3:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/control.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/doctest/control.py", line 630, in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.test_safe_directory
Failed example:
    DC.test_safe_directory(d)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```
I am not sure what to do :
- undo this change ?
- tag the doctest with # py2 ?

That's interesting. It means two things if I am not mistaken.
* python3 does allow you to run stuff from unsafe directories just like python2

See #26457 which discusses the possibility of removing this test altogether, or #25358 (which would conflict with this) for an alternative middle-ground.

I would rather we go ahead and do one of these than make fixes to a test that's dubious in the first place.

```
    Check that Sage refuses to run doctests from a directory whose
    permissions are too loose.  We create a world-writable directory
    inside a safe temporary directory to test this::

        sage: d = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), "test")
        sage: os.mkdir(d)
        sage: os.chmod(d, 0o777)
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-tp", "1", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
```
right? First, they don't work at all with Python 3 because of `subprocess.call(['python', ...`, and second, they don't work with an unpatched Python. We can fix the second of these by tagging the doctests `# build`. We could fix the first in a less than ideal way by tagging the doctests `# py2`.
