hmm. The change in doctest control breaks one doctest in python3:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/doctest/control.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/doctest/control.py", line 630, in sage.doctest.control.DocTestController.test_safe_directory
Failed example:
    DC.test_safe_directory(d)
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
```
I am not sure what to do :
- undo this change ?
- tag the doctest with # py2 ?

That's interesting. It means two things if I am not mistaken.
* python3 does allow you to run stuff from unsafe directories just like python2
* the doctest and possibly the functionality never worked with python3. That bit must have always called python2.

1. `doctest` is not tested by `python3-known-passing.txt`, so that doctest failure doesn't have to prevent merging this ticket. The fix makes sense, despite that it breaks a doctest.

2. I posted about this failure on https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/_pH7bjQmw5A/IJz_zlMxAwAJ but that thread didn't come to a conclusion.

I'm also not too happy with this situation, but at least this edited test reflects better the reality that it's failing on Python 3. Note that this specific test has always been somewhat controversial.

See #26457 which discusses the possibility of removing this test altogether, or #25358 (which would conflict with this) for an alternative middle-ground.

I would rather we go ahead and do one of these than make fixes to a test that's dubious in the first place.

And just to make sure I understand correctly: there are two issues with the tests

```
    Check that Sage refuses to run doctests from a directory whose
    permissions are too loose.  We create a world-writable directory
    inside a safe temporary directory to test this::

        sage: d = os.path.join(tmp_dir(), "test")
        sage: os.mkdir(d)
        sage: os.chmod(d, 0o777)
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-t", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
        sage: (out, err, ret) = test_executable(["sage", "-tp", "1", "nonexisting.py"], cwd=d)
        sage: print(err)
        ...
        RuntimeError: refusing to run doctests...
```
right? First, they don't work at all with Python 3 because of `subprocess.call(['python', ...`, and second, they don't work with an unpatched Python. We can fix the second of these by tagging the doctests `# build`. We could fix the first in a less than ideal way by tagging the doctests `# py2`.
