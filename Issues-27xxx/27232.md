This code led to finding this bug in the `is_isomorphic` method.

Here is a simple working example:

```
sage: m1 = matrix(ZZ, [[1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1], [1, 0, -1]])
sage: m2 = matrix(ZZ, [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, 0]])
```

The two matrices are equal up to permutation of rows and columns:

```
sage: m1.is_permutation_of(m2)
True
```

But, not over `CyclotomicField`s:

```
sage: CF = CyclotomicField(1)
sage: p1 = matrix(CF, [[1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1], [1, 0, -1]])
sage: p2 = matrix(CF, [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, 0]])
sage: p1.is_permutation_of(p2)
False
```

Even with 2 is also does not work:

```
sage: CF = CyclotomicField(2)
sage: p1 = matrix(CF, [[1, -1, -1], [-1, -1, -1], [1, 0, -1]])
sage: p2 = matrix(CF, [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, 0]])
sage: p1.is_permutation_of(p2)
False
```

This error is provoked at the level of graphs:

```
sage: g1 = p1.as_bipartite_graph()
sage: g2 = p2.as_bipartite_graph()
sage: sorted(g1.edge_labels())
[1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 0, -1]
sage: sorted(g2.edge_labels())
[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 0]
```

Right! :-S I was quite puzzled when saw that this was done!!

That step in the `_is_isomorphic` method of graph with the option `edge_labels=True` should be repaired so that it makes sense...

The above code came up while looking at two character tables coming from two isomorphic groups. They should be equal up to permutation of columns and rows, but it was returns `False` !!!

Agreed. Many progresses have been done in the graph module and a lot remains to be done. Help fixing problems / reviewing tickets is more than welcome :P

I tried the example with Python 2 and 3 and the answer is `False` in both cases and it is effectively due to the test `if edge_labels and sorted(self.edge_labels()) != sorted(other.edge_labels()):` that is `False` here for the reason explained above (#comment:2).

Do you have any suggestion on how to compare the 2 lists of edge labels knowing that edge labels can be unhashable ?

May be this ticket could be moved to the graph component as it will only touch method `is_isomorphic` ? Could make it easier to trac changes in the graph module...

I tried many stuff today without success. This is really one of the major issue of the graph module.

We can do a simple hack to replace the test `sorted(self.edge_labels()) != sorted(other.edge_labels())` in method `is_isomorphic` of `generic_graph.py`. This is not nice/efficient but it does the job.

```
                def same_edge_labels(self_labels, other_labels):
                    """
                    Check that the lists have exactly the same content.
                    This is slower than sorting and checking equality, but safe
                    for Python3.
                    """
                    for label in self_labels:
                        if label in other_labels:
                            other_labels.remove(label)
                        else:
                            return False
                    return not other_labels
```

However, this is far from enough as method `graph_isom_equivalent_non_edge_labeled_graph` sorts many times lists of edge labels. I tried to remove these sortings, but I don't have a sufficient understanding of the methods to know what is correct, what is not and more importantly, what is assumed as input/output of other methods like those of `sage.groups.perm_gps.partn_ref.refinement_graphs`, etc.

I'm pushing in a public branch what I tried to do. Feel free to modify/correct/etc. and even suppress if you believe it is not a good approach to fix the problem. It's breaking doctests in `is_isomorphic` and `canonical_label`...


PS: The cost to pay for accepting anything as an edge label is really high :(

There is indeed a general problem with labels (not only for graphs). Ideally, when one has a structure with labels, one should be able to specify

I pushed a new branch to fix the issues with `is_isomorphic`, and in particular with `graph_isom_equivalent_non_edge_labeled_graph`. It seems to fix all remaining failing doctests in `generic_graph.py` in Python 3.

It took me some time to understand the method, and in particular why and when sort is needed. I reduced the number of places where sort is used, and used `sorted(..., key=str)` to sort hazardous objects (i.e., list of edge labels). For sure some users will invent another kind of edge labels for which this will not work, but unless we implement everywhere the remarks of #comment:7, and so force the user to specify the sort method, I don't see how we can magically answer all requirements.



Help needed: I use method `filterfalse` from itertools, but it'ss called `ifilterfalse` in Python 2 and `filterfalse` in Python 3. I used a try .. except to import it, but there is certainly a smarter way.


Please review, check, double check, do some tests, etc.

Get rid of `filterfalse`:

```diff
-    for label in filterfalse(edge_labels.__contains__, G.edge_labels()):
+    for label in G.edge_labels():
+        if label in edge_labels:
+            continue
```
Although I might also unroll `G.edge_labels()` and do

```python
    for _,_,label in G.edge_iterator():
        if label in edge_labels:
            continue
```
