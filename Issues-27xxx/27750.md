We remove the modification of LD_LIBRARY_PATH during the build of package flint, which is unnecessary in sage and not robust (as previously discussed in #24575, it fails on Arch Linux).
This is already merged in upstream FLINT (trunk): https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/450
but upstream does not maintain the branch flint-2.5 on which our Sage package is based.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
