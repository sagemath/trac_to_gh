We remove the modification of LD_LIBRARY_PATH during the build of package flint, which is unnecessary in sage and not robust (as previously discussed in #24575, it fails on Arch Linux).
This is already merged in upstream FLINT (trunk): https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/pull/450
but upstream does not maintain the branch flint-2.5 on which our Sage package is based.
