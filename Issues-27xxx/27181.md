Fix doctests in:
- `vertex_boundary`. We now sort the output in the doctest
- `neighbor_iterator`: again this is due to the use of `set` in `_backend.iterator_nbrs` leading to different orderings in py2 and py3. We change the example to a more stable one
- `degree`: we mark doctests as py2 and py3
- `degree_iterator`: we mark doctests as py2 and py3

**Keywords:** py3, graph
