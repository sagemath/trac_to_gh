<a id='comment:7'></a>2 remarks:

- the text for the doctest could provide more information like `Edges of the spanning trees can be labeled or unlabeled (:trac:`27557`)::`

- when calling `_recursive_..`, you don't need to write `labels=labels`.

```diff
-            return _recursive_spanning_trees(Graph(self, immutable=False, loops=False), forest, labels=labels)
+            return _recursive_spanning_trees(Graph(self, immutable=False, loops=False), forest, labels)
```

It would be nice to also get `spanning_tree_iterator()`. May be for another ticket.
