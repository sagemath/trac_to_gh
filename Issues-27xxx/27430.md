```
sage: _ = P.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')
sage: fricas.eval("Z")
sage: fricas.eval("x")
```

If it does, I can prepare a non-leaking statement.  Roughly, it will be

```
(fricas([x]*n).diagonalMatrix() - fricas(c0)).smith().diagonal().sage()
```

I admit, that I do not know how the matrix design currently works, but possibly `sage.matrix.matrix2.smith_form` is the right place?

Yes, after `p.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')`, the name `Z` has value `Integer` in FriCAS.  By contrast, `x` still returns `x`, which is good.

So, for example, executing after that

```
sage: var("Z")
sage: fricas(Z^2+1)
```
will raise a strange error.
