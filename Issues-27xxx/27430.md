A more fundamental question: why not provide the `algorithm` keyword for matrices in general?

I admit, that I do not know how the matrix design currently works, but possibly `sage.matrix.matrix2.smith_form` is the right place?

....: sage: fricas.eval("Z")

Does this mean that there is a leak?

Yes, after `p.coxeter_smith_form(algorithm='fricas')`, the name `Z` has value `Integer` in FriCAS.  By contrast, `x` still returns `x`, which is good.

So, for example, executing after that

```
sage: var("Z")
sage: fricas(Z^2+1)
```
will raise a strange error.
