This is an idea for fixing #27373.

As explained in [comment:73:ticket:27373 comment#73] on that ticket, after installing a new package it is really necessary to re-run `configure` after installing a new package, whether it was an optional package that was not previously installed, or a standard package that was not previously installed (due to a configure-time check determining that it was not needed).

This is to ensure that files generated by `configure` reflect the new system configuration, in terms of what SPKGs are installed.

Further, it is advisable to re-run `make all-build` in case the `sage -i` installed packages whose dependents need to be rebuilt.

This also needs to ensure that if an SPKG is installed for some standard package, that we account for that when re-running `configure`: It must not try again to check the system for that dependency, and just reflect that the SPKG is installed.  For example, from #27373, if Sage is first built using GMP/MPIR from the system, then we run `sage -i mpir`, the system configuration must be updated to reflect that we are now using the mpir SPKG instead of GMP/MPIR from the system.  It's also necessary to rebuilt any of its dependent packages.

This branch mostly fixes the bug in #27373 for me.

As noted in the commit message this does not yet preserve arguments previously passed to `configure`.  I think we can fix that by running `./config.status --config` but I need to test that a bit more.
