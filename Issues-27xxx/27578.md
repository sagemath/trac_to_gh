After upgrading to Sphinx 1.8.5 in #26451, Sphinx's function `formatargspec` is deprecated, so we should not use anymore it in `src/sage_setup/docbuild/ext/sage_autodoc.py`.

The deprecation warning advises to replace the use of `sphinx.ext.autodoc.inspector.formatargspec`
by that of `sphinx.util.inspect.Signature`.

For ordinary Python functions, we may be able to change `formatargspec(my_func, *argspec)` to `Signature(my_func).format_args()`. I don't think this works with Cython functions, though.
