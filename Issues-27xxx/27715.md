Per reports like [this one](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46075/sage-notebook-crashes-immediately), it seems there is some condition (I am not sure yet what) such that on Windows trying to bind to port 8888 results in a permission error, on which the notebook crashes:


```
[I 17:51:21.659 NotebookApp] Using MathJax: nbextensions/mathjax/MathJax.js Traceback (most recent call last):

File "/opt/sagemath-8.6/local/lib/python2.7/socket.py", line 230, in meth return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)

socket.error: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted
```

The notebook already has some code to try other ports if the requested port fails:

```python
        for port in random_ports(self.port, self.port_retries+1):
            try:
                self.http_server.listen(port, self.ip)
            except socket.error as e:
                if e.errno == errno.EADDRINUSE:
                    self.log.info(_('The port %i is already in use, trying another port.') % port)
                    continue
                elif e.errno in (errno.EACCES, getattr(errno, 'WSAEACCES', errno.EACCES)):
                    self.log.warning(_("Permission to listen on port %i denied") % port)
                    continue
                else:
                    raise
```

However, in this case some reason users are getting `EPERM` instead of `EACCES` and that case is not handled in the above code.

I'm okay, in this case, with just patching the package in Sage, since the patch is only needed (in some cases) on Cygwin, so it won't be needed by most other downstream packagers, etc.

I will just note for the record that the issue *could* be worked around by monkey-patching, but this is probably easier in this case.
