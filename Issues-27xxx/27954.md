<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

Instead of using `__eq__`, what about using `_richcmp_`? Otherwise you will have to implement a `__ne__` method I believe.

I also have some recollection that Python3 will be better in terms of locality of variables, but maybe that is not true. To be safe (and make it easier to understand), I would change:

```diff
         if i is None:
-           for i in range(P.ngens()):
-               if not P.gen(i) in ideal:
+           for j in range(P.ngens()):
+               if not P.gen(j) in ideal:
+                   i = j
                    break
```

Beyond these minor things, looks good.
