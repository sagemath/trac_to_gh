Actually, the problem is this line: `(var, poly) = rootOf.items()[i]`. The result of `items()` is a view, which does not support indexing (in a way, think of it like an iterator). However, since your changes work and the code looks cleaner, positive review.

Yes, the error message and trace did show that.

General question: should I modify the ticket description once I know the root of the problem?  The downside is that the history how the bugfix developed is sometimes not as easy to understand anymore.
