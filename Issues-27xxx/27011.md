Univariate polynomial rings have associated function fields:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: Frac(R)
Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: Frac(R).function_field()
Rational function field in x over Rational Field
```

A similar construction should be possible for quotient rings, if they are fields:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<y> = K[]
sage: R.quo(y^5 - (x^3 + 2*x*y + 1/x)).function_field()
Function field in y defined by y^5 - 2*x*y + (-x^4 - 1)/x
```

This ticket adds a `function_field` method to `PolynomialQuotientRing_field`

It's a good idea to have such a method! But I think it would be more useful if conversions between the both realizations would work.
Unfortunately, this is not the case:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<y> = K[]
sage: L = R.quo(y^5 - (x^3 + 2*x*y + 1/x))
sage: F = L.function_field()
sage: F(L.an_element())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: cannot convert ybar/1 to an element of Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
sage: L(F.an_element())
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: y is not an element of the base field
```

It should not be difficult to improve this (for example via the `_convert_map_from_` method), since both maps can be obtained as ring homomorphisms:

```
sage: f = L.hom(F.gens())
sage: g = F.hom(L.gens())
sage: f(L.an_element())
y
sage: g(F.an_element())
ybar
sage: (f*g).is_one()
True
sage: (g*f).is_one()
True
```
