libgap's randomness is not freshly seeded at the Sage startup. For example, sampling random matrices over GF(p) always produces same results.

```
$ sage -c 'print GL(4, GF(2)).random_element()'
[0 1 1 1]
[1 1 1 1]
[1 0 1 0]
[1 1 1 0]
$ sage -c 'print GL(4, GF(2)).random_element()'
[0 1 1 1]
[1 1 1 1]
[1 0 1 0]
[1 1 1 0]
```

Whereas, for example, randint() in Sage is always fresh.

First, this is quite misleading, as it is not even immediately clear that GL uses GAP. Second, it was quite hard to find how to actually reseed that randomness. For example, GAP.set_seed(123) does not help. Instead, libgap.set_seed() does solve the issue. 

I guess this relates to the whole libgap's randomness, not only to the GL() groups.
