Since #27222 I get the following tiny failure on Cygwin:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx", line 1642, in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement._pow_

1 item had failures:

```

That is, it's just off in the representation of the last decimal place.  I wish I could explain exactly where the difference comes from, but I think for this test it should suffice to just add a tolerance flag.

`CDF` uses the system math library, which is known to be implementation-dependent (e.g. for the same number `x` the value of `log(x)` may be different on different systems).

Yes, that's what I figured.  I know for a fact the `log()` function in particular in newlib math has caused minor numerical differences before.

It's nice to know for sure that that's probably the case.

Trivial, but still needed for tests to pass.
