Since #27222 I get the following tiny failure on Cygwin:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/rings/complex_double.pyx", line 1642, in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement._pow_
Failed example:

Expected:
    4.329780281177467e-17 - 0.7071067811865476*I
Got:
    4.329780281177466e-17 - 0.7071067811865475*I
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  19 in sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement._pow_
    [331 tests, 1 failure, 2.42 s]
```

That is, it's just off in the representation of the last decimal place.  I wish I could explain exactly where the difference comes from, but I think for this test it should suffice to just add a tolerance flag.

Replying to [ticket:27461 embray]:
> I wish I could explain exactly where the difference comes from

`CDF` uses the system math library, which is known to be implementation-dependent (e.g. for the same number `x` the value of `log(x)` may be different on different systems).

<a id='comment:2'>Comment 2:</a>
Yes, that's what I figured.  I know for a fact the `log()` function in particular in newlib math has caused minor numerical differences before.

It's nice to know for sure that that's probably the case.
