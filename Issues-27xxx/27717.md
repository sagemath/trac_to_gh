As asked here:

    https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46275/typeerror-unable-to-coerce-to-a-real-number/

This works:

```

sage: contour_plot(abs(x+y),(x,-3.1,3.1),(y,-3.1,3.1))

```

but this does not:

```
sage: contour_plot(abs(x+y*i),(x,-3.1,3.1),(y,-3.1,3.1)) 
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a real number
