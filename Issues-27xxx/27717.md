As asked here:

    https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46275/typeerror-unable-to-coerce-to-a-real-number/

This works:

```

but this does not:

```

Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unable to coerce to a real number

`@`slabbe: what makes you doubt that it is not a duplicate? #8450 has more plot failure examples, the same reference to the ask question and an explanation of the failure.
