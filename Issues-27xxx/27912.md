The recent GAP `PackageManager` package makes it much much easier to install new GAP packages. It seems to work smoothly from within Sage (up to the caveat of #27911), with e.g.:

```
    sage: libgap.InstallPackage("Semigroups")
```

So this seems like a valuable low hanging fruit.

Of course, the user still needs to have compiler tools and write access to the Sage install; but there is only so much we can do.

[EDIM](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/edim.html) might be a good test, as it builds a GAP kernel module, and has not been worked on in the context of Sage yet (that is, unlike Semigroup)

You might also want to experiment with e.g. removing GRAPE from `gap_packages` and trying to install it via PackageManager.

Try things  on OSX and Cygwin, try not to pull your hair out in the process :-)
(perhaps we might want to spend ODK money on OSX and Windows hardware, so that we can have more boxes to run buildbots, try things on, etc)

I presume that the present GAP 4.10.1 tarball contains a rather old version of PackageManager - I'd really wait for a newer realese.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Thinking about it a bit more, here is my perspective. 

Things have gone much much better recently on the use of GAP package in Sage, which is great. Indeed, and that's unfortunate, there are still GAP packages that can't be installed in Sage's GAP due to different problems. But somehow, that's none of `PackageManager`'s business.

`PackageManager` is about automating the installation of GAP packages that can already be installed smoothly. As such, it's immediately useful for many packages. We should help our users by making it available.

Something I'd already been thinking of previously is that it would be handy to have an additional GAP_ROOT outside of `$SAGE_LOCAL` (which I'm trying as hard as possible to make more manageable) where user-installed packages can go.  Certainly `.gap` is a possibility or this, but it would be nice to have a place where additional user-installed packages can be made available 'globally' to a Sage installation, without actually putting them in `$SAGE_LOCAL` or at least not in `$SAGE_LOCAL/share/gap`.
