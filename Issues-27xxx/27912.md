The recent GAP `PackageManager` package makes it much much easier to install new GAP packages. It seems to work smoothly from within Sage (up to the caveat of #27911), with e.g.:

```
    sage: libgap.InstallPackage("Semigroups")
```

So this seems like a valuable low hanging fruit.

Of course, the user still needs to have compiler tools and write access to the Sage install; but there is only so much we can do.

[EDIM](https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/edim.html) might be a good test, as it builds a GAP kernel module, and has not been worked on in the context of Sage yet (that is, unlike Semigroup)

You might also want to experiment with e.g. removing GRAPE from `gap_packages` and trying to install it via PackageManager.

Try things  on OSX and Cygwin, try not to pull your hair out in the process :-)
(perhaps we might want to spend ODK money on OSX and Windows hardware, so that we can have more boxes to run buildbots, try things on, etc)

I presume that the present GAP 4.10.1 tarball contains a rather old version of PackageManager - I'd really wait for a newer realese.

It could be that EDIM needs a patch to be installable in Sage's GAP.

One may try adding it to the list of packages to be installed in gap_packages, and
see how it goes there.

Indeed; or that our current out-of-source installation procedure for GAP is missing to install some build artefacts. Eventually, this will all be resolved when GAP will provide a native "make install" feature, and the build system of all packages will be updated. I can't wait :-)

Thinking about it a bit more, here is my perspective. 

Things have gone much much better recently on the use of GAP package in Sage, which is great. Indeed, and that's unfortunate, there are still GAP packages that can't be installed in Sage's GAP due to different problems. But somehow, that's none of `PackageManager`'s business.

`PackageManager` is about automating the installation of GAP packages that can already be installed smoothly. As such, it's immediately useful for many packages. We should help our users by making it available.

When installing packages through this interface, do they go into `local/share/gap`, or into `.gap`, or somewhere else?

Something I'd already been thinking of previously is that it would be handy to have an additional GAP_ROOT outside of `$SAGE_LOCAL` (which I'm trying as hard as possible to make more manageable) where user-installed packages can go.

It currently goes by default to ~/.gap (so the analogue of --user in pip). It can be configured with any alternative directory (which should be in GAP's path to be relevant). After discussions with Michael, he will implement a shorthand for "the pkg directory of the current gap".
