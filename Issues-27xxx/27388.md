In recent versions of the gap package, the file `local/share/gap/pkg/ctbllib/tst/docxpl.tst` gets installed with permissions `-r--r--r--`, because these are its permissions in the tarball. This can cause problems when upgrading if that involves overwriting that file. So let's fix permissions in the installation process.

This should be fixed at the source, but regardless it's useful to go ahead and apply sensible permissions to files when we unpack tarballs.
