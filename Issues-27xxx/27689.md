Somehow all those methods should move to `CombinatorialPolyhedron` (#26887) eventually. However, this might take some time until it actually happens.

weather -> whether

`is_pyramid`

- I find the apex of the pyramid to be a more natural certificate (would also be consistend with `is_bipyramid`
- `##` -> `#`
- `Polyhedron(vertices=[[]]).is_pyramid` will yield `False`, as `incidence_matrix` is not what   one would expect in this case
- Delete empty line at the end of the docstring

We should do changes in `pyramid` as well:

-`pyramid` should not be defined for unbounded polyhedra, this will not yield the convex hull
(the convex hull is not even closed)
- Also `Polyhedron().pyramid()` does not work, but should yield the 0-dimensional polytope
- delete empty line at end of docstring
- `tow` -> `two`

At the moment I'm not sure whether the code for bipyramide and prism is correct. I have to think about it. There might be some weird counterexample in high dimensions.

I think one should do prism in the following way:

A polytope is a prism if we find facets F_1,F_2 with vertices x_1,...,x_n resp. y_1,...,y_n such that they are exactly all vertices (so far so good).

Also they can be labeled (as I indicated) such that for each other facet either x_i and y_i are contained in it or neither.

To find this labeling is a non-trivial combinatorial task, I would say.

Basically we want to know whether a bipartite graph has a perfect matching.

For the bipyramid we do the dual approach.

Actually, much easier.

The edges of the polytope, not contained in F_1 or F_2 provide such a matching (if the polytope is a prism).

Getting the edges is not fast at the moment, but it will be soon.

I changed the certificate of `is_pyramid` and fixed the typos.

I changed the status of the ticket to "needs work" until either I give an argument why the code for `is_bipyramid` and `is_prism` works (if it works) or implement another way.

The gale transform is pretty slow, I believe. Completing something to an orthonormal basis involves hard computations as far as I know (33s for the 5-dimensional permutahedron on my machine, 5s for the 9-dimensional cube).

This is what one should do for the bipyramid:

1. Let `a`,`b` the candidates for the apexes of a polytope `P`.
2. P is a bipyramid over `a` and `b`, if and only if the vertex figures are identical.

Hence we can take all facets incident to `a` in their vertex-representation and delete `a` from them. E.g. (v_1,v_2,v_3,a) -> (v_1,v_2,v_3).
Likewise we proceed for `b`.
If the two lists (of ridges of `P`) are identical, then this is a bipyramid over `a` and `b`, otherwise not.

This check should be arithmetically very fast (especially since there shouldn't be many candidates for `a` and `b`).

Does what I'm saying make any sense? Is this correct?

Likewise one could proceed with the prism, just with facet-incidences of vertices/edges.

All the Gale transform needs to do is to compute a basis for the kernel of the vertices matrix. This does not have high complexity. Then, to check if the polytope is pyramidal at a vertex `x`, one just checks if the corresponding dual vertex is the `0` vector.

This is `False`. Take a prism over a polygon, then stack the two polygons. The stacked vertices have identical vertex figures, but the polytope is obviously not a bipyramid.

Further, computing vertex figures are costly if not done properly. (Imagine creating one Polyhedron object for each vertex and then, what? Check isomorphism types?

Getting the kernel as above is not too hard, and uses significantly less memory than creating tons of objects for each vertex in the input.

There was a reason I said identical and not isomorphic. I should have said combinatorially identical (take all faces containing 'a' and delete 'a', this way one obtains the vertex figure of 'a', actually the facets suffice for checking).

We just need the facets as vertex-incidences. This is incredible cheap. Also there is no need to determine the combinatorial type, as we really check for equality.

Being a bipyramid involves more than combinatorics of adjacencies. Think about two centrally-symmetric vertices of the cube, everything you may come up with will give the same on both of them, nevertheless, the cube remains not a bipyramid. Cocircuits encodes bipyramid very conveniently and Gale transform gives you access to them. This is why I mentioned that it would be worth looking into it.

'is_pyramid' should be almost as fast as it gets. If there is a vertex adjacent to all but one facet, it's a pyramid. Doing Gale transform is much slower, as we already have vertex-facet-incidences cached.

Think about two centrally-symmetric vertices of the cube, everything you may come up with will give the same on both of them, nevertheless, the cube remains not a bipyramid. Cocircuits encodes bipyramid very conveniently and Gale transform gives you access to them. This is why I mentioned that it would be worth looking into it.

This is not a counterexample to my approach. The vertex figures are just not identical. They are isomorphic, but not identical. One might have to require that each facet is adjacent to 'a' or 'b'.

This approach proves that the polytope is combinatorially equivalent to the bipyramid over the vertex figure of 'a'. Then it is a bipyramid.
This is as much detail as I'm willing to provide now. I can give more detail on Monday.

Gale transform (or its implementation) is much slower than incidence matrix at the moment.

I'm thinking about starting my own branch on top of this one and implementing `is_bipyramid` and `is_prism` along with a proof in one docstring. Any thoughts?

Here are a few suggestions to fix:

```diff
    def is_pyramid(self, certificate=False):
        """
        Test whether the polytope is a pyramid over one of its facets.

        INPUT:

+        - ``certificate`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); specifies whether
+          to return a vertex of the polytope which is the apex of a pyramid,
+          if found.
-        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) boolean; specifies whether
-          to return a vertex of the polytope which is the apex of a pyramid,
-          if found
```

In the `OUTPUT`, I would indent the enumeration (not sure if this is needed, I did not check the compiled documentation), and leave out the enumeration for the second case.

The `NotImplementedError` would be better with a `ValueError("the polyhedron is not compact")`

I would try to avoid using `I` in the code not to overload the complex number `I`...

This sentence seems to miss a word:

```
+            # Remove equations from incidence matrix,
+            # such this is the vertex-facet-incidences matrix.
```

Otherwise, looks good!

Actually, for pyramid and bipyramid we should just return false, if not compact.
No unbounded polyhedron is ever a pyramid or bipyramid.

As for prism, I think `NotImplementedError` is correct.
The notion of a prism over an unbounded polyhedron makes sense and one could extend this method in a follow up.
(The rays are a bit annoying, otherwise it's the same.)

That's another option, but I thought that to return an error is more likely to be informative than a `False`. This makes it evident that being a pyramid and bipyramid is a compact property and not defined for unbounded polyhedron. Returning `False` means that the realm where the property exists includes the unbounded polyhedra.

That said, it is hairsplitting. I do not mind really. The only argument is that returning an error is more likely to flag errors in code rather than return False and continue in the code. For example, this may be used in try statements to detect unboundedness (ok, far-fetched...)

That's true...

I think a `ValueError` would be better than just `False`. Since it is not a property of the unbounded polyhedron then it should raise an error, for the same argument jipilab gave.

> As for prism, I think `NotImplementedError` is correct.
> The notion of a prism over an unbounded polyhedron makes sense and one could extend this method in a follow up.

Also agree.

I will fix these issues as suggested.

I ran

That's strange. You can try `--verbose` to see if it gets tested.
Sounds to me, as if you forgot to build after updating the code.

A few small things:

- "polyhedron has to be compact." I would not put a period at the end of the error message.

- instead of two nested for loops with if statements, couldn't `vertices` directly be filtered and only contain the relevant ones? I would try to reduce this and try to avoid using the ifs in for loops.

- then, I would import `combinations` from `itertools` and use `combinations(vertices,2)`. This will gain some speed and be prettier.

The last two comments can be use for `is_bipyramid` and `is_prism`.

It is prettier, but it is not faster, as we discussed in person. The efficiency looks very close here if I use `combinations` or just two `for` loops.

Well, it is **slower**? If it is as fast, it is shorter, so slightly preferable. In any case, it's not that important.

- I would apply a filter in the function `is_pyramid` for the `facets` and rename it `potential_facets`, it makes the code closer to reality... Because, why create a list with `n_facets` entries when you actually do not need them at all...

- Try to name the variables in `is_bipyramid` is a way that makes the code readable: `n` and `m` are very generic. I would use `nb_verts` and `nb_facets` for example. `facets` should be called `facets_incidence`. Same with `vertices` it is not a dictionary of vertices, but a dictionary giving the incidence of potential apexes.

- The code below is hard to read because of that. `a` is an index, so it could be called `index1`. I would try to make the code as readable as possible by naming the object as consistent as possible... Especially since there is such an object called `Vertex`, it may lead to confusion.

```diff
+        for a in range(len(valid_vertices)):
+            i = valid_vertices[a]
+            vertex1 = vertices[i]
+            for b in range(a+1, len(valid_vertices)):
+                j = valid_vertices[b]
+                vertex2 = vertices[j]
```

- Inline comments do not need to be typeset like in latex. (That's not so important... But you do not need to go to such extend...)

- The same is true about readability of `is_prism`...

No. I disagree. It is not "just because" it is a combinatorial property that we should pollute the name space. The functions in this ticket are obviously combinatorial ones (where could a confusion come from? and imagine how complicated a geometric verification of this could be...), whereas the method in #28256 has an obvious possibility to be mistaken for the geometric polar dual.

Let's not overdo things and be more catholic than the pope...

The geometric verification is really easy. For the prism you just check, that the pairs of vertices all differ by a common vector.
For the bipyramid you check that all vertices but the two apices lie on a common hyperplane.

I'm confused. I find the distinction between prism and only combinatorially equivalent to prism very natural.
Just like the distinction between two polytopes being exactly polar to each other or just up to combinatorially equivalence.

I don't see why the second thing is more natural than the first one.

No. The realization space of prism is more complicated.

This way to verify bipyramid is so artificial that I can not imagine a usage. Anyhow, it is not the point of the current ticket. Of course, if you feel like this is an absolute necessity, then you may create a follow-up ticket.

The distinction is clear. The ticket is about combinatorial check. Let's just limit this ticket on this, please.

Ok.

Replying to [@jplab](#comment%3A43):
> Well, it is slower? If it is as fast, it is shorter, so slightly preferable. In any case, it's not that important. 

Using two `for` loops is (very) slightly faster than using `combinations`, and that is why I chose the two `for` loops. I guess since `combinations` makes the code prettier and more readable, you are right, it is preferable. gh-kliem can look at the commit "e41a64f" to see the code using `combinations` if he would like to.

The functions in this ticket are obviously combinatorial ones (where could a confusion come from? and imagine how complicated a geometric verification of this could be...), whereas the method in #28256 has an obvious possibility to be mistaken for the geometric polar dual.

A confusion could arise if the user thought that `P.is_bipyramid() == True` means that we can construct (the geometric polytope) `P` as a bipyramid over some polytope on the vertices of `P`, which is not the case here. A typical example, shown below, is if you start with the regular octahedron and perturbed one of its vertices such that you still have an octahedron. Then `P.is_bipyramid` gives `True`. However, you can not construct `P` as a bipyramid using the given certificate.

```
sage: V = [[1, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [1/2, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 0, -1]]
sage: P = Polyhedron(V)
sage: P.is_combinatorially_isomorphic(polytopes.octahedron())
True
sage: P.is_bipyramid(certificate=True)
(True, [A vertex at (-1, 0, 0), A vertex at (1, 0, 0)])
sage: Q = Polyhedron([V[i] for i in [2,3,4,5]]); Q
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
```
This confusion could be dealt with if the user read the documentation of the method which says 
> Test whether the polytope is combinatorially equivalent to a bipyramid over some polytope.

In all, I think here it should be `is_combinatorially_bipyramid` and `is_combinatorially_prism`, if we want to remove the confusion.
