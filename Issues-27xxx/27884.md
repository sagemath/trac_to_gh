If E is an elliptic curve defined over a field K and L/K is a quadratic extension then there is an elliptic curve E'/K isomorphic to E over L but not over K, called the quadratic twist of E by L/K.  In case L=K(sqrt(d)) for some non-square d in K, this is also called the quadratic twist of E by d; this is always the case except in characteristic 2.  When the characteristic is not 2 or 3 and E has short Weierstrass equation Y<sup>2=X</sup>3+aX+b then *usually* the twist by d is obtained by replacing (a,b) by (a*d<sup>2,b*d</sup>3), **but** there is one case for which this is incorrect, namely when d=-1 and b=0.  In this case, the twist takes (a,0) to (-4*a,0).  We do not implement this properly:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,1,0]); E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Rational Field
sage: E.quadratic_twist(-1)
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Rational Field
```

For the record, Magma gives the same result as Sage in the preceding example, which (in my opinion) means that both have a bug.  I will seek more opinions.  Meanwhile, continuing the example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,0,1,0]); E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Rational Field
sage: K.<i> = QuadraticField(-1)
sage: E.change_ring(K).descend_to(QQ)
[Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x over Rational Field,
 Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 - 4*x over Rational Field]
```
This means that the last two curves (being the original and one other) are non-isomorphic over Q but isomorphic over K=Q(i), which according tm me means that the second curve listed is *the* quadratic twist of E by -1.  But then I wrote the descend_to method.

I have discussed this with several experts, who agree.  So nothing needs changing.

This should be set to invalid/don't-fix.
