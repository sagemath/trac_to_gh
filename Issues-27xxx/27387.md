Before this ticket, `TypeError` in the saturation of this
elliptic curve over a number field:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-26)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a, 1-a, 0, 93-16*a, 3150-560*a])
sage: P = E([65-35*a/3, (959*a-5377)/9])
sage: E.saturation([P], one_prime=2)
...
TypeError: Coordinates [1, 1, 1] do not define a point on
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 + 1 over
Residue field of Fractional ideal (2, a)
```

After this ticket, the saturation is computed and returned correctly:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-26)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a, 1-a, 0, 93-16*a, 3150-560*a])
sage: P = E([65-35*a/3, (959*a-5377)/9])
sage: E.saturation([P], one_prime=2)
([(-1/4*a + 3/4 : 59/8*a - 317/8 : 1)], 2, 0.344624259712631)
```

This is curve http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/2.2.105.1/5.1/a/1

Keywords: **elliptic curves, saturation**

In the example E has a 2-torsion point T and P+T can be halved so the saturation is not trivial:

```
P.division_points(2)
[]
T = E.torsion_points()[0]
(P+T).division_points(2)
[(-1/4*a + 3/4 : 59/8*a - 317/8 : 1), (-2*a + 11 : -19*a + 107 : 1)]

The problem is caused by the following:

Let K be a number field, E an elliptic curve over K, and Q a prime of K where E has good reduction.  Let P be a point in E(K) which has good reduction at Q, meaning that the affine coordinates of P are integral at Q.  Then Sage allows us to compute EmodQ = E.reduction(Q) and then one thinks that EmodQ(P) will be the image of P on the reduced curve, but it might not be!  In general, and certainly if the model of E is not minimal at Q, then EmodQ is formed by taking the local minimal model of E at Q and then reducing that.  Then, there is no reason why the reduced coordinates of P will satisfy the reduced equation.

For the curve in question there is no global minimal model, and the model is non-minimal at the prime Q=(2,a) above 2.  The saturation code excludes primes where E has good reduction in the proper mathematical sense, but it should also exclude primes where the model is non-minimal.

So a fix is to replace line 288 of saturation.py.  In progress.

I think you mean bad reduction here.

I think the fix is correct besides the indentation of doctests. When I tried to fixed the indentation myself, the html output I get becomes very wrong so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.
