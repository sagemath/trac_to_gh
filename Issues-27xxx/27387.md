Before this ticket, `TypeError` in the saturation of this
elliptic curve over a number field:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-26)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a, 1-a, 0, 93-16*a, 3150-560*a])
sage: P = E([65-35*a/3, (959*a-5377)/9])
sage: E.saturation([P], one_prime=2)
...
TypeError: Coordinates [1, 1, 1] do not define a point on
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + y = x^3 + 1 over
Residue field of Fractional ideal (2, a)
```

After this ticket, the saturation is computed and returned correctly:

```
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-26)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([a, 1-a, 0, 93-16*a, 3150-560*a])
sage: P = E([65-35*a/3, (959*a-5377)/9])
sage: E.saturation([P], one_prime=2)
([(-1/4*a + 3/4 : 59/8*a - 317/8 : 1)], 2, 0.344624259712631)
```

This is curve http://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/2.2.105.1/5.1/a/1

Keywords: **saturation**

In the example E has a 2-torsion point T and P+T can be halved so the saturation is not trivial:

```
P.division_points(2)

T = E.torsion_points()[0]
(P+T).division_points(2)

I think you mean bad reduction here.

I think the fix is correct besides the indentation of doctests. When I tried to fixed the indentation myself, the html output I get becomes very wrong so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.

Thanks for the review.  You are right that I wrote "good" when I meant "bad".

I have fixed the indentation issue in ell_number_field.py

klui: please add your full name in the Reviewers field.
