When a parameter default value is a dictionary, it is stored in the function definition, and any modification of this dictionary is acting on (changing) this stored default. So the next call of the function will use the modified default. Which is not the expected effect.

I was not aware of that, but it makes sense that things were designed that way. That sure can lead to subtle bugs.

```
sage: def foo(x, d={}):
....:     d[x] = 1
....:     return d
....: 
sage: x = foo(5)
sage: x
{5: 1}
sage: x[10] = 10
sage: foo(0)
{0: 1, 5: 1, 10: 10}
```

However, in these cases the `dict` is only expanded and never changed. So I don't see the point of making the code more complex to silence a warning:

```
sage: def bar(**opts):
....:     opts[1] = 5
....:     
sage: def foo(d={}):
....:     bar(**d)
....:     return d
....: 
sage: foo()
{}
sage: foo()
{}
```
