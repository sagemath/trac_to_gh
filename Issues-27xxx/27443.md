I was not aware of that, but it makes sense that things were designed that way. That sure can lead to subtle bugs.

```
sage: def foo(x, d={}):
....:     d[x] = 1
....:     return d
....: 
sage: x = foo(5)
sage: x
{5: 1}
sage: x[10] = 10
sage: foo(0)
{0: 1, 5: 1, 10: 10}
```

However, in these cases the `dict` is only expanded and never changed. So I don't see the point of making the code more complex to silence a warning:

```
sage: def bar(**opts):
....:     opts[1] = 5
....:     
sage: def foo(d={}):
....:     bar(**d)
....:     return d
....: 
sage: foo()
{}
sage: foo()
{}
```
