The file tests/cmdline.py fails a few doctests with Python 3 because it relies on the scripts `sage-rst2sws` and `sage-rst2txt`, which in turn use `sagenb`. Since `sagenb` is not Python 3 compatible, the tests fail.

The script `sage-rst2txt` is only incompatible in the sense that it raises a deprecation warning, and so we can ignore that. Trying to run `sage-rst2sws` produces a genuine error, from this line in `sagenb.notebook.smtpsend`:

```
from twisted.mail import smtp, relaymanager  # problematic with python 3
```
So ignore the error for `sage-rst2txt` with Python 3, and don't run the tests for `sage-rst2sws` at all with Python 3.

looks good

maybe we can use the opportunity to fix the pyflakes warnings in the modified file, using

```
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
```
