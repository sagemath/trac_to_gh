While working on `complex_double.pyx`, I noticed that a lot of code was using `.dat[0]` and `.dat[1]` to access the real and imaginary parts of a `gsl_complex`. Instead, we allow the more Pythonic `.real` and `.imag`.

This is just refactoring some Cython code, it doesn't affect any public interface or behavior at all.
