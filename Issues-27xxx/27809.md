- The given link to ActiveState is still valid, but the recipes have moved to github: https://github.com/ActiveState/code

  The current location for recipe 366178 is https://github.com/ActiveState/code/tree/master/recipes/Python/366178_fast_prime_number_list


- in `random_prime`, the latex math mode is not actived (`"""` instead of `r"""`) yet we have <code>\`lbound <= p <= n\`</code>. Furthermore, `<=` could be `\leq`.

- in the description of method `gcd`, variables a and b could be in math mode

- in the description of methods `power_mod`, `prime_to_m_part` and `is_square`, n and m could be <code>\`\`n\`\`</code> or <code>\`n\`</code>. For instance in `Return whether or not n is square, and if n is a square also`

- in `jacobi_symbol`

```diff
-    if b % 2==0:
+    if b % 2 == 0:
```

- in `random_prime`:

```diff
-    - ``lbound`` - an integer >= 2, lower bound for the chosen primes
+    - ``lbound`` -- an integer >= 2, lower bound for the chosen primes
```

- At the beginning of `next_prime`,  `previous_prime`, `class Moebius`, we still have some `n` instead of <code>\`\`n\`\`</code>

- you could change in all methods to `r"""` as some methods use latex but start only with `"""` like `hilbert_symbol`, `three_squares`, `sum_of_k_squares`, `differences`
