Running SageTeX with Python 2 on this file fails:

```
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{sagetex}
\begin{document}

\begin{sageblock}
  s = "hello á goodbye"
\end{sageblock}

\end{document}
```
(With Python 3, I think it works.) The error occurs when running Sage:

```
$ sage junk.sagetex.sage
Processing Sage code for junk.tex...
Code block (line 5) begin...end
Traceback (most recent call last):

The problem is with the use of the `bytearray` function. With Python 2:

```
>>> bytearray('á')
bytearray(b'\xc3\xa1')
>>> bytearray('á', 'utf8')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
```
With Python 3:

```
>>> bytearray('á')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: string argument without an encoding
>>> bytearray('á', 'utf8')
bytearray(b'\xc3\xa1')
```
