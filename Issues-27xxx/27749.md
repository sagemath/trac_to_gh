Q = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 2, [2,3,5])
P = QuadraticForm(ZZ, 2, [8,6,5])
Q.is_globally_equivalent_to(P)
True
P.is_globally_equivalent_to(Q)

The expected output in any case is `False`. 
The underlying computation is done with Pari.

This is still failing in pari 2.11.2 from May 2019 (currently in sage)

but works in pari [2, 11, 4, 23175, "e4f812ce9f"].

This will need a doctest once pari is updated.
