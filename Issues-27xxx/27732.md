This is again because `RecursivelyEnumeratedSet` gives different output order on the different Python versions. `:/` It will work for those 9 elements since it iterates by length of the elements. Perhaps the better test(s) is

```
sage: X = S.some_elements()
sage: len(X)
10
sage: all(x in S for x in X)
True
