This looks similar to what had to be fixed for polymake 3.4 in #24905.

```
sage: p = polymake.rand_sphere(3,20)
sage: g = p.GRAPH
sage: g
Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational::_prop_GRAPH=ARRAY(0x7fafdafa8308)
sage: g.N_NODES
Member function 'N_NODES' of Polymake::polytope::Polytope__Rational::_prop_GRAPH object  ### should have given: 20
sage: g.N_NODES()
20
```

Other affected properties: `BOUNDED_VERTICES`, `VISUAL`, `LATTICE_POINTS`, ...

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
