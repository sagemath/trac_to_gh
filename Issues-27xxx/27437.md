It shouldn't install the docs unless `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS=yes` explicitly, rather than explicitly checking `SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS != no`.

It should also ensure that sphinx is installed, which is necessary for the doc build.

It occurs to me now that this is partially a duplicate of #27403, but I still think it's a problem (unless I'm mistaken) that it's building the docs unnecessarily.

It has been done on purpose. Given pplpy is a standard package and that there is intersphinx links between sage documentation and pplpy's documentation, we prefer that pplpy's documentation is installed in the default case (When SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS is undefined).

Alright. I'm not really sure how I feel about that: I don't see why not just do like with other packages and host its documentation online, and download the inventories for intersphinx builds.  This is what's done on most projects--I don't know why Sage is trying to be weird about this.

But given that, for now, this was intentional and #27403 has the dependency fix, I'll close as duplicate.
