Original suggestion was:
1. Have a simple `ring*` wrapper which replaces the two wrappers in `sage.libs.singular` and which is a base class for the two wrappers in `sage.rings.polynomial`.
2. Have all basic libsingular wrappers in a new module `sage.libs.singular.wrappers`.
3. Add more wrappers, in particular for ideals, so that `MPolynomialIdeal_singular_repr` can inherit from it. On a different ticket, it shall also be used to have `MPolynomailIdeal_nc_singular_repr` for ideals over non-commutative polynomial rings.

Second thought: It would be too ambitious, as it would mean to create a separate wrapper for each and every libsingular struct. Modified suggestion:
1. Leave existing code as it is.
2. Add only a wrapper for `leftv*`. This would be a thin wrapper around Singular objects and would be a natural input type for a singular_function.
3. The wrapper would have a `.sage()` method, which in most cases should be able to construct a Sage object corresponding to the wrapped Singular object.

The above would, I think, be fairly close to what libgap does.

Potential problems come from multiple inheritance. I think Ring should stay a cdef class, perhaps CommutativeRing as well, and RingWrap has to stay cdef for sure. So, !MPolynomialRing_libsingular cannot simultaneously inherit from both CommutativeRing and RingWrap, with the current class layout of the latter two.

But it would make sense to let RingWrap inherit from Ring. After all, libsingular's `ring*` is for rings! Perhaps, for efficiency, one wouldn't always call `Ring.__init__(...)`, for instance if one really just need the RingWrap and no fancy stuff from categories.

In addition, one could move all cdef attributes of CommutativeRing to Ring. In that way, !MPolynomialRing_libsingular could in future be a Python class inheriting both from RingWrap and from CommutativeRing (there would be no layout conflict).

And the same would be done for the non-commutative versions of libsingular rings.

So, that's what I will try, provided I find time in spite of teaching...

Many data types in Singular are ring dependent. Unfortunately, a Singular object doesn't seem to know which ring it belongs to, and the user needs to keep track of the ring and change into it before working with the corresponding object. Also, if that ring is killed, the contained objects are killed as well, even if the user kept a reference to them.

So, I am currently thinking that the `leftv*` wrapper should also have a pointer to a ring (it may be NULL for those types that are ring independent), increasing the ring refcount, thus preventing it from being collected.

I am really unhappy with how the ring ref count currently is done: It is via a dictionary in which ring wrappers are stored. Why not use the `ref` field of the struct `ring`? After all, that field was designed to keep track of the number of references to a ring!

In other words, I also think that #13447 should be revived. I will see if I can finally fix #13447. If I can, it should be a dependency for this ticket.
