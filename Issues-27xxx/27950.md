As reported by "dantetante"
[on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/ltKpky7yeyY/discussion),
the [SageMath installation guide for conda](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/conda.html)
currently suggests

```
source activate sage
```
but this should be changed to

```
conda activate sage
```

For reference, this changed with the release of Conda 4.4.0, see the release notes:

- https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/release-notes.html

It seems to be a matter of letting conda tweak one's PATH vs not.

Running the following works for me (I installed Miniconda in `/opt`):

```
$ /opt/miniconda3/bin/mamba create -n sage sage -c conda-forge
```

Besides that: maybe add some actual date instead of `|today|` in:

```
At the time of this edit (|today|)
```

it seems that your setup is non-standard (wrong `conda` is called ?). What I see that `conda` and `mamba` are installed into the same directory, and so whenever you have one in PATH, you have the other, too.
