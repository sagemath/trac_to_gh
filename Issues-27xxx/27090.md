Currently, `cpdef` methods in Cython are faster for extension classes than for Python classes.

This ticket defines a new function (usable as class decorator) which turns a Python class into an extension class.

There is one caveat: extension classes are not reference counted and cannot be deallocated. So this can lead to memory leaks if used badly.

Depends on #27099

I am curious whether I can be a user of this `@extension_class` decorator.

If I have a python class based on cython classes in sage library that I want to speed things up for its objects,  then could I add the decorator to the class for my purpose? If so, what would be possible disadvantages in doing it that you warn me on?

A sage developer without much knowledge about cython, like me, might be tempted to put the decorator to any class, without fully understanding its implications. More documentation for him or her may be added.
