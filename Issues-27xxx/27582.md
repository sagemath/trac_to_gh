```
With #27501, we introduced an error in `all_paths` for Python 3. Indeed, `my_dict.keys()` returns a list in Python 2 but it is an iterator in Python 3, so the following code breaks as the size of the dictionary change during iteration.

```
                for u, v in my_dict.keys():
                    my_dict[v, u] = my_dict[u, v]
```

We fix this issue using `list(my_dict.keys())`. On the way, we also rename `my_dict` to `edge_labels`.
