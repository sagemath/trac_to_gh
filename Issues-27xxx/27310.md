This ticket improves the translation of formal derivatives evaluated at a point, for example:

```
sage: f = function("F")
sage: var("y")
y
sage: ex = (diff(f(x,y), x, x, y)).subs(y=x+y); ex
D[0, 0, 1](F)(x, x + y)
sage: fricas(ex)
F      (x,y + x)
 ,1,1,2
sage: fricas(ex).sage()
D[0, 0, 1](F)(x, x + y)
```

Note that this ticket requires a fix in FriCAS itself, which will probably be in FriCAS 1.3.6.
