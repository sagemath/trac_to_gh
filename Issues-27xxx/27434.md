A few month ago a set up an experimental [buildbot worker for Cygwin](http://build.sagemath.org/#/workers/2) so that we can hopefully have consistent and regular Cygwin builds.  (I used to have a Cygwin patchbot too but it's been mysteriously down for a while; I need to check on that).

The buildbot has had a few problems getting off the ground though.  The biggest blocker, I think, is that it hangs during building the reference docs, *specifically* the manifolds docs (which are the first it tries to build).

If I modify the docbuilder code to run the docbuild serially (i.e. replace `multiprocessing.map_async` with plain `map()`) the docbuild completes successfully.  

It turns out it's not just the docbuild.  When running the `sage.manifolds` tests like

```
./sage -t --long -p 4 src/sage/manifolds/
```

a few of the test modules succeed, but eventually all of the works grind to a complete halt and get stuck.

I would suspect a problem like #27213, but I have built OpenBLAS on that system with the fix for that issue.  So it's *probably* something else.

I don't observe this problem on any other system--just the one I happened to set up as the buildbot.  It could also happen to be a bug in the Cygwin on that machine.

I'm just opening this ticket as a reminder to myself to investigate further.

One reason to suspect Cygwin is that the processes that get stuck are *really* stuck and unkillable through Cygwin.  They no longer respond to signals including SIGKILL.  Though this can also happen sometimes in multithreading deadlocks.

I tried running just

```
./sage -t --long --verbose src/sage/manifolds/point.py
```

and it got stuck at

```
Trying (line 767):    g + gX # display of the point atop the coordinate grid
Expecting:
    Graphics object consisting of 20 graphics primitives
```

Then I tried 

```
./sage -t --long --verbose src/sage/manifolds/chart.py
```

and it got stuck at 

```
Trying (line 2233):    g
Expecting:
    Graphics object consisting of 18 graphics primitives
```

If I run each test with `--serial` it passes.  So there's definitely a problem with fork.  The fact that it's happen during displaying graphics also leads me again to suspect OpenBLAS but we'll see.

The fix in #27438 definitely fixes the more pervasive bug that is simply caused when OpenBLAS doesn't clean up its thread pool prior to forking.

However, with that issue fixed, there is another more subtle and I think non-deterministic issue that can crop up. It only shows up in the docbuild, specifically the plot3d docs, just because it gives the most opportunities for the problem to occur within a single process: almost each plot it creates involves at some point calling numpy.inv which ends up invoking an multithreaded BLAS routine.

This can be closed.  I haven't had an particular docbuild issues on Cygwin in a while, related to OpenBLAS or otherwise.  Also the new doctest forker code that has since been added is more robust against hangs.

The buildbot this references hasn't been running in some time either.
