The proposed patch fixes some doctests, but I also see this error.

It's not clear to me why the old code wouldn't work on Python 3.  In any case this is an ugly way to write `min(...)` so I would rather just skip this test if for some reason it doesn't work as a 1-liner.

Please in the future CC me on changes to these tests.
