This is a small patch to add a parameter `closed` to the `.neighborhood_iterator` method of graphs, in order to generate the closed neighborhood of a vertex (i.e. the vertex + its neighborhood).

It was part of #27424; as suggested in a comment I made a separate ticket for it.

**Keywords:** closed neighborhood

in list of bullets, when a bullet has several lines, the second line must be shifted by 2 spaces. Otherwise, the documentation will not build properly.

```diff
-        - ``closed`` -- a boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
-        return the closed neighborhood of ``vertex``, i.e., including
-        ``vertex``, or the open neighborhood in which ``vertex``
-        is included only if there is a loop on that vertex.
+        - ``closed`` -- a boolean (default: ``False``); whether to
+          return the closed neighborhood of ``vertex``, i.e., including
+          ``vertex``, or the open neighborhood in which ``vertex``
+          is included only if there is a loop on that vertex.
```

you can do `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html` to rebuild only the documentation of the graph module, and then look at the produced html page in your web browser. If it's not looking good, then you must improve something.
