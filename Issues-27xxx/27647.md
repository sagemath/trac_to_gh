This is a small patch to add a parameter `closed` to the `.neighborhood_iterator` method of graphs, in order to generate the closed neighborhood of a vertex (i.e. the vertex + its neighborhood).

It was part of #27424; as suggested in a comment I made a separate ticket for it.

Keywords: closed neighborhood
