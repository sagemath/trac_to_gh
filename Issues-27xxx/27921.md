Apparently some Linux systems don't come with libxml2 installed, which is a polymake prerequisite.

```
mkoeppe.sphere$ make polymake
...
[polymake-3.4] checking libxml2 installation ... Could not find configuration program xml2-config for library libxml2.
[polymake-3.4] Probably you need to install development package for it;
[polymake-3.4] usually it is called libxml2-devel or similarly.
[polymake-3.4] If the library is installed at a non-standard location,
[polymake-3.4] please specify it in option --with-libxml2
```

We add `spkg-configure` and system package information

I appreciate your efforts with spkg-configure.m4; but I don't support adding more prerequisites to Sage. Sage-the-distribution works well for installing lots of math software on poorly maintained university computers. My goal in this ticket is to bring the polymake package to the same standard - make it as easy to install as other sage packages.

Replying to [@mkoeppe](#comment%3A3):

To clarify, I don't support depending on more packages to exist in the system for a Sage installation to succeed.

a library should only be vendored if on a system supported by Sage it is either not available, or broken. Otherwise it is a bloat that is killing the project, rather than improving it.

there are already other optional packages, e.g. igraph, in Sage that require libxml2.

there is also R package xml2, which uses libxml2, and which some people install --- and which this ticket potentially breaks.

this is yet another reason why I don't like vendoring standard libraries - because you end up spending all your time chasing up stuff like this, and it ends up like iconv package, which is still there, but we don't install it on anything but (maybe) cygwin, or (broken platform) solaris.

Lots of good points. Turns out on the system where I was trying to compile polymake, also `perl-devel` and `Term::ReadKey` are missing.

I installed libxml2 with homebrew and tried this ticket (.bootstrap, source .hombrew-build-env, ./configure, make build) on macOS 10.15.7. Compilation went well, libxml2 was detected and used.

I don't know what else I can do to test this ticket.
