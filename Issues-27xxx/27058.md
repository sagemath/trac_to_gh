Have been using it in sage-on-gentoo since 17/12/2018 and I have done quite a few builds and doctests runs with that. So I think it is OK :) 

Positive review from me when you are ready.

According to the release notes for Numpy 1.16 it requires just `Cython>=0.29`.  I'm not sure where the "0.29.2" claim is coming from, though it's possible that it fixes some bugs that affect either Numpy or Sage.

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
Don't worry about it. It's not really important whether it requires Cython-0.29 or Cython-0.29.2. I was just asking for curiosity.

It's not a bad idea to upgrade Cython anyway, since it is supposed to fix a memory leak.
