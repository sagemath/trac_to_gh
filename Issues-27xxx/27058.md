Have been using it in sage-on-gentoo since 17/12/2018 and I have done quite a few builds and doctests runs with that. So I think it is OK :) 

Positive review from me when you are ready.

According to the release notes for Numpy 1.16 it requires just `Cython>=0.29`.  I'm not sure where the "0.29.2" claim is coming from, though it's possible that it fixes some bugs that affect either Numpy or Sage.

Don't worry about it. It's not really important whether it requires Cython-0.29 or Cython-0.29.2. I was just asking for curiosity.

It's not a bad idea to upgrade Cython anyway, since it is supposed to fix a memory leak.
