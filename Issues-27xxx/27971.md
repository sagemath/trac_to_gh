The Python 3 doctest failures in `sage/misc/sageinspect.py` and `sage/misc/sagedoc.py` all arise because of the second line here (from `sageinspect.py`):

```
        spec = sage_getargspec(obj)
        s = str(inspect.formatargspec(*spec))
```
The problem is that `inspect.formatargspec` is deprecated in Python 3.5, so it prints warning messages. From Sage's point of view, this is annoying, because there is no direct replacement (as far as I can tell) for `inspect.formatargspec`. The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.formatargspec) says to use `signature` and `Signature`, but we have already obtained the signature information using `sage_getargspec` and just want to format it. Also, `inspect.signature` doesn't seem to work on Cython functions â€” see cython [issue 1864](https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1864), or for a Sage-specific example:

```
sage: import inspect
sage: from sage.misc.sageinspect import sage_getargspec
sage: from sage.rings.integer import int_to_Z
sage: sage_getargspec(int_to_Z)
ArgSpec(args=['self', 'x'], varargs='args', keywords='kwds', defaults=None)
```
At this point, with Python 2:

```
sage: inspect.getargspec(long_to_Z)
...
TypeError: <type 'sage.rings.integer.long_to_Z'> is not a Python function
```
With Python 3:

```
sage: inspect.signature(int_to_Z)
...
ValueError: no signature found for builtin type <class 'sage.rings.integer.int_to_Z'>
```

Fixing this may also fix #27578.

As sage has it's own `getargspec` i think reimplementing `formatargspec` may be the best solution for now. That way sage would not be affected when `inspect.formatargspec` will be removed.

Note: `sage_getargspec` use `inspect.ArgSpec` and i wonder if this class will  be removed along with `inspect.formatargspec` and `inspect.getargspec`. 

Maybe we should define our own `ArgSpec` too.

I don't see anything indicating that `ArgSpec` will be removed. In `inspect.py`, it is defined by a one-liner:

```
ArgSpec = namedtuple('ArgSpec', 'args varargs keywords defaults')

(well, two lines if you count `from collections import namedtuple`). So it's trivial for us to implement if we need to.

Or we could switch to using `FullArgSpec`, defined in `inspect.py` by

```
FullArgSpec = namedtuple('FullArgSpec',
