I don't seem to have a problem with digraphs, it installs just fine, and uses a static copy of bliss, it seems.

This: https://github.com/gap-packages/Digraphs/pull/207

Any version of Digraphs we include in Sage should have this patch, and should be built with `--with-external-planarity` (as such, libplanarity then needs to be a dependency of gap_packages, assuming it isn't already).

Does this imply that this ticket is (abot) broken, as it adds Digraphs in an "old" way?
How does one test?

Note that https://github.com/gap-packages/Digraphs/pull/207 isn't even in a released version of Digraphs.

Probably. Digraphs adds planarity as a subdirectory just like semigroups does with libsemigroups and therefore planarity inside digraphs is not installed.

You're right that `Digraphs` pick up Sage's libplanarity.so:

```
$ ldd local/lib/gap/pkg/digraphs-0.15.2/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-default64-kv3/digraphs.so
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff9bdb7000)

	libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.1.0/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f55c3200000)
	libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f55c30c3000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f55c2ef3000)
	libgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.1.0/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f55c2ed9000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f55c350e000)
```

So in this sense the only thing to fix is to add `planarity` to dependencies of `gap_packages`. I've checked that `Digraphs` passes its own testsuite, just in case.

I've added this, and missing deps, and the correct tarball checksum for libsemigroups from #27396. I didn't try to remove dead wood copy of planarity installed by
Digraph, as this appears to be harmless, and won't be needed once we get updated Digraph.
