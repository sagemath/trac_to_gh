```
Adds an 'optional' tag called 'build' (name to be bikeshedded if necessary) specifically for tests related to sage-the-distribution and Sage's build system.

This allows downstream distributions that package Sage differently to skip these tests, but they are enabled by default when the tests are run from a build in Sage's source repository.

This provides a possible solution to #27621.

Added `# optional - build` to several tests in `sage.misc.package`, but perhaps some of the downstream packagers could mention some other problem test if there are any.

That's interesting...

Yes at runtime definitely.

At configure time it is still used for optional bindings that have code. At the moment I replace it by querying environment variables in `sage_setup/optional_extension.py`. If it could be replaced by a `setup.cfg` that could be generated by `configure` - or the package building system - that would be great. On the other hand that would mean people couldn't just do a `sage -i ....` followed by `sage -b` to rebuild for the package they have just added.

Lastly the doctesting system relies on `is_package_installed` to figure some of the options you have enabled when passed `--optional=all`. I just cannot think of how to replace that.

I think I see what you're saying.

I think the default guessing behavior is pretty good as-is though unless someone can find a strong counter-example.
