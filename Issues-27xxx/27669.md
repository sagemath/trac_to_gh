The algorithm is behaving as a simple bfs algorithm instead of bidirectional bfs which should explore nodes from both the directions.
Following bug is fixed by this ticket:
(This is probably a typo as the whole code suggest it is intended to be written for bidirectional bfs)

<a id='comment:7'>Comment 7:</a>
Another issue is that list `next_current` is modified inside a `for u in next_current:` loop (see copy/paste below). Clearly not good. So I agree with this change.

```
            for u in next_current:
                if out == 1:
                    neighbors = self._cg.out_neighbors(u)
                elif self._cg_rev is not None: # Sparse
                    neighbors = self._cg_rev.out_neighbors(u)
                else: # Dense
                    neighbors = self._cg.in_neighbors(u)
                for v in neighbors:
                    # If the neighbor is new, updates the distances and adds
                    # to the list.
                    if v not in dist_current:
                        dist_current[v] = dist_current[u] + 1
                        if not distance_flag:
                            pred_current[v] = u
                        next_current.append(v)
```
