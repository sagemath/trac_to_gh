In [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45896/error-some-variable-ranges-specify-variables-while-others-do-not/), one user is confused because of the error message "Some variable ranges specify variables while others do not", which occurs in plotting when you use arguments like (x, 0, 1) together with (0, 2). But it just checks to see if the ranges have different lengths, it doesn't first check to see if any of the ranges don't make any sense at all, like `(x, -0,5, 1.5)` (the comma in "-0,5" should be a period, but since it's not, the tuple has length 4).
