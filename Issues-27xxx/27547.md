In [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45896/error-some-variable-ranges-specify-variables-while-others-do-not/), one user is confused because of the error message "Some variable ranges specify variables while others do not", which occurs in plotting when you use arguments like (x, 0, 1) together with (0, 2).
