Currently we have spanning_trees function to list all the spanning trees of undirected graph. But does not take the weight of edges into account. This ticket aims at implementing such algorithms to output all spanning trees of an undirected weighted graph in increasing order of weights. This can be of potential use for applications requiring additional constraints other than least weights.

Pertaining to my last commit:

I just wanted to share my progress so far. 

The implementation is not right yet, and doesn't produce correct results. I think I understand how the algorithm is supposed to work, but still trying to wrap my head around how to properly implement it, especially when it comes to using data structures like circular doubly linked list and indexed priority queues.

If we let T be a graph, it might cause issues with the priority queue. I recall trying to do this, but with `new_graph`, and there was a comparison-related error. I guess that the current heap implementation can't compare graphs to see which is "less than" or "greater than" so as to push or pop from the heap. 

I'll try and see how it goes!
