Currently we have spanning_trees function to list all the spanning trees of undirected graph. But does not take the weight of edges into account. This ticket aims at implementing such algorithms to output all spanning trees of an undirected weighted graph in increasing order of weights. This can be of potential use for applications requiring additional constraints other than least weights.

We wish to get an iterator over the spanning trees in increasing order of weights. Also the multiple edges must be taken into account and their different weights. This can't be done just by sorting the results based on weight.
I have linked some papers citing optimized algorithms to achieve the same at the beginning comment of this tkt.

Sorting spanning trees by weight will not give wrong results. The problem is that the number of spanning trees can be too huge to be stored. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree. So an iterator is much better.

I just wanted to share my progress so far. 

The implementation is not right yet, and doesn't produce correct results. I think I understand how the algorithm is supposed to work, but still trying to wrap my head around how to properly implement it, especially when it comes to using data structures like circular doubly linked list and indexed priority queues.

- The cycle basis should be computed outside the while loop, so only once
- To simplify your tests, it might be interesting to create the graph of each cycle of the basis. Then you can search for the graph containing a given edge `f`
- Similarly, it might be easier to let T be a graph instead of a list of edges. The goal is first to get a valid implementation. Then you can search for a faster method

Gotcha, dcoudert

If we let T be a graph, it might cause issues with the priority queue. I recall trying to do this, but with `new_graph`, and there was a comparison-related error. I guess that the current heap implementation can't compare graphs to see which is "less than" or "greater than" so as to push or pop from the heap. 

I'll try and see how it goes!

No significant progress yet. I intend to start afresh, so it'll take some time before I can submit new code.
