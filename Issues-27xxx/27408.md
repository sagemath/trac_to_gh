This ticket implements an edge view for graphs, as discussed in #22349 and in [this message](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/uEHBKekJ_Cw/peoyx4PaBQAJ).

An edge view is a read-only iterable container of edges enabling operations like `for e in E` and `e in E`. In can be iterated multiple times. Checking membership is done in constant time. It avoids the construction of edge lists and so consumes little memory.

This is a first draft of an `EdgeView`. I tried to combined the flexibility offered by the parameters of `.edges()` and `.edge_iterator()`. I have not tested it with Python3 yet, only with Python2 to understand the impact and what should be fixed.

Feedback is more than welcome, for instance concerning:
- Is the location OK or should we move it another file ?
- Should it be in Cython ?
- how to make `next(E)` ?
- should we add the option to call `E[i]` to get the ith edge, even if it's slow ?

OK. We can still do `next(iter(E))` to get first edge if needed.

We can certainly also replace `edge_iterator` by the `EdgeView`, but this can induce a small slow down.

I have also create a class `VertexView` currently raising `NotImplementedError`. I'm not sure if it's needed.

The various combinatorial sets in sage implements `.first()` and `.last()`.

```
sage: Partitions(5).first()
[5]
sage: Partitions(5).last()
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

> We can certainly also replace `edge_iterator` by the `EdgeView`, but this can induce a small slow down.

To avoid slowdown there are several possibilities:
- cache the edge view of the whole graph
- have a pool of edge views to avoid creating the objects

Then remove it for now. I think that there are enough troubles introducing this `EdgeView`.

Actually, the above makes sense if you want the following to be fast

```
sage: (0,3) in G.edges()
```
(Am I right that `G.edges()` would return the view?)

`.first()` is easy, but `.last()` requires to iterate over all edges.

Actually, in the current implementation, when `sort=True`, we store a sorted list of edges. So getting the last one becomes easy. But when `sort=False`, we have to iterate.
Furthermore, as the view is updated as the graph, we cannot store first/last edge.

> - cache the edge view of the whole graph

I don't know how to do that...

> (Am I right that `G.edges()` would return the view?)

Yes.

Why the attributes `graph`, `directed`, etc of `EdgeView` do not start with underscore? With this version they would appear in the tab-completion which is not desirable.

The `sorted` function does not need a list as input. Replace `sorted(list(edges), ...)` with `sorted(edges, ...)`.

Why do you store the `directed` attribute in `EdgeView`?

What I mean by cache is that the graph class could have a `_edge_view` attribute which is initialized with `EdgeView(self)` in `Graph.__init__`. Even if edges are added to the graph the edge view is magically updated (though you need to remove the `directed` attribute). It might even make sense to have two versions: `_edge_view` and `_edge_view_unlabelled`.

What do you think of this proposal from #22349?

1. Make the default `sort=None`. In this case, give a deprecation warning and try to sort but fail gracefully if the input is not sortable.

2. If `sort=True` is given, always sort (raising an exception if the sorting failed)

3. If `sort=False` is given, never sort.

```python

which I find easier to read and it's probably more efficient too.

This is also `__getitem__`. The call `X.[a:b:c]` is transformed into `X.__getitem__(slice(a,b,c))`. You can do something as simple as

```
def __getitem__(self, i):
    if isinstance(i, slice):
        return list(self).__getitem__(i)
```
(or possibly be a little bit smarter using `islice` from `itertools`).

Sorry, the attributes are `start`, `stop`, `step`. When you know the length you can use the method `indices` of the slice to find out the (correctly bounded) `start`, `stop`, `step` as in

```
sage: slice(1, -1, 2).indices(23)

Various comments about `views.pyx`:

1. Instead of `class EdgesView():`, I suggest a Cython class `cdef class EdgesView:` (dropping the empty tuple since that looks strange to me). This requires explicitly declaring attributes but it will be faster. It also requires merging `__mul__` and `__rmul__`.

2. `<int>i` is not correct (the correct cast is `<Py_ssize_t>`) and not needed (Cython should do the type conversion automatically): just replace `<int>i` by `i`.

3. I personally dislike code of the form

```
            try:
                yield from sorted(self, key=self._sort_edges_key)
            except Exception as msg:
                raise TypeError("the edges cannot be sorted due to " + msg)
```
just keep the original exception, drop the `try`/`except`.

4. The proper way to deal with unknown types in `__eq__`, `__add__` and friends is to `return NotImplemented`.

5. In `__mul__`, drop the check for `n < 1`, leave that to `list`.

6. It would be good to implement `__bool__` too (for checking non-emptyness).

I have not (yet) done the change `cdef class EdgesView:` as I don't know how to properly define the types of the variables.

- `_vertices` can be list, and then we have to handle empty list case instead of assigning `G`
- `_vertex_set` is frozenset
- `_labels` is boolean, but it prevents `None`
- `_sort_edges` is a boolean
- `_sort_edges_key` is a function. What's the appropriate type ?

Also, I did not get how to merge `__mul__` and `__rmul__`. Any pointer is welcome.

First of all, making the attributes `readonly` is a good idea anyway. There is no reason why they should only be accessible from Cython.

Second, the correct way to deal with `__eq__` (or really any other place where you do a type check for `EdgesView`) is to write code as follows:

```
def __eq__(self, right):
    if not isinstance(right, EdgesView):
        return NotImplemented
    other = <EdgesView>right
```
This way, Cython knows that `other` is an instance of `EdgesView` and it will use optimized access to the `cdef` attributes. Otherwise, Cython accesses those attributes as Python attributes, which is must slower (and requires `readonly` or `public`).

Some more comments:

1. Moving the handling of `sort=None` to `GenericGraph` (in line with [comment:17])

2. `self._sort_edges = False if sort is False else True` should be simply `self._sort_edges = sort` then (since `_sort_edges` is declared `bint`, Cython automatically does the conversion to `bool`)

3. `self._graph = <GenericGraph_pyx>G` is very dangerous as no type check is done. Replace this by `self._graph = <GenericGraph_pyx?>G` which is the same, except that an exception is raised by Cython if `G` is not an instance of `GenericGraph_pyx`.

4. Use `def __add__(left, right)` instead of `def __add__(self, other)` since using the name `self` here is potentially confusing. Same for `__mul__`.

5. I have some doubts about `start, stop, step = i.start or 0, i.stop or sys_maxsize, i.step or 1` but I'll need to check precise `slice` behavior.

I don't quite like this code:

        if self._sort_edges is True:
            self._sort_edges = False
            yield from sorted(self, key=self._sort_edges_key)

            self._sort_edges = False

            self._sort_edges = True
```
First of all, the condition should be `if self._sort_edges:`, dropping the `None` case. Second, mutating `_sort_edges` like this looks dangerous: what if the iteration is interrupted for example? Two alternatives:

A. Create a new `EdgesView` with `sorted=False` and use that to iterate.

B. Factor out the iteration-without-sorting to a separate method and call that from `__iter__`.

Actually, looking better at `__add__`, you're not really assuming anything about the types of `left` and `right`, only that they are iterable. So why not just drop the condition completely and allow any iterable for `left` and `right`? That would also solve the case `list` + `EdgesView` for example.

- for the iterator, I added a method to iterate unsorted edges. This is cleaner now.

- for `__add__`, I tried to drop tests and got

```
File "src/sage/graphs/views.pyx", line 628, in sage.graphs.views.EdgesView.__add__
Failed example:
    E + 'foo'
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'sage.graphs.views.EdgesView' and 'str'
Got:
    [(0, 1, None),
     (0, 2, None),
     (1, 3, None),
     (2, 3, None),
     (2, 4, None),
     (3, 4, None),
     'f',
     'o',
     'o']
```
  So I added a test on `left`.

I let you guys decide if another round of review is necessary or not.

As this is a big change, shouldn't we add a specific note in the release changelog or in the documentation of the graph module ?
(by the way, sage-8.8.txt is missing in the [Changelogs](https://www.sagemath.org/changelogs/index.html) page)
