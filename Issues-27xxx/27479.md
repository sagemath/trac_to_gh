Using `_singular_init_()` univariate polynomial rings get global monomial ordering `lp` no matter what:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 1, order='negdegrevlex')
sage: R._singular_init_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

Contrast with multivariate:

```
sage: S.<y,z> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order='negdegrevlex')
sage: S._singular_init_()
polynomial ring, over a field, local ordering
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering ds
//                  : names    y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

As long as `neg*` orders are allowed (see [#10708](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10708)) this should be fixed (and it seems easy to fix).

This is also the cause of a bug in `multiplicity()` for subschemes of the affine line:

```
sage: A1.<x> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
sage: X = A1.subscheme([x^1789+x])
sage: Q = X([0])
sage: X.multiplicity(Q)
1789
```

as reported in [Ask SageMath question #45777](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45777/multiplicity-of-a-point-in-a-scheme/).

Keywords: PolynomialRing, Singular, order
