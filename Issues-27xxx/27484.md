A few packages which are currently optional are configured using cmake.

We should add a `sdh_cmake` helper function to `sage-dist-helpers` analogous to `sdh_configure` for running `cmake` with the correct flags for building in Sage.

In particular we need to set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL`, and we also need to specify `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib`, since otherwise CMake will default to installing libraries to `$(prefix)/lib64` on some platforms.
