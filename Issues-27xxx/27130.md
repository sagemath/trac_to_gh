For example, the lattice

```
L = LatticePoset((range(9), [(0,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,5),(3,7),(4,6),(4,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8)]))
```

(a 3-cube with an extra point added at the bottom) will never be generated by `posets.RandomLattice()`.

The algorithm used to generate random lattices is to construct a join-semilattice, successively adding new minimum elements by choosing an admissible upper cover for them at random; and finally making a lattice by adding a bottom element. (Note that the code looks like it is doing the dual of this, but the thing gets turned upside-down when passed to the Poset constructor.) The problem is in the method used to search for an admissible upper cover for the new element: it adds random elements to the antichain one by one, checking at each stage whether the antichain is admissible (i.e. whether adding the new element will preserve unique joins). But not all admissible antichains can be obtained in this way, as the example above demonstrates: in order to construct it, the point 1 has to be added below the antichain {2,3,4}; but no 2-element subset of {2,3,4} is admissible. Furthermore, the lattice cannot be constructed in any way that avoids this step.

A possible fix would be at each step to select the antichain at random from the set of all antichains (repeatedly until an admissible antichain is selected), rather than build it up incrementally. It would, I think, be reasonably efficient to maintain the set of antichains as the random lattice is constructed, since after adding a new element the new antichains are just the old ones with the new element possibly added provided they don't contain any elements below the upper cover just selected. On the other hand, the set of antichains probably grows quite fast as the lattice grows. A method that avoids this cost while still being able to generate all possible lattices would be interesting, but I can't think of one.

(This method would remove the need for the parameter p; alternatively p could be used to bias the selection of antichains in favour of larger or smaller ones.)

- Finally add a bottom element. (The code only generates a join semilattice.)

It does then generate non-trivial lattices. But not all of them. It only generates 2 out of the 5 possible 5-point lattices.

I was overthinking the problem. we don't need to maintain a list of antichains. We can just generate random antichains on the fly at each step, repeating until we find an admissible one.

Working on a patch...

True, my fault. Also I did not enough random testing for random lattices: I tested that all 8-element lattices are generated, not for 9-element lattices.

Number of possible antichains is of course `O(n!)`, just take an antichain with upper cover added.

As a quick fix at least one can create a random poset and run `completion_by_cuts()` to it, but that is also slow.

When doing this I remember thinking about speed and possible algorithms. One possibility could be making a random antichain, and if it not admissible, removing elements from it.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

I wrote some quick (well, not that quick) test code to get a sense of how varying p changed the 'spread' of isomorphism classes of lattices produced:

```python
def iso_invariant(L):
    """ Quick and dirty isomorphism-invariant, hopefully enough to distinguish
        most non-isomorphic pairs.
    """
    return (L.height(), L.width(), L.relations_number(), len(L.coatoms()), len(L.atoms()), len(L.meet_irreducibles()), len(L.join_irreducibles()))
def variation(n, p, k):
    S = set(iso_invariant(posets.RandomLattice(n, p)) for _ in xrange(k))
    return len(S)
def variations(n, k):
    ps = [0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0.995]
    return [(p, variation(n,p,k)) for p in ps]
```

I ran it with n=9 and n=20, each time with k=1000. This leads me to think that p=0.9 may be a good choice:

```
sage: a = variations(9, 1000); a
