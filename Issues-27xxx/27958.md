<a id='comment:9'></a>Having more integration algorithms tried by default is a very good move. However, doctests should get more analyzed:

This part of the patch looks weird:

```
-can do, but Sage currently can't do::
+can do, but Sage currently cannot do::
 
-    sage: integrate(log(x)*exp(-x^2), x)        # todo -- Mathematica can do this
-    integrate(e^(-x^2)*log(x), x)
+    sage: integrate(log(x)*exp(-x^2), x)
+    1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
```

Even if Sage is not able to perform the nice simplifications, this *looks* pretty correct (though i am not analyst):

```
sage: f = 1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
sage: g =  f.derivative(x)
sage: h = g - log(x)*exp(-x^2)
sage: h.full_simplify()
1/18*(4*x^3*hypergeometric((3/2, 3/2), (5/2, 5/2), -x^2) - 18*x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2) + 9*sqrt(pi)*erf(x))/x
sage: h.plot(x,0,1)
```

That function looks like the zero function ?

<a id='comment:14'></a>Some other remarks:

- when you write that Sage can "now" compute some integral, it might be good to refer to `:trac:`27958`` so that interested people could see how and where the issue was fixed.
- when you add some conversions dict that are not indirectly tested with the examples, it might be good to doctest them explicitely (i am thinking in particular to the `sign` conversion for fricas, but maybe there are other that you added without the need to let the new example work, but only you can track those without effort).

Since it still uses `maxima` as its first try, the time will get worse only in those cases were Sage was returning an error or an unevaluated integral (both results are useless, i would say, so one shouldn't care).

<a id='comment:21'></a>as I said in comment:5, sometimes sympy seems to hang forever. Here is one case :

```
sage: %time integrate(sqrt(1-3*sin(x)^2),x)
CPU times: user 252 ms, sys: 3.93 ms, total: 256 ms
Wall time: 274 ms
integrate(sqrt(-3*sin(x)^2 + 1), x)
sage: %time integrate(sqrt(1-3*sin(x)^2),x,algorithm='giac')
CPU times: user 2.85 ms, sys: 3.85 ms, total: 6.7 ms
Wall time: 85.3 ms
integrate(sqrt(-3*sin(x)^2 + 1), x)
sage: %time integrate(sqrt(1-3*sin(x)^2),x,algorithm='sympy')
NOTHING HAPPENS...
```
So this behaviour is now inherited by our integration.

One can hope that the users will CTRL-C. Or use a time-out ??

It seems to me that this is a reasonable prize to pay for having more success, in particular with integrals contaiing abs(), now that we have disabled maxima's `abs_integrate`.

**EDIT**:

in this case, sympy succeeds after not so long!!

```
sage: %time integrate(sqrt(1-3*sin(x)^2),x)
CPU times: user 1min 47s, sys: 346 ms, total: 1min 47s
Wall time: 1min 50s

<a id='comment:25'></a>and the bot is still fully green.

Note that sometimes it is giac, rather than sympy, that hangs, for example in

```
integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)), x)
```

**EDIT**
In giac itself, `integrate(sqrt(x + sqrt(x)),x);` returns an error quickly.

**EDIT**
Does not hang in Python2, only in Python3 !!!

**EDIT**: Apparently, in sage+py3, the giac interface cannot recover from a crash of Giac..

```
giac('int(sqrt(x+sqrt(x)),x)')
Giac crashed -- automatically restarting.
HANGS..
```

Bernard Parisse made a workaround commit:

- https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/68668/

and Giac can now evaluate this integral to:

```
2*(2*((1/6*sqrt(x)+1/24)*sqrt(x)-1/16)*sqrt(x+sqrt(x))-1/16*ln(abs(2*(sqrt(x+sqrt(x))-sqrt(x))-1)))
```

sage: integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x)
1/2*sqrt(pi)*erf(x)*log(x) - x*hypergeometric((1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 3/2), -x^2)
```
Though this takes 10 secs!!!

Also taking the numerical approximation of a symbolic integral is the last thing you want to do to evaluate numerically an integral. We should not tell users to do that.

since it was decided in ticket #27958, comment [comment:58] (while the book was already in print by SIAM), not to accept doctests that do not pass in Python3 (while the book was publicly available since a long time, and nobody asked before for the doctests to be compatible with Python 3), the doctests in Sage do no longer correspond to those in the book, and I have decided not to spend any more time on this.

In summary: do whatever you want, those doctests are no more relevant for the french book.

I did not know about what happend with this ticket. It is indeed unfortunate... the switch to Python 3 is a long and painful route.

But the matter under discussion here is of different nature.  The single test under discussion is

```
N(integrate(exp(-x^2)*log(x), x, 17, 42))
```
There is a positive change of behavior since Sage will now symbolically integrate `exp(-x^2)*log(x)`. As the doctest was used to illustrate the fact that numerical integration was possible on unevaluated integrals it would not make sense anymore. It is rather the book that has to be adapted here (contrarily to #23572 where the doctest framework should have been adapted).

Isn't there a document that explains what has changed between the available version of the book and the current Sage version? I think this would be very useful.
