<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently `libgap.xxx` fails if `xxx` is not in one of the two hard coded lists `common_gap_functions` or `common_gap_globals`. This has the following consequences:

- Additional maintenance burden: Sage needs to be updated whenever GAP introduces a new useful global function/object.
- This is arbitrarily preventing expert users from accessing functions they may deem interesting
- More important: if a user installs additional packages, he can't access its functions via `libgap.xxx`.

Proposal: resort to libgap.eval("xxx") if `xxx` is not in the predefined lists. In fact, it seems that we could always resort to libgap.eval("xxx"): tests seems to be passing as well with the attached branch, and the code is simpler.

Hi Dima!

Thanks for the quick feedback.

> for tab-completions, perhaps?

Yeah, I can indeed see the motivation of presenting a trimmed down tab-completion list for users. Although (but that's a different discussion) I would tend to consider that we should not be maintaining such a list ourselves, but rather somehow fetch it from GAP: they know better!

But it's one thing not to advertise, and another to prevent access.

> I'd rather see `libgap.xxx` becoming, if needed, `libgap.function_factory('xxx')`

I am not sure what you mean. We agree that, if GAP or some GAP package defines some important top level entry point `Foo`, then we want it to be accessible as `libgap.Foo`, right?

For the record: before this change:

```
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 2114820.50 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1 loop, best of 3: 954 ns per loop
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 9.65 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 618 ns per loop
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 23.93 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 628 ns per loop
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 9.45 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 631 ns per loop
```

After the change:

```
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 118578.25 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1 loop, best of 3: 1.91 µs per loop
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 9.47 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 629 ns per loop
sage: %timeit libgap.Group
The slowest run took 22.15 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 624 ns per loop
```

So no noticeable influence on tight loops involving `libgap.Foo` access.

I think building the autocomplete list is slow because gap is grinding though of its files; Just sending a bunch of strings over to Sage is not going to be noticeable. Also it tends to cough up a lot of package-private functions in GAP that necessarily are in the public namespace but users aren't really supposed to access.
