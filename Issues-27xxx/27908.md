The hash of polynomials intenionally makes use of the string hash of its variable names. This differs in each Python 3 session, so that the order of polynomials when iterating over sets is not consistent. Sets are used both in the implementation of `random_element()` and `buchberger()`, so this is the root reason for all the doctest failures fixed in this ticket.

In `toy_buchberger` I chose to keep the protocol output of `buchberger()` by declaring it random, as it seems educationally useful. I could have used a py2 directive, but chose not to mainly to keep the test from being removed when Python 2 support is dropped. I removed the protocol output for `buchberger_improved()` and only test for the number of reductions-to-zero, as it seems enough to see the protocol once in the docs.

I also fixed most of the PEP warnings in `toy_buchberger`.
