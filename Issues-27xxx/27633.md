As discussed in #22173, the current the design of the hyperelliptic curves classes was not good.

This changes create the (genus, ring) subclasses dynamically, removing the need for a class/file per case.

<a id='comment:3'></a>This is a good move.

The logic in the following is weird

```
fld = map(lambda fnc : fnc(R), [is_FiniteField, is_RationalField, is_pAdicField])
fld_type = fld.index(True)
```
You would rather do something like

```
fields = [
   ("FiniteField", is_FiniteField, HyperellipticCurve_finite_field),
   ("RationalField", is_RationalField, HyperellipticCurve_rational_field),
   ("pAdicField", is_pAdicField, HyperellipticCurve_padic_field)]
for name, test, cls in fields:
    if test(R):
        ....    # treat the class
        break   # the tests are exclusive, no need to run through all cases
```

How about this new version? There I just use the information of the classes that are imported in the module.

The methods in `HyperellipticCurve_rational_field` and others use methods from `HyperellipticCurve_generic`, so I don't think that it is a good idea.

Agreed, I included the functionality and added a test for it.

This is terrible. Explicit code is to my mind much better. With the current version, a curious person looking at the code would have no clue about how it works.

The list has length one and after #22173 it will have length two. I don't understand this objection.

> I do agree that it is not very reader-friendly as it is. This could easily be fixed with more comments/documentation.


"Terrible design" is appropriate.

1. As I said it is unreadable.

2. The code is sensitive to code injection

```
sage: import sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor as constructor
sage: constructor.HyperellipticCurve_g3 = int
```
You might consider this as a super feature, but it is very much error prone.

3. The way it is written goes through several dictionary accesses and a try/except each time a hyperelliptic curve is created. This is a waste of time as you want constructors to be as light as possible.
