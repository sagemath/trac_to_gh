As discussed in #22173, the current the design of the hyperelliptic curves classes was not good.

This changes create the (genus, ring) subclasses dynamically, removing the need for a class/file per case.

<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
This is a good move.

The logic in the following is weird

```
fld = map(lambda fnc : fnc(R), [is_FiniteField, is_RationalField, is_pAdicField])
fld_type = fld.index(True)
```
You would rather do something like

```
fields = [
   ("FiniteField", is_FiniteField, HyperellipticCurve_finite_field),
   ("RationalField", is_RationalField, HyperellipticCurve_rational_field),
   ("pAdicField", is_pAdicField, HyperellipticCurve_padic_field)]
for name, test, cls in fields:
    if test(R):
        ....    # treat the class
        break   # the tests are exclusive, no need to run through all cases
```

Similarly, why do you construct a dictionary in the following

```
+    genus_class = {2:HyperellipticCurve_g2}
+    if g in genus_class.keys():
+        supercls.append(genus_class[g])
```
This is simpler as

```
if g == 2:
    supercls.append(HyperellipticCurve_g2)
```

This I did with #22173 in mind, where I will add the class for genus 3 to the dictionary (I am working on it right now). In general, if more genus are added, then using the dictionary leads to a cleaner code than a list of ifs.

What do you think about removing the inheritance from `HyperellipticCurve_generic`
in `HyperellipticCurve_rational_field`, `HyperellipticCurve_padic_field`, etc? All the inheritance is handled by this new function anyway.

In this case, the function would be

```
cls = [HyperellipticCurve_generic]

...

if len(cls) > 1:   # contains more than just HyperellipticCurve_generic
    cls = type("HyperellipticCurve_" + "_".join(cls_name), tuple(cls), {})

return cls(PP, f, h, names=names, genus=g)
```

How about this new version? There I just use the information of the classes that are imported in the module.

The methods in `HyperellipticCurve_rational_field` and others use methods from `HyperellipticCurve_generic`, so I don't think that it is a good idea.

This is terrible. Explicit code is to my mind much better. With the current version, a curious person looking at the code would have no clue about how it works.

The list has length one and after #22173 it will have length two. I don't understand this objection.

"Terrible design" is appropriate.

1. As I said it is unreadable.

2. The code is sensitive to code injection

```
sage: import sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor as constructor
sage: constructor.HyperellipticCurve_g3 = int
```
You might consider this as a super feature, but it is very much error prone.

3. The way it is written goes through several dictionary accesses and a try/except each time a hyperelliptic curve is created. This is a waste of time as you want constructors to be as light as possible.

<a id='comment:23'>Comment 23:</a>
Is it better to add a test for every case or with the one you gave it's enough?

Also, while looking into this I realized that I am duplicating the classes with only one superclass.

```
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(GF(next_prime(10^9)))
sage: C = HyperellipticCurve(t^7 + t + 1)
sage: import inspect
sage: inspect.getmro(type(C))
(<class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor.HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField_with_category'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.constructor.HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_finite_field.HyperellipticCurve_finite_field'>,
 <class 'sage.schemes.hyperelliptic_curves.hyperelliptic_generic.HyperellipticCurve_generic'>,
...)
```

Would it be preferable to initiate the `created_classes` dictionary with the classes `HyperellipticCurve_g2`, `HyperellipticCurve_FiniteField`, etc to avoid that? That could also simplify the last part of the code if `HyperellipticCurve_generic` was added too.

Even nicer.

One last little thing. In the documentation, you need a linebreak after `::`.
