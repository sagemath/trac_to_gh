This project is my master thesis. I want to implement a computation of characteristic classes of vector bundles out of their curvature matrices. The algorithm is based on [this](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Prof-Geometrie/Dokumente/Lehre/Lehrmaterialien/charakteristisch.pdf) short script.

In this first step, the graded algebra of "mixed" differential forms of a manifold will be introduced so one can use the matrix framework of sage in the following steps.

A demo notebook is provided at https://github.com/DeRhamSource/MixedFormNotebook

Here is the answer to the question raised in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/hwsQWuLN0nc/1_8LjLL4AgAJ, namely when `a` is a differential form (from previously existing `DiffForm` class) and `A` is a mixed form (as introduced in this ticket), why do we get

```
sage: a.__mul__(A)
Mixed differential form A/\a on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
I think this results from a clash between (i) the operator `__mul__` being used to denote the wedge product for mixed differential forms and (ii) the operator `__mul__` being used to denote tensor product for differential forms. Indeed `a.__mul__(A)`  calls the method `__mul__` implemented in line 2169 of `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py`, which is devoted to the tensor product (the differential form `a` being considered as a tensor field of type (0,p), where p=degree(a)). As you can see in line 2269, if `A` does not belong to the class `TensorField`, one assumes that `A` is a scalar field (the only possible case until this ticket) and the code return `A*a`, i.e. `A.wedge(a)`. 

A possible solution could be to change the lines 2269-2271 of `tensorfield.py` to

```
if isinstance(other, MixedForm):
    return other.parent()(self)._mul_(other)
elif not isinstance(other, TensorField):
    # Multiplication by a scalar field or a number
    return other * self
```
A better way would be to redefine `__mul__` in `DiffForm`, falling back to the tensor field version if `other` is not a mixed form.

Since the file is not very large, I guess it suffices to run

```
git rm scripts/MixedAlgebra.ipynb
```
before your next commit. 
Otherwise (i.e. for a large file), I would have recommended to delete the branch and to start a brand new one. 
> In the next step, I will translate the notebook to english and add Doctests to the main files. Then, I guess, it's ready for review.


OK very good!

```

sage: A = M.mixed_form_algebra()
sage: A._element_constructor_(x).disp(X.frame())

----> 1 A(x).disp(X.frame())

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'disp'

How is that possible? Shouldn't A(.) invoke the method A._element_constructor_?

A few unrelated comments:

`isinstance(comp, (int, Integer))` -> `comp in ZZ` because it also catches cases like `2/1` (which is in `QQ`).

A few of your example blocks should be `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` when followed immediately by doctests, which should also be indentent 1 level.

Thanks! :)

The snippet `isinstance(comp, (int, Integer))` is adapted from `diff_form_module.py`. Should I apply your suggestion in that file as well for this branch, then?

More feedback and suggestions are very welcome! :)

Unfortunately, there is no error message or traceback:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: A = M.mixed_form_algebra()
sage: A(x)
```

The coercion is already known:

```
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra().has_coerce_map_from(SR)
True
```

So, I have really no idea why it won't work. But for scalar fields, it does:

```
sage: f = M.scalar_field_algebra()(x); f
Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I think the issue arises because `SR` is the base ring of the algebra `A`:

```
sage: A.base_ring()
Symbolic Ring
```
If I am correct, in such a case, the coercion `SR` --> `A` is implemented via the algebra operation `x * A.one()`, not via `_element_constructor_`. In the present case, `x * A.one()` fails:

```
sage: x * A.one()
...
RuntimeError: BUG in map, returned None x <type 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'> Generic morphism:
  From: Symbolic Ring
  To:   Graded algebra Omega^*(M) of mixed differential forms on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
To make it work, you should implement the method `_lmul_` in class `MixedForm` and add the line 

```
    if other is SR:
        return True
```
in `MixedFormAlgebra._coerce_map_from_`. At least, this is what is done for the algebras of scalar fields: see line 512 of `src/sage/manifolds/scalarfield_algebra.py` and the definition of `_lmul_` in line 2449 of `src/sage/manifolds/scalarfield.py`.

I am a little worried about this. What about `_rmul_`? This also makes the dependence too strong on the base ring being `SR`. Can we use `if other is self.base_ring()` or something like that?

I managed the coercion detection via

```
        if self._domain.scalar_field_algebra().has_coerce_map_from(S):
            return True
```

Does that also eliminate your doubts concerning the strong dependencies on SR, Travis?

I see in line 2394 of `src/sage/structure/element.pyx` that `_rmul_` falls back to `_lmul_`, which is not implemented at the `ModuleElement` level (actually returns `None`).

Travis, do you confirm?

Ah, right, I forgot that generic `_rmul_` was implemented in `ModuleElement`.

So Sage's `_rmul_` should not be confused with Python's `__rmul__`.

Python's `__rmul__` is for when `self` knows how to multiply with `other` when `self` is on the right, but `other` does not. For instance, it handles `5 * self` because we cannot override the `int` type (which means the "standard `int.__mul__`" fails), but `self` knows what to do.

Sage's `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` play the same role, just on different sides. They are there to implement actions of `other` on `self` on the right or left, and thus are used by the coercion framework (in particular, they check if coercions can be applied).

Replying to [gh-DeRhamSource](#comment%3A48):
> What should be debugged? I mean, the error above does not seem to have to do something with my implementation. Or does it?
> 
> Long story short: There is no error occuring anymore regarding the mixed algebra while building the doc. 


Yes but some parts of the documentation require some debugging: 

- a formula is not displayed because `.. MATH:` should be `.. MATH::` in line 45 of `mixed_form.py`
- in line 60 of the same file, there is an extra backquote around `comp`
- at the top of `mixed_form.py` you may want to replace `\Phi` by `\varphi` to be consistent with the rest of the text, as well as with `mixed_form_algebra.py`

I have a couple more comments, most of them are fairly minor:

In `_richcmp_`:

```
        from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp

        # Compare all elements separately:
        for j in range(0, self._max_deg + 1):
```
move the import statement to the top-level (this is for speed reasons) and make `range(0, foo)` -> `range(foo)`.

Make `_mul_ = wedge` and maybe combine or reduce the doctests.

<code>degree $k$ along \`\varphi\`</code> replace `&` with <code>\`</code>.

Instead of using `self.__class__`, I have been told it is better to use `type(self)`.

Instead of `\`, my understanding is it is better to use `()` as that is guaranteed to generate an error if misused (as opposed to possibly a strange bug). For example

```diff
-                error_msg = "input must be a " \
-                            "differential form of degree {}".format(deg)
+                error_msg = ("input must be a "
+                             "differential form of degree {}".format(deg))
```

Typo: `datailed` -> `detailed`

I don't think you need the `self._populate_coercion_lists_()`.

While this is definitely a bug, you can get rid of it by replacing

```
f in M.diff_form_module(n)
```
by

```
f.domain() is M and f.degree() == n
```
for any integer `n`. Moreover the second form is must faster.

That error from the patchbot looks unrelated, so I would treat the patchbot as coming back green.

Sorry, one more nitpick for readability:

```diff

-                S._domain) and self._ambient_domain.is_subset(S._ambient_domain)

Yes, there is a doctest error with Python3-built Sage: 

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 48.2 src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form.py

File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form.py", line 479, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.mixed_form.MixedForm.set_name

Expected:
    Mixed differential form fancy on the 4-dimensional differentiable
     manifold M
Got:

    DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \e

You should replace `'\eta'` by `r'\eta'`. 

Apart from this, everything is OK for me.
