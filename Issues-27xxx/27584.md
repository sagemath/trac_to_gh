This project is my master thesis. I want to implement a computation of characteristic classes of vector bundles out of their curvature matrices. The algorithm is based on [this](https://www.math.uni-potsdam.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Prof-Geometrie/Dokumente/Lehre/Lehrmaterialien/charakteristisch.pdf) short script.

In this first step, the graded algebra of "mixed" differential forms of a manifold will be introduced so one can use the matrix framework of sage in the following steps.

A demo notebook is provided at https://github.com/DeRhamSource/MixedFormNotebook

Here is the answer to the question raised in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/hwsQWuLN0nc/1_8LjLL4AgAJ, namely when `a` is a differential form (from previously existing `DiffForm` class) and `A` is a mixed form (as introduced in this ticket), why do we get

```
sage: a.__mul__(A)
Mixed differential form A/\a on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
I think this results from a clash between (i) the operator `__mul__` being used to denote the wedge product for mixed differential forms and (ii) the operator `__mul__` being used to denote tensor product for differential forms. Indeed `a.__mul__(A)`  calls the method `__mul__` implemented in line 2169 of `src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/tensorfield.py`, which is devoted to the tensor product (the differential form `a` being considered as a tensor field of type (0,p), where p=degree(a)). As you can see in line 2269, if `A` does not belong to the class `TensorField`, one assumes that `A` is a scalar field (the only possible case until this ticket) and the code return `A*a`, i.e. `A.wedge(a)`. 

A possible solution could be to change the lines 2269-2271 of `tensorfield.py` to

```
if isinstance(other, MixedForm):
    return other.parent()(self)._mul_(other)
elif not isinstance(other, TensorField):
    # Multiplication by a scalar field or a number
    return other * self
```
A better way would be to redefine `__mul__` in `DiffForm`, falling back to the tensor field version if `other` is not a mixed form.

Since the file is not very large, I guess it suffices to run

```
git rm scripts/MixedAlgebra.ipynb
```
before your next commit. 
Otherwise (i.e. for a large file), I would have recommended to delete the branch and to start a brand new one.

It does, but only after checking for a coercion. So my guess is something is going strange with the coercion. Posting the full traceback would be useful.

A few unrelated comments:

`isinstance(comp, (int, Integer))` -> `comp in ZZ` because it also catches cases like `2/1` (which is in `QQ`).

A few of your example blocks should be `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` when followed immediately by doctests, which should also be indentent 1 level.

The snippet `isinstance(comp, (int, Integer))` is adapted from `diff_form_module.py`. Should I apply your suggestion in that file as well for this branch, then?

More feedback and suggestions are very welcome! :)

Unfortunately, there is no error message or traceback:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: A = M.mixed_form_algebra()
sage: A(x)
```

The coercion is already known:

```
sage: M.mixed_form_algebra().has_coerce_map_from(SR)
True
```

So, I have really no idea why it won't work. But for scalar fields, it does:

```
sage: f = M.scalar_field_algebra()(x); f
Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```

I think the issue arises because `SR` is the base ring of the algebra `A`:

```
sage: A.base_ring()
Symbolic Ring
```
If I am correct, in such a case, the coercion `SR` --> `A` is implemented via the algebra operation `x * A.one()`, not via `_element_constructor_`. In the present case, `x * A.one()` fails:

```
sage: x * A.one()
...
RuntimeError: BUG in map, returned None x <type 'sage.categories.morphism.SetMorphism'> Generic morphism:
  From: Symbolic Ring
  To:   Graded algebra Omega^*(M) of mixed differential forms on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```
To make it work, you should implement the method `_lmul_` in class `MixedForm` and add the line 

```
    if other is SR:
        return True
```
in `MixedFormAlgebra._coerce_map_from_`. At least, this is what is done for the algebras of scalar fields: see line 512 of `src/sage/manifolds/scalarfield_algebra.py` and the definition of `_lmul_` in line 2449 of `src/sage/manifolds/scalarfield.py`.

I am puzzled now about the scalar field algebra implementation. Why do we have `_lmul_` and not `_rmul_`? Indeed, `__rmul__` is the standard Python operator for reflected operands and `__lmul__` does not exist in Python. What's exactly the role of `_lmul_` in Sage? I guess it is there for noncommutative base rings but I could not find a good place in the documentation explaining this... 
In the present case, both for scalar field and mixed form algebras, we are dealing with a base ring that is commutative (since it is a field), so shouldn't we have only `_rmul_`?

I managed the coercion detection via

```
        if self._domain.scalar_field_algebra().has_coerce_map_from(S):
            return True
```

Does that also eliminate your doubts concerning the strong dependencies on SR, Travis?

Ah, right, I forgot that generic `_rmul_` was implemented in `ModuleElement`.

So Sage's `_rmul_` should not be confused with Python's `__rmul__`.

Python's `__rmul__` is for when `self` knows how to multiply with `other` when `self` is on the right, but `other` does not. For instance, it handles `5 * self` because we cannot override the `int` type (which means the "standard `int.__mul__`" fails), but `self` knows what to do.

Sage's `_rmul_` and `_lmul_` play the same role, just on different sides. They are there to implement actions of `other` on `self` on the right or left, and thus are used by the coercion framework (in particular, they check if coercions can be applied).

Yes, I think that is better. Generally, I do not think it is a good idea to hardcode a ring unless you really only want to work with that ring (and my understanding is that this could be made more flexible in the future).

Yes but some parts of the documentation require some debugging: 

- a formula is not displayed because `.. MATH:` should be `.. MATH::` in line 45 of `mixed_form.py`
- in line 60 of the same file, there is an extra backquote around `comp`
- at the top of `mixed_form.py` you may want to replace `\Phi` by `\varphi` to be consistent with the rest of the text, as well as with `mixed_form_algebra.py`

<div id="comment:53" align="right">comment:53</div>

I have a couple more comments, most of them are fairly minor:

In `_richcmp_`:

```
        from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp

        # Compare all elements separately:
        for j in range(0, self._max_deg + 1):
```
move the import statement to the top-level (this is for speed reasons) and make `range(0, foo)` -> `range(foo)`.

Make `_mul_ = wedge` and maybe combine or reduce the doctests.

<code>degree $k$ along \`\varphi\`</code> replace `&` with <code>\`</code>.

Instead of using `self.__class__`, I have been told it is better to use `type(self)`.

Instead of `\`, my understanding is it is better to use `()` as that is guaranteed to generate an error if misused (as opposed to possibly a strange bug). For example

```diff
-                error_msg = "input must be a " \
-                            "differential form of degree {}".format(deg)
+                error_msg = ("input must be a "
+                             "differential form of degree {}".format(deg))
```

Typo: `datailed` -> `detailed`

I don't think you need the `self._populate_coercion_lists_()`.

While this is definitely a bug, you can get rid of it by replacing

```
f in M.diff_form_module(n)
```
by

```
f.domain() is M and f.degree() == n
```
for any integer `n`. Moreover the second form is must faster.

That error from the patchbot looks unrelated, so I would treat the patchbot as coming back green.

Sorry, one more nitpick for readability:

```diff
-            return self._domain.is_subset(
-                S._domain) and self._ambient_domain.is_subset(S._ambient_domain)

Eric, any other comments?

Yes, there is a doctest error with Python3-built Sage: 

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 48.2 src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/manifolds/differentiable/mixed_form.py", line 479, in sage.manifolds.differentiable.mixed_form.MixedForm.set_name
Failed example:

Expected:
    Mixed differential form fancy on the 4-dimensional differentiable
     manifold M
Got:
    doctest:warning
    ...
    DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \e
    Mixed differential form fancy on the 4-dimensional differentiable manifold M

```
You should replace `'\eta'` by `r'\eta'`. 

Apart from this, everything is OK for me.
