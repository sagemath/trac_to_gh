```
If, by some accident, one ends up with multiple stamp files for the same package in `local/var/lib/sage/installed`, an error occurs when running `./configure`.

For example, in my case, in the course of development I somehow accidentally wound up with two install records for different versions of mpir.  This results in an error appearing during `./configure` like:

```
...
    mpc-1.1.0
    mpfi-1.5.2
    mpfr-4.0.1.p0
    mpfrcx-0.5
./configure: line 10692: test: local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868: binary operator expected
    mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
    mpmath-1.1.0
    nauty-26r1.p0
```

Of course, this should never happen during normal development or usage, but apparently it *can* since I somehow made it happen.

Attached is a possible fix: The configure script now detects this condition as an error, and aborts with an error message that's at least a bit more useful than none at all:

```
...
    mpfr-4.0.1.p0
    mpfrcx-0.5
configure: error: multiple installation records for mpir at
local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868
local/var/lib/sage/installed/mpir-3.0.0-644faf502c56f97d9accd301965fc57d6ec70868.p0
only one should exist so please delete one or both files and re-configure
```

It's impossible to know for sure what the best course of action is here, so we give the user a hint and leave it up to them to make a decision and retry.

The branch is on top of #28788.
