Conversion of libgap objects to Sage objects still has many gaps. For example:

```
sage: libgap(GF(3)).GroupRing(AbelianGroup([3,3]))
<algebra-with-one over GF(3), with 2 generators>
sage: _.sage()
Ring of integers modulo 3
```
A wrong answer is worse than no answer, and of course a much better answer would be

```
sage: AbelianGroup([3,3]).algebra(GF(3))
Algebra of Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to C3 x C3 over Finite Field of size 3
```

Keywords: libgap

Status: new

<a id='comment:3'></a>This is still apparently an issue, if anyone would like to take it on.  In this case, improvements can definitely be made to `GapElement_Ring.sage()`.
