<a id='comment:3'>Comment 3:</a>
Builds without a hitch. `ptestlong` gives one permanent failure :

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long --warn-long 154.5 src/sage/libs/giac.py  # 3 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

which is identical in all details to the one already [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/0QvdNonpGEg/SfQHQ6ejAQAJ) before this patch.

Nothing "reasonable" that I've tried worked : it seems that using the library entails the use of configuration executables which have the library path hardcoded, or possibly vice-versa.

So I went unreasonable an installed the library from source via sage -sh under $SAGE_LOCAL. This worked. And is a pain in the *ss...

Thanks for your help !
