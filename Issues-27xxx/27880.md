An upcoming version of Kenzo will include functions to compute homotopy groups. 

This ticket will track the work to update it and the corresponding interface

The tarball of the new version is available at https://github.com/miguelmarco/kenzo/releases/download/1.1.9/kenzo-1.1.9.tar.gz

As usual, the new version can be tested downloading the tarball, putting it in the /upstream/ directory, and runnning


```
sage -f kenzo
```

I have fixed some style and doctests.

Some functions (k2s_matrix, s2k_matrix, s2k_dictmat and pairing) that still need proper dosctrings.

I have been testing the conversion from sage to kenzo simplicial sets, and it seems to be quite fragile at the moment:

```

sage: from sage.homology.simplicial_set import SimplicialSet
sage: S = simplicial_sets.Sphere(3)
sage: W = S.wedge(S)
sage: SimplicialSet(W)
Simplicial set with 3 non-degenerate simplices
sage: KFiniteSimplicialSet(SimplicialSet(W))

Sorry, but I can't figure out how to install kenzo. I tried `make kenzo` followed by `make`, and that didn't work: if I run `sage -t src/sage/interfaces/kenzo.py`, I get errors like

```
RuntimeError: ECL says: The function MAKE-ARRAY-FROM-LISTS is undefined.
```
It seems as though ECL doesn't know about Kenzo.

Anyway, regarding the problem with wedges, in Sage, a simplex in a simplicial set cannot be determined from its name: two different simplices may have the same name. (By default, all n-simplices are just called "sigma_n".)

```
sage: from sage.homology.simplicial_set import SimplicialSet
sage: S = simplicial_sets.Sphere(3)
sage: W = S.wedge(S)
sage: W.n_cells(3)
[sigma_3, sigma_3]
```
But those simplices are not the same:

```
sage: W.n_cells(3)[0] == W.n_cells(3)[1]
False
```
So when translating to a Kenzo simplicial set, you will need to come up with some way of distinguishing non-equal simplices of the same dimension. You could use their hash values, for instance.

I also don't understand this:

```
    if hasattr(ssimpset, 'factors') and str(ssimpset)[0:5] != 'Wedge':
        return KFiniteSimplicialSet(ssimpset.factor(0)).cartesian_product(KFiniteSimplicialSet(ssimpset.factor(1)))
```
First, maybe it would be better to test `if isinstance(ssimpset, Factors)`. Similarly, you could test `isinstance(ssimpset, WedgeOfSimplicialSets)` instead of checking the string representation. Second, there are four types of simplicial sets with factors, not just wedges and Cartesian products: smash products and disjoint unions also. Oh, finally, there could be more than two factors, and the current code just takes `ssimpset.factor(0)` and `ssimpset.factor(1)`.

In the meantime, you can install the testing version of our kenzo fork by cloning the mentioned repo, checking out its testing branch, and runing:

```
sage -ecl < compile.lisp

that will compile the kenzo package into a file called `kenzo--all-systems.fasb`. Then rename it as `kenzo.fas` and copy it to your SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl directory.

Yes, that is my impression too. I was a little worried about the strength of the hash value though: can we guarantee that different cells will always have different hashes? From a quick look at the current code, it seems that the memory address of the object is used in the hash, so it should really distiguish them (modulo hash function collisions), but i wanted to make sure about that.

Since the hash is based on `id(...)`, it should distinguish them.

If you ask this because of the KAbstractSimplex function, I also don't see a point for it. I assumed it was used somewhere else, but apparantely it is not.

Since this is still a work in progress it could happen that it becomes useful at some point. If it doesn't, we can safely remove it.

Some other comments:
- I would prefer that you didn't use `id` for identity morphisms in the examples, since `id` is an important built-in Python function, so I don't like to see it redefined. This is not a major issue.
- I find it odd that `KenzoSimplicialSet` inherits from the chain complex class. This means that if `K` is a Kenzo simplicial set, the help message for `K.homology` says

```
Return the "n"'th homology group of the kenzo chain complex
```
 and also tab completion reveals `K.tensor_product`. I don't know what a tensor product of a simplicial set with a chain complex, or with a simplicial set, is supposed to return.
- I've had some crashes, but they're not repeatable. "Crashes" is the wrong word — "hangs" is better, and ctrl-c has not interrupted the process successfully, or maybe I didn't wait long enough. If I figure out how to reproduce this problem, I'll let you know. Here's an example:

There are lots of functions defined at the start of the file, which means that `from sage.interfaces.kenzo import [TAB]` lists lots of options, most of which the user won't actually want. Is this a problem? I think you could put something like  `del chcm_mat, homologie, ...` at the end of the file, but I don't know if it's worth bothering.

A related question: is it worth putting commands like `ecl_eval("(require :kenzo)")` in a try-except block, so that if users try `import sage.interfaces.kenzo` without first installing Kenzo, they get a better error message than a traceback followed by

```
RuntimeError: ECL says: Module error: Don't know how to REQUIRE KENZO.
```
?

I did some of the changes suggested by jhpalmieri. In particular, I did add the module to the documentation index, used a different name for the identity in the doctests, checked that kenzo is installed, and changed the names of the functions we import prepending a `_`.

I expected this last change to solve the problem of the functions appearing in the tab completion, but they still appear. At least, they appear at the end of the list, which might make clearer to the user that they are auxiliary functions.


I haven't been able to reproduce the hangs. Any hint on what you did to get them?

Replying to [@jhpalmieri](#comment%3A42):
> Are these changes safe?


I would say they are not. Those variables could be zero or empty lists, and not all of those cases are equivalent to being `None`.

Maybe the code could be rewritten to treat those cases correctly, but for the sake of robustness, I would prefear to leave the specific check for being `None`.

We prefer to maintain the same class structure of Kenzo, where a simplicial set is implemented inheriting from the class Chain Complex because one can always define a chain complex associated to every simplicial set, and the homology groups of a simplicial set are defined as the homology groups of the associated chain complex. When we ask for the tensor product of a simplicial set and a chain complex, Kenzo computes the tensor product of the chain complex associated to the simplicial set and the second chain complex.

Okay, in that case I request that you document this: probably document in the class `KenzoSimplicialSet` that the class inherits from chain complexes, and maybe in some of the chain complex methods what happens if you are applying them to simplicial sets.

It is good from my part. It solves the problem of tab completion, and does not introduce other problems.


I haven't been able to reproduce your hangs. I am guessing there might be some system-specific oddity involved.

> Related to the simplicial set/chain complex inheritance: how can I get a chain complex from a simplicial set? For example:

I think you are right. I send a commit to treat the case where a nontrivial module in the chain complex is surrounded with trivial ones.

I added a few lines to clarify that kenzo simplicial sets can be seen as a particular case of chain complexes.

Could not reproduce the problems pointed by jhpalmieri.

Do you agree to give a positive review, and maybe open another ticket to track the heisenbug?

I discovered there is a bug in the Kenzo module to compute the homtopy group:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.kenzo import KFiniteSimplicialSet
sage: CP2 = simplicial_sets.ComplexProjectiveSpace(2)
sage: KCP2 = KFiniteSimplicialSet(CP2)
sage: KCP2.homotopy_group(2)
Multiplicative Abelian group isomorphic to Z
sage: KCP2.homotopy_group(3)
Trivial Abelian group
sage: KCP2.homotopy_group(4)
Trivial Abelian group
sage: KCP2.homotopy_group(5)
Trivial Abelian group
sage: KCP2.homotopy_group(6)
Trivial Abelian group
```

The fifth homotopy groups and higher are wrong.

We have found the source of the error and are working on it. Will make a new release of the kenzo package in a few days.

It is probably this line at the top of the file:

```
+if not 'kenzo' in installed_packages():
+    raise PackageNotFoundError('kenzo')
```
coupled with the fact that it has been added to the references (which it wasn't before).

@vbraun Is there a mechanism in the html doc that catches this error being thrown? Is the same thing not done for the pdf doc?

I see the problem on Ubuntu, and my proposal didn't work, but try this (copied from maxima's spkg-install.in file):

```diff
diff --git a/build/pkgs/kenzo/spkg-install.in b/build/pkgs/kenzo/spkg-install.in

 if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
```
It doesn't create a good manifest file, so uninstallation doesn't do anything. `maxima.fas` is missing from maxima's manifest, too, so I guess we could settle for this.

So that worked. It is strange that this worked on the same machine with 9.1 but not with 9.2.beta0. Something seems to have changed between the two versions...

No, I was using commit 217e47c. Strange.

Thanks. I think you changes are good. I like the explicit check. Back to positive as this should now build the docs as well (at least is does for me).
