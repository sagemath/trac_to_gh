Keywords: spkg-configure

it needs gmp, and is not a dependency of anything (besides sagelib)

To get this package on the system:

* Fedora: gmp-ecm-devel
* Gentoo: gmp-ecm  - (but the version is too old in the main tree. Decent one in the sage-on-gentoo overlay)
* FreeBSD: gmp-ecm

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27271

gmp/mpir is a dependency of ecm! (and so not using system's gmp/mpir and using the system's gmp/mpir for ecm would lead to a lot of linking/loading "fun" with sagelib)

As for the contents of the `ecm/spkg-configure.m4` itself, it looks fine to me at first glance, an I trust you've tested it.

A slightly more "sophisticated" approach might be build a test program which prints the value of the version, but in this case it's simple enough that just grepping for it should be good enough.

I see.  In that case (and we still need a generic way to do this but I think it's tricky), the `ecm/spkg-configure.m4` should do

```
AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])
```

and then refuse to use the system package if `sage_spkg_install_mpir = yes` or `sage_spkg_install_gmp = yes`.
