it needs gmp, and is not a dependency of anything (besides sagelib)

To get this package on the system:

* FreeBSD: gmp-ecm

As for the contents of the `ecm/spkg-configure.m4` itself, it looks fine to me at first glance, an I trust you've tested it.

A slightly more "sophisticated" approach might be build a test program which prints the value of the version, but in this case it's simple enough that just grepping for it should be good enough.

I see.  In that case (and we still need a generic way to do this but I think it's tricky), the `ecm/spkg-configure.m4` should do

```
AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])
```

and then refuse to use the system package if `sage_spkg_install_mpir = yes` or `sage_spkg_install_gmp = yes`.
