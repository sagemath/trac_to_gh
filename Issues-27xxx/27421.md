```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: x.coefficient(x.exponents()[0])
```
gives

```
TypeError: The input degrees must be a dictionary of variables to exponents.
```
and one has to use 

```
sage: x.coefficient(list(x.exponents()[0]))
1
```
as a workaround. However, it seems strange, that the exponents output by the same object are not accepted as input to another method.

This is my first time in sagemath so sorry if I have missed some important community standards.

For the issue I thought two possible solutions:

1) Change the return type of exponents() to list.

2) Change coefficient() to handle the return value of exponents()

Changing the return type of exponents() will affect all the dependent functions of exponents() so I have changed coefficient() to handle ETuple also ( return type of exponents() ).

Last two little things:

1 - You should test `f.coefficient(x.exponents()[0])` to show that the output matches the above (i.e., it is an equivalent input).
2 - Your line `exps[i] = int((<ETuple>degrees).get_exp(i))` is over-indented.

But that is not how `exponents()` works. In the Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field `R.<x,y> = QQ[]` x has exponent (1,0) so `x.exponents()` returns `[(1, 0)]` and so `f.coefficient(x.exponents()[0])` returns `1`.

I don't think changing the behavior of `exponents()` is the right course of action, So can you please explain further the desired behaviour of the `coefficient()` in this case.

Ah, right, it has the `y` value explicitly set. Okay, then let's change the second part of your test to make it more clear what is going on, with a bit more explanation:

```
            sage: f.coefficient(x)
            y^2 + y + 1

        Note that exponents have all variables specified::

            sage: x.coefficient(x.exponents()[0])
            1
            sage: f.coefficient([1,0])
            1
            sage: f.coefficient({x:1,y:0})
            1
```
