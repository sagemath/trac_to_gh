#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main `./configure` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  

**For use of Python packages: See #29023 Meta-ticket: In a python 3 build, use system Python packages**

* primecount (#25009)
* primesieve (#25009)
* pynac (#29542)
* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
* qepcad (#21783)

#### In Progress

The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:

* linbox (#29631)
* maxima (#32867)

#### Have tickets

The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:

* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle
  finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities;
  it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP
  in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can
  already use system's openblas, though (#27870), and we
  removed ATLAS in #30350.
* csdp (#31145, optional package)
* gap (using system GAP is desirable, but non-trivial, 
  especially now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
* jmol (#30316)
* lie (#32055, experimental package)
* mathjax (#30296)
* perl (#31839, script package)
* symengine (#32421, optional package)


#### No ticket yet

* bliss (optional package)

#### Use of  system Python packages

This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.

The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):

* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies

#### Testing infrastructure

- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

#### Meta infrastructure

- #31114 Add one file `build/pkgs/*/repology.txt` per spkg

#### Documentation

Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks. 

- #26668: add documentation for implementing spkg-configure.m4 and distros/ for spkgs
- #29018: improve documentation of m4/spkg-configure.m4
- #30543: Document spkg-configure.m4 and distros directory

#### Bug-fixing

A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

* #26715: build/pkgs/gfortran/spkg-configure.m4 works incorrectly if CC and CXX are already there
* #27219: have bootstrap fail gracefully if no pkg-config is available
* #27373: some dummy packages must be only re-installable via ./configure --with-...
* #27567: Add --with-system-<spkg> options to configure
* #27641: SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE macro: Add new pre-check and post-check optional arguments
* #27642: Re-run configure+make after installing an SPKG with sage -i

Should we find a better way to keep track of the distribution packages that provide what `spkg-configure` is looking for?

Something autogenerated from new per-package information `build/pkgs/*` that can keep the section in the installation manual current (`src/doc/en/installation/source.rst`) - last updated by Dima?

Related: #28745 (`environment.yml` for conda).

A good idea, I only don't know how exactly to implement this. E.g. on Debian one could
create a package with all dependencies (in fact, basically almost the same as their Sage package)
