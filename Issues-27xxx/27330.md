#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main `./configure` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  

**For use of Python packages: See #29023 Meta-ticket: In a python 3 build, use system Python packages**

#### In Progress

The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:

* linbox (#29631)
* maxima (#32867)

#### Have tickets

The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:

* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle
  finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities;
  it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP
  in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can
  already use system's openblas, though (#27870), and we
  removed ATLAS in #30350.
* csdp (#31145, optional package)
* gap (using system GAP is desirable, but non-trivial, 
  especially now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
* jmol (#30316)
* lie (#32055, experimental package)
* mathjax (#30296)
* perl (#31839, script package)
* symengine (#32421, optional package)


#### No ticket yet

* bliss (optional package)

#### Use of  system Python packages

This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.

The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):

* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies

#### Testing infrastructure

- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

#### Meta infrastructure

- #31114 Add one file `build/pkgs/*/repology.txt` per spkg

#### Documentation

Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks. 

- #26668: add documentation for implementing spkg-configure.m4 and distros/ for spkgs
- #29018: improve documentation of m4/spkg-configure.m4
- #30543: Document spkg-configure.m4 and distros directory

#### Bug-fixing

A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

* #26715: build/pkgs/gfortran/spkg-configure.m4 works incorrectly if CC and CXX are already there

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
 
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* patch (#24919)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* mpfr (#27258)
+
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* flint (#27264)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* readline (#27277)
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:
+
+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* pkgconfig
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* rw
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* iconv (common system package)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
 
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* patch (#24919)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* flint (#27264)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* readline (#27277)
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:
+
+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* pkgconfig
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* rw
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* iconv (common system package)
+* libgd (common system package)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+* cmake

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
 
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* patch (#24919)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)
+
+
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+* ecm (#27271)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* readline (#27277)
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:
+
+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* pkgconfig
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* rw
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* iconv (common system package)
+* libgd (common system package)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)

+* patch (#24919)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* cmake (#27487)

+* freetype (#27168)
+
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* readline (#27277)
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:
+
+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * scipy
+  * sympy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* pkgconfig
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* rw
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* iconv (common system package)
+* libgd (common system package)
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)

+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)

+* zlib (#26286)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* cmake (#27487)
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* flint (#27264)

+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* pcre (#27284)
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:

+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * scipy
+  * sympy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)

+* symmetrica
+* rw
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* iconv (common system package)
+* libgd (common system package)
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)

+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)

+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* cmake (#27487)
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)

+* pcre (#27284)
+* ninja-build (#27801)
+* rw (#27814)
+
+### Not Started
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet, although Dima has listed some sample config scripts for some of them:
+
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### Don't Have Tickets
+
+These packages are direct build dependencies of sagelib, and should thus take priority (since if these can be found on the system then one can presume that so too can their dependencies).  I have listed these roughly in order of the number of other *dependent* SPKGs these have.  Packages with more dependents should generally take higher priority as well:
+
+* python2/python3: this one is of course a very special case; while it should be possible/desirable to use a system python, any additional Python packages should optionally be installable into a virtualenv instead of the system site-pacakges, including sagelib itself unless the system *happens* to meet all of sagelib's Python dependencies already.  Listing some relevant Python packages below:
+  * cysignals
+  * cython
+  * ipython
+  * jinja2
+  * jupyter_core
+  * numpy
+  * scipy
+  * sympy
+  * pip
+  * setuptools
+  * six
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* pkgconfig
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* iconv (common system package)
+* libgd (common system package)
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)

+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie

+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* patch (#24919)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* pcre (#27284)
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)

+* readline (#27277)
+* libgd (#27825)

+* rw (#27814)
+
+
+### Not Started
+
+* iconv (#27823)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* libgd (common system package)
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* curl (#24919)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* mpir (#27212)
+* ninja-build (#27801)
+* patch (#24919)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* rw (#27814)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* mpfr (#27258)
+* mpc (#27259)
+* ntl (#27265)
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* readline (#27277)
+* libgd (#27825)
+
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* isl (#27864)
+* iconv (#27823)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* symmetrica
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* libgd (common system package)
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* isl (#27864)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* gc + libatomic (the 2nd is only used in the 1st)
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie

+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly

+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)

+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* curl (#24919)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* iconv (#27823)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* libgd (#27825)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* mpc (#27259)  - merged by #27822
+* mpfr (#27258) - merged by #27822
+* mpir (#27212)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* ninja-build (#27801)
+* ntl (#27265)  - merged by #27822
+* patch (#24919)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* readline (#27277)
+* rw (#27814)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* symmetrica (#28208)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* isl (#27864)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* lrcalc
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* lcalc
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+
+### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* curl (#24919)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)
+* gfortran (#24919)
+* git (#24919)
+* gmp (#27212)
+* iconv (#27823)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* libgd (#27825)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* mpc (#27259)  - merged by #27822
+* mpfr (#27258) - merged by #27822
+* mpir (#27212)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* ninja-build (#27801)
+* ntl (#27265)  - merged by #27822
+* patch (#24919)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* readline (#27277)
+* rw (#27814)
+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+
+* flint (#27264)
+* arb (#27270)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* symmetrica (#28208)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* isl (#27864)
+* lcalc (#28224)
+* lrcalc (#28231)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+
+* pari + cypari (these two are deeply intwined)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* m4ri + m4rie
+* glpk
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+* symmetrica (#28208)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* isl (#27864)
+* lcalc (#28224)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* pari (#28242)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+* singular

+* givaro
+* ecl
+* iml
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* eclib
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima

+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st

+* bliss
+* cypari (depends on pari)

+* iml
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding

+Other high priority packages:

+* ecl
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding

+Other high priority packages:

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.

+### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* lcalc (#28224)
+* glpk (#28459)
+
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* nauty
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+* singular
+* gsl
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+* r (getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+* numpy
+* scipy
+
+
+---
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
+
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* curl (#24919)
+* eclib (#28333)

+* ncurses (#27277)

+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gsl (#28879)
+* BLAS (openblas / atlas / etc): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity)  (#27870)
+* r (#28884) (alternative view: getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* cliquer (#28885)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* nauty
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+* numpy
+* scipy
+
+
+---
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed
+
+* #28409
+* #28401
+* #28405

+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:

+* patch (#24919)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* r (#28884) (alternative view: getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gsl (#28879)
+* cliquer (#28885)
+
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* cddlib (#28905)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* nauty
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+* numpy
+* scipy
+
+
+---
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

+
+* cbc (#28908)

+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc + libatomic (#28045) the 2nd is only used in the 1st
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* python2/3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* planarity
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+* numpy
+* scipy
+
+

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.

A good idea, I only don't know how exactly to implement this. E.g. on Debian one could
create a package with all dependencies (in fact, basically almost the same as their Sage package)

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* sqlite (#29002)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* planarity (#29063)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+

+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)

+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* sqlite (#29002)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* planarity (#29063)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* boost_cropped / boost (many systems should already have boost headers available)
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed
+
+* #28409
+* #28401

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
+
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.  Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks.  The documentation question is tracked at #26668.
+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)

+* xz (#26286)
+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* boost_cropped/boost (#29100) -- many systems have boost headers available
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed
+
+* #28409

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.

However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* boost_cropped/boost (#29100) -- many systems have boost headers available

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* fplll (#29245)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)

+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.

However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* boost_cropped/boost (#29100) -- many systems have boost headers available
+* bzip2 (#27182)

+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* brial
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* brial (#29369)
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* flintqs (#29430)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)

+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure

+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.

+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* flintqs (#29430)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* ppl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:

+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* fflas-ffpack (#29453)
+* flintqs (#29430)
+* ppl (#29454)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)

+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl
+* linbox
+* libhomfly
+* libbraiding
+* openssl
+
+Other high priority packages:
+
+* maxima
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+

+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* fflas-ffpack (#29453)
+* flintqs (#29430)
+* libbraiding (#29458)
+* ppl (#29454)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* iml (#27272)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl (depends on gc)
+  * maxima (depends on ecl)
+* linbox
+* libhomfly (depends on gc)
+* openssl (optional package)
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)

+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* fflas-ffpack (#29453)
+* iml (#27272)
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* gc (#28991)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* suitesparse (#29502)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+* singular
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap)
+* zn_poly
+* ecl (depends on gc)
+  * maxima (depends on ecl)
+* linbox
+* libhomfly (depends on gc)
+* openssl (optional package)
+
+All system Python packages, including the following, would be handled by #29023.
+
+* numpy
+* scipy
+* cypari (depends on pari)
+
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages

+**For use of Python packages: See #29023 Meta-ticket: In a python 3 build, use system Python packages**
+
+#### Already Done
+
+The following packages already have \`spkg-configure.m4\` checks that are working on most or all supported platforms:
+
+* arb (#27270)
+* boost_cropped/boost (#29100) -- many systems have boost headers available
+* brial (#29369) - see also #29490 - where it was disabled due to crashes on Fedora 30
+* bzip2 (#27182)
+* cbc (#28908)
+* cddlib (#28905)
+* cliquer (#28885)
+* cmake (#27487)
+* coxeter3 (#29721, optional)
+* curl (#24919)
+* eclib (#28333)
+* ecm (#27271)
+* fflas-ffpack (#29453)
+* flint (#27264)  - merged by #27270
+* flintqs (#29430)
+* fplll (#29245)
+* freetype (#27168)
+* gcc (#24919)
+* gf2x (#27238)

+* libatomic (#28045)
+* libbraiding (#29458)
+* libffi (#25900, #27114)
+* libgd (#27825)
+* libpng (#27186)
+* lrcalc (#28231)
+* m4ri(e) (#28342)
+* mpc (#27259)  - merged by #27822
+* mpfi (#28295)
+* mpfr (#27258) - merged by #27822
+* mpir (#27212)
+* nauty (#28958)
+* ncurses (#27277)
+* ninja-build (#27801)
+* ntl (#27265)  - merged by #27822
+* openblas (#27870)
+* palp (#29672)
+* pari (#28242)
+* pari's packages, apart from pari_jupyter (#28242)
+* patch (#24919)
+* pcre (#27284)
+* perl_term_readline_gnu (#27795)
+* pkgconf (#27827)
+* planarity (#29063)
+* ppl (#29454)
+* python3 (#27824) this one is of course a very special case; see the ticket for details.
+* r (#28884) (alternative view: getting R from the system has been desirable for a long time and will require more than just an \`spkg-configure.m4\`; see #25503)
+* readline (#27277)
+* rw (#27814)
+* sqlite (#29002)
+* suitesparse (#29502)
+* symmetrica (#28208)
+* sympow (#29673)

+* yasm (#24919)
+* zeromq (#26286)
+* zlib (#26286)
+* zn_poly (#29649)
+
+
+
+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* gc (#28991)
+* libhomfly (depends on gc) (#29630)
+
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* ecl (depends on gc)
+  * maxima (depends on ecl) (#29617)
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
+* giac (#29541)
+* linbox (#29631)
+* lrslib (#27804)
+* pynac (#29542)
+* singular (#29024; dup: #29515)
+* mathjax (#30296)
+* jmol (#30316)
+* 
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+* openssl (optional package)
+
+#### Use of  system Python packages
+
+This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.
+
+The following is an exception (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):
+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.

+#### Use of  system Python packages
+
+This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.

+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.

+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+* ecl (depends on gc)
+  * maxima (depends on ecl) (#29617)
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
+* linbox (#29631)
+* lrslib (#27804, optional package)
+* pynac (#29542)
+* singular (#29024; dup: #29515)
+* mathjax (#30296)
+* jmol (#30316)
+* qepcad (#21783)
+* 4ti2 (#30887, optional package)
+* csdp (#31145, optional package)
+* qhull (#31161, optional package)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+
+#### Use of  system Python packages
+
+This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.
+
+The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):
+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Meta infrastructure
+
+- #31114 Add one file \`build/pkgs/*/repology.txt\` per spkg
+
+#### Documentation
+
+Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks. 
+
+- #26668
+- #29018
+- #30543
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.

+#24919 implemented a mechanism for checking for checking for sagelib's direct and indirect dependencies at the time of running the main \`./configure\` script.  This was already done in an ad-hoc manner for a handful of packages (e.g. gcc, git, yasm, curl), but we wanted to be able to do the same for other packages, especially those that are common on Linux-like systems.
+
+This has now been implemented for many other packages, or is in the process of being implemented.  Those packages are listed below.  However, there are many others yet to be done, and this ticket will attempt to list them in some rough order of priority.

+The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):
+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies

+#### In Progress
+
+The following packages have in-progress tickets to provide configure-time detection on the system:
+
+* qhull (#31161)
+* singular (#29024; dup: #29515)
+
+
+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+
+* maxima (#29617)
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
+* lie (#32055)
+* linbox (#29631)
+* pynac (#29542)
+* mathjax (#30296)
+* jmol (#30316)
+* 4ti2 (#30887, optional package)
+* csdp (#31145, optional package)
+* symengine (#32421)
+
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+
+#### Use of  system Python packages
+
+This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.
+
+The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):
+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Meta infrastructure
+
+- #31114 Add one file \`build/pkgs/*/repology.txt\` per spkg
+
+#### Documentation
+
+Unfortunately there is still not good documentation for how to implement these configure-time dependency checks. 
+
+- #26668
+- #29018
+- #30543
+
+#### Bug-fixing
+
+A number of bugs/deficiencies has been uncovered in spkg-configure.m4 files and related configuration, and a number of tickets opened/closed

+
+#### Have Tickets
+
+The following packages have tickets for their conversions, but don't have working prototypes (i.e. branches) yet:
+
+* BLAS (atlas and other non-openblas): resolving how to handle finding a usable BLAS should be one of the highest priorities; it faces many of the same issues we faced with MPIR/GMP in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can already use system's openblas, though (#27870)
+
+* gap (using the system GAP is obviously desirable, but non-trivial, esp. now that we need a working libgap) (#29644)
+* lie (#32055, experimental package)
+* pynac (#29542)
+* mathjax (#30296)
+* jmol (#30316)
+* 4ti2 (#30887, optional package)
+* csdp (#31145, optional package)
+* symengine (#32421, optional package)
+
+#### No Tickets yet
+
+* bliss (optional package)
+
+#### Use of  system Python packages
+
+This will be be handled by #29023. Please do not add Python packages here.
+
+The following are exceptions (because it does not run in the same Python as sage):
+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies
+
+#### Testing infrastructure
+
+- #29053: Add debian/fedora package information to build/pkgs, generate Dockerfiles and installation help
+- #29060: Meta-ticket: Add Dockerfiles and CI scripts for integration testing of source and binary distributions and of downstream packages
+
+#### Meta infrastructure
+

+

+  in #27212, but perhaps with even more complexity). One can
+  already use system's openblas, though (#27870), and we
+  removed ATLAS in #30350.

+
+#### Use of  system Python packages
+

+

+
+* notebook (#30124), rst2ipynb, and their dependencies
