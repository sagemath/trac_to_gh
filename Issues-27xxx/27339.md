DiGraph.edges() fail for some examples because it try to sort but does not succed.
For example:

```
sage: g = DiGraph([(0,1,0),(0,1,'a')], multiedges=True)
sage: g.edges()
```

raise an error.
I suggest to remove the default value sort=True for this method to avoid this problem. Or, the exception raised by this sort could be catched and we return the list without sorting it if it is not sortable.


**EDIT**: the problem is everywhere

```
sage: g = Graph([(0,1,0),(0,1,'a')], multiedges=True)
sage: g.edges()

The problem is everywhere (I have edited the ticket description accordingly) and I'm surprised it has not been detected by any doctest...

It could be a side effect of recent changes in the coercion / richcmp model ?

I'm ccing many people because it seems a serious issue.
