<div id="comment:3" align="right">comment:3</div>

I found the reason.  It was for use with Hudson, apparently (specifically testing sage builds against cython devel): [#9828 comment:10](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/9828#comment:10)

Since we're not using Hudson anymore it clearly has no use.
