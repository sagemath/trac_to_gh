<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Well, this system's cmake is < 3.11, so in this case it "worked" in that it refused to use my system cmake.  I don't know how strict the 3.11 requirement is but I'm fine with leaving it for now.

I'll also test on a system with a newer cmake.

Are you still checking this? There is an extra complication here that cmake
keeps 3.x for long, issuing updates with numbers 3.x.y to them on a regular basis.
Perhaps it's better to go all the way to x big enough for the meaningful cases such as current cygwin etc.

Note: we upgraded to cmake 3.11.0 in #25109 because cmake 3.8.1 was
not enough to build primecount 4.3 (an optional package).

However, primecount 4.6 was released on 2019-04-13 and lowered the
requirement from cmake 3.9 to cmake 3.4, if I understand correctly.

To review: 

* pull the branch
* make sure Sage's cmake is not installed. (`make cmake-clean` should do the job)
* make sure you have `cmake` (version 3.4 or better) installed on the box.
* run `./bootstrap` (you nedd autotools, yes)
* run `./configure` and inspect its output - you should see that `cmake` is marked as `not installed)
* to make sure this all works, try it on #27662 (or some other cmake-dependent Sage thing)

As this branch merely adds an `spkg-configure.m4` file, there is no pressing need to have Sage's configure package updated. It will get in as soon as an update of the latter happens.
