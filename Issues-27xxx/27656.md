As reported in

- [Ask Sage question 46005: Issue printing tables in Jupyter Notebook](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46005/)

the following fails to display the expected table properly in the
Jupyter Notebook with the Python3-based SageMath kernel:

```
%display latex
rows = [('A', 'B', 'C'), (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
table(rows)
```

It works fine with the Python2-based SageMath kernel.

Observed with SageMath 8.8.beta1, on MacOS and
on CoCalc.

The table displays fine in text mode in the Sage REPL:

```
sage: rows = [('A', 'B', 'C'), (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5)]
sage: table(rows)
  A   B   C
  0   1   2
  3   4   5
```

```
A = ([1, 1], [3, 1], [-1, -1])

c = (10, 5)
P = InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm(A, b, c)

```
The `run_simplex_method` also calls `HtmlFragment`.
