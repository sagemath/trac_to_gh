I think not being able to use the most bleeding-edge version of a compiler is not such a blocker if it means forcing dependency updates that could lead to instabilities in other ways (in general being always at the bleeding edge lends some instability; as does falling too far behind).

In this case, at least, I haven't been able to identify any major problems with this openblas release, and it fixes all the problems i'm aware of from 0.3.5, which was a mess.

why does the error message mention 0.3.5 as the version number of the library which cannot be loaded?

and not 0.3.6?

A second issue, only present on one OS X machine so far:

```
sage: M = ModularSymbols(GammaH(13,[3]), weight=4)
sage: M.cuspidal_subspace()
Fatal: Memory exhausted.
```
This occurs with 8.8.beta7 + this ticket. For now, let's track both issues at #27961. If they need to be separated into two tickets, we can do this later.
