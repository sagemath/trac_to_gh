Continuation of #27230.

`sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename` tries to guess the location of a shared library. This broke tests on nix, even though the function is not even needed (since library locations are provided by env vars).

In contrast, `sage.misc.compat.find_library` seems to cover the same functionality but queries the system instead of trying to guess. It also provides a fallback through `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Is there any reason we shouldn't completely remove the `sage.env._get_shared_lib_filename` function?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
