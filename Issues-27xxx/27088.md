<a id='comment:4'></a>Thanks for adding this.  It is unfortunate that the FriCAS domain `SingletonAsOrderedSet` does not have an `InputForm`, which implies that `UnivariatePolynomial` and `SparseUnivariatePolynomial` also don't.  Maybe this will change at some point.

Anyway, currently you are not testing this:

```
sage: x = polygen(QQ, 'x')
sage: fricas(x+3)
x + 3
sage: fricas(x+3).domainOf()
Polynomial(Integer())
```

I think you want

```
sage: f = fricas("(y^2+3)::UP(y, INT)").sage(); f
y^2 + 3
sage: f.parent()
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Integer Ring
```

<a id='comment:7'></a>It doesn't quite work yet, but that may actually belong to a different ticket:

```
sage: fricas("(y^2+3*x)::UP(y, UP(x, INT))").sage()
...
NotImplementedError: The translation of FriCAS type (UnivariatePolynomial x (Integer)) to sage is not yet implemented.

sage: fricas("(y^2+sqrt 3)::UP(y, AN)").sage()
...
TypeError: Illegal initializer for algebraic number

sage: fricas("(y^2+sqrt 3)::POLY(AN)").sage()
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: Malformed expression
```

That's a bit strange, because I thought I have tested such constructions!
