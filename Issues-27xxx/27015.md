The code for computing all integral points on elliptic curves over QQ has bugs, some due to incorrect formulas in the literature.  For example:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('2082a1')
sage: E.integral_points()
[(-11 : 29 : 1), (-2 : 29 : 1), (4 : 11 : 1), (13 : 29 : 1)]
sage: E([507525709, 11433453531221, 1])
(507525709 : 11433453531221 : 1)
```
This curve has rank 1 and trivial torsion, generator P=(13,-43) and the integral points are k*P for k=1,2,3,4 and 13 (and their negatives).  We miss 13*P because the upper bound computed is only 12 (as seen with verbose=True).

#10973 implements integral points on elliptic curves over arbitrary number fields, and also provides a fix for this bug since it work over QQ (the branch at #10973 has the integral_points() method over QQ call the general one).  However the code there is slow over QQ (and relies on some incorrect though published assumptions).  Hence there is a case for fixing the bugs over QQ independently of the general implementation, and that will be done here.
