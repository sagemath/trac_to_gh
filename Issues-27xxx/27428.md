The function `acb_calc_func_callback` ends with a `sig_on()` statement. This makes absolutely no sense at all (see https://cysignals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interrupt.html#using-sig-on-and-sig-off). This was introduced in #24686.

In that same function, there is also a bare `except:` which should be fixed to `except BaseException:` (you really want to catch all exceptions, so it's better to be explicit about that).

Thanks for the notice. I think I'm unable to fix the issue by myself, unfortunately.

Is there a description of `sig_on()`/`sig_off()` that explains what they do and where the rules listed in the cysignal manual come from, instead of just saying what one should and shouldn't do? I don't remember the rule that “`sig_off()` should be called before the function that called `sig_on()` returns” being there when we wrote that code (but I may well have missed it).

What is the proper way to handle the case of (i) an external C library (ii) that performs callbacks into Python code (iii) but not very frequent ones, so that one would like the code running between two callbacks to be interruptible?

How old is your code? That piece of documentation dates from #10109 :-)
