As per my understanding this problem is arising because neighbor_out_iterator and neighbor_iterator methods are not able to return the iterator over vertices which are connected via multiedges they are only returning the vertices one time. I have looked into the graph backend files and couldn't find a function capable to return iterator over neighbors connected via multiedges.

As a solution to it I can write a function in backend capable of returning such iterator in case if the graph is multiedged that will be efficient too. (I found out_neighbors_unsafe method in sparse graph class which Gives all v such that (u, v) is an arc of the graph.) 
Alternatively, I can define an iterator myself in all_paths() function mimicking such functionality maybe by using edge_iterator to collect vertices connected via multiedges. I don't know which one is best. If there is any better ideas , I'll be glad to follow on that.

The neighbor iterator is doing exactly what it should. Even if you have 1000 edges between u and v, u has only 1 neighbor.

I think the easiest solution is:
- If the graph has multiedges, record the edge multiplicity
- Then, before yielding a path, compute how many time it should be returned (multiplication of # multiedges) and yield it than number of times.

For counting the edge multiplicity, I have a shorter solution:

```diff
         if self.has_multiple_edges():
-            edge_multiplicity = {}
-            for e in self.edges():
-                if (e[0], e[1]) in edge_multiplicity.keys():
-                    edge_multiplicity[(e[0], e[1])] += 1
-                else:
-                    edge_multiplicity[(e[0], e[1])] = 1
+            from collections import Counter
+            edge_multiplicity = Counter(self.edge_iterator(labels=False))
```
Try `Counter` to see how it works

For counting the multiplicity of path `p`, a more elegant version is:

```
m = prod(edge_multiplicity[e] for e in zip(p[:-1], p[1:]))
```
I don't know if you need to import `prod` from `sage/misc/misc_c.pyx`

Looking at the errors induced by this ticket in `src/sage/quivers/path_semigroup.py` and `src/sage/quivers/representation.py` (see the patchbot), I realize that we are making a mistake in this ticket and in #27504.

In graph theory, 2 definitions of paths are used:
1. ordered list of vertices `s=u1, u2, ..., uk=t` such that there is an edge from `ui` to `ui+1`
2. ordered list of edges `(s=u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (uk-1, uk=t)`

Most of the time, when we use the list of vertices, we care about the existence of an edge from `ui` to `ui+1`, and so we want only 1 path.
But when we use the list of edges, we are more interested in the existence of many paths due to multiedges.


So, if you agree, I suggest to add parameters to:
* switch on/off the use of multiple edges, if any, sets to off by default to avoid changing the behavior for methods calling this one. A possible name could be `multiedges`. I don't have a better name in mind yet
* return list of edges instead of vertices (possibly with/without edge labels). A possible name could be `report_edges=False`, combined with `labels=False`.


The main difficulty will be to build all the possibles paths with edges and labels...
There might exist some macro to ease this operation.

I see the underlying problem.

- switch on/off the use of multiple edges, if any, sets to off by default to avoid changing the behavior for methods calling this one. A possible name could be multiedges. I don't have a better name in mind yet 

I think use_multiedges might be a suitable variable...

- return list of edges instead of vertices (possibly with/without edge labels). A possible name could be report_edges=False, combined with labels=False. 

I was thinking this for a long time to output paths as edges using labels, even wanted to include in my proposal I think it can be done for now using something like Cartesian Product function by adding the edges using edge_boundary.


```
    path_with_labels = []
    for p in all_paths:
        multiple_path=[]
        for i,u in enumerate(p):
            if i < len(p)-1:
                v = p[i+1]
                edges = g.edge_boundary([u], [v])
                multiple_path.append(edges)
        path_with_labels.extend(CartesianProduct(*multiple_path))
```

If it looks ok then I can start adding it.

Great !

`CartesianProduct` is deprecated, so you must use `cartesian_product(multiple_path)` instead.

Calling `edge_boundary` is quite expensive. You should better store all edges between u and v in a dictionary. When it's done, do `mydict[v, u] = mydict[u, v]` so that cell `(v, u)` points to the list of cell `(u,v)`.

I'm still thinking to the logic of these parameters. I'm not fully convinced by the choices done like if `label is True` then set other parameters to `True`. 

Anyway,
- parameter `label` should be `labels`, as for other methods like `.edges(labels=True)`

- would you agree with the following changes in the documentation

```diff
-        - ``report_edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);  if ``True``, then
-          edges are used instead of vertices in representing the path else by
-          default vertices are used to represent the path
+        - ``report_edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to report
+          paths as list of vertices (default) or list of edges
```

```diff
-        - ``use_multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, then
-          multiple edges present between the nodes are taken into account for
-          finding all paths else these multiedges if present are ignored
+        - ``use_multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); this parameter is
+          used only if the graph has multiple edges. 
+
+          - If ``False``, the graph is considered as simple and an edge label
+            is arbitrarily selected for each edge as in 
+            :meth:`~GenericGraph.to_simple`
+
+          - If ``True``, a path will be reported as many times as the edges
+            multiplicities along that path (when ``report_edges = False`` or 
+            ``labels = False``), or with all possible combinations of edge labels
+            (when ``report_edges = True`` and ``labels = True``) 
```

```diff
-        - ``label`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);  if ``True``,
-          ``report_edges`` is automatically set to ``True`` and labels are
-          reported along with the edges. Also multiedges are also automatically
-          taken into account when label is ``True``.
+        - ``labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``False``, each edge is
+          simply a pair ``(u, v)``of vertices. This parameter is ignored when
+          ``report_edges = False``
```

- this is better

```diff
             for e in self.edge_iterator():
                 if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict.keys():
                     my_dict[(e[0], e[1])].append(e)
                 else:
                     my_dict[(e[0], e[1])] = [e]
-                if not self.is_directed():   
-                    my_dict[(e[1], e[0])] = my_dict[(e[0], e[1])]
+            if not self.is_directed():
+                for u, v in my_dict.keys():
+                    my_dict[v, u] = my_dict[u, v]

I had a little query

when use_multiedges=False but labels is True 

should I automatically make use_multiedges as True or 

should I output any simple path by choosing any label in case of multiedges as in :meth:`~GenericGraph.to_simple`

To better illustrate the combinations of parameter, you should better use a simple example. Your examples are quite complex I think

```
sage: g = Graph([(0, 1, 'a'), (0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2,'c'), (1, 2,'d')], multiedges=True)
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False)
[[0, 1, 2]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True)
[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=True)
[[(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=True, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'c')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'c'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False, report_edges=True, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False, report_edges=False, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=False, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'c')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'c'))]
```

I think that the results with `report_edges=False, labels=True` are very confusing.
For me, setting `report_edges=False` means that I want list of vertices, not edges, and so that I don't care of edge labels.
