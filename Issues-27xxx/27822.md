It occurs to me actually that we probably *can't* merge any of #27258, #27259, #27265 without this ticket: Due to the changes in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in` Sage won't build properly anymore without an updated `configure` script that makes the necessary replacements in that file.

Therefore, I believe the other tickets should just be closed, and only this one merged.
