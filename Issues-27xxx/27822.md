This ticket bundles together #27258, #27259, and #27265 in such a way that the configure tarball is updated to contain the configure changes from each of those tickets.

Once all three have been merged (or at the same time) this ticket can also be merged to bump the configure version.

**Updated configure**:

It occurs to me actually that we probably *can't* merge any of #27258, #27259, #27265 without this ticket: Due to the changes in `src/bin/sage-env-config.in` Sage won't build properly anymore without an updated `configure` script that makes the necessary replacements in that file.

Therefore, I believe the other tickets should just be closed, and only this one merged.
