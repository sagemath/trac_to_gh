This adds two new optional arguments to the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`.  Both are sets of actions that should be run unconditionally when running the resulting `configure` script, regardless of the outcome of checks for the package.

This demonstrates a use case for this in mpir, where no matter what else it is imperative to set a value for `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` (even if we are not installing the mpir SPKG, or the SPKG is already installed).

The follow-up ticket #27642 might make more clear why this is useful: If some SPKG is already installed we shouldn't bother checking for it on the system, so we skip the dependency checks.  But we may still want to perform other package-specific configure actions.

One thing I don't like about this entirely is that it would seem clearer and more logical to make the "pre" argument come before the other arguments.  However, since it's optional, and is not used for many packages, I thought it would be better to add it to the end of the argument list and not have to update every `spkg-configure.m4` to pass an empty value for the first argument.

The (currently) third argument is used in a few packages.  At least one example I can think of off the top of my head is yasm.  The point of the third argument is to check whether that dependency is needed at all for *anything*, as opposed to the second argument which assumes the package is required but does the check for whether it's provided already by the system.

I can try to reword it.

Essentially, yes.  It just allows insertion of commands into a couple places where it wasn't previously possible to insert them.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  It is used for #27642 which has this ticket as a dependency.

I mean to say, I'd like to see this ticket "in action", by itself it does not make much sense. How about reviewing once #27642 is done?
