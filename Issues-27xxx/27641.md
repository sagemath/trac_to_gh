# Issue 27641: SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE macro: Add new pre-check and post-check optional arguments

```
This adds two new optional arguments to the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`.  Both are sets of actions that should be run unconditionally when running the resulting `configure` script, regardless of the outcome of checks for the package.

This demonstrates a use case for this in mpir, where no matter what else it is imperative to set a value for `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` (even if we are not installing the mpir SPKG, or the SPKG is already installed).

The follow-up ticket #27642 might make more clear why this is useful: If some SPKG is already installed we shouldn't bother checking for it on the system, so we skip the dependency checks.  But we may still want to perform other package-specific configure actions.

One thing I don't like about this entirely is that it would seem clearer and more logical to make the "pre" argument come before the other arguments.  However, since it's optional, and is not used for many packages, I thought it would be better to add it to the end of the argument list and not have to update every `spkg-configure.m4` to pass an empty value for the first argument.

The (currently) third argument is used in a few packages.  At least one example I can think of off the top of my head is yasm.  The point of the third argument is to check whether that dependency is needed at all for *anything*, as opposed to the second argument which assumes the package is required but does the check for whether it's provided already by the system.

I can try to reword it.

Trying this with `./configure` leaves `gmp` not marked as an not to be installed, while `mpir` is marked as not to be installed.

Yes, I see the problem.  The change in `build/pkgs/gmp/spkg-configure.m4` is not correct.

Nothing in the "PRE" argument should set the `sage_spkg_install_<pkgname>`, and if the second argument (the one that's supposed to actually check whether or not to install the SPKG) is empty then it will force `sage_spkg_install_gmp=yes`:

```
m4_ifval(
 [$2],
 [AS_VAR_SET_IF(SPKG_INSTALL_VAR, [], SPKG_INSTALL_VAR[=no])],
 [AS_VAR_SET_IF(SPKG_INSTALL_VAR, [], SPKG_INSTALL_VAR[=yes])])
```

That's what's going on in the above lines in SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE
