```
This adds two new optional arguments to the `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`.  Both are sets of actions that should be run unconditionally when running the resulting `configure` script, regardless of the outcome of checks for the package.

This demonstrates a use case for this in mpir, where no matter what else it is imperative to set a value for `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY` (even if we are not installing the mpir SPKG, or the SPKG is already installed).

The follow-up ticket #27642 might make more clear why this is useful: If some SPKG is already installed we shouldn't bother checking for it on the system, so we skip the dependency checks.  But we may still want to perform other package-specific configure actions.

One thing I don't like about this entirely is that it would seem clearer and more logical to make the "pre" argument come before the other arguments.  However, since it's optional, and is not used for many packages, I thought it would be better to add it to the end of the argument list and not have to update every `spkg-configure.m4` to pass an empty value for the first argument.

Do you have an example use of the macro where the 3rd argument is not empty?
(Perhaps from one of the tickets on the list #27330 ?)

And, by the way, docs explaining them are hard to read, could you please instead write: 
"1st argument does this and this", "2nd argument does...", etc?

The (currently) third argument is used in a few packages.  At least one example I can think of off the top of my head is yasm.  The point of the third argument is to check whether that dependency is needed at all for *anything*, as opposed to the second argument which assumes the package is required but does the check for whether it's provided already by the system.

I can try to reword it.

I mean to say, I'd like to see this ticket "in action", by itself it does not make much sense. How about reviewing once #27642 is done?

Yes, I see the problem.  The change in `build/pkgs/gmp/spkg-configure.m4` is not correct.

Nothing in the "PRE" argument should set the `sage_spkg_install_<pkgname>`, and if the second argument (the one that's supposed to actually check whether or not to install the SPKG) is empty then it will force `sage_spkg_install_gmp=yes`:

```
m4_ifval(
 [$2],
 [AS_VAR_SET_IF(SPKG_INSTALL_VAR, [], SPKG_INSTALL_VAR[=no])],
 [AS_VAR_SET_IF(SPKG_INSTALL_VAR, [], SPKG_INSTALL_VAR[=yes])])
```

That's what's going on in the above lines in SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE
