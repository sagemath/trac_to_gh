Essentially the same motivation as in [[#27127 comment:3](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/27127#comment:3)]. The order in which vertices are visited is not always the same in py2 and py3, and so the order in which solutions are discovered may differ.

Here, with py3, we get `[[(-1, 1, 'a'), (-2, 2, 'b')], [(-1, 2, 'y'), (-2, 1, 'x')]]`. So same set of solutions than with py2, but matchings are reported in a different order, and the order of edges of each matching is different.

The proposed change is more stable with py2 and py3.

An alternative is to do:

```
sage: def compare(A, B):
....:     return Set(map(Set, A)) == Set(map(Set, B))
sage: G = Graph([[1,-1,'a'], [2,-2, 'b'], [1,-2,'x'], [2,-1,'y']])
sage: expected = [[(-2, 1, 'x'), (-1, 2, 'y')], [(-2, 2, 'b'), (-1, 1, 'a')]]
sage: L = list(G.perfect_matchings(labels=True))
sage: compare(L, expected)
True
```
Should I do that ?
