Several failing doctests were caused by the impossibility to sort of list of `Set` (already in Python2).

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation import vertex_separation, linear_ordering_to_path_decomposition
sage: g = graphs.PathGraph(5)
sage: pw, L = vertex_separation(g, algorithm="BAB"); pw
1
sage: h = linear_ordering_to_path_decomposition(g, L)
sage: sorted(h)
[{0, 1}, {3, 4}, {2, 3}, {1, 2}]
```
Since path decomposition is a graph whose vertices are `Set`, we get different results in py2 and py3.
=> we mark doctests as `# py2` and `# py3`.



Some doctests were due to a `max(None, <number>)`. With a proper initialization of the `cut_off` variable, we don't have this issue anymore.


Another doctest is fixed in #27027.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Hi !

I don't think all the `# py2` `# py3` are necessary.
For example for your two first modifications doing that :

```
sage: sorted(h.vertices(), key=str)
[{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}]
sage: sage: sorted(h.edges(labels=None), key=str)
[({0, 1}, {1, 2}), ({1, 2}, {2, 3}), ({2, 3}, {3, 4})]
```
give the same results in both py2 and py3.
