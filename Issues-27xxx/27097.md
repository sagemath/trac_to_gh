```
The method `IndexedFreeModuleElement._coefficient_fast` serves no purpose at all:

1. It actually makes `__getitem__` slower because of the extra indirection.

2. Special methods like `__getitem__` in extension classes are very fast already, as fast as Cython `cdef` functions.

3. When called from Python (not Cython), a special method is much faster than a method.

4. It is called in only one place (namely `__getitem__`), so even if it would be faster, its usage is dubious.

Since this is a private underscored method, we can just remove it without deprecation.

Furthermore, the implementation of `__getitem__` can be improved by only computing `self.base_ring().zero()` if needed.

Finally, in the category `ModulesWithBasis`, I am also removing `ElementMethods.__getitem__` because it doesn't seem to be used anywhere (to be checked by the patchbot).

This should do it:

sage: W.<x,y,z> = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(QQ)
sage: x[((1,0,0),(0,0,0))]
