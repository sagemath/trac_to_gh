Building a standard package with SAGE_CHECK=yes must work. If anyone can offer a different solution to this, without making `nose` standard, fine...

But please do not offer removing checks just cause you do not want to promote `nose`...

Volker did that.

But you don't like his solution, so you're discarding it. 

The use of `nose` was added at #26326, and that ticket description says quite clearly, "Note that self tests require `nose` which is optional only." So it's not like this situation is a surprise or was unintended when the self-tests were implemented. I would deduce that the intention was: if `nose` is present, use it, otherwise skip the self tests. Or maybe the intention was: most people don't run the self tests, and those that do can install `nose`. In any case, I don't agree that #26326 forces everyone to install `nose`.

A Dieselgate-style "solution" is not a solution. This is already merged, and let us not start track ticket wars caused by a 300K addition to Sage tarballs.

ISTM running the tests for networkx also requires scipy, so perhaps scipy should be a prerequisite dependency.

yes, this is a good catch. Should we do a quick gitlab fix?
