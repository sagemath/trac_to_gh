Volker did that.

But you don't like his solution, so you're discarding it. 

The use of `nose` was added at #26326, and that ticket description says quite clearly, "Note that self tests require `nose` which is optional only." So it's not like this situation is a surprise or was unintended when the self-tests were implemented. I would deduce that the intention was: if `nose` is present, use it, otherwise skip the self tests. Or maybe the intention was: most people don't run the self tests, and those that do can install `nose`. In any case, I don't agree that #26326 forces everyone to install `nose`.
