I think that the correct value for

```
acyclic_edge_coloring(Graph(3), k=None, value_only=True)
```
should be 0, since there is nothing to color.

As documented, this method computes by default a coloring of `G` into `\Delta(G) + 2` colors. So the result you get is at least consistent with the documentation.

For the same reason, we get the following: 

```
sage: acyclic_edge_coloring(graphs.PathGraph(2), value_only=True)
3
```

But we can check that a coloring with 1 color exists

```
sage: acyclic_edge_coloring(graphs.PathGraph(2), k=1, value_only=True)
1
```


The current implementation makes it impossible to return 0. So tests for small cases must be added.

I am very sorry, but I have to ask:

The documentation currently says:

```
    - ``k`` -- integer; the number of colors to use.

      - If ``k > 0``, computes an acyclic edge coloring using `k` colors.

      - If ``k = 0`` (default), computes a coloring of `G` into `\Delta(G) + 2`
        colors, which is the conjectured general bound.
```
Apparently, when `k` is larger than the acyclic chromatic index of `G`, the function still returns a list of `k` graphs, some simply do not contain any edges.

Here is a proposal:
