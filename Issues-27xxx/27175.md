libffi upstream hides headers behind ABI-specific directories. On gentoo this leads to failing ./configure checks for ffi.h, as
autoconf by itself is not aware of it. 
See e.g. https://bugs.gentoo.org/643582
for details. A fix would be to call
pkg-config in case of failing checks for the header:

```
$ pkg-config --cflags libffi
-I/usr/lib64/libffi-3.3_rc0/include
```
More precisely, the right `PKG_...` autoconf macro.

On the other hand, this might be a gcc gentoo bug, as on Debian the location is still not /usr/include, but something including `x86_64` in its name, yet the compiler finds the header just fine.
