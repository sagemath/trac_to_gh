This ticket is to upgrade to mpfrcx 0.5.

**Tarball**:

- http://www.multiprecision.org/downloads/mpfrcx-0.5.tar.gz

The upgrade fixes a problem with #27212, which does not work with mpfrcx 0.4.2.

We have not upgraded since introducing mpfrcx 0.4.2 as an optional package in #11806.


**CC:**  @slel @embray @kiwifb

**Keywords:** upgrade, mpfrcx
