This ticket is to upgrade to mpfrcx 0.5.

**Tarball**:

- http://www.multiprecision.org/downloads/mpfrcx-0.5.tar.gz

The upgrade fixes a problem with #27212, which does not work with mpfrcx 0.4.2.

We have not upgraded since introducing mpfrcx 0.4.2 as an optional package in #11806.


CC:  @slel @embray @kiwifb

Keywords: **upgrade, mpfrcx**

Seems like the Cygwin buildbot is in slightly better shape than I thought?  It is *building* successfully, but then when it gets to running the doctests, it bizarrely exits with error code 1 immediately:

http://build.sagemath.org/#/builders/37/builds/15/steps/8/logs/stdio

This despite being perfectly able to run the tests manually.  When run from buildbot it just fails immediately.

Sorry Eric, I thought that buildbot was there to catch when upgrades like this break things.

I'm going to test this locally ASAP but I don't think it's likely to cause any headaches.
