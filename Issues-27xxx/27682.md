Just to confirm: all 4 issues are now solved in sage (some of them had different traces inside of sage...).

and

```
$ sage -t *.py --optional=dochtml,e_antic,gfortran,memlimit,mpir,normaliz,python2,sage,pynormaliz
Using --optional=dochtml,e_antic,gfortran,memlimit,mpir,normaliz,pynormaliz,python2,sage
Doctesting 25 files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All tests passed!
