<a id='comment:12'></a>Few comments:

- Is there a reason for the H to be capitalized?
- The references should be placed in the references in the doc (see other files in polyhedron folder)
- "The group Z/2Z acts ..." could be math formatted
- Look at the conventions for docstring (example is the function vertex_facet_graph in base.py of the polyhedron folder). Further info here: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html

Then, one has to figure out how to integrate the code to the polyhedron class appropriately. I will address this in another comment.

In "_Hstar_is_effective_normaliz", you could avoid using flag and just return False as soon as you meet the condition. Then "return True" at the end.

Otherwise, patchbot is green, so this now needs a more mathematical review. I am afraid I cannot do that. Maybe Jean-Philippe can take the task ?

<a id='comment:64'></a>In the function `Hstar_function_normaliz` change

```diff
+        if perm == ident_perm:
+            pass
+        else:
+            raise ValueError("The conjugacy classes don't match with the character table")
```

To an AssertionError using an assert, it is better than ValueError.

I would not use a flag but simply write:

```diff
+        codim = self.ambient_dim() - self.dim()
+        for perm in conj_reps:
+            mat = group_dict[perm]
+            mat = mat.change_ring(Ring)
+            new_matrix = identity - mat*ts_matrix
-            if flag:
-                det = (1-t)**-codim*(new_matrix.determinant())
-            else:
-                det = new_matrix.determinant()
+            det = (1-t)**-codim*(new_matrix.determinant())
+            det_vector.append(det)
