This bug also appears in Linux (Ubuntu 19.04) in Chinese environment. In fact I suspect that this bug affects all non-western locale. 

It seems to be related to the encoding setting. For instance, if in sage/local/lib/python2.7/site.py, in the function setencoding(), we switch on the first if, then it gives the following error message on my machine:

```
[C 15:50:01.242 NotebookApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:
[C 15:50:01.242 NotebookApp] Could not decode '\xe6\x9c\xaa\xe5\x91\xbd\xe5\x90\x8d' for unicode trait 'untitled_notebook' of a LargeFileManager instance.
```

**Workaround**:

This is to be executed in addition to the modification in site.py mentioned above.

In the traitlets module (sage/local/lib/python2.7/sitepackages/traitlets/traitlets.py), track down the function `validate` in class `Unicode`, and modify it as

```
    def validate(self, obj, value):
        if isinstance(value, six.text_type):
            return value
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            try:
                return value.decode('ascii', 'strict')
            except UnicodeDecodeError:
                #msg = "Could not decode {!r} for unicode trait '{}' of {} instance."
                #raise TraitError(msg.format(value, self.name, class_of(obj)))
                return '!!!Decode error!!!'
        self.error(obj, value)
```

This modification suppresses the error raised when unable to decode a certain string. The problem should be reported upstream, to encourage a more graceful handling of decoding exceptions. After all, usability only degrades a bit with uncorrectly decoded strings, but raising an exception and failing is another dimension.

Since I observed that my jupyter notebook now has localized message (in Chinese) in it, I suspect that it is a bug introduced in upstream when they do localization.

I didn't see this ticket before; too bad.  This was also raised [here](https://github.com/sagemath/sage-windows/issues/28) and [here](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45052/sage-85-windows-jupyter-cant-work/).  It's a bug in Jupyter that [only affects Python 2](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/4166) so I think upstream has been loathe to do anything about it.

I would be willing consider including a workaround directly in Sage's Jupyter though, if need be.  In the meantime a simple workaround is to set (unfortunately) `LANGUAGE=en_US` in your environment before starting the Jupyter notebook.
