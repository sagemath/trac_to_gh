Since #27212 I get an error building sagelib:

```

```

followed by a long string of similar errors in the same module.

This is probably similar to the error fixed in #27713 but a different manifestation thereof.

This is partially fixed by the PR linked below, but then another related error arises related to flint and/or zn_poly abusing GMP type definitions:

Hmm, changing these ctypedefs to what I actually have in my `gmp.h` does not seem to fix it.  If my reading of the Cython docs is correct this actually should't matter anyways: It's still going to output literally `mp_limb_t` to the C code and does not redefine it in any way.

The "conflicting types" error first appears just after

```
/* Late includes */
#include "macros.h"
#include "string_impl.h"
#include "flint/flint.h"
#include "flint/fmpz.h"
#include "cython_metaclass.h"
```

so I wonder if one of these is somehow responsible.

I traced the problem to this line in `flint.h`:

```
#define mp_bitcnt_t ulong
```

I have no idea why it would do this, but it's almost certainly wrong.

Later it was changed to `#define mp_bitcnt_t ulong` in a mass rename.  But flint's `ulong` type is defined in terms of `mp_limb_t` hence the breakage.

Wow.  PARI has one of these too.  In `pari/parigen.h`:

```
#ifdef _WIN64
typedef unsigned long long pari_ulong;
#define long long long
#define labs llabs
#else
typedef unsigned long pari_ulong;
#endif
#define ulong pari_ulong
typedef long *GEN;
```

I think I encountered a problem caused by this `#define long long long` before.  I hate it.
