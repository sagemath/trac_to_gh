Since #23024, the docbuild will fail when it doesn't find pplpy's docs in `SAGE_SHARE/doc/pplpy`. We shouldn't hardcode this location. I have to patch this for nix, since the pplpy doc doesn't live under the `SAGE_SHARE` prefix.

I guess I can make it help with my own problems but that's hardly ideal. For my own problem that is. I approve of your idea in principle.
