It seems the compatibility of dimensions is not always tested
when multiplying matrices.

This ticket is opened following the report at
- [Ask Sage question 45547: Strange matrix product](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45547)

In particular, multiplying two 3 by 2 matrices should fail, but:

```
sage: A = matrix(QQ, [[1, 2], [-1, 0], [1, 1]])
sage: B = matrix(QQ, [[0, 4], [1, -1], [1, 2]])
sage: A
[ 1  2]
[-1  0]
[ 1  1]
sage: B
[ 0  4]
[ 1 -1]
[ 1  2]
sage: A*B
[ 1  0]
[ 1 -2]
[ 1  3]
```

In this case `A * B` amounts to `A.__mul__(B)` which ends up calling `A._multiply_flint(B)`.

For matrices over the integers, the multiplication above fails as it should:

```
sage: A = matrix(ZZ, [[1, 2], [-1, 0], [1, 1]])
sage: B = matrix(ZZ, [[0, 4], [1, -1], [1, 2]])
sage: A * B
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
IndexError: Number of columns of self must equal number of rows of right.
```
but we get a similar surprise by calling

```
sage: A._multiply_linbox(B)
[ 2  2]
[ 0 -4]
[ 1  3]
```

In case `_multiply_linbox` and `_multiply_flint` skip dimension tests for speed,
tests should be performed before calling them, which seems to be the case for
`_multiply_linbox` but not `_multiply_flint`.

Yes but use `self._ncols` (`Py_ssize_t` attribute) instead of `ncols()` (Python function).

Note that the coercion model raises `TypeError`

```
sage: Zmod(3).an_element() * Zmod(2).an_element()
```
and I think it is better to follow this convention.

This won't work, use

```
(<Matrix> left)._nrows != (<Matrix> left)._ncols
```
(note that since `left` and `right` have the same parent we want them to be square matrices)

Usually, no space between the type declaration `<Matrix>` and the name `left` or `right`.
