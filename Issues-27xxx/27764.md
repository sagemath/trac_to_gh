By default, TLS (aka Thread-Local Storage) is enabled in flint.
However, it contradicts to NTL configured without threads (`NTL_THREADS=off`), and in particular non-GNU linkers might refuse to link flint
(actually happens on FreeBSD). 

Also happens on macOS -- see for example https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/hobZzw74Rv0/VkAv7bG6DAAJ

We historically disabled threads in NTL because it relied on C++11 and we weren't on board with it for all packages and that was causing problems on downstream packages where c++11 wasn't on.

OK now that I see again what was done and that I remember the conversation let's move on a bit. There are two options

* enabling threads in NTL and letting flint do the same
* leaving threads disabled in NTL and applying this ticket

Is there any reason or platforms preventing us from enabling threads in NTL? We historically disabled threads in NTL because it relied on C++11 and we weren't on board with it for all packages and that was causing problems on downstream packages where c++11 wasn't on. This should be solved now. So is there another reason we cannot enable threads in NTL?
