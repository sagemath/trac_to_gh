By default, TLS (aka Thread-Local Storage) is enabled in flint.
However, it contradicts to NTL configured without threads (`NTL_THREADS=off`), and in particular non-GNU linkers might refuse to link flint
(actually happens on FreeBSD). 

Also happens on macOS -- see for example https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/hobZzw74Rv0/VkAv7bG6DAAJ

I have created ticket #29340 for this purpose. 
If someone wants to work on this (this requires fixing the problem with SIngular...),
I'll be happy to test it using the new [GitHub](GitHub) CI infrastructure.

 However, it contradicts to NTL configured without threads (`NTL_THREADS=off`), and in particular non-GNU linkers might refuse to link flint
