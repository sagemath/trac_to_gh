This ticket renames `abs` to `__abs__` for UniversalCyclotomicField elements.

With this, calling `abs(a)` calls `a.__abs__()`, which was not the case with `a.abs()`.

This is a follow-up to #26872 where `abs` should have been called `__abs__`.

See this report on Ask Sage and the comment there that #26872 did not fix the problem:

I checked that this solves the problem reported on Ask Sage:

```
sage: a = E(8)
sage: abs(a)
1
sage: v = vector([a])
sage: v.norm()

I think that this would be an excellent doctest to add.

Also: I prefer to see `abs(X)` instead of `X.__abs__()` in the tests.
