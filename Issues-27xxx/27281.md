<a id='comment:3'></a>Thought there was a notion of k-weak excedances that could be implemented as a method on permutations. After further reading, this is only a notion for decorated permutations, which will appear in a future implementation of positroids.

But there is still the minor fix that the method `weak_excedences()` should be `weak_excedances()`, which will be done in the next day as a tutorial.
