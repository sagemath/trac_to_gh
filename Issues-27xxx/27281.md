Thought there was a notion of k-weak excedances that could be implemented as a method on permutations. After further reading, this is only a notion for decorated permutations, which will appear in a future implementation of positroids.

But there is still the minor fix that the method `weak_excedences()` should be `weak_excedances()`, which will be done in the next day as a tutorial.

In fact, wiktionary thinks differently and mathematicians used all sorts of spellings.  More precisely:

* 'exceedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exceedance, Corteel, Sedgewick, ...
* 'excedance': https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/excedance, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation, Stanley
* 'excedence': Williams, Corteel, van Willigenburg, ... 

Although 'exedance' also occurs, I think that this probably is by exitand.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
