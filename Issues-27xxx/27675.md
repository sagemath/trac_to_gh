<a id='comment:5'></a>This should fix the doctests. A question about Python 3, though: in an interactive session, I see this:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: S.<a> = R.quotient(x^3-2)
sage: long(S(10))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-be7f7f725292> in <module>()
----> 1 long(S(Integer(10)))

NameError: name 'long' is not defined
```
But this (from `polynomial_quotient_ring_element.py`) passes doctests with Python 3:

```
            sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
            sage: S.<a> = R.quotient(x^3-2)
            sage: long(S(10))
            10L
```
In this ticket I've decided to mark that test as `# py2`, but it doesn't seem to be necessary, and I don't understand why. Any explanations? (I've confirmed that the test is actually being run.)

<a id='comment:7'></a>Here's the answer to my question: in `doctest/forker.py`, we have

```
    if six.PY2:
        extra_globals = {}
    else:
        extra_globals = {'long': int}
    """
    Extra objects to place in the global namespace in which tests are run.
    Normally this should be empty but there are special cases where it may
    be useful.

    In particular, on Python 3 add ``long`` as an alias for ``int`` so that
    tests that use the ``long`` built-in (of which there are many) still pass.
    We do this so that the test suite can run on Python 3 while Python 2 is
    still the default.
    """
```
I think we should clean this up: Sage's actual behavior should not differ that much from doctest behavior. (Not on this ticket, obviously.)
