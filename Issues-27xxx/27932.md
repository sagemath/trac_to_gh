This enhancement allows plotting of 3D vector fields. This is done by replacing the translated line segments of the field with 3D arrows at half the thickness of the lines. Since there is currently no way to turn off the arrow heads on the vector field, it is assumed they will be present.

Thanks for this improvement! The following example from the *Plotting 3D fields* section of the reference manual:

```
x,y,z = var('x y z')
g = plot_vector_field3d((x*cos(z),-y*cos(z),sin(z)), (x,0,pi), (y,0,pi), 
                        (z,0,pi))
show(g, viewer='threejs')
```
works but

```
x,y,z = var('x y z')
plot_vector_field3d((x*cos(z),-y*cos(z),sin(z)), (x,0,pi), (y,0,pi), (z,0,pi), 
                    viewer='threejs')
```
results in a Jmol plot, as if the option `viewer='threejs'` was not taken into account...
