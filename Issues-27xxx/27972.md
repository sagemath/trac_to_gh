Jeroen, will you be able to provide your alternative solution as a branch ? You seem to have less activity on trac, so I guess you have more urgent matters to handle.

Otherwise, maybe this could be done in another ticket ?

Not really "more urgent matters" but more "other matters".

I feel like the changes here make sense independently of the Cython patch: I believe that

```
sage: D = {1230981308409180310928308123: ZZ} # random large integer
sage: test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, ZZ, 1230981308409180310928308123)
```
will fail, while

```
sage: D = {1230981308409180310928308123: ZZ}
sage: test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, ZZ, hash(1230981308409180310928308123))
```
will work.

I don't object to testing whether small integers are equal to their hash values, but that  is tested in `integer.pyx`. After the changes here, the doctest still tests the appropriate function, and they also indicate how to use the function:

```
sage: D = {'a': ZZ}

That nothing happens if you give the *wrong* hash value. So basically the test relies on `hash(1) != 2`.

The second doctest relies on `hash(1) == 1`. Well, it doesn't rely on it, but if `hash(1) != 1`, then I think it is not testing what is intended.

And of course both rely on Sage Integers being valid hash values, which is what is fixed by the patch you posted to #27886.
