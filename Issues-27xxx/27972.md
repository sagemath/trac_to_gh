Not really "more urgent matters" but more "other matters".

There is a very simple workaround here, that makes logical sense for the tests (passing an object through `hash()` necessarily returns whatever the acceptable type for a hash is).  Let's just fix this without having to rely yet again on patching cython or whatever.

I feel like the changes here make sense independently of the Cython patch: I believe that

```
sage: D = {1230981308409180310928308123: ZZ} # random large integer
sage: test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, ZZ, 1230981308409180310928308123)
```
will fail, while

```
sage: D = {1230981308409180310928308123: ZZ}
sage: test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, ZZ, hash(1230981308409180310928308123))
```
will work.

I don't object to testing whether small integers are equal to their hash values, but that  is tested in `integer.pyx`. After the changes here, the doctest still tests the appropriate function, and they also indicate how to use the function:

```
sage: D = {'a': ZZ}
sage: test_del_dictitem_by_exact_value(D, ZZ, hash('a'))
