Jeroen, will you be able to provide your alternative solution as a branch ? You seem to have less activity on trac, so I guess you have more urgent matters to handle.

Otherwise, maybe this could be done in another ticket ?

Not really "more urgent matters" but more "other matters".

<a id='comment:18'></a>The second doctest relies on `hash(1) == 1`. Well, it doesn't rely on it, but if `hash(1) != 1`, then I think it is not testing what is intended.

And of course both rely on Sage Integers being valid hash values, which is what is fixed by the patch you posted to #27886.
