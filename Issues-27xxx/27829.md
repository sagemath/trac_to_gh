For large numbers (which don't fit in a Python 2 `int` anyway), you can replace `long()` by `int()`, for example

```
a = long(-901824309821093821093812093810928309183091832091)
```
becomes

```
a = int(-901824309821093821093812093810928309183091832091)
```
(unless the goal of the doctest is precisely testing `__long__` which is not the case here).

No, because we still have 

```
    if six.PY2:
        extra_globals = {}
    else:
        extra_globals = {'long': int}
```
in `doctest/forker.py`, so tests involving `long` can still pass with Python 3.

#27826 should be resolved first, and then this ticket afterwards.
