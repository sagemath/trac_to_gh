For large numbers (which don't fit in a Python 2 `int` anyway), you can replace `long()` by `int()`, for example

```
a = long(-901824309821093821093812093810928309183091832091)
```
becomes

```
a = int(-901824309821093821093812093810928309183091832091)
```
(unless the goal of the doctest is precisely testing `__long__` which is not the case here).
