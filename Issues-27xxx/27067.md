```
The method `is_isomorphic` for simplicial complexes doesn't work with Python 3 for several reasons. The method constructs graphs associated to `self` and `other` and then tests whether they are isomorphic, preserving edge labels.

- Some of the edges have labels and some don't, and this is not handled gracefully, so we give all edges labels.
- The vertices and/or facets in the complexes can't be sorted in Python 3, so we translate them all to Python `int`s, sort those, and then translate back if we need to.

Keywords: python3, simplicial complexes
