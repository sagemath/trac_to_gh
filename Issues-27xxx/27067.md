```
The method `is_isomorphic` for simplicial complexes doesn't work with Python 3 for several reasons. The method constructs graphs associated to `self` and `other` and then tests whether they are isomorphic, preserving edge labels.

- Some of the edges have labels and some don't, and this is not handled gracefully, so we give all edges labels.
- The vertices and/or facets in the complexes can't be sorted in Python 3, so we translate them all to Python `int`s, sort those, and then translate back if we need to.

I'm not sure I understand. Every vertex in a simplicial set must be in a facet, or to put it another way, the vertices in a simplicial set are formed by taking the union of the facets. (I'm talking about how things are implemented in Sage.) So if you have a vertex, you can't have the empty simplicial set. I can add this:

```
sage: S = SimplicialComplex()
sage: T = SimplicialComplex([0])
