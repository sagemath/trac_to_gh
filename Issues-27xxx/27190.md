```
In many (all?) of the combinatorial Hopf algebras implemented in [SageMath](SageMath), using the `__call__` method of a basis can be used:
* to convert from other bases;
* coerce from other algebras;
* create a basis vector from an element of the indexing set.

In `WQSym`, we would like to use either ordered set partitions or (packed) words as basis indexing set. A step in this direction was provided in #25913. But there is more work to be done if we wish to get the third feature above. This ticket aims to provide this feature.

Added `__call__` method and modified `__getitem__` method to provide the third feature listed in the ticket description.

I wonder: should we wait for resolution on #25916 (Packed Words)?
Then we could add these to the list of parents to watch out (see **line 135 ** of `wqsym.py` file in this branch.)

Some random timing results suggest**(?)** that the changes I've made hasn't adversely affected speed:

**Conversion:**

With changes in place:

```
            sage: M = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ).M(); C = M.realization_of().Cone()
            sage: %%time
            ....: for e in C.some_elements():
            ....:     #print e
            ....:     for f in M.some_elements():
            ....:         #print ' * ', f
            ....:         e*C(f)*f    ## products in Cone basis are computed via the Monomial basis.
            ....: 
            CPU times: user 19.9 s, sys: 60.8 ms, total: 19.9 s
            Wall time: 20 s
```

Without my changes (develop branch):

```
            sage: M = WordQuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ).M(); C = M.realization_of().Cone()
            sage: %%time
            ....: for e in C.some_elements():
            ....:     #print e
            ....:     for f in M.some_elements():
            ....:         e*C(f)*f    ## products in Cone basis are computed via the Monomial basis.
            ....:         e*C(f)*f
            ....: 
            CPU times: user 19.3 s, sys: 59.3 ms, total: 19.3 s
            Wall time: 19.4 s
```

**Comparing `__getitem__` to `__call__`:**

With changes in place:

```
        sage: %%time
        ....: for pi in OrderedSetPartitions(5):
        ....:     M(C[pi])
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 6.97 s, sys: 234 ms, total: 7.2 s
        Wall time: 7.27 s

        sage: %%time
        ....: for pi in OrderedSetPartitions(5):
        ....:     M(C(pi))
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 6.56 s, sys: 92.3 ms, total: 6.66 s
        Wall time: 6.68 s
```

Without my changes (develop branch):

```
        sage: %%time
        ....: for pi in OrderedSetPartitions(5):
        ....:     M(C[pi])
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 7.01 s, sys: 129 ms, total: 7.14 s
        Wall time: 7.12 s

        sage: %%time
        ....: for pi in OrderedSetPartitions(5):
        ....:     M(C(pi))
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 6.47 s, sys: 109 ms, total: 6.58 s
        Wall time: 6.54 s
```


**New feature:**

`__call__` for packed words is unavailable in develop branch:

```
        sage: PW = [pi.to_packed_word() for pi in OrderedSetPartitions(5)]
        sage: %%time
        ....: for pw in PW:
        ....:     M(C[pw])
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 6.74 s, sys: 109 ms, total: 6.85 s
        Wall time: 6.89 s

        sage: %%time
        ....: for pw in PW:
        ....:     M(C(pw))
        ....: 
        CPU times: user 7.14 s, sys: 54.8 ms, total: 7.19 s
        Wall time: 7.23 s
```
