This is a push to be able to use and doctest sage without SAGE_ROOT being defined. This is mainly useful for distro or if you import sage from python directly without running sage-env first.

* `sage/misc/persist.pyx` is dealt with in #27192
* in `sage/misc/citation.pyx` `SAGE_ROOT` is replaced with `""` but for all cases I have seen `SAGE_LIB` would be correct. I have only gone for `SAGE_LOCAL` in case something in `SAGE_LOCAL/bin` needs to be picked up.
* in `bin/sage-notebook` and `sage/misc/package.py`, `SAGE_ROOT` is imported but not used. So I removed it while I was at it.

This ticket doesn't deal with `SAGE_ROOT` used in `src/sage/misc/copying.py`.

Depends on #27206

Sure. I just removed it because I wasn't used. :-)

Sure, why not? It's cleaner that way.

This is an odd way to test for `None`:

```
        try:
            have_git = os.path.exists(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        except TypeError:
            have_git
```
What's wrong with

```
        if SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None:
            have_git = os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
        else:
            have_git = False
```
or even

```
        have_git = (SAGE_ROOT_GIT is not None) and os.path.isdir(SAGE_ROOT_GIT)
```

Why not

Well it seemed to me the pythonic way is `try:... except:` but I won't be religious on that and arguably it is not testing for `None` so yes, I could go back to the way I originally did it.

As for `python_executable` I'll admit I thought of removing it and ended up going with minimal changes.

I get a doctest failure in `src/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py`:

```
Failed example:
    os.getcwd() == DOT_SAGE
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```
The issue is that there is a trailing slash in `DOT_SAGE` but not in `os.getcwd()`. Does this come from `src/bin/sage-env`?

```
    # In theory, DOT_SAGE is not required to have a trailing slash.
    # But since there are some issues (#11924, maybe #12221),
    # we add a slash for safety.
    DOT_SAGE="${DOT_SAGE}/"
    export DOT_SAGE
```

Must be. `env.py`'s default doesn't have one and my own sage-on-gentoo `sage-env` defines `DOT_SAGE` without a trailing slash.

I think both issues are totally irrelevant now because of other changes. Although I will study #12221 because I have a issue with pari's testsuite in Gentoo's portage that may be totally related.

In this particular case I guess we need to make sure to "normalize" the path tested so it doesn't end up with a slash. Is there a python function for that?

I don't understand the comment in `sage-env` about #11924, since that ticket was explicitly trying to set things up so a trailing backslash would not be necessary. For this ticket I would just use `os.path.normpath`, but we should also (probably on a different ticket) try removing the trailing slash. I don't know the relationship between `src/sage/env.py` and `src/bin/sage-env`: do we need to deal with `DOT_SAGE` in `sage-env` if we set it in `env.py`?
