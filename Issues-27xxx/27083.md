It is a little suspicious because the `UniqueRepresentation` object `C` is deleted, so one would assume `C` should now be unreachable. Then `gc.collect()` is run, which should clean unreachable objects. So you'd expect after that to get a clean copy of `C` when it is recreated. But as you can see, it is not: it still has this `_dummy` attribute.

Testing creating and deleting these objects in a loop and then checking if any pile up on the heap using `gc.get_objects` doesn't give worrisome results, however. And when `WeakRefs` are involved it's actually possible to prevent `gc` from collecting everything in one swoop, so I agree there doesn't seem to be a memory leak.

But I think the report had some merit to it in that it pointed out suspicious behaviour that warrants a little further investigation (which found nothing).

Martin, it is *not* because of `UniqueRepresentation`. Although I am a little surprised that running `gc.collect()` a few times after deleting it is not leading to a new object being created:

```
sage: P = GF(3037000453)['x','y']
sage: P.dummy = True
sage: P.dummy
True
sage: del P
sage: gc.collect() # I ran this 5 times
sage: P = GF(3037000453)['x','y']
sage: P.dummy
...
AttributeError
```
Although in this example, it is not a `UniqueRepresentation` object, but I think it illustrates what should happen.

I am also wondering if this is related to #18426.

I only thought so because you can reproduce it also with other `UniqueRepresentation` instances.  For example:

```
sage: C = SetPartitions()
sage: C.dummy = True
sage: del C
sage: gc.collect()
sage: C = SetPartitions()
sage: C.dummy
True
```

There's a pretty clean example on the ticket #18426 you referenced above and which you reported. That's where I copied the code from when I tried. I actually made a mistake. There does seem to be some leakage, but it seems capped, oddly enough; like there's an LRU cache in place or so.

```
import gc
from collections import Counter
gc.collect()
pre={id(a) for a in gc.get_objects()}
for n in [2..600]:
  r = ShiftedPrimedTableaux([n,1], max_entry=2)
  r._dummy= True
del r
gc.collect()
gc.collect()
gc.collect()

T=Counter(str(type(a)) for a in gc.get_objects() if id(a) not in pre)
[t for t in T.iteritems() if 'Primed' in t[0]]
```
For me on 8.6, this finds 128 objects. And that number remains constant if I increase the bound 600 above.

Running this variant

```
import gc
from collections import Counter
gc.collect()
pre={id(a) for a in gc.get_objects()}
for n in range(1000,2,-1):
    C = crystals.Letters(['A',n])
    T = tensor([C]*n)
    del C
    del T
gc.collect()
gc.collect()
gc.collect()

T=Counter(str(type(a)) for a in gc.get_objects() if id(a) not in pre)
[t for t in T.iteritems() if 'letters' in t[0] or 'tensor_product' in t[0]]
```
results in

```
[("<type 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.Crystal_of_letters_type_A_element'>",
  624),
 ("<class 'sage.combinat.crystals.tensor_product.FullTensorProductOfRegularCrystals_with_category'>",
  32),
 ("<class 'sage.combinat.crystals.letters.ClassicalCrystalOfLetters_with_category'>",
  32)]
sage: sum(crystals.Letters(['A',n]).cardinality() for n in range(3,35))
624
```
So I agree, there seems to be some sort of LRU cache going on, but no real memory leak.

Actually, I have vague recollection of some sort of discussion about doing an LRU cache on sage-devel at some point, but I don't remember the outcome or details.

Replacing `ShiftedPrimedTableaux([n,1], max_entry=2)` with `SetPartitions(n)` I get `<class 'sage.combinat.set_partition.SetPartitions_set_with_category'>": 128`.

Perhaps the thread https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/lru/sage-devel/q5uy_lI11jg/kRWKxvCImwEJ from long ago is relevant?

Oh boy. It would seem that #24954 is responsible for this:

[unique_representation.py:1012 ](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6abcb72592dd3d288c68fe601756c9cbc96efe8b/src/sage/structure/unique_representation.py#L1012)

indeed it mentions a "128". So yes, there is no memory leak in the code, but after #24954 any test will indeed perceive a leak of something like 128 elements. In fact, with `crystal.Letters` there is apparently another implied construction, so we end up with only "64" elements.

This was exactly why I wasn't happy with #24954. It makes finding memory error that much harder. On the plus side: as this example shows, it does drive home the global nature of `UniqueRepresentation` elements a little more, and the fact that you shouldn't add or modify attributes on them.
