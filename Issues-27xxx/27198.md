I've never actually worked with matrices that big, and it could very well be that there is some kind of overflow in SharedMeatAxe.

```
I find the number of bytes-to-be-allocated interesting. It should allocate `pickle_size` bytes, and `pickle_size=FfCurrentRowSizeIo*self.Data.Nor`. We have `self.Data.Nor = 2^16-1`, and `FfCurrentRowSizeIo` should be the number of bytes needed to store one row. Since the field is relatively large, one item will be stored in a single byte, and thus I'd expect `FfCurrentRowSizeIo=2^16-1`.

Hence, the number of bytes to be allocated should be `4294836225 = (2<sup>16-1)</sup>2`, and that's far less than what the `__reduce__` method is trying to allocate.

The problem is not the assignment, the problem is the multiplication. You need to do something like

```
pickle_size = <Py_ssize_t>FfCurrentRowSizeIo * <Py_ssize_t>self.Data.Nor
```
(one of the two casts should be sufficient)

It works, but the size of data is so that my computer basically freezes.

Another question: The pickling does

```
            d = <char*>check_malloc(pickle_size)
            p = self.Data.Data
            x = d
            for i in range(self.Data.Nor):
                memcpy(x, p, FfCurrentRowSizeIo)
                sig_check()
                x += FfCurrentRowSizeIo
                FfStepPtr(&p)
```
which is basically copied from an upstream function that directly writes to a file (that's why pickling doesn't use that upstream function).

Then, it does

```
            pickle_str = PyBytes_FromStringAndSize(d, pickle_size)
            sig_free(d)
```

If I understand correctly, `PyBytes_FromStringAndSize` *copies* `d`.

Wouldn't it be better to use the above loop to directly write into a Python `bytes` using cpython functions, rather than creating a `char*` temporarily? But how?

Technically, yes that would work. But I think it's worse in terms of understanding what the code does: what is the meaning (to a human) of `cdef Py_ssize_t pickle_size = FfCurrentRowSizeIo`?

It's fine for me if you use a different variable name:

```
cdef Py_ssize_t row_size = FfCurrentRowSizeIo
cdef Py_ssize_t pickle_size = row_size * self.Data.Nor
```

I think it was an attempt to fix some compiler warnings concerning comparison of signed and unsigned types. Or it was because the original MeatAxe had int where it ought to be size_t, and I didn't change the types in my fork (yet), and I wanted to be consistent in the Sage wrapper.
