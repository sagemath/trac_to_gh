```
In `src/sage/misc/persist.pyx` the default picklejar location is set to `SAGE_ROOT/tmp/pickle_jar`. If sage is installed globally it is potentially a location where the user cannot write and in some sage-on-distro `SAGE_ROOT` may end up being undefined.

This kind of objects clearly belong to the end user and should be saved in `DOT_SAGE`.
