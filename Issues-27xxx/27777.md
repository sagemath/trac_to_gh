as the enumeration of set partitions should be constant. Maybe something is slightly different in the algorithm, but this needs a closer examination (that I do not have time for tonight).

<a id='comment:5'></a>In this case it looks like the difference of order depend on that :\\

py2

```
sage: sp = SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1])
sage: sp._set
frozenset({'a', 'b', 'c'})
sage: list(sp._set)
['a', 'c', 'b']
```

py3

```
sage: sp = SetPartitions(["a", "b", "c"], [2,1])
sage: sp._set
frozenset({'a', 'b', 'c'})
sage: list(sp._set)
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

The position of elements of `list(sp._set)` is used for generating `SetPartitions_setparts.__iter__` results.

Enumerating the linear extensions give me the same orders in py2 and py3: 

```
sage: P = sp._set_partition_poset()
sage: [e for e in P.linear_extensions()]
[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2]]
```

Why ? The sames elements are present in both lists.

<a id='comment:7'></a>That is a good catch, I missed that. It is also good to know that enumerating the linear extensions is the same. So that is where we need to fix things. In the `__iter__`:

```diff
-s = list(self._set)

It should be consistent because it is an enumerated set, so the unranking should be compatible.
