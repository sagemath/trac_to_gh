I am a little worried about multiple lazy_import resolutions of the designs stuff. I am wondering if it might be better to lazily import the whole catalog instead. Or do you think I am being paranoid or that we should take the more granular approach?

I think that I tried that first, and was forced to the current solution. I suspect that the line

```
from . import design_catalog as designs
```
may be preventing the lazy import. Let me try again.
