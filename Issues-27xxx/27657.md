Ideals of orders are often presented using more generators than needed.  For example, this snippet is taken directly from a test case in sage/src/function_fields/ideal.py:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ); R.<y> = K[]                                                                          
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x^3 - 1)                                                                              
sage: O = L.equation_order()                                                                                          
sage: O.ideal(x^2 + 1)                                                                                                
Ideal (x^2 + 1, (x^2 + 1)*y) of Order in Function field in y defined by y^2 - x^3 - 1                                 
```

The presentation is obviously non-optimal, since the ideal was created with a single generator, but printed with two!

A few little tweaks:

```
As `ALGORITHM` is not a standard Sphinx directive (cf. `.. TODO::`), so it should not be indented. Also, we prefer backticks over dollar signs.

Once this is done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.
