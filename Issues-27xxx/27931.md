Yes, I agree. Tried that yesterday while working on this ticket, and then gave up after an hour or so... (There were a lot of strange error messages, infinite recursion loops etc. That all not in `series.py` which worked perfectly, but in `species.py` and `generating_series.py` which I tried to adapt as well.)

Really?....my feeling was that storing zero in each element seems somehow a waste.

What if we store it in the parent and call it by `self._parent._zero_base_ring` or so?

 While I am not entirely sure this makes that much of a difference, it does seem to be called with some frequency, thus it might have some non-trivial effect. There is no real harm in having this (hidden) attribute IMO.

Getting this zero should clearly be done via the parent as it is not something that depends on the particular element.

This is just one pointer, so it is such a small thing in terms of memory for something that is used with some frequency by the element. So I think there is a benefit to doing this here. However, my suspicion is that this is not going to matter too much in terms of "real-world" computations. If you do put it in the parent with simple attribute indirections, then that is a good compromise. I don't have too strong of an opinion on this matter.

Because `zero` is a method of the parent:
