An interesting question is: how should the docs look like? Currently, in sagenb they are formatted as

```
        sage: @interact
        ....: def _(title=["A Plot Demo", "Something silly", "something tricky"], a=input_box(sin(x*sin(x*sin(x))), 'function'),
        ....:     clr = Color('red'), thickness=[1..30], zoom=(1,0.95,..,0.1), plot_points=(200..2000)):
        ....:     html('<h1 align=center>%s</h1>'%title)
        ....:     print(plot_points)
        ....:     show(plot(a, -zoom*pi,zoom*pi, color=clr, thickness=thickness, plot_points=plot_points))
        <html>...
```

This shows the code used to generate the interact, but it doesn't show the resulting widget nor the output of running the interact. It's not easy to do that since interacts are inherently graphical, so there may not be a sensible text representation (although in some cases, the *output* of an interact is textual).

So it's not *that* useful as documentation. I wonder if we can do better.

Does anyone understand the story of sagenb interacts vs jupyter interacts.
With the switch to Python 3, there is no sagenb available.

It appears that some code from sagenb is still used in jupyter interacts, though.

What I do know is that there is some small differences in functionality between Sage cell, CoCalc Sage worksheets (.sagews), Jupyter, and sagenb.  I have never seen a 100% reliable list of all such differences, though see #25387 for something related (not directly about interact).  See also #27752 for something annoying, and #27735 where at least one instance of less functionality in Jupyter got fixed.
