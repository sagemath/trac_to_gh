Ever since the upgrade to v0.3.5 of OpenBLAS (#27020) it has been impossible to get through the test suite on Cygwin without all processes eventually coming to a halt.  In particular this can be reproduced by running the test

```
$ ./sage -t src/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py
```

where for me it always stops exactly after line 3900:

```
sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3)
sage: o.skeleton_show([1,2,4])
```

though I suspect the problem has nothing specifically to do with that code.  When I run it by itself (even in a forked process) it does not hang.

It should be noted that the issue does not occur when I run that test with the `--serial` flag, so it is most likely yet another issue related to fork()-safety of OpenBLAS's multi-threading code (though I've yet to determine exactly what OpenBLAS functions are being run in this case).

I initially suspected that the problem might have been introduced by [PR #1875](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/pull/1875) in part just because any change introducing new concurrency primitives seems like a likely source of problems.  However, removing just this one change seemed to have no effect on the issue.

So now I am just bisecting between OpenBLAS 0.3.3 and 0.3.5 to see if I can narrow it down.

Possibly related:

Another bizarre issue I'm seeing in this module's tests is an apparent memory leak that gets introduced, deterministically, at line 3293 with 

```
    sage: o = lattice_polytope.cross_polytope(3)
    sage: o.npoints()
```

(specifically, it occurs after the `o.npoints()`).  Suddenly here the process's memory usage balloons from a couple hundred MB to ~3GB and never goes back down again.

It's really bizarre because there's no reason to suspect that code would cause such a ballooning in memory, and I can't reproduce the problem (even in a forked process) outside that very narrow occurrence in the test suite.  I'll have to see if I can put a break there and dig a little deeper into where exactly it's occurring...

Here's a straightforward way to reproduce the memory blow-up.  It happens immediately when the process is forked (the parent process itself blows up, and the child has the same large memory usage)., but only after running the following code:

```
sage: P2 = ReflexivePolytope(2, 0)
sage: PM_max, permutations = P2._palp_PM_max(check=True)
sage: PM_max.automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()
```

then do anything that forks the process (e.g. subprocess.Popen() with any executable).

It seems that the last line, `PM_max.automorphisms_of_rows_and_columns()` causes ~3GB worth of memory to be committed. In Windows terms this means that memory is guaranteed reserved for that process, though the pages are not actually created in RAM until/unless accessed.  The fork() necessarily reads in all these pages (even though they're clean, never used) this forcing them to be committed to be paged in.

In any case, this issue seems to occur regardless what OpenBLAS is in use, so I think it's not directly related to this issue, though it's possible it exacerbates it.

Per strace it appears to be hanging at, or near, an mmap call.  I wonder if this is something similar to #23973.  

```
  111 32811159 [main] python2 9608 mmap64: addr 0x0, len 262144, prot 0x3, flags 0x22, fd -1, off 0x0
 4245 32815404 [main] python2 9608 mmap64: 0x6F6C7F90000 = mmap()
```

I'll need to decode exactly what `prot` and `flags` those are:

    prot: 0x3 = `PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`, flags: 0x22 = `MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS`

so there's nothing too unusual going on there.

Indeed, there were definitely some shifting configurations and things between `git bisect` iterations such that I don't think everything necessarily got rebuilt that should have from change to change.  Normally just re-running `make` *should* have been good enough, but I think a few `make clean` may have been in order as well.
