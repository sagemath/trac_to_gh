The internal description of an element of QQbar can be quite complicated. To get some insights a method for showing this structure is provided.

The aim of this extension is to privide some good insight, on how a number/expression is built up. This is in particular useful if one wants to implement new features depending on this structure.

I don't think that starting to spoil all Sage classes with `_structure_str_oneline_` is a good idea. If you intend to start anything like that, there must be a debate on sage-devel.

On the other hand, many people already expressed their wishes to have integers printed as `ZZ:3` and rationals as `QQ:3` (or possibly `QQ:3/1`). This is somehow duplicating this possible feature.
