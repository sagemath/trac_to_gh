```
Subject to relatively easy to complete  #27212, #27258, and #27259,
every Sage toolchain part and dependency need not be built any more.

This allows moving the toolchain into a separate package, with 
parts seldom needed on sufficiently new Linux, Cygwin, and OSX+Homebrew (or whatever that comes with gfortran).

Package must be understood in sense of autotools (i.e. not a Sage package). Such a package can be built and installed somewhere, maybe with sudo, using a slimmed down Sage build system.
It won't need to be upgraded often, and not many people will even need it installed. In Sage itself, the corresponding to the moved there packages `spkg-configure.m4` files will still exist (perhaps merged into the main `configure.ac`).

Certainly, it would be able to accommodate more than the toolchain alone, but basically everything with `spkg-configure.m4`.
(Thus, perhaps a better name is `sage-prereqs` or something like this).

A "package" in the sense of a Sage package?

I'm -1 to this idea: by replacing clearly defined separate packages by one big package, you're making things more complicated rather than simpler.

I don't really understand which problem this ticket is trying to solve. If you really want to reduce some complexity, I suggest to review #27215.

The wheel is already there (it's called Sage). One basically just has to remove a lot of spokes, pythons, and other snakes from it :-).
The goodies it provides are in a prefix called SAGE_LOCAL.

And "incremental" is that the spokes etc may be added back, incrementally.

It's not outside the Sage project (or its grief, if you like) just because its tooling is what a lot of effort (and electricity) is spent on. And a lot of grief comes from the monolitic nature, which this proposal aims at reducing.

Sure, but we have to start the removal, yet, you cannot just remove without offering
continuity.

An early Sage 8.7 beta I tried to build on Homebrew (with more stuff from #27330 than currently merged) worked and passed all the tests on my old dying OSX 10.13 laptop.
It's basically done in the sense that no gcc/gfortran etc needs to be built on OSX.

Right. I think we both essentially want the same thing here in terms of end result.  Maybe just different ideas about the approach.  But it's hard to tell because it's not clear exactly what you have in mind.  What I want to do is just reuse what we already have, but make it easier to maintain in a separate source tree.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Sage toolchain is a well-defined subset of spkg's, with particularly convoluted rebuild rules (as some of them are dual-purpose, needed for building as well as for sagelib itself). 

It's a proposal to spin it out into a separate "mini-sage-the-distro",
which on systems with enough system packages will be basically empty. The remaining part of spkg's will be closer to pip-installable thing.

it should have its own prefix, so that different versions of sagelib can be used with it.

essentially, it'd be a "NanoConda".
