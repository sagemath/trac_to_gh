```
Subject to relatively easy to complete  #27212, #27258, and #27259,
every Sage toolchain part and dependency need not be built any more.

This allows moving the toolchain into a separate package, with 
parts seldom needed on sufficiently new Linux, Cygwin, and OSX+Homebrew (or whatever that comes with gfortran).

Package must be understood in sense of autotools (i.e. not a Sage package). Such a package can be built and installed somewhere, maybe with sudo, using a slimmed down Sage build system.
It won't need to be upgraded often, and not many people will even need it installed. In Sage itself, the corresponding to the moved there packages `spkg-configure.m4` files will still exist (perhaps merged into the main `configure.ac`).

Certainly, it would be able to accommodate more than the toolchain alone, but basically everything with `spkg-configure.m4`.
(Thus, perhaps a better name is `sage-prereqs` or something like this).

A "package" in the sense of a Sage package?

I'm -1 to this idea: by replacing clearly defined separate packages by one big package, you're making things more complicated rather than simpler.

I don't really understand which problem this ticket is trying to solve. If you really want to reduce some complexity, I suggest to review #27215.

I have thought of doing something similar, but not in the way you're describing.  What I would like to do, as I've written many times, is strip out *all* of the sage-the-distribution tooling from the main Sage repository, and make the actual sage repository just everything that's currently under `src/` and not much else.

There would be a base system for the tooling that makes up sage-the-distribution, including the components for building the toolchain itself (where necessary).  On top of that there would be an implementation of sage-the-distribution that is otherwise more-or-less the specific collection of SPKGs we have currently, including sagelib itself as an SPKG (see #27348).

That would be completely different from what you're describing here, but I think would achieve the same results.

I'm not sure this is worth the effort.  Why waste effort cobbling together our own gcc-and-friends toolchain rather than focus on just building on existing supported toolchains (e.g. homebrew, etc.)?  Who would this idea even be in service to except maybe some OSX users trying to build on Xcode?

What you describe is a non-incremental, or at least I don't understand how it is incremental.

And what I describe is pretty much incremental, and I don't see why it's much of an effort, as basically all the needed tooling for the toolchain is already there.
I agree that the main users of the separate toolchain would be the OSX users trying to build on Xcode (with a smaller population trying to build on old/weird Linux systems, for one or other reason, e.g. on HPC clusters).

The wheel is already there (it's called Sage). One basically just has to remove a lot of spokes, pythons, and other snakes from it :-).
The goodies it provides are in a prefix called SAGE_LOCAL.

And "incremental" is that the spokes etc may be added back, incrementally.

It's not outside the Sage project (or its grief, if you like) just because its tooling is what a lot of effort (and electricity) is spent on. And a lot of grief comes from the monolitic nature, which this proposal aims at reducing.

>  A technical debt we should work to remove/marginalize, not make more work out of. 

Sure, but we have to start the removal, yet, you cannot just remove without offering
continuity. 

> I *think* that's what you're trying to do in a way, but I think we're better off leaving that to other projects like Homebrew (I would be interested in trying to build Sage on Homebrew and make sure that works; I just don't know anything about Homebrew in the first place but am willing to learn).

An early Sage 8.7 beta I tried to build on Homebrew (with more stuff from #27330 than currently merged) worked and passed all the tests on my old dying OSX 10.13 laptop.
It's basically done in the sense that no gcc/gfortran etc needs to be built on OSX.

Sage toolchain is a well-defined subset of spkg's, with particularly convoluted rebuild rules (as some of them are dual-purpose, needed for building as well as for sagelib itself). 

It's a proposal to spin it out into a separate "mini-sage-the-distro",
which on systems with enough system packages will be basically empty. The remaining part of spkg's will be closer to pip-installable thing.

it should have its own prefix, so that different versions of sagelib can be used with it.

essentially, it'd be a "NanoConda".
