Multivariate polynomial rings have convenient monomial() method:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: P.monomial(2,3)
x^2*y^3
```
but there is nothing like that for univariate polynomial ring. This ticket enables:

```
sage: R.<z> = QQ[]
sage: R.monomial(2)
z^2
```

This is necessary for uniform programming for multivariate and univariate polynomial rings.
