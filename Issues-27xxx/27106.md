LGTM except (somewhat strangely) `tuple([foo for for in bar])` is faster than `tuple(foo for foo in bar)`:

```
sage: %timeit tuple([i for i in range(10)])
1000000 loops, best of 3: 798 ns per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(i for i in range(10))
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.24 µs per loop

sage: %timeit tuple([i for i in range(1000)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 30.1 µs per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(i for i in range(1000))
10000 loops, best of 3: 39.9 µs per loop

sage: %timeit tuple([i for i in range(100000)])
100 loops, best of 3: 3.95 ms per loop
sage: %timeit tuple(i for i in range(100000))
100 loops, best of 3: 4.62 ms per loop
```

So please revert those changes and then you can set a positive review on my behalf.
