Since cypari2-2 (#26442), the `__dealloc__` for `Gen` may cause deep (but finite) recursions, causing a stack overflow. This happens in particular on Cygwin which has a smallish stack by default (and maybe it also uses more stack space?) but it can be provoked easily on other systems too with

```
pari.allocatemem(2^28); L = [pari(i) for i in range(2^20)]; x = pari.Pi(); del L; del x
```

For reference, this is the test failure on Cygwin:

It turns out that CPython's "trashcan" mechanism was precisely designed to solve this problem. So we added support upstream in Cython for `@cython.trashcan` and then use that in cypari2. While we're at it, we upgrade to the latest Cython release

Are these problems reproducible? Do they occur when running the tests individually?

It would also be good to know the precise value of the pari stack size (`pari.default("parisizemax")`). Does changing the value of `sizemax` in `src/sage/libs/pari/__init__.py` affect the crashes?

It's completely reproducible and deterministic, at least when running the test suite.  I haven't tried putting together a simpler way to reproduce it.  But it was definitely introduced by #26442, and it's caused by an infinite recursion, apparently, in `remove_from_pari_stack()`:

This is essentially fixed upstream, both in Cython and in cypari2 (the latter is WIP but should be fixed soon).

The question is what should be done in Sage right now. I see 3 possibilities:

1. Do nothing for now and wait until a new version of Cython and cypari2 is released (the latter is easy since I'm the maintainer of cypari2).

2. Apply patches to both Cython and cypari2 in Sage.

3. Somehow work around the issue in a different way.

I prefer 2 since it properly fixes the actual problem. I believe that these patches are acceptable for distributions since they don't change doctest output of anything in Sage on Linux.

> On Linux (at least the laptop that I'm writing this on), the default stack size is 8MB. So either programs under Cygwin use much more stack or there is indeed something else.

Just to compare I compiled / ran this little program on Linux and Windows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>


void recurse() {
    static int depth = 0;
    char c;
    printf("recursion depth: %d; stack at: %p\n", depth, &c);
    depth += 1;
    recurse();
}


int main(void) {
    recurse();
    return 0;
}
```

The major difference, between minor calling convention details, is that on Linux the `recurse` function has the preamble:

```
  40052d:       55                      push   %rbp
  40052e:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
  400531:       48 83 ec 10             sub    $0x10,%rsp
```

whereas on Windows it begins:

```
   1004010e0:   55                      push   %rbp
   1004010e1:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
   1004010e4:   48 83 ec 30             sub    $0x30,%rsp
```

where the extra 32 bytes reserved on the stack are a requirement of the Microsoft x64 calling convention.  And indeed, when I run the program on both systems with the stack limit set to 2MB, the Linux version was able to get just a little over 2 times deeper before overflowing.

That's just a trivial example though; not sure exactly how the numbers shake out with `Gen.__dealloc__()`/`remove_from_pari_stack()` recursions.  I would think the difference would e less extreme in that case.

So, 32MB should have been more than enough, and yet it wasn't.  I'll try once more with 64 MB just out of curiosity, but then I'll check if it's something else that's wrong...

Okay, right. Increasing the stack size did appear to fix the crash in a few tests, such as

```
sage -t --long src/sage/rings/number_field/totallyreal.pyx
```

which now works, but did not with a smaller stack.

However, I'm still getting segfaults in `Gen.isprime` like

```
File "src/sage/libs/libecm.pyx", line 111, in sage.libs.libecm.ecmfactor
Failed example:
    N.is_prime()

      File "cypari2/gen.pyx", line 2077, in cypari2.gen.Gen.isprime
    SignalError: Segmentation fault
```

this appears to be a totally separate issue from the stack overflow issue.  Here's the "interesting" part of the stack trace.  I'll have to build a debug version of PARI to find out more:

I've confirmed to my satisfaction that this does fix the recursion depth issue with deallocations.  The `isprime` segfault persists, but appears to be orthogonal so I'll open a separate ticket for that.

I just want to do one run of the full test suite to ensure that no other new failures occur, but otherwise this LGTM.
