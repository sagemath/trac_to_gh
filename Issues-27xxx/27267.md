Since cypari2-2 (#26442), the `__dealloc__` for `Gen` may cause deep (but finite) recursions, causing a stack overflow. This happens in particular on Cygwin which has a smallish stack by default (and maybe it also uses more stack space?) but it can be provoked easily on other systems too with

```
pari.allocatemem(2^28); L = [pari(i) for i in range(2^20)]; x = pari.Pi(); del L; del x
```

For reference, this is the test failure on Cygwin:

It depends on what you mean by "subclassing is involved".  In this case subclassing *is* involved, as `Gen` is a subclass of `Gen_base`.

+It turns out that CPython's "trashcan" mechanism was precisely designed to solve this problem. So we added support upstream in Cython for ``@`cython.trashcan`, see https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2842

<a id='comment:26'></a>This is essentially fixed upstream, both in Cython and in cypari2 (the latter is WIP but should be fixed soon).

The question is what should be done in Sage right now. I see 3 possibilities:

1. Do nothing for now and wait until a new version of Cython and cypari2 is released (the latter is easy since I'm the maintainer of cypari2).

2. Apply patches to both Cython and cypari2 in Sage.

3. Somehow work around the issue in a different way.

I prefer 2 since it properly fixes the actual problem. I believe that these patches are acceptable for distributions since they don't change doctest output of anything in Sage on Linux.

> On Linux (at least the laptop that I'm writing this on), the default stack size is 8MB. So either programs under Cygwin use much more stack or there is indeed something else.


Just to compare I compiled / ran this little program on Linux and Windows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>


void recurse() {
    static int depth = 0;
    char c;
    printf("recursion depth: %d; stack at: %p\n", depth, &c);
    depth += 1;
    recurse();
}


int main(void) {
    recurse();
    return 0;
}
```

The major difference, between minor calling convention details, is that on Linux the `recurse` function has the preamble:

```
  40052d:       55                      push   %rbp
  40052e:       48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
  400531:       48 83 ec 10             sub    $0x10,%rsp
```

whereas on Windows it begins:

```
   1004010e0:   55                      push   %rbp
   1004010e1:   48 89 e5                mov    %rsp,%rbp
   1004010e4:   48 83 ec 30             sub    $0x30,%rsp
```

where the extra 32 bytes reserved on the stack are a requirement of the Microsoft x64 calling convention.  And indeed, when I run the program on both systems with the stack limit set to 2MB, the Linux version was able to get just a little over 2 times deeper before overflowing.

That's just a trivial example though; not sure exactly how the numbers shake out with `Gen.__dealloc__()`/`remove_from_pari_stack()` recursions.  I would think the difference would e less extreme in that case.

So, 32MB should have been more than enough, and yet it wasn't.  I'll try once more with 64 MB just out of curiosity, but then I'll check if it's something else that's wrong...

+It turns out that CPython's "trashcan" mechanism was precisely designed to solve this problem. So we added support upstream in Cython for ``@`cython.trashcan` and then use that in cypari2. While we're at it, we upgrade to the latest Cython release
