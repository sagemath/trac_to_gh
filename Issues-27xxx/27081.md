Currently, a `section` method for the class `FormalCompositeMap` is not implemented.
This ticket supplies a section in cases, where all factors of the composite map have `section`
implemented.

Examples which will be improved are:

```
sage: P.<x> = QQ[]
sage: P.coerce_map_from(ZZ).section() is None
True
sage: k = GF(47)
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(k)
sage: R.coerce_map_from(ZZ).section() is None
True
```

**Keywords:** section map

Sorry for letting my review of this take so long. Once these changes are done, then it is a positive review:

```diff
-        Compute a section map from sections of the factors of self if they have been implemented
+        Compute a section map from sections of the factors of
+        ``self`` if they have been implemented.
```

I would write this with short-circuiting and the reversal already built-in:

```python
        sections = []
        for m in reversed(self):
            try:
                sec = m.section()
            except TypeError:
                return None
            if sec is None:
                return None
            sections.append(m)

        from sage.categories.homset import Hom
        from sage.categories.sets_with_partial_maps import SetsWithPartialMaps
        H = Hom(self.codomain(), self.domain(), category=SetsWithPartialMaps())
        return FormalCompositeMap(H, sections)
```

Capitalize the beginning of the `.. NOTE::` in `polynomial_element.pyx`.
