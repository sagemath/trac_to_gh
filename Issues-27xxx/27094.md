1. For testing purposes: libGAP is not widely used, Sage is more or less the only serious user of it. If we find some problems now, it can be fixed before 4.10.1 is released.

2. Packagers always complains when Sage adds Sage-specific patches to a package. Now we replace these by upstream patches, which should be more acceptable for packagers.

3. Any work done on the Sage <-> libGAP interface in the mean time might break with the Sage patches. For example, I plan to do some work on improving the error handling and it makes much more sense to do that based on the official libGAP API rather than the Sage version of it.

Good points. The only reasons against it I could think of is 

- "the current patches are known to work" (which is outweighed by the benefits of testing the upstream patches) and 

- "potential additional packager work", which would need to be done after the next gap release anyways

Thanks for explaining your reasons.

gap-4.10.1 has been released on github (and there is a full gap distribution tarball with all the packages available) https://github.com/gap-system/gap/releases

But the release has not made it yet to gap website. It is probable that numerous page needs updating before going live.
