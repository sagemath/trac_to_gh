1. For testing purposes: libGAP is not widely used, Sage is more or less the only serious user of it. If we find some problems now, it can be fixed before 4.10.1 is released.

Good points. The only reasons against it I could think of is 

- "the current patches are known to work" (which is outweighed by the benefits of testing the upstream patches) and 

- "potential additional packager work", which would need to be done after the next gap release anyways

Thanks for explaining your reasons.
