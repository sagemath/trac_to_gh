shortest_path methods are also enhanced by adding exclude_vertices and exclude_edges parameter which are required for Yen's or improved Yen's algorithm. If some improvements are possible please let me know so I can improve the above method.

<a id='comment:8'></a>I'm a bit reluctant to the changes you did in `shortest_path` and `bidirectional_dijkstra` as it will slowdown these methods when `exclude_edges` and `exclude_vertices` are false. A significant effort has been put in optimizing these methods, so slowing them is not clever.

You must try to have the minimum possible impact on them. For instance do:

```
if not exclude_edges and not exclude_vertices:
    neighbors = nbr
else:
    neighbors = []
    for w in nbr:
        ...
```

you could also create `exclude_vertices_int` and `exclude_edges_int` to avoid code like
`(self.vertex_label(u), self.vertex_label(w)) not in exclude_edges`.


Is method `yen_k_shortest_paths` only for undirected graphs ?

<a id='comment:10'></a>I have made the changes in shortest_paths methods to have a minimal effect of exclude_edges and exclude_vertices.

yen_k_shortest_paths is for both the directed as well as undirected graphs as evident from the examples in the method.


```
            sage: g = DiGraph([(1, 2, 20), (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 30), (2, 5, 20), (3, 5, 10), (4, 5, 30)])
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 5, by_weight=True))
            [[1, 3, 5], [1, 2, 5], [1, 4, 5]]
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 5))
            [[1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 5], [1, 4, 5]]
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 1))
            [[1]]

            sage: g = Graph([(1, 2, 20), (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 30), (2, 5, 20), (3, 5, 10), (4, 5, 30), (1, 6, 100), (5, 6, 5)])

you were too fast. You still have `if not exclude_edges and not exclude_vertices:` inside the `for w in nbr:`. Also, check if the order of the other tests could be improved.

> yen_k_shortest_paths is for both the directed as well as undirected graphs as evident from the examples in the method.


The first lines of description are not clear. That's why I asked.

Plus it would be better to have a single line of description.

<a id='comment:19'></a>- In fact, `exclude_vertices` and `exclude_edges` could be any kind of iterable containers since we turn them directly to something else.

- You can do:

```diff
-        if exclude_vertices:
-            exclude_vertices_int = set()
-            for u in exclude_vertices:
-                exclude_vertices_int.add(self.get_vertex(u))
+        cdef set exclude_vertices_int = {self.get_vertex(u) for u in exclude_vertices}
+        cdef set exclude_edges_int = {(self.get_vertex(u), self.get_vertex(v)) for u, v in exclude_edges}
```

- You may also define `cdef bint exclude = exclude_vertice or exclude_edges` and then do a simpler test `if not exclude`...

- Note that the set of vertices and edges that you exclude is sometimes called `forbidden`.

- pep8

```diff
-            raise LookupError("No path between %s and %s" % (x, y))
+            raise LookupError("no path between %s and %s" % (x, y))
```
  in fact the error message could be `no path from/to an excluded vertex` or something like that.

- in Yen's algorithm, could you document the code
- I think that case `if not prev_path:` should be done before the while loop and that the while loop should be `while heap_paths:`.

The thing is that it will enter this if statement only once and that too at the start. So it can be placed outside the while loop but placing it inside seems to give a kind of structure and avoid redundancy as the part after if else condition(line 16097) will be redundant if it is placed outside the while loop so I place it inside the while(True) loop.

<a id='comment:35'></a>I am planning to include some new parameters like 

1.) include_vertices in shortest path functions

2.) reduced cost dictionary to shortest path functions

first one is for finding the all yellow node path in the graph as per the feng's algorithm since these number will be less as compared to exclude_vertices so this seemed a suitable parameter.

second one can be avoided but that will require to make a duplicate copy of the graph with the edge weights as reduced weights but not sure if it is good to make a copy of the graph is ok or not but using this parameter can help us in retrieving the edge weights.

Any suggestions on if anything above can be done in a better way will be helpful.

<a id='comment:39'></a>In **c_graph file** there are 2 new shortest path methods as a helper fn to yen's as well as feng's algorithm:

- bidirectional_dijkstra_special

- shortest_path_special

which can be moved to separate file or remain here whatever seems appropriate.

In **generic_graph** file :

- yen_k_shortest_simple_paths [original YEN] [completed]

- yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_directed [Feng's implementation]

  the feng's implementation is not fully completed yet there are few improvements and corner cases to be considered which I will be doing shortly but its still functional and can be tested.

<a id='comment:47'></a>**shortest_path_special**
- you could add a text explaining that this method is an extension of `shortest_path` enabling to exclude vertices/edges from the search

- add doctests

- `contatiner` -> `container`

-  the case `if x == y:` should depend on `distance_flag`: return either 0 or `[x]` (or `[]`). You can take the opportunity to correct other methods for the same issue

- assign default values to `exclude_vertices_int` and `exclude_edges_int`

**bidirectional_dijkstra_special**
- same comments as above

- I suggest to move the definition of the priority queue (`cdef priority_queue[...`) just before `pq.push(...`


I still have to review the implementation of Yen's algorithm. One concern is that these method should better fit in a new file gathering all methods related to the enumeration of paths.

Yes it is surely possible I guess. 
So should it be like a tuple of weight and corresponding path when report_weight is true?

I can add parameter like report_edges, report_weight as I did in all_simple_paths and all_paths method previously.

<a id='comment:62'></a>I performed the speed tests to compare the results of the original Yen's and the Yen's modified version i.e. Feng's which I have implemented under yen's shortest path_directed.


```
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: for i in range(120):
....:     g.add_edge(i,i+1,i%5)
....: 
sage: for i in range(30, 40, 1):
....:     g.add_edge(i,120,i%2)
....:     
....:     
....: 
sage: %timeit list(g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_directed(0, 120, by_weight=True
....: ))

100 loops, best of 3: 6.4 ms per loop
sage: 
sage: %timeit list(g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths(0, 120, by_weight=True))
100 loops, best of 3: 17.4 ms per loop

```

So I guess now I can merge both the methods (calling the second one inside the first if the graph is directed).

Also should I move the shortest_paths_special methods which are currently in c_graph.pyx inside a separated .pyx file.

- We should not expose `yen_k_shortest_simple_paths` to generic graph, but a front-end method, like `shortest_simple_paths` performing some tests and calling the right method. This method can have parameter `algorithm` to force the selection of the algorithm. Another choice could also be to extend `all_simple_paths`.

1. add parameters to methods `all_paths` and `all_simple_paths` in order to enumerate paths by increasing lengths / weights using weight functions (similar to what is done in shortest paths methods. You then call Yen / Feng when the parameters are appropriate
2. make a frontend method for `shortest_simple_paths`

May be the first option is enough, no ?


extra cythonization can be done after, possibly in another ticket as this one is already very big.

Problem  with first approach is that both the methods  `all_paths` and `all_simple_paths` return lists not iterator so it will change the functionality of these which I am not sure is a good idea. Also a common method for undirected and directed graph seems more better which is the second option. So I think second one is more appropriate.

I think you meant to import `_all_paths_iterator` in `digraph.py` .

The difference between `_all_paths_iterator` and `all_paths_iterator` is that former one takes single vertex as a starting vertex and latter one takes a list of starting vertices. These two methods were already present inside `digraph.py`. So if somebody was already using specifically `_all_paths_iterator` method can continue using since we have imported that method from path_enumeration.pyx to digraph.py otherwise the user will have to first import it from path_enumeration file. I am not sure if someone uses this method specifically, but this method also offers `simple` option if set to false useful for non simple paths. So maybe we can import it inside digraph.py module, so as to offer the same functionality as before.

I have gone through the changes you made and the methods and documentation has been improved a lot. Thanks for the review and it looks good to me.
