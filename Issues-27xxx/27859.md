This is the implementation of original yen's algorithm for k shortest paths which the method will return as an iterator. This will be compared with the improved yen's(Feng) algorithm which will be implemented shortly.

shortest_path methods are also enhanced by adding exclude_vertices and exclude_edges parameter which are required for Yen's or improved Yen's algorithm. If some improvements are possible please let me know so I can improve the above method.

I'm a bit reluctant to the changes you did in `shortest_path` and `bidirectional_dijkstra` as it will slowdown these methods when `exclude_edges` and `exclude_vertices` are false. A significant effort has been put in optimizing these methods, so slowing them is not clever.

You must try to have the minimum possible impact on them. For instance do:

```
if not exclude_edges and not exclude_vertices:
    neighbors = nbr
else:
    neighbors = []
    for w in nbr:
        ...
```

you could also create `exclude_vertices_int` and `exclude_edges_int` to avoid code like
`(self.vertex_label(u), self.vertex_label(w)) not in exclude_edges`.


Is method `yen_k_shortest_paths` only for undirected graphs ?

I have made the changes in shortest_paths methods to have a minimal effect of exclude_edges and exclude_vertices.

yen_k_shortest_paths is for both the directed as well as undirected graphs as evident from the examples in the method.


```
            sage: g = DiGraph([(1, 2, 20), (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 30), (2, 5, 20), (3, 5, 10), (4, 5, 30)])
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 5, by_weight=True))
            [[1, 3, 5], [1, 2, 5], [1, 4, 5]]
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 5))
            [[1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 5], [1, 4, 5]]
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 1))
            [[1]]

            sage: g = Graph([(1, 2, 20), (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 30), (2, 5, 20), (3, 5, 10), (4, 5, 30), (1, 6, 100), (5, 6, 5)])
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 6, by_weight = True))
            [[1, 3, 5, 6], [1, 2, 5, 6], [1, 4, 5, 6], [1, 6]]
            sage: list(g.yen_k_shortest_paths(1, 6))
            [[1, 6], [1, 2, 5, 6], [1, 3, 5, 6], [1, 4, 5, 6]]

you were too fast. You still have `if not exclude_edges and not exclude_vertices:` inside the `for w in nbr:`. Also, check if the order of the other tests could be improved.

> yen_k_shortest_paths is for both the directed as well as undirected graphs as evident from the examples in the method.


The first lines of description are not clear. That's why I asked.

Plus it would be better to have a single line of description.

<a id='comment:19'></a>
- In fact, `exclude_vertices` and `exclude_edges` could be any kind of iterable containers since we turn them directly to something else.

- You can do:

```diff
-        if exclude_vertices:
-            exclude_vertices_int = set()
-            for u in exclude_vertices:
-                exclude_vertices_int.add(self.get_vertex(u))
+        cdef set exclude_vertices_int = {self.get_vertex(u) for u in exclude_vertices}
+        cdef set exclude_edges_int = {(self.get_vertex(u), self.get_vertex(v)) for u, v in exclude_edges}
```

- You may also define `cdef bint exclude = exclude_vertice or exclude_edges` and then do a simpler test `if not exclude`...

- Note that the set of vertices and edges that you exclude is sometimes called `forbidden`.

- pep8

```diff
-            raise LookupError("No path between %s and %s" % (x, y))
+            raise LookupError("no path between %s and %s" % (x, y))
```
  in fact the error message could be `no path from/to an excluded vertex` or something like that.

- in Yen's algorithm, could you document the code
- I think that case `if not prev_path:` should be done before the while loop and that the while loop should be `while heap_paths:`.

I have made the container description as an iterable and made the improvements in c_graph file in the above commit.


I think the positioning of if not prev_path: is correct still I will check it, I will be documenting the Yen's code soon in my next commit.

Replying to [dcoudert](#comment%3A19):

> - in Yen's algorithm, could you document the code
 
Done

If any improvement is possible let me know.

> - I think that case `if not prev_path:` should be done before the while loop and that the while loop should be `while heap_paths:`.


The thing is that it will enter this if statement only once and that too at the start. So it can be placed outside the while loop but placing it inside seems to give a kind of structure and avoid redundancy as the part after if else condition(line 16097) will be redundant if it is placed outside the while loop so I place it inside the while(True) loop.

if by_weight:

heap_paths.add(hash_path) # adding the path to the heap_paths set

    hash_path = tuple(path1)
    ...
    prev_path = path1

I hv reverted back to set here as there can be multiple instances of same edges and vertices in exclude_edges and exclude_vertices.

I am planning to include some new parameters like 

1.) include_vertices in shortest path functions

2.) reduced cost dictionary to shortest path functions

first one is for finding the all yellow node path in the graph as per the feng's algorithm since these number will be less as compared to exclude_vertices so this seemed a suitable parameter.

second one can be avoided but that will require to make a duplicate copy of the graph with the edge weights as reduced weights but not sure if it is good to make a copy of the graph is ok or not but using this parameter can help us in retrieving the edge weights.

Any suggestions on if anything above can be done in a better way will be helpful.

I'm reluctant to add new parameters to the shortest path methods. The methods will become more complicated and difficult to maintain, and can be slow down.

An alternative is to create a new .pyx file dedicated to paths enumerations, and to put inside specialized shortest paths methods that are needed.

<a id='comment:39'></a>
In **c_graph file** there are 2 new shortest path methods as a helper fn to yen's as well as feng's algorithm:

- bidirectional_dijkstra_special

- shortest_path_special

which can be moved to separate file or remain here whatever seems appropriate.

In **generic_graph** file :

- yen_k_shortest_simple_paths [original YEN] [completed]

- yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_directed [Feng's implementation]

  the feng's implementation is not fully completed yet there are few improvements and corner cases to be considered which I will be doing shortly but its still functional and can be tested.

**shortest_path_special**
- you could add a text explaining that this method is an extension of `shortest_path` enabling to exclude vertices/edges from the search

- add doctests

- `contatiner` -> `container`

-  the case `if x == y:` should depend on `distance_flag`: return either 0 or `[x]` (or `[]`). You can take the opportunity to correct other methods for the same issue

- assign default values to `exclude_vertices_int` and `exclude_edges_int`

- `elif self._cg_rev is not None: # Sparse` add an extra space before `#`. This is pep8
- same for `# Dense`


**bidirectional_dijkstra_special**
- same comments as above

- I suggest to move the definition of the priority queue (`cdef priority_queue[...`) just before `pq.push(...`


I still have to review the implementation of Yen's algorithm. One concern is that these method should better fit in a new file gathering all methods related to the enumeration of paths. We could then let in `generic_graph`, and/or in `graph.py` and `digraph.py`, methods for selecting the algorithm to use.

Yes it is surely possible I guess. 
So should it be like a tuple of weight and corresponding path when report_weight is true?

I can add parameter like report_edges, report_weight as I did in all_simple_paths and all_paths method previously.

I performed the speed tests to compare the results of the original Yen's and the Yen's modified version i.e. Feng's which I have implemented under yen's shortest path_directed.


```
sage: g = DiGraph()
sage: for i in range(120):
....:     g.add_edge(i,i+1,i%5)
....: 
sage: for i in range(30, 40, 1):
....:     g.add_edge(i,120,i%2)
....:     
....:     
....: 
sage: %timeit list(g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_directed(0, 120, by_weight=True
....: ))

100 loops, best of 3: 6.4 ms per loop
sage: 
sage: %timeit list(g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths(0, 120, by_weight=True))
100 loops, best of 3: 17.4 ms per loop

```

So I guess now I can merge both the methods (calling the second one inside the first if the graph is directed).

Also should I move the shortest_paths_special methods which are currently in c_graph.pyx inside a separated .pyx file.

Can you suggest some ***directed graphs*** if you have any in mind? 

Or may be I can construct some graphs which maybe random or like a grid graph having many paths between 2 nodes?

Paley Graph

```
sage: g = digraphs.Paley(19)
sage: p = g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths(0, 18)
sage: %timeit [p.next() for i in range(1000)]

sage: p = g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths(0, 18)
sage: %timeit [p.next() for i in range(5000)]
1 loop, best of 3: 13.2 s per loop
sage: p = g.yen_k_shortest_simple_paths_directed(0, 18)
sage: %timeit [p.next() for i in range(5000)]

```

It can be seen directed_graphs algorithm by Feng's is indeed faster and our implementation is backing this fact.

In c_graph,

Since currently shortest_path_special and bidirectional_dijkstra_special are methods of CGraphBackend class.

I am not sure how to move them to a separate file.

Should I define the method declaration in C_graph and its definition in separate file or is there any other way round?

Good.

Can you do an extra test: check that you obtain the same paths. You have to be careful has the order in which paths are returned might differ.

Right. So let them in `c_graph.pyx`.

We have to choose a good name for the new file. So far I have only in mind `shortest_paths.pyx` but you may have better proposals.

I haved moved the yen's algorithms and all_paths and all_paths iterators to path_enumeration.py while still maintaining the mehtod definition to call them.

But the same examples and tests at two place seems to be redundant.

Also further this path_enumeration.py can be transformed to path_enumeration.pyx for further speed up.

As Feng is for directed graphs only and we already use it inside yen for directed graphs. And also the Sage function `all_paths` return the list of all the simple paths between src and target for unweighted graphs, so it should not be included as an algorithm if we plan to make `k_shortest_paths` kind of function. According to me it will be best to keep k shortest paths without any parameter algorithms and use yen for undirected graphs and feng's for directed graphs.

If you have any better idea let me know.

May be the first option is enough, no ?


extra cythonization can be done after, possibly in another ticket as this one is already very big.

Problem  with first approach is that both the methods  `all_paths` and `all_simple_paths` return lists not iterator so it will change the functionality of these which I am not sure is a good idea. Also a common method for undirected and directed graph seems more better which is the second option. So I think second one is more appropriate.

Can you build the doc without this ticket ? Try `make doc-clean && make`.

I think you meant to import `_all_paths_iterator` in `digraph.py` .

The difference between `_all_paths_iterator` and `all_paths_iterator` is that former one takes single vertex as a starting vertex and latter one takes a list of starting vertices. These two methods were already present inside `digraph.py`. So if somebody was already using specifically `_all_paths_iterator` method can continue using since we have imported that method from path_enumeration.pyx to digraph.py otherwise the user will have to first import it from path_enumeration file. I am not sure if someone uses this method specifically, but this method also offers `simple` option if set to false useful for non simple paths. So maybe we can import it inside digraph.py module, so as to offer the same functionality as before.

I have gone through the changes you made and the methods and documentation has been improved a lot. Thanks for the review and it looks good to me.

Right, it's in `digraph.py` and I agree it's safer to let the functionality.

There is something wrong. Feng and Yen should give the same results...

It was due to I forgot to update include_vertices as in above commit (took me a long time to realize that ;) )

I guess now its fixed.

```diff

```

This might be better

```diff
-        for j in range(dev_idx+1):
-            if j != dev_idx:
-                exclude_vertices.add(prev_path[j])

That was a good test case, I realized that I missed the part of Feng's algorithm where he mentions about removing the incoming edges of source and outgoing edges of the target node. But since it will be bad to permanently delete those things on our input graph that is why I created a copy of the original graph and worked on it.


```diff
+    G = self.copy()
+    # removing the incoming edges to source and outgoing edges from target as
+    # they do not contribute towards the k shortest simple paths
+    incoming = G.neighbors_in(source)
+    for i in incoming:
+        G.delete_edge(i, source)
+    outgoing = G.neighbors_out(target)
+    for o in outgoing:
+        G.delete_edge(target, o)
```

Now 

```
        sage: G = DiGraph('SL{Sa??B[??iSOBIgA_K?a?@H??aGCsc??_oGCC__AA?H????c@_GA?C@?A_?_C???a?')
        sage: s = set()
        sage: for i, p in enumerate(G.shortest_simple_paths(0, 1, by_weight=False, algorithm='Yen')):
        ....:     s.add(tuple(p))
        sage: t = set()
        sage: for i, p in enumerate(G.shortest_simple_paths(0, 1, by_weight=False, algorithm='Feng')):
        ....:     t.add(tuple(p))
        sage: s == t
        True
```
I see that copy function has parameters like sparse but not sure if we require to use it here.

Have you tried other random (di)graphs, possibly with multiple edges and various edge weights ?
For small graphs, you can enumerate all paths. For large graphs, you can for instance enumerate 100 or 1000 paths.
The more tests you do, the less bugs remains ;)

Currently both Yen's and Feng's ignores the multiedges present in a graph as shown thru below examples.

Considering this, for Feng's it may be a little bit difficult to handle, it becomes a little tricky when the graph is weighted and we want shortest paths according to its edge weights. As we have used exclude_vertices approach it may be diffcult to handle.
I think it will be better to handle this in another ticket but still during the gsoc period as #28220 is waiting for this tkt to be commited on top of it. Currently we can say its not implemented for multigraphs.

I think we are almost done here.

- use latex (twice)

```diff
-    Time complexity is `O(kn(m+nlogn))` where `n` is the number of vertices and
+    Time complexity is `O(kn(m+n\log{n}))` where `n` is the number of vertices and
```

- it might be nicer to do like that:

```diff
-        sage: g = Graph([(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (5, 6, 100), (4, 7, 3), (7, 6, 4), (3, 8, 5), (8, 9, 2), (9, 6, 2), (9, 10, 7), (9, 11, 10), (11, 6, 8), (10, 6, 2)])
+        sage: g = Graph([(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2),
+        ....:            (5, 6, 100), (4, 7, 3), (7, 6, 4), (3, 8, 5),
+        ....:            (8, 9, 2), (9, 6, 2), (9, 10, 7), (9, 11, 10),
+        ....:            (11, 6, 8), (10, 6, 2)])
```

- issue with corner case (Yen, Feng, etc.). I assume that when source=target and `report_edges=True`, we expect the empty path, and possibly a path with a loop if self loops are allowed

```
sage: g = DiGraph([(1, 2, 20), (1, 3, 10), (1, 4, 30), (2, 5, 20), (3, 5, 10), (4, 5, 30)])
sage: list(g.shortest_simple_paths(1, 1, by_weight=True, report_edges=True, report_weight=True, labels=True))
[[1]]
```

- if loops / multi edges are forbidden, you can start with `self._scream_if_not_simple()`. If only ignored, it must be clearly documented and you can use `G.to_simple(to_undirected=False, keep_label='min', immutable=False)` to reduce the size of the graph to consider. Currently, the weights are not smallest possible and not consistent with reported paths. 

```
sage: G = digraphs.DeBruijn(2, 3)
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.set_edge_label(u, v, 1)
....:     
sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
sage: for u,v in G.edges(labels=False):
....:     G.add_edge(u, v, 2)
....:     
sage: list(G.shortest_simple_paths('000', '111'))
[['000', '001', '011', '111'], ['000', '001', '010', '101', '011', '111']]
sage: list(G.shortest_simple_paths('000', '111', by_weight=True))
