#27256 did not fully fix the issue it was intended to fix.

I missed the fact that the `spkg-install` has two invocations of `make`, the first one being somewhat obscured within an `if` statement.

The second `make` attempt is only run if the first one failed (e.g. due to the target CPU not being well supported).

OK, I see `-DUSE_TLS` in the compiler output, so it works.

I do think that we should bump the package version since this is a functional change in the package.
