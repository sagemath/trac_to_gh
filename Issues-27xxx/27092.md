As reported at

- [Ask Sage question 45146: Bug in computing sum of binomials](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45136)

past versions of Sage had:

```
sage: sum(binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo, algorithm='sympy')  # correct
2
sage: sum(binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo)  # incorrect
3
```

The error can be traced back to Maxima as follows: evaluating

```
sum(binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo)
```
runs

```
from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_sum
symbolic_sum(binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo)
```
which calls

```
maxima_calculus.sr_sum(binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo)
```
which runs

```
from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import max_to_sr, maxima_eval, max_ratsimp, max_simplify_sum, max_sum, sr_to_max
args = [binomial(1, n), n, 0, oo]
max_to_sr(maxima_eval([[max_ratsimp], [[max_simplify_sum], ([max_sum], [sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in args])]]))
```

Indeed we can see the bug in Maxima's `simplify_sum`:

```
(%i1) load("simplify_sum");
(%i2) simplify_sum(sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,inf));
(%o2)                                  3
```

This was reported upstream as

- [Maxima bug 3521](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3521)

and Robert Dodier committed a fix in Maxima in Oct 2019.
