For some reason the official `sagemath/sagemath` images don't include `make`, which at a minimum is necessary for installing optional packages within the image (which should be considered essential functionality).

I think this should do it.

Some optional packages *might* require some additional system packages (e.g. some `-dev` packages), but most don't.  So those cases can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

I understand this of course. A couple years ago I would have been making the same argument, and in fact I think I even did have discussions like this with Nicolas where he and I disagreed, when I was first putting together my version of the Docker image for Sage.

In retrospect, however, many many users in the Sage community consider being able to run `sage -i` to be essential functionality, and indeed there have been many cases where not being able to do so was a huge hurdle (b.c. for example they would be teaching some topic-specific workshop that requires some optional packages, and people using the Docker images would be screwed).

It sucks to have to include some of the build toolchain in the Docker images in order to support this, but I would consider it essential, especially for the main "sagemath/sagemath" images.

Perhaps you could clarify the difference implied in `sage-dev`.

E.g. for the Windows distribution I strip out almost all build artifacts that are unneeded at runtime.  But so that `sage -i` has *some* chance of succeeding I added back in files like `configure`, `Makefile`, and the entire `build/` directory.  This adds very little to the overall package size.

Or do you just want this for the docker images? I am not sure this is a good way forward as it means lots of maintenance & support to keep it working nicely. I think it would be much easier in the long run to just package things for conda and use that to phase out SPKGs eventually. You can still build conda recipes from source but most people will be happy to be able to just use binaries. The main missing bits here are some failing doctests and the missing cygwin build of conda but both could be fixed if someone focused on this for a while.\n\nMaybe this discussion should not be had here but on Zulip instead. Feel free to open a thread there if you want to discuss packaging further :)",

If it's small I would not mind adding it too much of course.

Then no build crud is necessary.  That's a way's off though.  Adding support for this would be relatively easy to code, but we'd need the additional infrastructure to build binary tarballs for optional packages and upload them to the mirrors. 

I see the point of this of course but it feels like [SageMath](SageMath) would not only try to be Gentoo (allowing to build from source everywhere) but now also Conda (allowing installation of relocatable packages.) Or do you just want this for the docker images? I am not sure this is a good way forward as it means lots of maintenance & support to keep it working nicely. I think it would be much easier in the long run to just package things for conda and use that to phase out SPKGs eventually. You can still build conda recipes from source but most people will be happy to be able to just use binaries. The main missing bits here are some failing doctests and the missing cygwin build of conda but both could be fixed if someone focused on this for a while.

Maybe this discussion should not be had here but on Zulip instead. Feel free to open a thread there if you want to discuss packaging further :)
