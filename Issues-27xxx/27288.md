For some reason the official `sagemath/sagemath` images don't include `make`, which at a minimum is necessary for installing optional packages within the image (which should be considered essential functionality).

I think this should do it.

Some optional packages *might* require some additional system packages (e.g. some `-dev` packages), but most don't.  So those cases can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

I am not sure that this is going to fix it. As I recall, the docker image has been stripped of too much already.

Have you already tried to test this?

I understand this of course. A couple years ago I would have been making the same argument, and in fact I think I even did have discussions like this with Nicolas where he and I disagreed, when I was first putting together my version of the Docker image for Sage.

In retrospect, however, many many users in the Sage community consider being able to run `sage -i` to be essential functionality, and indeed there have been many cases where not being able to do so was a huge hurdle (b.c. for example they would be teaching some topic-specific workshop that requires some optional packages, and people using the Docker images would be screwed).

It sucks to have to include some of the build toolchain in the Docker images in order to support this, but I would consider it essential, especially for the main "sagemath/sagemath" images.

Sorry for the late reply. If people need more than `sage -pip`, then they should use `sage-dev`. If that's not clear from the documentation, we should fix that. Otherwise, where do you draw the line? Should every `sage -i` work? Then you need `sage-dev` or am I getting this wrong?

If it's small I would not mind adding it too much of course.
