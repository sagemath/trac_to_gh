As it turns out, #27346 actually broke the FindStat interface.  We now have:

```
sage: findstat(914)                                          # optional -- internet
<repr(<__main__.FindStatStatistic at 0x7fbc3dc1ec10>) failed: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf6' in position 30: ordinal not in range(128)>
```


The reason is the following change, which was made for py3 compatibility.

It went unnoticed, because the doctests were marked `# random`...

Another problem is that rational numbers can be interpreted as lists, which confuses the interface.  For example,

```
sage: findstat([(la, la[0]/1) for la in Partitions(10)], depth=0)
```
fails with the cryptic message that there are more values than elements.

Alternatively, if you just want to test that `repr()` works, it suffices to add a doctest

```
x = repr(findstat(...))  # check that repr() doesn't raise an exception
```

I just tried.  This does work for `FindStatStatistic.__repr__`.  However, I then have to put an addtional check into `FindStatStatistic.references`, because this returns a `FancyTuple`, whose `__repr__` doesn't like unicode either.

It seems to me that having the check in multiple places makes it more brittle, but I am easy to convince.

(apparently, encoding `FindStatStatistic._description` is unnecessary, though)
