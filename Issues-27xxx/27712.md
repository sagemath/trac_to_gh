```
Differentials don't currently work right over nested function fields.  For example,

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(31))
sage: R.<y> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(y^2 - x)
sage: R.<z> = L[]
sage: M.<z> = L.extension(z^2 - y)

sage: K.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: L.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(x)
sage: M.space_of_differentials()(x)
d(y)

sage: z.differential()
(8/x*z) d(y)
```

Yet dz = 1/(2*z) dy, which isn't (8/x*z):

```
sage: 1/(2*z) == (8/x*z)
False
```

This ticket is spun off from #26993

The patch adds an explicit instance variable to `DifferentialsSpace` that specifies the base differential that all of the other differentials will be expressed relative to.

If possible, the base differential is the generator of the base rational function field.  If this is not possible (because that generator is not a separating element), then the generator of the next higher field is considered until a suitable base differential is found.

I'm wondering if some means should be provided for the user to set the base generator, say if they wanted to use d(y) instead of d(x) when both are suitable.  Then we might have two different `DifferentialsSpace`s attached to the same function field, with two different base generators.  It really should only affect how the differentials are printed.  I'm not sure how to do it, so right now I'm just leaving it the way it is, and no means is provided for the user to pick the base differential.

But it solves the problem - the example listed in the ticket description is added as a test case.

Brent, I refactored differentials module so that now basic arithmetic with differentials of arbitrary function fields is supported. I also tweaked your code a little bit to speed up.

If you are positive on my portion of the code, then you can set positive review.
