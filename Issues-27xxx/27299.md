In the lastest beta 8.7.beta4, the docker builds fail their self test. Namely we run make and then we time another run of make (after deleting some cheap build artifacts.) This second run takes 400 seconds since this beta.

Have there been any changes to sphinx that could cause this? For some reason we seem to be rebuilding most of the reference manual:
