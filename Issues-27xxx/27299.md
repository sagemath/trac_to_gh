In the lastest beta 8.7.beta4, the docker builds fail their self test. Namely we run make and then we time another run of make (after deleting some cheap build artifacts.) This second run takes 400 seconds since this beta.

Have there been any changes to sphinx that could cause this? For some reason we seem to be rebuilding most of the reference manual:

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
