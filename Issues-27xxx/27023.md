Désolé Frederic, I found some more (mistake in my regexp) at the same time you reviewed.  And now I have more questions:

* I didn't fix those in `pyx` files, is that OK or should I fix those, too?

* There are several occurrences of the same pattern with `TESTS:`, but I don't see any consequences.  Should I fix them, too?

I'm sorry, I guess this was stupid.

I figured that at least some of the bad `EXAMPLES:` blocks messed up the documentation, and I thought that `EXAMPLES: (some text)` was not correct.  And my editor did the rest :-(

So, I guess it's best if I undo all changes except those `EXAMPLES:` -> `EXAMPLES::` which are appropriate?
