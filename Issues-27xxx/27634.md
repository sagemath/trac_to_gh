This is very nice and thorough cleanup. Here are some comments from glancing
through the code (I'm currently compiling):

* You've added forwarding of arguments to `Decoder.connected_encoder()`. But
  this is semantically not what was intended with the method. For
  `decode_to_message`, the decoder must have a specific type of encoder in mind
  (which is, in many cases, the same as having a specific generator matrix in
  mind), and this method enables the user to get exactly that encoder. So the
  user should not be required, indeed allowed, to supply any arguments to that
  encoder. How would he know which ones to give? If a sub-class of `Decoder`
  uses an encoder with specific arguments forwarded to it, then that decoder
  class must override `connected_encoder` and return the correct encoder. The
  `_connected_encoder_name` is simply a shorthand which covers most cases.

  In short, I recommend you roll back this particular change.

* Since we're already modifying `_repr_` for Goppa code, let's add their field,
  i.e. change their representation to e.g. `[8, 2] Goppa code over GF(2)`.

* The documentation for `__eq__` is unhelpful. Let's change it into something
  like

  {{{
  Test whether ``other`` defines the same Goppa code in the sense that defining
  set and generating polynomial is the same.
  }}}

  And then under EXAMPLES document this surprising behaviour of equality:

  {{{
  Note that this check will be false if e.g. ``other`` represents the same
  linear code as ``self`` but not constructed as a Goppa code:

  sage: E = LinearCode(C.generator_matrix())
  sage C == E
  False
  }}}

  A similar caveat should be placed on several other code classes, actually. If
  you feel motivated to put those in, I'd be happy, but I'm not insisting ;-)

* I disagree with your abbreviation in the first line of the module doc of
  `grs_code.py`. Writing out "Generalized Reed-Solomon codes" in full is more
  helpful.

* The first line of the module doc of `hamming_code.py` should say "Hamming
  codes", plural.

* Module doc of `linear_code.py` second paragraph

   {{{
      (...) `n-k`-dimensional (...)  ->>  `(n-k)`-dimensional
   }}}

* In `linear_code.py`, I disagree with your abbreviation of the error message
  when using not registered encoders/decoders (around line 506). Your shorter
  error messages are much less helpful.

* I'm not sure I like `random_received_vector` and its friend. It is a very specific use case to add exactly `t` errors to a codeword, and for this I don't mind the user typing out a few extra lines by using the `StaticErrorRateChannel`, which also introduces him/her to the much broader concept of channels. Rather, I'm in favour of adding to the class/module documentation how to use the channels (though it is also in the coding theory tutorial)

  If you insist on those methods, `random_received_vector_and_codeword` could (should) be compactly implemented
  by using the `StaticErrorRateChannel` channel.

  The documentation of the `random_received_vector` functions should perhaps be 
  clarified by adding something like the following paragraph:

  {{{
  Note that even though the returned vector is assured to be distance exactly
  ``distance`` from some codeword in ``self``, it might still be closer than
  ``distance`` to another codeword if ``distance`` is more than `d/2`, where `d`
  is the minimum distance of ``self``.
  }}}

  Perhaps `random_received_vector_and_codeword` should be obtained by an
  optional argument to `random_received_vector` called `return_codeword =
  False`. Note that then the doc should have an `OUTPUT` block to describe the
  output semantics.

  The doc states that ``distance`` should be positive, but it should say
  "non-negative".

Best,
Johan

This behavior of equality check is common in Sage. I don't worry much. But I will add more examples if I feel motivated :-)

Right. Done.

Done.

I felt that it was too much verbose. The user should learn what the message says from the documentation.

But ok as I respect your wisdom. I recovered the original message. 

> * I'm not sure I like `random_received_vector` and its friend. It is a very specific use case to add exactly `t` errors to a codeword, and for this I don't mind the user typing out a few extra lines by using the `StaticErrorRateChannel`, which also introduces him/her to the much broader concept of channels. Rather, I'm in favour of adding to the class/module documentation how to use the channels (though it is also in the coding theory tutorial)


I added that when I was moving my code in Magma to Sage, without much appreciation of the channel concept myself. Now I see that `random_received_vector` does not fit well with the overall design of  the coding module.

I decided to remove it.
