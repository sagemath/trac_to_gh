I opened this ticket but we must wait for 8.8.beta4.

Note that I find `is_package_installed` much more natural than a `try:... except...` here, but if this method is not good, let's use something else.

There is nothing natural about `is_package_installed`. Which piece of software can you name that will call rpm or apt to figure out if some of their dependencies are installed? How portable do you think that is? `try:... except...` is a well accepted pythonism in other python software that don't have their own package manager to interrogate.

there is an error: it is `vertex_list` and not `vertexlist` in `v_to_int = {v: i for i, v in enumerate(vertexlist)}`.

We could also change `vertex_list = self.vertices()` to `vertex_list = list(self)`, but it is documented like that. So may be in a future ticket.
