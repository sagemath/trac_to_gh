<a id='comment:1'></a>I opened this ticket but we must wait for 8.8.beta4.

Note that I find `is_package_installed` much more natural than a `try:... except...` here, but if this method is not good, let's use something else.

Thanks for doing that. I should have done it myself and indeed we need to wait for the next beta.

There is nothing natural about `is_package_installed`. Which piece of software can you name that will call rpm or apt to figure out if some of their dependencies are installed? How portable do you think that is? `try:... except...` is a well accepted pythonism in other python software that don't have their own package manager to interrogate.
