I opened this ticket but we must wait for 8.8.beta4.

Note that I find `is_package_installed` much more natural than a `try:... except...` here, but if this method is not good, let's use something else.

There is nothing natural about `is_package_installed`. Which piece of software can you name that will call rpm or apt to figure out if some of their dependencies are installed?
