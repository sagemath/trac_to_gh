iml only works with MP_LIBRARY provided in SAGE_LOCAL, at least this is the case on Debian 9.

they have a very old autoconf macro to detect GMP, which it particular won't work for libgmp in some arch-specfic location such as /usr/lib64/.
 
This breaks #27212. It works with GMP provided by the system if I just remove the call to their macro, re-run their bootstrap, repackage tarball.

While we are at it, it makes sense to update iml to the latest version 1.0.5 (we are at 1.0.4).

It should also get spkg-configure.m4

The easiest fix would be to skip the iml's testing for MP_LIBRARY if we use the one from the system.

But how does one test for this? Is there a variable (provided by #27212) in the environment that can be tested?

So the problem I'm having with iml, at least on Debian, is simply the fact that for blas and for GMP it has some kind of overwrought non-standard macros for detecting them, that run into the same kinds of problems that led me to declare in the first place that I did *not* want to provide some mechanism to search for the exact path to the GMP shared object (as opposed to just trying `-lgmp` and seeing if it works as `AC_CHECK_LIB` and the like do).

Instead, iml's autoconf macros (see e.g. `config/gmp-check.m4` in the iml source) really wants to check the full path for the header files and libraries, and check that those files exist at some specific path.  To do this it has a list of default prefixes it checks in (`/usr` and `/usr/local`), which in the Sage `spkg-install` we also prepend `$SAGE_LOCAL` to with `--with-default=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

However, on Debian and Ubuntu which use a multiarch layout this fails: The default settings will not find the GMP headers and shared object under `/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu` and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` (for example) to use the system lib.

I was able to get iml to build in Sage with the system GMP by configuring it like:

```
./configure --with-gmp-include=/usr/include/$(gcc -print-multiarch) \
            --with-gmp-lib=/usr/lib/$(gcc -print-multiarch) \
            --with-cblas="$(pkg-config --libs cblas)" \
            --with-cblas-includes="$(pkg-config --cflags cblas)"
```

(for BLAS just using pkg-config works fine).

So I think the best thing to do, while annoying, is to simply pass the correct `--with-gmp-include` and `--with-gmp-lib` flags for the platform we're building on.  Which kind of stinks because in principle those could take any possible value.  In practice, however, for most systems it will be in one of just a few places, and I have some more generic code elsewhere I can integrate here that will work for most platforms.

In other words, we need some custom code here that works similarly to what iml's `configure.ac` is doing, but checks in a wider range of locations, including multi-arch directories where they exist, then pass the correct values for these flags.

I don't think that `IML_CHECK_GMP` will work if the compiler does not have `/usr/local/include` in its list of default paths, or the linker does not know about libs in `/usr/local/lib` without being supplied with the `-L` pointing there---something that might be the case on *BSD (and our favourite, OSX :-))

It might be easier just to replace it by something that works in all cases.

<a id='comment:20'></a>
To be clear what I meant, on FreeBSD, where GMP lives in `/usr/local`,  to make IML's configure to pass GMP checks, I need to do

```
CC="cc -I/usr/local/include" ./configure 
```
as without setting `CC` this way  it fails with

```
Default checking path = /usr /usr/local
checking for GMP >= 3.1.1... not found
configure: error: GMP not found!
GMP version 3.1.1 or greater is required for this library to compile.
Please make sure GMP is installed and specify the header and libraries
location with the options --with-gmp-include=<path> and --with-gmp-lib=<path>
respectively when running configure.
```
Note that specifying `--with-gmp-include=/usr/local/include --with-gmp-lib=/usr/local/lib ` without setting `CC` as above fails just the same.

The reason is as I said: /usr/local/include is not in the default cc's path:

```
$ cat t.c
#include <gmp.h>
$ cc -c t.c                      # fails
t.c:1:10: fatal error: 'gmp.h' file not found
#include <gmp.h>
         ^~~~~~~
1 error generated.
$ cc -I/usr/local/include -c t.c # OK
```
