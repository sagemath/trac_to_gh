As mentioned here: #25091#comment:69

We place the `PythonModule` feature for pynormaliz, already used in `sage.geometry.polyhedron`, in `sage.features.normaliz`.

This is preparation for #32174/#30746.

You can just write

See #30647 for a new idiom - `lazy_import` with feature - that could replace code like this:

```
        PythonModule("PyNormaliz", spkg="pynormaliz").require()
        import PyNormaliz

I do understand what is the goal of this ticket.

Do we want to make `pynormaliz` a standard package?

Or is this this new lazy import idiom better for python package that can also be installed via other sources (e.g. a pip install)?
