As mentioned here: #25091#comment:69

We place the `PythonModule` feature for pynormaliz, already used in `sage.geometry.polyhedron`, in `sage.features.normaliz`.

This is preparation for #32174/#30746.

<a id='comment:6'></a>I do understand what is the goal of this ticket.

Do we want to make `pynormaliz` a standard package?

Or is this this new lazy import idiom better for python package that can also be installed via other sources (e.g. a pip install)?
