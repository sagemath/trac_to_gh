I have found the following bug in limit:

```
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.6, Release Date: 2019-01-15'
sage: f=exp(-2*x^2)-cos(2*x);f
-cos(2*x) + e^(-2*x^2)
sage: g=x*(sin(x))^3;g
x*sin(x)^3
sage: lim(f/g,x=0) # this is wrong
und
sage: lim(f/g,x=0,dir='-'),lim(f/g,x=0,dir='+') # the second result is wrong
(4/3, +Infinity)
sage: taylor(f/g,x,0,3) # this is right
-26/45*x^2 + 4/3
sage: lim(f/x^4,x=0) # this is right too
4/3
```

(I am on OS X El Capitan (10.11.6).)

This seems to be a very old bug:  The results are the same for

```
sage: version()
'SageMath Version 6.10, Release Date: 2015-12-18'
```

This problem occurs only with maxima. With fricas it works as expected. But these are some of the other cases where the result is ambiguous.

```
