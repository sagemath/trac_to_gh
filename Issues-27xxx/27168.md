It gets ugly with library conflicts, so more libraries available on the system should be used instead of ones shipped by Sage, e.g. `freetype` is a good example. Freetype may be used by R packages, and they in turn might depend on other system libraries we don't even know about, cf. e.g. #27163.

Ticket closed as duplicate after the corresponding changes were integrated in #27825.

Perhaps of interest, from cairo's own `configure.ac`: https://cgit.freedesktop.org/cairo/tree/configure.ac#n489

We can probably reuse much of this.

I actually do not know how to deal with freetype's deps: bzip2, libpng (and zlib - not explicitly listed, but a dep of libpng).

Naturally, if we have to build any of these, we cannot use a system's freetype.

Which brings up the need for a proper dependencies resolver, and raises the question whether we are doing all this right. 

IMHO a better plan would be to spin off some, and then all,
non-python deps of Sage into a separate (auto-tools) project/package, which builds and installs them into SAGE_LOCAL (just the autotools `--prefix` parameter).
This would allow this to be gradual, once the initial setup, with just a handful already `spkg-configure.m4`-ed packages spun off.
The advantage is that the dependency resolution would be a natural top-down thing.

However, I should also add some logic to SAGE_SPKG_COLLECT (likely with an external helper script) to actually load the package dependency graph and do these checks in a reasonable such that we don't even try to use a package from the system unless we've already detected all its dependencies from the system.

Well, perhaps bundling is a wrong word, but the idea is that once you removed a lot of stuff from Sage, you need means to build few missing pieces in a coherent way.
The complexity of doing this inside Sage is too much, in particular due to inflexible and a bit broken dependency resolution we have.

I don't see why this always be the case. E.g. our current libgd is pretty old, and 
it does not need dependencies as new as provided by Sage (e.g. bz2). So the host system might have its own libgd, matching our version requirements, and spkg-configure.m4 would tell Sage to stay with the system's libgd. Yet, a newer libgd dependency, bz2, required by Sage for some reason, gets built by Sage. Oops, now we have system's libgd that might get mis-linked to Sage's bz2, or, worse, stuff gets broken during loading at runtime
(or, even worse, gets subtly broken and result in wrong results).
This is really playing with fire.

Often (freetype is a good example) Sage dependencies get updated just because something breaks on version N of BlaFoo OS, without much regard to whether this might break
Sage on version N-1 of BlaFoo OS (often, but by no means always, it is meant to continue working...).

I agree with this ofc.  If for some reason Sage (or really some other dependency of Sage) specifically needs some recent-enough libbz2 (for example) then we really need to check for that version on the system (either by actual version number, though better by feature checks if possible).  If not found, then we have to build our own copy.  And my point is that in that case we then need to also, at least by default, build all other dependencies that depend on that libbz2, regardless whether they can otherwise be found on the system.

I'll make a specific ticket for adding an spkg-configure.m4 for bzip2 and add it as a dependency of this ticket.

I'm testing this out right now.  My general feeling about version checks is to avoid it until and unless we know a specific reason we need it.

Here the reason would be to avoid nasty surprises for people installing Sage in weird places. 

Actually, while I was at it

```
$ bzip2 --version 2>&1 | sed -n -e 's/bzip2.* Version *\([[0-9]]*\.[[0-9]]*\.[[0-9]]*\).*/\1/p'

outputs 1.0.6, as needed. (then one can steal the rest of version-checking from spkg-configure.m4 of patch spkg, say, to check the version).

Somebody starts installing Sage on an HPC cluster with typical semi-obsolete 10 years-old Linux version, and it fails as it picks up system's bzlib2 from previous century...

I don't like this:

```

+      AC_SUBST(SAGE_FREETYPE_PREFIX, ['$SAGE_LOCAL'])
+    else
+      AC_SUBST(SAGE_FREETYPE_PREFIX, [yes])
+    fi
```

I think if we need this variable at all (which it seems we do currently for building libgd) it should either be an actual filesystem path or empty for consistency's sake.  If some random package (like again, libgd) requires you to pass `--with-freetype=yes` that should be handled in its spkg-install, e.g. like

```
if [ -n "$SAGE_FREETYPE_PREFIX" ]; then
    CONFIGURE_LIBGD="$CONFIGURE_LIBGD --with-freetype=$SAGE_FREETYPE_PREFIX"
else
    CONFIGURE_LIBGD="$CONFIGURE_LIBGD --with-freetype=yes"
fi
```

or something along those lines.

ideally, we should be adding an extra parameter to `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE` to list dependencies that must be verified to come from the system, instead of this monotonous
copypastes for these checks.

(It could even be the 2nd parameter, and we then mass-edit all the spkg-configure.m4 to make use of it)

It doesn't necessarily have to be an argument to `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, although that could be nice.  It could also be a macro similar to `AC_REQUIRE` that you would put at the top.  I agree it should be made less repetitive either way.
