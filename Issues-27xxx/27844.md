This is a bug:

```
sage: F = GF(2)
sage: E = GF(4)
sage: phi = E.coerce_map_from(F); phi
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field of size 2
  To:   Finite Field in z2 of size 2^2
  Defn: 1 |--> 1
sage: phi.section()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
