<a id='comment:4'></a>Why did it change from `V` to `W` here?

```diff
-                z = V.random_element()
-                alpha = from_V(z)
+                alpha = from_V(W.random_element())
```
So I can say every other change is good except for the behavior change noted in the ticket description, which is this change:

```diff
-            # We move each element of W to this subfield.
-            c = alpha.coordinates_in_terms_of_powers()
+            # We move each generator of W to this subfield.
+            K, _ = K.subfield(alpha, 'beta')
+            gens = [K(x) for x in gens]
+            V, from_V, to_V = K.vector_space()
+            mod_gens = [to_V(x) for x in gens]
+            ambient = ZZ**V.dimension()
+            W = ambient.span(mod_gens)
```
For this, I would like someone who knows the theory to look at this change.

This part of the code was just unused and plain wrong.

Do you know who we should put in cc ?

`@`chapoton This is a little too far outside my area to say confidently enough that it was wrong and this is the fix. However, if it is unused, then maybe this discussion is moot since that code will never be called.
