On Python 3.7, this doctest times out:

```
sage: from sage.parallel.map_reduce import RESetMPExample, RESetMapReduceWorker
sage: from threading import Thread
sage: EX = RESetMPExample(maxl=6)
sage: EX.setup_workers(2)

sage: w0, w1 = EX._workers
sage: w0._todo.append(42)
sage: thief0 = Thread(target=w0._thief, name="Thief")
sage: thief0.start()

sage: w1.steal()
42
sage: w0._todo
deque([])
```
