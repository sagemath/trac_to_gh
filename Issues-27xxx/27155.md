```
1. the usage of `PyErr_Fetch` in `error_handler()` is a memory leak: the returned objects should be deallocated (Cython does not take care of this since the type is `PyObject*` as opposed to `object`).

2. in various places in the libGAP interface, there is code of the form

```
        try:
            ...
        except RuntimeError as msg:
            raise ValueError('libGAP: '+str(msg))
```
It's not clear to me why we need to catch and re-raise an exception here. Instead, we are raising this exception in our `error_handler`, so we can just use a custom exception class `GAPError` to make it clear that the error comes from GAP.

3. while I'm at it, I'm also replacing `libGAP` -> `GAP` in various places and removing the obsolete `src/sage/libs/gap/test` test program.

Depends on #26992
