            sage: I = R.ideal([a^2-a, b^2-b, a+b])

            sage: GB2 = I.groebner_basis()
            sage: GB1 is GB2
```
returns `False`, the Gröbner basis is recomputed. This is problematic, as a lot of methods (e.g. `.variety`) simply call `.groebner_basis()` and a precomputed Gröbner basis (maybe with a different algorithm than the default) is not used.

The generic way around that is to instead have the default call `self.groebner_basis(algorithm=<algorithmname>)` with the chosen algorithm. The other thing you could do, and which might be better, is to explicitly set the cache in those cases.

This is not what we want: We do want that `algorithm=''` tries a couple of things until it succeeds (or fails after all).

> The other thing you could do, and which might be better, is to explicitly set the cache in those cases.


You mean setting the cache for `algorithm=''` to be the same as for `algorithm='chosen'`. This could work ;)
