```
returns `False`, the Gröbner basis is recomputed. This is problematic, as a lot of methods (e.g. `.variety`) simply call `.groebner_basis()` and a precomputed Gröbner basis (maybe with a different algorithm than the default) is not used.

This is not what we want: We do want that `algorithm=''` tries a couple of things until it succeeds (or fails after all).

You mean setting the cache for `algorithm=''` to be the same as for `algorithm='chosen'`. This could work ;)
