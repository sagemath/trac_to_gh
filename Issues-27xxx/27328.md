This is not what we want: We do want that `algorithm=''` tries a couple of things until it succeeds (or fails after all).

> The other thing you could do, and which might be better, is to explicitly set the cache in those cases.


You mean setting the cache for `algorithm=''` to be the same as for `algorithm='chosen'`. This could work ;)

Moreover, I've simplifed the way arguments are processed and handled, and cleaned up of what seems to be historically grown (and sometimes not even used or incompatible or even ignored).
