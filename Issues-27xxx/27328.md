returns `False`, the Gröbner basis is recomputed. This is problematic, as a lot of methods (e.g. `.variety`) simply call `.groebner_basis()` and a precomputed Gröbner basis (maybe with a different algorithm than the default) is not used.

The generic way around that is to instead have the default call `self.groebner_basis(algorithm=<algorithmname>)` with the chosen algorithm. The other thing you could do, and which might be better, is to explicitly set the cache in those cases.

This is not what we want: We do want that `algorithm=''` tries a couple of things until it succeeds (or fails after all).

> The other thing you could do, and which might be better, is to explicitly set the cache in those cases.


You mean setting the cache for `algorithm=''` to be the same as for `algorithm='chosen'`. This could work ;)

Replying to [nbruin](#comment%3A4):
> The building of the cache is still reliant on `cached_method`. For instance, that means that if `I.groebner_basis()` is called and then `I.groebner_basis(algorithm=<whatever the default is>)`, then the algorithm gets executed twice.


This is now fixed as well.

Moreover, I've simplifed the way arguments are processed and handled, and cleaned up of what seems to be historically grown (and sometimes not even used or incompatible or even ignored).

Please review :)
