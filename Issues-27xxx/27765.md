For a number field K whose defining polynomial has a non-integral rational coefficient, factoring a polynomial with coefficients in K sometimes results in the following `UserWarning`:

```
SageMath version 8.8.beta1, Release Date: 2019-04-07
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 1/2)
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: p = 11*a*y + 7
sage: p.factor()
/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py:1682: UserWarning: interpreting PARI polynomial 11 relative to the defining polynomial x^2 - 2 of the PARI number field
  % (x, self.pari_polynomial()))
(11*a) * (y + 14/11*a)
```

I am so sorry for re-opening this. But I was just playing around some more with pari and discovered the following:

```
>>> (pari('y^4')+pari('x^2')-pari('x^2')).poldegree()
0
>>> (pari('y^4')+pari('x^2')-pari('x^2'))[0]

I am not sure how much of a corner case this is and that there is actually additional work necessary. But I definitively want to think this over before giving it a positive review.

Replying to [mgoerner](#comment%3A5):
> I am so sorry for re-opening this. But I was just playing around some more with pari and discovered the following:


Hmm, Pari's handling of multivariable polynomials is pretty idiosyncratic:

```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + y^4')
sage: q = pari('x^2')
sage: p.variables(), q.variables()
([x, y], [x])
sage: a = p - p + 1
sage: a, a.poldegree(), a.variables()
(1, 0, [x])
sage: b = q - q
sage: b, b.poldegree(), b.variables()
(0, -9223372036854775807, [x])
sage: c = p - q
sage: c, c.poldegree(), c.variables()
(y^4, 0, [x, y])
sage: pari('z - z').variables()
[z]
sage: pari('z + x - z - x').variables()
[x]
```
I think the following is a better test for being constant:

```
sage: def degrees(poly): return [poly.poldegree(v) for v in poly.variables()]
sage: degrees(a)
[0]
sage: degrees(b)
[-9223372036854775807]
sage: degrees(c)
[0, 4]
sage: def is_const(poly): 
          return all(poly.poldegree(v) <= 0 for v in poly.variables())
sage: [is_const(x) for x in [a, b, c, p, q]]
[True, True, False, False, False]
```
I will update my branch along these lines.
