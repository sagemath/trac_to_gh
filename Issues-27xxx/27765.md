For a number field K whose defining polynomial has a non-integral rational coefficient, factoring a polynomial with coefficients in K sometimes results in the following `UserWarning`:

```
SageMath version 8.8.beta1, Release Date: 2019-04-07
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(x^2 - 1/2)
sage: R.<y> = PolynomialRing(K)
sage: p = 11*a*y + 7
sage: p.factor()
/sage/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sage/rings/number_field/number_field.py:1682: UserWarning: interpreting PARI polynomial 11 relative to the defining polynomial x^2 - 2 of the PARI number field
  % (x, self.pari_polynomial()))
(11*a) * (y + 14/11*a)
```
This is related to #22202 and see [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-4B4322qI9M](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-4B4322qI9M) for further discussion.

Hmm, Pari's handling of multivariable polynomials is pretty idiosyncratic:

```
sage: p = pari('x^2 + y^4')
sage: q = pari('x^2')
sage: p.variables(), q.variables()
([x, y], [x])
sage: a = p - p + 1
sage: a, a.poldegree(), a.variables()
(1, 0, [x])
sage: b = q - q
sage: b, b.poldegree(), b.variables()
(0, -9223372036854775807, [x])
sage: c = p - q
sage: c, c.poldegree(), c.variables()
(y^4, 0, [x, y])
sage: pari('z - z').variables()
[z]
sage: pari('z + x - z - x').variables()
[x]
```
I think the following is a better test for being constant:

```
sage: def degrees(poly): return [poly.poldegree(v) for v in poly.variables()]
sage: degrees(a)
