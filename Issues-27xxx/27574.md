I don't really like marking tests as random when there is exact output. I think the better thing to do is to change the test to check that the output matches something explicit.

page 201 of the book (http://sagebook.gforge.inria.fr/english.html)

```
Let us continue. For the following system, J.variety() computes (exactly) a
triangular decomposition of J, then finds numerically the real solutions of the
obtained system(s). This yields a unique real solution:

sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]; J = ideal([ x^7-(100*x-1)^2, y-x^7+1 ])
sage: J.variety(RealField(51))
[{y: 396340.890166545, x: -14.1660266425312}]

Yet, by performing the computation exactly until the end, we see there are three
real solutions, and the value of x in the above numerical solution is completely
wrong:
