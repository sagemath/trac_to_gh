The top-level `configure` writes `src/bin/sage-env-config`. However, the file `local/bin/sage-env-config` is what is actually used by the build system. At some point during the build, `src/bin/sage-env-config` is copied to `local/bin/sage-env-config` but this does not happen immediately. This leads to race conditions where packages may be built with the wrong `sage-env-config`.

A very simple solution is to prefer `src/bin/sage-env-config` in case that both are present.

Before #26787, these packages were compiled with `-std=c++11`. So the obvious fix is simply to put back those flags which were removed in #26787.

Could you post the `sage-env-config` from one of these broken systems here?

The glob `build/pkgs/*/*` in the `build/make/Makefile` target should indeed trigger it. At least that's what we expect. But you should have logs showing whether it happened or not.

Replying to [embray](#comment%3A26):
> It should only use the one in `$SAGE_ROOT/src/bin` when it's present.


I think there is a misunderstanding.

The problem is when *both* `local/bin/sage-env-config` and `src/bin/sage-env-config` are present. It used to prefer `local/bin/sage-env-config` which is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. Instead, it should prefer `src/bin/sage-env-config` which is directly generated by `configure`.

I went for the most simple solution here. There are probably better solutions, for example having only one such file. But those require bigger changes and I didn't want to do that for a blocker ticket.

Amusingly, I just got bitten by this myself, but only because I copied an existing source tree to a new location.

This whole thing is totally insane - does it support `./configure --prefix=` ?

Shouldn't it be possible to have a number of build trees, with potentially different `sage-env-config` ? Shouldn't `src/bin/sage-env-config` actually not be there at all?!
Why do we keep mixing up build trees with source...

But then how is `$SAGE_LOCAL` determined? If you use `--prefix`, there needs to be at least one place where the location of `$SAGE_LOCAL` is stored and that place is `src/bin/sage-env-config`.

I'm setting this back to needs_review since I don't really understand your complaint.

OK, fine, but why does this even get copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`?

Its place is not there, not in somewhere that is in the `$PATH`.
but rather in something like `$SAGE_LOCAL/config/` or so...

I hope this explains.

But then you have a circular problem:

1. you need to know `$SAGE_LOCAL` in order to find the file `$SAGE_LOCAL/config/sage-env-config`

2. you need to read `$SAGE_LOCAL/config/sage-env-config` to know `$SAGE_LOCAL`

Having a file that is loaded from one place when running out of the source, but a different place when "installed" is normal, and there are many cases like that in Sage.  This makes perfect sense to me as-is.

When running `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` for example, it uses `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env`, which in turn should source `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config` (which just sets a few variables that are determined by `./configure` and are placed in a separate file from the main `sage-env` mostly for clarity's sake...)

You just said that this is available from `src/bin/sage-env-config`, no?


>

No, this is in `src/bin/sage-env-config`, that's how you can find it.

Well, maybe there is my aversion to changing the environment without running `./configure` that speaks here, but this is really the same issue as in #27373.

Do you say that `sage -i` doesn't work if `./configure --prefix=X` was run with `X != $SAGE_LOCAL`?
