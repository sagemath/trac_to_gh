```
This does a few things:

* Updates the gcc SPKG to support DESTDIR installation so that it can now be uninstalled as well

* This includes a patch (adapted from Debian) to make gcc install libraries to `${prefix}/lib` instead of `${prefix}/lib64` on Linux (this does not appear to be a problem on Cygwin, macOS, or FreeBSD that I'm aware of).

* Additional refactoring to reduce duplication between the gcc and gfortran SPKGs: This includes the patches from gcc as the can also be relevant to gfortran.

I've tested this a good bit on Linux (being able to uninstall gcc now is nice), but it needs more testing on other platforms, particularly macOS since it's the primary case for installing this package in the first place, and involves additional workarounds.

This would also fix #26996 for the case of installing gfortran on Linux.

Actually that's a large part of why I pinged you.  Although this was motivated by fixing an issue on Linux, OSX is the primary reason we package gcc and gfortran at all.  And since this reworks those packages a bit it needs OSX testing.  Plus, whatever disagreements we've had in the past, your reviews are always thorough and thoughtful.  If you don't have time though no problem--I have SSH access to an OSX machine now too (10.14 I believe).

Hahah ^^; should that work at all in the first place?  When you say "using FC=flang" do you mean just `export FC=flang` to the environment?

To be clear, I don't think this changes anything in what happens when you run `./configure`.  It does mainly two things:

* Refactors the `spkg-build`/`spkg-install` for the gfortran package so that it does not duplicate much effort from the gcc SPKG.

* Adds the Debian-inspired patch for gcc so that it doesn't install libraries to `${prefix}/lib64` on Linux
