```
sage: n = 3; C = crystals.Spins(["B", n])
sage: r = 10; T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*r))
sage: %time len(T.highest_weight_vectors())
CPU times: user 18.3 s, sys: 196 ms, total: 18.5 s
Wall time: 18.5 s

sage: %time len(list(T.highest_weight_vectors_iterator()))
CPU times: user 5.69 s, sys: 76 ms, total: 5.76 s
Wall time: 5.76 s

```
Now most of the time is spent in computing phi.

Moreover, you must compute `phi(i)` and `epsilon(i)` for every element and `i \\in I`. Thus you should keep track of the running `phi` and apply the 2-fold tensor product formulas to change that by using the `epsilon`/`phi` of each element. Also, I think you should add another function\n\n```python\n# in the general tensor category\ndef _check_i_highest_weight(self, i, epsilon):\n    return self.e(i) is None\n\n# in the tensor product of regular crystals category\ndef _check_i_highest_weight(self, i, epsilon):\n    return epsilon == 0\n```\nto avoid some extra `e(i)` computations in a large number of cases. This might be a minor slowdown in the general category, but I think it will be negligible.\n\nPlease give more descriptive variable names, e.g., `it_pos` makes it seem like it is the position of the iterator, not the data at `pos` in `it`. It might be better to unroll the `it` and use individual variables to avoid a bunch of list lookups (IIRC, it is faster to do this). Also maybe put a comment about your check (or if you go with the code change I suggested above).\n\nI am not sure about manually keeping track of the positions compared to keeping iterators (and catching the `StopIteration`) for speed. Did you try both? Maybe it will be better with more descriptive variable names.\n\nI am still not convinced that we should have an iterator method for this. I have never been too big of a fan of having two methods, where the first just runs a list of the second. Nevertheless, the `highest_weight_vectors` should use this implementation.",

I probably fall on the side of making the list since in principle, but the old code worked for infinite crystals (but would run forever). If anything, we probably want to run `C.list()` instead of `list(C)` as the former is cached.

I was going to say above that we should keep using `is_highest_weight`, but there is a fairly strong connection with the element class for the `TensorProductOfCrystals`. Moreover, you must compute `phi(i)` and `epsilon(i)` for every element and `i \in I`. Thus you should keep track of the running `phi` and apply the 2-fold tensor product formulas to change that by using the `epsilon`/`phi` of each element. Also, I think you should add another function

```python
# in the general tensor category
def _check_i_highest_weight(self, i, epsilon):
    return self.e(i) is None

# in the tensor product of regular crystals category
def _check_i_highest_weight(self, i, epsilon):
    return epsilon == 0
```
to avoid some extra `e(i)` computations in a large number of cases. This might be a minor slowdown in the general category, but I think it will be negligible.

Please give more descriptive variable names, e.g., `it_pos` makes it seem like it is the position of the iterator, not the data at `pos` in `it`. It might be better to unroll the `it` and use individual variables to avoid a bunch of list lookups (IIRC, it is faster to do this). Also maybe put a comment about your check (or if you go with the code change I suggested above).

I am not sure about manually keeping track of the positions compared to keeping iterators (and catching the `StopIteration`) for speed. Did you try both? Maybe it will be better with more descriptive variable names.

I am still not convinced that we should have an iterator method for this. I have never been too big of a fan of having two methods, where the first just runs a list of the second. Nevertheless, the `highest_weight_vectors` should use this implementation.

This improvement is not all that interesting without having it as an iterator, because I do not have enough memory to store all the highest weight vectors in a list for the cases I am interested in: arbitrary finite crystal, large tensor power.

It's mainly important for me to have this as a trac ticket, so I can share it easily with the people I am working with.

Thus, if you insist on not having an iterator, I'd rather not invest much more time for now - except for your confirmation that the index set is always the same (I wasn't absolutely sure if that's always true, thanks!) and except that I indeed would like to keep track of phi, but I am not skilled enough to do that efficiently and to be sure that what I am doing is correct.

I admit that I do not understand your code snippet.  Please elaborate - I am by no means a crystal expert!

Concerning the decisions I took: I tried about 10 different versions.  I think the biggest speedup comes from not using `is_highest_weight`, because that saves a lot of unneccessary computation.  The second largest chunk of time was to get rid of the iterators.

The amount of time spent for the setup code at the beginning is absolutely negligible.

I tried to unroll `it`, in several different ways.  The current version turned out to be the fastest.  I guess this will be even better by removing the index set, thanks again.

One further question, since you mentioned infinite crystals.  Consider

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux("A1")
sage: T = B.tensor(B)
```
Now, after the natural naive adaptation of the code, I can do

```
sage: it = T.highest_weight_vectors_iterator()
sage: next(it)
[[[1]], [[1]]]
```
However, apparently in this tensor product, the highest weight words are

```
[[[1]], [[1, 2]]]
[[[1]], [[1, 2, 2]]]
[[[1]], [[1, 2, 2, 2]]]
```
rather than

```
[[[1, 2]], [[1]]]
[[[1, 2, 2]], [[1]]]
[[[1, 2, 2, 2]], [[1]]]
```
Is this a bug?

Bug or not, it implies that the iterator would not return, because it modifies left most positions first.

The following would be still quite a bit faster, but comes at the cost of some readability.

Of course, if computing `epsilon` is expensive, this will make a lot of difference.

For example, I get

```
sage: n = 6; C = crystals.Spins(["B", n])
sage: r = 7; T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*r))
sage: %timeit for _ in T.highest_weight_vectors_iterator(): pass
1 loop, best of 3: 2.87 s per loop
```
vs. 4 seconds with the current branch.

```diff

In principle, this seems to work.

Replying to [tscrim](#comment%3A23):
> In regards to[comment:13](#comment%3A13). The `B(\infty)` crystal is very different than the highest weight crystals: it is only upper-regular, so `b.phi(i)` can be negative. Subsequently the tensor products are very different and quite wild (they have multiple highest weight vectors in a single component). This is a reflection in that category O is not closed under tensor products (e.g., the tensor product of 2 Verma modules is not in category O).


The documentation of `HighestWeightCrystals` says:

    A crystal is highest weight if it is acyclic; in particular, every
    connected component has a unique highest weight element, and that
    element generates the component.

Isn't then

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux("A3")
sage: T = B.tensor(B)
sage: T in HighestWeightCrystals
True
```
in contradiction to what you wrote?

Please excuse me, I had no idea that I sound accusatory!  I am just not familiar with these more exotic crystals - most of my knowledge is from the documentation of sage - so I was really just asking a question.

In any case, the category `HighestWeightCrystals` is closed under tensor products, right?

I'll have to look up what the category `O` is, I'll do this right now.

Thank you Travis! Since I cannot work on this in detail now, and the speedup with this patch is significant, would there be some quick fix?

I don't quite understand the problem with one of the crystals being infinite, because in this case the current algorithm fails too, doesn't it?

Yes, it is more of a question of what to do in terms of implementation. However, I think I should be able to do it today.

Yes, but for a different reason (it does not terminate because it wants to find all highest weight elements). It just needs a check or a restriction to finite crystals. I will think about the best way to do this.

Using a modified version from your[comment:38](#comment%3A38), I now get

```
sage: n = 3; C = crystals.Spins(["B", n])
sage: r = 10; T = crystals.TensorProduct(*([C]*r))
sage: %time len(T.highest_weight_vectors())
CPU times: user 2.11 s, sys: 31.5 ms, total: 2.14 s
Wall time: 2.14 s
731808
```
vs your branch:

```
CPU times: user 2.38 s, sys: 35.7 ms, total: 2.42 s
Wall time: 2.42 s
731808
```
If I cut out storing each of the crystal factors in memory, I get roughly a 2x slowdown. However, I figure most crystals will be "small" so this is okay.

I also now better handle the infinite crystal case.

So if my changes are okay, then positive review.
