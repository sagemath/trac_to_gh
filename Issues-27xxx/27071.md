```
Currently, we can get faces of polyhedron objects like this:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: TwoFace = P.faces(2)[0]
sage: TwoFace
<0,1,2,3>
```

It is sometimes useful to get a straight access to the printed indices given by the `_repr_`. Wishing something like:

```
sage: TwoFace.ambient_V_indices()
(0, 1, 2, 3)
```

And it would be nice to improve the `_repr_` of faces to have a more complete description:

```
sage: TwoFace
A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
```

... but for that one, better suggestions are welcome. The annoying thing with <0,1,2,3> is that it can be a square, and it can be a simplex, there is no way to know the dimension (which the face knows anyway) from the representation string.

To get the above, it was necessary to also implement `n_vertices`, `n_rays`, and `n_lines` for faces.

As a point of comparison to consider:

```
sage: P = polytopes.cube()
sage: LP = LatticePolytope(P.vertices_list())
sage: TwoFace = LP.faces(2)[0]
sage: TwoFace
2-d face of 3-d reflexive polytope in 3-d lattice M
sage: TwoFace.ambient_vertex_indices()
(1, 3, 5, 7)
```
This output is unified for lattice polytopes, cones, fans, and their components:

```
sage: F = NormalFan(LP)
sage: F
Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
sage: F.cones(2)[0]
2-d cone of Rational polyhedral fan in 3-d lattice N
```
Also

```
sage: type(TwoFace)
<class 'sage.geometry.lattice_polytope.LatticePolytopeClass'>
```
so faces are polytopes as well and all the methods of "standalone polytopes" are available for them as well.

Oh! Great, yes this is pretty much what I had in mind. I should probably use the same name of methods, to make this uniform too.

Further, to get the face as a polyhedron, the method `as_polyhedron` gives back the appropriate object:

```
sage: TwoFace.as_polyhedron()
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
sage: type(TwoFace.as_polyhedron())
<class 'sage.geometry.polyhedron.parent.Polyhedra_ZZ_ppl_with_category.element_class'>
```

I found it more convenient to have faces being "honest polytopes" - do you have any reasons for NOT doing it? (This is not the goal of this ticket, of course.)

A couple of questions: do we have any general guidelines for `n_vertices` vs. `nvertices`? I used the latter, but don't really have any preference. Except that it annoys me to have both versions for different objects since it is hard to remember when to use what.

More to the point - the ticket was about getting access to "ambient indices" via a method and perhaps making `_repr_` more complete. But now it seems that you have completely replaced the information that was in `_repr_` before. Do you want to keep those indices in `_repr_` at all? Do other people want it? Are they OK with a long-ish description now? In particular the old output of

```diff
             sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]]).face_lattice().level_sets()
-            [[<>], [<0>, <1>, <2>], [<0,1>, <0,2>, <1,2>], [<0,1,2>]]
+            [[A -1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3],
+             [A 0-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex,
+              A 0-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex,
+              A 0-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex],
+             [A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices,
+              A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices,
+              A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices],
+             [A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices]]
```
could be more desirable than the new one where different faces have the same repr.

To be clear - I am not saying that your changes are bad, they are after all very much in line with my choices for lattice polytopes, just want to make sure that all things and opinions are considered. Perhaps it is useful to combine verbose description with indices. And to keep it shorter I would vote for "2-d" instead of "2-dimensional". (Faces of lattice polytopes mention 3 different dimensions so space saving was particularly visible there.)

Good question. I followed the one for `Polyhedron` objects for which there are `n_equations`, `n_facets`, etc. I just checked for graphs and it uses `num_verts`, `num_edges`, etc.

In this case, I would stick to the local convention on `Polyhedron`.

Yes, you are right. While I was changing the doctests, I was thinking that the information becomes somewhat lost (indices of the vertices) on the one hand, but also somehow still good on the other (dimension, ambient dim, and number of vertices).

What is better? Hm.

For example, when dealing with larger polytopes, does printing a list with 50 vertex indices instructive? Or rather "A 4-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in `ZZ^5` defined as the convex hull of 50 vertices".

There is no way to know anything from just a list of indices... At least, that's how I react everytime I see such a list. But yes, sometimes, I am quite happy to see the list of indices, but then I can not fetch them in any practical way (hence this ticket!). So in the end, having them stuck in the `_repr_` was not the better way to go. The user can get exactly this output now through `ambient_V_indices`.

I agree, this is a big change and this should be discussed. I should perhaps ask on sage-devel.

One compromise is:

Change the doctests back so that they show the actual list of indices (via the new implemented method) and not just the `_repr_`. So at least the doctests are detecting potential reordering in the V-representation.

(Faces of lattice polytopes mention 3 different dimensions so space saving was particularly visible there.)

Sure, I appreciate your feedback!

Yes, I wanted to model it from your suggestion, while also keeping it uniform with the `_repr_` of Polyhedron object which give, for example:

```
sage: P
A 2-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^2 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices
```

Do faces have their own internal indices, i.e. are there edges randomly-but-consistently numbered 3 and 4? If yes, it could be useful to include this number in the output so one can see the difference between two edges in the output.

The indices are fixed, they are the indices in the V-representation.

I will change the doctests back to show the indices.

Concerning the naming convention, I would stick to `n_` as it is already the convention within `Polyhedron` objects. See the sage-devel discussion:

That's not what I meant, sorry for not being clear. My question was: is there edge !#3? Or a 5-dimensional face !#42? If that is the case, it may be useful to have this number in the repr. It does not have to be canonical in any sense, but when you have say a list of edges belonging to some higher-dimensional face, it may be nice to see that they are !#3, !#5, !#8, and !#23, rather than just that there are four edges, all looking exactly the same. And in any case that's just a suggestion, I don't insist ;-)

Oh, I see now! Okay! Hmm, the ordering is decided at the level of posets, through the face lattice. I do not know how much the ordering would be canonical. Especially now with the transition to python3, I would not try to introduce in there...

Only vertices receive a consistent numbering through the V-representation. The other faces do not...
