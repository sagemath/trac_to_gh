As Sage gets increasingly modular, it becomes important (also for the doc website, currently it has broken links to e.g. sagenb interacts in the reference manual) that these spun off docs are still easy to find.

In fact, sphinx has an extension to link different projects, 
see http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html

so this appears quite doable. 
Here is an incomplete docs to link

* sagetex
* sagenb  (see #25382)
* cypari
* cysignals
* pplpy (not yet in Sage, see #23024)

This is a question for packagers. I have no idea what they do with Sage's docs. I cc'd the packagers I can think of.

It can do both. When you declare a mapping let's say for numpy:

```
intersphinx_mapping = {'numpy': (URI, None)}
```

`URI` can be an online link or your numpy's documentation local directory.
