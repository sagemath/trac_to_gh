The module `sage.plot.plot3d.texture` defines a `Texture_class` class, and a `Texture` function that acts as its alternate constructor, along with an `is_Texture` function, Ã  la the old scheme used elsewhere in Sage.

As discussed elsewhere (e.g. in #12824) the `is_Texture` function should be deprecated.  The `Texture` function and `Texture_class` class can be merged into a single `Texture` class with use of a `__classcall__` method.

I do think the use of `__classcall__` is a bit overkill here, since it's basically just doing some argument pre-processing that could probably just as well be done in the `__init__`.  I thought maybe it would also cache some textures but apparently it doesn't even do that.

That said, this branch preserves the existing functionality, and I think in a better way than having a separate `Texture_class` and `Texture` factory function.
