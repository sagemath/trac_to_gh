Release v20170815 introduced a modular symbol scaling bug (while sorting out modular symbol scaling essentially correctly) in functions not currently used by Sage.  Other releases since the current one in Sage (v20180815) make some interface changes including precision handling (now using bits not digits), so some Sage code changes are likely to be necessary.

That is what I thought but it seems that the steps make distclean; make build took me back to python2 (where all is well with the patch uploaded).

I will build the branch from scratch again, this time making sure it is python3.

So now the situation is that this branch works fine under python2 but not under python3 where the output buffering issue arises.  To be clear: after switching to this commit and putting the new source tarball into upstream/ I do

```
make distclean
./configure --with-python=3
MAKE='make -j20' make
./sage -t src/sage/libs/eclib
```
and see doctest failures in 2 files all of which (by eye) are caused by output buffering.

The same happens on a different machine and a python3 build of vanilla 8.7.beta5 so this issue is *not* related to the eclib upgrade at all.  For that reason it might be better to open a new ticket for it, and not hold up this one.

Well if you ignore my "proof" remark it seems to be a fact that setting that environment variable fixes the issue.  Nothing has changed in eclib regarding buffering.

One fix would be to make changes in the Sage interface so that whenever an eclib function is called which outputs to stdout, the python stdout is flushed first.  It would be possible to add flushing functions in eclib itself but that does not seem the right approach to me.

I agree.  I didn't write the wrapping code -- I have only tweaked it so take changes to eclib into account.

Do you know how to convert an NTL RR into an element of RealField() or some other Sage real type?

<a id='comment:72'></a>OK, so testing all the elliptic_curves directory with a python3 build the only failures I get are ones which have nothing to do with this fix.

For the record there is one failure in each of ell_rational_field, ell_number_field, and padic_lseries.  The one in ell_rational_field has been fixed in #27432.

I think you're right in principle. On the other hand, sometimes it is more practical to just rebase a branch. For example, having one commit and then another one which reverts that is just adding noise to the git history. In that case, I'd rather just remove the commit.

<a id='comment:77'></a>I would like to publicly thank Jeroen for his work on this.  It's not the first time that eclib's inclusion in Sage has led to improvements in the library itself.

The less good news is that some of my code it not converging well with the new precision handling (decimal to bits) but not in a part which affects Sage, so there will not be another ticket to upgrade again.  Well, not this month.
