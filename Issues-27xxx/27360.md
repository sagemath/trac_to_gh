Release v20170815 introduced a modular symbol scaling bug (while sorting out modular symbol scaling essentially correctly) in functions not currently used by Sage.  Other releases since the current one in Sage (v20180815) make some interface changes including precision handling (now using bits not digits), so some Sage code changes are likely to be necessary.

That is what I thought but it seems that the steps make distclean; make build took me back to python2 (where all is well with the patch uploaded).

I will build the branch from scratch again, this time making sure it is python3.

So now the situation is that this branch works fine under python2 but not under python3 where the output buffering issue arises.  To be clear: after switching to this commit and putting the new source tarball into upstream/ I do

```
make distclean
./configure --with-python=3
MAKE='make -j20' make
./sage -t src/sage/libs/eclib
```
and see doctest failures in 2 files all of which (by eye) are caused by output buffering.

The same happens on a different machine and a python3 build of vanilla 8.7.beta5 so this issue is *not* related to the eclib upgrade at all.  For that reason it might be better to open a new ticket for it, and not hold up this one.

Well if you ignore my "proof" remark it seems to be a fact that setting that environment variable fixes the issue.  Nothing has changed in eclib regarding buffering.

One fix would be to make changes in the Sage interface so that whenever an eclib function is called which outputs to stdout, the python stdout is flushed first.  It would be possible to add flushing functions in eclib itself but that does not seem the right approach to me.

I applied this patch to debug:

```diff

```

What I see when I run the doctests on 64-bit:

```

```
So the precision is only 53 bits here. So one of the tests preceding it apparently changes the precision from 150 to 53.

I agree.  I didn't write the wrapping code -- I have only tweaked it so take changes to eclib into account.

Do you know how to convert an NTL RR into an element of RealField() or some other Sage real type?

The latest commit d63916a address some of the issues discovered.
1. By adding a couple of "cou<<flush;" statememts in the c++ wrapper file wrap.cpp I think I have dealt with that problem under python3.  At the same time I deleted some flushing which was there already but redundant.  The result works fine in python3.
2. Fixed an interface bug where I called eclib's set_precision() instead of set_bit_precision.  The former still takes a decimal precision input.
3. Fixed a doctesting bug where one test left the preciaion at a different value than the usual default.
4. Avoid converting an NTL:RR to a float via strings by using iNTL's to_double() as suggested, returning a double.

All that left a lot of computed number ending in some different digits.  I fixed those doctests in the stupid way, i.e. changing the expected digits to what I now get.  But I only tested on a 64-bit machine.  If there are problems on 32-bit I will probably get around that by replacing some trailing digits by "...".

Putting this back to "needs review", and the testing and debugging help already received are much appreciated.

Note that the docstring for these functions in `src/sage/libs/eclib/mwrank.pyx` and `src/sage/libs/eclib/interface.py` are different, so they should be merged.

Thanks -- but I also could do it.

The eclib wrapping happened in 2007 or 2006, by William --I made many changes to eclib at the time to make an interface even possible, but did not do the wrapping as at that time I had never written a single line of python.  After that William often suggested that it needed to be redone from scratch but the intersection of people who had the expertise to do that was always empty.

Of course.  For some reason I had created a new  branch tracking trac/u/jdemeyer/eclib.  Still, I think it may be bad practice to upload a branch with same name as an old one but which does not have the old one as parent...

I would like to publicly thank Jeroen for his work on this.  It's not the first time that eclib's inclusion in Sage has led to improvements in the library itself.

The less good news is that some of my code it not converging well with the new precision handling (decimal to bits) but not in a part which affects Sage, so there will not be another ticket to upgrade again.  Well, not this month.
