When using `latex(Tableau([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)))` we normally get back:

```
{\def\lr#1{\multicolumn{1}{|@{\hspace{.6ex}}c@{\hspace{.6ex}}|} 
{\raisebox{-.3ex}{$#1$}}}
 \raisebox{-.6ex}{$\begin{array}[b]{*{1}c}\cline{1-1}
 \lr{1}\\\cline{1-1}
 \end{array}$}
}
```

This is normally except when using sagetex. When sagetex runs, it encodes everything in

```
\newlabel{@sageinline0}{
    .... code goes here ...
}
```

This is normally ok except that in `\newlabel` we can't have `\def\lr#1` (in particular we need `##1` instead of `#1`). This means when using the code `\sage{Tableau([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))}` in latex causes problems and doesn't allow compilation.

This ticket proposes adding a new function called `sagetex()` which is like `latex()` in that objects can define a `_sagetex_` method and when `sagetex()` is called, the `_sagetex_` method is called, and if not present, it runs `latex()` instead.

After this implementation, we'd propose a change to sagetex (the latex package) in order to use the `sagetex()` function instead of the `latex()` function.

The reason we have decided this method is to try and allow more flexibility in the future. In particular, (as a use case other than adding proper definition embedding) if we ever want the code in `latex()` versus `sagetex()` to be vastly different, this would allow us to do that. Additionally, we chose not to do a grep replace of `#x` to `##x` (for x increasing) is due to the fact that there is a use case in which the user might actually want to keep `#1` and not have it escaped.
