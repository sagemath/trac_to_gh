It seems Arch is packaging it nevertheless, and it gets automatically loaded in this case.

That is correct.  This is fixed by #26930, so I would propose closing this as a duplicate, do you agree?

The fact is that without this fix, if some GAP packages are being loaded by default that in turn cause a shared module to be loaded it will fail.

Currently they don't, because until recently there *was* no libgap.  And for the case of using GAP directly it isn't necessary because the `gap` executable does not dynamically link with libgap either--it is all statically linked, so loading compiled packages from the `gap` executable works, whereas loading them from libgap does not, necessarily, if libgap itself was loaded with lazy symbol resolution as is the case when loading it as a result of importing a Python module :/",

This line in gap.py corresponds to the error code 13: GAP is trying to send a Window command, which points to the xgap package. 
I added some debug to figure out why the xgap package was being loaded and, to my surprise, I found out that Sage is trying to load *every* single GAP package installed on the system. Is that really intentional?

I've worked around this downstream by removing xgap from SuggestedPackages in sonata and cryst for now, but this should be fixed in sage itself so that it doesn't try to load xgap under any circumstances.
