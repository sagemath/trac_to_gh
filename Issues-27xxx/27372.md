Potential cause: dynamic modules are not yet well supported in libgap, right?
It seems Arch is packaging it nevertheless, and it gets automatically loaded in this case.

That is correct.  This is fixed by #26930, so I would propose closing this as a duplicate, do you agree?

The fact is that without this fix, if some GAP packages are being loaded by default that in turn cause a shared module to be loaded it will fail.

Linking all binary packages to libgap fixes this particular issue. However, this uncovers another problem: now I'm getting

```
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/interfaces/gap.py:648: UserWarning: this should never happen
  warnings.warn("this should never happen")
```

This line in gap.py corresponds to the error code 13: GAP is trying to send a Window command, which points to the xgap package. 
I added some debug to figure out why the xgap package was being loaded and, to my surprise, I found out that Sage is trying to load *every* single GAP package installed on the system. Is that really intentional?

Answering to myself: yes, this seems to be intentional

So xgap should definitely be blacklisted here.

I'm not sure if that *can* be fixed in Sage without some mechanism from upstream to make it easier to completely prevent a package from being loaded.

Also, the problem with xgap only impacts the pexpect interface to GAP.  There are some tickets elsewhere about reducing, and ultimately eliminating dependence on that in the core Sage library.
