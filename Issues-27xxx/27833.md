Inserting line breaks more cleverly in multiline outputs
could make them a lot more readable.

Here is an illustration (various more could be given).

Current:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(3^6)
sage: K.subfields()
[(Finite Field of size 3, Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field of size 3
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: 1 |--> 1), (Finite Field in a2 of size 3^2, Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a2 of size 3^2
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a2 |--> 2*a^5 + 2*a^3 + a^2 + 2*a + 2), (Finite Field in a3 of size 3^3,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a3 of size 3^3
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a3 |--> 2*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 2), (Finite Field in a6 of size 3^6,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a6 of size 3^6
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a6 |--> a)]
```

Proposed:

```
sage: K.<a> = GF(3^6)
sage: K.subfields()
[(Finite Field of size 3,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field of size 3
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: 1 |--> 1),
 (Finite Field in a2 of size 3^2,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a2 of size 3^2
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a2 |--> 2*a^5 + 2*a^3 + a^2 + 2*a + 2),
 (Finite Field in a3 of size 3^3,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a3 of size 3^3
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a3 |--> 2*a^5 + 2*a^4 + 2),
 (Finite Field in a6 of size 3^6,
  Ring morphism:
    From: Finite Field in a6 of size 3^6
    To:   Finite Field in a of size 3^6
    Defn: a6 |--> a)]
```

<a id='comment:1'>**Comment 1:**</a>
Maybe this amounts to: when some list or tuple elements display on multiple lines,
make sure there are line breaks between the elements.

<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
Does this have to do with the display hook?
