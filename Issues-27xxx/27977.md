Note that `from_A7_crystal` call `sorted` two times. 

If there is high performances expectations with these function, it might be best to juste tag the doctests with #py2 / #py3.

Ok thanks for your comments.

Your solution doesn't solve the case with `from_A7_crystal`, it looks likes one difference is that `gens` is not `None` when `CrystalMorphismByGenreators.__init__` is called. I am currently searching why this difference.

It's not clear to me why sorting at `CrystalMorphismByGenerators` level is cleaner than doing it at `KR_type_E7 level`. Can you expand on that please ?

My initial reasoning was that as it is a `KR_type_E7` specific problem the fix should not impact other classes.

Ah, right. I misread it as `gens is not None`. `^^;;` Actually, it really is just an output issue. This has zero impact on the code working (at least, it should otherwise I would suspect a bug).

It is not specific to that. It just happens to be that this case constructs the morphism using a (complicated enough) `dict` and this is not done elsewhere in any doctest. So this would cause an output difference in those doctests.

I am still not 100% happy with the change I proposed as it is essentially an unnecessary sort. However, I understand why you would do this for compatibility, and I doubt anyone is doing something with this where that would become a performance bottleneck. Well, this will now work (although we could force the sorting, but that would likely trivially break a bunch of other doctests):

```diff
         if gens is None:
             if isinstance(on_gens, dict):
-                gens = on_gens.keys()
+                gens = on_gens
             else:
                 gens = parent.domain().module_generators
+        if isinstance(gens, dict):
+            gens = sorted(gens)
         self._gens = tuple(gens)
```
I am definitely in favor of just changing the doctest to have `...` for the images of the generators for the morphism.
