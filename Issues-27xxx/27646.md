The problem is that the polynomial `nf` is not monic, but it should be.

Thanks!  

There were too many changes for me to review this quickly--looks like it was changes in spacing and formatting, so I'm not sure where the content was changed.  

I did confirm that the fix I suggested in line 778 is there, but I didn't test all of the changes.

Yes, sorry for this "formatting noise", I just could not resist fixing that.

The only serious change is

```
-        nf = nf.polresultant(nfF, parit)
+        nf = nf.polresultant(nfF, parit)  # either monic or -monic
+        if nf[n] == -1:
