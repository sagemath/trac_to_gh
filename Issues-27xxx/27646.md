The problem is that the polynomial `nf` is not monic, but it should be.

I think it's the same code by accident. The error looks unrelated.

Yes, sorry for this "formatting noise", I just could not resist fixing that.

The only serious change is

```
-        nf = nf.polresultant(nfF, parit)
+        nf = nf.polresultant(nfF, parit)  # either monic or -monic
+        if nf[n] == -1:
+            nf *= -1
```
