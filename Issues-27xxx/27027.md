There are several cases in `relabel()` which assume sorting of vertices. 

The following cases are fixed:

1. `perm=None`. This should just relabel with integers from 0 to N-1 in an arbitrary order (as the documentation already says).

2. `perm` is a callable. This is easy to avoid, as the ordering of the vertices is not used in the code:

```
        elif callable(perm):
            perm = dict( [ i, perm(i) ] for i in self.vertices() )
            complete_partial_function = False
```

This broke several functions which did assume a particular ordering for `G.relabel(perm=None)`. Those are fixed by using `G.relabel(perm=range(G.order()))` instead.

Furthermore, we allow arbitrary iterables to be given for relabeling instead of only `list` and `tuple`. This improves things with Python 3 where `range()` becomes an iterator.

You could use `G.relabel(list(range(G.order())))` instead of `G.relabel(list(range(len(G))))`.

In `generic_graph.py`, you changed the doctest `G.relabel(return_map=True) == expecting`. Isn't it risky to do that ? the ordering of the keys of a dictionary might differ in py2  and py3, no ?
