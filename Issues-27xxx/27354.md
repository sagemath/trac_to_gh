Evan O'Dorney reported that `assume(0 < x < 1)` doesn't work the way you'd expect it to:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-OdekKRf504

He's right, but this is probably unfixable. The chained comparison is translated by python into an "and" statement, and those aren't valid assumptions. Some other weird stuff takes place, too, and you wind up with junk. We should warn about this in the `assume()` documentation.

I don't think you can. I'll bet that it should have been `except AttributeError` all along, but nobody noticed because it wasn't tested.

    "body": "<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>\n1. I find this explanation not very clear:\n\n```\nDon't use python's chained comparison notation in assumptions.\nThe expression ``0 < x < 1``, is translated literally in python\nto ``(0 < x) and (x < 1)``, but the value of ``x < 1`` is always\nfalse when ``x`` is a symbolic variable. By an unlucky coincidence\nno error is raised, but needless to say, you don't wind up with\nthe assumptions that you wanted.\n```\n\nI would write something like\n\n```\nPython's chained comparison notation like ``assume(0 < x < 1)`` does not work.\nThis is because Python literally translates the expression ``0 < x < 1``\nto ``(0 < x) and (x < 1)``. Since the value of ``0 < x`` is typically\nfalse, the expression ``0 < x < 1`` evaluates to ``0 < x``.\n```\n\n2. Also this\n\n```\nSince both ``0 < x`` and\n``1 < x`` are false, the conjunction is false, and is thus itself\nequivalent to ``0 < x``. So, the simplification of ``0 < x < 1``\nto ``0 < x`` by python is admissible\n```\nis a bit strangely written. The fact that `0 < x < 1` equals `0 < x` is not an \"admissible simplification\", it's part of the Python language that `0 < x < 1` gets interpreted as `(0 < x) and (x < 1)` and that `X and Y` is `X` whenever `X` is false.\n\n3. Use 4 spaces for indentation, also in that `.. WARNING::` block.\n\n4. Why are we changing\n\n```\n        sage: var('n, P, r, r2')\n        (n, P, r, r2)\n```\nto\n\n```\nsage: n,P,r,r2 = SR.var('n, P, r, r2')\n```",

<a id='comment:9'>**Comment 9:**</a>
1. I find this explanation not very clear:

```
Don't use python's chained comparison notation in assumptions.
The expression ``0 < x < 1``, is translated literally in python
to ``(0 < x) and (x < 1)``, but the value of ``x < 1`` is always
false when ``x`` is a symbolic variable. By an unlucky coincidence
no error is raised, but needless to say, you don't wind up with
the assumptions that you wanted.
```

I would write something like

```
Python's chained comparison notation like ``assume(0 < x < 1)`` does not work.
This is because Python literally translates the expression ``0 < x < 1``
to ``(0 < x) and (x < 1)``. Since the value of ``0 < x`` is typically
false, the expression ``0 < x < 1`` evaluates to ``0 < x``.
```

2. Also this

```
Since both ``0 < x`` and
``1 < x`` are false, the conjunction is false, and is thus itself
equivalent to ``0 < x``. So, the simplification of ``0 < x < 1``
to ``0 < x`` by python is admissible
```
is a bit strangely written. The fact that `0 < x < 1` equals `0 < x` is not an "admissible simplification", it's part of the Python language that `0 < x < 1` gets interpreted as `(0 < x) and (x < 1)` and that `X and Y` is `X` whenever `X` is false.

3. Use 4 spaces for indentation, also in that `.. WARNING::` block.

4. Why are we changing

```
        sage: var('n, P, r, r2')
        (n, P, r, r2)
```
to

```
sage: n,P,r,r2 = SR.var('n, P, r, r2')
```

I was trying to weasel out of explaining exactly what's going on =P

The python docs are a bit ambiguous, since they say that `x and y` means "if x is false, then x, else y." In our case, `x` is **not** false -- it's a symbolic expression such that `bool(x)` is false. But I guess that still gets simplified to `x`, and that's why you get a junk result rather than an error.

In any case, I've tried to make the explanation in the WARNING block 
more precise, so that I don't need to waffle about it in the test case.


>

Fixed.


> 4. Why are we changing

Using `var()` to inject names into the global scope is a bad practice, so I think we should avoid it in EXAMPLES where possible. It didn't belong in that commit, though, so I've separated it out.

It's banned in the sage library because it causes non-local bugs. If I write

```
def foo():
    var('x')
    return baz(bar(x))
```

and then later call `foo`, it's going to clobber whatever `x` already exists. Unless you're familiar with the *implementation* of `foo`, you won't know what happened. Instead, I should be writing

```
def foo():
    x = SR.var('x')
    return baz(bar(x))
```

Now it's safe to call `foo` even when I have my own `x` in scope. One of these is always safe, and the other isn't. I don't know about consensus, but since `SR.var()` is strictly better, I think we should teach people the safe thing instead.
