Old one:

```
sage: A3.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), degrees=(1,2,2))
sage: B3 = A3.cdg_algebra(differential={y: a*x})

sage: %timeit B.cohomology_generators(40)
1 loop, best of 3: 553 ms per loop
```
New one:

```
sage: A3.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), degrees=(1,2,2))

<a id='comment:26'></a>A few other little things that I would like to see fixed before setting a positive review:

`max(self._minimalmodels.keys())` -> `max(self._minimalmodels)`
and `if max_degree in self._minimalmodels.keys():` -> `if max_degree in self._minimalmodels:`.

You still need to fix the docformatting for `minimal_model()` and `cohomology_algebra`.

Another docformatting thing, but less of an issue since it is hidden in `_im_gens_` (but I am picky about these things):

```diff
-        - ``codomain`` - The parent where the images live
+        - ``codomain`` -- the parent where the images live
 
-        - ``im_gens`` - A list or tuple with the images of the generators of this ring.
+        - ``im_gens`` -- a list or tuple with the images of the generators of this ring
```

`im_gens[i]**t[i] for i in range(len(t))` -> im_gens[i]**val for i,val in enumerate(t)`

Your `sum`'s also do not need to create the list, but this is a trivial comment.

```
        if len(cohomgens) == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cohomology ring has no generators")
```
Could this be `if not cohomgens:`? Also, the error message should start with a lowercase letter.

But when I run that code inside an interactive session, it works as expected.

I wonder if some of the errors come from the fact that i am developping on a python 3 environment. Seems plausible, since most are due to orderings of the answers in dictionaries.
