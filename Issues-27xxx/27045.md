I don't know how close this is to review, but this version of `cohomology_generators` is much slower than the old one.

Old one:

```
sage: A3.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), degrees=(1,2,2))
sage: B3 = A3.cdg_algebra(differential={y: a*x})
sage: %timeit B3.cohomology_generators(30)
1 loop, best of 3: 187 ms per loop
sage: A.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,2))
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra(differential={y: a*x})
sage: %timeit B.cohomology_generators(40)
1 loop, best of 3: 553 ms per loop
```
New one:

```
sage: A3.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(GF(3), degrees=(1,2,2))
sage: B3 = A3.cdg_algebra(differential={y: a*x})
sage: %timeit B3.cohomology_generators(30)
1 loop, best of 3: 2.3 s per loop
sage: A.<a,x,y> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ, degrees=(1,2,2))
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra(differential={y: a*x})
sage: %timeit B.cohomology_generators(40)
1 loop, best of 3: 6.32 s per loop
```

If the new version gives different answers from the old one, you should add some doctests to demonstrate this, and in particular the advantages of the new one.

Don't hurry this on my account; it is not always predictable when I will have time to review a ticket.

My point is that the previous method gave an answer that is "wrong", in the sense of giving a generating system that has redundant elements. If one wants just a generating system, one can use all the cohomology classes up to the given degree. So it only makes sense to provide a specific method to compute a reduced system if it is indeed minimal. Hence the change.

I will add a doctest with an example where the given answer is different from the previous method.

In particular, with the old method:


```
sage: A.<e1,e2,e3,e4> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: d = A.differential({e1:e4*e3,e2:e4*e3})
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra(d)
sage: B.cohomology_generators(10)
{1: [e4, e3, -e1 + e2], 2: [e2*e4, e2*e3, e1*e4, e1*e3]}
```

whereas with the new:

```
sage: A.<e1,e2,e3,e4> = GradedCommutativeAlgebra(QQ)
sage: d = A.differential({e1:e4*e3,e2:e4*e3})
sage: B = A.cdg_algebra(d)
sage: B.cohomology_generators(10)
{1: [e4, e3, -e1 + e2], 2: [e2*e4, e2*e3]}
```


Note that `e1*e4 = -e4*(-e1+e2) + e2*e4`

<a id='comment:26'></a>
A few other little things that I would like to see fixed before setting a positive review:

`max(self._minimalmodels.keys())` -> `max(self._minimalmodels)`
and `if max_degree in self._minimalmodels.keys():` -> `if max_degree in self._minimalmodels:`.

You still need to fix the docformatting for `minimal_model()` and `cohomology_algebra`.

Another docformatting thing, but less of an issue since it is hidden in `_im_gens_` (but I am picky about these things):

```diff
-        - ``codomain`` - The parent where the images live
+        - ``codomain`` -- the parent where the images live
 
-        - ``im_gens`` - A list or tuple with the images of the generators of this ring.
+        - ``im_gens`` -- a list or tuple with the images of the generators of this ring
```

`im_gens[i]**t[i] for i in range(len(t))` -> im_gens[i]**val for i,val in enumerate(t)`

Your `sum`'s also do not need to create the list, but this is a trivial comment.

```
        if len(cohomgens) == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cohomology ring has no generators")
```
Could this be `if not cohomgens:`? Also, the error message should start with a lowercase letter.

But when I run that code inside an interactive session, it works as expected.

I wonder if some of the errors come from the fact that i am developping on a python 3 environment. Seems plausible, since most are due to orderings of the answers in dictionaries.
