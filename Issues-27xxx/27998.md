As [reported in Ask SageMath question #46915](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46915/solve-equation-with-two-variables-over-rr/):

```
sage: x,y = var('x,y', domain=RR)
sage: solve(x == 0, x, y)
```

gives an error message (unlike variants without assumptions, solving for a single variable, or adding a dummy equation).

It can be traced as follows: in `sage/symbolic/relation.py` the function `solve` calls `_solve_expression` to handle the single expression case. This (by default) uses the Maxima interface to create an initial list of solutions `X`, which is then filtered according to `assumptions()`. This filtering assumes that each solution in `X` is a single equation (it calls `.lhs()` on elements of `X`), which is not true in the case of multiple variables.

Keywords: **solve, assumptions, domain**

Component: **symbolics**
