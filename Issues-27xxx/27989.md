```
_r_action_ and _l_action_ are in the docs, despite removed in #5597

quick grepping through src/sage/ shows that  _r_action_ is never defined/used (only mentioned in commented out code
or in messages), and  _l_action_ is defined exactly once, in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`
and only used there, once.

So none of this is understood by any coersion/etc frameworks.

A documentation bug, I suppose (and probably a bug in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`, which uses
wrongly named stuff...)
