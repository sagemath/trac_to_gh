```
`_r_action_` and `_l_action_` are in the docs, despite removed in #5597

quick grepping through src/sage/ shows that  `_r_action_` is never defined/used (only mentioned in commented out code
or in messages), and  `_l_action_` is defined exactly once, in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`
and only used there, once.

So none of this is understood by any coersion/etc frameworks.

A documentation bug, I suppose (and probably a bug in `src/sage/rings/multi_power_series_ring_element.py`, which uses
wrongly named stuff...)

the issue is not just to remove `_l_action_` and `_r_action_`, but to document how to implement coercion for action properly using `_act_on_` and `_acted_upon_`, instead of now non-existing `_l_action_` and `_r_action_`
