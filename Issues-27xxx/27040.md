1. `sage.all` should be importable and mostly usable even if no environment variables like `SAGE_ROOT` or `SAGE_LOCAL` are set. This requires a new function `join` which is like `os.path.join` except that `None` values are propagated.

2. Several unneeded variables are removed.

3. Get rid of the over-engineered `$VAR` replacement stuff.

4. In some places, `SAGE_LIB` (installed location of Sage) can be used instead of `SAGE_SRC`.

5. Determine `SAGE_LIB` not from `site-packages` but from `sage.__file__`

6. Rename `_add_variable_or_fallback` -> `var` to shorten line lengths.

There is a [thread on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/3ng87YVZjug) that complains about the failure in Debian of `import sage.all` from system Python.

To clarify, Debian doesn't change anything in `env.py` related to `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR`; the only fallback there is `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin` which does not contain the relevant scripts.  Instead, in `/usr/share/sagemath/bin/sage-env` they manually set `SAGE_ROOT=/usr/share/sagemath/` and `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR=/usr/share/sagemath/bin`. 

On Debian, I tried setting `SAGE_ROOT` to a garbage value in `sage-env`, and Sage still started and worked fine near as I can tell.

I can see it now. In vanilla sage `SAGE_SCRIPTS_DIR` is only set in sage-env and used to source `sage-env-config`. But I certainly know that debian has plan for that folder.

So as far as we can see, it would be fine to set `SAGE_ROOT` in `env.py`. But it could probably be left as is without impacting anything and doing `from sage import all` in python should work without setting it.

Looking at it there is one thing I have set `SAGE_ROOT` for! `sage/misc/copying.py` tries to access `SAGE_ROOT/COPYING.txt`. So its current value in sage-on-gentoo is just so that bit works :) I need to change that to be more conformant to Gentoo policies.

There is a somewhat harmless appearance of `SAGE_ROOT` in `sage/misc/citation.pyx`. There is a more disturbing one in `sage/misc/persist.pyx` where I would have used `DOT_SAGE` to be honest. The rest is mostly doctesting, packaging, doctests themselves and documentation strings.

No.

`SAGE_LIB` is supposed to be the installed location of Sage. I guess that by definition, Sage is run from its installed location. So if you know `sage.__file__`, you know the installed location of Sage.

If Sage is installed in `site-packages` (which is almost certainly the case), then the old value and new value for `SAGE_LIB` will be the same. In this case, there won't be any breakage.

If Sage is **not** installed in `site-packages`, then any existing code using `SAGE_LIB` to find the installed location of Sage is already broken.

Do you know any code which is using `SAGE_LIB` to find the path of something else besides `sage`?

Let's take some code from `sage/doctest/control.py`

```
F = x.__file__.replace(SAGE_LIB, SAGE_SRC)
```
It basically works because in both case you have to add `sage` to find what you want.

All the current code using `SAGE_LIB` is based on it mirroring `SAGE_SRC` by the look of it.

Nevertheless a change may be good. I'll certainly have a good look at what you proposing!

In `env.py` in the definition of `sage_include_directories` 

```
    if use_sources :
        include_directories.extend([SAGE_SRC,
                                    opj(SAGE_SRC, 'sage', 'ext')])

                                    opj(SAGE_LIB, 'sage', 'ext')])
```
since `SAGE_LIB` should now include `sage`, this should be changed unless there is something I don't get.

Heh, I think there's a decent excuse for that, but it's still definitely questionable.

Thanks anyways.  Just glancing over the rest of the diff this looks like a vast improvement.  I probably won't have a chance to test it out next week, but I want to try it on Cygwin.

This is definitely a vast improvement over the old version of this module.  If any further changes are needed for any reason we can add them in follow-up tickets (though if maintainers of any particular downstream packages want to chime in with their own comments feel free to set back to needs_work/needs_info).

Changing milestone to 8.7 as I don't think this is urgent: Most packagers already have their own patches to this module, and drastically changing it now is going to break those patches, only making this harder for getting an 8.6 release out.

On nix, the test

```
Verify that Sage can be started without any ``SAGE_`` environment
variables::

    sage: env = {k:v for (k,v) in os.environ.items() if not k.startswith("SAGE_")}
    sage: import subprocess
    sage: cmd = "from sage.all import SAGE_ROOT; print(SAGE_ROOT)"
    sage: res = subprocess.call(["python", "-c", cmd], env=env)  # long time
    None
```

breaks because maxima can't be found:

```
Failed example:
    res = subprocess.call(["python", "-c", cmd], env=env)  # long time
Expected:
    None

Is it the intention for that test to work in every environment? If its not, I think it is a step back.

That value for `SAGE_LOCAL` follows my own suggestion with suppose that sage and its software is all installed under the same "prefix". Of course in nix case that's a little bit different. In a way, it's a more general case.
