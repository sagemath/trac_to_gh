Having #25097 at hand, we can now look at more complicated constructions of polytopes. 

Perles and Grünbaum gave examples using Gale diagrams, see Section 5.4 of *Convex polytopes* of Grünbaum and Section 7 of *Lectures on Polytopes* of Ziegler.

Perles configuration and the *projective construction* of `sqrt(2)` (see Exercise 4 in §5.4) give several nice examples of non-rational polytopes.

This ticket provides these polytopes and explain the construction in a tutorial.
