```
In Sage 8.4 we had

```
sage: r.eval("graphics.off()")
''
sage: r.eval("""
....: 1
....: 2
....: """)
'[1] 1\n[1] 2'
```
in Sage 8.5 this gives

```
sage: r.eval("graphics.off()")
'NULL'
sage: r.eval("""
....: 1
....: 2
....: """)
'[1] 2'
```
which is annoying and inconsistent with the output one gets from R using these commands:

```
> graphics.off()
> 1
[1] 1
> 2
[1] 2
```
I've also seen this example in the documentation:

```
sage: r.png(filename='"%s"'%filename)             # optional -- rgraphics
NULL
```
which again I think is wrong - there should be no NULL output when saving a file.

As an example of why this NULL is annoying:

Also, if there were cells relying on multiple output from multiple commands, they behave differently now as well.

I agree this should definitely be fixed.

Incidentally, this is the opposite of what I did in the recent updates to the libgap interface (#22626): Previously, void-returning GAP functions would have their "return value" wrapped in a null `GapElement` that actually repr'd as `NULL` which was obviously annoying and distracting.  

In this case, the old behavior still returned an empty string, which still looks wrong to me.  It should check whether the expression in question has an actual return value or not, and if not then `r.eval` should just return `None`.

Right, thanks for reporting. The `eval` function actually just hands of to `rpy2`:

```
def eval(self, code, *args, **kwds):
    self._lazy_init()
    return str(robjects.r(code)).rstrip()
```

In this case `robjects.r("graphics.off()")` is `rpy2.rinterface.NULL`, which unfortunately is implemented to have a string representation of `NULL`. I'd argue this is an upstream bug bug since I think upstream doesn't want to do new python2 releases, we need to fix it ourselves here.

The fix should be trivial. Just add a `if result == rpy2.rinterface.NULL` to `eval`. However do you know why

```
sage: r.png(filename='"%s"'%filename)             # optional -- rgraphics
NULL
```

is different? I didn't touch that in my recent R changes, so that always returned NULL.

This looks like it could be simplified: If `result != NULL` then you always do `result = str(result)` anyways, so why not just move the `.rstrip()` into the statement in the `else:` block and get rid of the superfluous `isinstance(result, str)`?

I think I had a reason for that, but I can't remember it and I can't see any reason now. So it can probably be changed.

If you wanted a proper object, you'd use `__call__` instead: `r("42")`. Not sure why its done that way, I assume its just a symptom of having been a pexpect interface before. There it was natural to eval first and then translate to an object. Now we do it the other way around: get an object first, then produce a string if requested.

Gap does the same thing:

```
sage: type(gap.eval('42;'))
<type: 'str'>
```

I understand that the existing interface makes sense in light of its origin as a pexpect interface.

Right, I believe we talked about that before on the mailing list.  I understand that the existing interface makes sense in light of its origin as a pexpect interface.  Perhaps this should in fact be moved into `sage.lib` instead of `sage.interfaces` and updated to a more common interface, while deprecating the old interface.  Now that I think about it I think it should have been done that way in the first place, but I didn't speak up in time so oh well.  Could you please open a ticket for that?  I think we should make a stronger effort to be consistent.
