The ticket  #27607 introduced a regression: function field divisors are not hashable anymore! 

As of sage 8.8.beta7:              

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(GF(2)); R.<t> = K[]
sage: L.<y> = K.extension(t^3 + x^3*t + x)
sage: f = x/(y+1)
sage: f.divisor()     
- Place (1/x, 1/x^3*y^2 + 1/x)
 + Place (1/x, 1/x^3*y^2 + 1/x^2*y + 1)
 + 3*Place (x, y)
 - Place (x^3 + x + 1, y + 1)
sage: d = _
sage: {d: 1}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: <class 'sage.rings.function_field.divisor.DivisorGroup
_with_category.element_class'> is not hashable
