Just one other minor nit to pick (with the existing tests before this ticket):

```diff

with the Python 3 `print()` function (which I believe we are using in most modules on Python 2 as well), there's no need for explicit string concatenation with `+`.  The prints() in this test could be written like `print('current line:', blahblahblah)`.  I think we should promote more idiomatic code (even if in relatively minor tests that most users won't look at).

But don't bother unless you feel like it.

Be careful with `print` on Python2:

```
>>> print('a','b')
('a', 'b')
```
versus Python3:

```
>>> print('a', 'b')
a b
```
So I would not use the comma version in order to be Python2/3 compatible.

Well that's pretty strange even if with python2 you get that in sage console:

```
sage: from sage.libs.readline import *
sage: replace_line('foobar', 0)
sage: set_point(3)
sage: print('cursor position: ', get_point())
('cursor position: ', 3)
```

The doctest 

```
sage: print('cursor position: ', get_point())
cursor position: 3
```
still pass.

And for python3 the doctest framework doesn't seem to care if there is one or two spaces between `cursor position:` and `3`.

Even if it pass i think it's more clear and consistent to rollback to the `format` syntax.

We're using `from `__future__` import print_function` almost everywhere.  If there's a module that's not using it that's a mistake.

I'm not sure why it is because that's wrong.

For the doctests we are using the Python 3 print() function where possible.

But is it a good thing to use the `print('a', 'b')` syntax right now ?
