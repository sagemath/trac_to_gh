Which itself is not really a blocker (though it is a bad issue) except to the extent that it's a prerequisite to fixing #27214 which could also be argued is not a blocker, but it is a pretty severe problem the more and more I look at it.

We do care if the problem with conda-forge also exists on the computers of Sage users. At this point, I don't know if the build failure is specific to Conda (and I guess it's not).
