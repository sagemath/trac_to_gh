In `src/sage/databases/sql_db.py`, lines 465--467 currently read

```
            if query_dict['table_name'] not in skel:
                raise ValueError("Database has no table" \
                    + str(query_dict['table_name']) + ".")
```
but should instead read

```
            if query_dict['table_name'] not in skel:
                raise ValueError("database has no table %s"
                                 % query_dict['table_name'])
```

The current version in particular lacks a space between
"has no table" and the name, so errors look like:

```
File ...
Failed example:
    r = SQLQuery(DB, {'table_name':'simon'})
Exception raised:
...
ValueError: Database has no tablesimon.
```
instead of

```
File ...
Failed example:
    r = SQLQuery(DB, {'table_name':'simon'})
Exception raised:
...
ValueError: database has no table simon
```

At line 1400, one should also change

```
        if table_name in self.__skeleton__:
            raise ValueError('Database already has a table named' \
                + '%s.'%table_name)
```
to

```
        if table_name in self.__skeleton__:
            raise ValueError('database already has a table named %s'
                             %table_name)
```

As a beginner I'd like to fix this, if no one else's on it, of course. Is that okay?

I've never added a doctest before so this question might be a bit too simple. I've been reading the general conventions about writing tests but I'm not really sure about where should I add it. I thought I would just write it as a comment starting with something like this  

`Test that :trac:27562 is fixed::` 

and then just add the test itself.

Thank you!

Bea
