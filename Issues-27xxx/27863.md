This ticket adds a function to return, given a number and base, the sum of digits of that number in that base. For example, this enables:

```
sage: digit_sum(4412, b=10)
11
```

```
sage: digit_sum(4412, b=6)
12
```

There is no real advantage, although we thought it makes sense to have a dedicated sum of digits function implemented.

While we are at it, since `digits` is a method of Sage integers rather than a top-level function, maybe this should be also?

As an aside, it would have been more Pythonic if once upon a time, `digits` had been written to return an iterator rather than a list. But that would be a painful change to make now.

A related question: what are the disadvantages to the proposed function `digit_sum`? I don't know if this function is of enough general interest to warrant being defined at the top level, rather than being a method for integers and/or a function which has to be imported if you want to use it. There have been some efforts to remove underused items from the top-level name space (#25383), and I think there should be a good reason for adding a new one.

tl;dr: why not instead implement `4412.digit_sum(b=10)`?

As I commented earlier, if `n.digits` had been written in the first place to return an iterable rather than a list, then there would be no speed differential.

But maybe a better solution would to be modify `n.digits` to give it an optional argument to return that iterable. Then `sum(n.digits(b=10,iterable=True))` would be as fast as anything else.

And honestly, I think the use case for which this makes a difference is quite narrow.
