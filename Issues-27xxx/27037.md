The neighbor_iterator method does not give a correct error message when given a vertex that does not belong to the graph.
\\

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: list(g.neighbor_iterator(123))
LookupError: vertex (-1) is not a vertex of the graph
```

The issue is that '-1' is not the name of the vertex that we tried to
delete.

It is fixed.
I could not use check_vertex (because it does not exist for the object we have at this point), so I used a condition on has_vertex.

Now we have

```
sage: g.neighbors(-41)
LookupError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
...
LookupError: vertex (-41) is not a vertex of the graph
```
(same for neighbor_iterator, and also for digraphs)

I agree with your proposal. We can unfortunately not avoid calling twice `get_vertex` (`has_vertex` calls `get_vertex`).

Could you create `TESTS::` blocks for the doctests you have added?

<a id='comment:6'></a>
Thanks for your answers.

@dcoudert: Ah, I did not see that `has_vertex` calls `get_vertex`. It is possible to avoid calling twice `get_vertex` by doing the same check as in `has_vertex`:

```python
def iterator_in_nbrs(self, v):
    cdef int v_int = self.get_vertex(v)
    if not (v_int != -1 and bitset_in((<CGraph>self._cg).active_vertices, v_int)):
        # condition copied directly from has_vertex
        raise LookupError("vertex ({0}) is not a vertex of the graph".format(v))

    # rest of the function as before
```
Is it OK to use this conditional rather that calling `has_vertex`? (On the one hand we avoid a call to `get_vertex` but on the other hand if `has_vertex` changes in the future, nobody will think of updating the conditional here.)\\
Yes, I will create `TESTS::` blocks.

@tscrim: I compared the timings for the following code, with two cases depending whether the vertex exists in the graph.

```python
def t1(h):
    for i in range(50):
        try:
            l = h.neighbors(i)
        except LookupError:
            pass
```

I get the following results.\\
'Old' version (before this patch):

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 107 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 49.5 µs per loop
```

This patch:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 95.3 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 52.3 µs per loop
```

The version with only one call to `get_vertex` mentioned earlier in this message:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 92.1 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.5 µs per loop
```

It is not sufficient to check `v_int != -1`. Indeed, `get_vertex()` can return a value different from `-1` even if the requested vertex is not in the graph. See e.g., [#22374 comment:12](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22374#comment:12)

An option could be to add a method that, given the internal value associated to a vertex (i.e., the value returned by `get_vertex()`), check if it corresponds to an active vertex of the graph.

Another option could be to expand method `get_vertex()` with a parameter like `check_active` (default to `False`) that would raise an error if the vertex is not active.

The first option should avoid to slowdown the code.
