The neighbor_iterator method does not give a correct error message when given a vertex that does not belong to the graph.
\\

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: list(g.neighbor_iterator(123))
LookupError: vertex (-1) is not a vertex of the graph
```

The issue is that '-1' is not the name of the vertex that we tried to
delete.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

It is fixed.
I could not use check_vertex (because it does not exist for the object we have at this point), so I used a condition on has_vertex.

Now we have

```
sage: g.neighbors(-41)
LookupError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
...
LookupError: vertex (-41) is not a vertex of the graph
```
(same for neighbor_iterator, and also for digraphs)

Thank you for this patch. 
I agree with your proposal. We can unfortunately not avoid calling twice `get_vertex` (`has_vertex` calls `get_vertex`).

Could you create `TESTS::` blocks for the doctests you have added?

Thanks for your answers.

@dcoudert: Ah, I did not see that `has_vertex` calls `get_vertex`. It is possible to avoid calling twice `get_vertex` by doing the same check as in `has_vertex`:

```python
def iterator_in_nbrs(self, v):
    cdef int v_int = self.get_vertex(v)
    if not (v_int != -1 and bitset_in((<CGraph>self._cg).active_vertices, v_int)):
        # condition copied directly from has_vertex
        raise LookupError("vertex ({0}) is not a vertex of the graph".format(v))

    # rest of the function as before
```
Is it OK to use this conditional rather that calling `has_vertex`? (On the one hand we avoid a call to `get_vertex` but on the other hand if `has_vertex` changes in the future, nobody will think of updating the conditional here.)\\
Yes, I will create `TESTS::` blocks.

@tscrim: I compared the timings for the following code, with two cases depending whether the vertex exists in the graph.

```python
def t1(h):
    for i in range(50):
        try:
            l = h.neighbors(i)
        except LookupError:
            pass
```

I get the following results.\\
'Old' version (before this patch):

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 107 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 49.5 µs per loop
```

This patch:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 95.3 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 52.3 µs per loop
```

The version with only one call to `get_vertex` mentioned earlier in this message:

```
sage: g = Graph()
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 92.1 µs per loop
sage: g.add_vertices(range(50))
sage: %timeit t1(g)
10000 loops, best of 3: 48.5 µs per loop
```

It is not sufficient to check `v_int != -1`. Indeed, `get_vertex()` can return a value different from `-1` even if the requested vertex is not in the graph. See e.g., [#22374 comment:12](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/22374#comment:12)

An option could be to add a method that, given the internal value associated to a vertex (i.e., the value returned by `get_vertex()`), check if it corresponds to an active vertex of the graph.

Another option could be to expand method `get_vertex()` with a parameter like `check_active` (default to `False`) that would raise an error if the vertex is not active.

The first option should avoid to slowdown the code.

This does not make the code slower, according to the timings above.
