`uniq(X)` is just a shorthand for `sorted(set(X))`: I don't think that we need a separate function for that. More seriously, the sorting is problematic since arbitrary sets may not be sortable in general, especially in Python 3 or after applying #22029.

No. The existing `uniq()` sorts the list of objects, while `_stable_uniq()` keeps the existing order.

Ah, right, and the sorting of the output is documented. However, given the (eventual) goal, I think we should replace `uniq` with `_stable_uniq` and issue a deprecation warning about the sorting behavior change. Or at least in the current deprecation message say something like

```
the output of uniq(X) being sorted is deprecated; use sorted(set(X)) instead
if you want the output sorted
```
The current deprecation message seems to indicate that the function will be removed altogether.

`stable_uniq` does not sound discoverable or natural IMO. Also for those people who only want the `uniq` behavior, it means they would not have the change their code.

> Is there a good reason to call what's now `_stable_uniq` in a year's time `uniq`?


Someone might be relying on this sorting behavior in the wild, so we need to deprecate it.

OK, although I wouldn't be looking for `uniq` either.  In fact, I was surprised by it's documentation, because the well known unix utility does something else.

I was looking for `remove_duplicates` once, before it occurred to me that I want `set` :-)

> Someone might be relying on this sorting behavior in the wild, so we need to deprecate it.


I think that we all agree on that.
