Adding realloc and aligned_alloc to `MemoryAllocator`.

`realloc` is available in `cysignals.memory` anyway, so we might as well have it in `MemoryAllocator`.

`aligned_malloc` is useful for intrinsics, when memory up to 64-byte aligned is required. There are also similar functions in C, but its nice to have the memory taken care of by `MemoryAllocator`.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">comment:5</div>

This is mostly looking good. Just a few comments:

1. Can you also add `aligned_allocarray` and maybe `aligned_calloc` for completeness?

2. You could actually consider implementing the non-aligned functions as special case of the aligned functions.

3. You could add a small inline helper function (in the `.pxd` file) to implement the "lookup the pointer for realloc" feature. In that helper function, it would also be useful to support the special case of reallocating a `NULL` pointer, which would then work like a normal allocation.

4. What's the point of `cdef size_t align = alignment`

5. Add a test for the pointer-not-found case of `realloc`

6. Use Python 3 compatible `print()` syntax.

7. Remove the superfluous blank lines at the end of docstrings and use normal `"` quotes for exceptions.

I wanted to reserve an except value. It turns out that -1 would work just as good and is more natural.

There are never `max_size_t -1` objects around.

calloc functionality would be trivial to build on top of posix_memalign: a simply API conversion and zero out the memory block.

> or `realloc`. This branch implements also `aligned_calloc` and we could (but don't for now) implement also `aligned_realloc`.

Indeed, `realloc` in some cases might be more efficient because it could happen that the memory block doesn't need to be moved. Otherwise, a "malloc-memcpy-free" would do the same, so posix_memalign could be used as a primitive as well.

It looks to me you're paying a rather hefty penalty with the current design:
* you are wasting "alignment -1" memory for each allocation
* you are incurring overhead for storing pointers and looking them up in order to free the memory blocks.
A good implementation of posix_memalign that can work with the internals of the system malloc should be able to avoid both in most cases.

I doubt that the occasional "realloc" that might be satisfied without relocating the memory block will be worth paying the other penalties all the time.

Indeed, this is a penalty to pay. But if the alignment value is relatively small to the size of the allocation (which I expect to be the typical case), then it doesn't matter so much.

We're already doing that in `MemoryAllocator` before this ticket. So it's not worse than other usages of `MemoryAllocator` in that sense.
