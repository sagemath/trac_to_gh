My Ph.d. student was convinced that Sage's modular symbols only supports weight 2.  Why?  That's nuts.  But he showed me our docstring for `ModularSymbols?` and indeed it says the weight must be 2.  That's an unfortunate typo indeed!

I traced this back with git blame, and the problem was introduced by Mike Hansen when he was reformatting our docstrings to Sphinx and he changed  `>=` that I had written into an `=`.  It happens in at least two places in this commit:

https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/3917b3330171f71ba7f4257ba109ebabf4e97f3a#diff-ebe1d291e9fe46ac218031c382dcaadcL117

I bet it was an automated conversion script he wrote, and there might be incidences all over the Sage codebase potentially of `>=`'s converted to `=`'s.  There's at least two above.

Indeed, many `<` and `>` were lost in the commit you mention!

Maybe some fluke related to dealing with html tags?

As a consequence:
- this changed some `<=` into `<`, and some `>=` into `>`
- things like `if the weight is > 2` becoming `if the weight is 2`.

Some of that may have been restored over time, but certainly not all.
