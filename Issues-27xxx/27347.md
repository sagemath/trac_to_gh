Introduce lazy Laurent series to Sage.

A lazy Laurent series computes coefficients only when demanded or needed. In a sense, lazy Laurent series are Laurent series of infinite precision. 

A generating function example from the code:

```
Generating functions are laurent series over the integer ring::

    sage: from sage.rings.lazy_laurent_series_ring import LazyLaurentSeriesRing
    sage: L = LazyLaurentSeriesRing(ZZ, 'z')

This defines the generating function of Fibonacci sequence::

    sage: def coeff(s, i):
    ....:     if i in [0, 1]:
    ....:         return 1
    ....:     else:
    ....:         return s.coefficient(i - 1) + s.coefficient(i - 2)
    ....:
    sage: f = L.series(coeff, valuation=0); f
    1 + z + 2*z^2 + 3*z^3 + 5*z^4 + 8*z^5 + 13*z^6 + ...

The 100th element of Fibonacci sequence can be obtained from the generating
function::

    sage: f.coefficient(100)
    573147844013817084101 
```

Lazy Laurent series is of course useful for other things. This will be used to implement infinite precision Laurent series expansion of algebraic functions in function fields, as a sequel to #27418.

Do not have bare `except:` statements (see `coefficient`).

Does the elements pickle? I am a little worried that the addition of two power series will not pickling because of the little helper `add` function. You should add a `loads(dumps(foo))` test if it does work.

Typo `laurent` -> `Laurent` (it is proper noun).

This is how things are done for the Laurent polynomials. That way there is less duplication of code and improvements to one improve both.


I looked into the `LazyPowerSeriesRing` many years ago:

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-support/lazy$20power$20series%7Csort:date/sage-support/JZwDWKq3DtM/tyfxxdxPyXYJ

I think I didn't like it in several ways :-) Still I don't understand this behavior:

```
sage: L.<t>=LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: s=L([0,0,1,2])
sage: s.coefficient(0)
0
sage: s.coefficient(1)
0
sage: s.coefficient(2)
1
sage: s.coefficient(3)
2
sage: s
t^2 + 2*t^3 + O(x^4)
sage: s.get_order()
1
sage: s.get_aorder()
1
```

The reason was that it was easy to implement lazy laurent series with an interface and behaviors that I prefer, while I could not understand well enough `LazyPowerSeriesRing`... 

I would reconsider basing lazy laurent series on `LazyPowerSeriesRing`, if you help me understand the strange behaviour above.

So here is what `refine_aorder` does. It first checks if `self.order` has been set, if it has, do not do anything. Then it goes through all of the `n` computed entries **if `self.aorder` is 0** and we have already computed at least one entry. Then find the first nonzero entry. If we have found one, set the order.

The problem is the bold part. After the first iteration when `n = 1`, the `self.aorder` gets set to `1`, then on the second run through, that block does not get run, which then means `self.aorder < n` and we set the order to be `1`.

```
sage: s.coefficient(1)
0
sage: s.aorder
1
sage: s.order
Unknown series order
sage: s.coefficient(2)
1
sage: s.aorder
1
sage: s.order
1
```
IMO, this is a bug.

Fixed.

No. Your worry is real; lazy Laurent series is not picklable in general. This seems an inherent nature of my implementation...

I added a test to show this.

Right. Fixed.

Done.

I thought about this. Now I think:

Lazy Laurent series is not just about Laurent series but also about how coefficients are computed lazily. A `LazyPowerSeriesRing` element gets its coefficients from a stream object, which essentially yields coefficients as required. On the other hand, lazy Laurent series `s` gets its coefficients from a python function that outputs n-th coefficient  for input `s` and `n`. This allows coefficients to be computed recursively. For example, it is very easy to define the Fibonacci series. 

So it is impossible to base my lazy Laurent series code on `LazyPowerSeriesRing` without abandoning the essential feature of the implementation.

Frankly, I would rather provide new lazy power series as a subclass of my lazy Laurent series. But this is of course highly biased opinion :-)

You may be reluctant to accept my implementation of lazy Laurent series into `sage.rings` as it then gets kind of standard status among different possible implementations of lazy Laurent series in Sage. Then I am willing to relocate it into `sage.rings.function_field`.

I don't have an opinion on this matter, but there are likely some considerations required to replace or extend the current implementation.

This I don't really care about. I just am a little unhappy with the large difference between the semantics (and syntax) between the two implementations. I guess that is a bit unavoidable here because this definitely is serving a purpose.

However, I do think we should at least try to address the pickling issues. I believe this means you cannot use this in parallel implementations (IIRC this uses pickling to communicate between the processes). It also means you cannot (easily) store the data you compute. I think it is sufficient to separate out the `add` and similar operations into functions, but maybe they need to be small little helper class, such as

```python
class LaurentSeriesOperator(object):
    def __init__(self, lps, op):
        self.lps = lps
        self.op = op
    def __call__(self, s, n):
        return self.op(self.lps[n], s[n])
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (type(self), (self.lps, self.op), {})
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return (isinstance(other, LaurentSeriesOperator)
                and self.lps == other.lps and self.op == other.op)
```
where `op` is, e.g., `operator.add`. This way you might be able to do something with comparisons in some semi-reasonable capacity too.

You can do what I suggested in[comment:20](#comment%3A20) for these classes:
- `LazyLaurentSeriesOperator_add` (by passing `operator.add`)
- `LazyLaurentSeriesOperator_sub` (by passing `operator.sub`)
You're right that multiplication must be treated separately. Although you could also do this for a scalar multiplication version of this (which will be faster than coercion and multiplication). For 2 cases, there is a less compelling reason to factor the common code out like this.

There is not really a benefit for doing this for unitary operations (as there is only 1 that could work this way).

In some ways it feels like we are reinventing the wheel here because we are effectively building an evaluation tree, and we already have something like this within `SR` (or sympy/pynac/etc.). However, I don't see a way around this by using `SR` (and we might have to work a little bit to avoid doing computations unnecessarily inside of there). So I think we have to keep doing things this way. Just an observation.

Added scalar multiplication.

```
            sage: L = LazyPowerSeriesRing(QQ)

One question with respect to equality.  It seems to me that your implementation of `__eq__` is quite brittle.  It is clear that one cannot have proper equality, so it should be clearly stated what it can do and what it can't.

Some other comments on the code:

I think you should check the computed coefficients in that case to see if any of them are non-zero. If they are all `0`, then you should error out.

In `_repr_`, I do not see how `self.valuation()` would normally raise a `ValueError`. That method does not raise one, nor does `self.coefficient()` (the only other method it calls).

Instead of `self.parent()(1)`, which calls the coercion framework, you should use `self.parent().one()`.

Are you sure you want `_div_` to be two separate operations and not one combined one? I feel like the latter would be faster (at least since it is implemented at the Python level).

Actually, you may want to make the operator file into a Cython file (since is forms the key computational part and it is in a separate file).

I think the truncate should return an honest Laurent polynomial. Furthermore, I don't think there are coercions (or at least conversions) from the corresponding Laurent polynomial ring. This feels like a very natural to have. I don't want to go too far with ticket expansion, but this feels like something people will try soon after having this.

The implementation gives an answer if possible without computing coefficients indefinitely. Otherwise raise an exception.

I added a short explanation to the method.

Truncation still gives a lazy series. I added `polynomial` method to convert to an exact polynomial.
