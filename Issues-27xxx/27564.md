Currently, finding diameter and center of tree,etc. is only possible using method implemented for general graphs(having way higher time complexity than the ones which are specifically for trees). \\
I am proposing to implement a class for tree and implement tree specific algorithms there. And whenever we encounter a graph which is tree and there is some better algorithm to compute the asked property for tree than general graph, we convert that graph into instance of Tree and call the relevant algorithm.\\
There are a large number of algorithms for tree which have significantly less time complexity than algorithms for general graph. So, this can benefit a lot.\\
If the idea is agreed upon, I will be happy to send a diff.

For example, another possible use case I can think of is this:\\
Finding if two trees are isomorphic is possible in O(V) time, which is way better than general algorithm for graph isomorphism(no polynomial time solution for graph isomorphism yet found).\\

But implementing this algorithm in is_isomorphic() function will introduce lot of code clutter.

Added documentation and examples. I have included tree_isomorphism in is_isomorphic function. So, whenever G.is_isomorphic(H) is called and G and H are trees(and edge labels is false), isomorphism is checked using tree_isomorphism function. \\ 

I have tested the function by writing a script of generating some small random trees and comparing the output of tree_isomorphism and is_isomorphic. If anyone has a better idea, please suggest.

edge_labels=True case can also be handled using tree_isomorphism I think. I will send another diff once I implement it. \\ \\
 
I am not sure, if I should include tree_diameter() in diameter() functions, since currently it works on only unweighted trees. Same for tree_center.

```diff
-        if self.is_tree() and other.is_tree() and not edge_labels:
+        if not edge_labels and self.is_tree() and other.is_tree():
```


Method `tree_diameter`
- some code style improvements needed like

```diff
-    Returns diameter of unweighted tree.
-    Input:
+    Return the diameter of the unweighted tree.
+
+    INPUT:
```

```diff
-    - ``endpoints`` -- boolean(default: ``False``); whether to return
-    enpoints of diameter or not
+    - ``endpoints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return
+      enpoints of diameter or not
```

- it would be nice to document the algorithm used here ( a few sentences)

- this will break if `G` is empty: `u = next(G.vertex_iterator())`
- and also if the input graph is not a tree, is not connected, etc.

- instead of `shortest_path_lengths`, you must use `G.breadth_first_search(u, report_distance=True)`. You will then observe that the last reported distance is also the largest one.

- Why are you only considering unweighted graphs ?

Now, I have also added the compatibility for weighted trees. To avoid redundant code for finding shortest paths, I am using Dijkstra algorithm(so, using shortest_path_lengths). I know we can find it in linear time. But I don't think using dijkstra algorithm will affect performance that much. Or shall I write function for finding shortest_path_lenghts in trees?
>Why are you only considering unweighted graphs ?

Now, it is compatible for weighted graphs. But the given algorithm works only for non-negative weights for diameter. In case of center, positive weights since including 0 weight will imply that centers can lie on vertex other than diameter. \\

You should check the developer manual http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/ and in particular http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html

When we define a method, we have first a short (1 line) description of what the method returns. Then, separated by an empty line, we have a longer description, the input block, etc.

```
def tree_diameter(T, endpoints=False, path=False, by_weight=False):
    r"""
    Return the diameter of the tree `T`.

    This method use 2-sweep to compute the diameter of the tree `T`. That is,
    it first chooses some random vertex `x` and finds the most distant vertex
    `u` from `x`. The diameter of `T` is the largest distance from `u`.

    It works only on non-negative weighted trees.

    INPUT:

    - ``T`` -- a Graph
```

- Note that I use `r"""` instead of `"""` to indicate the use of latex. Indeed, you can ut latex code like <code>\`G\`</code> or <code>\`\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\`</code>.

- when an input is described on multiple lines, you must add 2 spaces

```diff
-    - ``endpoints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return
-    enpoints of diameter or not
+    - ``endpoints`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to return
+      enpoints of diameter or not
```


- Concerning the usage of weights, you can for instance check the documentation of method `shortest_path`. We usually allow to pass a `weight_function`.

- You can simplify you code as follows

```diff
+    if by_weight:
+        from operator import itemgetter
+        path_lengths = G.shortest_path_lengths(x, algorithm='Dijkstra_Boost', by_weight=True)
+        u = max(path_lengths.items(), key=itemgetter(1))[0]
+        path_lengths = G.shortest_path_lengths(u, algorithm='Dijkstra_Boost', by_weight=True)
+        (v, dist) = max(path_lengths.items(), key=itemgetter(1))
+    else:
+        for u in G.breadth_first_search(x):
+            pass
+        for v, dist in G.breadth_first_search(u, report_distance=True):
+            pass
```

- Note that it's better to use `.items()` instead of `.iteritems()` for Python 3 compatibility

I let you do the same for the other methods.
