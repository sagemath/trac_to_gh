```
For a polytope `P`, both `NormalFan(P)` and `P.normal_fan()` return the inner normal fan having the inner facet normals as rays. The outer normal fan, using the outer facet normals, is well-known, but not as easy to find in Sage.

As an example, create the polytope on p.193 of Ziegler's "Lectures on Polytopes" with its normal fan:

```
sage: V=[(-8,-4),(-8,6),(-4,-8),(0,-9),(0,6),(4,-8)]
sage: P=Polyhedron(V)
sage: NormalFan(P)
```

The result is the inner normal fan of `P`, which is the outer normal fan of `-P`.

This ticket adds to `Polyhedron.normal_fan` an argument `direction` set to either `'inner'` or `'outer'` to determine which of the directions to use. The default will stay `'inner'` in order to match the default of `NormalFan`. The description of `NormalFan` is extended by a hint to use `NormalFan(-P)` for the outer normal fan.

Additionally, this ticket adds in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation` a method `Inequality.outer_normal`.
This allows to obtain the outer normal vector without having to think about the appropriate sign of `Inequality.A()` whenever dealing with the facet inequalities of a polyhedron.

+1

I would leave the default as it is and add the `direction` argument to allow to get the variant.

This seems to already be possible for `Polyhedron` objects:

```
sage: p = polytopes.regular_polygon(5)
sage: p.vertices()
(A vertex at (0.5877852522924731?, -0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0.9510565162951536?, 0.3090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0, 1),
 A vertex at (-0.5877852522924731?, -0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (-0.9510565162951536?, 0.3090169943749474?))
sage: (-p).vertices()
(A vertex at (-0.5877852522924731?, 0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (-0.9510565162951536?, -0.3090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0, -1),
 A vertex at (0.587785252292474?, 0.8090169943749474?),
 A vertex at (0.9510565162951536?, -0.3090169943749474?))
```

Or you have something else in mind?

Yes, I would use `NormalFan(-P)`  or `NormalFan(P)` depending on whether one wants the inner or outer. This seems like the easiest thing to do. One does not need to go into the `Polyhedron` constructor...

I believe that the proposed change would be in the method `.normal_fan()` of `Polyhedron` objects, and not at the level of `NormalFan`, for the reason you mention.

That said, I would change the description of the ticket as follows:

> I propose to add to `normal_fan` an argument direction set to either `'outer'` or `'inner'` to determine which of the directions to use. The default will stay inner in order to match the default of `NormalFan`.


Above I would keep the current default.

> Additionally, I propose to add in sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation a method Inequality.outer_normal. This allows to obtain the outer normal vector without having to think about the appropriate sign of Inequality.A() whenever dealing with the facet inequalities of a polyhedron. 


This is good to me.

Further, I would suggest to add 

> Use `NormalFan(-P)` to get the outer normal fan.


in the documentation of `NormalFan`.

Yes. I stumbled upon this inner-outer issue through `Polyhedron.normal_fan()`. This is why I added jipilab in CC in the first place, and this is where I should have proposed to make `'outer'` the default – my bad. I'm fine with `'inner'` as default in both files. My main goal was easier access to outer normal fans, which is now available and explained in the docstrings.

- The optional parameters should receive an appropriate doctest. For example:

   {{{
sage: p = polytopes.regular_polygon(4,base_ring=QQ).pyramid()
sage: inner_nf = p.normal_fan()
sage: inner_nf.rays()
N( 1,  0,  0),
N(-1,  1,  1),
N(-1,  1, -1),
N(-1, -1, -1),
N(-1, -1,  1)
in 3-d lattice N

sage: outer_nf = p.normal_fan(direction='outer')
sage: outer_nf.rays()
N(-1,  0,  0),
N( 1,  1, -1),
N( 1,  1,  1),
N( 1, -1,  1),
N( 1, -1, -1)
in 3-d lattice N
}}}

- Further, it would be nice to disallow such things:

```
sage: outer_nf = p.normal_fan(direction='blabla')
```
   by checking that direction is one of the two allowed things (see the volume function for a similar handling).

- Remove the space before the semi-colon in the docstring of `normal_fan`.

I added a 2-d example testing inner, outer, and an invalid direction.

Great!

Could you do one change: the backtick in the error message should be a single quote.

I would also fix the title of the ticket and the description to reflect the actual changes involved.

+For a polytope `P`, both `NormalFan(P)` and `P.normal_fan()` return the inner normal fan having the inner facet normals as rays. The outer normal fan, using the outer facet normals, is well-known, but not as easy to find in Sage.
 
 As an example, create the polytope on p.193 of Ziegler's "Lectures on Polytopes" with its normal fan:
 
 ```
 sage: V=[(-8,-4),(-8,6),(-4,-8),(0,-9),(0,6),(4,-8)]
 sage: P=Polyhedron(V)
-sage: L=LatticePolytope(V)
-sage: FanP, FanL = NormalFan(P), NormalFan(L)
-sage: FanP == FanL
-True
+sage: NormalFan(P)
 ```
 
-The two fans are equal, but they are not the same as the one presented in Ziegler's book.
-In fact, following to the definition there, `FanP` and `FanL` give the normal fan of `-P`.
+The result is the inner normal fan of `P`, which is the outer normal fan of `-P`.
 
-The construction of `NormalFan(polytope)` uses the normal vectors of the facets, given by `polytope.facet_normals()` for a `LatticePolytope` 
-or given by `ieq.A() for ieq in polytope.inequalities()` for a `Polyhedron`.
-In both cases, the normal vectors obtained are directed towards the interior of the polytope. 
-Therefore, the resulting fan differs from what would be obtained when using the outer normal vectors instead.
+This ticket adds to `Polyhedron.normal_fan` an argument `direction` set to either `'inner'` or `'outer'` to determine which of the directions to use. The default will stay `'inner'` in order to match the default of `NormalFan`. The description of `NormalFan` is extended by a hint to use `NormalFan(-P)` for the outer normal fan.

-I propose to add to `Polyhedron.normal_fan` an argument `direction` set to either `'inner'` or `'outer'` to determine which of the directions to use. The default will stay `'inner'` in order to match the default of `NormalFan`.

-Additionally, I propose to add in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation` a method `Inequality.outer_normal`.
+Additionally, this ticket adds in `sage.geometry.polyhedron.representation` a method `Inequality.outer_normal`.
 This allows to obtain the outer normal vector without having to think about the appropriate sign of `Inequality.A()` whenever dealing with the facet inequalities of a polyhedron.
