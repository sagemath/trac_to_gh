Trying to build sage using its own build system with gmp present results in:

```
Package 'flint' is currently not installed
No legacy uninstaller found for 'flint'; nothing to do
Configuring FLINT.
Invalid GMP directory
```

Flint fails to build. Looking into its configure script, it looks for GMP in `/usr/local` or whatever was passed as `--with-gmp` at configure time. However gmp is located in `/usr`, not `/usr/local`. Sage passes the contents of the `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` variable to `--with-gmp`, but according to the install logs that environment variable is empty (while `SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE` is set correctly):

```
SAGE_EXTCODE=/home/timo/repos/sage/local/share/sage/ext
SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE=///usr/include
SAGE_GMP_PREFIX=
SAGE_LOCAL=/home/timo/repos/sage/local
SAGE_LOGS=/home/timo/repos/sage/logs/pkgs
```

Is this specifically on NIX or something?  I don't have this problem on Cygwin or Linux.

Possible of course, but this is in a bind mount specifically for building sage using its own build system. So I'd at least be a little surprised.

Does gmp happen to be located in `/usr/local` for you?

> Sage passes the contents of the `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` variable to `--with-gmp`

I don't think that's quite accurate.  Looking at the version of #27212 that was finally merged, flint is configured like:

```
./configure ... $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP ...
```

where `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP` is a variable defined in `src/bin/sage-env-config` as

```
if [ -n "$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX" ]; then
    export SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP="--with-gmp=$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX"
fi
```

That is, if `$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` is empty then `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP` should be undefined.

In any case, I can confirm that as you say, flint's hand-written `configure` script just always defaults its `GMP_DIR` variable to `GMP_DIR=/usr/local` (even if `--prefix`) is set to something else.  This is buggy.

It's not normally a problem because the way it uses `GMP_DIR`, everything will still work if GMP can be picked up through the standard paths.  But the `configure` script errors out with the error you reported if, say, `/usr/local/lib` does not exist.

I would say this is a bug in flint, but one we can possibly work around if need be.  In the meantime you can try to work around it by setting the environment variable `export FLINT_CONFIGURE=--with-gmp=/usr`

It does determine it "correctly" by not making any assumptions about it at all.  All we know from autoconf is that a usable GMP is on the system.  There's not necessarily any notion of a "GMP prefix" because for all we know the GMP headers could be `/foo/include` and the library in `/bar/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`.

In other words, we don't make any assumptions about the system's filesystem layout or how it relates to where headers and libraries are found.  We can only do that in certain narrow cases such as when using Sage SPKGs, in which case we have control over exactly where and how they're installed.

How does it determine that if it doesn't locate it?

What is the purpose of sages `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`, `SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE` then?

The same way most autoconf scripts determine this: If it can compile with `#include <gmp.h>` and link something containing symbols from libgmp with `-lgmp` then it works.  The script itself doesn't have to know "where" those things come from as that depends on the toolchain and compiler/linker flags.

They are used specifically when using the gmp or mpir SPKGs from Sage in which case these do have meaningful values that need to be passed to other packages' configure scripts.  See again #27212.
