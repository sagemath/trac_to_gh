It turns out that there is a crazy corner case left due to #27267: if a big nested deallocation occurs which was triggered by the deallocation of an instance of a Python class, the trashcan is not cleaned up: the deallocation ends but not every object is actually deallocated. Allocating a cypari2 `Gen` right after this causes cypari2 to be in an inconsistent state, since it assumes that all `Gen`s on the PARI stack have actually been deleted.

This needs several patches:
- https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12730 (3.7) and https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12699 (2.7), both backports of https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11841
- https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12725 (2.7 only)

Don't be so pessimistic. The crash with cypari2 used to be really bad. It seems that they at least acknowledge the bug. Patching python2 with a non-accepted upstream patch is a very delicate situation...

```

Are these harmless?  I had assumed they were connected with the underlying issue here, but perhaps not.  I will also do this test with Python 2 and report back.

> Those warnings are worrying but maybe they are unrelated to the trashcan.

The warnings also manifest under Python 2.  I checked to see which doctests trigger them, and found that the problem can easily be reproduced by:

```
sage: import snappy
sage: M = snappy.Manifold('m004')
sage: M.high_precision()

  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
```
Turning warnings into exceptions to try to identify the source, I get the following message followed by a hard SIGSEGV crash:

```

Unfortunately, these warnings happen during deallocation (think of `__del__` in Python), so exceptions are not supported there. That's also the reason why `ERROR: removing wrong instance of Gen` is printed rather than raising an exception.

This is a pure bug-fix. Adding this patch doesn't make it any harder to support Sage without this patch, so I don't think that it's delicate.

It indeed seems not to affect Sage doctests.

<a id='comment:21'></a>
Sadly, some parts of this issue have not been completely dealt with.  Here is a simple example
(with Sage 8.8 on Ubuntu 18.04):

```
sage: z = complex(pari('1+1*I'))
/XXX/sage-8.8/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2878:
RuntimeWarning: cypari2 leaked 48 bytes on the PARI stack
  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
```

I think the core issue here is that the stack management code in cypari2/stack.pyx is
fundamentally unsafe.

Here is the situation, as I understand it.

* Cypari2 allows a PARI GEN which is wrapped by a Gen object to reside either on the PARI stack
  or on the heap, but the stack is preferred.

* The PARI stack is also used by PARI, for example to store intermediate values produced when
  evaluating PARI expressions.  This means that there will be non-wrapped GENS on the PARI stack.  
  Typically one should expect a block of non-wrapped GENS between each pair of adjacent wrapped
  GENS as well as some non-wrapped GENS that were pushed after the last wrapped GEN.

* When a Gen object is deallocated, and if it was the last Gen to have had its GEN X pushed onto
  the PARI stack, then reset_avma is called to set PARI's avma stack pointer to the address of
  the penultimate wrapped GEN Y.  Any non-wrapped GEN pushed after Y will be lost.  This is
  dangerous, because those lost GENS could be clobbered the next time that PARI pushes a GEN.
  That, of course, is the reason for the warning.  Note, though, that the warning is only
  triggered if there are non-wrapped GENS which were pushed after X.  Losing the GENs between
  X and Y is just as dangerous but does not trigger a warning.

I don't see any way to make this scheme safe.  I don't see any reliable way to control when PARI
will push GENS on its stack since, for example, Sage allows execution of arbitrary GP code.
And I don't see any reliable way to control when Sage Gens will be deallocated.  Presumably the
idea of storing wrapped GENS on the PARI stack was intended to be an optimization.  I think
it would be better to forego this optimization in favor of safety.  However, if the optimization
does provide significant performance increases then I would suggest that it be made optional.
A Gen object could store its GEN on the heap by default, but allow as an option that the GEN be
stored on the PARI stack.  That way people who were willing to risk crashes in order to increase
speed would be able to do so while the rest of us could safely store our GENs on the heap.
