This ticket introduces graphics insets, i.e. it allows to have various `Graphics` objects at arbitrary locations and sizes on a single figure. Previously, only graphics arrays, i.e. `Graphics` objects arranged in a regular array, were possible. 

This is made possible thanks to the generic class `MultiGraphics` introduced in #27865.
The user interface is constituted of three new functions:
- the method `Graphics.inset()`, which adds an inset to a given graphics; see this [preview example](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/plotting/sage/plot/graphics.html#sage.plot.graphics.Graphics.inset)
- the method `MultiGraphics.inset()`, which adds an inset to a multi-graphics (e.g. a `GraphicsArray`); see this [preview example](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/plotting/sage/plot/multigraphics.html#sage.plot.multigraphics.MultiGraphics.inset)
- the function `multi_graphics()` , which creates a figure from a list of `Graphics` objects at user-specified locations; see this [preview example](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/preview/graphics_inset/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html#sage.plot.plot.multi_graphics)


Depends on #27865

> **Edit:** To be more precise, the inset has the correct size relative to the final image, but not in relation to the main graphics.

Actually, this is a feature, not a bug. From the documentation returned by `g1.inset?`:

```
Signature:      g1.inset(graphics, pos=None, fontsize=None)
Docstring:     
   Add a graphics object as an inset.

   INPUT:

   * "graphics" -- the graphics object (instance of "Graphics") to
     be added as an inset to the current graphics

   * "pos" -- (default: "None") 4-tuple "(left, bottom, width,
     height)" specifying the location and size of the inset on the
     figure, all quantities being in fractions of the figure width and
     height; if "None", the value "(0.70, 0.68, 0.2, 0.2)" is used

   * "fontsize" -- (default: "None")  integer, font size (in points)
     for the inset; if "None", the value of 6 points is used, unless
     "fontsize" has been explicitely set in the construction of
     "graphics" (in this case, it is not overwritten here)

   OUTPUT:

   * instance of "MultiGraphics"

```
As you can see, the argument `pos` specifies the position and size of the inset relative to the figure size. So, with `pos=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)`, as in your example `g2`, one obtains an inset that has half the figure width and half the figure height. Do you think that the documentation should be improved about this?

I've changed the rescaling of the base plot when generating the `MultiGraphics` object, the previous values were indeed shrinking `g1` too much. The new output is in the attached figure `g2_new.png`.

The position/size given in the argument `pos` regard the position/size of the frame box of the inset with respect to the final plotting area (canvas), not with respect to `g1`. This is a feature we should keep IMHO, since it matches with Matplotlib conventions, cf. the argument `rect` in the method `Figure.add_axes` at https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.figure.Figure.html.

For example, in `g4` the blue squares touch each other in one direction, but not the other. I am not sure what the preferred behaviour is in this case, but it should be the same in both directions.\n\n```\ng1 = plot(x^3, x, -1, 1, aspect_ratio=1, color='red', frame=True)\ng1.axes_color('red')\nc = circle((0,1000), 1, frame=True, aspect_ratio=1, transparent=True)\nc.axes_color('blue')\ng4 = g1.inset(c, (0,0,.5,.5)).inset(c, (0,.5,.5,.5)).inset(c, (.5,0,.5,.5)).inset(c, (.5,.5,.5,.5))\n```\n\n![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket27866/g4.png)\n\n---\n\nMoreover, some of the type checks testing for lists and tuples seem a bit restrictive. Especially this one is not necessary, as the implementation will work for any iterable and iterator, so the type check should just be removed:\n\n```\n        if not isinstance(graphics_list, (list, tuple)):\n            raise TypeError(\"graphics_list must be a list or a tuple, \"\n                            \"not {}\".format(graphics_list))\n```\n\n---\n\nI am not sure why the following change is needed. Would it be better to test for the converse, i.e. `if not isinstance...` of the types you want to exclude? Or are `Graphics` and `GraphicsArray` the only types that support `tight_layout`? Also, there is a similar change in multigraphics.py that only tests for `isinstance(self, GraphicsArray)`.

There still seems to be an inconsistency between vertical and horizontal positioning. For example, in `g4` the blue squares touch each other in one direction, but not the other. I am not sure what the preferred behaviour is in this case, but it should be the same in both directions.

```
g1 = plot(x^3, x, -1, 1, aspect_ratio=1, color='red', frame=True)
g1.axes_color('red')
c = circle((0,1000), 1, frame=True, aspect_ratio=1, transparent=True)
c.axes_color('blue')
g4 = g1.inset(c, (0,0,.5,.5)).inset(c, (0,.5,.5,.5)).inset(c, (.5,0,.5,.5)).inset(c, (.5,.5,.5,.5))
```

Moreover, some of the type checks testing for lists and tuples seem a bit restrictive. Especially this one is not necessary, as the implementation will work for any iterable and iterator, so the type check should just be removed:

```
        if not isinstance(graphics_list, (list, tuple)):
            raise TypeError("graphics_list must be a list or a tuple, "
                            "not {}".format(graphics_list))
```

I am not sure why the following change is needed. Would it be better to test for the converse, i.e. `if not isinstance...` of the types you want to exclude? Or are `Graphics` and `GraphicsArray` the only types that support `tight_layout`? Also, there is a similar change in multigraphics.py that only tests for `isinstance(self, GraphicsArray)`. If you think it is preferable to keep this as is, that would also be fine be me.

```diff
-            # tight_layout adjusts the *subplot* parameters so ticks aren't
-            # cut off, etc.
-            figure.tight_layout()
+            if isinstance(graphics, (sage.plot.graphics.Graphics,
+                                     sage.plot.multigraphics.GraphicsArray)):
+                # for Graphics and GraphicsArray, tight_layout adjusts the
+                # *subplot* parameters so ticks aren't cut off, etc.
+                figure.tight_layout()
```

Other than that, everything looks good to me.
