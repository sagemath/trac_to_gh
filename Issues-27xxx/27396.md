[libsemigroups](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups) is a C++ library for computing in semigroups, and is used by semigroups GAP package, which is to be included in Sage, cf. #27295

So this automatically gives it rights to become an optional package.

I don't quite understand the point you are trying to make here. This ticket is a dependency of #27295, which is for exactly this, adding  GAP's semigroups package.

No, not here. Adding python bindings should be on another ticket.
