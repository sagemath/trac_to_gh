[libsemigroups](https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups) is a C++ library for computing in semigroups, and is used by semigroups GAP package, which is to be included in Sage, cf. #27295

So this automatically gives it rights to become an optional package.

tarball: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/libsemigroups-0.6.7.tar.gz

To the release manager, merge simultaneous with #27295.

Depends on #28088

CC:  @nthiery @isuruf

Keywords: **GAP packages, semigroups**

I don't quite understand the point you are trying to make here. This ticket is a dependency of #27295, which is for exactly this, adding  GAP's semigroups package.
