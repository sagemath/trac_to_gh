CC:  @kiwifb @embray

The top-level `configure` writes `src/bin/sage-env-config`. However, the file `local/bin/sage-env-config` is what is actually used by the build system. At some point during the build, `src/bin/sage-env-config` is copied to `local/bin/sage-env-config` but this does not happen immediately. This leads to race conditions where packages may be built with the wrong `sage-env-config`.

A very simple solution is to prefer `src/bin/sage-env-config` in case that both are present.

But the `auto` is new C++, how did it work before? Is it because this sets C++ to too old a standard?

Before #26787, these packages were compiled with `-std=c++11`. So the obvious fix is simply to put back those flags which were removed in #26787.

Francois says on #26787 that it's meant to be that CXX becomes `$CXX -std=gnu++11` But somehow this does not happen here for some reason.

Could you post the `sage-env-config` from one of these broken systems here?

The glob `build/pkgs/*/*` in the `build/make/Makefile` target should indeed trigger it. At least that's what we expect. But you should have logs showing whether it happened or not.

I think there is a misunderstanding.

The problem is when *both* `local/bin/sage-env-config` and `src/bin/sage-env-config` are present. It used to prefer `local/bin/sage-env-config` which is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. Instead, it should prefer `src/bin/sage-env-config` which is directly generated by `configure`.

I went for the most simple solution here. There are probably better solutions, for example having only one such file. But those require bigger changes and I didn't want to do that for a blocker ticket.

Imho its better to ship 8.7 now, realistically we can't make any promises about upgrading from old versions.

OK, fine, but why does this even get copied into `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/`?

Its place is not there, not in somewhere that is in the `$PATH`.
but rather in something like `$SAGE_LOCAL/config/` or so...

I hope this explains.

When running `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage` for example, it uses `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env`, which in turn should source `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config` (which just sets a few variables that are determined by `./configure` and are placed in a separate file from the main `sage-env` mostly for clarity's sake...)

No, this is in `src/bin/sage-env-config`, that's how you can find it.

Do you say that `sage -i` doesn't work if `./configure --prefix=X` was run with `X != $SAGE_LOCAL`?
