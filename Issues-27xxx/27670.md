```
For example, while installing the kash3 package, the output includes the following lines:

```
usage: sage-spkg-uninstall [-h] [-v] [-k] spkg [sage_local]
sage-spkg-uninstall: error: argument spkg: invalid spkg_type value: 'kash3'
```

This is due to the uninstall script throwing incorrect error types. 
After applying this ticket's patch, the output reads:

```
usage: sage-spkg-uninstall [-h] [-v] [-k] spkg [sage_local]
sage-spkg-uninstall: error: argument spkg: 'kash3' is not a known spkg
```

Which is at least more sensible.  `kash3` is not known because it is an old-style package that didn't create a directory in `build/pkgs`.

<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

This fix makes sense in its own right so +1.

Support for old-style SPKGs is deprecated and should be removed completely.

The only reason it hasn't been completely removed is last time the question came up there was paralysis about what to do about one particularly large package that would need to be hosted somewhere if it were converted to a new-style SPKG.

In that case it was just a large database, and is so large in fact that I'm not convinced downloading the whole database is the right thing to do in most cases anyways. It should be wrapped in a little queryable web service hosted online somewhere (perhaps even sagemath.org). Someone just needs to do that. I don't think that one package is reason enough to hold up removal of old-style SPKG support though.
