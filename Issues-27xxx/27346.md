<a id='comment:10'></a>I removed it, because with python3 it surprisingly gave `True`, but more importantly, because I think it is not very interesting.  When I implemented all this, I was not sure how to structure the various results returned by findstat.  I now know a little better, and I have plans for a much better interface, but not really the time right now.

If you insist, I can mark the doctest as random.
