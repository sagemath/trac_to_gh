Minimal weight cycle basis is a cycle basis for which the total weight of all the cycles is minimum.

Its applications are as follows:
- The minimum weight cycle basis of a nearest neighbor graph of points sampled from a three-dimensional surface can be used to obtain a reconstruction of the surface.

- In cheminformatics, the minimal cycle basis of a molecular graph is referred to as the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR).

This ticket will aim at implementing this algorithm.

minimum weight cycle basis in a graph with m edges and n vertices can be found in polynomial time using https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-007-9064-z. 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1208.pdf

I am going through these algorithms before implementing it.

These work for undirected(weighted/non-weighted) graphs without multiedges.

I had a doubt regarding what should we add in examples when getting deprecation warning from external package. like below:

```
sage: g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=True, algorithm="NetworkX")

DeprecationWarning: connected_component_subgraphs is deprecated and will be removedin 2.2. Use (G.subgraph(c).copy() for c in connected_components(G))
            [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
```
 should we skip these examples in examples section?

A first round of comments. 

`min_cycle_basis`:
- remove input parameter "algorithm"

- in many methods, we are using a mapping from integers to vertices. This is simply `cdef list int_to_vertex = list(G)`. The reverse mapping is then `cdef dict vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}`.

- To simplify and speed up your code, you should either make a copy of `self` in which vertices are relabeled in `0..n-1`, or at least relabel the edges in `edgelist` using integers. The only step were you need the real vertex ids is before returning the result.

- You could work with edges as frozenset directly

- don't import `from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import johnson_shortest_paths` inside a loop



`minimum_cycle_basis`:
- I don't see the need for creating a new method here. You could add parameters to `cycle_basis` to make it return a minimum cycle basis when the user asked for it ?

It seems SparseGraphBackend object is not iterable so we cant do list(self)

[UPDATE]
So I did this

```
        cdef list int_to_vertex = list(self.iterator_verts(None))
        cdef dict vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}
```

   2458         cdef list orth_set = [set([e]) for e in edges_complement]

   2460         cdef dict vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}
   2461         if not by_weight:

```

The parameters of cycle_basis and minimum_cycle_basis are quite different as in cyclebasis we just specify the output as vertices or edges but in min_cycle_basis we have algorithm parameter and weight parameters too. If they are merged it will mess a bit.(just my opinion). But if it seems better than I can do it.

<div id="comment:15" align="right">comment:15</div>

I agree with your arguments.

In your code, you code document a bit the type of graph you build, and so why you use `n+j` or `n + vidx`.

I'm a bit worried about the following lines because I don't know what you expect

```
+            new_cycle = {frozenset((int_to_vertex[u], int_to_vertex[v])) for u, v in edges}
+            cycle_basis.append(list(set().union(*new_cycle)))
```
With such operation, you loose the order of the vertices, so I don't see how you get a cycle.

I think the following is better, but it is only because I'm not sure how list manipulation is really done for sure instructions.

```diff
-            orth_set[i + 1:] = [o ^ base if len(o & new_cycle) % 2 else o for o in orth_set[i + 1:]]
+            for j in range(i + 1, len(orth_set)):
+                orth_set[j] = o ^ base if len(o & new_cycle) % 2 else o
```

also

```diff
+                edges_c = [frozenset(e) for e in comp.edges(labels=False) if e not in edges_s]
+                edges_c = [frozenset(e) for e in comp.edge_iterator(labels=False) if e not in edges_s]
```

What if the input graph has loops ? If not accepted, then use `self._scream_if_not_simple()`.

```

```diff
-            # Add 2 copies of each edge in self to T. Cross edge is added if
-            # edge is in orth otherwise in-plane edge is added
+            # For each edge in self, add 2 edges to G: "cross" edges if
+            # edge is in orth otherwise "in-plane" edges
```


No need for `list(..)`

```diff
-            for edge in list(zip(min_path_nodes[:-1], min_path_nodes[1:])):
+            for edge in zip(min_path_nodes[:-1], min_path_nodes[1:]):
```

Here an alternative is to use `chain`. You need to add before the loop `from itertools import chain`. I don't know if it's faster...

```diff
             new_cycle = {frozenset((int_to_vertex[u], int_to_vertex[v])) for u, v in edges}
-            cycle_basis.append(list(set().union(*new_cycle)))
+            cycle_basis.append(list(set(chain(*new_cycle))))
```


**minimum_cycle_basis**
- same comments than above for improving the text
- don't use this as plain text `minimum_cycle_basis` in documentation.

```diff
-          * If ``algorithm = "NetworkX"``, a networkx implementation of the
-            minimum_cycle_basis algorithm is used
-
-          * If ``algorithm = None``, then cython implementation of the
-            minimum_cycle_basis algorithm is used
+          * If ``algorithm = "NetworkX"``, use networkx implementation
+
+          * If ``algorithm = None``, use Sage Cython implementation
```
- make `edge_s` a set to speed up construction of `edges_c`

```diff
+                edges_s = [(a, b) for a, b, c in sp_edges]
+                edges_s = set((a, b) for a, b, c in sp_edges)
```
- `compliment` -> `complement`
- In fact, this is better

```diff
-                # compliment of the edges of the spanning tree with respect
-                # to self
+                # Edges of self that are not in the spanning tree
```

Yes you are right I was misunderstanding the definition of chain.


```
sage: n = {(1,2),(3,4),(1,4),(5,6),(6,8),(6,4)}
sage: %timeit list(set().union(*n))
The slowest run took 11.81 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.53 µs per loop
sage: %timeit list(set(chain(*n)))
The slowest run took 6.35 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.58 µs per loop

Although not much difference but union is slightly more better than chain here.

- <code>\`self\`</code> -> <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>  (twice)

- what happen when `edges_complement` is None ?

- you should document the fact that in `edges_complement`, edges are pairs without labels, and in fact frozensets. In fact, it might be better to compute `edges_complement` inside `min_cycle_basis` to avoid errors in the input.

- a possible improvement could be to do

```
cdef list edgelist = list(self.iterator_unsorted_edges(list(self.iterator_verts(None)), True))
cdef list edgelist_int = [(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1], weight_function(e)) for e in edgelist]
cdef list orth_set = [set([(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1])]) for e in edges_complement]
```
  this way, inside the main loops you work only with integers and precomputed weights. Finally, you reconstruct the correct cycle basis before returning it.

  You can then do `for e in edgelist:` -> `for uidx, vidx, edge_w in edgelist_int:`

  Think about it.

It should return an empty list. I added it in this commit to avoid process further.

In new_cycle we have original vertices so we can't convert vertex to int in orth_set before as they have to be bitwise and with new_cycle as indicated above.

I added some examples with networkx plus a few corrections.

In `min_cycle_basis`, can we avoid input parameter `edges_complement` and so compute a spanning tree inside the method. Is it important to have this input parameter ?

Since we now have sage graph inside min_cycle_basis , edges_complement can now be computed inside our method , no need to pass it as a parameter.
I will do the required change.

I just tried the the patch with Python3 and we have some issues to fix. This is mostly ordering issues as for instance the order of the keys of a dictionary is not always the same in Python 2 and Python 3.

For instance, I get:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 4679, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.minimum_cycle_basis
Failed example:
    g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=True)
Expected:
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
Got:
    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 4681, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.minimum_cycle_basis
Failed example:
    g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=False)
Expected:
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
Got:
    [[1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
```


So, I suggest to use `sorted(g.minimum_cycle_basis(...))` in all examples, and possibly
`sorted(sorted(c) for c in g.minimum_cycle_basis(...))`. This last one might be too much, but...
