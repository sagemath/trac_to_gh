Minimal weight cycle basis is a cycle basis for which the total weight of all the cycles is minimum.

Its applications are as follows:
- The minimum weight cycle basis of a nearest neighbor graph of points sampled from a three-dimensional surface can be used to obtain a reconstruction of the surface.

- In cheminformatics, the minimal cycle basis of a molecular graph is referred to as the Smallest Set of Smallest Rings (SSSR).

This ticket will aim at implementing this algorithm.

minimum weight cycle basis in a graph with m edges and n vertices can be found in polynomial time using https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-007-9064-z. 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.1208.pdf

I am going through these algorithms before implementing it.

These work for undirected(weighted/non-weighted) graphs without multiedges.

I had a doubt regarding what should we add in examples when getting deprecation warning from external package. like below:

```
sage: g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=True, algorithm="NetworkX")

DeprecationWarning: connected_component_subgraphs is deprecated and will be removedin 2.2. Use (G.subgraph(c).copy() for c in connected_components(G))
            [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
```
 should we skip these examples in examples section?

A first round of comments. 

`min_cycle_basis`:
- remove input parameter "algorithm"

- in many methods, we are using a mapping from integers to vertices. This is simply `cdef list int_to_vertex = list(G)`. The reverse mapping is then `cdef dict vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}`.

- To simplify and speed up your code, you should either make a copy of `self` in which vertices are relabeled in `0..n-1`, or at least relabel the edges in `edgelist` using integers. The only step were you need the real vertex ids is before returning the result.

- You could work with edges as frozenset directly

- don't import `from sage.graphs.base.boost_graph import johnson_shortest_paths` inside a loop



`minimum_cycle_basis`:
- I don't see the need for creating a new method here. You could add parameters to `cycle_basis` to make it return a minimum cycle basis when the user asked for it ?

It seems SparseGraphBackend object is not iterable so we cant do list(self)

[UPDATE]
So I did this

```
        cdef list int_to_vertex = list(self.iterator_verts(None))
        cdef dict vertex_to_int = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(int_to_vertex)}
```

I agree with your arguments.

In your code, you code document a bit the type of graph you build, and so why you use `n+j` or `n + vidx`.

I'm a bit worried about the following lines because I don't know what you expect

```
+            new_cycle = {frozenset((int_to_vertex[u], int_to_vertex[v])) for u, v in edges}
+            cycle_basis.append(list(set().union(*new_cycle)))
```
With such operation, you loose the order of the vertices, so I don't see how you get a cycle.

I think the following is better, but it is only because I'm not sure how list manipulation is really done for sure instructions.

```diff
-            orth_set[i + 1:] = [o ^ base if len(o & new_cycle) % 2 else o for o in orth_set[i + 1:]]
+            for j in range(i + 1, len(orth_set)):
+                orth_set[j] = o ^ base if len(o & new_cycle) % 2 else o
```

also

```diff
+                edges_c = [frozenset(e) for e in comp.edges(labels=False) if e not in edges_s]
+                edges_c = [frozenset(e) for e in comp.edge_iterator(labels=False) if e not in edges_s]
```

What if the input graph has loops ? If not accepted, then use `self._scream_if_not_simple()`.

+                edges_s = set((a, b) for a, b, c in sp_edges)
```
- `compliment` -> `complement`
- In fact, this is better

```diff
-                # compliment of the edges of the spanning tree with respect
-                # to self
+                # Edges of self that are not in the spanning tree
```

- <code>\`self\`</code> -> <code>\`\`self\`\`</code>  (twice)

- what happen when `edges_complement` is None ?

- you should document the fact that in `edges_complement`, edges are pairs without labels, and in fact frozensets. In fact, it might be better to compute `edges_complement` inside `min_cycle_basis` to avoid errors in the input.

- a possible improvement could be to do

```
cdef list edgelist = list(self.iterator_unsorted_edges(list(self.iterator_verts(None)), True))
cdef list edgelist_int = [(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1], weight_function(e)) for e in edgelist]
cdef list orth_set = [set([(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1])]) for e in edges_complement]
```
  this way, inside the main loops you work only with integers and precomputed weights. Finally, you reconstruct the correct cycle basis before returning it.

  You can then do `for e in edgelist:` -> `for uidx, vidx, edge_w in edgelist_int:`

  Think about it.

```
cdef list orth_set = [set([(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1])]) for e in edges_complement]
```
this will throw an error as edges_complement being a frozenset can't be indexed.

**
what happen when edges_complement is None ?** 

It should return an empty list. I added it in this commit to avoid process further.

I tried doing 

```
cdef list orth_set = [set([(vertex_to_int[e[0]], vertex_to_int[e[1])]) for e in edges_complement]
```

before converting to frozenset but got some unexpected errors. Will see if it can be added.

We have 

```
            new_cycle = {frozenset((int_to_vertex[u], int_to_vertex[v])) for u, v in edges}
            cycle_basis.append(list(set().union(*new_cycle)))
            # updating orth_set so that i+1, i+2, ...th elements are orthogonal
            # to the newly found cycle
            base = orth_set[i]
            for j in range(i + 1, len(orth_set)):
                if len(**orth_set[j] & new_cycle**) % 2:
                    orth_set[j] = orth_set[j] ^ base
```

In new_cycle we have original vertices so we can't convert vertex to int in orth_set before as they have to be bitwise and with new_cycle as indicated above.

New branch with an implementation using boost. The main advantage is to avoid conversion between sage graph and boost graph as we create directly the boost graph.

Please try it, test it, etc. to check if it's working correctly and also if it is better than previous version.

I added some examples with networkx plus a few corrections.

In `min_cycle_basis`, can we avoid input parameter `edges_complement` and so compute a spanning tree inside the method. Is it important to have this input parameter ?

Since we now have sage graph inside min_cycle_basis , edges_complement can now be computed inside our method , no need to pass it as a parameter.
I will do the required change.

I just tried the the patch with Python3 and we have some issues to fix. This is mostly ordering issues as for instance the order of the keys of a dictionary is not always the same in Python 2 and Python 3.

For instance, I get:

```
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 4679, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.minimum_cycle_basis
Failed example:
    g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=True)
Expected:
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
Got:
    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py", line 4681, in sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.minimum_cycle_basis
Failed example:
    g.minimum_cycle_basis(by_weight=False)
Expected:
    [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]
Got:
    [[1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3], [5, 6, 7]]
```


So, I suggest to use `sorted(g.minimum_cycle_basis(...))` in all examples, and possibly
`sorted(sorted(c) for c in g.minimum_cycle_basis(...))`. This last one might be too much, but...
