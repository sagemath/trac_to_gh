There are some strange formattings IMHO. For example

```
        if not self.is_subvariety_of_ambient_jacobian(
        ) or not other.is_subvariety_of_ambient_jacobian():
```
and

```
        elif isinstance(
                other,
                ModularAbelianVariety_abstract) and other.is_subvariety(self):
```
and

```
            decomp = [
                AbelianVariety(f) for f in self.newform_decomposition('a')
            ]
```
I'm not convinced that all of these are improvements.
