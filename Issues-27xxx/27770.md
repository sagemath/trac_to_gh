There are some strange formattings IMHO. For example

```
        if not self.is_subvariety_of_ambient_jacobian(
        ) or not other.is_subvariety_of_ambient_jacobian():
```
and

```

                AbelianVariety(f) for f in self.newform_decomposition('a')
            ]

I'm not convinced that all of these are improvements.
