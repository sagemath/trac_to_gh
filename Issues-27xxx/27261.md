The following two examples leak memory (in sagemath from 8.9 to 9.3.rc5)

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', 50)
sage: d = {str(g): g for g in R.gens()}
sage: p = sum(d.values())
sage: import gc
sage: mem0 = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(20):
....:     for _ in range(50):
....:         _ = p.subs(**d)
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     mem1 = get_memory_usage()
....:     if mem1 > mem0:
....:         print(i, mem1-mem0)
....:         mem0 = mem1
```
and

```
sage: R.<x, y> = ZZ[]
sage: p = (x + y)**100
sage: mem0 = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(20):
....:     _ = p(x + y, y)
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     mem1 = get_memory_usage()
....:     if mem1 > mem0:
....:         print(i, mem1-mem0)
```

This was reported [on sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/iO1SzoW0kcw) and [ask.sagemath.org](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/29444/high-memory-usage-when-substituting-variables/).

We fix `.subs` (the first example above) by modifying the appropriate singular call. We identified two possibly related memory leaks in singular
- [singular issue #1089](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/issues/1089)
- [singular issue #1090](https://github.com/Singular/Singular/issues/1090)

In the mean time, we use the non-satisfactory solution of going via naive substitution in Python. To do so, we moved the generic implementation on the base class `MPolynomial`.

See also #13447 also related to memory handling in singular.

<a id='comment:1'></a>For testing, I changed the code so that the `id()` of any newly created `MPolynomial_libsingular` instance is stored in some set, and is removed from the set as soon as it becomes garbage collected.

Result: In the above examples, the `MPolynomial_libsingular` instances are correctly garbage collected.

Conclusion: The memleak occurs in Sage's usage of libsingular. Apparently the underlying data of a polynomial are not correctly freed when it is deallocated.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Or, another possibility: Some temporary libsingular data created during the computation of Q is not freed.

To detect this, I will try to make the example more fine-grained: Test if the leak occurs if the only arithmetic operation involved is `_add_`, `_mul_` or `__pow__`, respectively. `(X+Y)<sup>120*Y</sup>100` mixes these three operations.

<a id='comment:3'></a>Interestingly, creating a copy of P from scratch does *not* leak:

```
sage: import gc
sage: R.<X,Y> = ZZ[]
sage: P = (X+Y)^120*Y^100
sage: mem0 = get_memory_usage()
sage: for i in range(500):
....:     Q = (X+Y)^120*Y^100
....:     del Q
....:     _ = gc.collect()
....:     mem1 = get_memory_usage()
....:     if mem1>mem0:
....:         print(i, mem1-mem0)
....:         mem0 = mem1
....:         
(0, 0.1484375)
sage: 
```
So, it seems that calling the polynomial (i.e., `P(X,Y)`) is what is leaking!

What does this have to do with the problem? The `gc.collect()` can be removed from the snippets. They are here to guarantee that there is no undeleted temporary Python objects lying around and get consistent tests. You can crash sage with

```
sage: R = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 'x', 50)
sage: d = {str(g): g for g in R.gens()}
sage: p = sum(d.values())
sage: while True:
....:     _ = p.subs(**d)

<a id='comment:32'></a>How does one convince the upstream? 
Would writing a C++ program using libsingular suffice?
Or a Singular example would be required?
It could be that Singular does not use this function the way it's used here.
In fact, in Singular it's only called at one place, once, in in `maMapIdeal()`
And the latter is only called once:

```
./Singular/ipshell.cc:  v->data=maMapIdeal(IDIDEAL(w), src_ring, (ideal)theMap, currRing,nMap);
```
in Singular's  shell, so it's probably not too hard to figure out the Singular command calling it.

<a id='comment:34'></a>Singular's `subst()` leaks memory very fast, I don't know why we expect anything better from `libsingular`.
E.g.

```
ring r=0,(x,y),dp;
poly p=(x+y)^10;
while (1) {
subst(p,x,x+y);

takes 30 sec to reach many gigabytes.

It would be nice to track the underlying singular issue. However, this should not hold the ticket any longer.

```
ring r;
