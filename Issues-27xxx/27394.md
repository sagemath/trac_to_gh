CC:  @embray @vbraun @jhpalmieri

this is a followup to #26899, where a stop-gap was implemented to let Sage build on a `/usr/include`-less OSX.

It turns out it is pretty easy to provide such a fix.

One also has to do something to pillow:

```
The headers or library files could not be found for zlib,
a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.

I haven't noticed any action on this upstream, but I (or Dima) should make a PR for his patch.  I think it's quite good and has a chance of being accepted; or at the very least making a PR might help spur action upstream.

In the meantime I don't think we should wait.  This is a problem for us *now*, and I have no problem with patching build system stuff.
