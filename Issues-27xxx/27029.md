This breaks stuff in root systems:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/root_system/extended_affine_weyl_group.py  # 404 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/root_system/cartan_type.py  # 6 doctests failed

sage -t --long src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/lie/affine.rst  # 1 doctest failed
```
It looks like it has to do with computing the orbit of `0` in the Dynkin diagram (think special edge-labeled directed graphs) and the `DynkinDiagram.relabel` method must take one parameter.
