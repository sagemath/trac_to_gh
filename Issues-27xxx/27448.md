With #17215, one can do:

```
sage: s = polytopes.simplex(2)
sage: for facet in s.facets():
....:     print("{} has normal vector {}".format(facet,facet.normal_cone().rays()[0].vector()))
....:

A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices has normal vector (-1, 0, 0)
```

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[(0,0), (1,0), (sqrt(AA(2)),2), (1,1)],base_ring=AA)
sage: for facet in P.facets():
....:     print("{} has normal vector {}".format(facet,facet.normal_cone().rays()[0].vector()))
....:     
A 1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in AA^2 defined as the convex hull of 2 vertices has normal vector (0, -1/2)

```

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0, 1, 1, 1, 1)])
sage: for facet in P.facets():

....:

....:     
A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^4 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex and 3 lines has normal vector (1, 1, 1, 1)
```

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(ieqs=[(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, -1)])

```

I don't know if this fulfills what is intended in this ticket? Does it? If it does, I believe that it would be appropriate to minimize the duplication of code. In particular, it seems that the present function is intended for facets only (smaller dimensional faces also have normal vectors, but not anymore just in 1 direction...) so the name `normal_vector` is a choice which may be nasty for the user.

As for speed, well, it is true that we create a polyhedron in `normal_cone`, though, the code in #17215 is essentially all obtained through already computed data. I guess this should be benchmarked.

This might be the case. Can we make the doctests here on this ticket work with the code of #17215 (or giving at least somehow a similar output)?

Yes, true.

It seems that the new code is more general indeed.

Then, I believe it make sense to have a method for facets that return the appropriate normal vector.
