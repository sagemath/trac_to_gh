I don't know if this fulfills what is intended in this ticket? Does it? If it does, I believe that it would be appropriate to minimize the duplication of code. In particular, it seems that the present function is intended for facets only (smaller dimensional faces also have normal vectors, but not anymore just in 1 direction...) so the name `normal_vector` is a choice which may be nasty for the user.

As for speed, well, it is true that we create a polyhedron in `normal_cone`, though, the code in #17215 is essentially all obtained through already computed data. I guess this should be benchmarked.

Yes, true.

It seems that the new code is more general indeed.

Yes, that's definitely possible I would say.

Then, I believe it make sense to have a method for facets that return the appropriate normal vector.
