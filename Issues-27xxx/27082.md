<a id='comment:5'></a>A while-we-are-at-it thing, to improve the speed a bit: I would change

```python
    r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
    if weight is None or r.weight() == _Partitions(weight):
        yield r
    while st_next(st):

to

```python
    if weight is None:
        yield skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)
        while st_next(st):
        r = skewtab_to_SkewTableau(st)

LGTM otherwise.
