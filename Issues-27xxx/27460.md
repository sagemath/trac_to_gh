<a id='comment:4'></a>I added a doctest but it's not good. It works on my laptop with py3, but not with py2.
The order of the keys of the dictionaries is not the same in py2 and py3 :(

with py2, I get

```
..."links": [{"strength": 0, "target": 0, "color": "#aaa", "curve": 0, "source": 1, "name": ""}], "pos": [], "edge_thickness": 4, "loops": [], "edge_labels": false, "vertex_size": 7, "vertex_labels": true, "directed": true, "gravity": 0.04, "charge": -120, "nodes": [{"group": "0", "name": "10"}, {"group": "0", "name": "1"}]...
```
and with py3

```
..."nodes": [{"name": "10", ...}, {"name": "1", ...}], "links": [{"source": 1, "target": 0, ...}]...
```

Any suggestion is more than welcome.
