What happened in this bug report is that CXX has been set to "g++ -std=gnu++11" (where g++ is the system's clang compiler).
This causes an error.

OK, this also needs adjustement w.r.t. to #27212. (Somehow lidia went under the radar there).

What is the correct way to configure it if GMP is installed in the standard location,
searched by default by compiler/linker? Does it still need these `--with-extra...`?

Otherwise, `spkg-install` should contain something like

```sh
sdh_configure --with-arithmetic=gmp \
              --with-extra-includes="$SAGE_GMP_INCLUDE" \
              --with-extra-libs="$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX/lib" \
              --enable-shared=yes --enable-static=no
``` 

---

ok, so an experiment tells me that `--with-extra-` may be skipped if the GMP location is searched by compiler/linker.
