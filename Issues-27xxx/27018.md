As [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/44619/free-nilpotent-lie-algebra-of-step-3-with-11-generators/), this works:

```
LieAlgebra(QQ, 10, step=3, names='X', naming='linear')
```
and this works:

```
LieAlgebra(QQ, 11, step=2, names='X', naming='linear')
```
but this doesn't work:

```
LieAlgebra(QQ, 11, step=3, names='X', naming='linear')
```
The traceback is as follows:

Staring at the construction through the debugger, I can recreate the problem more precisely with the following:

```
sage: L = LieAlgebra(QQ, ['F%d' % k for k in range(11)]).Lyndon()
sage: L[L.graded_basis(1)[0],L.graded_basis(2)[26]]
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'sage.algebras.lie_algebras.lie_algebra_element.Lie' object has no attribute '_right'
```
The problem seems like it may arise from a mismatch between what the graded basis outputs vs. what the free Lie algebra expects it elements to be like.

```
sage: L.graded_basis(1)[0]
F0
sage: X=L.graded_basis(2)[26]; X
[F2, F10]
sage: Y=L[L.graded_basis(1)[2],L.graded_basis(1)[10]]; Y
-[F10, F2]
sage: X==Y
False
```
I will try to figure out more.

That is very helpful. So I was thinking it was because `F10` is not sorted by the integer `10` but by the string `'10'`. Thus, we have

```
sage: sorted(L.graded_basis(1))
[F0, F1, F10, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9]
```
So this is an issue that I was hoping we did not have to address. In other words, the computation does not depend on the generators, i.e., these would do the same computations:

```
sage: Lxyz = LieAlgebra(QQ, ['x','y','z']).Lyndon()
sage: Lzxy = LieAlgebra(QQ, ['z','x','y']).Lyndon()
sage: Lxyz.graded_basis(2)
([x, y], [x, z], [y, z])
sage: Lzxy.graded_basis(2)
([z, x], [z, y], [x, y])
sage: x,y,z = Lxyz.gens()
sage: a,b,c = Lzxy.gens()
sage: a,b,c
(z, x, y)
sage: b.bracket(a)
[x, z]
sage: x.bracket(z)
[x, z]
sage: Lzxy._is_basis_element(b.leading_support(),a.leading_support())
True
sage: Lzxy._is_basis_element(a.leading_support(),b.leading_support())
False
```
So what we have to do is during the comparison of the Lie bracketing (most likely in `_bracket_` and maybe `_rewrite_bracket`) is look up the index within the generators. Actually, a little more invasive but will likely make the code more maintainable is have the `LieGenerator` just keep track of the index of the generator and then have the `monomial_coefficients()` do the translation to the `index_set`.

I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean by this. Namely, I don't understand at which point `monomial_coefficients()` comes into play, since `FreeLieAlgebra.Lyndon._is_basis_element` only uses the word representation of the elements. 

I started modifying the ordering behavior but ran into some problems.
I added an `_index` attribute to `LieGenerator` in the commits and changed `LieGenerator.__richcmp__` to order by indices instead of name. I did not change comparisons in `LyndonBracket.__richcmp__` or `_is_basis_element` yet, as I am not in fact sure what should be the desired behavior. Hence the current commit is still very much broken (a lot of tests fail) due to inconsistent ordering behavior.

What should be the desired behavior?
Was the idea that `Lxyz` and `Lzxy` should or should not behave the same?

If they should behave differently, then should all the word-based comparisons all be changed to use the index-based comparisons?

If they should behave the same, then is it the case that only `graded_basis` has incorrect behavior?

Not knowing how to fix the underlying issue at the moment, I wrote up a bandaid fix for the part that concerns the free nilpotent Lie algebras, since the traceback caused by simply inputting the wrong numbers into a constructor is not very helpful. 

I opened a new ticket #27069 to address the underlying issue.

The motivation for the bandaid fix was mainly that the free Lie algebra computations are only used as an auxiliary tool in the initialization of the `FreeNilpotentLieAlgebra` object.
Since it was not clear to me what is the desired behavior in the free Lie algebra setting, it could be argued that this bug is caused by incorrect usage of the `FreeLieAlgebra` structure inside `FreeNilpotentLieAlgebra.__init__`.

This is why I considered splitting the underlying issue from this ticket, in order to at least avoid the confusing traceback caused by a call of a simple constructor `LieAlgebra(QQ, 11, step=3)` while the underlying issue is being figured out.
