This ticket enhances the function field code to add a construction functor and support the `construction` method:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: K.construction()
(FunctionField
 Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field)

sage: from sage.rings.function_field.function_field import FunctionFieldFunctor
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: FunctionFieldFunctor()(Frac(R))
Rational function field in x over Rational Field
```

**Keywords:** function field

I'm not sure where `FunctionFieldFunctor` should go.  Right now, it's in `function_field.py` in the `src/sage/rings/function_field` directory.

Perhaps we should add a new file in that directory called `functors.py`?  There's going to be at least one more `ConstructionFunctor` in the function field code, for constructing spaces of differentials.

I don't know if it's any better this way.

Well, the coercions I wanted it to discover, it couldn't, so I ended up coding them by hand (Trac #26993).  I created this ticket because I didn't want to just throw this code away, but I don't know if it does anything useful.
