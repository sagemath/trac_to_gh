* What was not clear in the patchbot pyflakes message ? Maybe you looked at the wrong one.. The correct one said

```
src/sage/geometry/hyperplane_arrangement/arrangement.py:1589: local variable 'n' is assigned to but never used
```

* typo "simplical" is still there

* in "is_simplicial", you do not need n when doing essentialization, only after

* then you can just use `all(R.n_facets() == n for R in self.regions())`

* `B = None` should be `B=None` in the def line of poset_of_regions

* next line, Returns should be Return

* The explanation paragraphs (in both functions) are not written in very good English.

* move the import of Poset to the import section near the beginning of the file

* poset_of_regions lacks an INPUT section, and examples using the parameters

* while len(R) can be replaced by while R

I had assumed that all the pyflakes logs would be the same, but apparently not. Going back I was able to find the log you are talking about.

I've gone through and updated the document with the corrections you wanted, with some additional things that I noticed in the correction process.

Yes, there is a rogue patchbot, with no owner and spitting out wrong pyflakes reports...

I would suggest to remove the full sentence

```
In an essential arrangement, this equates to
+        a region having a rank number of facets/bounding hyperplanes.
```
which is not needed, and still a bit clunky.

I've gone ahead and removed the sentence you wanted.
