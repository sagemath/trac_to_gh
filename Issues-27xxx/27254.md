```
In particular to properly handle "dummy" targets like gmp/mpir,
`sagelib` should depend upon `$(inst_$(MP_LIBRARY))`.

Also, `sagelib` in `deps` should only depend on one Python:

```diff
-               $(inst_python2) \
-               $(inst_python3) \
+               $(inst_$(PYTHON)) \
```
