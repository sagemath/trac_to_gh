running `sage -t` in a Python 2 or Python 3 installation of Sage results in a seemingly wrong set of `--optional` flags

```
$ sage -t XXX
...
Using --optional=dochtml,memlimit,mpir,python2,sage

```
In a Python 2 installation the `py2` should be there (and the `python2` appearing because of a is quite weird). While on Python 3 it should be `py3`.

```
return ",".join(sorted(tags - auto_optional_tags))
```
- the `python2` appears in the list because `python2` is an optional package (is it installed under any circumstances?)

Both look quite artificial to me.

Conclusion: doctests are not broken - behavior is very confusing.
