<a id='comment:2'></a>I don't have the Python3 version to test, but I do not think this change is necessary from looking at the code:

```diff
-            sage: p.add_col(range(5), range(5))
+            sage: p.add_col(list(range(5)), list(range(5)))
```
Even if it does fail, I think it would be better to have the original input work.
Otherwise LGTM.
