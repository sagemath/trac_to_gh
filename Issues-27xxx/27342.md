<a id='comment:2'>**Comment 2:**</a>
I don't have the Python3 version to test, but I do not think this change is necessary from looking at the code:

```diff
-            sage: p.add_col(range(5), range(5))
+            sage: p.add_col(list(range(5)), list(range(5)))
```
Even if it does fail, I think it would be better to have the original input work.
Otherwise LGTM.

Thanks for the review. The type "list" is hardcoded (in the cdef line) for both entries of this function. This could be enhanced, but not now.
