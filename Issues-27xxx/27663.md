The indentation in `constructions/contributions.rst` isn't correct as it stands. If you want it to be formatted like `tutorial/afterword.rst`, then you could do this:

```diff

```
Otherwise, I think you should revert the indentation changes in that file.

I would suggest building the old way (reverting the indentation) and also with the added double colons and see which you like better. I have a slight preference for it not to be an indented code block, because then the links are not live, but I don't care very much.
