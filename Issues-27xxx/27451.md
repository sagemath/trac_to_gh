<a id='comment:5'></a>That is quite an improvement.

I have one recommendation, you should replace

```diff
-p.sum(c*elt for c,elt in foo)
+p.linear_combination((elt, c) for c,elt in foo)
```
as the latter has less transient elements because it does not compute the scalar multiplication on each element. At least, I expect some additional speedup by doing that.

Some nitpicks:

Add back in this period:

```diff
-        The coercions are set up between the ``other_basis``.
+        The coercions are set up between the ``other_basis``
```

I think this would make it a little easier to read the (non-compiled) doc:

```diff
-            \sum_{j=0}^r (-1)^{r-j}k^j\binom{r,j} \left(
-            \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d|k} \mu(d/k) p_d \right)_k.
+            \sum_{j=0}^r (-1)^{r-j}k^j\binom{r,j}
+            \left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d|k} \mu(d/k) p_d \right)_k.
```
Feel free to ignore this.

Missing comma:

```diff
-For a partition `\gamma = (1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2}, \ldots r^{m_r})`,
+For a partition `\gamma = (1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2}, \ldots, r^{m_r})`,
```

I don't know how mathjax handles the nonbreaking space `\right)_k~.`. You are also not doing it consistently between `_b_bar_power_k_r` and `_b_bar_power_gamma`.

I believe this looks better in the doc:

```diff
-\sum_{\gamma} \left< h_\lambda, p_\gamma \right>
+\sum_{\gamma} \left\langle h_\lambda, p_\gamma \right\rangle
```
