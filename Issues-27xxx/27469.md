I wanted to know whether -7 was a relative norm from Q(zeta_24) to Q(zeta(8), which it is:

```
sage: L.<z24> = CyclotomicField(24)
sage: K.<z8> = L.subfield(z24^3)[0]
sage: K.is_isomorphic(CyclotomicField(8))
True
sage: K(-7).is_norm(L)
...
IndexError: the number of names must equal the number of generators
```

The error comes from the step where (since L is an absolute field, not a relative one) the code does

```
Lrel = L.relativize(K.hom(L), (L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0') )
```
which calls `normalize_names(1,(L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0'))` which raises the error, since the first parameter should be 2 (or -1).

A workaround is

```
sage: K(-7).is_norm(L.relativize(K.embeddings(L)[0],'c'), element=True)
(True,
 (149/343*z8^3 + 32260/2401*z8^2 + 100/2401*z8 + 39260/2401)*c - 8660/2401*z8^3 - 87/343*z8^2 - 50420/2401*z8 + 844/2401)

I have fixed the bug and added 2 doctests.

The new doctest for is_norm() hides one strange thing.  The line `c in L` gives True as expected.  Running this from the command line, the line `c.parent() is L` also gives True, and is the test I would have liked to include.  But when run as a doctest, that returns False and c.parent() displays the field K, not L.  I am completely mystified as to how that can be happening.  Perhaps something to do with number fields being stores as unique representations.

There's a trivial doctest output change needed after some previous change:

```
File "src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx", line 1631, in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement.is_norm
Failed example:
    K = L.subfield(z24^3, 'z8')[0]; K
Expected:
    Number Field in z8 with defining polynomial x^4 + 1
Got:
    Number Field in z8 with defining polynomial x^4 + 1 with z8 = 0.7071067811865475? + 0.7071067811865475?*I
```
