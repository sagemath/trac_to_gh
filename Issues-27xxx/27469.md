I wanted to know whether -7 was a relative norm from Q(zeta_24) to Q(zeta(8), which it is:

```
sage: L.<z24> = CyclotomicField(24)
sage: K.<z8> = L.subfield(z24^3)[0]
sage: K.is_isomorphic(CyclotomicField(8))
True
sage: K(-7).is_norm(L)
...
IndexError: the number of names must equal the number of generators
```

The error comes from the step where (since L is an absolute field, not a relative one) the code does

```
Lrel = L.relativize(K.hom(L), (L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0') )
```
which calls `normalize_names(1,(L.variable_name()+'0', K.variable_name()+'0'))` which raises the error, since the first parameter should be 2 (or -1).

**Keywords:** norms relative number fields

(True,

I have fixed the bug and added 2 doctests.

The new doctest for is_norm() hides one strange thing.  The line `c in L` gives True as expected.  Running this from the command line, the line `c.parent() is L` also gives True, and is the test I would have liked to include.  But when run as a doctest, that returns False and c.parent() displays the field K, not L.  I am completely mystified as to how that can be happening.  Perhaps something to do with number fields being stores as unique representations.

There's a trivial doctest output change needed after some previous change:

```
File "src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx", line 1631, in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_element.NumberFieldElement.is_norm
Failed example:
