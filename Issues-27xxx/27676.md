gcc-9}}} is due out in late April/early May 2019. With the current {{{gcc-9}}} snapshot, {{{sage}}} has issues where it miscompiles.

There seem to be two sets of issues:

1. {{{openblas-0.3.5}}} doesn't compile correctly with {{{gcc-9}}}. This makes lots of errors occur if {{{SAGE_CHECK="yes"}}} (in {{{openblas}}} and other packages that depend on it) and makes {{{make testlong}}} output lots of errors and eventually just hang. As of writing (2019/04/16), this seems to be fixed in upstream git.

2. Something seems to go wrong with {{{brial}}} or something related. {{{make testlong}}} has errors on the following files:
{{{
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to abort
}}}

As a minor issue, with {{{SAGE_CHECK="yes"}}}, {{{make}}} doesn't seem to stop after compiling {{{openblas}}}, despite many tests failing.

With `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'`, as seen in the logs, all bets are off.

I tried gcc 9.1 (from Gentoo) and got a lot of "Bad exit" in tests from memory overflows.

That's less than I have in sage-on-gentoo but I haven't rebuilt everything yet. But there is really a track leading to pbori not sure if it is just the sage interface or brial itself. brial passes its own testsuite with gcc-9.1 that's already something but not necessarilly conclusive that it is all on sage-side.

Perhaps I misunderstand but my s-o-g `brial` build uses `-O0`; in fact, the system is built that way. And the tests still fail.

Reading more into this, C++11 Standard 5.7.5 says that pointer arithmetic on a pointer that is not pointing into an element of an array is undefined behavior. So in particular the compiler is free to assume that `--ptr` cannot be NULL, since you can't have allocated an array that starts at 0x1. 

The offending code is 

```
/// Release current pointer by decrementing reference counting
inline void 
intrusive_ptr_release(PBORI_PREFIX(DdManager)* ptr) {
   if (!(--(ptr->hooks))) {
 
    PBORI_ASSERT(PBORI_PREFIX(Cudd_CheckZeroRef)(ptr) == 0);
    PBORI_PREFIX(Cudd_Quit)(ptr);
  }
}
```
Really we should just change `DdManager.hooks` to be an `std::size_t` instead of `char*`, why on earth are you using pointer arithmetic to count in the first place. I think thats going to be a simple change since its only used in one or two places.

These are inlined headers so you also need to rebuild the sage library....
