`gcc-9` is due out in late April/early May 2019. With the current `gcc-9` snapshot, `sage` has issues where it miscompiles.

There seem to be two sets of issues:

1. `openblas-0.3.5` doesn't compile correctly with `gcc-9`. This makes lots of errors occur if `SAGE_CHECK="yes"` (in `openblas` and other packages that depend on it) and makes `make testlong` output lots of errors and eventually just hang. As of writing (2019/04/16), this seems to be fixed in upstream git.

2. Something seems to go wrong with `brial` or something related. `make testlong` has errors on the following files:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/crypto/mq/sr.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_sequence.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long --warn-long 31.0 src/sage/rings/polynomial/pbori.pyx  # Killed due to abort
```

As a minor issue, with `SAGE_CHECK="yes"`, `make` doesn't seem to stop after compiling `openblas`, despite many tests failing.

Latest `gcc-9` snapshot as of writing: ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/9-20190414/gcc-9-20190414.tar.xz

Current `openblas` upstream as of writing: https://community.dur.ac.uk/konrad.dabrowski/sage/openblas-0.3.5b.tar.gz

That's less than I have in sage-on-gentoo but I haven't rebuilt everything yet. But there is really a track leading to pbori not sure if it is just the sage interface or brial itself. brial passes its own testsuite with gcc-9.1 that's already something but not necessarilly conclusive that it is all on sage-side.

I don't think they imply this is invalid C. But this is fairly rare occurrence and, if I am reading correctly, accounting for it everywhere means some optimisation opportunities are lost. As you'll note, Volker said the example works at `-O0`. This is from GNU gcc devs from whom I learned that pessimized  was a word (at least they use it).

I should be able to do a micro release of brial to include that option this week. PR welcome if you feel faster. I may also check if I can safely update the `cudd` code in brial to a more recent version. It may be that newer `cudd` doesn't exhibit the problem. 

`@`Volker in which brial file does the incriminated code occur?

Reading more into this, C++11 Standard 5.7.5 says that pointer arithmetic on a pointer that is not pointing into an element of an array is undefined behavior. So in particular the compiler is free to assume that `--ptr` cannot be NULL, since you can't have allocated an array that starts at 0x1. 

The offending code is 

```
/// Release current pointer by decrementing reference counting
inline void 
intrusive_ptr_release(PBORI_PREFIX(DdManager)* ptr) {
   if (!(--(ptr->hooks))) {
 
    PBORI_ASSERT(PBORI_PREFIX(Cudd_CheckZeroRef)(ptr) == 0);
    PBORI_PREFIX(Cudd_Quit)(ptr);
  }
}
```
Really we should just change `DdManager.hooks` to be an `std::size_t` instead of `char*`, why on earth are you using pointer arithmetic to count in the first place. I think thats going to be a simple change since its only used in one or two places.

These are inlined headers so you also need to rebuild the sage library....
