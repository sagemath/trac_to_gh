<a id='comment:14'></a>Hi, I know that this ticket is closed, by I thought it makes sense to mention this here anyways:

I just installed polymake through sage on my office computer and it was not working unless the experimental package `perl_term_readline_gnu` was installed.

Now, this is without the present ticket, but perhaps my question is still relevant: shouldn't `perl_term_readline_gnu` be a dependancy of polymake?
