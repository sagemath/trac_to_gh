this is a slightly non-standard perl module we happen to have an spkg for, used in polymake interface.

On Debian this module is  in `libterm-readline-gnu-perl`.

I agree, but `bootstrap`, of course, gets run automatically by `make install`. At least in my test I verified that it was run and that your configuration script detected a non-GNU Term::Readline.

I would be inclined to set it to positive review, but it could perhaps use another round of testing on a Linux system.

I just tried on stable Debian, and without debian package `libterm-readline-gnu-perl`
the spkg is marked as to be installed, whereas if I install `libterm-readline-gnu-perl`
then it is marked as not to be installed.

Hi, I know that this ticket is closed, by I thought it makes sense to mention this here anyways:

I just installed polymake through sage on my office computer and it was not working unless the experimental package `perl_term_readline_gnu` was installed.

Now, this is without the present ticket, but perhaps my question is still relevant: shouldn't `perl_term_readline_gnu` be a dependancy of polymake?
