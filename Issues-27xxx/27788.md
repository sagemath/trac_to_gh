Let us make Sage reals and rationals more friendly
to formatting commands that expect Python floats.

For example, with a Python float one can do

```
sage: a = 1.25r
sage: "{:0.3f}".format(a)
'1.250'
```
but a similar command fails for a Sage real or rational:

```
sage: a = 1.25
sage: "{:0.3f}".format(a)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to
sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealLiteral.__format__
```

```
sage: a = 5/4
sage: "{:0.3f}".format(a)
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to
sage.rings.rational.Rational.__format__
```

This puzzles users especially when using Python packages with Sage.
As things stand one needs to know to work around Sage's preparser.

For example this came up in

- [Ask Sage question 46408: tqdm's "total" parameter bug](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/46408)
- [Ask Sage question 52617: f string float not working](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52617)

The case of Sage integers was dealt with in #12788 and can provide inspiration.

We could also consider doing the same for number field elements, algebraic numbers,
complex floating-point numbers, continued fractions... and other numbers in Sage
for which it makes sense.

This is part of #29728 (Meta-ticket: improve compatibility with the Python library).

This should be easily resolved by implementing `__format__` on the relevant types.  This might be a good beginner project.

#30515 now has an implementation for real and complex numbers.

Implementing this for rational numbers is a bit tricky since they have arbitrary precision, so fully parsing the [format specificier](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) seems to be necessary. Once the precision is known, one could convert to a `RealField` of suitable precision and reuse the `__format__` of its elements, but there may be some corner cases.
