Before:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x.subs(x=a)
The slowest run took 10.21 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 74.1 µs per loop
```
After:

```
The slowest run took 164.38 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.6 µs per loop

Indeed, thanks!

I think it does make sense to cache it at the highest level. It should be small in memory (at least, I would be shocked if anyone created something with 10000 generators and not expecting to need a lot of memory), and this way all things that use it can benefit.

There is one problem (that I should have noticed earlier and was a problem even with your original proposal): a `dict` is mutable. So you can really destroy things by mutating the output of `gens_dict`. A `Family` is like an immutable `dict`, but its iteration is over values, not keys.
