Oooops—thank you, and sorry for the stupid mistake! Here's a new attempt. I used `@cached_method`, not `@lazy_attribute`, because lazy attributes are computed as soon as you try to access them, and there are parents for which `gens()` returns infinitely many generators, so that the default `gens_dict()` loops.
