Before:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = ZZ[]
sage: a = GF(3)(2)
sage: %timeit x.subs(x=a)
The slowest run took 10.21 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 74.1 µs per loop
```
After:

```
The slowest run took 164.38 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 13.6 µs per loop
```

Indeed, thanks!

I think it does make sense to cache it at the highest level. It should be small in memory (at least, I would be shocked if anyone created something with 10000 generators and not expecting to need a lot of memory), and this way all things that use it can benefit.
