When generating the documentation with Sage 8.7.rc0 -- Python3, one gets the following deprecation warnings:

```
[dochtml] [repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[dochtml] [repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
[dochtml] [functions] <unknown>:234: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[dochtml] [functions] <unknown>:349: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[dochtml] [cryptogra] <unknown>:505: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \G
[dochtml] [misc     ] <unknown>:1496: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \|
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:391: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \o
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:549: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \O
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:580: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \O
[dochtml] [interface] <unknown>:1496: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \|
```
Except for the first two (those in `repl`), they are due to function docstrings that are opened with `"""` while they should be opened with `r"""` since they contain LaTeX backslashes. The branch in this ticket fixes this. The issue in `repl` is due to the file `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py` and seems of different origin.

Good! because it was quite tedious to find the failing docstrings, the error message with `<unknown>` being not particularly helpful...
