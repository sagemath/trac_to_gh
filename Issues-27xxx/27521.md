When generating the documentation with Sage 8.7.rc0 -- Python3, one gets the following deprecation warnings:

```
[dochtml] [repl     ] <unknown>:181: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \)
[dochtml] [repl     ] <unknown>:365: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \w
[dochtml] [functions] <unknown>:234: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[dochtml] [functions] <unknown>:349: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \l
[dochtml] [cryptogra] <unknown>:505: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \G
[dochtml] [misc     ] <unknown>:1496: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \|
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:391: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \o
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:549: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \O
[dochtml] [function_] <unknown>:580: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \O
[dochtml] [interface] <unknown>:1496: DeprecationWarning: invalid escape sequence \|
```
Except for the first two (those in `repl`), they are due to function docstrings that are opened with `"""` while they should be opened with `r"""` since they contain LaTeX backslashes. The branch in this ticket fixes this. The issue in `repl` is due to the file `src/sage/repl/interpreter.py` and seems of different origin.

Note that the pycodestyle plugin is supposed to check exactly for this, but this requires the installation of pycodestyle on the patchbot machines.

Good! because it was quite tedious to find the failing docstrings, the error message with `<unknown>` being not particularly helpful...
