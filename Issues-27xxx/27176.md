We fix doctests in
- `incidence_matrix`: we change the example from `CubeGraph` to `PetersenGraph` as it is stable for `py2` and `py3`. It is possible to fix the order of the rows of the matrix with parameter `vertices`, but the order of the columns depends on `.edge_iterator()` which itself depends on `.vertex_iterator()` which is not always the same in py3 than in py2. An alternative would be to add parameter `edges` to the method to specify the ordering of the columns...

- `eulerian_circuit`: we fix the issue by changing the way the graph. It changes the internal order of vertices and edges and this is sufficient for getting same result in py2 and py3. With original construction, the internal order of vertices was depending on the order of the keys of the input dict (might be different in py2 and py3)

- `min_spanning_tree`: we sort the edges of the solution.
