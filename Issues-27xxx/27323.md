Attempting to use an optional package with pexpect interface which is not installed displays whatever the method `install_hints` provides.  This method was not provided by the FriCAS interface, resulting in a unnecessarily difficult to understand error message.

The particular error using `limit` with `algorithm="fricas"` in the original report has a different reason, which was fixed in #26068.

Old description:

When FriCAS is not present, we get the following error when trying
to compute a limit using FriCAS:

```
sage: limit(cos(x), x=0, algorithm='fricas')
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'l' referenced before assignment
```
The error message should instead say that FriCAS was not found,
and ideally hint at running `sage -i fricas` in the terminal.

Actually, it would make much more sense to have this message on (failed) startup of FriCAS, that is in `interfaces.fricas.FriCAS.__init__` or `interfaces.fricas.FriCAS._start`.

Unfortunately, it is hard to uninstall fricas.

Wouldn't it be even better to do this for all `Expect` interfaces?

Oh, this actually exists and is called `install_hints`.  I will provide a fix shortly.
