`igraph` doesn't build on some systems:

```
[igraph-0.7.1999] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.9.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -lblas
[igraph-0.7.1999] /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/4.9.3/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: cannot find -llapack
```

Ideally, it *should* use OpenBLAS but it doesn't. Note that linking against OpenBLAS should be done with `-lopenblas`, not `-lblas`.

---

The use of blas/lapack in the (new) igraph is optional, so we just not use them in this branch.

We also specify the required in the (new) igraph package glpk in its dependencies.

in fact, it's entirely a bug introduced by me. The have very similar options
--with-glpk=external, --with-blas=external, meaning totally different things---cause they ship a version of glpk, but do not ship one for blas/lapack, which are actually optional.

So we should not link them at all (I won't try making an openblas version, I have no idea whether it's supported).

What about GLPK? If you want to use the GLPK in Sage, there should be a dependency on it.
