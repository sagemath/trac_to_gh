When building Python 2/3 the Python build system attempts to build several extension modules that are part of the stdlib, but does not fail the build if building some of those modules fails, as many of them are optional.

There are some such modules that are mandatory for Sage, so we check after the Python build that they can be imported, and force the build to fail if not:

```
echo "Testing importing of various modules..."
import_errors=false
test_modules="ctypes math hashlib crypt readline socket"
if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
    test_modules="$test_modules _scproxy"
fi

for module in $test_modules; do
    if $PYTHON -c "import $module"; then
        echo "$module module imported OK"
    else
        echo >&2 "$module module failed to import"
        import_errors=true
    fi
done

if $import_errors; then
    echo >&2 "Error: One or more modules failed to import."
    exit 1
fi
```

This came up recently in light of #26899, where the `zlib` module was silently failing to build on some macOS versions.  Hence, we should have also added `zlib` to this list.

It turns out also that elliptic_curves has a build-time dependency on the `sqlite3` module being built properly, so we should add it as well.

Also `ssl` should be added, but we reserve this for a follow-up ticket that addresses the whole openssl mess on macOS.

That's a good idea, I think, because it avoids nasty surprises later when people try to use pip.

No. From earlier in the log file:

Could not build the ssl module!
Python requires an OpenSSL 1.0.2 or 1.1 compatible libssl with X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host().

Sage without a functioning openssl (and thus not fully functioning pip, probably broken jupyter too) is pretty much broken, that is, it's probably more about saving potential users time.

I ventured into this mess on MacOS last year https://bugs.python.org/issue36344
and the "logic" of what's going on with openssl support made me question my own sanity :-)

But perhaps Python 3.8 is an improvement.

IMHO we'd ease the suffering of everyone wanting to build/run Sage on MacOS by telling them to use Conda or Homebrew.

On the same machine, vanilla Sage 9.1.beta1 runs the Jupyter notebook just fine, despite Python's failure to build the `ssl` module. `pip` is indeed broken, but it apparently hasn't bothered me before, so I am at least one user who can survive without a functioning `ssl` Python module.
