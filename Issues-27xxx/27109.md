The problem is it unconditionally appends the output of GCC's `-print-multi-os-directory` flag to the install location, whereas when installing in `$SAGE_LOCAL` we just always want `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

This is already [fixed upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi/commit/877ea9bf9ac2c98cb858c12f5a6aeeec13cf978f#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408a), so we just need to include that patch.

No, it's because there hasn't been a release of libffi since 2014! There is a "libffi 3.3 Release Candidate 0" though: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/releases

Is there potentially something else that is at issue? Sage tries to build `libffi` on my Gentoo box where it fails. I have had `libffi-3.2.1` installed on the Gentoo box for over a year. I do not really need to install `libffi` under Sage. So something did not find my installed `libffi` and tries to install it under Sage. Is a `./configure` necessary? Shouldn't it have been run when typing `make`?

Perhaps we could also add that to the list of build dependencies in the installation instructions.

So even after running `./configure` I see

```
configure: === checking whether to install the libffi SPKG ===
checking for library containing ffi_call... -lffi
checking ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi.h... no
checking ffi/ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi/ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi/ffi.h... no
```
Since the headers are in a `non-standard` location they are not found. This `non-standard` location is where the `libffi` package installs the headers by default.

This appears to do the trick here. Now from `config.log`

 The problem is it unconditionally appends the output of GCC's `-print-multi-os-directory` flag to the install location, whereas when installing in `$SAGE_LOCAL` we just always want `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.
 
-This is already [fixed upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi/commit/877ea9bf9ac2c98cb858c12f5a6aeeec13cf978f#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408a) (quite some time ago in fact) so we just need to include that patch.
