Not that I understand what this example is demonstrating or whether it's important, but I also don't understand why it was removed in service to Python 3 fixes?  Why shouldn't this example work on Python 3?  Or is it an example that is not expected to work at all (or maybe if the example is random it might be better if it were kept but marked `# random`, emphasizing that the result may or may not be false).

I removed it, because with python3 it surprisingly gave `True`, but more importantly, because I think it is not very interesting.  When I implemented all this, I was not sure how to structure the various results returned by findstat.  I now know a little better, and I have plans for a much better interface, but not really the time right now.

If you insist, I can mark the doctest as random.
