The problem is it unconditionally appends the output of GCC's `-print-multi-os-directory` flag to the install location, whereas when installing in `$SAGE_LOCAL` we just always want `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`.

This is already [fixed upstream](https://github.com/libffi/libffi/commit/877ea9bf9ac2c98cb858c12f5a6aeeec13cf978f#diff-67e997bcfdac55191033d57a16d1408a), so we just need to include that patch.

No, it's because there hasn't been a release of libffi since 2014! There is a "libffi 3.3 Release Candidate 0" though: https://github.com/libffi/libffi/releases

Is there potentially something else that is at issue? Sage tries to build `libffi` on my Gentoo box where it fails. I have had `libffi-3.2.1` installed on the Gentoo box for over a year. I do not really need to install `libffi` under Sage. So something did not find my installed `libffi` and tries to install it under Sage. Is a `./configure` necessary? Shouldn't it have been run when typing `make`?

I believe the `configure` step is not correct. In `config.log` on Gentoo

```
configure:9080: g++ -o conftest -g -O2  -I/usr/include -I/usr/include  -Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -L/usr/lib -L/usr/lib conftest.cpp -lffi  -lz -lm  >&5

conftest.cpp:58:10: fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory
 #include <ffi.h>
          ^~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```
So the headers cannot be found even though they are installed, but in sort of an `odd` location.

Just using the patch from upstream seems towork (with the necessary changes applied to `configure` as well).

I'm not sure if we really need to bump the package-version.txt either since the package will have never installed successfully in the first place for anyone affected by this.

So even after running `./configure` I see

```
configure: === checking whether to install the libffi SPKG ===
checking for library containing ffi_call... -lffi
checking ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi.h... no
checking ffi/ffi.h usability... no
checking ffi/ffi.h presence... no
checking for ffi/ffi.h... no
```
Since the headers are in a `non-standard` location they are not found. This `non-standard` location is where the `libffi` package installs the headers by default.

I'm seeing current build failures related to libffi on "OpenSuse Leap 15.0":
