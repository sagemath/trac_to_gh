Keywords: Intrinsics, SIMD

We should compile Sage with the extra compile argument `-march=native` for extra performance, at least if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is not set.

In `gcc/spkg_configure.ac` we check, whether the argument `-march=native` is accepted.

In `build/make/Makefile.in` we assemble the flags.

We add `-march=native` to the compiler flags, if not building fat binaries and the compiler and the package accepts it.

During the build of sage there are now the following flags that can be exported in `spkg_install.in` with one line, instead of checking `SAGE_DEBUG` etc. for each individual package, e.g. by
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above with `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` (flags as above without `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode, add `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3_NON_NATIVE` (`O3` instead of `O2`, no `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)

Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.

We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if absolutely necessary for packages to work.

Inidividual packages can still be compiled with specified flags or in debug mode using

```
make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package
```
or

```
make SAGE_DEBUG="yes" some-package
```

looks OK - not sure whether converting version to `float()` is normal practice, but that's minor.

I'm also not sure whether this will pass the argument to Cython, or it needs

`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -march=native`

in `*.pxd` files.

I believe it works, but I'm not entirely sure.

This seems to state that `sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx` was compiled with `-march=native`.

I have not set it with `CFLAGS`, in that case it would have appeared twice on the list.

This is why I did it in the setup file.\n\n\nI'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.\n\nIdeally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.\n\n(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)",

I'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.

Ideally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.

(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)

Thanks for the comment by the way. It makes sense to me.

I'm just very busy at the moment and didn't have time to see how that could be handled by the configure script.

Thanks. I basically did it like this.

I also added `-O0`, `-O2` and `-g` according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. This helps clean up a lot of code (basically every package sets those flags manually).

Finally, I used `src/bin/testcflags.sh` to remove unsupported flags.

The package `ecm` still adds `-march=native` on top of `CFLAGS` unless a similar flag is present.

Some packages prefer `-O3` over `-O2`, so I left the flag `-O3` as it is.

With this branch all tests passed on my end (ran distclean and installed all packages I touched).

Ok. Took a while, but it seems to work now. The test `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/psage.py` only worked on retry, but I guess this is fine.

What I did was basically the following:

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin
$ make
$ sage -t --long --all
```
(install gcc)

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package | grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin; make; sage -t --long --all
```
(use system gcc)

I'm often having trouble with openssl and I don't exactly understand the problem (but the workaround seems to work), so I guess you can ignore that part.

I would suggest the following for others to test it:

- Pull ticket.
- Unset `CFLAGS` etc.
- `make distclean`
- configure to compile as you would usually do, plus add the following:

```
$ ./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " "
```
  so e.g. one would configure to compile with clang as follows:

```
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ FC=flang ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
```
- make sage
- install optional packages

```
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ") sage_numerical_backends_coin
```
- test everything with `sage -t --all --long`

Report any (unusual) trouble you are having.

Can someone please help me with the following issue.

- conda-forge and homebrew-macos

```
  `/bin/sh: ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh: No such file or directory`
```
  The following line seems to be a problem:

```
+opt := $(shell export CC=$(CC) && ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh $(opt))
```

Otherwise things are looking good, I would say.

Things have improved "by themselves" (of course not):

Now the current ticket (with #29087 merged) runs as smooth as the current beta [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035). However many tests got cancelled due to exceeding 6 hours.

Seems to work now:

Some strange fail in (debian-bullseye, standard):

Looks somewhat like a racing condition to me. Given that it bullseye suceeds on minimal and standard-python2, I would say it's fine.

Is this ticket anywhere near a positive review?

It would be nice to migrate my own implementation for bitsets for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to the one in `data_structures/bitsets.pxi`. That would prevent a lot of code duplication for #29191. But I would only do this, if I can modify `data_structures/bitsets.pxi` such that it uses intrinsics.

But, enabling intrinsics without `-march=native` as default would mean that a lot of code is never really tested as many cases are very dependent on the specific architecture (see #27103).

Perhaps, keeping it a non-default is more meaningful?

Also #29575 (debian-jessie: fflas_ffpack again) is from that run.

So this may need some more work

This appears to be #28800. I'm currently using the original settings for
- pari (to fix this segemtation fault),
- fflas_ffpack,
- gfortran.

I'll push something, once I have more luck.

It seems that my approaches for disabling `-march=native` for certain packages don't work.

For ubuntu-trusty it tried to compile `gfortran` with `-march=native`, but I tried to disable that.

For linuxmint-19, python 2 I'm still getting the segmentation fault when building the documentation. So I'm suspecting that `pari` was build with `-march=native` against my wishes.

Turns out my makefile syntax was completely wrong. But I think I got it figured out now and it should correctly determine the gcc version (and check correctly `SAGE_DEBUG` and `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`).

`@`embray: As you wrote a workaround that fixes segmentation faults when building the documentation in #28356, maybe you have an educated guess, which package might be causing the following problem. Currently I disable `-march=native` for the following:
- pari
- cypari
- pari_jupyter
- fflas_ffpack
- gfortran
- gcc (I'm not sure if `gcc/build_gcc` will do that, it seemed to help the gfortran issue however)
- linbox

New try. Do it in `configure.ac` now, this is where it belongs I think. I will most likely have all the old problems again.

What kind of options should I add for this?

Something like `--disable-sse --disable-sse2 --disable-sse3 --disable-ssse3 --disable-sse41 --disable-sse42 --disable-fma --disable-fma4 --disable-avx --disable-avx2`? However, I'm not sure that this will be used anywhere.

sure, you are setting compilers' flags, and this is done in the files I pointed to.
E.g. in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
    # Modify CXX to include an option that enables C++11 support if necessary
    AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11([], optional)
```
which adds if needed something to `CXXFLAGS`, etc.

AC_PROG_CC only is called early in `configure.ac` to ensure general sanity.
As you might know, `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` are collected by `./boostrap` and used to
generate `./configure` from them and `configure.ac`. We have moved a lot of compiler-specific stuff into  `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` when the latter were instroduced, and for a good reason.

and everything still seemed to be working. This means that we can move all these `AC_PROG_*()`
(perhaps using `AC_REQUIRE()`) to respective `build/pkgs/*/*.m4` files.

If you could try this during the refactoring you're planning to do, it'd be great.

And back to the old problems again.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/140694723

There are sementation faults when building the documentation e.g. in ubuntu bionic.

However, I disabled `march=native` for pari and all packages depending on `pari` and that still didn't seem to fix the issue (according to the logs this seemed to work).

Something isn't thread safe from above probably as in #28800. I have no clue, about that and I'm left with disabling `march=native` for random packages and hoping that I have luck.

Or does anyone know how to get a meaningful log of the documentation build?

OK, this still looks acceptable, w.r.t. what is done in configure.ac, and try further refactoring on another ticket.

I took a brief look at the source changes, and it looks clean to me. 
I haven't looked at the tests.

It really looks like `pari` shouldn't be optimzed. At least not when using `clang`.
https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/787575732?check_suite_focus=true

This old run, didn't have the new doctest failures.

So try disabling `-march=native` for `pari` and maxima`?

As far as I understand, Maxima build process does not involve anything but a Lisp compiler, ECL in the case of Sage. And ECL compiles directly into object files, as far as I know.

So this is probably a red herring.

The last commits don't make a difference as far as I can tell. But the new mac failures seem to be real random. They are also present here (which is a completely different ticket):
- local-macos (homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg, minimal) https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/785733405?check_suite_focus=true

I personally guess the new errors on mac are either random or caused by something else (some package updated maybe). That would also explain why on homebrew-macos-python3_xcode there are so many new failures for standard, but not for minimal. (As this ticket here is supposed to influence minimal much more than standard.)

Something is going on either way, as even on 9.2.beta1 we have many time outs in `plot` and `manifolds`. So if I get an extra error in `sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes.pyx`, I don't even know if this is really bad or just random.

Basically, I see the following options now:

- revert the last two commits or not (independent of the other options):

  I don't see an advantage in disabling `-march=native` for `pari`, but maybe that is really something we should do.
- decide that the macos failures are either random or acceptable
- disable `-march=native` for clang (but it is not said that things would improve for mac then)
- someone has an educated guess about what I could do about the mac failures

It is possible however that some of the new mac failures are caused by the fact that the default `CFLAGS` is now `-g -O2` instead of just empty.

For an updated comparison, I started a mac only test on the current develop again:

This definitely doesn't implement autotools semantics of "precious variables", but I think it is an improvement towards that.

Until now, every build of sage would pick up `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS` and `F77FLAGS` again from the environment. This is strange especially now that we have seperated `make` from `configure`.

With this ticket the flags will be picked up on `configure` (if set) and will overwritten for `make` according to their set up (this is what `sage-build-env-config.in` does). They are also mostly respected now. Until now, if you set `CFLAGS` to `-O0`, every package `spkg-install.in` would just overwrite that (or add `-g -O2`, which in practice overwrites it I think). Now many (but not all) packages will just respect that.

I think it needs very little change to implement autotools semantics of "precious variables" `CFLAGS` etc. from here, but I'm not sure exactly how to do this.

Yes you can still set `SAGE_DEBUG`. However, if you configure with the option `--enable-debug=...`, it will override this variable.

Note also that this must now be done at configuration time.

The problem is that what `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly does is to set `CFLAGS` accordingly. If we configure this stuff in `configure` then it feels like doing everything twice. Unless we ignore `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly in `configure` and wait for this until `sage-build-env-config.in`. There we could do

```
export SAGE_DEBUG?="@SAGE_DEBUG@"
```
and then build together all the flags according to `SAGE_DEBUG`.
