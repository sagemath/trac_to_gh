```
We should compile Sage with the extra compile argument `-march=native` for extra performance, at least if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is not set.

In `gcc/spkg_configure.ac` we check, whether the argument `-march=native` is accepted.

In `build/make/Makefile.in` we assemble the flags.

We add `-march=native` to the compiler flags, if not building fat binaries and the compiler and the package accepts it.

During the build of sage there are now the following flags that can be exported in `spkg_install.in` with one line, instead of checking `SAGE_DEBUG` etc. for each individual package, e.g. by
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above with `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` (flags as above without `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode, add `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3_NON_NATIVE` (`O3` instead of `O2`, no `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)

Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.

We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if absolutely necessary for packages to work.

Inidividual packages can still be compiled with specified flags or in debug mode using

```
make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package
```
or

```
make SAGE_DEBUG="yes" some-package
```

Depends on #30375

-- `f_vector` of `polytopes.permutahedron(8)` takes 1.6 seconds with intrinsics and 4.8 seconds without.

looks OK - not sure whether converting version to `float()` is normal practice, but that's minor.

I'm also not sure whether this will pass the argument to Cython, or it needs

`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -march=native`

in `*.pxd` files.

I believe it works, but I'm not entirely sure.

This seems to state that `sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx` was compiled with `-march=native`.

I have not set it with `CFLAGS`, in that case it would have appeared twice on the list.

This is why I did it in the setup file.\n\nI'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.\n\nIdeally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.\n\n(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)",

I'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.

Ideally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.

(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)

Thanks for the comment by the way. It makes sense to me.

I'm just very busy at the moment and didn't have time to see how that could be handled by the configure script.

Thanks. I basically did it like this.

I also added `-O0`, `-O2` and `-g` according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. This helps clean up a lot of code (basically every package sets those flags manually).

Finally, I used `src/bin/testcflags.sh` to remove unsupported flags.

The package `ecm` still adds `-march=native` on top of `CFLAGS` unless a similar flag is present.

Some packages prefer `-O3` over `-O2`, so I left the flag `-O3` as it is.

With this branch all tests passed on my end (ran distclean and installed all packages I touched).

Ok. Took a while, but it seems to work now. The test `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/psage.py` only worked on retry, but I guess this is fine.

What I did was basically the following:

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin
$ make
$ sage -t --long --all
```
(install gcc)

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package | grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin; make; sage -t --long --all
```
(use system gcc)

I'm often having trouble with openssl and I don't exactly understand the problem (but the workaround seems to work), so I guess you can ignore that part.

I would suggest the following for others to test it:

- Pull ticket.
- Unset `CFLAGS` etc.
- `make distclean`
- configure to compile as you would usually do, plus add the following:

```
$ ./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " "
```
  so e.g. one would configure to compile with clang as follows:

```
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ FC=flang ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
```
- make sage
- install optional packages

```
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ") sage_numerical_backends_coin
```
- test everything with `sage -t --all --long`

Report any (unusual) trouble you are having.

[https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/422709282](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/422709282)

I pulled the newest develop and #29087 to run those tests.

It's really hard to see the difference to your run: [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/422167181](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/422167181). I'm reducing my attention here to those tests that suceeded for you:

- Problems with gsl for
  - ubuntu-xenial, minimal, ubuntu-latest
  - ubuntu-xenial, standard, ubuntu-latest

- Problems with gsl and libatomic_ops for
  - ubuntu-bionic, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - ubuntu-eoan, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - fedora-26, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - fedora-28, standard, ubuntu-latest

- Never ran the following:
  - ubuntu-bionic-i386, standard:

From this I gather that maybe one shouldn't use `-march=native` for those two packages. Does this make any sense?

<a id='comment:33'>Comment 33:</a>
Can someone please help me with the following issue.

- conda-forge and homebrew-macos

```
  `/bin/sh: ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh: No such file or directory`
```
  The following line seems to be a problem:

```
+opt := $(shell export CC=$(CC) && ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh $(opt))
```

Otherwise things are looking good, I would say.

Things have improved "by themselves" (of course not):

Now the current ticket (with #29087 merged) runs as smooth as the current beta [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035). However many tests got cancelled due to exceeding 6 hours.

Lots of the doctest failures that you reported can also be seen on 9.1.beta9 on these platforms. 
Help with fixing them is very welcome.

Seems to work now:

[https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/67557444](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/actions/runs/67557444)

Some strange fail in (debian-bullseye, standard):

```
cp: cannot create directory '/sage/local/./lib/python3.7/site-packages/Cython/__pycache__': File exists
```
Looks somewhat like a racing condition to me. Given that it bullseye suceeds on minimal and standard-python2, I would say it's fine.

Otherwise its the usual suspects (note that macos got cancelled due to timout):

Is this ticket anywhere near a positive review?

It would be nice to migrate my own implementation for bitsets for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to the one in `data_structures/bitsets.pxi`. That would prevent a lot of code duplication for #29191. But I would only do this, if I can modify `data_structures/bitsets.pxi` such that it uses intrinsics.

But, enabling intrinsics without `-march=native` as default would mean that a lot of code is never really tested as many cases are very dependent on the specific architecture (see #27103).

Looks like @vbraun is already merging it for 9.1.

In a test run for `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/617198833) I see a new error building gfortran:

```

```

Also #29575 (debian-jessie: fflas_ffpack again) is from that run.

So this may need some more work

What I'm getting from the failures above is the following:

Don't use `-march=native` as a default for gfortran and and python.

Require gcc at least 5.1 in addition to the checks here (this was my first approach, I don't find the bug anymore that caused me to think we need at least version 5.1, but certainly 4.9.2 isn't working for us).

This appears to be #28800. I'm currently using the original settings for
- pari (to fix this segemtation fault),
- fflas_ffpack,
- gfortran.

I'll push something, once I have more luck.

It seems that my approaches for disabling `-march=native` for certain packages don't work.

For ubuntu-trusty it tried to compile `gfortran` with `-march=native`, but I tried to disable that.

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/622914460?check_suite_focus=true

For linuxmint-19, python 2 I'm still getting the segmentation fault when building the documentation. So I'm suspecting that `pari` was build with `-march=native` against my wishes.

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/622915243?check_suite_focus=true

I can keep on trying, but maybe someone that understands those scripts better than me finds a mistake. I would appreciate that.

Turns out my makefile syntax was completely wrong. But I think I got it figured out now and it should correctly determine the gcc version (and check correctly `SAGE_DEBUG` and `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`).

@embray: As you wrote a workaround that fixes segmentation faults when building the documentation in #28356, maybe you have an educated guess, which package might be causing the following problem. Currently I disable `-march=native` for the following:
- pari
- cypari
- pari_jupyter
- fflas_ffpack
- gfortran
- gcc (I'm not sure if `gcc/build_gcc` will do that, it seemed to help the gfortran issue however)
- linbox

I don't think this is where it belongs. I'm setting flags for building any package.

This is usually done in `configure.ac` and is so already. If you don't set `CFLAGS` then `AC_PROG_CC()` will set `CFLAGS` to `-g -02` (or different order).

sure, you are setting compilers' flags, and this is done in the files I pointed to.
E.g. in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
    # Modify CXX to include an option that enables C++11 support if necessary
    AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11([], optional)
```
which adds if needed something to `CXXFLAGS`, etc.

AC_PROG_CC only is called early in `configure.ac` to ensure general sanity.
As you might know, `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` are collected by `./boostrap` and used to
generate `./configure` from them and `configure.ac`. We have moved a lot of compiler-specific stuff into  `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` when the latter were instroduced, and for a good reason.

What I meant by this was for the top-level configure to have an option `--enable-fat-binary` (or perhaps a better name for that) so that this is not controlled by an environment variable.

It seems that with the new approach things have improved. Or maybe some work has been done somewhere else.

- tox.ini:

  looks the same to me (new failure to push docker image for debian-jessie):

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966983

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808684

- optional:

  no new failure (although tests aren't all the way done yet)

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966981

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808682 

- `gcc_spkg`:

  some tests take half an hour longer, but I don't know if that has any say

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966986

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808677

- cygwin-standard:

  looks the same to me:

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966985

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808676

- cygwin-minimal:

  looks the same to me:

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966984

  https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808673

once again, settings of gcc flags are not to be done in `configure.ac` - as I explained, we already have all of them we currently set, set in `build/pkgs/{gcc,gfortran}/spkg-configure.m4`

Please move them accordingly, or if you have problem doing that, I can help, but doing compiler settings in two different places is verboden.

And back to the old problems again.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/140694723

There are sementation faults when building the documentation e.g. in ubuntu bionic.

However, I disabled `march=native` for pari and all packages depending on `pari` and that still didn't seem to fix the issue (according to the logs this seemed to work).

Something isn't thread safe from above probably as in #28800. I have no clue, about that and I'm left with disabling `march=native` for random packages and hoping that I have luck.

Or does anyone know how to get a meaningful log of the documentation build?

+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above with `-march=native` if possible)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` (flags as above without `-march=native`)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode, add `-march=native` if possible)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3_NON_NATIVE` (`O3` instead of `O2`, no `-march=native`)
+- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)
+
+Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.
+
+We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if absolutely necessary for packages to work.

OK, this still looks acceptable, w.r.t. what is done in configure.ac, and try further refactoring on another ticket.

As far as I understand, Maxima build process does not involve anything but a Lisp compiler, ECL in the case of Sage. And ECL compiles directly into object files, as far as I know.

So this is probably a red herring.

The last commits don't make a difference as far as I can tell. But the new mac failures seem to be real random. They are also present here (which is a completely different ticket):
- local-macos (homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg, minimal) https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/785733405?check_suite_focus=true

I personally guess the new errors on mac are either random or caused by something else (some package updated maybe). That would also explain why on homebrew-macos-python3_xcode there are so many new failures for standard, but not for minimal. (As this ticket here is supposed to influence minimal much more than standard.)

Something is going on either way, as even on 9.2.beta1 we have many time outs in `plot` and `manifolds`. So if I get an extra error in `sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes.pyx`, I don't even know if this is really bad or just random.

Basically, I see the following options now:

- revert the last two commits or not (independent of the other options):

  I don't see an advantage in disabling `-march=native` for `pari`, but maybe that is really something we should do.
- decide that the macos failures are either random or acceptable
- disable `-march=native` for clang (but it is not said that things would improve for mac then)
- someone has an educated guess about what I could do about the mac failures

It is possible however that some of the new mac failures are caused by the fact that the default `CFLAGS` is now `-g -O2` instead of just empty.

For an updated comparison, I started a mac only test on the current develop again:

Yes you can still set `SAGE_DEBUG`. However, if you configure with the option `--enable-debug=...`, it will override this variable.

Note also that this must now be done at configuration time.

I just checked. The following all work:

```
./configure --enable-debug=yes
```

```
./configure SAGE_DEBUG=yes
```

```
export SAGE_DEBUG=yes; ./configure
```

The problem is that what `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly does is to set `CFLAGS` accordingly. If we configure this stuff in `configure` then it feels like doing everything twice. Unless we ignore `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly in `configure` and wait for this until `sage-build-env-config.in`. There we could do

```
export SAGE_DEBUG?="@SAGE_DEBUG@"
```
and then build together all the flags according to `SAGE_DEBUG`.

Ok. I went back into `build/make/Makefile.in`. I think it works now.

If you run `make build SAGE_DEBUG=yes` without configuration, it will still assemble according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. You can even choose different flags with `make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package`. That will also work.

However `export SAGE_DEBUG=yes; make build` will not work, unless for some reason this will induce configuration.
