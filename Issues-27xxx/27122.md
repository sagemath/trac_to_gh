```
We should compile Sage with the extra compile argument `-march=native` for extra performance, at least if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is not set.

In `gcc/spkg_configure.ac` we check, whether the argument `-march=native` is accepted.

In `build/make/Makefile.in` we assemble the flags.

We add `-march=native` to the compiler flags, if not building fat binaries and the compiler and the package accepts it.

During the build of sage there are now the following flags that can be exported in `spkg_install.in` with one line, instead of checking `SAGE_DEBUG` etc. for each individual package, e.g. by
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above with `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` (flags as above without `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode, add `-march=native` if possible)
- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3_NON_NATIVE` (`O3` instead of `O2`, no `-march=native`)
- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)

Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.

We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if absolutely necessary for packages to work.

Inidividual packages can still be compiled with specified flags or in debug mode using

```
make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package
```
or

```
make SAGE_DEBUG="yes" some-package
```

Depends on #30375

-This would speed up those calculations depending on the architecture:

-- `f_vector` of `polytopes.permutahedron(8)` takes 1.6 seconds with intrinsics and 4.8 seconds without.

looks OK - not sure whether converting version to `float()` is normal practice, but that's minor.

I'm also not sure whether this will pass the argument to Cython, or it needs

`# distutils: extra_compile_args = -march=native`

in `*.pxd` files.

I believe it works, but I'm not entirely sure.

This seems to state that `sage/stats/distributions/discrete_gaussian_integer.pyx` was compiled with `-march=native`.

I have not set it with `CFLAGS`, in that case it would have appeared twice on the list.

Instead, why don't we try to set a decent default for CFLAGS if the user does not already have it set? Typically this amounts to something like

```
CFLAGS ?= -march=native -O2

in a makefile somewhere. For people who don't care, CFLAGS will get set to something nice, and setup.py will use that value. For the people who have set CFLAGS to something special, nothing goes wrong.

This is why I did it in the setup file.\n\nI'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.\n\nIdeally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.\n\n(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)",

I'd bet that our ./configure script is capable of doing that in a more reliable way, since it's something that C programs need to do often and python programs basically never. For example, I think we already check for a suitable version of gcc to see if we need to build our own. And we include an autoconf macro (m4/ax_c_check_flag.m4) that will try to compile a file using `-march=native`, and then report back if it worked or not.

Ideally, CFLAGS set in the environment will work everywhere, subject to upstream/spkg cooperation. But they definitely work in setup.py, so if we're able to detect these features at a higher level and then (by default) set CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to include them, more code would be able to benefit from it. The setup.py script would still pick them up from the environment, but anything else that respects the environment variables would benefit, too.

(I don't know off the top of my head that setup.py doesn't affect spkgs, but I would guess not.)

Thanks for the comment by the way. It makes sense to me.

I'm just very busy at the moment and didn't have time to see how that could be handled by the configure script.

Thanks. I basically did it like this.

I also added `-O0`, `-O2` and `-g` according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. This helps clean up a lot of code (basically every package sets those flags manually).

Finally, I used `src/bin/testcflags.sh` to remove unsupported flags.

The package `ecm` still adds `-march=native` on top of `CFLAGS` unless a similar flag is present.

Some packages prefer `-O3` over `-O2`, so I left the flag `-O3` as it is.

With this branch all tests passed on my end (ran distclean and installed all packages I touched).

Ok, I added a comment about that assumption.

Is this at a point where people can/should test it again?

Ok. Took a while, but it seems to work now. The test `sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/psage.py` only worked on retry, but I guess this is fine.

What I did was basically the following:

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin
$ make
$ sage -t --long --all
```
(install gcc)

```
$ make distclean
$ ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
$ make build; ./sage -i openssl; ./sage -f python3; ./sage -i pyopenssl; make build
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package | grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ")
$ sage -i sage_numerical_backends_coin; make; sage -t --long --all
```
(use system gcc)

I'm often having trouble with openssl and I don't exactly understand the problem (but the workaround seems to work), so I guess you can ignore that part.

I would suggest the following for others to test it:

- Pull ticket.
- Unset `CFLAGS` etc.
- `make distclean`
- configure to compile as you would usually do, plus add the following:

```
$ ./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " "
```
  so e.g. one would configure to compile with clang as follows:

```
$ CC=clang CXX=clang++ FC=flang ./configure $(./configure --help | grep -oP '\-\-with-system[^ =]+' | sort | uniq | sed 's/with/without/' | grep -v gfortran | grep -v gcc | past -sd " ")
```
- make sage
- install optional packages

```
$ ./sage -i $(./sage --optional | awk -F\. '{print $1}' | grep -v warnings | grep -v package |  grep -v gfort | grep -v buckygen |grep -v database | grep -v polymake | grep -v jupymake | paste -sd " ") sage_numerical_backends_coin
```
- test everything with `sage -t --all --long`

Report any (unusual) trouble you are having.

[https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/422709282](https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/422709282)

I pulled the newest develop and #29087 to run those tests.

It's really hard to see the difference to your run: [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/422167181](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/422167181). I'm reducing my attention here to those tests that suceeded for you:

- Problems with gsl for
  - ubuntu-xenial, minimal, ubuntu-latest
  - ubuntu-xenial, standard, ubuntu-latest

- Problems with gsl and libatomic_ops for
  - ubuntu-bionic, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - ubuntu-eoan, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - fedora-26, standard, ubuntu-latest
  - fedora-28, standard, ubuntu-latest

- Never ran the following:
  - ubuntu-bionic-i386, standard:

From this I gather that maybe one shouldn't use `-march=native` for those two packages. Does this make any sense?

<div id="comment:33" align="right">comment:33</div>

Can someone please help me with the following issue.

- conda-forge and homebrew-macos

```
  `/bin/sh: ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh: No such file or directory`
```
  The following line seems to be a problem:

```
+opt := $(shell export CC=$(CC) && ../../src/bin/./testcflags.sh $(opt))
```

Otherwise things are looking good, I would say.

Things have improved "by themselves" (of course not):

Now the current ticket (with #29087 merged) runs as smooth as the current beta [https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035](https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/65613035). However many tests got cancelled due to exceeding 6 hours.

Seems to work now:

Some strange fail in (debian-bullseye, standard):

```
cp: cannot create directory '/sage/local/./lib/python3.7/site-packages/Cython/__pycache__': File exists

Looks somewhat like a racing condition to me. Given that it bullseye suceeds on minimal and standard-python2, I would say it's fine.

Is this ticket anywhere near a positive review?

It would be nice to migrate my own implementation for bitsets for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to the one in `data_structures/bitsets.pxi`. That would prevent a lot of code duplication for #29191. But I would only do this, if I can modify `data_structures/bitsets.pxi` such that it uses intrinsics.

But, enabling intrinsics without `-march=native` as default would mean that a lot of code is never really tested as many cases are very dependent on the specific architecture (see #27103).

Looks like @vbraun is already merging it for 9.1.

In a test run for `ubuntu-trusty-minimal` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/617198833) I see a new error building gfortran:

```

Also #29575 (debian-jessie: fflas_ffpack again) is from that run.

So this may need some more work

What I'm getting from the failures above is the following:

Don't use `-march=native` as a default for gfortran and and python.

Require gcc at least 5.1 in addition to the checks here (this was my first approach, I don't find the bug anymore that caused me to think we need at least version 5.1, but certainly 4.9.2 isn't working for us).

This appears to be #28800. I'm currently using the original settings for
- pari (to fix this segemtation fault),
- fflas_ffpack,
- gfortran.

I'll push something, once I have more luck.

It seems that my approaches for disabling `-march=native` for certain packages don't work.

For ubuntu-trusty it tried to compile `gfortran` with `-march=native`, but I tried to disable that.

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/622914460?check_suite_focus=true

For linuxmint-19, python 2 I'm still getting the segmentation fault when building the documentation. So I'm suspecting that `pari` was build with `-march=native` against my wishes.

https://github.com/kliem/sage-test-27122/runs/622915243?check_suite_focus=true

I can keep on trying, but maybe someone that understands those scripts better than me finds a mistake. I would appreciate that.

Turns out my makefile syntax was completely wrong. But I think I got it figured out now and it should correctly determine the gcc version (and check correctly `SAGE_DEBUG` and `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`).

@embray: As you wrote a workaround that fixes segmentation faults when building the documentation in #28356, maybe you have an educated guess, which package might be causing the following problem. Currently I disable `-march=native` for the following:
- pari
- cypari
- pari_jupyter
- fflas_ffpack
- gfortran
- gcc (I'm not sure if `gcc/build_gcc` will do that, it seemed to help the gfortran issue however)
- linbox

sure, you are setting compilers' flags, and this is done in the files I pointed to.
E.g. in `build/pkgs/gcc/spkg-configure.m4` we have

```
    # Modify CXX to include an option that enables C++11 support if necessary
    AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11([], optional)
```
which adds if needed something to `CXXFLAGS`, etc.


> 
> This is usually done in `configure.ac` and is so already. If you don't set `CFLAGS` then `AC_PROG_CC()` will set `CFLAGS` to `-g -02` (or different order).

AC_PROG_CC only is called early in `configure.ac` to ensure general sanity.
As you might know, `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` are collected by `./boostrap` and used to
generate `./configure` from them and `configure.ac`. We have moved a lot of compiler-specific stuff into  `build/pkgs/*/spkg-configure.m4` when the latter were instroduced, and for a good reason.

What I meant by this was for the top-level configure to have an option `--enable-fat-binary` (or perhaps a better name for that) so that this is not controlled by an environment variable.

It seems that with the new approach things have improved. Or maybe some work has been done somewhere else.

- tox.ini:

  looks the same to me (new failure to push docker image for debian-jessie):

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966983

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808684

- optional:

  no new failure (although tests aren't all the way done yet)

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966981

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808682 

- `gcc_spkg`:

  some tests take half an hour longer, but I don't know if that has any say

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966986

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808677

- cygwin-standard:

  looks the same to me:

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966985

  #27122: https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808676

- cygwin-minimal:

  looks the same to me:

  beta1: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/actions/runs/134966984

  https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/136808673

Never mind. The environment variables `CFLAGS` never made it from `configure.ac` to anywhere else.

once again, settings of gcc flags are not to be done in `configure.ac` - as I explained, we already have all of them we currently set, set in `build/pkgs/{gcc,gfortran}/spkg-configure.m4`

Please move them accordingly, or if you have problem doing that, I can help, but doing compiler settings in two different places is verboden.

In `gcc` we futher analyse what the user has and figure out, whether this suffices.\n\nI agree that it makes sense to figure out the flags there as we are doing all those case distinctions already (what compiler are you etc, can you compile a basic file etc.). I'll take care of it soon, but not today (as for testing it shouldn't really make a difference, there are many open problems with this).",

Well, `configure.ac` runs `AC_PROG_CC()`, which sets `CFLAGS` to `-g -O2` if not set, so we must grep the user `CFLAGS` in `configure.ac` (it was already pointed out above that user input `CFLAGS` should not be overridden unless necessary).

If I get this right, `configure.ac` just barely checks if there is anything that can be used to at least build gcc. In `gcc` we futher analyse what the user has and figure out, whether this suffices.

I agree that it makes sense to figure out the flags there as we are doing all those case distinctions already (what compiler are you etc, can you compile a basic file etc.). I'll take care of it soon, but not today (as for testing it shouldn't really make a difference, there are many open problems with this).

And back to the old problems again.

https://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/140694723

There are sementation faults when building the documentation e.g. in ubuntu bionic.

However, I disabled `march=native` for pari and all packages depending on `pari` and that still didn't seem to fix the issue (according to the logs this seemed to work).

Something isn't thread safe from above probably as in #28800. I have no clue, about that and I'm left with disabling `march=native` for random packages and hoping that I have luck.

Or does anyone know how to get a meaningful log of the documentation build?

 We should compile Sage with the extra compile argument `-march=native` for extra performance, at least if `SAGE_FAT_BINARY` is not set.
 
-We use the `build/bin/testcflags.sh` script to check whether the toolchain will accept it. We do so in the makefile.
+Most of the work is done in the `gcc/spkg_configure.ac` and `gfortran/spkg_configure.ac`.
 
-Along the way we clean up sage's debug options. According to the documentation on building sage from source [https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/source.html) reasonable default flags would be
-- `-O2 -g` if `SAGE_DEBUG` is not set
-- `-O2` if `SAGE_DEBUG=no` and
-- `-O0 -g` if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`.
-At the moment, some packages do it that way, some don't (e.g. eclib always sets `-g` no matter what you do). There is also a lot of duplication, because every single package installer checks for `SAGE_DEBUG`.
+We also gather and clean up other compiler flags. In short we
+- add `--enable-fat-binary` to `configure` (as an alternative to setting `SAGE_FAT_BINARY`)
+- add `--enable_debug={no|symbols|yes}` as alternative to setting `SAGE_DEBUG`
+
+- compile with `-Og -g` if `SAGE_DEBUG=yes`
+- compile with `-O2` if `SAGE_DEBUG=no` (some packages with `O3` instead)
+- compile with `-O2 -g` otherwise (some packages with `O3` instead)
+
+We add `-march=native` to the later two, if not building fat binaries and the compiler and the package accepts it.
+
+During the build of sage there are now flags that can be exported in `spkg_install.in` with one line, instead of checking `SAGE_DEBUG` etc. for each individual package, e.g. by
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS` (redundant, use flags as above with `-march=native` if possible)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` (flags as above without `-march=native`)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3` (`O3` instead of `O2`, but only if not in debug mode, add `-march=native` if possible)
+- `export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3_NON_NATIVE` (`O3` instead of `O2`, no `-march=native`)
+- `export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS` (use `$CFLAGS` as set before `configure`)
+
+Likewise we do with `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `F77FLAGS`.
+
+We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if absolutely necessary for packages to work.

This old run, didn't have the new doctest failures.

As far as I understand, Maxima build process does not involve anything but a Lisp compiler, ECL in the case of Sage. And ECL compiles directly into object files, as far as I know.

So this is probably a red herring.

That would also explain why on homebrew-macos-python3_xcode there are so many new failures for standard, but not for minimal. (As this ticket here is supposed to influence minimal much more than standard.)\n\nSomething is going on either way, as even on 9.2.beta1 we have many time outs in `plot` and `manifolds`. So if I get an extra error in `sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes.pyx`, I don't even know if this is really bad or just random.\n\nBasically, I see the following options now:\n\n- revert the last two commits or not (independent of the other options):\n\n  I don't see an advantage in disabling `-march=native` for `pari`, but maybe that is really something we should do.\n- decide that the macos failures are either random or acceptable\n- disable `-march=native` for clang (but it is not said that things would improve for mac then)\n- someone has an educated guess about what I could do about the mac failures\n\nIt is possible however that some of the new mac failures are caused by the fact that the default `CFLAGS` is now `-g -O2` instead of just empty.\n\nFor an updated comparison, I started a mac only test on the current develop again:\nhttps://github.com/kliem/sage/actions/runs/148471033",

<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

The last commits don't make a difference as far as I can tell. But the new mac failures seem to be real random. They are also present here (which is a completely different ticket):
- local-macos (homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg, minimal) https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/785733405?check_suite_focus=true

I personally guess the new errors on mac are either random or caused by something else (some package updated maybe). That would also explain why on homebrew-macos-python3_xcode there are so many new failures for standard, but not for minimal. (As this ticket here is supposed to influence minimal much more than standard.)

Something is going on either way, as even on 9.2.beta1 we have many time outs in `plot` and `manifolds`. So if I get an extra error in `sage -t src/sage/plot/plot3d/shapes.pyx`, I don't even know if this is really bad or just random.

Basically, I see the following options now:

- revert the last two commits or not (independent of the other options):

  I don't see an advantage in disabling `-march=native` for `pari`, but maybe that is really something we should do.
- decide that the macos failures are either random or acceptable
- disable `-march=native` for clang (but it is not said that things would improve for mac then)
- someone has an educated guess about what I could do about the mac failures

It is possible however that some of the new mac failures are caused by the fact that the default `CFLAGS` is now `-g -O2` instead of just empty.

For an updated comparison, I started a mac only test on the current develop again:

I can confirm that the mac os errors also happen on a clean build from 9.2.beta1, so I think it has nothing to do with that ticket and is just somewhat random behaviour:

local-macos (homebrew-macos-python3_pythonorg, minimal)
https://github.com/kliem/sage/runs/810515848?check_suite_focus=true

had the following failures:

This definitely doesn't implement autotools semantics of "precious variables", but I think it is an improvement towards that.

Until now, every build of sage would pick up `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS` and `F77FLAGS` again from the environment. This is strange especially now that we have seperated `make` from `configure`.

Yes you can still set `SAGE_DEBUG`. However, if you configure with the option `--enable-debug=...`, it will override this variable.

Note also that this must now be done at configuration time.

I just checked. The following all work:

```
./configure --enable-debug=yes
```

```
./configure SAGE_DEBUG=yes
```

```
export SAGE_DEBUG=yes; ./configure

The problem is that what `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly does is to set `CFLAGS` accordingly. If we configure this stuff in `configure` then it feels like doing everything twice. Unless we ignore `SAGE_DEBUG` mostly in `configure` and wait for this until `sage-build-env-config.in`. There we could do

```
export SAGE_DEBUG?="@SAGE_DEBUG@"
```
and then build together all the flags according to `SAGE_DEBUG`.

Ok. I went back into `build/make/Makefile.in`. I think it works now.

If you run `make build SAGE_DEBUG=yes` without configuration, it will still assemble according to `SAGE_DEBUG`. You can even choose different flags with `make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package`. That will also work.

However `export SAGE_DEBUG=yes; make build` will not work, unless for some reason this will induce configuration.
