The current `is_simplicial` method returns `False` if the polytope is not full-dimensional.

```
sage: P = polytopes.simplex()
sage: P
A 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices
sage: P.is_simplicial()
False
sage: P.affine_hull().is_simplicial()
True
```

<a id='comment:2'></a>On a similar topic:
The method `is_simple` returns `False` when the polyhedron is not a polytope.
I would suggest to fix that since simpleness is defined for polyhedra, or just raise `NotImplementedError` like in `is_simplicial`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>I guess you could just delete `if not self.is_compact(): return False` in `is_simple`.
But for non-pointed polyhedra we should raise an `NotImplementedError` as it is really unclear what is intended in this case.

Then it just checks if every vertex is adjacent to d facets.

Add an example which shows what works correct now (the example from the description should be fine).

<a id='comment:5'></a>In any case, the current behavior of `is_simple` with polyhedra is not correct. This could be done in another ticket.

I added the simplex example in `is_simplicial`.

<a id='comment:7'></a>If we use the incidence matrix anyway, than we can just restrict to using it. Let n be the number of vertices.
Then a polytope is simplicial if and only if

```
not any(d < sum(M.column(i)) < n for i in M.ncols())
```

I guess the current solution was intended to change as little as possible.
