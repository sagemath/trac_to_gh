Old:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
sage: F = QuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ).Fundamental()
sage: %timeit [F(s(la)) for la in Partitions(7)]
1 loop, best of 3: 2.04 s per loop
sage: %timeit [F(s(la)) for la in Partitions(8)]
1 loop, best of 3: 8.8 s per loop
```

New:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).schur()
sage: F = QuasiSymmetricFunctions(QQ).Fundamental()
sage: %timeit [F(s(la)) for la in Partitions(7)]
10 loops, best of 3: 97.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit [F(s(la)) for la in Partitions(8)]
1 loop, best of 3: 331 ms per loop
