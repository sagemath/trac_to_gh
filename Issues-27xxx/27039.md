All these packages have standard autotools builds, so their transformation was mostly mechanical and trivial.  Only two slight exceptions:

* The `configure` script for deformation is not actually generated by autoconf and does not support all the standard options (e.g. `--libdir`).  However, the rest of it is straightforward.

* For mpfrcx we also add an `spkg-legacy-uninstall` script.

I've tested all of these and confirmed that they still build properly, and that the files listed in their file manifests look logical, and doctests pass for me on Linux. There should really be no difference for these packages compared to how they were previously built and installed.
