Currently the `libgap.GapElement` objects have a `__repr__` (but no explicit `__str__`, so the two are the same) which is taken from calling the GAP function `ViewObj` on the object and capturing and returning the result.  This is essentially the same as when you display the object in a GAP interpreter prompt without using `Print()`, such as:

```
gap> a := "hello";
"hello"
gap> a;
"hello"
```

Although GAP has many options for displaying/printing variables, this makes `ViewObj` the closest possible thing to the `__repr__` method on Python objects, which is called in similar circumstances:

```
>>> a = "hello"
>>> a
"hello"
```

This is in stark contrast with the pexpect interface's `GapElement` which (through a sequence of calls) effectively implements its `__repr__` by calling `Print(obj)`.  Arguably this was not the best choice, but changing it might be tricky at this point.  However, it does not explicitly implement `__str__`, so `GapElement.__str__` does give a sensible result in this case.

Arguably `Print(obj)` is the right choice for `__str__` since again in rough comparison with Python, when you `print(...)` an object in Python its `__str__` is called.

This proposes to change just the libgap interface to meet this specification: `libgap.GapElement.__str__` captures the output of `Print(obj)` and returns it.  While `libgap.GapElement.__repr__` captures and returns the output of `ViewObj(obj)`.

This gives the best of both worlds, and better consistency in *most* contexts where GapElements are converted to strings, making replacing pexpect gap with libgap easier and less disruptive.

Here is a branch for this specific change that I extracted from the rest of my work on #18267, since this change is worth considering in its own right.  Still needs a bit more testing to ensure it didn't inadvertently break any other tests.
