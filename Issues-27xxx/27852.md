<a id='comment:25'></a>Here are my comments on the current version:

The `insertion` and `rev(erse)_insertion` should be doing the insertion on a specific row, and going row-by-row should be done in the `forward_rule` and `backwards_rule`. Look at the amount of common code between the RSK and EG rules.

I prefer the original here:

```diff
-We can perform RSK and the inverse on a variety of objects::
+We can perform RSK and the RSK_inverse on a variety of objects::
```

`type-`A`` -> `type `A``

I think we should move all of the information about the different types of insertions to their respective rule class docs. It is better locality and the RSK module-level doc will only be looked at by the compiled documentation, so links will be sufficient.

`Returns` -> `Return` for 1-line docs (e.g., in `to_pair`). Similarly `Inserts` -> `Insert`.

`to_pair` does not need to return a `list` from what I see.

For `INPUT:` items, they do not start with a capital letter by convention, e.g.

```diff
-        - ``check_standard`` -- (Default: ``False``) Check if either of the
+        - ``check_standard`` -- (default: ``False``) check if either of the
```

Comments should be followed by at least one space.

I would move the `import` from `_forward_formatOutput` to the module-level. (Or does this cause an import cycle?) Same for the import of `from bisect import bisect_left`.

`_*_formatOuput` -> `_*_format_output`.

You should have the doc lines at most 80 chars/line (unless there is a really good reason to do so).

`rev_insertion` -> `reverse_insertion`

`Examples::` -> `EXAMPLES::`

I would just call `p_copy` `p` in `rev(erse)_insertion`.

```diff
-For precise information about I/O constrains, see the particular Rule class.
+For precise information about constraints on the input and
+output, see the particular :class:`~sage.combinat.rsk.Rule` class.
```

<a id='comment:28'></a>This is looking much better. A few more comments:

Change:

```diff
-                r = [j]; p.append(r)
-                qr = [i]; q.append(qr)
+                p.append([j])
+                q.append([i])
```

```diff
-d = dict((qij,i) for i, Li in enumerate(q) for qij in Li)
+d = {qij: i for i, Li in enumerate(q) for qij in Li}
```

I don't think the `insertion` needs to take the `qr` as you can have it have a `True/False` return value which then is handled by the `forward_rule` function (you always add to the end of the row).

I might have a few more additional comments, but this is all I have time right now to look at. However, you should now set this to needs review and put your real name as the author.

<a id='comment:32'></a>A few last little small details:

- For the `INPUT:` blocks, do not start bullet points with a capital letter.
- Remove the blank line before the closing `"""` in the docstrings (personal idiosyncrasy, but I think it looks better without it).
- Space after the `#` for comments (this is a PEP8 thing).
- In `the current insertion tableaux`, it should be the singular `tableau`.
- Remove all trailing whitespace.
- In `RuleEG`, the `TEST::` should be `TESTS:` and the text is overindented.
- For `insertion`, you can just return `None` if the letter was added at the end (so you can drop the `insertion_completed` variable).
- In `forward_rule` after the `else:`, indent the comments one step (i.e., 4 spaces).

Darij, I put you in cc in case you had any comments.
