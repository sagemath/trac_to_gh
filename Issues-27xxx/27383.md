There are doctest failures under Python 3 in eclib due to output from eclib being buffered instead of printed.

Python 2 uses the standard C library I/O functions from `<stdio.h>`. Typically, the C library implements buffering. Now Python 3 bypasses the C library for I/O and does direct system calls from `<unistd.h>`. The doctest framework always flushes the Python buffers after every test. Under Python 2, this actually flushes the `<stdio.h>` buffer which is the same buffer used by eclib (and other C/C++ libraries). But on Python 3, this only flushes the Python-specific buffer but not the `<stdio.h>` buffer.

I would argue that eclib should actually flush whenever it's "done" producing output. Note that `<< endl` flushes the output, so this is probably a matter of replacing some `<< "\n"` by `<< endl` in eclib, in particular in `mw::process()`. Alternatively, you could add an explicit `cout.flush()`.

Note that flushing too often can degrade performance. But I guess that I/O performance is not an issue for eclib (you aren't producing megabytes of output per second, right?). So then there is little reason to *not* use `<< endl`.

Indeed, this shouldn't require a new eclib release.

Concretely for this ticket, I would propose something like

Maybe this needs to be done in a few more places, but I really have no time to work on this now.

I don't think that the doctest framework is the right place to fix this. We want to fix this also in normal interactive usage, not just in doctests.
