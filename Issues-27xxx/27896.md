The function `sage.misc.sagedoc.skip_TESTS_block` is responsible for hiding TESTS blocks from the documentation, but the case below is not correctly handled. As a result, all the tests below the line `::` are *not* hidden from the documentation.

```
    TESTS:

    Some description::

        sage: 2 * 3
        6

    ::

        sage: 2 * 4
        8
```

This seems to be a common pattern for writing tests. For an actual example, check the end of the output of `ideal?` for instance, also available [here](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/ideal.html#sage.rings.ideal.Ideal).

Apparently, `::` gets interpreted as ReST header which can take the form

```
Header
::::::
```

This commit adds special handling of `::` to avoid this.

There is one pyflakes warning about an unused import of `sage.all`. However, that import is needed for the line:

```
x = eval('sage.all.%s'%obj, locals())
```
Removing the import makes the doctest of the corresponding function fail.

There is also a patchbot warning about insertion of triple colons. I am not sure what the intent of that warning is, but since I am using them in a regular expression, I guess that the warning is irrelevant. Otherwise, `:::+` can be replaced by `:{3,}`.

Is a single colon valid reST? Can we change the end of `header` from `|:|:::+)` to `|:::+)`

I suppose ideally, we would match a string of colons with matching text on the previous line, to make sure it really was a header, but we don't want to write a reST parser to solve this problem.

A reST header can have length 1 and can even look like this:

```
:
e
:

The Euler number.
```
This is indeed interpreted as header by Sphinx. If we disallow single colons nevertheless, this should also apply to the other characters.

I agree that ideally the line containing the header text should be taken into account, but it seems like a solution covering all the cases would add quite a bit of complexity for something that has not been a problem so far.
