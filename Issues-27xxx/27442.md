It is natural to write the elements of the (differential) Weyl algebra with the differentials factored out (on the right). This is a common expression for the elements in the single variable case.

With this branch

```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: D = DifferentialWeylAlgebra(R)
sage: t,dt = D.gens()
sage: x = dt^3*t^3 + dt^2*t^4
sage: x
t^3*dt^3 + t^4*dt^2 + 9*t^2*dt^2 + 8*t^3*dt + 18*t*dt + 12*t^2 + 6
sage: D.options.factor_representation = True
sage: x
(12*t^2 + 6) + (8*t^3 + 18*t)dt^1 + (t^4 + 9*t^2)dt^2 + (t^3)dt^3
```

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
A couple of small remarks:
1. `for e,g in`: Not sure if PEP8 would say `for e, g in` (space after comma) here. (found three times)
2. `[True,False]` (very last line of patch): here PEP8 for sure
2. Also `R.<x,y,z>`, `x,y,z,dx,dy,dz`, `t,dt` should IMO been written with space after comma.
3. `factor_differentials` is not doctested.
4. `(8*t^3 + 18*t)dt^1` (discussion): Should there be a `*` before the `dt`? (In some sense, this would be closer to a representation that one could feed back into the system and let it evaluate (i.e. correct Python syntax). However, I am aware that this might not be a major usecase (if at all).
5. Latex `d^{3}_{t}`: I simply do not know if this is the standard convention to write to typeset it; I simply believe you here and just wanted it noted.

Otherwise, LGTM.

PEP8 allows you to remove the space for operators when inside of a lower precedence operator. So IMO the no space is fine (and can be more readable). However, I don't care so strongly and have changed it.

> 2. `[True,False]` (very last line of patch): here PEP8 for sure

See above.

> 2. Also `R.<x,y,z>`, `x,y,z,dx,dy,dz`, `t,dt` should IMO been written with space after comma.

IMO, the `R.<x,y,z>` looks better and is easier to read (and fits PEP8 in the sense given above). However, I agree that there can be spacing for the list of generators, so I have changed those.

> 3. `factor_differentials` is not doctested.

Whoops, thanks. Fixed.

That is a good point. I have added that.

> 5. Latex `d^{3}_{t}`: I simply do not know if this is the standard convention to write to typeset it; I simply believe you here and just wanted it noted.

It was a good thing to note. In PDEs, people use d<sub>t</sub> for the derivative wrt t. However, in this case, I used the del/`\partial` notation, so I changed it to be consistent with that.

Ok, thank you for the explanation.

So, for me this everything looks fine. Once the patchbot is happy, this is a positive review.
