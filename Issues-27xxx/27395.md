Compare this in gp:

? genus2red(x^6+3)             
%1 = [59049, [2, -1; 3, 10], x^6 + 3, [[2, [5, [Mod(0, 2), Mod(0, 2)]], []], [3, [5, [Mod(0, 3), Mod(0, 3)]], ["[V] page 156", [3]]]]]
? genus2red(x^6+3,3)
%2 = [59049, Mat([3, 10]), x^6 + 3, [3, [5, [Mod(0, 3), Mod(0, 3)]], ["[V] page 156", [3]]]]
```
with sage:

```
sage: pari.genus2red(x^6+3)
[59049, [2, -1; 3, 10], x^6 + 3, [[2, [5, [Mod(0, 2), Mod(0, 2)]], []], [3, [5, [Mod(0, 3), Mod(0, 3)]], ["[V] page 156", [3]]]]]
sage: pari.genus2red(x^6+3,3)
[59049, [2, -1; 3, 10], x^6 + 3, [[2, [5, [Mod(0, 2), Mod(0, 2)]], []], [3, [5, [Mod(0, 3), Mod(0, 3)]], ["[V] page 156", [3]]]]]
```
It's obvious the second argument simply gets ignored.

Upstream (cypari2) fix: 

- https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2/pull/79

Fixed in cypari2 2.1.0, released 2019-03-04.

We upgrade to cypari2 2.1.0 in #27420.

**CC:**  @jdemeyer @slel

**Keywords:** genus2red, cypari2

**Upstream:** Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.

I would know how to make this change in sage. A big draw-back of having externalized cypari is that I don't know how to change or submit the change there.
