This used to work:

```python
sage: P.<x,y,z> = GF(32003)[]
sage: I = sage.rings.ideal.Cyclic(P)
sage: _ = I.groebner_basis('magma',prot='sage')
```

but now it doesn't, i.e. the "sage" filter isn't applied to the output.

Upstream: **None of the above - read trac for reasoning.**

Component: **interfaces: optional**
