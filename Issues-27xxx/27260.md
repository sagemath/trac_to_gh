Most of Sage's references are in the master bibliography file, `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`, but a few directories need attention.

- combinat (#28105, #28445)
- graphs (#28084, #28443)
- rings (#27498)
- schemes (#27556)
- random others: regressions? (#27500)

The attached files are the output from commands like `grep -R "\.\.[ ]* \[" src/sage/combinat` and then possibly deleting a few false positives.
