similar to ticket:27501 all_simple_paths  also fails to output all simple paths (as per definition) in case of multiple edges present inside the Digraph.

```
....: sage: eg = DiGraph(multiedges=True)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(0,1,1)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(0,2,3)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(1,4,3)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,3,5)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,4,15)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(2,4,12)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(4,5,7)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(4,5,8)
....: sage: eg.add_edge(5,6,2)
....: sage: eg.all_simple_paths(starting_vertices=[0],ending_vertices=[6])
```

it currently returns -

```
[[0, 1, 4, 5, 6], [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]]
```
 
but should return 


```
[[0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 1, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6],
 [0, 2, 4, 5, 6]]
```

Functions like all_paths_iterator also require some changes.

Also an option to report edges instead of vertices with or without labels is added.

There is a merge conflict in this branch.

You should not just get last version of `digraph.py`.

You should first update your develop branch

```
git checkout develop
git pull
make
```
And then rebase your branch on last beta, for instance like that

```
git checkout -b tmp develop
git fetch trac u/gh-rajat1433/27504_all_simple_paths_multi:tmp2
git merge tmp2 -m "trac #27504: Merged with 8.7.beta7"
```
you will get a message indicating that merge failed.

Then, open file digraph.py and search for `<<<<` to go to the line with the merge conflict. Fix it, and then commit the changes.

I have updated the all_simple_paths and its iterator codes.
Also added examples in all_simple_paths.
Next thing is to add examples in iterators.
If this gets reviewed I can start doing that.

- what does `empty` mean

```
         - ``data`` -- dictionary (default: ``empty``); optional parameter to
```
  it's not a Python keyword, right? By default you just have nothing. An alternative is to use `data=None` instead of `**data`...

- a more direct code

```diff
-                                edge_paths=[]
-                                edge_paths.extend(cartesian_product([my_dict[e] for e in zip(newpath[:-1], newpath[1:])]))
-                                for p in edge_paths:
+                                for p in cartesian_product([my_dict[e] for e in zip(newpath[:-1], newpath[1:])])
```
- simpler code with less tests

```diff
-                                if report_edges:
-                                    ep = list(zip(newpath[:-1], newpath[1:]))
-                                for _ in range(m):
-                                    if report_edges:
-                                        yield ep
-                                    else:
-                                        yield newpath
+                                if report_edges:
+                                    newpath = list(zip(newpath[:-1], newpath[1:]))
+                                for _ in range(m):
+                                    yield newpath
```

- instead of `if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict.keys():`, you can do directly `if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict: `

- You create `my_dict = {}` and later `dat = my_dict`. Why not using a single variable called `data` ?

- why are you converting the `Counter` to a `dict` ? I think you can pass the Counter to `_all_paths_iterator`. And just call it `data`.


- don't add uncessary empty lines

```
because the comment was place here because we had only one kind of returned format. Now that we have several, we can move the comment.
