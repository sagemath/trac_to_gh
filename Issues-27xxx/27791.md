Does that mean even if the list comes in a different order in py2 and py3 you will get an equivalent function by reconstruction ?

If this is the case what do you think is the best fix ? `#py2` `#py3` tags.

This all guesswork on my part, but I think so. The list is just giving the summands in two different orders. 

```
'push 0.0', 'push 12.0', 'load 1', 'load 2', 'dup', 'mul', 'mul', 'mul', 'add',
```
says to store 0, then store 12, take a factor of y ("load 1"), take a factor of z ("load 2"), duplicate it to get two factors of z, multiply (so you have `z^2`), multiply again (so you have `y z^2`), multiply again (to incorporate the factor of 12), then add to the 0 from the start.

With Python 3, it starts with the summand `9z^4` instead. The ordering in Python 3 seems to match the order in which the polynomial is actually printed, for what that's worth.

> If this is the case what do you think is the best fix ? `#py2` `#py3` tags.


How about a new doctest: instead of `list(ff)`, do something like this after the comment:

```
sage: g = (x*y**2*z)._fast_float_()
sage: list(g)
[ insert output here ]
```
Since there is only one summand, there should be no issues with orderings, and I think it still illustrates the same issue.
