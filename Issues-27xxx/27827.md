pkgconf is an implementation of widely used pkg-config.
In fact, pkg-config can be configured to look at certain directories, so we can use the one on the system.

This is what the branch does - it check for `pkg-config` presense,
and if it is there is sets up/updates the env.var. `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
in `src/bin/sage-env-config`. As `pkg-config` looks in dirs in `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` first, anything that Sage installs there overrides the system ones. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27827
