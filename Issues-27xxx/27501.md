As per my understanding this problem is arising because neighbor_out_iterator and neighbor_iterator methods are not able to return the iterator over vertices which are connected via multiedges they are only returning the vertices one time. I have looked into the graph backend files and couldn't find a function capable to return iterator over neighbors connected via multiedges.

As a solution to it I can write a function in backend capable of returning such iterator in case if the graph is multiedged that will be efficient too. (I found out_neighbors_unsafe method in sparse graph class which Gives all v such that (u, v) is an arc of the graph.) 
Alternatively, I can define an iterator myself in all_paths() function mimicking such functionality maybe by using edge_iterator to collect vertices connected via multiedges. I don't know which one is best. If there is any better ideas , I'll be glad to follow on that.

The neighbor iterator is doing exactly what it should. Even if you have 1000 edges between u and v, u has only 1 neighbor.

I think the easiest solution is:
- If the graph has multiedges, record the edge multiplicity
- Then, before yielding a path, compute how many time it should be returned (multiplication of # multiedges) and yield it than number of times.

For counting the edge multiplicity, I have a shorter solution:

```diff
         if self.has_multiple_edges():
-            edge_multiplicity = {}
-            for e in self.edges():
-                if (e[0], e[1]) in edge_multiplicity.keys():
-                    edge_multiplicity[(e[0], e[1])] += 1
-                else:
-                    edge_multiplicity[(e[0], e[1])] = 1
+            from collections import Counter
+            edge_multiplicity = Counter(self.edge_iterator(labels=False))
```
Try `Counter` to see how it works

For counting the multiplicity of path `p`, a more elegant version is:

```
m = prod(edge_multiplicity[e] for e in zip(p[:-1], p[1:]))
```
I don't know if you need to import `prod` from `sage/misc/misc_c.pyx`
}}}

These methods are simple and fast. Also a good way to avoid bugs.

Doing my best to help, but don't expect me to always answer so quickly...


TODO: add in the documentation of the method that if the graph has multiple edges, a path may be reported several times.

```
        If ``start`` is the same vertex as ``end``, then ``[[start]]`` is
        returned -- a list containing the 1-vertex, 0-edge path "``start``".

        If ``self`` has multiple edges, a path will be returned as many
        times as the product of the multiplicity of the edges along that path.
```

- please revert this change. No need for `::` here.

```diff

Looking at the errors induced by this ticket in `src/sage/quivers/path_semigroup.py` and `src/sage/quivers/representation.py` (see the patchbot), I realize that we are making a mistake in this ticket and in #27504.

In graph theory, 2 definitions of paths are used:
1. ordered list of vertices `s=u1, u2, ..., uk=t` such that there is an edge from `ui` to `ui+1`
2. ordered list of edges `(s=u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (uk-1, uk=t)`

Most of the time, when we use the list of vertices, we care about the existence of an edge from `ui` to `ui+1`, and so we want only 1 path.
But when we use the list of edges, we are more interested in the existence of many paths due to multiedges.


So, if you agree, I suggest to add parameters to:
* switch on/off the use of multiple edges, if any, sets to off by default to avoid changing the behavior for methods calling this one. A possible name could be `multiedges`. I don't have a better name in mind yet
* return list of edges instead of vertices (possibly with/without edge labels). A possible name could be `report_edges=False`, combined with `labels=False`.


The main difficulty will be to build all the possibles paths with edges and labels...
There might exist some macro to ease this operation.

I see the underlying problem.

- switch on/off the use of multiple edges, if any, sets to off by default to avoid changing the behavior for methods calling this one. A possible name could be multiedges. I don't have a better name in mind yet 

I think use_multiedges might be a suitable variable...

- return list of edges instead of vertices (possibly with/without edge labels). A possible name could be report_edges=False, combined with labels=False. 

I was thinking this for a long time to output paths as edges using labels, even wanted to include in my proposal I think it can be done for now using something like Cartesian Product function by adding the edges using edge_boundary.


```
    path_with_labels = []
    for p in all_paths:
        multiple_path=[]
        for i,u in enumerate(p):
            if i < len(p)-1:
                v = p[i+1]
                edges = g.edge_boundary([u], [v])
                multiple_path.append(edges)
        path_with_labels.extend(CartesianProduct(*multiple_path))
```

If it looks ok then I can start adding it.

`CartesianProduct` is deprecated, so you must use `cartesian_product(multiple_path)` instead.

Calling `edge_boundary` is quite expensive. You should better store all edges between u and v in a dictionary. When it's done, do `mydict[v, u] = mydict[u, v]` so that cell `(v, u)` points to the list of cell `(u,v)`.

I'm still thinking to the logic of these parameters. I'm not fully convinced by the choices done like if `label is True` then set other parameters to `True`. 

Anyway,
- parameter `label` should be `labels`, as for other methods like `.edges(labels=True)`

- would you agree with the following changes in the documentation

```diff
-        - ``report_edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);  if ``True``, then
-          edges are used instead of vertices in representing the path else by
-          default vertices are used to represent the path
+        - ``report_edges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); whether to report
+          paths as list of vertices (default) or list of edges
```

```diff
-        - ``use_multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``True``, then
-          multiple edges present between the nodes are taken into account for
-          finding all paths else these multiedges if present are ignored
+        - ``use_multiedges`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); this parameter is
+          used only if the graph has multiple edges. 
+
+          - If ``False``, the graph is considered as simple and an edge label
+            is arbitrarily selected for each edge as in 
+            :meth:`~GenericGraph.to_simple`
+
+          - If ``True``, a path will be reported as many times as the edges
+            multiplicities along that path (when ``report_edges = False`` or 
+            ``labels = False``), or with all possible combinations of edge labels
+            (when ``report_edges = True`` and ``labels = True``) 
```

```diff
-        - ``label`` -- boolean (default: ``False``);  if ``True``,
-          ``report_edges`` is automatically set to ``True`` and labels are
-          reported along with the edges. Also multiedges are also automatically
-          taken into account when label is ``True``.
+        - ``labels`` -- boolean (default: ``False``); if ``False``, each edge is
+          simply a pair ``(u, v)``of vertices. This parameter is ignored when
+          ``report_edges = False``
```

- this is better

```diff
             for e in self.edge_iterator():
                 if (e[0], e[1]) in my_dict.keys():
                     my_dict[(e[0], e[1])].append(e)
                 else:
                     my_dict[(e[0], e[1])] = [e]
-                if not self.is_directed():   
-                    my_dict[(e[1], e[0])] = my_dict[(e[0], e[1])]
+            if not self.is_directed():
+                for u, v in my_dict.keys():
+                    my_dict[v, u] = my_dict[u, v]
```

This was done because if labels were true and report_edges were false then there will be no point in labels being true as labels will make sense only if we were to output edges in the path. 

Like in shortest_path function of generic graph we say if weight_function is not None then by_weight parameter is automatically set to true.

To better illustrate the combinations of parameter, you should better use a simple example. Your examples are quite complex I think

```
sage: g = Graph([(0, 1, 'a'), (0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2,'c'), (1, 2,'d')], multiedges=True)
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False)
[[0, 1, 2]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True)
[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=True)
[[(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)], [(0, 1), (1, 2)]]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=True, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'c')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'c'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False, report_edges=True, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=False, report_edges=False, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd'))]
sage: g.all_paths(0, 2, use_multiedges=True, report_edges=False, labels=True)
[((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'b'), (1, 2, 'c')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'd')),
 ((0, 1, 'a'), (1, 2, 'c'))]
```

I think that the results with `report_edges=False, labels=True` are very confusing.
For me, setting `report_edges=False` means that I want list of vertices, not edges, and so that I don't care of edge labels.

Much better ;)
