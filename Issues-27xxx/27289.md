When running `./configure`, one gets a list of packages like

```
    pari_nftables-20080929
    pari_seadata-20090618
    pari_seadata_small-20090618.p0
    patch-2.7.5 not installed (configure check)
    pathlib2-2.3.3
    pathpy-7.1.p0
```
This message "not installed" is confusing because it really means that Sage will not install it.
