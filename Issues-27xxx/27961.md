I note that it talk about `libopenblas_haswellp-r0.3.5.dylib`. Shouldn't that be `0.3.6` instead? Was it from a building from scratch or an upgrade from the last beta?

does this happen with clang-compiled Sage?
And what Fortran?

Yes

A previously compiled gfortran-6.4.0, which I keep around just so I don't have to wait for Sage to build its own. I'll try with Sage's gfortran to see if that makes a difference, at least in issue 2.

I don't think issue 1 has much to do with OpenBLAS update, it's just a building problem.
For some reason `sage/matrix/matrix_rational_dense.so` didn't get rebuilt. I guess it might be Unicode values of strings involved in the description of this Extension in `src/module_list.py` - indeed, 

```
sage: import pkgconfig
sage: cblas_pc = pkgconfig.parse('cblas')
....: cblas_libs = cblas_pc['libraries']
....: cblas_library_dirs = cblas_pc['library_dirs']
....: cblas_include_dirs = cblas_pc['include_dirs']
....: 
sage: cblas_libs
[u'openblas']
sage: cblas_library_dirs
[u'/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local/lib']
```
and then one has

```
        libraries = ['iml', 'ntl', 'm'] + cblas_libs,
```
mixing `str` and `unicode` in Python 2, at least.

IIUC this is already the default set (somewhat to my chagrin) in sage-env:

```
626 # Multithreading in OpenBLAS does not seem to play well with Sage's attempts to
627 # spawn new processes, see #26118. Apparently, OpenBLAS sets the thread
628 # affinity and, e.g., parallel doctest jobs, remain on the same core.

631 # So we disable OpenBLAS' threading completely; we might loose some performance
632 # here but strangely the opposite seems to be the case. Note that callers such
633 # as LinBox use a single-threaded OpenBLAS anyway.
634 export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
```

unless we unset that when running the tests?

Replying to [vbraun](#comment%3A25):

That works, all tests pass. `config.h`, in case it's relevant:

```
#define OS_DARWIN	1
#define ARCH_X86_64	1
#define C_CLANG	1
#define __64BIT__	1

#define L1_DATA_SIZE 32768
#define L1_DATA_ASSOCIATIVE 8
#define L1_DATA_LINESIZE 64
#define L2_SIZE 262144
#define L2_ASSOCIATIVE 8
#define L2_LINESIZE 64
#define ITB_SIZE 2097152
#define ITB_ASSOCIATIVE 0
#define ITB_ENTRIES 8
#define DTB_SIZE 4096
#define DTB_ASSOCIATIVE 4
#define DTB_DEFAULT_ENTRIES 64
#define HAVE_CMOV

```
Now it's using "HASWELL" instead of "SKYLAKEX".

By the way, what should the workflow be? I ran `... ./sage -p openblas` and then `make`. I didn't see any obvious errors, but `make` fails, and in particular Sage doesn't start. Running `./sage -ba` fixes it. This seems like issue !#1 (from the ticket description): something in the Sage library is not getting rebuilt properly.

I think "HASWELL" is correct since AVX512 support is essentially the only new isa

Blas doesn't have any arch-dependent headers so it must be that some binary is linking against libopenblas_haswellp-r0.3.5.dylib instead of libopenblas.dylib. Then when you replace it with libopenblas-whatever-0.3.6.dylib it wont' work any more. On Linux its correct, so thats an OSX special. I've created #28008 to deal with that separate issue.
