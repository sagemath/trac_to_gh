NumPy 1.16.0 was released on 2019-01-14, and NumPy 1.16.1 on 2019-02-01.

- **Tarball**: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/2b/26/07472b0de91851b6656cbc86e2f0d5d3a3128e7580f23295ef58b6862d6c/numpy-1.16.1.zip

From the [release announcement for NumPy 1.16.0](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-January/079130.html):

> This is the last NumPy release to support Python 2.7 and will be

From the [Release announcement for NumPy 1.16.1](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2019-January/079157.html):

> This release fixes bugs reported against the 1.16.0 release, and
> also backports several enhancements from master that seem appropriate for a

>
> If you are installing using pip, you may encounter a problem with older

> particularly common on Debian derived distributions due to a modified pip.

Both release announcements indicate:

> The wheels on PyPI are linked with OpenBLAS v0.3.4+, which should
> fix the known threading issues found in previous OpenBLAS versions.
> Downstream developers building this release should use Cython >= 0.29.2
> and, if linking OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS > v0.3.4.


So this depends on the upgrade to OpenBLAS 0.3.5 (from 0.3.3) in #27020,
and on the upgrade to Cython 0.29.2 in #27058.

Debian developers warn us that NumPy 1.16 in Debian leads to
some deprecation warnings:

```
DeprecationWarning: np.asscalar(a) is deprecated since NumPy v1.16, use a.item() instead
```
These are fixed by adding a patch to matplotlib in #26288.

Editing ticket description now that NumPy 1.16.0 is released.

The release announcement for NumPy 1.16.0 warns:

> Downstream developers building this release should use Cython >= 0.29.2
> and, if linking OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS > v0.3.4.


So this depends on the upgrade to OpenBLAS 0.3.5 (from 0.3.3) in #27020,
and on the upgrade to Cython 0.29.2 in #27058.
