This should be easy, and it's a potential source of library conflicts, as gmp is often installed...

note that GMP is pulled in via `./configure --with-mp=gmp`
(as well as by specifying SAGE_MP_LIBRARY?)

here we check that GMP is new enough, by verifying it has a new function.
The rest is just copypaste.

To actually build with GMP, one needs

```
./configure --with-mp=gmp
```
(configure does the test regardless)

The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined toward `--with-mp=mpir` should mean that the MP library *must* by MPIR by explicit request of the user, and if not found on the system then we should build the SPKG.

If `--with-mp=` is not otherwise specified then we can take whatever MP lib was found on the system.

We should also add an `spkg-configure.m4` for MPIR.  We can impose an ordering (e.g. first check for MPIR, and then for plain GMP) by putting `AC_REQURE(SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_MPIR)` at the beginning of the `spkg-configure.m4` for gmp.  I did something similar for gfortran/gcc and seems to work.

FreeBSD provides GMP and MPIR, not  in GMP-compatibility mode (I looked at the corresponding makefile)
https://www.freshports.org/math/mpir
https://www.freshports.org/math/gmp

both are in /usr/local/ there. 

I would not be worried about a hypothetical situation of many libgmp's on the system
(in fact, MPFR has a very long configure script dealing with detecting all sorts of info about GMP (or a GMP-compatible thing)

I guess the main question is what to do with the `--with-mp=` flag in Sage's `./configure` script.  I don't think it necessarily needs to continue working exactly the same way, but whatever it does it should be sensible.  The way I see there are a couple possible ways to interpret it:

One way is that there are really three possible values:

- detect
- gmp
- mpir

where the default value is "detect".  In the "detect" case we just try to find the best working libgmp on the system and use it if found.  If not found the next fallback would be to install the mpir SPKG (the current default).  If passed "mpir" or "gmp" explicitly we don't bother detecting and just install the specifically requested SPKG.

Another possible interpretation is something more like:

- gmp
- mpir

where now default value "gmp" is similar to the first case: just try to detect *any* libgmp on the system to use, and failing that install an SPKG for some libgmp (where we might still use MPIR, but that fact is an implementation detail), whereas "mpir" means "detect MPIR *specifically*", which is to say find a libgmp that also, at a minimum, contains the `__mpir_version` flag.  Perhaps, for some reason, a user might specifically want to use MPIR e.g. for performance reasons.  If not found then we build the MPIR SPKG and use that.

Perhaps there are some other ways of interpreting/re-interpreting this flag, but those are a couple I have in mind.

Whereas if someone is explicitly passing `--with-mp=mpir` then the *really* want MPIR specifically, and we should not give them something that isn't it.

OTOH I'd also be curious in what cases MPIR gives better performance, and if we're doing users a disservice by not at least strongly recommending that they use it.   I think this is more a question for the mailing list though.  The details of what to do at `configure`-time can be malleable.

Perhaps we could leave the mpir-based toolchain aside for a moment, after all mpir is an optional package, so it is a bug if it is pulled in once GMP is chosen,
and concentrate on the rest of the surrounding number theory libs: mpc, mpfr, gf2x, ntl, pari.

So first we have to sort out why GMP is pulled in despite being recognised by configure as not to be installed, no?

---

Note that this spurious GMP installation isn't even triggered before some of spkgs dependent on GMP are installed, e.g. MPFR happily installs long before it's started on GMP.
I get

```
$ ldd local/lib/libmpfr.so
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcc02e9000)
	libgmp.so.10 => /usr/lib64/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007f9345368000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f9345199000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f9345696000)
```
but the beginning of MPFR install log says, wrongly,

```
  --with-gmp="/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local"
```
This is of course as expected, as it's hardwired in its spkg-install, as
`sdh_configure --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL"...`

It appears to me that instead the main `./configure` should set up something like `SAGE_GMP` to be either `SAGE_LOCAL` or a location computed by GMP's `spkg-configure.m4`, and then this `SAGE_GMP` must be used by MPFR...

I don't think I understand how the `.dummy` target for skipping "dummy" packages 
in `build/make/Makefile` works, in particular, why it's just a single `$(INST)/.dummy` file for all of them.

Or perhaps it's because `gmp` spkg is known as well as `$(MP_LIBRARY)`, and it's not found on the list of "dummy" packages, which duly includes `gmp`...

Pragmatically, I'd say that`--with-mp=foo` ought to always install `foo` from Sage's source, unless `foo=detect`. This is your first possibility from comment 9.
(And leaving it out would result in either picking up system's "GMP", be it real GMP or MPIR in compatibility mode.)

This is reasonably flexible. Experts who need special versions of GMP/MPIR may just update Sage's packages and use them, or install them system-wide.

Most of all, it would not need fiddling with recongising "hidden" MPIR in a system's  libgmp, something that would otherwise cater for non-existing systems, i.e. pure over-design for nothing and nobody...

Okay, let's go with that then, for now.  That would be good because it is also the most "backwards compatible" with the current behavior.

As for the `--with-gmp=` question, I keep thinking about it and I think this is the best thing to do:

* in the gmp/spkg-configure.m4 add support for our own `--with-gmp=` flag.  Most people
  won't need this, but it does provide some desirable flexibility.  This would just set the
  GMP prefix explicitly (and be saved to `$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`) to be passed on to other
  packages that look for a GMP

* when passed an explicit `--with-gmp` flag that should also imply that we *want* to use
  the system package, and if it can't be found this should be an error

* if a usable system GMP is detected (with or without `--with-gmp`) just go with it; if
  `--with-gmp` was not specified then we set `$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` to blank, and in that
  case explicitly do *not* pass `--with-gmp=` to other packages: let them just pick up
  the system GMP (note: I checked, and passing `--with-gmp=` with a blank argument is buggy
  in at least a few of these packages, so better not to use the flag at all in that case)

* if a usable system GMP is not detected we just build the SPKG as normal, with whatever
  option was selected by `--with-mp`, with MPIR by default and set `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

Here's my attempt at this:

Moved all the `--with-mp` logic into the `spkg-configure.m4` for MPIR so that it is local to where it is used. 

Also, most of the logic is in mpir/spkg-configure.m4 rather than gmp/spkg-configure.m4 just because MPIR is the implementation we install by default if it can't be used from the sytem.  It could go either way, but this way seemed a bit more logical for that reason.

Then, the gmp/spkg-configure.m4 is mostly just a stub.

Finally, uses the symbol `__gmpq_cmp_z` to check for GMP>=6.1.0 (or whatever the equivalent MPIR is).

So to summarize, by default `--with-mp=system` and it tries to use the libgmp from the system.  If that check fails it falls back to installing the mpir SPKG.  If `--with-mp=mpir` it just doesn't even check the system and installs the mpir SPKG; similarly for `--with-mp=gmp`.

I see no chaining in mpir/mpfr macros - if I intentionally break mpir recognition I still get mpfr not being installed, but picked up from the system...
---if I just run ./configire without parameters.

(I don't know whether this breaks builds or not, but I guess we would like to see in such a case, if mpfr is not available, mpfr being built as well)

This might have "interesting" interactions with what is to come on #27373.

I was just about to ask you about this.  I'm working on rebasing this on top of current develop (mostly straightforward but not trivial).  In the current upstream version of this branch, which you were the last to touch, gcc/gfortran was omitted in [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/3b6eebda8df1ae7fbc86f81c0fcf123989504447).  However, in my local copy of the branch it still includes them.

I was going to ask if that was intentional but now it's sounding like maybe it wasn't.  So I'll put it back in for now.

Once again, about nesting. Shouldn't e.g.

```m4
            AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmp.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
            AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmpxx.h, [], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
            dnl mpq_cmp_z appeared in GMP 6.1.0 and is used by pynac
            AC_SEARCH_LIBS([__gmpq_cmp_z], [gmp], [break],
                [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
```
be written as

```m4
            AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmp.h, [
              AC_CHECK_HEADER(gmpxx.h, [
                dnl mpq_cmp_z appeared in GMP 6.1.0 and is used by pynac
                AC_SEARCH_LIBS([__gmpq_cmp_z], [gmp], [break],
                   [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
              ], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])
            ], [sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes])            
```

And, by the way, what's that `break` doing there? I gather it's to interrupt loops, but there is no loop here...

A better solution isn't immediately obvious to me other than to make sure that all of the buildbot workers have up-to-date autotools installed and run `./bootstrap` as part of the normal build procedure.  I think that *should* be done but it's not always trivial I guess (e.g. on OSX?).

In the meantime I'm happy to follow the workflow as it is; it could just be confusing for all the tickets attached to #27330.  Maybe we can do something like bundle multiple of those tickets to be merged together once several of them have been otherwise positively reviewed individually.

I have no idea where this 314 can be found. If you update from source then upstream/configure-`xyz`.tar.gz might not correspond to anything at all, may not even exist.

E.g. my different sage builds, all based on 8.8.beta2, have different from 314 `xyz`.

I am tired of doing manually things that must have been automated 10 years ago.
Why is that `xyz` there at all?! The build is run by make, which is intelligent enough to know if a file has been updated, you know...

Actually, 8.8.beta2 has already configure-315.tar.gz. The version number is in build/pkgs/configure/package-version.txt, like all tarballs.

To make a new confball:
* merge in the latest beta (so you have the most up-to-date  build/pkgs/configure/package-version.txt)
* run `./bootstrap -s -i`
* Commit the new version and checksum, and upload the confball

Well, if you like I can install autotools on your OSX bot just from sources. (I recall doing that on OSX 10.12, it should still be possible on 10.14).
This would be vanilla enough then, still...

Do we have Linux buildbots without autotools installed?

Anyhow, one can have autotools installed in a non-standard location only buildbot knows, so that it can run ./bootstrap, and then it's as if there are not present.

It's hard for me to understand the problem without knowing how exactly a release is made.
(if be any chance you are in Berlin, you can show me - I'm here until 21st Apr).

I have had similar problems--not necessarily with NTL--but with other packages where having a copy of the development package already installed on my system created difficult to avoid clashes when trying to build some Sage SPKGs.  See e.g. #22768.  In that case it's more due to bugginess with Python's module build system, but I can envision similar problems in other build systems that make too many assumptions about your paths in some context.

I have a dozen tickets open that do change configure, see #27330.
For the purpose of testing the configure spkg versioning, today I attached
configure tarballs to 3 of them:
#27258, #27265, #27186. No matter in which order they would be merged, I'd need to re-do these tarballs for all but one, you know. This is not exactly entertaining...
