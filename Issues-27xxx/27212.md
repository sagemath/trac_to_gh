This should be easy, and it's a potential source of library conflicts, as gmp is often installed...

note that GMP is pulled in via `./configure --with-mp=gmp`
(as well as by specifying SAGE_MP_LIBRARY?)

The rest is just copypaste.

To actually build with GMP, one needs

./configure --with-mp=gmp

FreeBSD provides GMP and MPIR, not  in GMP-compatibility mode (I looked at the corresponding makefile)
https://www.freshports.org/math/mpir
https://www.freshports.org/math/gmp

both are in /usr/local/ there. 

I would not be worried about a hypothetical situation of many libgmp's on the system
(in fact, MPFR has a very long configure script dealing with detecting all sorts of info about GMP (or a GMP-compatible thing)

<a id='comment:9'></a>I guess the main question is what to do with the `--with-mp=` flag in Sage's `./configure` script.  I don't think it necessarily needs to continue working exactly the same way, but whatever it does it should be sensible.  The way I see there are a couple possible ways to interpret it:

One way is that there are really three possible values:

- detect
- gmp
- mpir

where the default value is "detect".  In the "detect" case we just try to find the best working libgmp on the system and use it if found.  If not found the next fallback would be to install the mpir SPKG (the current default).  If passed "mpir" or "gmp" explicitly we don't bother detecting and just install the specifically requested SPKG.

Another possible interpretation is something more like:

- gmp
- mpir

where now default value "gmp" is similar to the first case: just try to detect *any* libgmp on the system to use, and failing that install an SPKG for some libgmp (where we might still use MPIR, but that fact is an implementation detail), whereas "mpir" means "detect MPIR *specifically*", which is to say find a libgmp that also, at a minimum, contains the `__mpir_version` flag.  Perhaps, for some reason, a user might specifically want to use MPIR e.g. for performance reasons.  If not found then we build the MPIR SPKG and use that.

Perhaps there are some other ways of interpreting/re-interpreting this flag, but those are a couple I have in mind.

<a id='comment:11'></a>Perhaps we could leave the mpir-based toolchain aside for a moment, after all mpir is an optional package, so it is a bug if it is pulled in once GMP is chosen,
and concentrate on the rest of the surrounding number theory libs: mpc, mpfr, gf2x, ntl, pari.

So first we have to sort out why GMP is pulled in despite being recognised by configure as not to be installed, no?

Note that this spurious GMP installation isn't even triggered before some of spkgs dependent on GMP are installed, e.g. MPFR happily installs long before it's started on GMP.

```
but the beginning of MPFR install log says, wrongly,

```
  --with-gmp="/mnt/opt/Sage/sage-dev/local"
```
This is of course as expected, as it's hardwired in its spkg-install, as
`sdh_configure --with-gmp="$SAGE_LOCAL"...`

It appears to me that instead the main `./configure` should set up something like `SAGE_GMP` to be either `SAGE_LOCAL` or a location computed by GMP's `spkg-configure.m4`, and then this `SAGE_GMP` must be used by MPFR...

Okay, let's go with that then, for now.  That would be good because it is also the most "backwards compatible" with the current behavior.

As for the `--with-gmp=` question, I keep thinking about it and I think this is the best thing to do:

* in the gmp/spkg-configure.m4 add support for our own `--with-gmp=` flag.  Most people
  won't need this, but it does provide some desirable flexibility.  This would just set the
  GMP prefix explicitly (and be saved to `$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`) to be passed on to other
  packages that look for a GMP

* when passed an explicit `--with-gmp` flag that should also imply that we *want* to use
  the system package, and if it can't be found this should be an error

* if a usable system GMP is detected (with or without `--with-gmp`) just go with it; if
  `--with-gmp` was not specified then we set `$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX` to blank, and in that
  case explicitly do *not* pass `--with-gmp=` to other packages: let them just pick up
  the system GMP (note: I checked, and passing `--with-gmp=` with a blank argument is buggy
  in at least a few of these packages, so better not to use the flag at all in that case)

* if a usable system GMP is not detected we just build the SPKG as normal, with whatever
  option was selected by `--with-mp`, with MPIR by default and set `SAGE_GMP_PREFIX=$SAGE_LOCAL`.

It turns out doing this right is likely more trouble than it's worth, so I'm going to say "YAGNI" to this, until and unless proven otherwise. It turns out even most of the packages that have a `--with-gmp` flag in their own configures don't really implement it well.  As long as Sage is using the system GMP, this flag shouldn't really be needed anyways for compiling other packages against the system GMP.  So better to just leave it off entirely, at least when using the system package.

<a id='comment:33'></a>Here's my attempt at this:

Moved all the `--with-mp` logic into the `spkg-configure.m4` for MPIR so that it is local to where it is used. 

Also, most of the logic is in mpir/spkg-configure.m4 rather than gmp/spkg-configure.m4 just because MPIR is the implementation we install by default if it can't be used from the sytem.  It could go either way, but this way seemed a bit more logical for that reason.

Then, the gmp/spkg-configure.m4 is mostly just a stub.

Finally, uses the symbol `__gmpq_cmp_z` to check for GMP>=6.1.0 (or whatever the equivalent MPIR is).

So to summarize, by default `--with-mp=system` and it tries to use the libgmp from the system.  If that check fails it falls back to installing the mpir SPKG.  If `--with-mp=mpir` it just doesn't even check the system and installs the mpir SPKG; similarly for `--with-mp=gmp`.

This is still wrong because in that `case` statement, in the `system)` case you can still wind up installing the Sage SPKG if any of the checks fail (hence setting `sage_spkg_install_mpir=yes`).  That's why there is a separate `if/then` clause later.

I think the problem here is is with quoting.  You can see it in the configure log when running the previous version (and also fixing the `SAGE_MP_LIBRARY = mpir` line):

```
./configure: line 8899: test: too many arguments
```

I believe it's possible for `$sage_spkg_install_gmp` to not be defined here, so we need the `x` quoting.

<a id='comment:74'></a>`$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/sage-env-config` must get updated after, say, `sage -i mpir` (or any other dummy package that sets anything in the build environment). Currently this does not happen. This is a bug that leads to `sage -i mpir` breaking stuff. 

See #27373 to deal with this. (Hopefully everything that is on this ticket can stay as it is, so I don't flip it to "needs work")

I was just about to ask you about this.  I'm working on rebasing this on top of current develop (mostly straightforward but not trivial).  In the current upstream version of this branch, which you were the last to touch, gcc/gfortran was omitted in [this commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=03dc987c6d475279b0008fa8f5ba37a0045bb75e&id=3b6eebda8df1ae7fbc86f81c0fcf123989504447).  However, in my local copy of the branch it still includes them.

I was going to ask if that was intentional but now it's sounding like maybe it wasn't.  So I'll put it back in for now.

be written as

And, by the way, what's that `break` doing there? I gather it's to interrupt loops, but there is no loop here...

Do we have Linux buildbots without autotools installed?

Anyhow, one can have autotools installed in a non-standard location only buildbot knows, so that it can run ./bootstrap, and then it's as if there are not present.

It's hard for me to understand the problem without knowing how exactly a release is made.

I'm in Berlin, hit me up when you have some time. I'm located in the East (Elsenstrasse).

I have a dozen tickets open that do change configure, see #27330.
For the purpose of testing the configure spkg versioning, today I attached
configure tarballs to 3 of them:
#27258, #27265, #27186. No matter in which order they would be merged, I'd need to re-do these tarballs for all but one, you know. This is not exactly entertaining...
