I may have managed to fix this error. I don't know anything about the origins of the code but the error arises in in `graph_database._gen_interact_func` where it seems a string defining a function called `_` is run with `exec`.

I tried changing the name of the function that gets defined and ran into a different python3-related bug in the `sagenb` python package (maintained out of the main sage tree): it still uses `xrange` in `sagenb.notebook.interact` at line 1185.

I downloaded the source for that package, changed the uses of `xrange`, and now the doctest passes on my machine, but the bar for passing is simply emitting a string starting and finishing with `<html>` and `</html>`. 

I'm not sure what to suggest for this ticket, the doctest in question has something to do with the old sage notebook (sagenb). The function `interactive_query` returns some html that doesn't appear do anything in jupyter, and I can't use the old notebook on python3 (an error related to Twisted). Is the old notebook formally deprecated? See #22431 and in particular the 'side remark' about the graph database explorer.

If my changes to `_gen_interact_func` and the `sagenb` package are wanted I can send patches, but as I can't run the notebook myself on python3 I can't even verify that it's a proper fix.

Let's ask the author of #22431 if anything was said about `graph_editor` and interactive queries in `graph_database`.

Also I don't know if these tools have users. If not, we may simply deprecate the parts involving `sagenb`. Otherwise, someone with enough knowledge in notebooks should try to solve the issues.

As long as these changes don't break sagenb on python2, it is fine.
Please send a PR on https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb
(perhaps they are already fixed in the 4 most recent open PRs there.)

As to functionality to be removed, I don't know.

Thanks.  We may need to think about how to deal with this in the eventual removal of sagenb, as the interact should in principle still be able to work in e.g. Jupyter notebooks, but would have to import from elsewhere.  Cc:ing Jeroen as he knows a lot about how that is implemented in Jupyter and where things might need to import from now.
