This ticket adds a function to return elements of the s-gonal sequences. For example, this enables:

```
sage: tri = [polygonal_number(3, n) for n in [0..9]]
sage: tri
[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]
```

```
sage: square = [polygonal_number(4, n) for n in [0..9]]
sage: square
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

and

```diff
-    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, s = 3
+    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, `s = 3`
```

and

```diff
-    return (((n**2) * (s-2)) - (n * (s-4))) / 2
+    return (((n**2) * (s-2)) - (n * (s-4))) // 2
```

(the output should be an integer and not a rational).

Some more minor things I missed before.

- The arguments in the INPUT block are usually not sentences and end not with a period. See https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#input

- I would propose the following:

```diff
-    - ``s`` -- integer; the size of the polygon. For example, `s = 3`
-      returns a 3-gonal (triangular) number. `s` must be greater than 1.
+    - ``s`` -- integer greater than 1; the number of sides of the polygon
```

- The details from the input block about `s` are probably easier to read for a user on the example block as in:

```
EXAMPLES:

The triangular numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(3, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]

The square numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(4, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

The pentagonal numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(5, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117]

The hexagonal numbers::

    sage: [polygonal_number(6, n) for n in range(10)]
    [0, 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153]
```

- It would be great if the other examples could be shortly illustrated by half a sentence or so. (Maybe something as `The input is converted to an integer`).
