We change the mappings used in method `is_planar` from file `planarity.pyx` to avoid calls to `.vertices()`.

The changes done here were inducing a doctest error in method `genus` for

```
sage: cube.genus(circular=['01','10'], on_embedding=True)
```
As the documentation indicates that `If ``circular`` is defined, ``on_embedding`` is not a valid option`, we now raise an error in this situation.

This patch fixes some doctests that where failing with py3 in methods
- `TutteGraph` of `smallgraphs.py`
- `apex_vertices` of `graph.py`
- `genus` of `generic_graph.py`
