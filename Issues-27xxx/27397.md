Is this just for sagenb?  I'd suggest not supporting it on Python 3 at all (I know you've done a lot of work towards getting that working anyways but I'm not sure it's worth all the trouble since it's being deprecated anyways).

At the very least, maybe it can be missing some functionality (with appropriate warnings given).

I guess you could do something like

```
try:
    import twisted.mail
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = True
except ImportError:
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = False
    if <twisted version <= whatever>:
        # This is an actual error since an older Twisted version should have this
        raise
```

and later

```
if HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL:
    <do the thing>
else:
    warnings.warn("<this functionality is no longer supported, sagenb is deprecated, blah blah blah>")
```

I haven't looked at the relevant code though so I don't know how straightforward that would be in practice.
