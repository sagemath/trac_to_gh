Could this be related to different levels of compatibility of twisted with respect to different versions of py3 (3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, etc)

Because it seems that `twisted.mail.smtp` gets installed with the branch here, whereas it was not with our current version of twisted.

yes, this is just for sagenb. It currently fails to start because of these 2 missing modules of twisted.mail.  I remember that a brute force removal of these imports allow the notebook to start, but it looked ugly for some reason.

I guess you could do something like

```
try:
    import twisted.mail
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = True
except ImportError:
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = False
    if <twisted version <= whatever>:
        # This is an actual error since an older Twisted version should have this
        raise
```

and later

```
if HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL:
    <do the thing>
else:
    warnings.warn("<this functionality is no longer supported, sagenb is deprecated, blah blah blah>")
```

I haven't looked at the relevant code though so I don't know how straightforward that would be in practice.
