Strangely, this does not seem to install all files (on a python3-built sage)

For example, twisted.mail.relaymanager is not installed...

Could this be related to different levels of compatibility of twisted with respect to different versions of py3 (3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, etc)

Because it seems that `twisted.mail.smtp` gets installed with the branch here, whereas it was not with our current version of twisted.

yes, this is just for sagenb. It currently fails to start because of these 2 missing modules of twisted.mail.  I remember that a brute force removal of these imports allow the notebook to start, but it looked ugly for some reason.

I will not push hard for this ticket, but maybe we were almost there.. Sigh..

I guess you could do something like

```
try:
    import twisted.mail
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = True
except ImportError:
    HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL = False
    if <twisted version <= whatever>:
        # This is an actual error since an older Twisted version should have this
        raise
```

and later

```
if HAVE_TWISTED_MAIL:
    <do the thing>
else:
    warnings.warn("<this functionality is no longer supported, sagenb is deprecated, blah blah blah>")
```

I haven't looked at the relevant code though so I don't know how straightforward that would be in practice.
