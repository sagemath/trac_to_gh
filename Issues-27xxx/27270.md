this does not implement `--with-arb=...`, as I hope it's not needed.
And no other packages have `--with-arb=`, too.

Tests pass, apart from this amusing doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/misc/package.py", line 282, in sage.misc.package.installed_packages
Failed example:
    installed_packages()
Expected:
    {...'arb': ...'pynac': ...}
Got:
    {'.dummy': '',
     'alabaster': '0.7.12',
     'appnope': '0.1.0.p0',
...
```

Less amusing is that with arb manually installed to /usr/local on Gentoo Linux, I get a import error upon Sage startup, from deep inside sagelib.

I have to start Sage as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64 ./sage`, otherwise
I get 

```
ImportError: libarb.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
I do have `/usr/local/lib64` in `/etc/ld.so.conf`, by the way.
Does this mean we need do jump through some linking hoops here?

I certainly can add a proper runtime test in `spkg-configure.m4`, but why?

oops, my fault. Forgot to run ldconfig after the installation.

Needs a new confball. I'd suggest to merge this in 8.9.beta0 so hold the horses until 8.8 is out. 

You should remove the dependency on tickets that cannot be merged, the release script will wait until the dependencies are merged which, right now, is never.

with the latest branch on Debian buster, building `sage/libs/arb/arith.so` against system's arb (so it needs `-lflint-arb` and not `-larb` breaks with a linking error (as there is no `libarb`)

```
[sagelib-8.9.beta2] gcc -pthread -shared -L/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib -L/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/build/cythonized/sage/libs/arb/arith.o -L/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib -L/home/dimpase/sage/local/lib -lflint -larb -lgmp -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/arb/arith.so
[sagelib-8.9.beta2] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -larb
```

It apparently derives `-larb` somewhere in Cython, but where, and is there a way to override it?

Note that `-lflint-arb` is known to the global makefile:

```
build/make/Makefile-auto:LIBS = -lrw -lreadline -lmpc -lgf2x -lcurl -lbz2 -lflint-arb -lflint -lmpfr -lgmp -lm  -lntl

not really - it tests for a specific function from the "right" arb, I cannot imagine the other arb having it.

I tried that, but then you have to analyse the result of its run, and this leads to arcane code (one needs to strip `-l`, etc...)

The problem is that sagelib isn't autotooled, and so one needes to get arb/flint-arb strings into `# distutils libraries=` directives in Cython header files.

This ticket is a part of the unvendoring process. One way or another, the problem here is that arb library does not have pkg-config support, and yes, we want to support !Debian/Ubuntu arb package with non-standard naming.

alternatively I can store an environment variable in `src/bin/sage-env-config`
(which, as you know, is also created by `./configure` :-))
and then access it from `src/sage/env.py` to populate `ARB_LIBRARY`.

This would avoid creating `src/sage/env.py.in`.

I feel like you're arguing slightly different things here. Treating the sagelib package as just another package could in principle be done without removing any vendoring. You keep the current build system, add a `sagelib` package under build, add basically everything as a dependency for it. `sagelib` can then have its own `./configure`, which configure just sagelib and not everything else. Distros would have not problem running that.

the main configure configures "just" sagelib. What one has in `build/pkgs/` are vendored dependencies, which ought to disappear.
These little (or not so little) `spkg-configure.m4` scripts are part of the sagelib configure, they check that the deps are satisfied.
They have nothing to do with building the relevant deps (they deal with NOT building them).

Could you add a fallback for SAGE_ARB_LIBRARY in env.py? This wouldn't make any difference for users of the Sage build system (since it is set in sage-env-config) or distros that rename the arb library (which need to set it anyway), and would save distros that use the standard arb library name from having to worry about it
