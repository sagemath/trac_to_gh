One doctest is fixed replacing a call to `.edges()` by a call to `.edges_incident(1)`

For the doctest of `depth_first_search`, we distinguish py2 and py3. The ordering in py3 is unstable, so we use `...`.

For the doctest of `breadth_first_search`, we change the graph to ensure that there is a unique solution for the last visited vertex. So the same doctest is valid for py2 and py3.

**Keywords:** py3, graph
