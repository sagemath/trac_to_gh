This ticket is to upgrade to FriCAS 1.3.6 and track dependencies.

Tarball: see checksums.ini

Note that FriCAS has switched to using Git and the primary repository is now the one at GitHub, but the homepage remains at Sourceforge:

- https://fricas.sourceforge.net

and we still get source tarballs from Sourceforge since those available at GitHub are not the full source archives we need.

- http://fricas.sourceforge.net/
- https://github.com/fricas/fricas/releases

Our last update was to Fricas 1.3.5 in #25962 in February 2019.

To try this ticket from your Sage root directory, with `git-trac-command` installed:

1. `git trac try 27309`
2. `SAGE_SPKG="sage-spkg -o" ./sage -i fricas` (or use `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url` first)
3. `./sage -t --optional=fricas,sage src/sage/interfaces/fricas.py`
