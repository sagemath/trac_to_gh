I seem to recall mentioning on the mailing list (and a million other rants about OSX ;) that a frequent source of problems is mixing anaconda with homebrew with god knows what else.

Not even sure if that's *really* the problem here but it would be good to try to isolate these different packaging systems from each other to be sure.

<div id="comment:13" align="right">comment:13</div>

the problem with using `foo-config`, `pkg-config --modversion foo`, etc in `spkg-configure.m4` files is that this won't work out of the box as soon as the library `foo` is not installed in a place known to the compliler/linker.

the conservative way would be indeed to resort to `AC_CHECK_LIB` etc, whereas the way to unvendor more would be to actually use the info one can extract from `foo-config` etc to supply the needed extra flags to the build process.

With `PKG_CHECK_MODULES([FOO], [libfoo]...)` it is in fact easy, as it automatically populates the custom-named variables with compiler and linker flags, `FOO_CFLAGS` and `FOO_LIBS`.
So they can be written into sage-env-config and used by the dependencies of `foo`.
 
Perhaps we could experiment with this approach with Homebrew-provided libraries that get installed into `Cellar`. 

Anyhow, for curl one ought to use their ready autoconf macro, rather than reinvent the
wheel: [LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4)

Anaconda does provide pkg-config files, but unfortunately they do not include the rpath information either. Example, `/anaconda3/lib/pkgconfig/libcurl.pc`:

`@`rpath is an Apple magic rpath prefix to search a special list of paths, see e.g. https://wincent.com/wiki/%40executable_path%2C_%40load_path_and_%40rpath

Since its an Apple proprietary thing I'm not sure if a lot of thought was give to it on the conda or curl side, its possibly just something that xcode coughs up.

It seems that specifying `-rpath /path/to/conda/lib` when linking to it would suffice, but then we'd need to know first whether we want to link to conda or not. As always, Apple is geared towards shipping binaries to users and not to compile stuff yourself.

I'm willing to give this a positive review, but I'm not sure I see the point. At least with my setup, once I allow anaconda to modify the path, other things besides R break. For example, tachyon:

```
gcc -Os -ffast-math -DBsd  -DUSEPNG    -I/Users/palmieri/Desktop/Sage_stuff/sage_builds/TESTING/sage-8.8.rc2-anaconda3/local/include  -c ../src/pngfile.c -o ../compile/macosx/libtachyon/pngfile.o
../src/pngfile.c:33:10: fatal error: 'png.h' file not found
#include "png.h" /* the libpng library headers */
         ^~~~~~~
1 error generated.
make[6]: *** [../compile/macosx/libtachyon/pngfile.o] Error 1
```
So this looks like one small fix to a much larger problem.

maybe different versions of conda have different behaviour here, but on an installation I have, once you run "conda deactivate", the only addition to PATH contains `conda` and nothing else.

```
(base)~$ conda deactivate
$ echo $PATH
/home/dimpase/miniconda2/condabin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:...
$ ls /home/dimpase/miniconda2/condabin/
conda
```

While building Sage on "active" conda is not working, merely having a non-active installation should not break stuff. IMHO.

whereas

```
$ conda activate
(base)~$ echo $PATH
/home/dimpase/miniconda2/bin:/home/dimpase/miniconda2/condabin:/usr/local/bin:...
(base)~$ which curl-config 
/home/dimpase/miniconda2/bin/curl-config
```
prepends more things to `PATH`.

BRiaL only seems to look for gd if it can't use m4ri with libpng - see https://github.com/BRiAl/BRiAl/blob/master/configure.ac#L81

On OS X at least, when you install anaconda, it asks whether you want it to modify your shell scripts. If you say no, then whenever you want, you can run `conda init ...` to do that modification.
