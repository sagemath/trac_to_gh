To maintain compatibility, we must be able to import `CPXsetlogfile` **only if** version < 12.8 and `CPXsetlogfilename` if version >= 12.8. Then, we can use `CPXversionnumber` to adjust usage. 
  I don't know how to do that.

Not sure how to do that and where to put the code (`setup.py`, `module_list.py` ?).

Somehow, we want to extract line `#define CPX_VERSION               12080000` from `cpxconst.h`, extract the number and use it for conditional compilation.

It would have been easier with an optional package and a proper `spkg-install`... I don't know where to put it. These optional Cython modules are not very handy.

> Somehow, we want to extract line `#define CPX_VERSION               12080000` from `cpxconst.h`, extract the number and use it for conditional compilation.


I don't think that can be done directly from Cython. Here is a suggestion (similar to what is done in [PyNormaliz](https://github.com/Normaliz/PyNormaliz))
- run a configure script (or whatever) to obtain the value of CPX_VERSION and write a line "CPX_VERSION=12080000" in a file cplex_config.py
- in the setup.py script, use the `clpex_config.py` to define a compile time constant and branch appropriately in the Cython code

If you find an easier way to access the `CPX_VERSION` macro directly from a `.pyx` file that would be great!

```
OptionalExtension(...,

IF CPX_VERSION >= 12080000:

Since both versions of the code only use the `self.env` parameter you might want to isolate the `IF/ELSE` statement in a short `cdef` function.

<a id='comment:22'></a>I pushed a new branch, built on top of 9.0.bet4 and #28382 (but not #28708, so corresponding doctests are still here).

The changes are in file `cplex_backend.pxd`

```diff
-     # sets the log stream file
-     int CPXsetlogfile (c_cpxlp * env, FILE * f)
+     # Set the log file
+     int CPXsetlogfilename(c_cpxenv * env, char * filename, char * mode)
```
and in file `cplex_backend.pyx`

```diff
-        cdef FILE *ff
         if name.lower() == "logfile":
             if value is None: # Return logfile name
                 return self._logfilename
             elif not value:   # Close current logfile and disable logs
-                check( CPXsetlogfile(self.env, NULL) )
+                check( CPXsetlogfilename(self.env, NULL, NULL) )
                 self._logfilename = ''
             else:             # Set log file to logfilename
-                ff = fopen(str_to_bytes(value), "a")
-                if not ff:
-                    raise ValueError("Unable to append file {}.".format(value))
-                check( CPXsetlogfile(self.env, ff) )
+                check( CPXsetlogfilename(self.env, str_to_bytes(value), "a") )
                 self._logfilename = value
```

The drawback of this branch is to loose compatibility with cplex versions prior to 12.8, but since it is more than 2 years old and that the current version is 12.9, this is certainly OK.
May be we should add something in [http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html) ?
