The JSON files written to `$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed/` are syntactically invalid on OSX due to the filenames in the the `files` list not being quoted.  I believe this may be a regression introduced in #26011.  In particular the `sed` command in the line

```
FILE_LIST="$(echo "$FILE_LIST" | sed 's/^\(.\+\)$/"\1"/; 2,$s/^/        /; $!s/$/,/')"
```

does not work at all correctly with the BSD sed on OSX.

The main impact of this is that packages cannot be properly uninstalled, which may in turn have had various snowball effects on OSX builds.

This works for me. I can now uninstall packages successfully.

Note that independent of this ticket, some manifests have empty file lists: gap, python3 (but not python2), libhomfly are some examples.

Edit: I think I'm wrong about this. libhomfly is an example, but not the others: they have proper manifests.

I can't get this to work with Python: `$FILE_LIST` can be too long, apparently, at least the way I was trying to do things: something like

```
FILE_LIST=`sage-system-python -c "from sys import argv; s = ',\n      '.join(['\"' + x + '\"' for x in argv[1].split()]); print(s)" "$FILE_LIST"`
```
The file manifest for Python 3 was too long, so it ended up completely blank.

I think I can do everything in bash, though. Ugly but it seems to work. I'll post a branch once I'm done building.

The script starts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, so bash-isms are fine.

I just checked some timings. On my machine, `boost_cropped` has one of the largest file manifests, and also the package itself is quick to install. With the `develop` branch:

```
real	0m21.080s
user	0m7.821s
sys	0m12.785s
```
With this branch:

```
real	0m21.285s
user	0m7.959s
sys	0m12.966s
```
For the `pari_galpol` packaged mentioned at #26011, with `develop`:

```
real	0m21.661s
user	0m3.776s
sys	0m17.486s
```
With this branch:

```
real	0m20.393s
user	0m4.042s
sys	0m15.856s
```
So timing is not an issue, I think.

I think that would belong on a separate ticket; I want to get this problem fixed quickly.

I'm also not sure how to do it. If it's a doctest, it would fail for everyone using OS X, unless it's lenient about the format. Or would it run (once?) when you start up Sage? What did you have in mind for a schema?

There should be guidance in the developer's guide about for example: what directories can be assumed to exist when writing code for the Sage library or Sage scripts, what sorts of doctests should be avoided and/or are incompatible with distros, etc.

I'm not sure how much support there is, either. If you want more support, more documentation is always good.

---

In this particular case, the doctest could perhaps be changed to something like: if the directory `SAGE_SPKG_INST` exists, then check the validity of the file manifest.

Oh nevermind I misread my own build script. SAGE_LOCAL/var/lib/sage/installed is where I install those files to.

The issue is that there is no central authority to say that there is or isn't support. But I think at least Erik has been pushing in the support direction.

> In this particular case, the doctest could perhaps be changed to something like: if the directory `SAGE_SPKG_INST` exists, then check the validity of the file manifest.


Back to my first question: what are the usecases for these manifests?


And to answer your question: As a generalization, trac tickets that only touch "sagelib" (i.e. most stuff under `src/`, the actual math library) shouldn't need any special attention for distros. Similarly, everything that only changes the build system/"package manager"/"sage-the-distro" aspects of sage (most stuff under `build/`) should be fine, since distros don't use any of that.

Issues are likely when a ticket touches both sagelib and sage-the-distro. For example when a package is updated and the sagelib doctests have to be adjusted because of some minor precision changes, all distros will have to cherry-pick the doctest fixes when they update the dependency (solution for this is not to limit the precision of the doctests to something realistic instead of just adjusting them with every dependency update). Another example is when, like it is the case here, aspects of the build system are tested. The nicest solution for this would be Erik's plan to separate sagelib and sage-the-distro. The whole `package.py` file doesn't serve any purpose on distros.

Sorry if this is a bit hard to follow, I can imagine the separation between sagelib and sage-the-distro is something non-packagers don't think about often. I'd be glad to clear up any unclarity. By the way, if you run a linux machine you could test-drive the sage nix package if you feel like it :)

> Back to my first question: what are the usecases for these manifests?


Here's what I said above: Installing and uninstalling packages are the reason for the manifests: if you want to uninstall a package, which for example is part of upgrading a package, Sage uses the file manifest to know which files to remove.

There was a bug in writing the manifests which caused packages to not be removed properly, and fixing that bug motivated the doctest.

Sorry, I asked again because I wasn't completely sure if the mentioned usecase was the only one.

> Installing and uninstalling packages are the reason for the manifests: if you want to uninstall a package, which for example is part of upgrading a package, Sage uses the file manifest to know which files to remove.


Okay, so in that case it should be fine to continue to ignore those manifests on distro. Thanks for the explanation :)

Yes I thought about that too, maybe something similar to #26110 with a `# optional - buildsystem` that is enabled by default. Distros can then skip that.

Its not perfect since some distros will differ in how they handle certain things (for example #27230 introduced a doctest that fails on nixos although no functionality is actually broken, but will probably work on most other distros). But a lot of stuff could be covered, pretty much all of `package.py` for example.

This could be seen as a first step of separating sage and the sage build system, so Erik may have an opinion on that.

>  If so, then in addition to being able to specify it directly when running "sage -t", maybe there could be a way of trying to intelligently detect whether to set it.


I think intelligent detection isn't that important: Just enable it by default (since most manual runs of sage tests will be in a non-distro context) and let distros disable it (as it only needs to be done once).

New ticket please.

I would just change the test to try/except and ignore errors if the file does not exist.

It also occurs to me that the `package_manifest` function should not use `os.environ['SAGE_SPKG_INST']` but rather should probably take that value from `sage.env` (and add it is a variable to `sage.env` if one does not already exist).

See #27621 for the distro question and #27622 for getting `SAGE_SPKG_INST` from `sage.env` instead of `os.environ`. (They're separate issues and one has an easy obvious fix. The other I'm not so sure about.)
