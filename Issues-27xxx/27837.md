The short representation `S` for signs non-growth group is not self explanatory which might confuse some user. For roots of unity groups, we switch to `UU`. E.g.:

```
        sage: GrowthGroup('QQ^n * n^ZZ')
        Growth Group QQ^n * n^ZZ * Signs^n
        sage: GrowthGroup('(QQ_+)^n * n^ZZ * UU^n')
        Growth Group QQ^n * n^ZZ * UU^n
```
These changes also avoid the clash one has when using single letter variables.

This is a follow up for the sequence of tickets #26587, #26588, #26681, #26682, which were merged in a recent beta.
