Currently given a `Graph` (or a `DiGraph`) `G` its graph6 (or dig6)
representation is produced via the auxiliary method `sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph._bit_vector`. This method converts vertices to integers from `range(n)` and then produces a binary string recording (directed) edges. The conversion is done basically via `enumerate(self)`. 

Suppose that `G` has already vertices labelled by `range(n)`. Then in Python 2 the
above conversion does nothing and the correspondence
position_in_the_resulting_string --- edges_of_`G` depends uniquely on `n`.
On the contrary, since in Python 3 dictionaries are read in insertion order, the
correspondence depends heavily on the way in which `G` is created.

This makes the resulting string unreliable

```
sage: dg = DiGraph([(0,1,1)])
sage: dg.relabel({0:1,1:0})
sage: DiGraph(dg.dig6_string()) == dg # Python 3
False
sage: DiGraph(dg.dig6_string()) == dg # Python 2
True
```
and creates several doctes failures in `sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver`.
This ticket proposes two alternative solutions to this problem.

Solution 1: replace `enumerate(self)` by `enumerate(sorted(self))` in
`_bit_vector`. This keeps the current behaviour at the price of a (small?)
slowdown.

Solution 2: enforce the fact that graph6 and dig6 representations make sense
only for graphs with vertex set `range(n)` and raise an error otherwise. (The current code silently encodes an isomorphic graph.) Then use this directly to access vertices.

To put things in perspective, these representations are barely used outside of `cluster_algebra_quiver` so neither solution would have a big impact on other code. On the contrary in `cluster_algebra_quiver` they are used extensively as a way of comparing isomorphism classes of quivers. This is not the right way of doing so (one should use `sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.canonical_label` instead) but, personally, I do not thing that reimplementing  `cluster_algebra_quiver` is worth the effort.

Consider the following example with Python2 and Solution 1 (i.e., using `enumerate(sorted(self))`). You get:

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomTree(20)
sage: G.graph6_string()
'S??W??@???o??o@A?O?AG?CG??@_?A??W'
sage: V = G.vertices()
sage: shuffle(V)
sage: G.relabel(perm=V, inplace=True)
sage: G.graph6_string()
'So??g??AA??GH???G??_Aa??@o?C???G?'
```
The graph6 string depends on the way vertices are labeled and so cannot be used to check isomorphisms, unless you ask for the graph6 string of a canonical form.

So what should be done is:
- fix `canonical_form` for Python3 (#27571)
- rewrite `cluster_algebra_quiver` to properly check isomorphisms, that is using `canonical_form` and not graph6 string

You are confusing the labeling of the vertices and the canonical labels. 
In the example of #comment:2, the vertices are labeled in [0..n-1], but we get different bit vectors.

Now, if you take the canonical form, you get in Python2 with the current release of Sage:

```
sage: G = graphs.RandomTree(20)
sage: G.graph6_string()
'S?GG?A?GK??G????GO?O???G?IC_APA??'
sage: V = G.vertices()
sage: shuffle(V)
sage: H = G.relabel(perm=V, inplace=False)
sage: H.graph6_string()
'SGAA?_???@?@?AQOG????C?A?_??`_P??'
sage: G.canonical_label().graph6_string()
'S???????C?GC?A?C???@_K?CK?_?E?E@C'
sage: H.canonical_label().graph6_string()
'S???????C?GC?A?C???@_K?CK?_?E?E@C'
```
This is however not working in Python3 as `canonical_label` must be fixed.

No, I am not making this confusion but I am probably not explaining my point clearly enough. Let me try again.

In #comment:2 you build two *isomorphic* graphs both labelled by `range(n)` and  `graph6_string` gives different encodings. This is, I think, the correct behaviour.

What I am saying is that in Python 3 if you take two copies of the *same* graph built differently you get different encodings. And this in not the correct behaviour.

Here is an example (it is a bit convoluted because I need to force a different ordering of vertices in `H`):

```
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.add_vertices([0,1])
sage: G.add_edge((0,1,'a'))

sage: H = DiGraph()
sage: H.add_vertices([1,0])
sage: H.relabel({0:1,1:0})
sage: H.add_edge((0,1,'a'))

sage: H == G
True

sage: G.dig6_string() == H.dig6_string()	# Python 2
True

sage: G.dig6_string() == H.dig6_string()	# Python 3
False
```

This issue has nothing to do with `canonical_label`.

This will do what you ask for. On the way, it fixes the problems with the Petersen family generator (#26800).

I'm wondering if we should add a specific doctest and what to put in.

I can confirm that something is very wrong here. I compiled a fresh version on a different machine (with a similar undelying linux version for the record) and I get

Oupsss, I know, I have bliss... and canonical_label uses bliss by default if installed.

I get with Python 2 and 3:

```
sage: P = graphs.PetersenGraph()
....: v = P.random_vertex()
....: P.add_cycle(P.neighbors(v))
....: P.delete_vertex(v)
....: P.canonical_label()._bit_vector()
....: P.canonical_label().edges()
....: 
'011010100000011100100010010100100111'
[(0, 2, None),
 (0, 4, None),
 (0, 6, None),
 (1, 2, None),
 (1, 3, None),
 (1, 7, None),
 (2, 8, None),
 (3, 5, None),
 (3, 6, None),
 (4, 5, None),
 (4, 7, None),
 (5, 8, None),
 (6, 7, None),
 (6, 8, None),
 (7, 8, None)]
....: P.canonical_label(algorithm='sage')._bit_vector()
....: P.canonical_label(algorithm='sage').edges()
'001100001111000000011010100110100011'
sage: P.canonical_label(algorithm='sage').edges()
[(0, 3, None),
 (0, 5, None),
 (0, 8, None),
 (1, 2, None),
 (1, 5, None),
 (1, 7, None),
 (2, 4, None),
 (2, 8, None),
 (3, 4, None),
 (3, 7, None),
 (4, 6, None),
 (5, 6, None),
 (6, 7, None),
 (6, 8, None),
 (7, 8, None)]
```
So we must add `algorithm='sage'` to the doctest.

Note that there is no error here with the canonical label. It is not unique and depends on the algorithm. It might become more consistent with #27571.

For me with Python 2 on OS X:

```
$ ./sage -c 'set_random_seed(0); P = graphs.PetersenGraph(); v = P.random_vertex(); P.add_cycle(P.neighbors(v)); P.delete_vertex(v); print(P.canonical_label(algorithm="sage")._bit_vector())'
001100001111000000011010100110100011
```
With Python 3:

```
$ ./sage -c 'set_random_seed(0); P = graphs.PetersenGraph(); v = P.random_vertex(); P.add_cycle(P.neighbors(v)); P.delete_vertex(v); print(P.canonical_label(algorithm="sage")._bit_vector())'
101101100011000010010001011000010110
```
Maybe `set_random_seed(0)` is not necessary: I seem to get the same answers without it.
