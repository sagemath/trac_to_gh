The goal is to implement a method in the class `RibbonGraph` that draws the thickening of the ribbon graph and the ribbon graph inside as a spine. 

We also aim to implement a method that draws cycles in the graph. In this way we can visually see the action of the monodromy given by a `TatGraph` on the homology of the surface.
