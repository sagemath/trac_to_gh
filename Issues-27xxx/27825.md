(Wall-of-text alert. There's a tl;dr at the end, but I've dumped my reasoning for review so that we don't accidentally break some case I haven't thought of.)

For posterity, we [discussed the iconv dependency on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/pXJXLNzJa48).

The libgd package has an [automagic dependency](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Quality_Assurance/Automagic_dependencies) on iconv, meaning that it has optional support for iconv that is enabled automatically if a suitable iconv is present at build time. At that point, iconv is no longer optional, because libgd will be compiled to call some iconv functions, and will potentially be linked to libiconv.

Moreover, there are a few ways that "libiconv" can be implemented. On modern linux systems, the calls are all part of glibc, which is why you don't see libgd being explicitly linked against iconv on those systems. However, on other operating systems, GNU libiconv is indeed installed as a separate package, and you will find libgd linked against it on those systems.

Now, I don't believe that [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) uses any of the iconv support in libgd. The only [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) file to call a GD function is `matrix/matrix_mod2_dense.pyx` (someone confirm this?), and it doesn't pass any strings to the API. The only place iconv is used in libgd is in `src/gdkanji.c`, and it's used for manipulate string encodings. So, [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) shouldn't need it.

As a result, I don't think iconv should be a dependency of the [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) libgd package, but there are some conflicting goals here that I'll catalogue:

1. We'd like the libgd built by sage to be consistent across platforms. That is, it should either have iconv support or not, regardless of the OS.
2. We'd like the detected system libgd to be as consistent as possible with the one that sage builds; however...
3. We don't want to force the system libgd to be built with a specific configuration with regards to iconv, because that will prevent the system package from being used in a lot of cases where it otherwise could.

There's no perfect solution for all three, and in my opinion the third is the most important, which forces us to choose between (1) and (2). The two associated plans of action are,

1. Leave the iconv dependency in libgd, and accept a system libgd with no such support.
2. Drop the iconv dependency in libgd, and take whatever happens.

The second option means that the libgd built by sage won't be consistent, but it does bring the sage package to parity with the system package check. And, it's simpler. So finally,

**tl;dr** I think the practical solution is to

* Remove iconv from libgd's dependencies
* Remove iconv from libgd's SPKG.txt
* Write spkg-configure.m4 without mention of iconv (like Dima just did).

We should still check it ourselves, for the same reason we need the redundant libpng in libgd's `dependencies`: if freetype ever drops the libpng dependency, someone would be within his rights to remove that check from the freetype macro, and would have no idea that it's going to break libgd.

That breakage will manifest on some weird system a year later, and it will take us a lot more time to track it down then than it will to play it safe now.

The module `sage.matrix.matrix_mod2_dense` turns out to be the only one that actually uses libgd.  And as I noted in #27901 the need for it is actually highly dubious.  For now I don't have the bandwidth to argue with it, but it seems likely to me that it's a dependency we can drop at some point.

In any case, that module tends to depend on more libraries than most others, in part due to the use of libgd, but not solely.  Also, the libgd on Cygwin is built with all of its dependencies.  With this an other related fixes on Cygwin I get:

        cygXau-6.dll => /usr/bin/cygXau-6.dll (0x3f7540000)
        cygXdmcp-6.dll => /usr/bin/cygXdmcp-6.dll (0x3f7490000)
```

So the only libraries coming from Sage and not from the system are:

* iconv (high priority to fix this one IMO)
* python
* m4ri

Pretty good progress I'd say!

As I have now have iconv's spkg-configure.m4, on #27823, we could go ahead and add the dependency on it for libgd.

by right, however, it only needs testing if system's libgd is linked to libiconv, and I don't quite know how to check this (there is a deprecated gdlib-config script one can call, though)
