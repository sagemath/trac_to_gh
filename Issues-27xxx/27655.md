Consider a manifold covered by two coordinate charts:

```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: Y.<u,v> = M.chart()
sage: X_to_Y = X.transition_map(Y, [x+y, x-y])
sage: Y_to_X = X_to_Y.inverse()
```
and define a vector field from its components in the manifold's default vector frame:

```
sage: M.default_frame()
Coordinate frame (M, (d/dx,d/dy))
sage: M.default_chart()
Chart (M, (x, y))
sage: v = M.vector_field(-y, x, name='v')
sage: v.display()
v = -y d/dx + x d/dy
```
Currently (Sage 8.7), if we would like to express `v` in terms of the coordinates `(u,v)`, we have to write

```
sage: v.display(Y.frame(), Y)
v = v d/du - u d/dv
```
This is because the first argument of `display` is the vector frame with respect to which the expansion of `v` is performed and the second argument is the chart in which the components are expressed. If the latter is omitted, the default chart is assumed:

```
sage: v.display(Y.frame())
v = (x - y) d/du + (-x - y) d/dv
```

Now, it occurs quite often that one wants to express a tensor field entirely in terms of a given chart, i.e. with the components w.r.t. the coordinate frame associated to the chart and each component being expressed in terms of the coordinates of the chart. In Sage 8.7, if `Y` is not the default chart, this is possible only through `v.display(Y.frame(), Y)`. This ticket introduces the possibility to pass only the chart to  `display`, with the understanding that the vector frame with respect to which the expansion is to be performed is the coordinate frame associated with this chart. In other words, `v.display(Y.frame(), Y)` can now be shorten to `v.display(Y)`:

```
sage: v.display(Y)
v = v d/du - u d/dv
```

Sorry for what is likely a dumb question, but are you sure it is this ticket? I just have absolutely no idea how those failures could be related to this ticket. I agree that all the patchbots for what seems to be just ticket have massive breakage, but it seems to come from the `mpmath` library, which is not touched by this ticket.

> It went away after unmerging this ticket, so seems to be the case

I confirm the errors reported by the patchbot: on my computer, after merging the ticket branch in Sage 8.8.beta2, I get 

```
sage: complex(erf(3*I))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-af6acac02c0b> in <module>()
----> 1 complex(erf(Integer(3)*I))

/home/eric/sage/8.8.develop/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx in sage.symbolic.expression.Expression.__complex__ (build/cythonized/sage/symbolic/expression.cpp:11230)()
   1441             return self._eval_self(complex)
   1442         except TypeError:
-> 1443             raise TypeError("unable to simplify to complex approximation")
   1444 
   1445     def _sympy_(self):

TypeError: unable to simplify to complex approximation
```
The error raised in `self._eval_self(complex)` seems related to mpmath, as pointed in [comment:10](#comment:10):

```
sage: erf(3*I)._eval_self(complex)
...
TypeError: Cannot convert mpz to sage.rings.integer.Integer
```
However I am completely puzzled: how could possibly the code in this branch alter mpmath?
We have 

```
./sage -tp --long src/sage/manifolds/
```
returns "All tests passed!", but the other parts of Sage are impacted as the patchbot says, for instance 

```
./sage -t --long --warn-long 48.3 src/sage/functions/exp_integral.py  
```
returns "93 doctests failed"...

The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that we shall not import anything from `src/sage/manifolds` into `src/sage/tensor/modules` in order to keep the pure algebraic part completely separated from the manifold one. In the above commit, I propose to restore the ducktyping in the check of the basis nature of the first argument of `FreeModuleTensor._preparse_display` but in a much safer way than what was done previous to the commit in [comment:5](#comment:5), namely by

```
elif not isinstance(basis, FreeModuleBasis):
```
instead of

```
elif isinstance(basis, Chart):
``` 
In this way, we do not have to import `Chart` from the manifold part, but only `FreeModuleBasis`, which pertains to the algebraic part. Moreover, it is much safer: if `basis` is a true module basis and (for some reason) has an attribute `frame()`, it will never mistakenly be replaced by `basis.frame()`.

In the current setting, the lazy import is no longer necessary (I have however kept it). Do you think the comment is still appropriate? Shall we revert to the direct import?

I've noticed that in the manifold part, all imports are lazy ones, except for the catalog, while here (`src/sage/tensor/modules/all.py`) it was a true import.

I think that is a bad to false argument. The fact that this code means there is some interaction between the two.

It has to do with startup time. A lazy import means that it will not get resolved right away, which means things that are not needed at startup are not loaded. Since the manifolds has a lot of imports internally, we want to lazily import the block rather than do it at startup. While the import is usually not something we typically notice as humans, the startup time issue has a lot of these and is death by a 1000 needles.

I will leave the higher level decisions to you on that. Just let me know what you want me to review. `;)`
