This is ready for review now. Note that often external NTL packages are built without `gf2x`, but `gf2x` is merely an optimisation. 

Perhaps, to be completely on the safe side, `spkg-configure` should check whether `gf2x` is in, and if it is, only use system's NTL if `gf2x` will come from the system, too.
(But I  don't know how to check whether `gf2x` is used in NTL, at least not in an OS-independent way).

Trying to get this to work now.  I rebased it on current develop and reworked it similarly to #27259.  I also have it check if we are installing the gf2x SPKG or not (we really need a utility macro for dependency handling).

But I get this:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the ntl SPKG ===
checking installing gmp/mpir? ... no
checking installing gf2x? ... no
checking NTL/ZZ.h usability... yes
checking NTL/ZZ.h presence... yes
checking for NTL/ZZ.h... yes
```

but then nothing.  I don't see any output related to the `AC_LINK_IFELSE` and `AC_RUN_IFELSE` commands.  I guess one of them is failing (I will check config.log next).

I guess these macros just don't have any default output?  If not, we should add some.

with clang on OSX, I just saw a failure to recognise NTL, due to c++ in the test called without `-std=gnu++11`.

Adding `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC])` just above `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])` in NTL's spkg-configure.m4 fixes this.

But this seems to be a not very consistent way to do thing, as `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` ought to be called before the any other library tests. Do we have a way to force this?

hmm, no, this does not work, as at this moment `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` is not defined.

I am thinking of putting it into `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, but this means it's a recursive call, so the only way I can think of would be avoid the recursion:
to define essentially a copy of 
`SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, without this call, and then define `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` using this copy. After  this  `AC_REQUIRE(...)` would not involve a recursion.

I have opened #28005 to deal with this.
