This is ready for review now. Note that often external NTL packages are built without `gf2x`, but `gf2x` is merely an optimisation. 

Perhaps, to be completely on the safe side, `spkg-configure` should check whether `gf2x` is in, and if it is, only use system's NTL if `gf2x` will come from the system, too.
(But I  don't know how to check whether `gf2x` is used in NTL, at least not in an OS-independent way).

Trying to get this to work now.  I rebased it on current develop and reworked it similarly to #27259.  I also have it check if we are installing the gf2x SPKG or not (we really need a utility macro for dependency handling).

But I get this:

```
configure: === checking whether to install the ntl SPKG ===
checking installing gmp/mpir? ... no
checking installing gf2x? ... no
checking NTL/ZZ.h usability... yes
checking NTL/ZZ.h presence... yes
checking for NTL/ZZ.h... yes
```

but then nothing.  I don't see any output related to the `AC_LINK_IFELSE` and `AC_RUN_IFELSE` commands.  I guess one of them is failing (I will check config.log next).

I guess these macros just don't have any default output?  If not, we should add some.

I see. It doesn't even enable the NTL interface if you don't pass `--with-ntl`. Also if you use `--with-ntl` without an argument it assumes you want `/usr/local` which is also not so good. It might be mostly harmless but I want to double-check because that could be confusing. 

There are several things that are not so good about flint's hand-written configure script. I've offered to redo it with autoconf but Bill Hart complained that he didn't want to have to learn autoconf. And while I can completely understand the sentiment I think the fact is it would be better and much simpler if it did use autoconf. There's nothing much fancy it needs to do...

yes, it won’t link ntl unless ‘—with-ntl’ is present.

Welcome! You are not the first one to offer. The worst thing about it, is that it infects "descendant" projects such as `arb`. `arb`'s configure script is just a tweaked version of the `flint` script.

with clang on OSX, I just saw a failure to recognise NTL, due to c++ in the test called without `-std=gnu++11`.

Adding `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC])` just above `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GMP])` in NTL's spkg-configure.m4 fixes this.

But this seems to be a not very consistent way to do thing, as `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` ought to be called before the any other library tests. Do we have a way to force this?

Replying to [@embray](#comment%3A80):
> It might work to just manually call `AC_REQUIRE([SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC])` right at the beginning of `SAGE_SPKG_COLLECT`.

hmm, no, this does not work, as at this moment `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` is not defined.

I am thinking of putting it into `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, but this means it's a recursive call, so the only way I can think of would be avoid the recursion:
to define essentially a copy of 
`SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE`, without this call, and then define `SAGE_SPKG_CONFIGURE_GCC` using this copy. After  this  `AC_REQUIRE(...)` would not involve a recursion.
