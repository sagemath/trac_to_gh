As reported in [Ask SageMath question #45863](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45863/memory-usage-strictly-increasing-on-sage-interactive-shell/):

```
import gc
for x in xrange(10^5,10^5+100):
    s = sum(RDF(pi) for n in xrange(x))
    del(s)
    print "memory usage: " + str(get_memory_usage()) + ", gc: " + str(gc.collect())
```

The same happens with the other [mathematical constants](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/constants/sage/symbolic/constants.html).

The problem does not occur when `RDF(pi)` is replaced by e.g. `RDF.pi()`.

My guess based on `trace("RDF(pi)")` is that it has something to do with caching.

It's not a leak on the python heap (gc.get_objects() doesn't report anything new), so it's probably not caching, but a memory leak in some library code that gets used.

Changing `RDF` to `RR` or `RIF` also leaks; using `float` does NOT leak. That might help a bit in pinning down where the leak occurs.

Drilling down yields that `pi._convert({'parent':float})` does not leak and `pi._convert({'parent':RDF})` does.

This rather directly leads to `self._gobj.evalf(0, kwds)`, i.e., a call in pynac. That's the most likely candidate for the leak.

I suspect this is indeed the same problem. Now, we're seeing intervalfield elements pile up and a positive thing: because they have pointers themselves, the GC actually tracks them, so we see them on the python heap! (RDF don't need to be tracked by the garbage collector; ref counting does the trick for them, because they can't generate cycles. Neither can RIF elements, but python doesn't know that. Both intervalfield and complex elements carry two pointers to real numbers. So I guess that's why we're seeing them, but not the realnumbers themselves, because they are leaves in the reference tree, as far as Python knows)

I get:

```

Counter({"<class 'dict'>": 4000, "<class 'sage.rings.real_mpfi.RealIntervalFieldElement'>": 4000, "<class 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'>": 3999, "<class 'tuple'>": 5, "<class 'list'>": 2, "<class '_ast.Interactive'>": 1, "<class 'function'>": 1, "<class 'set'>": 1})
```
Backtracking these elements on the heap gets you nothing, though! So as far as I can see, there are no other python heap opjects that hold references to these objects. An incref/decref disparity somewhere would cause that. Alternatively, links are being held outside the python heap (that's not illegal! They could be on the C stack or C heap)
It's surprising to see "dict" leak in addition to mpfi elements.

The incref here is probably sometimes required, and perhaps always. It does seem to match with:

On the other hand, here:

https://github.com/pynac/pynac/blob/7ba3e4580e21e05d9272988e0aa94ed0b218ea19/ginac/numeric.cpp#L770

it seems the reference is NOT stolen (as is done in numeric types elsewhere). So perhaps that incref simply needs to be removed.
