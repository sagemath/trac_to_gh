Usain Boltz is a !Python/Cython/C++ library that automates the random generation of tree-like structures.
It allows to describe a combinatorial structure using a specification in the style of “Analytic Combinatorics” and, using the Boltzmann sampling framework, it produces a fast, uniform, and approximate size sampler of objects described by this specification.

Hi Martin!

the species implementation is currently undergoing the long awaited overhaul.  Travis and I have just finished a lazy series implementation, which is much more robust than what we had previously.  Ticket #32367 replaces the old (and somewhat unreliable) LazyPowerSeries with our new one.

Do you think we should try to see whether a uniform user interface for defining a grammar is possible?

Hi all ! To be transparent, we had an informal discussion this afternoon with Martin Pépin about that same issue !

If you remember, a long time ago (before covid), i proposed to have a general meeting of all people interested in making a plan for the whole analytic combinatorics stuff in Sage (species, ore algebras, (multi-variate, lazy, etc) power series, Bolzmann samplers, singularity analysis, asymptotic expansions, etc). Most people answered positively but wanted to postpone the date, unfortunately the delays were too short as the grant was ending. Maybe, we could revive the idea. What do you think ?

Hi!

First an important note: Matthieu and I (temporarily) moved away from this ticket about 3 years ago as we decided to implement a standalone python library [available here (usainboltz)](https://gitlab.com/ParComb/usain-boltz). This means that the branch tied to this ticket is obsolete and should not be used.

That being said:

1. It doesn't prevent us from adding usainboltz to sage! Adding it as an optional package seems right to me (is it?)

2. I agree with you that having a uniform user interface for defining grammars would be great. And the species, if they work, seem to be a very good candidate to me. I'd love to see some nice integration with usainboltz (and other existing tools) so that sampling objects described by a species becomes as simple as:

```python
>>> sampler = my_specy.get_boltzmann_sampler()
>>> sampler(size_in=[1000, 2000])
<some big object>
```

I'm all in to work on this as well!

I added usainboltz as a pip package following https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/packaging.html#python-based-packages.

But something must be wrong with what I did, I can't install usainboltz using `sage -i`:

```
$ ./sage -i usainboltz
[ a log of log about sage checking if it needs to rebuild stuff ]
Error: package 'usainboltz' not found
Note: if it is an old-style package, installing these is no longer supported
```

Note that `./sage --optional` and `./sage --info usainboltz` both see usainboltz. I might need a bit of help to understand what is happening.

@@ -1,13 +1,5 @@
-The Boltzmann method is a framework that describes how to build a uniform random generator for a family of discrete structures from a grammar describing  that family.
+Usain Boltz is a !Python/Cython/C++ library that automates the random generation of tree-like structures.
+It allows to describe a combinatorial structure using a specification in the style of “Analytic Combinatorics” and, using the Boltzmann sampling framework, it produces a fast, uniform, and approximate size sampler of objects described by this specification.
 
-Our goal is to design a high-level and user-friendly API with :
-* handling of grammars for monovariate/multivariate and unlabeled/labeled/increasingly labeled structures.
-* use of the state of the art oracles (newton iteration, multiparametric tuning, etc)
-* fast sampling of large structures (size 1e6 and more)
- 
-In this ticket we provide a implementation of the Boltzmann method introduced by Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard and Schaeffer (see [DuFlLoSc04](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/DuFlLoSc04.pdf)) with the following features :
-* labeled and unlabeled classes defined with +, *, Seq and recursive definition
-* an oracle dealing with explicit generating function
-* an oracle based on the work of Darasse (see [his thesis](http://www.ortsa.com/lip6_these/docs/these.pdf)) : less accurate but more generic

Yes it is indeed interesting. How do I benefit from this?
Will sage's pip use the optional `cvxpy` package if I add it as a dependency? Or do I need to switch to the `normal` package format for usainboltz`? I'll be happy to do so if it's considered better.

Btw, Thierry told me a few days ago that our (only “real” dependency `paganini` might be of interest for sage as well. Another good reason to package everything as `normal`?

Replying to [Matthias Köppe](#comment%3A46):

I fixed the compilation issue with clang (at list on my setup).

Would you mind checking whether `sage -pip install git+https://gitlab.com/ParComb/usain-boltz#master` works for you before I release a new version? That would be really nice.

A few warnings are to be expected because cython does not produce fully c++11 compatible code (https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/4687). I don't know to what extent this is a problem.

By the way, I just noticed you seemed to use gcc from the log you pasted.
Is this a mistake or is `gcc` an alias for `clang` in your setup?

On macOS, the `gcc` binary provided by Xcode is a compatibility shim around Apple's version of clang.

#34251 is waiting for reviewers...

> Will sage's pip use the optional `cvxpy` package if I add it as a dependency? Or do I need to switch to the `normal` package format for usainboltz`? I'll be happy to do so if it's considered better.


When #34251 is merged, we should add `cvxpy` to `build/pkgs/usainboltz/dependencies`.
This will avoid the conflict (possible races in parallel builds) between installing `cvxpy` from our package and getting `cvxpy`.

There's no need to switch `usainboltz` to `normal`.

I can't comment on this; it's outside of my domain of mathematical expertise.

>  Another good reason to package everything as `normal`?


No, I'd say it's best to set things up as `pip` packages as you did. The additional maintenance burden (upgrade tickets) with `normal` packages is typically only warranted if we have tight integration of the provided functionality in Sage.
