A few explanations: there was some numerical noise. Also, one doctest in `multi_polynomial.pyx` (`list(ff)`) relies on a specific ordering in a dictionary, so it seems easiest to mark the test as "random". The test

```

in `pbori.pyx` truly does seem random: I get a different answer each time I try it (start a new Sage session and run the command: I get different answers each time).
