As discussed in #27213, when we initialize libgap, we pass it the `-s` flag which according to the docs is 'set the initially mapped virtual memory', to a size determined by `sage.interfaces.gap.get_gap_memory_pool_size()`, which on my system happens to be ~3GB.

This is fine, in general, as it's an amount that's available to my system.  Nonetheless, in most usage (especially e.g. in the test suite) most of this will not be used.

I have to look into exactly how this memory gets allocated, but however it's being allocated it is unfortunately "committed" memory, meaning that although those pages are allocated lazily, they are guaranteed by the system to be made available for that process, so regardless whether those pages are actually in RAM, space is still reserved for them.  So perhaps it uses sbrk to expand the process's heap.  When the process is forked, Cygwin's `fork()` has to copy the parent process's heap into the child.  This has the unfortunate effect of accessing those pages, causing them to become allocated in physical memory (even, apparently, if they're clean / unused).

This is essentially the same issue we faced with PARI in #22633, but applied to GAP.  In fact, GAP's code sets the default value of the `-s` flag to 0 on Cygwin, presumably for reasons related to this.  This might be possible to avoid, as was done in PARI, by instead allocating this memory with `mmap` and `MAP_NORESERVE`.

That makes me wonder... if it's good enough for Cygwin, would it be good enough to do that on all systems unconditionally?

So to answer your question, no that would not be a good idea on any systems, really.

I tried applying a patch for GAP (just on Cygwin) to use MAP_NORESERVE when mmap-ing the GAP pool.  When I run GAP directly, or even when I run the GAP API tests (in the GAP sources, that is) it appears to work fine, at least superficially.

However, when I use the libgap interface in Sage with this patch, it immediately segfaults:

```

An error occurred during signal handling.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

```

which is completely bizarre and I can't explain it.  I will dig in a bit to see what is happening here...

<a id='comment:15'>Comment 15:</a>
This adds a patch to GAP, which works fine on plain GAP but for use in Sage also requires #27384.  By design the patch only affects GAP on Cygwin.  In principle the same change could be made on other systems that support `mmap()` with the `MAP_NORESERVE` flag, though it's not clear whether or not that's strictly desirable. 

It just means we can allocate a virtual address range for GAP's objects to live in up to any arbitrary size supported by the system, without regard to whether there is enough physical memory to use that entire address space (either at the time of allocation or sometime in the future) so it's still possible to run out of memory and get memory errors.

The reason this is needed on Cygwin is, as explained above, due to strange notions in Windows as to how copy-on-write pages are supposed to work, particularly in the context of making a `MAP_PRIVATE` mmap available to a child process after forking, which means that unfortunately such mmaps must be *copied* into the child process.  Thus if a huge mmap needs to be made for GAP's memory pool, and then we fork the process, that entire mmap (even if much of it has not been written to yet) needs to copied in physical RAM.  The only way to prevent this and keep the footprint of large mmaps small is to use the non-POSIX `MAP_NORESERVE` flag.

There is definitely a bizarre problem when initializing libgap from a process started by Python's `multiprocessing` module.  For example:

```python
>>> import multiprocessing
>>> def foo():
...     from sage.all import libgap
...     print(libgap(1))
>>> p = multiprocessing.Pool(1, maxtasksperchild=1)
>>> p.apply(foo)
1  # eventually
>>> p.apply(foo)  # again
... hangs ...
```

The hang in multiprocessing is due to [this issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue9205) which we already know.  The question is why is the child process dying unexpectedly.  I added some additional debugging to the multiprocessing module and found that it's segfaulting (only the second time, not the first time, and it's a *new* process the second time due to `maxtasksperchild=1`).  The segfault seems to originate from `InitBags` but that's all I can say for now, because even gdb is going haywire on this, which leads me to suspect a bug in Cygwin.

As a matter of fact, there was a [bug in Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2019-01/msg00303.html) fixed very recently (like just a couple weeks ago) that might be relevant to this, but I haven't confirmed.  That is what I am going to check next.

I think the issue may be especially screwy because `multiprocessing.Pool` forks worker processes from within a thread, which technically is fine in principle, but is obviously thorny territory in practice, especially in conjunction with proper exception and signal handling.  The bug that was fixed in Cygwin was in particular to do with exception handling on threads so I do believe it could be related.  One of the tracebacks I managed to get from the segfault in  `InitBags()` even showed:

```

#79 0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()
Backtrace stopped: previous frame inner to this frame (corrupt stack?)
```

which is fishy.

I believe a workaround might be to go ahead and initialize libgap before forking any subprocesses.  Alternatively, just running the docbuild without multiprocessing, at least on Cygwin, is an okay workaround so long as it works.

<a id='comment:25'>Comment 25:</a>
After looking into this a bit more and obtaining some more stack traces, plus taking a look again at the `multiprocessing.pool` sources I see what's going on here:

In my example code in [comment:23](#comment%3A23) the strange thing was that on the first `p.apply(foo)` it works, and then on the second one it segfaults.  The reason for that is simply that `Pool.__init__` directly calls `Pool._repopulate_pool()`, the method which forks off worker processes.

Thus, the N processes created at the time of `Pool.__init__` are all forked directly from the main thread and function normally (in particular with the fix from #27384 in effect).

However, `Pool` then starts up a *thread*, as I mentioned previously, which is responsible for checking for completed worker processes and starting up new ones as needed.  This is when things go awry.  Cygwin supports forking from a thread just fine--perhaps too well in fact, because it successfully duplicates the thread and resumes execution on it in the new process, and this means it's susceptible to the bug I previously mentioned, where Cygwin exception handling wasn't working properly on threads, and in particular meaning that the first time accessing a mmap created with `MAP_NORESERVE` results immediately in an unhandled `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`, which Cysignals' `win32_altstack_handler` takes and exits the process with `exit(-SIGSEGV)` as though an unhandled SIGSEGV occurred.

I'm correct, then Cygwin 3.0.0 should fix that.  I'm trying that next.

In the meantime a workaround is still needed.  I would propose re-introducing the option to build the docs in serial, without using `multiprocessing` at all.  This could be hidden normally much like the doctest runner's `--serial` flag, and on Cygwin use that at least for Cygwin<3.0.0.

Another option we've talked about before is replacing `multiprocessing.Pool` with something else which doesn't require threads, such as a generalization of `sage.doctest.forker`.  I would still like to do that.  But I think in the short-term a simpler hack is needed.  After all, *most* other problems with using multiprocessing here have been otherwise dealt with, it's just this last stupid issue with Cygwin+gap+mmap+fork :(

I think I mentioned the `MAP_NORESERVE` once to gap developers and they were sympathetic; IMHO it should definitely be upstreamed.
