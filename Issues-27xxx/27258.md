<a id='comment:8'></a>Are you sure in all these cases that it's safe to pass `--with-mpfr="$SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX"` when `$SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX` is empty?

I found that a number of packages do not have sensible defaults for `--with-gmp=` passed an empty value, which is why I had to define

```sh
if [ -n "$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX" ]; then
    export SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP="--with-gmp=$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX"
fi
```

And then pass various configure scripts `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP` instead of `--with-gmp=$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`.

Not saying that's always necessary though; might depend on the package and how it handles an empty value for the flag :(

I don't quite understand this. At present AC_SUBSTs are done if `$with_mpfr` is either `system` or `install`. Can it have any other values? If not, the code is already covered everything. If yes, then it's totally unclear how and where to get meaningful values to use in AC_SUBSTs.

A nice syntactic sugar might be to be able to put the `system` case in one `[...]` block, and `[...]` in another (instead of writing an explicit `case` statement).

<a id='comment:60'></a>Volker, we have `u/dimpase/build/mpfr-mpc-ntl`, which is the merged mpfr+mpc - the branch of #27259, also includes this one (#27258), and ntl from #27265.
They are modifying many common files, and should be merged together.
How do we go about it? We can add a configure bump to `u/dimpase/build/mpfr-mpc-ntl`,
after rebasing it appropriately, so that #27258, #27259, and #27265 are all
merged together in one go.

We can open a special ticket for it if you prefer, or deal with it here.
