Are you sure in all these cases that it's safe to pass `--with-mpfr="$SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX"` when `$SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX` is empty?

I found that a number of packages do not have sensible defaults for `--with-gmp=` passed an empty value, which is why I had to define

```sh
if [ -n "$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX" ]; then
    export SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP="--with-gmp=$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX"
fi
```

And then pass various configure scripts `$SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP` instead of `--with-gmp=$SAGE_GMP_PREFIX`.

Not saying that's always necessary though; might depend on the package and how it handles an empty value for the flag :(

On Ubuntu 16.04 I tried `./bootstrap && ./configure`.  On first attempt `mpfr.h` was not detected.  Ok, `apt-get install libmpfr-dev` and tried `./configure` again and it found the headers but failed to find `mpfr_free_pool`.  Apparently the system package (despite the package being named "libmpfr4") is version 3.1.4 of MPFR, so maybe it doesn't have `mpfr_free_pool`?

Why was `mpfr_free_pool` chosen?  Do we have a specific dependency on it?  Or is it possible in principle to use version 3.1.x?  If not then that's fine; if the system package is too old it's too old, so we don't use it.  I'm just curious.

It seems like this would also be able to benefit from #27641.  In this case you would want to add the bits that set

```
AC_SUBST(SAGE_MPFR_INCLUDE, ...)
AC_SUBST(SAGE_MPFR_PREFIX, ...)

in the "POST" argument, since it's something that should *always* be done (the values of those variables would of course still depend on checks performed earlier in the macro).

This would be similar then to the POST argument added for MPIR in #27641.

That's a strong part of what it's for: If we have some `AC_SUBST` variables that will be fed into another template file, such as `sage-env-config.in`, we want to ensure that those substitutions are *always* made by mpfr/spkg-configure.m4 regardless what else was determined w.r.t. MPFR.

I don't quite understand this. At present AC_SUBSTs are done if `$with_mpfr` is either `system` or `install`. Can it have any other values? If not, the code is already covered everything. If yes, then it's totally unclear how and where to get meaningful values to use in AC_SUBSTs.

A nice syntactic sugar might be to be able to put the `system` case in one `[...]` block, and `[...]` in another (instead of writing an explicit `case` statement).

Again, I would just compare with mpir.  In the argument 5 ("POST") it checks `$sage_spkg_install_mpir` (as well as `$sage_spkg_install_gmp`) and sets the values that go in sage-env-config accordingly.

I'll take a try at it.

Perhaps `./bootstrap` should have a remote service to run autoconf ;-)

No, I decided not to--they're not strictly related at all.

I think #27642 will merge cleanly with these other tickets, and still needs more work anyways.

Volker, we have `u/dimpase/build/mpfr-mpc-ntl`, which is the merged mpfr+mpc - the branch of #27259, also includes this one (#27258), and ntl from #27265.
They are modifying many common files, and should be merged together.
How do we go about it? We can add a configure bump to `u/dimpase/build/mpfr-mpc-ntl`,
after rebasing it appropriately, so that #27258, #27259, and #27265 are all
merged together in one go.

We can open a special ticket for it if you prefer, or deal with it here.
