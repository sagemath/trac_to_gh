I think it would simplify an clarify things a bit if sagelib itself were "just another SPKG" like all its dependencies.  It would still be a very important one, but it would still be tracked within the SPKG build system just like any other.  I think this would be a good move toward decoupling sagelib itself from the sage-the-distribution infrastructure.

For now this would mostly require just one small update to the build infrastructure (which I've suggested before) to allow packages to be built from an existing source tree on the filesystem (preferably without copying) rather than from downloading an extracting a tarball.

In the Makefile this would require replacing some references to the phony target `sagelib` to a concrete target `$(inst_sagelib)`.  I think this might also help some issues I've had with build ordering but I'm not positive.

There is a question, in this scenario, about what to do with the Sage docs.  I think they should be a separate SPKG as well (say, `sagedoc`), which would be "optional" but still part of the standard install set by default (a `./configure` flag for this would be useful).  This is in part because the Sage docs are just so big, but also in part because its dependencies are broader than those of `sagelib`, and would actually result in dependency cycles if the docs were just included in the `sagelib` package.  Also, since #25345, it's perfectly possible and valid to build Sage and pass the tests without having built the docs, which could be a time saver for people who just want to build Sage without the docs.
