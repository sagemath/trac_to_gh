In the context of permutation groups, support usually refers to the non fixed points; however, for the symmetric group, the support method is inherited from Coxeter groups and returns which Coxeter generators have been used.

```
sage: S = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: s = S((1,2,3,4));
sage: s
(1,2,3,4)
sage: s.support()
{1, 2, 3}
```

This is just our usual name conflicts between mathematical fields ...

Potential resolution:
- Rename the `support` method to `coxeter_support`
- Deprecate `support` for now
- In one year or so, implement a `support` method for permutation groups with its usual meaning there.
