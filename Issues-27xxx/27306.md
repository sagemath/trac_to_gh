<div id="comment:6" align="right">comment:6</div>

So I have asked there:
https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2278
it is an overflow problem for primes between 2^30 and 2^31.

there is a fix of the giac library here 
https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/changeset/66972/

so we can either patch giac package or put a limitation to 2^30 instead of 2^31 in the function groebner_basis of

src/sage/libs/giac.py

what do you prefer?

Since I do not speak C++ fluently, I do not really understand the "fix", which seems to specify the type of the constant 2 : does this change the result of the comparison to "env" ?

If I understand correctly Bernard Parisse's answer, he plans to fix it someday in the upstream source (but no promises...).

So, in either case, we should be reminded of re-examining the situation (and possibly removing "our" fix) when the relevant part of (upstream) giac changes. In other words, we need a wake-up call...

Changing "our" giac.py sounds simpler (no patch of the upstream source), but will stay applied even when this limitation to integers `<2**30` will cease to be relevant.

OTOH, if/when Bernard changes his source, a patch to the upstream source (more complicated) will no longer apply cleanly ... and we'll get our wake-up call.

Hence my ultimate preference for this solution.

I also update the ticket to `frederichan`'s informal "report upstream" and the informal answer.

The patch is somewhere in `geogebra` source tree. As far as I know, that's not `giac`'s primary source tree.

Furthermore, his answer alludes to a forthcoming validation of (which ?) computation on Groebner bases and (grandiose) plans of using them to compute something called `cyclic10`. All these things are related in his discourse, so I thought he was alluding to (larger) changes in giac's handling of Groebner bases.
