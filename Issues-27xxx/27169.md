This ticket is to upgrade to FreeType 2.9.1.

- **Tarball**: https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/freetype-2.9.1.tar.bz2

Note that downloading from that url works in a browser but not with
`curl -O $URL` which results in a zero byte file. Some redirection must be going on.

Our last upgrade was to FreeType 2.8.1 in #24240
(merged in [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) 8.2.beta0).

This might help with #27163, see comment 27 there.

The `spkg-install` has something about harfbuzz.

Someone knowledgeable should check if that is still needed.

Not sure if this double licensing was already the case when
FreeType was first included as a standard package, and
whether we should update the `SPKG.txt` to mention that.

Yes, I thought I did the harfbuzz thing https://github.com/sagemath/sage/commit/4afa106419b7a603d77bb2c316f776226dd87fc0 

That's from 2015, I am hoping it is fixed but I cannot dig into it right now.

For the license I think we should update `SPKG.txt` as this is relevant for redistribution.

Thanks François for mentioning that the FreeType code repo is mirrored
on GitHub; the main mirror and one such mirror are at:

- http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype
- https://github.com/aseprite/freetype2/

The [FreeType README](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/README)
suggests:

> Please read the `docs/CHANGES` file, it contains IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

>
> Read the files `docs/INSTALL` for installation instructions; see the file
> `docs/LICENSE.TXT` for the available licenses.
>
> The FreeType 2 API reference is located in `docs/reference`; use the file
> `ft2-toc.html` as the top entry point. Additional documentation is available

According to the
[FreeType CHANGES file](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/docs/CHANGES)
(also [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/aseprite/freetype2/blob/master/docs/CHANGES)):

It might be worth going through the other changes listed there.

I feel a little bit out of my depth here, if someone wants to take over.

You can always check what version of freetype you have installed in Sage by calling, at `sage -sh` prompt, `freetype-config  --ftversion`. E.g.

```
$ sage -sh
...
$ freetype-config  --ftversion
2.9.1
```
by the way, no need to post lists of CRAN mirrors---you probably also know
that

```
install.packages('Cairo', repos='https://cran.univ-paris1.fr')
```
would automatically get to the repo of your choice.

Indeed also. But the damn firewall tries to nanny us, which seriously interferes with the availability of a given site, *changing with time*... So I tend to systematically let R search for a suitable repository.

What troubles me more is that ` make` didn't display any error when I recompiled without the proper `freetype` source tarball. It should have complained, no ?

Sage's dependencies resolution is far from ideal. The first thing I'd to to test a new package is to run `./sage -f <package_name>` followed by `make build`.
