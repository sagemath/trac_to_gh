Thanks for remarking that.
Is the current even a good way of doing it?
Maybe I should just have `'ppl'` instead of `None` (but this somehow looks more written in stone, does it)?
In this ticket I didn't want any changes to the default option.

Three little comments from a quick look:

Your `INPUT:` block is over-indented.

It is better to have new-style classes:

```diff
-class Associahedron_class_base():
+class Associahedron_class_base(object):
```

```diff
-class Associahedra_base:
+class Associahedra_base(object):
```

I do not see why the `_poly_super` is needed. You could just look at the MRO or have the `Polyhedra_*` class be a class-level attribute (similar to `Element`). Are you also sure that this doesn't work:

```
associahedron = super(self, Associahedra_base)._element_constructor_(None, [inequalities, []])
```
as my understanding is that it goes to the next class up in the MRO after `Associahedra_base`, which should be the `Polyhedra_*` class.

> {{{

(with self and Associahedra_base interchanged) lead to

```
TypeError: super() argument 1 must be type, not classobj
```
However, this seems to be solved by inheriting from `object`.

JP asked me to also fix #25183. So I did.

When a polyhedral face of an associahedron is constructed, I need to somehow make sure that `__new__` does not return a child of `Associahedron_base` (when the argument `cartan_type` is missing). This is the solution I came up with.

I have no clue how to use `Parent.element_class`.

Add the period at the end of the sentence.

Why is the only allowed base ring `QQ`? Am I missing something?

A semicolon would probably fit better.
I learnt that INPUT does not stop with period.

As for the flow polytope, one can add an argument `base_ring` later.

As for the Associahedron, one would need one class for each combination of `base_ring` and `backend` (for each child of `Polyhedron_base`).
Is it worth it?
I don't see a great need for a different base ring.
(Contrary, constructing an associahedron with normaliz right away, saves a lot of time.)

Anyway, the goal of this ticket was to add a backend option.
So I never minded the base ring.

Okay, I am pretty sure you now break `Associahedra` when the backend is not specified. I also do not see why you need this in `Associahedron`:

```
    if backend is None:
        backend = 'ppl'
```
Just set `backend='ppl'` as the default argument instead of `None`.
You should also update the documentation there too:

```
    - ``backend`` -- string (``'ppl'``); the backend to use;
      see :meth:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor.Polyhedron`
```

Also, in `flow_polytope`:

```
        - ``backend`` -- string or ``None`` (default); the backend to use;
          see :meth:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor.Polyhedron`
```

(By convention in Sage, the `INPUT:` block points are not considered to be full sentences, so no period/full-stop.)

We had the discussion before. I guess its fine now, as we got rid of the complete sentences.

Btw, in many (if not all) polytopes in the library the `INPUT:` block is a complete sentence with period/full-stop.
