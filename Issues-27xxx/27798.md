Thanks for remarking that.

Maybe I should just have `'ppl'` instead of `None` (but this somehow looks more written in stone, does it)?
In this ticket I didn't want any changes to the default option.

Three little comments from a quick look:

Your `INPUT:` block is over-indented.

It is better to have new-style classes:

```diff
-class Associahedron_class_base():
+class Associahedron_class_base(object):
```

```diff
-class Associahedra_base:
+class Associahedra_base(object):
```

I do not see why the `_poly_super` is needed. You could just look at the MRO or have the `Polyhedra_*` class be a class-level attribute (similar to `Element`). Are you also sure that this doesn't work:

```
associahedron = super(self, Associahedra_base)._element_constructor_(None, [inequalities, []])
```
as my understanding is that it goes to the next class up in the MRO after `Associahedra_base`, which should be the `Polyhedra_*` class.

(with self and Associahedra_base interchanged) lead to

```
TypeError: super() argument 1 must be type, not classobj
```
However, this seems to be solved by inheriting from `object`.

JP asked me to also fix #25183. So I did.

When a polyhedral face of an associahedron is constructed, I need to somehow make sure that `__new__` does not return a child of `Associahedron_base` (when the argument `cartan_type` is missing). This is the solution I came up with.

I have no clue how to use `Parent.element_class`.

I misunderstood. From my understanding #25183 should be fixed with redefining `__new__` or with changing the construction of `as_polyhedron`.

Either way, I think initialization of associahedron should ask for `cartan_type`, as an argument. From my understanding an object should be valid upon construction.

Anyway, I could move my suggestions for #25183 to a new branch public/25183 as a suggestion for this (other) ticket. Then this (this) ticket would be cleaned up from this discussion.

Add the period at the end of the sentence.

Why is the only allowed base ring `QQ`? Am I missing something?

A semicolon would probably fit better.
I learnt that INPUT does not stop with period.

As for the flow polytope, one can add an argument `base_ring` later.

As for the Associahedron, one would need one class for each combination of `base_ring` and `backend` (for each child of `Polyhedron_base`).
Is it worth it?
I don't see a great need for a different base ring.
(Contrary, constructing an associahedron with normaliz right away, saves a lot of time.)

Anyway, the goal of this ticket was to add a backend option.
So I never minded the base ring.

That's correct. In this case, it is a sentence with a noun, a verb and and complement. Thus it requires a period. Usually it is not a sentence.......................

It seems like you have some extra stuff in `digraph` that has snuck in with the `all_paths_iterator`.

Okay, I am pretty sure you now break `Associahedra` when the backend is not specified. I also do not see why you need this in `Associahedron`:

```
    if backend is None:
        backend = 'ppl'
```
Just set `backend='ppl'` as the default argument instead of `None`.
You should also update the documentation there too:

```
    - ``backend`` -- string (``'ppl'``); the backend to use;
      see :meth:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor.Polyhedron`
```

Also, in `flow_polytope`:

```
        - ``backend`` -- string or ``None`` (default); the backend to use;
          see :meth:`sage.geometry.polyhedron.constructor.Polyhedron`
```

(By convention in Sage, the `INPUT:` block points are not considered to be full sentences, so no period/full-stop.)

We had the discussion before. I guess its fine now, as we got rid of the complete sentences.

Btw, in many (if not all) polytopes in the library the `INPUT:` block is a complete sentence with period/full-stop.
