The file explain_pickle has currently 70 failing doctests with python3. It seems to be very difficult to fix them all.

Proposal:

* either (1) remove this file completely
* or (2) tag all doctests with `#py2`

This ticket implements option (2): tag all doctests with `#py2`.

Further work on `explain_pickle` is tracked at #27350.

I had assumed keep `sage.misc.explain_pickle` but just have it do `from explain_pickle import *` and also raise a deprecation warning if imported.

This will have to wait, of course, until I make `explain_pickle`, and we can add it either as a standard package, or an optional package (in which case `sage.misc.explain_pickle` should catch `ImportError` and provide some explanation).

I promise I will soon (although I don't consider it high priority even for the Python 3 port, but I know you want to get those failures down--though this would be a good use case for known-failures :)\n\nI fear you did some work here that was ultimately unnecessary.  In particular, I believe the `unpickle_newobj` utility doesn't even belong in explain_pickle in the first place; it should be moved elsewhere.\n\nSecond of all, I had still planned to keep the `sage.misc.explain_pickle` module as a wrapper--possibly with parts of it deprecated, but also possibly not; it depends on exactly how the third-party `explain_pickle` module ends up being structured.

Please just let me take care of it.  I promise I will soon (although I don't consider it high priority even for the Python 3 port, but I know you want to get those failures down--though this would be a good use case for known-failures :)

I fear you did some work here that was ultimately unnecessary.  In particular, I believe the `unpickle_newobj` utility doesn't even belong in explain_pickle in the first place; it should be moved elsewhere.

Second of all, I had still planned to keep the `sage.misc.explain_pickle` module as a wrapper--possibly with parts of it deprecated, but also possibly not; it depends on exactly how the third-party `explain_pickle` module ends up being structured.  For example, there's lots of use currently of Sage-specific stuff like `SageInputExpression` and `SageInputBuilder` that doesn't necessarily make sense to use (at least directly) in a more generic implementation.  But it will definitely have an API that will allow using them, but that might involve extensions that would still belong somewhere in sage, such as in the existing explain_pickle module.

So it's not just a simple matter of removing that module and declaring tests that happened to use it as optional, and there's not much point in doing work on this until I have that third-party module ready to work with.

Thanks, Erik. I understand very well the existence of "other priorities".

I am proposing now a simple branch, where I just tag `#py2` the failing doctests. This will allow to put this aside, and it will no longer stand in the middle of the way to python3-full-tests-pass.
