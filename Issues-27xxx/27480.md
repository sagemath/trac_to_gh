Page Rank computes the ranking of the nodes of the graph based on the structure of the incoming links. It is a useful metrics in graphs and can be quite useful. (https://towardsdatascience.com/graphs-and-paths-pagerank-54f180a1aa0a)

Below is a link to a thesis on this algorithm 
http://www.sagemath.org/files/thesis/augeri-thesis-2008.pdf

It would be good to have its implementation in the Sage's graph module.

networkx has several methods to compute Page rank: a pure Python, one using numpy, another using scipy, etc.

The optional package `igraph` also has an implementation of pagerank (see
[igraph documentation for pagerank](https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#pagerank)
(to install igraph, do `sage -i igraph` and `sage -i python_igraph`).

The best thing to do is to create a method including a parameter `algorithm`, and that will call the different algorithms. So `algorithm` could be `None``, `'networkx'`, `'numpy'`, `'scipy'`, `'igraph'`.

I have installed igraph in my sage module. But however its pagerank algorithm is not able to work. It keeps on throwing a segmentation error. I use igraph_graph to convert sage graph into igraph. All other algorithms of igraph works fine. Following error message I get:

```
Cython backtrace
----------------

29	../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/waitpid.c: No such file or directory.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 56, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/Cython/Debugger/libcython.py", line 689, in invoke

TypeError: argument 1 must be str, not bytes
Saved trace to /home/rajat/.sage/crash_logs/crash_yLpPiW.log
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.

```


Regarding networkx,numpy and scipy, I have tested them on their runtime. Numpy does it by matrix multiplication and solving for eigenvalues, networkx has pure python implementation and scipy does matrix multiplication iteratively.

Following are the runtimes I got:


```

sage: %timeit nx.pagerank_scipy(G)
100 loops, best of 3: 3.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit nx.pagerank(G)
10 loops, best of 3: 53.2 ms per loop

sage: G=nx.gnp_random_graph(4000,0.01,directed=True)
sage: %timeit nx.pagerank(G)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.81 s per loop
sage: %timeit nx.pagerank_scipy(G)
1 loop, best of 3: 206 ms per loop
sage: %timeit nx.pagerank_numpy(G)
1 loop, best of 3: 1min 1s per loop

```


As per my analysis upto around 60 vertices numpy is fast but scipy is fastest after that.

I think that this is an issue on igraph side that its not able to work for weighted graphs in python.
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/igraph-help/2008-08/msg00030.html

Still I am seeing through how the code of igraph can be fixed to take weights in pagerank.
Else we can use other libraries like scipy for weighted case.

I think the problem is with the version or codebase of igraph which sage currently uses , maybe its not been updated.

Using sage:

```
sage: G = Graph(5)
sage: I = G.igraph_graph()
sage: I.add_edge(0,1,weight=50)
igraph.Edge(<igraph.Graph object at 0x7fe144ca7a00>, 0, {'weight': 50})
sage: I.add_edge(1,2,weight=70)
....: 
igraph.Edge(<igraph.Graph object at 0x7fe144ca7a00>, 1, {'weight': 70})
sage: I.add_edge(2,4,weight=35)
igraph.Edge(<igraph.Graph object at 0x7fe144ca7a00>, 2, {'weight': 35})
sage: 
....: 
sage: I.add_edge(3,4,weight=35)
igraph.Edge(<igraph.Graph object at 0x7fe144ca7a00>, 3, {'weight': 35})
sage: I.pagerank()
[0.134527027027027,
 0.24594594594594593,
 0.23905405405405405,
 0.134527027027027,
 0.24594594594594593]
sage: I.pagerank(weights='weight')
[0.134527027027027,
 0.24594594594594593,
 0.23905405405405405,
 0.134527027027027,
 0.24594594594594593]

```

Using python terminal

```
>>> I = Graph(5)
>>> I
<igraph.Graph object at 0x7f5bcd250528>
>>> I.summary()
'IGRAPH U--- 5 0 -- '
>>> I.add_edge(0,1,weight=50)

Sage 8.8.beta0 has been released and it includes the 2 tickets marked as dependencies. So you can update you develop branch and rebuild this ticket using last beta.

If it is not possible to use weight with igraph, add a TODO block in the method to say that it should be done someday.

Yes other algorithms like dijkstra are working fine with weights. I think its an old bug of igraph which is updated as can be seen by the results in my python shell however its not been updated in sage version of igraph.

- Unfortunately, igraph is an optional package, so you can use it only if installed. See e.g. `clique_maximum` to know how to check if a package is installed.

- Also, I suggest you start checking if default should be used, and then select most suitable default algorithm.

- instead of `implementation`, you should use `algorithm`.

- You should raise an error if the given name is unknown

- the name of igraph is `igraph`, so don't use `Igraph`. In fact, you could do `algorithm = algorithm.lower()` to avoid errors.

- `if self.order() == 0:` -> `if not self.order():`

- this is not needed `import igraph`

- We usually use `vertex/vertices` and not `node/nodes`.

- 

```diff
-        Return the PageRank of the nodes in the graph.
+        Return the PageRank of the vertices of ``self``.
```

- This text might be more informative.

```diff
-        PageRank calculates the ranking of nodes in the graph G based on the
-        structure of the incoming links. It is popularly used to rank web
-        pages.
+        PageRank is a centrality measure first used to rank web pages.
+        The PageRank algorithm outputs the probability distribution that
+        a random walker in the graph visits a vertex.
```

- for the default case, the simpler version is:

```
+        if algorithm:
+            algorithm = algorithm.lower()
+        elif self.order <= 60:
+            algorithm = 'numpy'
+        else:
+            algorithm = 'scipy'
```

optimizing the code for computing pagerank for connected components subgraph will work for undirected graphs as we can easily find the normalization factor but for digraphs the nodes can be dangling also in such a case we randomly connect that node to other nodes in our graph with some weight value of the edge. In such cases this optimization may not be desired.

Even for undirected graphs with personalization parameter set the optimization may not work as can be seen from example below:

```
sage: g = Graph([(1,2,3),(2,3,5),(3,5,8),(2,5,13),(2,4,25)])
sage: personalization={}
sage: personalization[1] = 8
sage: personalization[2] = 16
sage: personalization[3] = 24
sage: personalization[4] = 36
sage: personalization[5] = 25
sage: g.pagerank(by_weight=True, personalization=personalization)
sage: personalization2={}
sage: personalization2[1] = 84
sage: personalization2[2] = 42
sage: personalization2[3] = 30
sage: personalization2[4] = 70
sage: f = Graph([(1,2,2),(2,3,15),(2,4,22)])
sage: f.pagerank(by_weight=True,personalization=personalization2)
{1: 0.07643670757326188,
 2: 0.474528450109004,
 3: 0.17504521830388875,
 4: 0.27398962401384513}
sage: q = g + f
sage: personalization[0] = 8
sage: personalization[1] = 16
sage: personalization[2] = 24
sage: personalization[3] = 36
sage: personalization[4] = 25
sage: personalization[5] = 84
sage: personalization[6] = 42
sage: personalization[7] = 30
sage: personalization[8] = 70
sage: q.pagerank(by_weight=True,personalization=personalization)
{0: 0.010763853970772248,
 1: 0.12955307566026533,
 2: 0.04384414464203576,
 3: 0.07596743980618663,
 4: 0.0652489170000004,
 5: 0.05156608491296348,
 6: 0.3201286892373546,
 7: 0.11808892042931564,
 8: 0.18483887434110574}
```

So I guess its best to keep the method as it is for now.

- no capital letter after `;`. So 

```diff
-        - ``alpha`` -- float (default: ``0.85``); Damping parameter for
+        - ``alpha`` -- float (default: ``0.85``); damping parameter for
```

- you should give slightly more details on what the parameters are. For instance, the PageRank value for vertices without in-neighbors is `1 - damping`. Furthermore, the `damping` factor (this term is better than parameter here) is the probability of resetting the random walk to a uniform distribution in each step.

- As reported by the patchbot. Please check it

```diff
-        .. SEEALSO:
+        .. SEEALSO::
```

- ...

```diff
-        elif self.order <= 60:
+        elif self.order() <= 60:
```

- simplify code and avoid using `.vertices()` when not necessary (it sorts vertices)

```diff
-            if by_weight:
-                I = self.igraph_graph(edge_attrs={'weight': [weight_function(e)
-                                                  for e in self.edge_iterator()]})
-                page_rank = I.pagerank(damping=alpha, weights='weight')
-                return {v: page_rank[i] for i, v in enumerate(self.vertices())}
-            else:
-                I = self.igraph_graph()
-                page_rank = I.pagerank(damping=alpha)
-                return {v: page_rank[i] for i, v in enumerate(self.vertices())}
+            if by_weight:
+                I = self.igraph_graph(edge_attrs={'weight': [weight_function(e)
+                                                  for e in self.edge_iterator()]})
+            else:
+                I = self.igraph_graph()
+            page_rank = I.pagerank(damping=alpha, weights=weight)
+            return {v: page_rank[i] for i, v in enumerate(self)}
```

- Don't start error message with a capital letter `raise NotImplementedError("Only 'NetworkX', 'Numpy', 'Scipy', and 'igraph' are supported")`

The documentation requires further improvements. I know that the documentations of networkx/igraph are not very clear, but we can do better.


- I don't understand what the `personalization` parameter is used for. We can at least clarify the text and be closer to what is explained in [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank.html#networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank)

-          vector" consisting of a dictionary with a key for every graph node
-          and nonzero personalization value for each node.

+          By default (``None``), a uniform distribution is used.
```

- if you understand what is `dangling`, please improve the description.

- You should indicate the parameters that cannot be used with an algorithm or that can only be used with an algorithm.

- may be it would be better to start the list of parameters with the algorithms ? Well, think about it.

- the note `Note that ``'networkx'`` does not support multigraphs.` could be added directly with the in the line `- ``NetworkX`` -- `...


- you could add a `TESTS` block with errors, specific cases, etc. For instance with `personalization={0: 1, 1: -1}`

Also, note that using a graph like a 4-cycle is interesting to illustrate the effect of the various parameters. Indeed, the pagerank of each vertex is 0.25.
  Note that the example you have is also interesting as it shows that the result is slightly different from an algorithm to another.

<a id='comment:74'>Comment 74:</a>
This is numerical noise due to floating point arithmetic. See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#special-markup-to-influence-doctests

A solution is to add `# abs tol 1e-9` to all doctests.

```diff
-            sage: G.pagerank(algorithm="Numpy")
+            sage: G.pagerank(algorithm="Numpy") # abs tol 1e-9
```
...

```diff
-            sage: G.pagerank()
+            sage: G.pagerank() # abs tol 1e-9
```
also for `igraph`

```diff
-            sage: G.pagerank(alpha=0.50, algorithm="igraph")  # optional - python_igraph
+            sage: G.pagerank(alpha=0.50, algorithm="igraph") # optional - python_igraph # abs tol 1e-9
```
