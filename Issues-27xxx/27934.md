The current method to find the `radius` and the `diameter` of the graph calculates the `eccentricity` of the graph and them takes the `minimum` and `maximum` of all the eccentricities.

The method I have implemented here calculates the **vertex with minimum eccentricity** without computing the complete eccentricity of the graph. This information, along with the partially computed eccentricities of other nodes, acts as a `certificate` to find the radius and the diameter of the graph.

I am yet to implement the algorithm for the diameter.

The algorithm might look like a heuristic one (especially with the while loop). But the paper guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. I have referred to this paper for the algorithm:

I have gone through a few of the recent papers, and I found this paper having pretty good results.

I don't recognize the algorithms in ​https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660 in your code. For instance, I don't see in the paper a loop like `for _ in range(5):`.


general remarks:
- why using numpy ?
- your code is not documented
- you must add doctests

Oh sorry. I had done that for debugging purpose. It should have been a `repeat` loop.

I felt like I could gain a little more speed when using `numpy` methods (like element-wise minimum values between two arrays).



> you must add doctests

>

I thought of doing this after implementing all the algorithms. I will be changing the functions (arguments, return values, etc.) depending on the callee methods, so I thought it'd be better to document it after implementing all the related algorithms.

And can I get a few examples of large graphs so that I can check the performance of my algorithm?

After exposing in eccentricity method, following unexpected behavior happens.I tried printing the values, there are lot of garbage values, some eccentricity are even 0.
this happens for many other graphs too.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: G.eccentricity() == eccentricity(G, algorithm='DHV')
False
```

I figured out my mistake. I was using `MemoryAllocator` for memory allocation and it was freeing all the memory on returing from function.

Checked it. No problem.

Noted

One thing, I would like to mention. I haven't added reference [Dragan2018]_ in rst file. As we have added reference in #29715.
Do we need to add it here too?

Rest all looks good to me

One thing, that we missed was we were only popping from active while updating lower bounds. So, I have fixed that.

Taking the above idea, I had done similar modification in unweighted version. Benefit of this modification is overall consistency and one less loop. Although there is slight reduction in simplicity of code, but in my opinion its not that much.\\

What are your opinion on this, shall we keep it or revert to previous version?
