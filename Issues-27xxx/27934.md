The current method to find the `radius` and the `diameter` of the graph calculates the `eccentricity` of the graph and them takes the `minimum` and `maximum` of all the eccentricities.

The method I have implemented here calculates the **vertex with minimum eccentricity** without computing the complete eccentricity of the graph. This information, along with the partially computed eccentricities of other nodes, acts as a `certificate` to find the radius and the diameter of the graph.

I am yet to implement the algorithm for the diameter.

I don't recognize the algorithms in ​https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660 in your code. For instance, I don't see in the paper a loop like `for _ in range(5):`.


general remarks:
- why using numpy ?
- your code is not documented
- you must add doctests

Oh sorry. I had done that for debugging purpose. It should have been a `repeat` loop.



> why using numpy ?

>

I felt like I could gain a little more speed when using `numpy` methods (like element-wise minimum values between two arrays).



> you must add doctests

>

I thought of doing this after implementing all the algorithms. I will be changing the functions (arguments, return values, etc.) depending on the callee methods, so I thought it'd be better to document it after implementing all the related algorithms.

And can I get a few examples of large graphs so that I can check the performance of my algorithm?

Code and algorithms: If you don't put enough details in the code, I cannot review it. It must be clear enough.

Performances: You can try with a 100x100 2D-grid, a large random Barabasi Albert graph, etc. In particular, compare the running time with existing implementation for undirected graphs.

After exposing in eccentricity method, following unexpected behavior happens.I tried printing the values, there are lot of garbage values, some eccentricity are even 0.
this happens for many other graphs too.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: G.eccentricity() == eccentricity(G, algorithm='DHV')
False
```

Noted

One thing, I would like to mention. I haven't added reference [Dragan2018]_ in rst file. As we have added reference in #29715.
Do we need to add it here too?

Rest all looks good to me

One thing, that we missed was we were only popping from active while updating lower bounds. So, I have fixed that.

Taking the above idea, I had done similar modification in unweighted version. Benefit of this modification is overall consistency and one less loop. Although there is slight reduction in simplicity of code, but in my opinion its not that much.\\

What are your opinion on this, shall we keep it or revert to previous version?
