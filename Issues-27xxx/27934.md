The current method to find the `radius` and the `diameter` of the graph calculates the `eccentricity` of the graph and them takes the `minimum` and `maximum` of all the eccentricities.

The method I have implemented here calculates the **vertex with minimum eccentricity** without computing the complete eccentricity of the graph. This information, along with the partially computed eccentricities of other nodes, acts as a `certificate` to find the radius and the diameter of the graph.

I am yet to implement the algorithm for the diameter.

I don't recognize the algorithms in ​https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660 in your code. For instance, I don't see in the paper a loop like `for _ in range(5):`.


general remarks:
- why using numpy ?
- your code is not documented
- you must add doctests

I thought of doing this after implementing all the algorithms. I will be changing the functions (arguments, return values, etc.) depending on the callee methods, so I thought it'd be better to document it after implementing all the related algorithms.

And can I get a few examples of large graphs so that I can check the performance of my algorithm?

Before exposing in method eccentricity :- [https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/3763266aa13d3e637292e2091c360a670bf441bf](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/3763266aa13d3e637292e2091c360a670bf441bf) or comment 20.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import all_eccentricity_DHV
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: G.eccentricity() == all_eccentricity_DHV(G)
True

comment 21 or [https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6529e6f8281aba63143d17e211b93abe7aa1713e](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/6529e6f8281aba63143d17e211b93abe7aa1713e)//

After exposing in eccentricity method, following unexpected behavior happens.I tried printing the values, there are lot of garbage values, some eccentricity are even 0.
this happens for many other graphs too.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: G.eccentricity() == eccentricity(G, algorithm='DHV')
False
```

Checked it. No problem.

Noted

One thing, I would like to mention. I haven't added reference [Dragan2018]_ in rst file. As we have added reference in #29715.
Do we need to add it here too?

Rest all looks good to me

One thing, that we missed was we were only popping from active while updating lower bounds. So, I have fixed that.

Taking the above idea, I had done similar modification in unweighted version. Benefit of this modification is overall consistency and one less loop. Although there is slight reduction in simplicity of code, but in my opinion its not that much.\\

What are your opinion on this, shall we keep it or revert to previous version?
