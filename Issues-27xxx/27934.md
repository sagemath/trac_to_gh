<a id='comment:4'></a>The current method to find the `radius` and the `diameter` of the graph calculates the `eccentricity` of the graph and them takes the `minimum` and `maximum` of all the eccentricities.

The method I have implemented here calculates the **vertex with minimum eccentricity** without computing the complete eccentricity of the graph. This information, along with the partially computed eccentricities of other nodes, acts as a `certificate` to find the radius and the diameter of the graph.

I am yet to implement the algorithm for the diameter.

And can I get a few examples of large graphs so that I can check the performance of my algorithm?

After exposing in eccentricity method, following unexpected behavior happens.I tried printing the values, there are lot of garbage values, some eccentricity are even 0.
this happens for many other graphs too.

sage: from sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs import eccentricity
sage: G = graphs.FoldedCubeGraph(13)
sage: G.eccentricity() == eccentricity(G, algorithm='DHV')

One thing, I would like to mention. I haven't added reference [Dragan2018]_ in rst file. As we have added reference in #29715.
Do we need to add it here too?

One thing, that we missed was we were only popping from active while updating lower bounds. So, I have fixed that.

Taking the above idea, I had done similar modification in unweighted version. Benefit of this modification is overall consistency and one less loop. Although there is slight reduction in simplicity of code, but in my opinion its not that much.\\

What are your opinion on this, shall we keep it or revert to previous version?
