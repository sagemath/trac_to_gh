Thanks for checking.  I think I can see why -- there is a better version in modular_parametrization.py in the method map_to_complex_numbers() which takes a bit precision 'prec' parameter and works out the number of terms (quoting my code in eclib for that!).

Compare

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: E.eval_modular_form(1+I, 100)
[0.0018604485340371083710285594393397945456]
```
with

```
sage: E.modular_parametrization().map_to_complex_numbers(1+I,100)
0.0018639488830113800896666432794 - 6.3094713246691959525967229233e-34*I
```

where the parameter 100 in the last call is bit precision.  It would be reasonable to deprecate the function we have been talking about and/or replace its implementation with a call to the modular_parametrization one.
