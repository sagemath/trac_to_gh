No!  The examples for eval_modular_form() are stupid (before and after).  The badly-named prec parameter is not a floating point precision, but should be a positive integer since (looking at the code) it says how many terms of the q-expansion to use.  For the example a value of 100 would be reasonable. No wonder the "values" at the three points are 0, since 0 terms of the series have been added!

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: E.eval_modular_form([1.5+I,2.0+I,2.5+I],100)
[-0.0018743978548152085771342944989052703431,
 0.0018604485340371083710285594393397945456,
 -0.0018743978548152085771342944989052703431]
```

is reasonable.  Even 10 gives the same result.  (Convergence depends on the size of the imaginary part, and these points have imaginary part 1.)

Thanks for checking.  I think I can see why -- there is a better version in modular_parametrization.py in the method map_to_complex_numbers() which takes a bit precision 'prec' parameter and works out the number of terms (quoting my code in eclib for that!).

Compare

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve('37a1')
sage: E.eval_modular_form(1+I, 100)
[0.0018604485340371083710285594393397945456]
```
with

```
sage: E.modular_parametrization().map_to_complex_numbers(1+I,100)
0.0018639488830113800896666432794 - 6.3094713246691959525967229233e-34*I
```

where the parameter 100 in the last call is bit precision.  It would be reasonable to deprecate the function we have been talking about and/or replace its implementation with a call to the modular_parametrization one.
