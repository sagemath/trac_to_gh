I'd like to "remove squares" in some polynomials living in a polynomial ring over `QQ`, in 2 variables: `x`,`y`. I tried to implement this by modding out by the ideal `(x^2 - x, y^2 - y)`. Depending on the ordering, the result of `.mod()` does not always output the polynomial I am looking for. 

Without specifying an ordering, everything seems fine:

```python
sage: R1.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: I1 = R1.ideal(["x^2 - x", "y^2 - y"])
sage: R1("x^2 + y").mod(I1)
x + y
sage: R1("x + y^2").mod(I1)
x + y
```

However, when specifying the order `lex` the reduction of `x + y^2` is not as expected:

```python
sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lex")
sage: I2 = R2.ideal(["x^2 - x", "y^2 - y"])
sage: R2("x^2 + y").mod(I2)
x + y
sage: R2("x + y^2").mod(I2)
x + y^2
```

This issue was reported in [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/80Scc9pTkPM) where it was pointed out that it is likely a bug in Singular, or in the Singular interface to Sage.

In particular, using the order `lex` works when `implementation="generic"` is also specified:

```python
sage: R3.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lex", implementation="generic")
sage: I3 = R3.ideal(["x^2 - x", "y^2 - y"])
sage: R3("x^2 + y").mod(I3)
x + y
sage: R3("x + y^2").mod(I3)
x + y
```

For reference, I am using Sage version 8.6 on macOS Mojave 10.14.3.

Singular understand option `"lp"` for the lexicographic order.
See https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-3/sing_31.htm#SEC43

And if I define `R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lp")`
then it all works as expect. So the bug is in translating the Sage's option `"lex"` into Singular's one, should be easy to fix.

This bug is already in Sage 8.1, that's as far back as I went.
Perhaps it was always there, I don't know.

Broken lex order should be a blocker, I think...

If a bug is that old and nobody noticed before, then surely it's not serious enough to warrant blocker status? But I'll let the release manager judge that.

What do you mean with "still works"? At the places where `order_dict` is used, a default value of `ringorder_dp` is used, so if `lp` is not a key in the dict anymore, I would expect that you end up with `dp` instead.

No, an unknown value of `order` leads to error:

I suspect it is easy to fix, as it's some sort of translation issue between orders of Sage and orders of Singular, and people who wrote it are reading this ticket, I gather.

Please, please, do something, it is **very serious**, a broken Groebner basis for lex order is  really a blocker.

If the bug is already in Sage 8.1, Sage 8.2, Sage 8.3, Sage 8.4, Sage 8.5 and Sage 8.6, would it really make such a big difference to have the same bug also in Sage 8.7?

Ultimately the normal form computation occurs in the code starting from line 283 in `src/sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy.pyx`

More about the bug: it appears that only the 1st term is reduced:

```
sage: R2.<y,z,t,x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 4, order="lex")
....: I2 = R2.ideal([x^2 + x, y^2 +2*y, z^2 - z, t^2 - t])
....: p = x^2 + y^2+z^2+t^2; p.mod(I2)
....: 
-2*y + z^2 + t^2 + x^2
sage: I2.reduce(p)
-2*y + z^2 + t^2 + x^2
```
(similarly with 3 variables...)

Now, reading code tells me that `p.mod(I2)` does `I2.reduce(p)`
which in turn tries the strat thing, which "works":

```
        try:
            strat = self._groebner_strategy()
            return strat.normal_form(f)
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError, ValueError):
            pass
```
and gets the wrong answer. If it didn't work then it'd try to reduce using an explicit Groebner basis for `I2`, something that gives a correct answer:

```
sage: p.reduce(I2.groebner_basis())
-2*y + z + t - x
```

So indeed it's that `strat` thing. Note that if I specify `order="lp"` then calling `_groebner_strategy()` fails, and the result is (correctly) computed reducing with the Groebner basis.

We don't really promise anywhere to do tail reduction I think; Singular does the right thing by default but also not necessarily:

```

// ** redefining r (ring r=0,(x,y),lp;)

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A19):
> We don't really promise anywhere to do tail reduction I think; 

yes we do:

```
age: I2.reduce?
Signature:      I2.reduce(f)
Docstring:     
   Reduce an element modulo the reduced Groebner basis for this ideal.
   This returns 0 if and only if the element is in this ideal. In any
   case, this reduction is unique up to monomial orders.
```
and here we see different reductions depending upon the chosen implementation for the ring, nothing one can call "unique up to monomial orders".
(the default implementation gives one result, the generic one gives another result).

Perhaps Sage should allow for not doing the tail reduction, but it must not be the default in any case (it's not the default in Singular, the optional 3rd argument in `reduce` is by default 0 in Singular)

Replying to [@dimpase](#comment%3A17):
> please also see [comment:16](#comment%3A16) about this - no, at no point here the "internal" Singular's order becomes `dp`.

I looked at [comment:16](#comment%3A16) and I don't see a conclusive argument there that checks that the internal libsingular ring does *not* have `dp` as its ordering. In [singular_ring_new](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9db4320e485ed0aeae56d2c9dfc91fabe14659b1/src/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx#L180) we see that the singular termorder string is looked up from the `term_order.singular_str()` attribute. That's what's used as key into the `order_dict` dictionary, with [order_dict.get(s, ringorder_dp)](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9db4320e485ed0aeae56d2c9dfc91fabe14659b1/src/sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx#L189), so if a key is not found then you end up with `dp` as ordering. We have:

```
sage: R1.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: R1.term_order().singular_str()
'dp'
sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lex")
sage: R2.term_order().singular_str()
'lp'
sage: R3.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lp")
sage: R3.term_order().singular_str()
'lp'
```
so changing "lp" as a key in `order_dict` to "lex" would result in all three of these resulting into a libsingular ring with `dp` as ordering; where we are not observing failure of tail reduction on the examples we're trying.

It's a little strange that `lp` is also accepted as ordering, since that is not a value that Sage really knows how to work with otherwise. That explicitly coded, however: [if name not in print_name_mapping.keys() and name not in singular_name_mapping.values()](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/9db4320e485ed0aeae56d2c9dfc91fabe14659b1/src/sage/rings/polynomial/term_order.py#L730) (that's why "baz" is not accepted as a term order and "lp" is)

So the way I read the code is that the currently proposed modification maps both degrevlex and lex (and also "lp") to `ringorder_dp` in libsingular.

We should probably be using examples where "lex" and "degrevlex" give different normal forms (and hopefully also different tailreduction results). I'm pretty sure the real problem is *not* in `order_dict`.

It seems that Volker might be right about the real problem: the tail is not rewritten fully simply because due to Singular's options in place when Singular's `redtailBba` function is called in `normal_form()`.
It's undocumented code in Singular, and Sage's interface to it dates back to 2009. Perhaps `malb` can comment on it...

Beware, the `._singular_()` code has to do with the Singular *interface*. Whatever it does is quite independent of `libsingular`. If you want to know what `libsingular` is doing, you have to query *it*. The design of `libsingular` doesn't make it particularly easy to dig up stuff about it interactively.

Doesn't that simply revert back to "dp"? `_order[idx] = order_dict.get(s, ringorder_dp)`

no, sorry, this actually just breaks the creation of the strategy thing completely, and resorts to reducing using an explicitly computed Groebner basis,

Which version of `redtailBba()` do you call?
In `kutil.h` one  sees 

```
KINLINE poly redtailBba (poly p,int end_pos,kStrategy strat,
       BOOLEAN normalize=FALSE);
poly redtailBba (LObject *L, int end_pos,kStrategy strat,
               BOOLEAN withT = FALSE,BOOLEAN normalize=FALSE);
poly redtailBba (TObject *T, int end_pos,kStrategy strat);
```
so that `normalize=FALSE` (and mysteriously named `withT = FALSE`) suggests 
you might be calling with these defaults.

The call is `_p = redtailBba(_p, max_ind, self._strat)`
with `cdef poly *_p`, so it might be it picks up the 2nd prototype, with these defaults...

What I don't understand is why `self._strat.noTailReduction = False` is needed explicitly,
isn't the `False` value the default result of the initialisation of the class?

Or is it implementation-dependent?

Already creating a ring with `lex` term ordering option flips this option:

```
sage: from sage.libs.singular.option import LibSingularOptions
sage: LibSingularOptions()["redTail"]
True
sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lex")
sage: LibSingularOptions()["redTail"]
False
```

in fact, I saw the following comment in `kernel/GBEngine/kutil.cc`:

```
/* alway use tailreduction, except:
  * - in local rings, - in lex order case, -in ring over extensions */
```

Thus, `lex` is special...

It doesn't look like github issues are a regular discussion forum for Singular issues, so you might want to send it elsewhere.

I can imagine that particularly for lex, tail reduction might be more expensive (e.g., there's generally an infinite number of monomials smaller than the leading one, so it's harder to bound the process). So there might be something to say for amending the documentation of `reduce` to allow for non-tailreduced outcomes and allowing for an option to set whether tailreduction is required or not.

in my experience, it's a place where one of the authors of sage/libs/singular/groebner_strategy looks very often, and replies quickly.

yes, with `lex` Groebner bases are pretty bad, that's no surprise that one does not want full reduction (and there is no harm in postponing it, except one wants it, of course, too).

I'm just surprised that `libSingular` appears to change an option without asking.

git blame ascribes this to the original check-in of the file groebner_strategy.pyx (by Martin Albrecht), so we've never done differently. Given that we have pretty authoritative advice now, I think it would be reasonable to just ascribe it to incomplete information at the time, and make the change now. If there was a good reason, we'll discover it ...

Here is another example that seems to be solved by this. This does not involve a `lex` ordering I think, but only happens over non-prime fields.

```
sage: R.<x,y> = GF(101^2)['X,Y'].quotient('X*Y - 1')
sage: R('X^3 - X^2*Y')
x^3 - x^2*y
```

However, I could not find any documentation whatsoever on this `noTailReduction` flag. I think we should avoid using low-level functionality like this which we do not understand, as this is hard to maintain. Upstream suggested to call `kNF()` instead, so we should at least try that, unless we know more about why this was not done in the first place. In fact, looking at the code in `multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx`:

```
sage: R2.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, order="lex")
sage: I2 = R2.ideal(["x^2 - x", "y^2 - y"])
sage: R2("x + y^2").reduce(I2)          # calls _groebner_strategy().normal_form()
x + y^2
sage: R2("x + y^2").reduce(I2.gens())   # calls kNF()
x + y
```
