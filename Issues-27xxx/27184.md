Fix doctests in
- `_keys_for_vertices`: one doctest is fixed adding a `...`. The other is fixed by removing the call to `.vertices()` in the method (his is safe for the result of `graphviz_string`.
- `graphviz_string`: we change the failing doctest by something more stable when marked `py3` (again an issue of ordering of vertices and edges)
