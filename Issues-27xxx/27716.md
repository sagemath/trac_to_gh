<a id='comment:9'></a>Here are a few things:

- to get 100% coverage, the function `_nmz_result` should be tested. Perhaps also with a function name that does not exist?
- sage.matrix.constructor.matrix imported but not used
- pep8 around here, and blankline at end of file...........

```diff /src/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz
921             if  box_points<threshold:                                                                                                                                                                          
922                 from sage.geometry.integral_points import rectangular_box_points
923                 return rectangular_box_points(list(box_min), list(box_max), self)
```

Otherwise, it looks quite good, let's see what the bot says. vdelecroix mentioned in #25091 in comment #25091#comment:69 that 

```
import PyNormaliz
```

is not desirable... and we should use feature. I would not do this here but in a follow up ticket.
