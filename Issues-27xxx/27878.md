```
Currently the pexpect interface to gap call gap with the "-r" option.
From `sage/interfaces/gap.py`

```
gap_cmd = "gap -r"
```
This is a remnant of gap 4.8 and under where it enabled gap to be started in a quieter mode if I am not mistaken. There is no visible effect in starting gap with or without "-r" in gap 4.10 and over.

The only effect is more subtle. `~/.gap` and its equivalent on non linux system is not added to the list of paths where gap looks for packages. This means in turn that the option `ignore_dot_gap` in the function `all_installed_packages` (in `sage/tests/gap_packages.py`) is meaningless when a pexpect gap instance is selected. And a doctest introduced in #27681 will fail if you have something in `~/.gap`.

The doctest `./sage -t --long src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py`, with this branch, passes which would fail without the fix.

Hopefully the positive review will prompt someone to notice if there is any side effect.

As I wrote on the other ticket (#27913):

> I believe the opposite should be the case: By default the GAP interfaces in Sage should ignore a user .gap because it could potentially interfere with the functionality of Sage itself.


The problem is there is a tension here between Sage embedding GAP for its own uses, and users of Sage wanting to use GAP from within Sage and have it work the same as if they used GAP directly.

I think for the latter case, users should initialize their own GAP via the pexpect interface, and perhaps we should change things so that it's not necessarily the same GAP that Sage is using internally.

In the latter case I've also made very good progress getting the pexpect interface out of Sage's internal use cases (in this case for permutation groups) and porting it to libgap.  I'll have some tickets for that soon; I've just been very otherwise occupied.

Thanks François! This sounds very reasonable to me. There remains to force `-r` whenever running doctests, as discussed above.

For the option configuration, I am hesitating between two approaches. With the current commits, 
we abstract away from the user the specifics of how to tell gap to ignore `.gap`. This has some merit.

An alternative would be to provide a mean for the user to configure the arguments to the gap command; something like `gap_options = '-r', '-t', ...`. And to put in the documentation an example: "if you want GAP to ignore the .gap directory, you can use its `-r` option". This has the merit of being more flexible, and to empower GAP users that may already know of this option or others.

What do you think?

So dabbling with options is really reserved to people who know what they are doing.\n\nLastly, I introduced an option because this is something we want to have some programmatic control over.

I am not sure. First we are only talking about the pexpect interface in this ticket, Erik already mentioned there is currently no way to force libgap to ignore `~/.gap`. In the pexpect interface we already feed gap many options to get exactly what we want and a quiet interface - I was looking at the code in details earlier today. So dabbling with options is really reserved to people who know what they are doing.

Lastly, I introduced an option because this is something we want to have some programmatic control over. But it could have been achieved some different way. The documentation just over the one I introduced for `no_dotgap` reads

```
Use this code to change which GAP interpreter is run. E.g.,
::
       import sage.interfaces.gap
       sage.interfaces.gap.gap_cmd = "/usr/local/bin/gap"
```
This could be used to pass any options to gap

```
sage.interfaces.gap.gap_cmd = "gap -r -X -Y -myweirdoption"
```
rather than a gap in a different path.

You have to be clear here what you mean by "GAP in Sage".  The GAP interpreter included in the Sage distribution should work as similarly as possibly to a GAP distributed by the GAP project.  I.e. when you run `gap` directly (I'll call this case A).

Then there's the use of GAP within the Sage library itself which as I've mentioned has competing use-cases:  the GAP interface in Sage used directly by users as an interface to GAP without leaving the Sage interpreter (B), and then there's GAP used directly by Sage for internal use (C).

This principle applies to A and B, but emphatically *not* for C (even if there are ostensibly benefits to doing so, such as packages that provide alternative implementations of some algorithms that happen to be used by Sage; if that capability exists it should be enabled explicitly through Sage).

I think that the `gap` global made available to users in Sage should not be the same as that used internally by Sage.  I think a lot of problems like this can be resolved cleanly by not crossing these use-cases where it isn't necessary to.

Now that's a painful flashback from before you started being involved with sage Erik. It took me a while to figure out what was happening to my sage-on-gentoo install where I had installed the whole gap distribution.

I'll concede that your point (C) sounds reasonable but has the after taste of the package you customise specifically for sage (or some other software). 

Off course we want to move all of the use of point (C) to libgap I would imagine , which leaves the pexpect interface at your point (B). But having upstream giving you the tools to get to (C) would be nice.

I'll note that gap packages have the concept of recommended packages. Those are not dependencies but considered helpful but automatically loaded on presence which is harmful in our case (xgap is recommended in several packages).

Proposal at this stage. I must say I have been a bit confused and modeled my documentation on the wrong model now that I look back at it. 

The name. At first I was going for `use_dotgap` (similar to `enable_dotgap`) but I had to use it negatively which I didn't like at all. What about `disable_dotgap`?

Indeed it would be nice; but it's admittedly not easy.  I've been watching the efforts over the last few years to make multiple parallel embedded Python interpreters possible from libpython, and while it mostly works now it was not a trivial effort.  I think it's maybe a little easier for GAP than it was for Python, especially with HPC-GAP, where most of the important interpreter globals have been moved into thread-local variables.  But it's still non-trivial, especially when you involve things like C extension modules :/

It's something I would gladly help work on if I had the time to do so, which I don't (and I doubt most of the GAP developers do either, even if it would likely be a desirable goal).

I see now, after experimenting with this, that there is a technical challenge to it (I still think it is the right approach in principle).  The problem is that although it is possible to have multiple Gap interpreter instances, much of the code in Sage makes inconsistent assumptions that you are *only* using the "main" instance, currently the global variable named `gap`.

For example, SageObjects can have both a `_gap_` method, and a `_gap_init_` method.  The former returns the object's GAP representation wrapped in a `GapElement`.  It can take an *optional* `Gap` instance as an argument: The GAP interpreter instance in which to create the element.  The latter, `_gap_init_`, only returns a string of GAP code to be evaluated in the GAP interpreter to instantiate the object.  This is consistent with how other interfaces work.

The problem (or one of them) is that `_gap_init_` does *not* take an optional `Gap` instance, and just always assumes you're using the "main" `gap` instance.  This can lead to all kinds of inconsistencies, as sometimes the `_gap_init_` methods themselves query the Gap instance (e.g. what is the current `$sage` variable number) for details on how to evaluate the object.  So if you use one Gap instance in the `_gap_init_` call, but then pass the result of that call to a different `Gap` instance it is not guaranteed to work.

All right. I think it is also important to have the doctest that started it all to be fixed quickly.

In my research code (and in packages such as sage-semigroups), I really need to be using libgap (rather than a pexpect interface) for efficiency. I believe that's a common use case.

I see the rationale for aiming two separate gap instances, an incorruptible one for internal use, and a more flexible one for direct access by users. I don't know whether that's technically feasible at this stage though with libgap. Also we still want to be able to pass gap objects efficiently from internal code to user code.

Yes, indeed!

Currently yes, indeed. Now assume we were to have two separate instances of libgap, one for sagelib and one user-facing, to protect the former from corruption by e.g. user packages; then, it may become costly to move one object from one instance to the other.

I'm not sure many instances of libgap loaded as python extensions are technically feasible; this seem to mean that one would have to mangle names in the dlls to avoid clashes etc.

What might be feasible are several libgap workspaces.
