As reported in this [ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45469), we have currently (Sage 8.7.beta3):

```
sage: factor(2*exp(x) + exp(-x))
3*e^x
```
as well as 

```
sage: factor(x*exp(-x) + exp(-x))
(x + 1)*e^x
```

Another example of erroneous result exhibited in https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/ytLqIb4soLw/c14ZKGqcAAAJ is 

```
sage: var('t u')
(t, u)
sage: L = (u + t)/(u - t)
sage: factor(L.substitute(t=sqrt(u)))
(u + 1)/(u - 1)
```
This bug is there since at least Sage 8.4.beta4. It is not in Sage 8.3, hence it must have been introduced between 8.4.beta0 and 8.4.beta4. It seems to have been introduced in #23835 (see[comment:5](#comment%3A5)).

<a id='comment:2'></a>
in the same vein :

```
sage: e^(x+2*I*pi)
cosh(-x) - sinh(-x)
```
which is true, but largely not what we seek...

```
sage: e^(x+2*I*pi)==e^x
cosh(-x) - sinh(-x) == e^x
sage: bool(e^(x+2*I*pi)==e^x)
False
```
which is false. But :

```
sage: e^(x+2*I*pi).maxima_methods().exponentialize()
cosh(-x) - sinh(-x)
sage: (e^(x+2*I*pi)).maxima_methods().exponentialize()
e^x
```

Deserves to be `critical`, if not `blocker`.

<a id='comment:3'></a>
A difference between Sage 8.3 (where the factorization works) and Sage 8.4.beta4 is that in Sage 8.3 the factorization is performed by **Maxima**: cf. these lines of `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx` 

```
    def factor(self, dontfactor=[]):
        from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string, symbolic_expression_from_string
        if len(dontfactor) > 0:
            m = self._maxima_()
            name = m.name()
            varstr = ','.join(['_SAGE_VAR_'+str(v) for v in dontfactor])
            cmd = 'block([dontfactor:[%s]],factor(%s))'%(varstr, name)
            return symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string(cmd)
        else:
            try:
                from sage.rings.all import QQ
                f = self.polynomial(QQ)
                w = repr(f.factor())
                return symbolic_expression_from_string(w)
            except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
                pass
            return self.parent()(self._maxima_().factor())

```
while in Sage 8.4.beta4 and later, it is performed by **pynac** (via the function `g_factor`):

```
     def factor(self, dontfactor=[]):
        from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string
        cdef GEx x
        cdef bint b
        if dontfactor:
            m = self._maxima_()
            name = m.name()
            varstr = ','.join(['_SAGE_VAR_' + str(v) for v in dontfactor])
            cmd = 'block([dontfactor:[%s]],factor(%s))' % (varstr, name)
            return symbolic_expression_from_maxima_string(cmd)
        sig_on()
        try:
            b = g_factor(self._gobj, x)
        finally:
            sig_off()
        if b:
            return new_Expression_from_GEx(self._parent, x)
        else:
            return self
```
Maxima is correct there: in Sage 8.7.beta3, we have

```
./sage -maxima
(%i1) factor(2*exp(x) + exp(-x));     
                                - x      2 x
(%o1)                         %e    (2 %e    + 1)
```
So I would say it is a pynac bug.

**Seconded :**

If that means reverting the changes brought in by #23835, and if that does not break other changes intervening since, this would be a reasonable option (even if bad for performance), and would give people who know what they're talking about time to poner our next move...

Idem, +1. This sounds a good strategy for the short term. It would indeed be a pity if Sage 8.8 is shipped with such a bug. 
Benjamin, do you intend to take this in charge?

I already thought a bit about it, so yes, I will prepare a branch with the (short-term) bugfix I proposed above.

This is what I would suggest. I'm entirely open for suggestions regarding the name as well as the code for `is_rational_expression`.

Locally, I only checked the doctests in `expression.pyx`, maybe a patchbot finds further occurrences of the symbolic `factor` method where the output has to be changed.
