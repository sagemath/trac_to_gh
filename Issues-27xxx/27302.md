Some random remarks:

typo "refelection"

typo "Vancover"

burau >>> Burau

typo "availlable"

typo "as_permutatopn_group"

Use "Construct" and "Return" in the first lines of doc, not "Constructs" and "Returns"

"len(root_list) == 0" could be "not(root_list)" which is faster

```
+    TESTS:
+
+        sage: C3 = CubicBraidGroup(3)
```
is missing a double `::`

range(0, n-3) >>> range(n - 3)

In

```
rather use exact division `//`

From my first look-through, the code looks to be quite good. I have a lot of little comments that are going to be better handled as a push from me, but mostly they revolve around docstring formatting, not using `<>`, PEP8, and `if len(foo) == 0:` -> `if not foo:` (if you want to hunt them down and take care of them). Some more substantial comments are:

- A number of methods do not have doctests.
- I am tempted to get rid of the `Enum`, but at least I don't think it should be accessible from the top-level, which means it should not be a parameter of `CubicBraidGroup`.
- I am inclined to put `CubicBraidGroup` as the class with a `__classcall_private__` construction, which in some ways would contradict the previous comment. I might have to think more about this.

It seems that you didn't look at the most recent commit. I did some corrections
last week after inspecting the patchbot results more carefully and following Frédéric
Chapoton's hints. So, I think your comments above should be fixed, already.


> - I am tempted to get rid of the `Enum`, but at least I don't think it should be accessible from the top-level, which means it should not be a parameter of `CubicBraidGroup`.


In my first version (under Sage 6.9, the one I pushed to CoCalc) I didn't use `Enum`
since it was not accessible at that time. I'm used to avoid creating
code that depends on literals. Maybe this is an old fashioned, C-driven opinion,
but I'm still convinced that such code is not really save. So I changed this
since `Enum` is available, right now. By the functions `AssionGroupU/S` there
is no need for the user to have the `Enum` externally.

On the other hand I realized that it is still unusual to use `Enum` in Sage (there is
just one module (`modular_decomposition.py`) doing that). Therefore, I'm open to change this again.

I was pretty sure I was looking at the most recent commit because I clicked on the branch name. Although with beta1 released, there appears to be another (certainly trivial) merge conflict.

I go back-and-forth on the `Enum`. If this was C/C++, I would say definitely use it (and I do like the paradigm overall). The problem is in Python, it means we have to explicitly import it, and we have to put it into the global namespace if we want it to be top-level accessible to the user.

`__classcall_private__` essentially allows you to do extra processing on the inputs before getting to the `__init__` method. Thus we can actually return other parents/instances/objects/etc. if we deem the inputs worthy. Thus we can simply replace the `CubicBraidGroup` function with `CubicBraidGroup_class` (renamed to `CubicBraidGroup`), making it easier maintenance-wise as the top-level object is the class itself.

Although maybe we don't even need such a heavy tool as the `CubicBraidGroup_class.__init__` does the job, and we just have the default being the `Enum` for the standard cubic braid group. I think this might actually be sufficient.

Thanks for your explanations, Travis! Indeed, I had no good feeling to include the `Enum`
in the global namespace. So, I encoded the type into the names of the construction-functions.
But, this would not be an option for longer list of types (and is structurally not really nice).

Therefore, I now try the following solution:

1. I move the `Enum` into the class as a member, so that it is implicitly in the global namespace (via the name of the class).
2. I make the function `CubicBraidGroup` be the `__classcall_private__` method and rename the class accordingly as you suggested.

I keep the functions `AssionGroupS/U` for convenience even though there aren't necessary
any more (in order to capsule the import of the `Enum`). The remaining purpose of them is
to reduce key-strokes needed to create the corresponding instances. But, in principle they
could be removed.

Compared to the use of literals the advantage of the `Enum` is not only the paradigm, but
also the possibility for the user to select the type from the list:
