At the moment many (but not all) file `conf.py` in `src/doc/` get the varable `SAGE_DOC_SRC` using `os.environ` instead of importing it from `env.py`. There is not real reason for this as any setting of the variable in the environment will be picked up be `env.py`.

Apart from bringing a standard to files in `src/doc` importing variables from `env.py` helps with running sage directly from python without calling `sage-env`. This helps many distros and sage itself in the long run.
