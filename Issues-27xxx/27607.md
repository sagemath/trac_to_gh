I don't think I like this notation for ideals.  I'd rather have the ring printed before the generators, rather than after, so instead of (y)O, the ideal of O generated by y will print as O(y).

Any comments?

I decided to drop the ring notation entirely, and print LaTeX ideals as something like "(x-1,y)", without any indication of the ambient ring, because that seems to be the most common ideal notation used in textbooks - just the generators, in parenthesis, with nothing else.

This means that divisors print as something like "(x-1,y) - (x+1,y)", i.e, a first order zero at (1,0) and a first order pole at (-1,0).
