```
If a lattice has the standard basis, there is no need to print the whole basis matrix.
Here is a suggestion:

```
sage: IntegralLattice("E8")
Lattice of degree 8 and rank 8 over Integer Ring
Standard basis 
Inner product matrix:
[ 2  0 -1  0  0  0  0  0]
[ 0  2  0 -1  0  0  0  0]
[-1  0  2 -1  0  0  0  0]
[ 0 -1 -1  2 -1  0  0  0]
[ 0  0  0 -1  2 -1  0  0]
[ 0  0  0  0 -1  2 -1  0]
[ 0  0  0  0  0 -1  2 -1]
[ 0  0  0  0  0  0 -1  2]
```

Please replace `self.basis_matrix() == 1` by `self.basis_matrix().is_one()`.

Why don't you apply the same rule for the inner product matrix?
