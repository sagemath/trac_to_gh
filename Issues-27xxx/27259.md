In sage I have discovered 2 ways to assign weight to edges :
either by edge labels
or by using a weight function as used by shortest_path function().

Currently networkx_graph() is adding weights to networkx graph graph as its edge labels. To unify the pattern of edge weights in Sage,this method should also have weight_function() variable to be passed. It would be required if we were to use implementations of networkx algorithms in weighted graphs.

Any suggestions whether this would be the best thing or should I try something else? 

Note:
ticket:27480 is dependent on this ticket so as Page Rank algorithm to work in case of weighted graphs.
