There have been a spate of reports of issues like #26996 all stemming from people trying to build Sage on Linux systems that do not already have a supported Fortran compiler installed (but easily could). Likewise, for some other packages (openblas, R, ...).

embray suggests: I would [...]  just fail--with a helpful error message-at `./configure` time, at least on platforms like Cygwin and most Linux distributions, to just install the system's fortran compiler, unless a flag is given to explicitly request it.  [...]

In this ticket we just make it a friendly message at the end of the configure run -- not just for `gfortran`, but for all packages that have system packages. We will check if this already reduces the volume of messages regarding build problems on the lists.

Example:

```
config.status: creating directory local/lib
config.status: creating directory local/share
config.status: creating directory local/var/lib/sage/installed
configure: Hint: The following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:
configure:   cbc gp2c libsemigroups m4ri ninja_build pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_term_readline_gnu
checking for the package system in use... conda
configure: Hint: Installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ conda install coincbc m4ri ninja pari-galpol pari-seadata
configure: After installation, re-run configure using:
configure:   $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
```

I don't think that #26996 should be used as a reason. That's a bug in the build system, that we could just fix independently.

I'm not saying that this ticket by itself is a bad idea, just that #26996 is not a good reason for it.

I agree, that's not the motivation at all.  My point was that it happened to expose the fact that a *lot* of people, more than I'd imagined was the case, were trying (and in the past, presumably, succeeding) to build gfortran when it wasn't really necessary for them to.

Instead of refusing to build it, I think we should in general suggest a list of system packages to install, at the end of the `configure` run, similar to #26964.

I have revised the ticket description accordingly.

Good point.

I wouldn't mind making this change. Separate ticket?

Right.

That's right, this needs to be done. That would be a follow up ticket of #29104.

Yes, in #29124 (Add script packages build/pkgs/_prereq, build/pkgs/_toolchain, build/pkgs/_bootstrap) I plan to move these files to a better location.

This looks okay to me as a first step. We should do more to highlight the messages, at least by encouraging people to run `./configure` and read what it says.
