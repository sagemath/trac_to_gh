There have been a spate of reports of issues like #26996 all stemming from people trying to build Sage on Linux systems that do not already have a supported Fortran compiler installed (but easily could). Likewise, for some other packages (openblas, R, ...).

embray suggests: I would [...]  just fail--with a helpful error message-at `./configure` time, at least on platforms like Cygwin and most Linux distributions, to just install the system's fortran compiler, unless a flag is given to explicitly request it.  [...]

In this ticket we just make it a friendly message at the end of the configure run -- not just for `gfortran`, but for all packages that have system packages. We will check if this already reduces the volume of messages regarding build problems on the lists.

Example:

```
config.status: creating directory local/lib
config.status: creating directory local/share
config.status: creating directory local/var/lib/sage/installed
configure: Hint: The following SPKGs did not find equivalent system packages:
configure:   cbc gp2c libsemigroups m4ri ninja_build pari_elldata pari_galpol pari_nftables pari_seadata perl_term_readline_gnu
checking for the package system in use... conda
configure: Hint: Installing the following system packages is recommended and may avoid building some of the above SPKGs from source:
configure:   $ conda install coincbc m4ri ninja pari-galpol pari-seadata
configure: After installation, re-run configure using:
configure:   $ ./config.status --recheck && ./config.status
```

I agree, that's not the motivation at all.  My point was that it happened to expose the fact that a *lot* of people, more than I'd imagined was the case, were trying (and in the past, presumably, succeeding) to build gfortran when it wasn't really necessary for them to.

I prefer the milder solution - warning instead of error - for this ticket.

Good point.

> I don't see any message being printed on OS X with homebrew. Is this intentional? I guess so, since there aren't any files `build/pkgs/*/distros/homebrew`. Is that correct?


That's right, this needs to be done. That would be a follow up ticket of #29104.

> By the way, not related to this ticket, but is there a better place to put files like `build/pkgs/arch.txt`? In a directory `build/pkgs/DISTROS` or `build/distros`?


Yes, in #29124 (Add script packages build/pkgs/_prereq, build/pkgs/_toolchain, build/pkgs/_bootstrap) I plan to move these files to a better location.
