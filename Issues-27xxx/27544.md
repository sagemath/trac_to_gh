I noticed that the python2 SPKG (and probably python3 as well) install a number of `.pc` files in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/pkgconfig/`, some of which are symlinks:

```
$ cat local/var/lib/sage/installed/python2-2.7.15.p0
{
    "package_name": "python2",
    "package_version": "2.7.15.p0",
    "install_date": "Mon Mar 25 13:37:31 CET 2019",
    "system_uname": "Darwin osx.fritz.box 18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0: Mon Nov 12 20:24:46 PST 2018; root:xnu-4903.231.4~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64",
    "sage_version": "SageMath version 8.7, Release Date: 2019-03-23",
    "test_result": "",
    "files": [
...
        "lib/pkgconfig/python-2.7.pc",
        "lib/pkgconfig/python.pc",
        "lib/pkgconfig/python2.pc",
...
    ]
}
```

In this case `python2.pc` is a symlink to `python-2.7.pc`, and `python.pc` a symlink to `python2.pc`.

When uninstalling python2, these symlinks are not removed properly, but
you get warning messages:

```
Warning: File '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/python.pc' not found
Warning: File '/home/embray/src/sagemath/sage/local/lib/pkgconfig/python2.pc' not found
```

When rebuilding python2 (and this likely affects other packages as well) this can result in errors since the installer will refuse to copy over existing symlinks.

Because I didn't know `os.path.exists` dereferences symlinks :)

As much as I use Python I don't often use it for manipulating filesystem trees in non-trivial ways.  So even after ~15 years you can still learn something new and very basic (I'm sure I've encountered this distinction before, but not enough times for it to stick).
