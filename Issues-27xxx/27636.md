There is no current way to get edges from the depth_first_search traversal of the graph.\\
Add an extra parameter 'get_edges' to return the edges from the depth_first_search.

Hello, I have already worked on this for BFS([#18855 comment:1](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/18855#comment:1)) and that ticket is now closed. So, it would be good to implement a similar thing for DFS.

I am willing to work on this ticket.

I think, one way to implement this is to use a list of visited nodes(in the same sequence in which they were visited) to get the connecting node for the edge. Or is there a better way?

Should I do `git trac checkout 27636` to start?

The method you propose is not good: instead of a linear time algorithm, you propose a quadratic time algorithm.

I suggest to distinguish 2 cases, the aloe one that reports vertices, and the new one to report edges.
Then, for edges, instead of adding vertices to the queue, you add edges (with root to leaf orientation). Then, you yield an edge after a pop and add out edges to the queue.

In general, it is better to not touch parts of the code that have nothing to do with the method you are currently modifying. This is to avoid possible conflicts with other tickets. A better approach is to open a dedicated ticket.

Also, you have done partial corrections only like

```diff
-        -  ``quotient_matrix`` - (default False) if True, and
+        -  ``quotient_matrix`` - (default: ``False``) if True, and
```
a better formatting is

```diff
+        -  ``quotient_matrix`` -- (default: ``False``); if ``True``, and
```


Next, a simpler version could be

```diff
-                for i in range(len(queue)):
-                    v, d = queue[i]
-                    queue[i] = (None, v, d)
+                queue = [(None, v, d) for v, d in queue]
```

- you can open a new ticket to unify the documentation. I suggest to name the ticket `pep8 cleaning in generic_graph.py (part 15)`, as we already had several tickets to clean this file. See e.g., #26680, #26679.

- in this ticket, add the tests of #comment:12 to show that all cases have been considered.

I've added the tests but I've found a potential bug:

```
sage: D = DiGraph({1: [2, 3], 3: [4, 6], 4: [6], 5: [4, 7], 6: [7]})
sage: list(D.depth_first_search(1, edges=True))
[(1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 7), (3, 4), (1, 2)]
sage: list(D.depth_first_search([1, 5], edges=True))
[(1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 7), (3, 4), (1, 2)]
```
Obviously 5 is not getting printed since there is no edge involving 5 even though it is visited. Should't we still somehow indicate that 5 was visited? If so how? As in please suggest some appropriate output for that case and I'll make the necessary changes.

I added it in my local repository but I don't see how the output between starting from [0] or from [0, 5] should be any different? It is a circuit so the DFS from 0 just covers every vertex. For checking this case, shouldn't I make a graph with two disjoint trees for a DFS?
