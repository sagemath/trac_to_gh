This test is raising an exception and then it tries to display the traceback, long after the exception has been handled by the doctest framework. In Python 3 (and also after #24986), exceptions do not stay alive forever. The solution is fixing the test to construct the traceback in an `except Exception` block.

```

While I was at it, I fixed one more trivial doctest failure. All tests in `src/sage_setup/docbuild` now pass on Python 3.

That makes sense--I agree the test is not good in the first place.  Though I don't exactly understand why this changed.  Just because of the `sys.exc_clear()`?

It makes sense though--the Python 2 behavior of keeping exception objects and tracebacks around long past their applicability was not great to begin with.

Indeed. Python 3 effectively does `sys.exc_clear()` when leaving the `try`/`except` block.
