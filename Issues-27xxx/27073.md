This test is raising an exception and then it tries to display the traceback, long after the exception has been handled by the doctest framework. In Python 3 (and also after #24986), exceptions do not stay alive forever. The solution is fixing the test to construct the traceback in an `except Exception` block.

```

**********************************************************************
File "src/sage_setup/docbuild/sphinxbuild.py", line 212, in sage_setup.docbuild.sphinxbuild.SageSphinxLogger._log_line
Failed example:
    for line in traceback.format_exc().split('\n'):

**********************************************************************
```

While I was at it, I fixed one more trivial doctest failure. All tests in `src/sage_setup/docbuild` now pass on Python 3.

It makes sense though--the Python 2 behavior of keeping exception objects and tracebacks around long past their applicability was not great to begin with.

Indeed. Python 3 effectively does `sys.exc_clear()` when leaving the `try`/`except` block.
