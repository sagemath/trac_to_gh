```
In dimension 0, we now use the counting measure for volume:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[]]).volume()
1
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[]).volume()
0
```

Originally there was an attribute error:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[]]).volume()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'set_immutable'
```

When thinking about it again, I'm not sure anymore that this is the correct output.

However, an AttributeError is strange and the dostring does not indicate, what should happen.

Also it's confusing that the empty Polyhedron gives an output.

This might be related to #17339. If you want to have fun in the maze of defaulting behaviour, I challenge you to come up with a full-proof default behavior that will please everyone.

One thing that you should be aware of, is the current handling of things via different H and V inputs.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[])
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=[[]])
sage: P
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^0
sage: Q
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
```

The first one is the empty polyhedron. The second one is just one point, i.e. the full space. They are `__not__` the same.

<div id="comment:7" align="right">Comment 7</div>

Well, I can live with a meaningful 'NotImplementedError'.

Either there is a measure with ambient dimension zero or not. So the empty and the one point polyhedron in zero dimensional space should either have a well-defined behaiviour or not.

The reason I looked into it is that the original error is hard to trace back. It took me a bit to figure out, what went wrong there.

Replying to [@vbraun](#comment%3A17):
> Merge conflict, but isn't it also also mathematically wrong:
> * In the "ambient" measure, if ambient dim > 0, the volume of a point is 0

See line above. Which returns 0 in that case.
> * In the "ambient" measure, if ambient dim == 0, the volume of a point is 1
> * In the induced measures, the volume of a point is 1

A point is projected to 0-dimensional space an then 1 is returned.
> * The volume of the empty polyhedron is always 0

It has dimension -1 but ambient dimension at least 0, so zero will be returned.

I don't see which criteria is not met.

I guess I could start a new branch again, but only if someone sets it to positive review before the merge fails again.
