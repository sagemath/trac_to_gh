```
In dimension 0, we now use the counting measure for volume:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[]]).volume()
1
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[]).volume()
0
```

Originally there was an attribute error:

```
sage: Polyhedron(vertices=[[]]).volume()
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'set_immutable'
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>When thinking about it again, I'm not sure anymore that this is the correct output.

However, an AttributeError is strange and the dostring does not indicate, what should happen.

Also it's confusing that the empty Polyhedron gives an output.

<a id='comment:5'></a>This might be related to #17339. If you want to have fun in the maze of defaulting behaviour, I challenge you to come up with a full-proof default behavior that will please everyone.

One thing that you should be aware of, is the current handling of things via different H and V inputs.

```
sage: P = Polyhedron(vertices=[])
sage: Q = Polyhedron(vertices=[[]])
sage: P
The empty polyhedron in ZZ^0
sage: Q
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
```

The first one is the empty polyhedron. The second one is just one point, i.e. the full space. They are __not__ the same.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Well, I can live with a meaningful 'NotImplementedError'.

Either there is a measure with ambient dimension zero or not. So the empty and the one point polyhedron in zero dimensional space should either have a well-defined behaiviour or not.

The reason I looked into it is that the original error is hard to trace back. It took me a bit to figure out, what went wrong there.

See line above. Which returns 0 in that case.

A point is projected to 0-dimensional space an then 1 is returned.

It has dimension -1 but ambient dimension at least 0, so zero will be returned.

I don't see which criteria is not met.
