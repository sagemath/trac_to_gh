It is often practical to get directly the facets of a polyhedron object without having to compute or to know the dimension of the object.

This ticket implements the following shortcut:

```
sage: c = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: dim = c.dimension()
sage: c.faces(dim-1)
(A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices)
```

Now becomes:

```
sage: c = polytopes.hypercube(4)
sage: c.facets()
(A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
 A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^4 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices)
```

Suggestion: in the files `base.py`, `face.py`, and `library.py`, perhaps it would be nice to change the tests involving `faces(a_number_here)` where the intented thing is really `.facets`.

This way, the function is advertized in the documentation of functions, and also well-tested.

There are sufficient tests with `faces` that are not facets not to have this a regression. Further, it still uses `faces` anyways. So no loss in strength of testing...
