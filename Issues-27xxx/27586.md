Fix matrix/docs.py doctests errors.
Example :

```
File "src/sage/matrix/docs.py", line 115, in sage.matrix.docs
Failed example:
    M[range(2),:]
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/u1/chapoton/sage3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 671, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/u1/chapoton/sage3/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1095, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.matrix.docs[14]>", line 1, in <module>
        M[range(Integer(2)),:]
      File "sage/matrix/matrix0.pyx", line 926, in sage.matrix.matrix0.Matrix.__getitem__ (build/cythonized/sage/matrix/matrix0.c:6734)
        raise TypeError("index must be an integer")
    TypeError: index must be an integer
```


These errors were caused by `range` calls (range return iterator in py3).
