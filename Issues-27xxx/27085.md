The function `sphinx_plot`, introduced in #17498 to support the `.. PLOT::` directive provided by the matplotlib sphinx extension, creates all graphics by saving to a temporary PNG file first.

This ticket improves this function so that 2d graphics (including `GraphicsArray`s) are shipped out directly via matplotlib. In this way, proper SVG graphics can be generated for the HTML documentation.

With vanilla Sage, I get PDF files in `local/share/doc/sage/inventory/en/reference/plotting/sage/graphs/` when I'm building the html docs. For example:

  -rw-r--r--  1 palmieri staff     34 Jan 24 19:51 graph_plot-1.py
  ...
```
With the branch here:

Regarding the change

```diff

is `sphinx_plot` called with extra arguments anywhere (yet)?

It all works for me, but I don't have time to look carefully at the rest of the code. At a glance it looks okay, but if someone else is willing to take a closer look, that would be great.

In a follow-up ticket, it could be good to refactor it as follows: Remove the `sphinx_plot` function completely and instead giving every graphics object (including `GraphicsArray`s and the 3D graphics objects) a method `to_pyplot` (or similar) that will put the object in a pyplot figure. 

This would be useful for interoperating sage graphics with pure `matplotlib.pyplot` code, not just for Sphinx.
