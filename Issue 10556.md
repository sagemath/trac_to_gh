Assignee: was

When your hostname contains the string `.ac`, the name of a temporary file will also contain this string, and then tachyon's automatic file format detection will assume the input file is an ac3d file rather than the default tachyon scene file.

This causes tachyon to fail entirely on my machine in the domain `.ua.ac.be` and is likely also the cause of http://www.mail-archive.com/sage-support`@`googlegroups.com/msg11743.html .

The error message shown is "`Unknown version of AC3D Model File Format`".

The relevant lines in tachyon's main.c are


```
    else if (strstr(filename, ".ac") || strstr(filename, ".AC")) {
      rc = ParseAC3D(filename, scene); /* Must be an AC3D file */
    }
```
