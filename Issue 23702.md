The functionality of Integer Vectors is a subset of the functionality of the subset for Integer Lists Lex.  However, the documentation for Integer Vectors at

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/integer_vector.html

does not reference Integer Lists Lex (documented at

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/integer_lists/invlex.html ).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23939

```

rather than

```
:mod: `sage.combinat.integer_lists.invlex.IntegerListsLex`
```
