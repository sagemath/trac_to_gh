# Issue 23702: Link from IntegerVectors documentation to IntegerListsLex documentation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: ursula

Original creation time: 2017-09-29 11:24:01

Keywords: documentation, beginner, sd91

The functionality of Integer Vectors is a subset of the functionality of the subset for Integer Lists Lex.  However, the documentation for Integer Vectors at

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/integer_vector.html

does not reference Integer Lists Lex (documented at

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/integer_lists/invlex.html ).

I think it should be 

```
:class:`sage.combinat.integer_lists.invlex.IntegerListsLex`
```

rather than

```
:mod: `sage.combinat.integer_lists.invlex.IntegerListsLex`
```

Also, shouldn't sbrudzin be the author rather than the reviewer?

Author should be your real name (I've fixed it).
