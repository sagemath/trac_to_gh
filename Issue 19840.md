From [comment:15 cheuberg]:
> The docstring of `GenericGrowthGroup` (and the other growth groups) says "It has to be a subcategory of Join of Category of groups and Category of posets. This is also the default category if None is specified." which is a relict from the past.
> 
> Furthermore, we have
> {{{
>     # set everything up to determine category
>     from sage.categories.sets_cat import Sets
>     from sage.categories.posets import Posets
>     from sage.categories.magmas import Magmas
>     from sage.categories.additive_magmas import AdditiveMagmas
> }}}
> in the class `GenericGrowthGroup` which shows all these Categories in the documentation, similar as #20045.

Fix the docstrings!
