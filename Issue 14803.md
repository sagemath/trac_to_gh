Apply this last. This is the patch for the ticket, but it depends on the previous ones.

The attachment above has some minor changes that I had to make because of the patch's dependency on #15018.

The last patch listed in the attachments, trac_15040_errorhandling_logicparser.patch, is the only one that should be integrated into sage for this ticket.  The first four patches are the patches from the dependencies for this ticket, which were placed here for the convenience of the reviewer.
