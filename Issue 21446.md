After merging #17635, some modules were failing to link on Cygwin as first reported [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17635#comment:239).

My testing indicates that this fixes the issue (with thanks to jdemeyer for pointing out `library_order_list`).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21683
