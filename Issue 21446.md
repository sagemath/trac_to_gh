After merging #17635, some modules were failing to link on Cygwin as first reported [here](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17635#comment:239).

My testing indicates that this fixes the issue (with thanks to jdemeyer for pointing out `library_order_list`).

I can't test this, but if this works for you...

I mean, I guess as long as it doesn't somehow break things on _other_ platforms, though I see no reason it would.

Cygwin is the only platform where the linking order of libraries matters that much. I guess linkers on other platforms are more intelligent.
