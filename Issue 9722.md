Georg, if I've correctly guessed your trac name, could you please update the [Sage trac account name-real name map](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/wiki/WikiStart#AccountNamesmappedtoRealNames)?

As suggested by leif i have made the admins here (eth zÃ¼rich) install fltk-devel (fltk is installed anyway),
still does not work, the log message looks different now:

Shall we try to build pari 2.3.5 (released) now (y/n)? [n]
Ok. Type "make install" when you are ready

That's just the usual [Fedora 13 error](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DSOLinkBugs). ;-)

The simplest solution would be to uninstall FLTK completely, but since you seem to not have admin rights, we should perhaps fix this in the PARI package.

There's already a [new PARI Sage package underway](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/9343#comment:171), which is afaik intended to get merged into Sage 4.6, but I don't believe you want to wait for that.

So we have to decide if we want to provide a new intermediate PARI 2.3.5.p3 package here, to get merged into Sage 4.5.3. (I think we can solve this by a 9-character patch.)

Mitesh, your opinion?

Jeroen, perhaps you know if this is already fixed upstream/in svn 12577. (There are various ways to fix this.)

I'm not doing numerical calculations right now, but I'm trying to spread sage here (eth zÃ¼rich), which is a bit difficult if it does not built ;-), some of us are using it for teaching, the semester starts in middle of September, would be great to fix it until then,

Hmmm, I don't think this error showed up before Fedora 13 was released... ;-)

Where?

Anyway, I think I have a trivial patch/new spkg ready.

Are you familiar with patching spkgs? (Then you could apply it yourself immediately - or make sure it works on Fedora 13; I've only tested it on Ubuntu, where this is not an issue. It does _not_ fix the first error, i.e. PARI attempting to use FLTK despite no headers being present, since I currently cannot reproduce that. I could perhaps fix that later though.)

We had Fedora 11 before, where the same error occured, my second report is here:

no, is it difficult, where is the new spkgs?

Since all the machines are the same, it should also fix the first error, since this is obviously the default state of the machines,

Nice. A trivial work-around, if you simply want to compile Sage/PARI *without* FLTK is:

```
export PARI_EXTRA_OPTS="--with-fltk=no"
```

(This will complain that the directory `.../no` does not exist, but proceed building without FLTK.)

I don't have an account on sage.math, so I could only put it into the volatile ftp directory. (But someone else could move it.)

Applying patches to spkgs is relatively simple. If you have Mercurial (`hg`) installed:

```sh
$ tar xjf /path/to/pari-2.3.5.p2.spkg
$ mv pari-2.3.5.p2 pari-2.3.5.p3
$ cd pari-2.3.5.p3
$ hg import /path/to/spkg-patch.patch # replace with appropriate filename
$ cd ..
$ tar cjf pari-2.3.5.p3.spkg pari-2.3.5.p3
```

Then you can install the new spkg the usual way (`./sage -i ...`, but perhaps first copy it over to `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard` to get around limitations of `sage-spkg`, and then type `./sage -i pari-2.3.5.p3`).

Ok, I've read this too late...

Wouldn't be bad then to install `libfltk-dev` on _all_ machines... (I would assume the machines get configured/installed from a central server anyway.)

If it helps, I don't mind merging an intermediate / incremental PARI package in the 4.5.3 series.

Leif, I can make your package available on sage.math.  Since it's ~2 MB, just send it to me by email.

Although I haven't tried it myself, it might be easier to set up and use [spkg-upload](http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/).

Hello Georg,

On both system, there is libfltk library installed in /usr/local/lib64/, but no
matching header files in /usr/local/include is provided, so compiling fltk does not work.
Configure output a warning:

###
### libX11.so not found. Please install X11 development files.
### They usually come in XFree86-devel (RPM) or xlibs-dev (Debian) packages
###
### X11 not found
###

So either install XFree86-devel (or whathever is the correct name of fedora) or use
--graphic=none to disable graphics.

Installing fltk and fltk-devel does not work because the version of fltk it provides is
not compatible with the one in /usr/local/lib64/ (this is only a guess).

Cheers,
Bill.

In any case, PARI shouldn't attempt to build with FLTK support if no (or not matching) header files are present; the second (linker) error is also definitely a bug, which currently only shows up on Fedora 13 (and derivatives) due to [stricter linkage rules](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnderstandingDSOLinkChange).

I couldn't (yet) reproduce the errors on 32-bit Fedora 13 though, most probably because _other_ headers and libraries weren't installed. (I tested installing Sage's PARI spkg with only `fltk-1.1.10-1.fc13`, and then in addition `fltk-devel-1.1.10-1.fc13` installed; both with PARI 2.3.5 and the new PARI 2.4.3 svn snapshot from #9343.)

I'll examine that later in more detail.

Comment by leif created at 2010-08-16 19:01:05

P.S.: Btw, we *do* (unconditionally) configure PARI with `--graphic=none`...

(Although the user can set `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS` to pass additional configuration options; cf. my trivial work-around above.)

Comment by mpatel created at 2010-08-19 09:11:43

Should we reply to the PARI developers with Leif's points?

For now, can we bypass PARI's FLTK checks altogether because/when we use `--graphic=none`?

Cf. also #9343. I couldn't reproduce PARI attempting to build FLTK on any system, including Fedora 13 (32-bit though).

And we already pass `--graphic=none` to PARI's `Configure`...

(I wonder if Georg _wanted_ PARI to use X11/FLTK.)

The missing libstdc++ in `plotfltk`'s libraries is of course a bug (which my patch solves).

Comment by leif created at 2010-08-19 09:44:12

We could in addition bypass (`if false && test ...`) this part of `Configure` for use with Sage:

```sh
...
if test "$optimization" != profiling; then
  . ./get_X11  # X11, X11_INC, X11_LIBS
  . ./get_graphic_lib # which_graphic_lib
  . ./get_fltk # FLTKDIR, FLTK_LIBS
  . ./get_Qt   # QTDIR, QTLIB
  echo "Hi-Res Graphics: $which_graphic_lib"
  . ./get_readline # $_readline_list (includes 'readline')
else
  which_graphic_lib=none
fi
...
```


But that's not very nice, and unless I can reproduce the problem...

And this would of course break graphics support for other users completely.

LOL, that's because you _don't_ have _X11_ development packages installed! :)

`config/get_fltk`:

```sh
if test -z "$with_fltk"; then
  case "$which_graphic_lib" in
    fltk) with_fltk=yes;;
  esac
  if test -z "$X11"; then with_fltk=yes; fi

PARI is really funny. I'll fix _all three_ issues and upload a second patch here later...

Whatever you do, it would be good to report these issues upstream.  The PARI developers usually accept patches which fix bugs (although they are sometimes slow).  

I haven't followed up on this ticket so much, but does the new version (see #9343) also need patching?

:) I'm not that sure what the _intended_ logic behind the graphics detection scripts is, so at least one of the fixes is rather targeted at PARI/GP _in Sage_.

So I'll first provide a patch for PARI 2.3.5[.p2] / Sage 4.5.3, then we can see what we report upstream and what we fix in (our) 2.4.3 svn / for #9343 / Sage 4.6.

(The answer Georg got from upstream did not really address his problem btw.)

Yes, definitely, despite the scripts having changed between these versions.
I've also commented on that at #9343 a few hours ago...

> PARI is really funny. I'll fix _all three_ issues and upload a second patch here later...

I would have guessed that adding `--graphic=none` makes `Configure` skip all graphics detection tests.

I can make an updated spkg with your new patch and host it on sage.math.

I'd like to release 4.5.3.rc0 by Monday, 23 August, and if all goes well, 4.5.3 by the end of next week.  Since the necessary changes here aren't trivial --- we'd need to test them on "all" platforms --- I suggest that we fix this ticket in the new PARI spkg at #9343, which I'll merge into 4.6.alpha0.  This presumes that #9343, #9591, and #9592 will be ready.  I'll send a message to sage-devel about their status.

That's great!  Do you think, for any reason, it'll take more than two days, say, to fix all three problems?

SPKG patch, apply to PARI 2.3.5.p2. Fixes Fedora 13 link error when FLTK is used. (Updated version, only doc changes.)


---

Attachment

*New PARI spkg (p3)*, with the attached patch applied:

http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pari-2.3.5.p3.spkg

This *only fixes the linker error* on Fedora 13 (that occurred when `fltk-devel` was installed).

If you run into the _compiler_ error, convince your system administrator to
 * _either_ install `fltk-devel`
 * _or_ remove an (invalid) _unversioned_ link to the FLTK library installed. (I.e., if only `fltk` is installed, there should be no `libfltk.so`, but just versioned filenames like e.g. `libfltk.so.1.1`, perhaps including _versioned_ symbolic links to the actual libraries.)

I'll perhaps later upload an improved (p4) spkg that also makes the FLTK-devel detection more robust, s.t. the compiler error shouldn't occur either, even with such unexpected links present.

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2010-08-22 22:20:45

For me, this has a positive_review, because:
 * I viewed the patch, it makes sense (fltk is c++ after all) and looks good.
 * It doesn't break anything on various systems which I tried (none of these is Fedora though).
 * It fixes the problem for leif (I have *not* tested this).

Leif: keep me up to date with your potential .p4.  I assume this patch has to be ported also to #9343?

I've compiled a `pari-2.3.5.p4-preview.spkg` (changes not yet checked in, still testing on some systems with various combinations of parameters and installed packages):

```
### pari-2.3.5.p4 (Leif Leonhardy, August 23th 2010)
 * #9722: "--graphic=none" is now respected by PARI. We still look
   for graphics libraries, but don't use them in that case (see below,
   too).
 * #9722: Improved patch to config/get_fltk (makes sure the header
   files are present, too, if the FLTK library was found - fixes
   compiler error on IMHO misconfigured installations).
   We still look for FLTK components even if "--graphic=none" was
   specified, and print appropriate messages, but then simply do not
   use them.
 * #9722: New patch to config/get_X11:
   - Added/corrected/clarified messages regarding what was (not) found,
     and if this is really relevant.
   - An X11 library in */lib64/* will be found now, too (if we do a
     64-bit build); on Fedora, libX11.so is located in /usr/lib64.
   - Added comments.
 * spkg-install:
   - Clear (unset) lots of variables that might (unintentionally) be
     used by PARI; perhaps upstream should initialize them.
   - Clear GP_INSTALL_PREFIX, which is interpreted by PARI.
   - Added help & informational message regarding PARI_EXTRA_OPTS; in
     addition, allow the user to override Sage's "--graphic=none"
     since this now works (see above; we don't want to annoy users
     that perhaps previously made use of GP's plotting support).
 * Clean-up in spkg-install:
   - Quote more environment variables (including SAGE_LOCAL).
   - Consistently use $UNAME instead of `uname` (set in sage-env).
   - Added some comments.
 * NOTE: At least some of these changes should be incorporated into
   our PARI 2.4.3 (svn 12577, see #9343), and/or reported upstream.
   I haven't changed config/get_Qt. It seems Qt support is broken on
   newer systems (because Qt <=3 is expected), but this doesn't break
   the build, only Qt will not be used.
```

Contact me if you are interested in testing this, too. (Appreciated.)

-Leif

Note that this currently is just a diff, not a proper Mercurial patch ("changeset").

That's a lot of stuff to look at :-)

I am personally a fan of GNU `autoconf` for these situations because a lot of these checks can be simplified. However, I tried in vain to convince the PARI/GP developers to use `autoconf`. Maybe I should do it for Sage just to prove a point...


---

Comment by leif created at 2010-08-23 08:09:27

Some people call it GNU autocrap...

Also a matter of taste (I personally find the `configure` scripts readable), but autotools often unnecessarily slow down the installation process, and it's easy to build bad scripts with them, too.

Btw, I've meanwhile prepared a new, slightly corrected (wrt. `--graphic=none`) p4 spkg, with also some more comments and improved messages.

I'll update the attached diff here, and after a bit more testing also a link to the (hopefully final) spkg.

(More interesting are the diffs of `get_X11` and `get_fltk`, i.e. `patches/get_{X11,fltk`}.)

I know some people are against it (for reasons which I never fully understand), but given the choice between editing a configure.ac script and PARI's mess, I will choose the former.

I'm with Jeroen on that. Properly used, `autoconf` can simplify the build process considerably. 

Of course, any tool badly used can result in a mess. There's one part of Sage where `Makefile.am` is a file that one is expected to edit for "site customisation". Clearly the person using it did not have a clue what he/she was doing. 

I would strongly suggest the Pari developers move to `autoconf/automake`. I've personally not used `libtool` for development, so can't really comment on that. 

Pari's system, where there are specific targets, is always going to be a problem when versions of operating systems change and people have different search order for their PATH. In contrast, the `autoconf` system tests what actually works, using the settings the person building the code has. 

Also, the autoconf/automake mailing lists are very active and helpful. In contrast, I've found with `SCons`, which is another build tool used in Sage, that getting help is very difficult. That takes too much control away from the programmer. I know there's one part of Sage (I forget which) where a developer removed SCons code and replaced it by a Makefile.

SPKG patch, now a proper Mercurial changeset. Apply to pari-2.3.5.p3.spkg. (Further improvements w.r.t. graphics support; some clean-up.)


---

Attachment

After testing various combinations of installed (graphics) packages and PARI configure options (`$PARI_EXTRA_OPTS`) on 64-bit Fedora 13, 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04, I'm now quite confident with it and will "release" PARI 2.3.5.p4.

I've replaced the p4-preview diff by a Mercurial patch, and will shortly provide a link to the "final" spkg, with all changes committed.

_"Please build, test, and report!  We'd love to hear about your experiences with this new package."_<sup>TM</sup>

(I've so far only tested the spkg on top of Sage 4.5.3.alpha0 and 4.5.3.alpha1.)

Replying to [comment:44 leif]:
> [...] will shortly provide a link to the "final" spkg, with all changes committed.

New spkg now available: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pari-2.3.5.p4.spkg

> _"Please build, test, and report!  We'd love to hear about your experiences with this new package."_<sup>TM</sup>

I think the easiest way to test this is to copy it into `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/standard`, set and export `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS` as you like, and then do:

```sh
$ ./sage -f pari-2.3.5.p4 2>&1 | tee my_log-parameters.log
```

The "cumulative" spkg install log automatically created by Sage is `$SAGE_ROOT/spkg/logs/pari-2.3.5.p4.log`.

Potential settings for `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS` are:
 * empty / unset (no graphics support; default)
 * `--graphic=auto` (should use X11 if available)
 * `--with-fltk`
 * `--with-qt` (likely to not build on newer systems, requires some Qt development packages too, i.e. _can_ lead to build errors; should disable graphics support if no Qt libraries are found)

Thanks for testing this; we really would like to release Sage 4.5.3[.rc0]...

P.S.: Should work on all reported machines at ETH ZÃ¼rich, too (with or without `fltk-devel`, even if `--with-fltk` was specified). ;-)

Of course Sage can also be built from scratch with this spkg; just copy the spkg as mentioned above to `spkg/standard` (Sage will automatically pick the newest), and then type `make` or `make build`.


> (I've so far only tested the spkg on top of Sage 4.5.3.alpha0 and 4.5.3.alpha1.)

Also installed without problems on Sage 4.5.2, now running `ptest`.

P.P.S.: The positive review of this ticket currently only applies to the p3 spkg.

Oops.  I should have set `PARI_EXTRA_OPTS=--graphic=X11`.  With this, I don't get an error.

Yes.  I think we can ask for Leif's help.

Although I can't test every branch in the patched `Configure` script, the changes look correct to me.  The package also installs and tests well on a variety of systems.
