Currently at least in `guava`, a part of `gap_packages`, there is a hardcoded `gcc` in some makefiles.


```
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: Entering directory '/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/gap/gap-4.8.6/pkg/guava-3.13'
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] if test ! -d bin/amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0-clang-devel-default64;  then mkdir -p bin/amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0-clang-devel-default64;  fi
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] gcc -O2   -c -o src/ctjhai/minimum-weight.o src/ctjhai/minimum-weight.c
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: gcc: Command not found
```


As well, I see in `grape` log there

```
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] checking host system type... Invalid configuration `amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0': machine `amd64-unknown' not recognized
```

but this is otherwise seemingly harmless.

This issue would be fixed by #26856.

fixed, or at least updated. In fact I fixed these things in guava upstream lately, but they have not yet made it into new GAP.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

yes, this will be fixed by #26856 - I backported the upstream fix, in fact, just forgot about it already.

Fixed by #26856.  Hurrah for incidentally fixing 20 month old issues.
