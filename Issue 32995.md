# Issue 32995: sage -t : Write report in JUnitXML format

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33232

It is a standard format for test reporting, supported by major tools; for example:
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/output.html#creating-junitxml-format-files

To write:
- https://pypi.org/project/junit-xml/

To read:
- https://junitparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Why we want it:

1) Make patchbot failure reporting useful when base already has some failures

Pytest can be used to extract tests from an arbitrary file using the [pytest_collect_file](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#pytest.hookspec.pytest_collect_file) hook, see [for an example to parse Yaml files](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/doc/en/example/nonpython/conftest.py). Thus it would be an idea to this to plugin sage's custom doctest discovery/format and profit from pytest JUnitXml format among many other output formats.

Yes, sounds like a good approach
