Some platonic solids in plot/plot3d/platonic.py are not correct, because they are spread over multiple lines.  Fix this.  

Things like 

```
sage: dodecahedron(color='orange', opacity=0.8) + \
      sphere(size=0.5, color='black')
```

Good to go!

About `RR(1)->RR.one()`. I assume that you do this because it is how it is 'advised' as it is apparently faster (I have no first-hand experience on these matters), but I still find `RR(1)` better for the doc since it is more user-friendly.

Well. Matters of taste.

Thanks for this branch,

Nathann
