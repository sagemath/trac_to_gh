Reported by Mate Soos:


```python
sage: B.<a,b,c,d> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: F0 = PolynomialSequence(map(lambda f: f.lm(),[a,b,c,d]))
sage: F0
[a, b, c, d]
sage: parent(F0[0])
MonomialMonoid of Boolean PolynomialRing in a, b, c, d
sage: type(parent(F0[0]))
<class 'sage.rings.polynomial.pbori.BooleanMonomialMonoid'>
sage: F0.groebner_basis()
AttributeError: 'BooleanMonomialMonoid' object has no attribute 'ideal'
```


In this case the matching ring should be used.
