# Issue 26613: Small fix for unicode_art of IndexedFreeModuleElement

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2018-12-06 23:03:43

Keywords: unicode_art

The `unicode_art` of `IndexedFreeModuleElement` incorrectly returns type `str` for the zero element.


```
sage: S = SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
sage: unicode_art(S.zero())
'0'
sage: type(unicode_art(S.zero()))
<type 'str'>
```


As a result, building `UnicodeArt` expressions that have zero as subexpressions fails with an `AttributeError`. This can be particularly unexpected with the `%display unicode_art` option. Various algebras are affected by this.


```
sage: unicode_art([S.zero()])
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get_breakpoints'
```
