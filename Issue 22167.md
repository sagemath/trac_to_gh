# Issue 22167: Some improvements and cleanup to ETuple

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: tscrim

CC:  jdemeyer dkrenn

Keywords: polynomial, ETuple

We should have a fast method to check whether an `ETuple` is representing a constant rather than create the list of `nonzero_positions`. This also makes some more methods `cpdef` with explicit return types and some other little bits of cleanup.

LGTM. I've added a commit where in polydict.pyx blanks are added after commas, except for tuples representing the exponents. Please cross-review.
