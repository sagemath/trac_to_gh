Add two arguments for sage-coverage

 - `--only-bad` to print only informations about bad files
 - `--summary` to print only a summary

We also introduce the usage of the `argparse` python module.

Attachment

In [This is the Trac macro *attachment:bad_files.txt* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#attachment:bad_files.txt-macro) (= output of `sage-coverage --summary $SAGE_ROOT/src/sage`) one can see that we have
 - 401 files with wrong documentation
 - 1514 functions with no doc
 - 563 functions with no test
 - 310 doctest are potentially wrong

I added a commit at public/17841. If that's fine for you, then I guess it can go.

Your version did not work because of the variable `first` not being available.

Thanks!
