I marked all doctest `optional` and updated.


Suddenly, one doctest doesn't work anymore:

```
sage: g = graphs.CubeGraph(9)
sage: p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(solver = "SCIP")                # optional - pyscipopt

sage: b = p.new_variable(binary=True)                               # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.set_objective(p.sum(b[v] for v in g))                       # optional - pyscipopt
sage: for v in g:                                                   # optional - pyscipopt
....:     p.add_constraint(b[v]+p.sum(b[u] for u in g.neighbors(v)) <= 1) # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.add_constraint(b[v] == 1) # Force an easy non-0 solution    # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)                      # optional - pyscipopt
sage: p.solve() # rel tol 100                                       # optional - pyscipopt
```
 
and totaly chrashes sage with an error message `free(): invalid pointer`. I don't quite know what is going on. 

What is really weird is that it works if I don't run the last line, but instead:

```
sage: q = copy(p)
sage: q.solver_parameter("limits/absgap", 100)
sage: q.solve()
0
```


(I temperarily change `9` to `4` in the doctest above, in order to be able to run the rest of the doctest. The current branch works without failures for me.)

On the plus side

- do like the other backends

On the minus side

- two files (pxd/pyx) instead of one
- longer compilation time
- more delicate to debug

The reason why all other backends are written in Cython is because they do call C functions.

In the last commit, you added `elif solver == "Scip":` but in other places we have `for s in ["Cplex", "Gurobi", "Coin", "Glpk", "SCIP"]:` and in the last comment you used `'scip'`. I'm not sure which is the correct way to write it. In fact, I think that the name of the solver should not be case sensitive.

I tried different ways to write `scip` in `~/.sage/init-doctests.sage` and it's working, but I cannot ensure that `SCIP` has been used...

While searching for an example, I found an issue:
- in method `G.pathwidth`, we can specify àlgorithm="MILP"` but not the solver
- in method `from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation import vertex_separation` we can not set parameter `integrality=True` that is used in `from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions.vertex_separation import vertex_separation_MILP`. It is currently set to `False`. The problem is that with `SCIP`, I get an error when set to `False` and the correct answer when `True`.

So we should:

- add a dockets with the Petersen graph  marked `# optional - pyscipopt` (too long for glpk)

I checked why copying is so incredibly slow (see #33238).  Apparently, almost all of the time is spent in preparing the arguments for `add_linear_constraint`, more precisely, in `self.model.getConss()[index]`.  Indeed, calling `row_bounds` only once saves a quarter of the time.  
I have not found the definition of `self.model.getConss()` yet, but perhaps that there is some copying going on?

Here is the necessary modification to the backend:

Indeed.

So we are creating a list of 4100 constraints, pick one, throw the list away again.  We do this 4 (or at least 3) times per constraint, and for each of the 4100 constraints.

In #33238, I need to solve a program with temporarily added constraints.  In principle, I see two options for doing this:

1. copy the MILP, add the new constraints to the copy, solve, throw away the copy

2. add the constraints, solve, remove the constraints

Currently, I am doing 1., because I am afraid that I cannot control what happens when adding a constraint.  In particular, a clever solver might detect that it is redundant, or an even more intelligent solver might rewrite the whole list of constraints.

Removing constraints is supported by our frontend and backend interfaces and by the SCIP API.

Are you saying that it is *very* hard to imagine a solver that rewrites the constraints upon solving?

I would prefer that my code works generically, and not just specifically for SCIP.

Also, I don't really have any means to identify a constraint, except by index.  I admit it may be silly, but in principle I do not even know whether my solver adds a constraint at the beginning or at the end.

It might indeed be faster to add and remove constraints, because I am doing a lot of this.  However, comment:138 seems to contradict comment:137 and comment:135.

So maybe we could have some kind of flag telling us whether a solver does rewrite constraints or not?

I recommend that in your code you wrap your use of `add_constraint` with a check that exactly one constraint is added - just to document this assumption (which you are allowed to make).

Well, there is another thing with adding and removing: removing will - with the patch above - unnecessarily recompute the list of constraints again.  If I additionally check that adding the constraint also increases the number of constraints by one, then I have this overhead twice.

It's a bit strange that the backend needs the constraint to remove it, whereas in sage we need the index.

That said, replacing copy with adding/removing constraints makes a HUGE difference for this problem, roughly a factor of 8!

I won't be able to improve `__copy__` right now, but I'd appreciate improvements.
