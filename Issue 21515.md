This patch will change some colours to colors.

The real question is larger: shall we add "Use US english" to the developer manual? I think that we should. (I have no prefence, but US english is currently more used.)

OK, but what you think about


```
class Color(object):
     def __int__(self):
         """
         Return the integer representation of this colour.
```


or like? Fortunately we have only one form used as keyword or function name. I suppose that you wouldn't like them to have different spelling.

I vote for invalid.

I think that code (methods, functions, classes) should all follow US English (this is just far too common in CASs so far; and it should be consistent), so for example `g.find_colors` together with `g.colourful` should definitely be unacceptable, but docstrings with GB spelling, even if the function name is in US spelling, is fine with me.
