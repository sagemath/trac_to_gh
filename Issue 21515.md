This patch will change some colours to colors.

The real question is larger: shall we add "Use US english" to the developer manual? I think that we should. (I have no prefence, but US english is currently more used.)

Got no interest about US/GB -issue.

So I just mark this colour->color as _needs_review_. Please review, either to milestone sage-7.5 or to milestone wontfix.

I disagree with enforcing a particular spelling.  Both are perfectly acceptable, and permitting both has absolutely no effect on readability.  I just expect people who use one variant to get annoyed by others "correcting" their spelling to the others' preferred variant.

Same opinion. I vote for duplicate/invalid.

OK, but what you think about


```
class Color(object):
     def __int__(self):
         """
         Return the integer representation of this colour.
```


or like? Fortunately we have only one form used as keyword or function name. I suppose that you wouldn't like them to have different spelling.

(You can be sure that I have no personal preference of which one to use. My native language is quite far from english.)

I vote for invalid.

I think that code (methods, functions, classes) should all follow US English (this is just far too common in CASs so far; and it should be consistent), so for example `g.find_colors` together with `g.colourful` should definitely be unacceptable, but docstrings with GB spelling, even if the function name is in US spelling, is fine with me.

(It is perhaps not super-aesthetic; but I guess we can live with it)
