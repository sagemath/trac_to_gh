The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) scheme has since that time reigned supreme as the most widely accepted and implemented general-purpose approach to public-key encryption. Generate a pair of public/private keys. Use the public key to encrypt a plaintext. Then decrypt the resulting ciphertext using the private key. Finally, compare the decrypted message with the original plaintext. This is based on the thesis by Minh Van Nguyen about number theory and RSA encryption algorithm. i didnt know how secure it was, so I would like to share this contribution with all of you.

Just a few quick observations:

- What is the intended use of the code one included in Sage? If it's for teaching you would probably want to expose more of the details. In fact, for educational purposes it's probably better to do the whole construction "in the open" instead of wrapping it in a class, unless the educational part is wrapping things in classes. For actual cryptographic use, one would probably prefer a whole protocol library. The algorithm is a very small part of deploying cryptography in a secure manner.

- In your code you call `euler_phi(n)` to compute the private key d from e. Since the public key is (n,e), anyone could do that same calculation. That means that if it is doable for you to compute the private part of the key, then it is also doable for anyone. You don't have an advantage. (HINT: the key is that euler_phi computes the factorisation of n. If you would make sure that 2**p-1 and 2**q-1 are actually prime, you would know the factorization of n and hence euler_phi(n). But you should not call euler_phi(n), because that throws away your advantage).

Do people have some lower level scenario in mind where it's sufficient for the students to play around with a crypto "black box"?

I don't mind if it gets included for a good reason, but if the code here isn't going to be used properly and frequently in teaching I'd rather not have it in there, because it will take away from the excitement that students get from implementing their own RSA if there's already such an implementation available in sage.

Trivial comment: a number of things in the documentation are marked as code

```
``561=3*11*17``
```

that should probably be marked as math markup

```
`561=3*11*17`

or something along those lines.

Nils' argument presumably applies to nearly all the stuff in the `crypto` folder, though, doesn't it?  Certainly the only current public-key one.

I guess it depends on whether you are going to ask students to *code* things like DH or RSA, or only to "do" them.

    "body": "`@`vdelecroix, thanks for bringing the `__init__` and `__eq__` methods to my attention. I copied the implementations from ajeeshr, who had copied them from `BlumGoldwasser`, the other `PublicKeyCryptosystem`. The reason `BlumGoldwasser` implements them is to override the `PublicKeyCryptosystem` implementations, which is necessary because `BlumGoldwasser` doesn't initialize its superclass properly (it may be helpful to read the code for the Cryptosystem class's `__init__` and `__eq__`, which can be found on lines 104-212 in cryptosystem.py). \n\nI modified `__eq__` to fix the issue you identified. Now, the method just compares the class of the two objects being compared. This is a change that should also be made to `BlumGoldwasser`. \n\nHowever,  `__init__` will be trickier to fix properly. According to the `Cryptosystem` class, which `RSACryptosystem` inherits through `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, I should be passing the following arguments to my superclass's `__init__` method: `plaintext_space, ciphertext_space, key_space, block_length=1, period=None`. Without fixing this, inherited methods like the following will fail: \n\n```\n  sage: rc = RSACryptosystem()\n  sage: rc.key_space()\n  AttributeError: 'RSACryptosystem' object has no attribute '_key_space'\n```\n\nThe following values seem to make the most sense to me, but I'm not certain: \n* plaintext_space = group of all integers\n* ciphertext_space = group of all integers\n* key_space: I have no idea how to specify this one as a group. \n\nIdeally, I would give plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as integers mod n, instead of the group of all integers. However, this would require giving the RSACryptosystem class state, recording public and private keys internally. This would have the effect of making it more opaque, since users wouldn't need to explicitly pass keys to encrypt and decrypt. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as the groups of all integers. Comments on this would be appreciated. \n\nSide note: `__init__` will also need to be fixed in `BlumGoldwasser`:\n\n```\n  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser\n  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()\n  sage: bs.key_space()\n  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'\n```\n\n\nAlso, as suggested by kcrisman, I corrected several formatting issues with the documentation. Thanks to vdelecroix, I removed unnecessary redeclarations of variables in my tests, except where redeclaring improved readability.",

The reason `BlumGoldwasser` implements them is to override the `PublicKeyCryptosystem` implementations, which is necessary because `BlumGoldwasser` doesn't initialize its superclass properly (it may be helpful to read the code for the Cryptosystem class's `__init__` and `__eq__`, which can be found on lines 104-212 in cryptosystem.py). 

I modified `__eq__` to fix the issue you identified. Now, the method just compares the class of the two objects being compared. This is a change that should also be made to `BlumGoldwasser`. 

However,  `__init__` will be trickier to fix properly. According to the `Cryptosystem` class, which `RSACryptosystem` inherits through `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, I should be passing the following arguments to my superclass's `__init__` method: `plaintext_space, ciphertext_space, key_space, block_length=1, period=None`. Without fixing this, inherited methods like the following will fail: 

```
  sage: rc = RSACryptosystem()
  sage: rc.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'RSACryptosystem' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```

The following values seem to make the most sense to me, but I'm not certain: 
* plaintext_space = group of all integers
* ciphertext_space = group of all integers
* key_space: I have no idea how to specify this one as a group. 

Ideally, I would give plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as integers mod n, instead of the group of all integers. However, this would require giving the RSACryptosystem class state, recording public and private keys internally. This would have the effect of making it more opaque, since users wouldn't need to explicitly pass keys to encrypt and decrypt. Thus, I think it makes sense to keep plaintext_space and ciphertext_space as the groups of all integers. Comments on this would be appreciated. 

Side note: `__init__` will also need to be fixed in `BlumGoldwasser`:

```
  sage: from sage.crypto.public_key.blum_goldwasser import BlumGoldwasser
  sage: bs = BlumGoldwasser()
  sage: bs.key_space()
  AttributeError: 'BlumGoldwasser' object has no attribute '_key_space'
```


Also, as suggested by kcrisman, I corrected several formatting issues with the documentation. Thanks to vdelecroix, I removed unnecessary redeclarations of variables in my tests, except where redeclaring improved readability.

A few comments on this:
* You can open a separate ticket for the `BlumGoldwasser` stuff, no need to fix it here.
* You should use the `TestSuite` functionality, I guess, to ensure that all such possible errors are caught.
* One possible option would be to make those spaces be `NotImplementedError` or something, and then document it as such.  
* Another one is that, considering

```
class PublicKeyCryptosystem(Cryptosystem):
    r"""
    The base class for asymmetric or public-key cryptosystems.
    """
```

  is the entirety of the constructor for `PublicKeyCryptosystem`, and that several of the systems in the `crypto/` folder don't even inherit from `Cryptosystem`, one could just ignore this altogether and not inherit from it if there seems to be no reason to.
* Or you could use integers. 
* Or you could build it in but then `RSACryptosystem(n)` would be needed. That's sort of like how the other ciphers require you to put in the alphabet, so it isn't totally farfetched.

Of the options you described, I think the best is simply to not inherit from `PublicKeyCryptosystem` or `Cryptosystem`. If I inherit from either of them, implementing the `plaintext_space`, `ciphertext_space`, etc. would require accepting `p` and `q` when an `RSACryptosystem` object is initialized. However, since this is a pedagogical module, that is undesirable, since I want to keep `calculate_keys(p, q)` explicit. 

Consequently, in this next patch I have removed inheritance from `PublicKeyCryptosystem`.
