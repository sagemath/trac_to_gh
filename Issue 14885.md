Thanks, fixed. This issue appears in a zillion other places, though... Can't we create an alias in whatever code builds the doc?

Hey Darij,

A minor thing, but could you shorten the error message on line 442 to something like `"{} is not the same size as {}".format(self, other)`? Looks good to me otherwise.

Thanks,

Travis
