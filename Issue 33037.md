I didn't test any of the "beta" releases

This actually came to light when a Dockerfile failed:


```
FROM sagemath/sagemath:9.3
USER root
RUN apt-get update
```


fails with a "GPG error: http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hirsute-security InRelease: gpgv, gpgv2 or gpgv1 required for verification, but neither seems installed" error

I tried all the images before I uploaded them, so either something has changed in docker since then or there's something specific about your setup here.

Just tried again sagemath/sagemath:9.4 and sagemath/sagemath:9.5 both work fine for me.

Changing priority from major to minor.

Changing status from new to needs_info.

What changes is that non-LTS distributions such as hirsute and impish get their repositories deleted soon after EOL. Then `apt-get update` will fail.
