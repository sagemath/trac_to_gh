Move the NTL error handler out of `c_lib` to a Cython module. Also create a new exception class `NTLError` (inheriting from `RuntimeError` to not break backwards compatibility). All this is completely analogous to the PARI error handler.

Given the new `.pxd` file, do we still need the `setup_NTL_error_callback` as defined in `c_lib/src/ntl_wrap.cpp` and `c_lib/include/ntl_wrap.h`?

Also you're missing a colon in `EXAMPLES:` in `setup_NTL_error_callback()`.

No, we no longer need that function. But removing `ntl_wrap` will be a different ticket.
