The following

```
log(e - val//2)/log(2)
```
can easily be deduced from the number of digits of `e - val//2`. This would better be computed with

```
(e - val//2 - 1).nbits()
```

Concerning speed

```
sage: %timeit ceil(log(2**5)/log(2))
1 loop, best of 3: 36.9 ms per loop
sage: %timeit (2**5 - 1).nbits()
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.19 Âµs per loop
```

Thanks for taking a look. 

I am using log and ceil from libc, not the symbolic ones, which changes the timing by quite a bit. Also, using nbits would mean that e must be an Integer, not (say) an int.
