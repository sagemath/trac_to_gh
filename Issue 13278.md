While working on #715/#11521, a sporadic error has occurred:

On bsd.math (hence, OS X on Intel chips), `sage -t sage/misc/cachefunc.pyx` fails with signal 11. Apparently it is fine on different machines, even though with additional patches (such as #13370 or #12876) there are signal 11 in other tests and on other machines as well.

The segfault disappears when running the tests in verbose mode. It also disappears if the tests are run under gdb (but then a different error occurs, that is unrelated with the problem we are dealing with here).

Nils (see #715) was able to track the problem down to libsingular. He found (correct me if I misunderstood):

A segfault occurs in `MPolynomialRing_libsingular.__init__` in the line:

```python
        self._ring = singular_ring_new(base_ring, n, self._names, order)
```
Digging deeper, he came to `sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx` in the lines:

```python
    _names = <char**>omAlloc0(sizeof(char*)*(len(names)))

    for i from 0 <= i < n:
        _name = names[i]
        _names[i] = omStrDup(_name)
```
Strange enough, the segfault occurs in `omStrDup`.

He found several ways to work around:

1. In `sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx`, copy the strings manually, such as
 {{{#!python
    for i from 0 <= i < n:
        _name = names[i]
        j = 0
        while <bint> _name[j]:
            j+=1
        j+=1     #increment to include the 0
        copiedname =  <char*>omAlloc(sizeof(char)*(j+perturb))
        for 0 <= offset < j:
            copiedname[offset] = _name[offset]
        _names[i] = copiedname
 }}}
 provided that the parameter `perturb` is at least 7.
2. Modify manual refcounting in `sage/libs/singular/ring.pyx` to prevent deallocation:
 {{{#!diff
     wrapped_ring = wrap_ring(_ring)
     if wrapped_ring in ring_refcount_dict:
         raise ValueError('newly created ring already in dictionary??')
-    ring_refcount_dict[wrapped_ring] = 1
+    ring_refcount_dict[wrapped_ring] = 2
     return _ring
 }}}
3. Use a strong cache for multivariate polynomial rings.

Options 2. and 3. would not be nice: The aim of #715, #11521, #12215 and #12313 was to make caches for parents weak in order to prevent memory leaks.

Since the problem disappears when deallocation of libsingular rings is prevented, it seems that the bug is in the deallocation of libsingular rings. Note that the problem is *not* fixed by #13145.

I don't know if it is an upstream bug or a bug in the Sage library. Hence, no idea what to report upstream.
