Keywords: python3

This is often considered the most important change in Py3. The approach still has to be determined!

The tool 2to3 simple changes `unicode` to `str` and removes the u-prefix from string literals (`u'xxx'` to `'xxx'`).


But the code has to depend on the Python version! 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16079
