CC:  @kliem @zlscherr jhpalmieri

(from #31132)

#27122 determines whether `CC` accepts `-march=native` and then adds it globally to `CFLAGS` in `build/bin/sage-build-env`.

However, Python extension modules are compiled with the compiler listed in sysconfig. On macOS with homebrew, using `/usr/bin/python3`, this could be `clang`, which does not accept `-march=native`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31228

Do we manually set the Compiler to be different somewhere vor is this enforced by using system python? If not, is there a reasonable place to check this?

Can this happen to python modules only?

This is the standard behavior of python's distutils. Only Python extension modules are affected.

`m4/sage_check_python_for_venv` defines a macro used by `build/pkgs/python3/spkg-configure.m4` to check the suitability of distutils.

These are probably the best places to put additional checks.

If this fails, I have to build extension modules with `export CFLAGS=CFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` and `export CXXFLAGS=CXXFLAGS_NON_NATIVE` somehow.

Looks plausible, however I don't see exactly, where `-march=native` was added such that this command fails.

Maybe we need to add `-march=native` yet:


```
            AS_IF([CC="$CC" CXX="$CXX" CFLAGS="-march=native" CXXFLAGS="-march=native" conftest_venv/bin/python3 conftest.py --verbose build --build-base=conftest.dir >& AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD 2>&1 ], [
```


But I'm just hoping they are respected.
