MPIR 1.0 brings significant speed improvements. An spkg can be found at

/home/mabshoff/build-3.3/sage-3.3-fulvia/spkg/build/gmp-mpir-1.0.rc5

I have integrated two fixes for OSX and Solaris/x86 so that the test suite passes on both systems which will be in the final MPIR 1.0.

Cheers,

Michael

Very good.  And it's nice that there is no patches/ directory and all issues are upstreamed :-).
