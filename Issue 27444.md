Keywords: gap libgap

I don't fully understand the problem yet but there seems to be an issue in 8.8.beta2 (if not earlier) related to GAP workspaces.

The only way I've been able to reproduce it reliably is by running


```
$ rm -rf ~/.sage/gap/*
```


and then


```
./sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/tableau.py
```


at some point during this test (possibly others but this is the only where I've reliably reproduced the issue) things start to go horribly wrong:

ISTM like maybe some memory corruption occurs as a result of trying to load a corrupt or partial GAP workspace.  It's really bad, whatever it is.

Some additional observations:

* I can also reproduce the problem by doing just `rm -rf ~/.sage/gap/gap-workspace-*`; i.e. deleting just the pexpect gap workspace and not the libgap workspace.

* If I instead do `rm -rf ~/.sage/gap/libgap-workspace-*` the test passes every time, but no new libgap workspace is created (as if the test does not use libgap at all; I haven't confirmed this but it seems to be the case).

* However, if I delete *both* workspaces the test fails and both a `gap-workspace-` and a `libgap-workspace-` are created.

This seems to fit it, with the aid of #27680.

Ironically, it was while testing #27680 that I discovered this issue, and at first I thought it was caused somehow by my changes in that ticket.  But I can confirm that it's not related at all.

The problem stems (for reasons I still do not understand and are disturbing) from the fact that libgap was actually being used in the process of initializing a new workspace by pexpect GAP.  Somehow this was causing problems; perhaps related to package loading.

It's still disturbing that this could cause such a problem, and I can't seem to reproduce the issue in other examples of using both GAP interfaces simultaneously.  It must come down to some subtle resource contention issue within GAP itself, and we can make some progress toward avoiding it by taking more care not to use both GAPs simultaneously during workspace caching.

I'm not sure it has *nothing* to do with libgap.  In [0b6d94ee](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=0b6d94ee889e35b167b616fc4b9488a29cedc6d1) I fixed a problem where libgap was being used *during* pexpect-gap initialization in the `all_installed_packages` function.

This seemed to alleviate the problem somewhat, but it seems to be more of a bandaid.

What's really weird is that the way the problem manifests itself is in the form of some pretty severe memory corruption affecting just random things in Sage.  And I would think that only the libgap interface would be capable of breaking things that badly.

I haven't looked at the issue in a few weeks though so I don't have any good ideas at the moment.  I need to start looking at it again...

I don't see how `--serial` matters - unless it can be used to run a script after each test...

I'm not sure how you concluded that, but it is a possibility I suppose.  I'd be more concerned that it's a problem with forking, which *does* happen when running the doctests, but doesn't normally happen when running interactively.  So it can make things difficult to reproduce.  Nevertheless, I can't reliably reproduce the issue anymore either, and the one thing I did fix here seems to help a bit...

The leading `AtlasRep` is in fact something I had forgotten in my `~/.gap` and that will soon be cleaned. But it points to the fact that the way we start `gap`'s pexpect interface makes it ignore `.gap`. You could say we start `gap` in a mode that also happens to be a "safe mode" (all your personal settings ignored) and that really should be a different option upstream.

In the meantime, should we amend the test so that `ignore_dot_gap=True` in both case in a follow up ticket.

Just to document so I can point to it next time. In gap-4.10.1 you have the file `src/system.c` which controls many OS dependent things including how gap starts. Currently line 1297 onwards

```
#ifdef HAVE_DOTGAPRC
    /* the users home directory                                            */
    if ( getenv("HOME") != 0 ) {
        strxcpy(DotGapPath, getenv("HOME"), sizeof(DotGapPath));
# if defined(SYS_IS_DARWIN) && SYS_IS_DARWIN
        /* On Darwin, add .gap to the sys roots, but leave */
        /* DotGapPath at $HOME/Library/Preferences/GAP     */
        strxcat(DotGapPath, "/.gap;", sizeof(DotGapPath));
        if (!IgnoreGapRC) {
          SySetGapRootPath(DotGapPath);
        }
		
        strxcpy(DotGapPath, getenv("HOME"), sizeof(DotGapPath));
        strxcat(DotGapPath, "/Library/Preferences/GAP;", sizeof(DotGapPath));
# elif defined(__CYGWIN__)
        strxcat(DotGapPath, "/_gap;", sizeof(DotGapPath));
# else
        strxcat(DotGapPath, "/.gap;", sizeof(DotGapPath));
# endif

        if (!IgnoreGapRC) {
          SySetGapRootPath(DotGapPath);
        }
```

So if `IgnoreGapRC` is "false" you get `.gap`. Where is that variable coming from? It is documented in the same file at line 150

```
/****************************************************************************
**
*V  IgnoreGapRC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -r option for kernel
**
*/
Int IgnoreGapRC;
```

and finally more interestingly we have this at line 1077

```
  { 'r', "", toggle, &IgnoreGapRC, 0 }, /* kernel */
```

and in sage we have in `sage/interfaces/gap.py` at line 205

```
gap_cmd = "gap -r"
```

At this stage I don't know if that option is a remnant of gap-4.8 and lower or if it is really needed.
