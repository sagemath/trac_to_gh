the internals of python's tarfile.py have changed, and the override of `_extract_member` in `uncompress/tar_file.py` misses parameters. Namely, if your system python is python3, you will get

I don't think I've tried building Sage with Python 3 as the default "bootstrap" Python, but indeed that should definitely work, especially as more distros are finally defaulting to Python 3.

Is this the only issue you've encountered so far?

This is the first bug one hits, I didn't go further. I suppose that merely adding the extra (Python3-only) key arguments to the functions overriding the ones in the library will do here (as key args are optional, and so more is OK for Python2 as well).
