Can you add more comments to better explain the steps.

You define `visited` as a list. Be aware that with lists, a test like `v in visited` requires linear time (in the size of the list). You should use a set instead as testing membership to a set requires constant time.

I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. My DFS initialization is not fast. In fact, it's slower than the implementation without it. 

Here are the results of some tests carried out on complete digraphs:

**Without initialization**

*1000 vertices*

**Mine, with initialization**

You should do the following:

- make a non recursive version of the DFS. It should be faster.

I changed the non-recursive version. One of the difficulty was to ensure that an edge is selected before starting to process it's head.

I also did various edits in the code (coding style) and changed a few names.

I added another parameter to choose between the recursive and non-recursive versions. We will have to remove it later.

In some cases (e.g., rome), the non-recursive version is faster, but on complete graphs it is slower. I don't know why. At least it is correct and robust.
