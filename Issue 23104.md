CC:  @kiwifb

porting lcalc to C++11
    
* "using namespace std;" need an include with stuff from std:: before it
    
* "typeof" is a gcc extension - C++11 has "decltype" instead
    
* plain C must not be compiled with C++ compiler - thus a makefile change

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23341

this is needed for building lcalc with `-std=c++11`.
(tested so far with clang 4.0.1 on Linux, with `stdlib=libc++`)

Only the top commit is of interest. Perhaps it can be based on rc0 indeed. But I need sleep now :-)

OK :)

The next question is how to ensure that the compiler then uses c++11. lcalc doesn't have a configure script so we cannot do it there.  At the very least `spkg-install` will need to insert `-std=c++11` in `CXXFLAGS` to make sure you are always using c++11.

the other problem here is an incorrect building of lcalc extension. Here C++ is compiled with a C compiler, which is patently wrong.
Any idea how this can be fixed?

We may assume that all the C++ compilers we care about support `-std=c++11`, right?
So this may be an independent of clang tickets thing?

indeed, and as a part of the clang porting effort too - it's just too much trouble to have different packages with different `c++xy` IMHO, especially if one depends on the another, they better be on the same `xy`...

I'll see how it flies with these patches, and open a ticket.

Somehow I cannot manage to achieve this; 
it all works if I do

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./sage -f lcalc
```

but somehow does not work if I put into spkg-install

```
$MAKE CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

OK some comments on the review from Jeroen which made me dig a bit deeper on the Makefile. I must say I adopted a slightly different approach in sage-on-gentoo so I don't have the same patch, but some of lesson learnt will definitely apply.

* the original makefile defines CC as as g++ so that has to go.
* Non standard flags like CCFLAGS are used, so Dima tried to use appropriate flags for both C and C++ compilers. And it also differentiate C and C++ flags which wasn't done before because even regular C code was passed to the C++ compiler.
* The downside of using CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS inside the makefile is that regular options passed from the sage build system may need care if we want to inject them. That's a sage-on-gentoo difference I use `MYCXXFLAGS` so I can include whatever other flags we pass without worry.
* Jeroen points out the standard rule for `.c` file should be used for `cmdline.c` except that the current patch erroneously define the rule as using CXXFLAGS instead of CFLAGS. Oopsie.

Point of difference with sage-on-gentoo: because pari headers are included in two files with `#include "pari.h"` the makefile has to define the location of pari headers and so do any code that include these headers. Decided that it was not worth it and patched to have `#include "pari/pari.h"` which is more sane and means that we don't have to worry about adding non standard includes. That means that I cut an extra bit of the makefile too. If people think that's a good idea I'll include that change in sage too.
