```
L = LatticePoset(DiGraph('IYOS`G?CE?@?C?_@??'))
L.is_relatively_complemented(certificate=True)
```


May output `(False, (1, 8, 9))`, but the certificate should be `(7, 8, 9)`. The bug may not be visible in all architechtures.

Corrected. Test code:


```
for i in range(1000):
    L = Posets.RandomLattice(10, 0.99)
    result = L.is_relatively_complemented(certificate=True)
    if not result[0]:
        a, b, c = result[1]
        ac = L.interval(a, c)
        if len(ac) != 3 or b != ac[1]:
            print("BUG!")
            break
else:
    print("All OK")
```


Contains also three non-related trivial "are are" typos.

Could you please correct another typo (same line as the first "are are"):

```
when these are not stongly
```

should be "strongly"

once done, you can set to positive
