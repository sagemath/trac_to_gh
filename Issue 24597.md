The easiest way I've found for dealing with interfaces that use `subprocess.Popen` is, on Python 3, to simply specify an encoding for the subprocess I/O.  Unfortunately this argument doesn't exist on Python 2 (a wrapper for this might be nice but the examples are few enough that I haven't been compelled to bother).

Why `latin-1`? That's a strange choice.

I think it would be nice if you added the comment about latin-1 in the source code where you use it. Sure, it's in the commit history, but once we drop Python 2 support (and remove the `if` clause,) it will not be the commit message for the last change in that lineâ€¦and it's certainly something that is very suprising to read there.

Once this is documented, I am very happy to give this a positive review.
