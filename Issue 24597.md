Why `latin-1`? That's a strange choice.

I think it would be nice if you added the comment about latin-1 in the source code where you use it. Sure, it's in the commit history, but once we drop Python 2 support (and remove the `if` clause,) it will not be the commit message for the last change in that lineâ€¦and it's certainly something that is very suprising to read there.

Once this is documented, I am very happy to give this a positive review.
