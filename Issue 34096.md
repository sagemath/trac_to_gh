There is also the one within the Sage library:

```
sage -t --warn-long 62.5 --random-seed=230138939486715312795148381621394057005 src/sage/tests/modular_group_cohomology.py

I don't know the math well enough to be able to do the computations myself, but I hope that Simon (or his coauthor) can check the calculations arising in

```
sage: from pGroupCohomology import CohomologyRing
sage: H = CohomologyRing(27,4)
sage: H.make()
sage: BC = H.bar_code('LowerCentralSeries')
sage: BC.show()
...
sage: BC.data()
...
```

and in particular the `ascii_art` error here.
