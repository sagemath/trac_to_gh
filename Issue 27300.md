On Python 3.7, this doctest times out:

```
            sage: from sage.parallel.map_reduce import RESetMPExample, RESetMapReduceWorker
            sage: from threading import Thread
            sage: EX = RESetMPExample(maxl=6)
            sage: EX.setup_workers(2)

            sage: w0, w1 = EX._workers
            sage: w0._todo.append(42)
            sage: thief0 = Thread(target = w0._thief, name="Thief")
            sage: thief0.start()

            sage: w1.steal()
            42
            sage: w0._todo
            deque([])
```

With what version of Sage does the doctest time out? Is it still the case?

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
