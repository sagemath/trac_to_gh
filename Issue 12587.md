I already have an spkg working around this, as well as using `ecl -norc ...` as recommended by an ECL developer.

Diff between the previous spkg in Sage and my new p1 spkg. For reference / review only.

I've also added a comment regarding the contained PDF files to `SPKG.txt` (cf. attached diff).

Looks like the main issue (i.e., multiple words in `LDFLAGS`) meanwhile got fixed upstream (as of Maxima 5.29.1, see #13364);  I'll probably try to incorporate the other fixes into the Maxima spkg there.

Personal note:  Deletion of unused PDF files belongs to `spkg-dist` and/or _Special !Update/Build Instructions_.

Can this be closed as duplicate of #13364?

`env LDFLAGS="-DFOO -DBAR" ./sage -f maxima` works fine so I guess it's no longer an issue.

This indeed appears to be fixed, as far as I can see.
