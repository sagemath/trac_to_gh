Looks good so far.

- Assign the default value only at one place: in the `Variable`.
- Put the import of `Infinity` directly in the class call, not at the top of the file.
- I think, the asymptotic ring does not need an attribute `_center_`. This should be stored in the `Variable` and the asymptotic ring should just the growth growth group for the center and the growth group asks the varibale. (I.e. asymptotic ring and growth group only have a property center, but not an attribute.

Do i need to set the default case for `center` also in the growth_group? At the moment the default case is declared in the asymptotic ring constructor. 
The import of `Infinity` is now placed in the class call. I think i should do the same with the asymptotic_ring. I have some questions regrading the last item, can we talk about them tomorrow at the office?
