This likely conflicts with #17460, can you rebase on top of that please?

(Tested with many of the positively reviewed search-and-replace tickets, but perhaps not all.)

It is normal that, on `develop.6.8.beta1` i got at least 262 calls to the `.next()` method ?


```
$ grep -R '\.next(' | wc -l
262
```

Not all of the `.next()` method calls can be converted to `next(...)` function, because the related object is no iterator.  
I opened #18592 to convert some of the methods.
