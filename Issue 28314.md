Before:

```
sage: P=posets.TamariLattice(7)
sage: %time P.moebius_function_matrix()
CPU times: user 606 ms, sys: 553 Âµs, total: 607 ms
Wall time: 606 ms
429 x 429 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```


After:

```
sage: P=posets.TamariLattice(7)
sage: %time P.moebius_function_matrix()
CPU times: user 359 ms, sys: 3.85 ms, total: 362 ms
Wall time: 362 ms
429 x 429 dense matrix over Integer Ring (use the '.str()' method to see the entries)
```

It is a more memory intensive version, but I don't think it is too significant, especially compared to the speedup. LGTM.
