Sorry, this slipped my mind for several months, and I need to relearn how to use the trac system every time....

Overall it looks good, but I haven't taken a full detailed look at the code. Here are my current comments:

- You can replace `return sorted(list(C))` by `return sorted(C)` as `sorted` takes any iterable.
- Be consistent with your spaces, in particular `X == Y` and `X < Y` and `X + Y`.
- Doc formatting
  {{{
        r"""
        Determine whether ``self`` is partitionable.

        A partitioning of a simplicial complex `X` is a decomposition of its face
        poset into disjoint Boolean intervals `[R,F]`, where `F` ranges over all
        facets of `X`.

        The method sets up an integer program with

        - a variable `y_i` for each pair `(R,F)`, where `F` is a facet of `X`
          and `R` is a subface of `F`
        - a constraint `y_i + y_j \leq 1` for each pair `(R_i, F_i)`,
          `(R_j, F_j)` whose Boolean intervals intersect nontrivially
          (equivalent to `(R_i\subseteq F_j and R_j\subseteq F_i)`)
        - objective function equal to the sum of all `y_i`

       INPUT:

        -  ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) if ``True,`` and ``self``
           is partitionable, then return a list of pairs `(R,F)` that form
           a partitioning
  }}}
