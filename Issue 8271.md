The iconv package, which will be added to Sage (#8191), 
dumps core on Solaris 10 SPARC, though all tests pass on Linux, OpenSolaris and OS X.

Full details will be added later -  I created this ticket to get a trac number.

I'm now told by the iconv developers this is a Solaris bug:

```
You see "Segmentation Fault - core dumped" messages, but the test suite
continued to run and passed. ("make" did not report a failing target.)

The 'check-subst' file contains a comment about the origin of these messages:
  # This printf command crashes on Solaris 10.
  # See <http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6550204>.

So, it does not indicate a bug in GNU libiconv, only in a Solaris program that
is used by the testsuite. Harmless.

Bruno
```

I expect with some patches, this could be solved, as it was fixed several years ago, but I'm testing this on an early release of Solaris.
