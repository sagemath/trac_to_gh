Keywords: gamma function

There are numerical inaccuracies in the gamma function on python floats on some platforms. See, e.g. 
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/3c8c61ea113ea60c

Also, the current implementation is slower than it should be on basic types:

```
sage: timeit('gamma(6.0r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 32 µs per loop
sage: timeit('gamma(6r)')
625 loops, best of 3: 44.3 µs per loop
sage: timeit('gamma(6.0)')
625 loops, best of 3: 22.9 µs per loop
sage: timeit('gamma(6)')
625 loops, best of 3: 3.29 µs per loop
```

Thanks for the patch. I agree that considering float and complex types separately in the fast evaluation path makes sense for speed. However, this causes inconsistencies with the results you get when a value is substituted into the expression.

We still need to modify the `py_tgamma()` function in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx` to fix this:

```
sage: gamma(x).subs(x=6.r)          
120.0
```

AFAICT (without applying the patch and testing), attachment:12449.patch removes the `try/except` block around `return getattr(args[0], self._name)()`, disabling the call to `BuiltinFunction.__call__` later on in the function body.

This would be a good occasion to merge my patch from attachment:trac_1173-move_call.patch:ticket:1173. I'll try to rebase your patch on top of that.

For the gamma function, at least, python has its own implementation. Of course, that function itself might call some underlying libc functions, so maybe it won't be entirely consistent, now that I think about it.

In the bit of testing that I did, math.gamma was less accurate than tgammal on my computer, but much more accurate than gsl's gamma function.

It turns out that Python implements the gamma function itself:

http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/58bd6a58365d/Modules/mathmodule.c#l226

I uploaded a new patch that changes `py_tgamma()` in `sage/symbolic/pynac.pyx` to use Python's gamma implementation.

I give a positive review to attachment:12449.patch. If someone can review my patch we can switch this to positive review.

BTW, this will fix #9162. We should close that as a duplicate.

Three remarks:
1. that test is also one that is failing on ARM ; and there's a trac ticket about binomial's implementation being pretty wrong (#12448).
2. should that test use "#tol abs" instead of doing the computation itself?
3. shouldn't it be even a "#tol rel" ?

Obviously the following comment doesn't apply then:

```
# It is more accurate than gsl's gamma function and 
# should provide consistant results across platforms.
