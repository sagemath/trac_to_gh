Still a bit more work to do in terms of the documentation, but the functionality is all done.

To this and other tickets: Currently and in the future I see I have no time for [SageMath](SageMath). `:(`. I have already left sage-devel list.

But I'll try to answer if there are questions specific to me, mostly if they are about code I have written.
