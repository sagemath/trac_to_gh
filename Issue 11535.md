# Issue 11535: Remove `readlink -n` and `realpath` from $SAGE_ROOT/sage

Keywords: SAGE_ROOT

The file `$SAGE_ROOT/sage' contains the lines

```
if [ "$SAGE_ROOT" = "....." ];  then
    SAGE_ROOT=`readlink -n "$0" 2> /dev/null` || \
    SAGE_ROOT=`realpath    "$0" 2> /dev/null` || \
    SAGE_ROOT="$0"
```


However, `readlink -n` certainly does not do what is intended:
- It only works when `$0` (the sage executable itself) is a symbolic link
- If the sage executable is a symbolic link, then `readlink -n` returns the link itself, not the canonicalized name.  Example: if `/usr/local/sage-4.7.1/sage` is a symbolic link to `sagefoo`, then `SAGE_ROOT` would become `sagefoo` when `'/usr/local/sage-4.7.1/sagefoo` is intended.

Maybe, the whole `readlink`/`realpath` logic should be removed.

Haha, had the same idea just yesterday.

IMHO we should use (the more portable and perhaps simpler)

```sh
(cd "$WHEREVER"; NORMALIZED_PATH=`pwd -P`)
```

to get a canonical form in shell scripts.

I'm not sure if this also fixes the apparently sometimes prepended automount prefix (cf. `sage-ptest` etc.).

I guess you mean

```
NORMALIZED_PATH=`cd "$WHEREVER"; pwd -P`
```

because otherwise the "NORMALIZED_PATH" from the subshell will not be seen by the main shell.

Using `readlink -n` is definitely not "the right thing". However:
a. Using it makes a symlink work, *provided* it is a full path symlink (and there are no recursive symlinks, etc)
b. One way to properly expand the symlink is using `readlink -f`. That was proposed as a fix for #5852, it was applied, and later unapplied because using fully canonicalized paths causes other issues with doctesting. It just happens that using `readlink -n` is a middle-ground that works in some cases but using `readlink -f` exposes the doctesting issue in some common installs.

Thus, removing the use of `readlink -n` will break some common usage while not fixing anything. Replacing it by `readlink -f` fixes the canonicalization issue but will cause a regression by exposing a bug the way doctesting detects library code (see #5852 comment 12).

Additional remark: note that using `readlink -f` is not completely portable; neither is using `realpath`. Using both covers a majority of systems but not all of them. A more portable solution was proposed in #6146 but it doesn't make sense to push it until #5852 is resolved.

The common usage I refer to is the following:

1. I install sage x.y in a directory `~/sage/sage-x.y`
2. I make a symlink `~/bin/sage -> ~/sage/sage-x.y/sage` so that the sage command is available in my path [note the full path symlink].

This works fine right now, and would break if you remove "readlink -n".

----

NOTE: When "~/bin/sage" is a symlink with a relative path symlink, this doesn't work, and "readlink -f" would work. However, this leads to other breakup (this is the reason why #5852 was reverted and #6146 was not developed further). If you want to fix this you should start with #5852 (comment 12).

It is not immediately clear why using `pwd -P`, which fully expands symbolic links, and therefore would canonicalize `$SAGE_ROOT` as well, should break doctesting.

Even if it did somehow, this should be addressed in the corresponding scripts, `sage-{test,ptest,doctest}`, which are currently under work anyway, and have certainly changed since #5852 was opened (or last modified).

> It is not immediately clear why using `pwd -P`, which fully expands symbolic links, and therefore would canonicalize `$SAGE_ROOT` as well, should break doctesting.

The issue is described in comment:ticket:5852:12. Summary:

- there's a symlink `/home/wstein/sage-build -> /tmp/wstein`
- sage is untarred and compiled inside `/home/wstein/sage-build/sage-x.y/`
- doctesting as `sage -t /home/wstein/sage-x.y/...`

The last step fails if SAGE_ROOT is fully canonicalized to `/tmp/wstein/sage-x.y/...` because in that case the doctesting code didn't realize `/home/wstein/sage-x.y/...` is library code. IOW, that workflow worked for William *because* canonicalization was broken!

I presume the fix is that the comparision done for detecting library code be done with using canonical paths, etc.


> Even if it did somehow, this should be addressed in the corresponding scripts, `sage-{test,ptest,doctest}`, which are currently under work anyway, and have certainly changed since #5852 was opened (or last modified).

I agree. I haven't followed the development of these scripts, so I wouldn't know if the issue was addressed or not. If it is fixed, then #5852 can be reapplied and then #6164 can easily be turned into a patch that extends canonicalization to other systems where readlink -f is not available.

I don't think we should make "readlink -f" work when available.  I think either your or my bash script should do the job without making any assumptions on availability of `realpath` or `readlink -f`.
