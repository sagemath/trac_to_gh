# Issue 24113: SageObject.__repr__(): fall back to base class

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-12-08 20:57:11

`SageObject.__repr__(self)` tries to call `self._repr_()`. If that method does not exist, it confusingly fall back to returning `str(type(self))`. Instead, it would be better to fall back to `super().__repr__()`.

It took me a moment to realize why the current behavior is wrong (or at least highly misleading), but once I did, this is definitely what should be done. Positive review if the patchbot comes back green.

Indeed. It's also the kind of thing where you wonder why nobody noticed this before...

The old behaviour dates back to

I accidentally hard-coded the Sage version number in a few doctests. Last commit needs review.
