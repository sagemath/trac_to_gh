Yes, it is indeed a nice result. I have learned that from a recent talk of Gaifullin, that has just found a minimal triangulation of OP2.

Well, maybe one could just put a deprecated alias in the catalog of examples. Putting an alias for a short time is not really an option, as the rule is to wait one year after the next release after the ticket.
