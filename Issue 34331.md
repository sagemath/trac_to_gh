as this has been proved by Gorodkov in 2016 to be indeed the projective plane over H

should be an easy review ; I am not sure it is worth deprecating the old name

Thank you for discovering Gorodkov's result! The deprecation question is the only thing worth worrying about. It would be safest to deprecate the name, and then follow up pretty quickly and delete it. (I feel like some of our deprecation warnings linger for a while, but this one should definitely be short-lived.)

I could also be convinced that we don't need to deprecate it but just delete it. I do not expect that there are many people using this in their code, and it is easy to find the new command.

Yes, it is indeed a nice result. I have learned that from a recent talk of Gaifullin, that has just found a minimal triangulation of OP2.

Well, maybe one could just put a deprecated alias in the catalog of examples. Putting an alias for a short time is not really an option, as the rule is to wait one year after the next release after the ticket.
