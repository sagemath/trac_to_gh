Leif mentioned on sage-devel:


```
3) Probably disable the color mode. 
```


I'm not sure what he means with that, but just typing ```%colors NoColor``` after the weird sage prompt doesn't help.

Here's a simple change that enables "simple prompts" when sage is run within an Emacs inferior shell. 
However, as has been noted [here](http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24453/weird-shell-output-when-using-ipython-5), the "simple prompts" mode lacks multi-line support, so one gets this:

```

  File "<ipython-input-1-cde3fd95d55b>", line 1
    def f(x):
             ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

A few remarks :

* The [current patch](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit?id=92378caa0c1a030b9399e889f42edb5afc8c6d87) waits endlessly for a prompt.
* When interrupted (C-G), it gives a functional prompt : the Sage REPL is working.
* When inline plots are enabled, they are displayed, but the sustems claims (falsely) to have launced a png viewer.
* When tyepeset output is enabled in the menu, the output is displayed as text :

```
In [24]: integrate(arctan(x),x)


BEGIN_TEXT:x*arctan(x) - 1/2*log(x^2 + 1):END_TEXT
BEGIN_LATEX:\newcommand{\Bold}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}x \arctan\left(x\right) - \frac{1}{2} \, \log\left(x^{2} + 1\right):END_LATEX
```

* Ditto when using the `%display typeset` magic...

//"Oooohhh, so clooose..."//

Well, term-mode does not set `TERM=dumb`. It sets `TERM=eterm-color`. So?

What I'm saying is that:
- term-mode sets `TERM=eterm-color` and so, even with the patch on this ticket, no "simple prompts" are used.
- `comint-mode` does not handle escape sequences. Therefore it sets `TERM=dumb` to inform the applications running under it about this fact. 
- If your mode, derived from `comint-mode`, handles escape sequences, then it should not be using `TERM=dumb` but rather something else; perhaps `TERM=vt100`.

I did it (not quite sure yet whether I like Ubuntu 16.04...)

Anyway: `M-x sage-shell:run-sage` starts sage and I can evaluate stuff.

* I have no tab-completion (the modeline says: "No match")
* sending a buffer to the `*sage*` buffer breaks emacs `(Error running timer: (wrong-type-argument bufferp nil)` occupies the modeline and won't go away anymore.

I am using sage 7.4.beta1 with the patch on this ticket applied, emacs is 24.5.1.  Running `emacs -q` and then in `*scratch*`:

```
(require 'package)
package

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)
t
(setq sage-shell:use-prompt-toolkit 'T)
T
(setq sage-shell:sage-root "~/SAGE")
"~/SAGE"
```

and finally

```
M-x sage-shell:run-sage
```

gives

Wow!  I think you are getting very close!

* tab completion works
* sending a buffer with `C-c C-c` to the sage buffer works, also loading a file with `C-c C-l` works.
A little suggestion: if the current buffer is a visited file in sage mode, it would be nice to have `C-c C-c` load the file instead, asking whether to save the buffer if necessary.  Because:

```
sage: load('/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.sage')
```

doesn't give me a clue which file I actually loaded!

* unfortunately, sending a line to sage does not work correctly:

```
sage: load('/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.py')
  File "/tmp/sage_shell_mode17030j9Q/sage_shell_mode_temp.py", line 3

I think it doesn't strip the "sage:" anymore - was this done by ipython before?

Thank you for trying.

To fix this issue, I had to changed basic functions of this mode. So there may be such problems. Sorry.

Another tiny problem: saying

```
(sage-shell:define-alias)
```

in `.emacs` doesn't work - must it be in `.emacs.d/init.el`?

To do this, `sage-shell-mode` has to renamed to `sage-mode` or `sage`. This is convention of elisp.

> given that sage-mode is unlikely to be resurrected

If mkoeppe's request to `prompt_toolkit` is accepted, `sage-mode` will be resurrected. So concerning with alias or renaming, I will see how it goes for a while.

Sorry, I was unclear.  What I meant is: without the aliases it's terrible, and it's easier for the user if she doesn't need to modify `.emacs`.  But it's only a suggestion, personally I have no problem.  Indeed, I am very happy.  (special thanks for `send-doctest`, which I immediately bound to `C-c C-j` :-)

I've actually created a new ticket #21558 for that purpose. 
So it's OK with me if the present ticket is closed when items 1--3 are done.
