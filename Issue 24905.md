# Issue 24905: Add DESTDIR support for zlib

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25142

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-11 11:02:28

Keywords: destdir zlib

Implements #24024 for zlib.  This was actually rather straightforward--although zlib has a hand-written configure script, it seems to be fully compatible with one generated by autoconf.

Looks good to me. Feel free to set to positive review if you are confident that this still works.

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.
