Include the CM library (http://cm.multiprecision.org) as an optional spkg.

An spkg is available at http://www.infres.enst.fr/~flori/ecc2011/cm-0.1.spkg (or http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~flori/ecc2011/cm-0.1.spkg).

IIRC Robert B. suggested to give the [s]package a more meaningful name...

You're right.

Would complex_multiplication be a better choice ?

Hmmm, lengthy, but doesn't tell much more what the library is for.

Perhaps just prefix "cm" with something to disambiguate it?

Although "mp-cm" wouldn't be much better.

Robert, any suggestions?

Oh, "mp-cm" for example would currently have to be "mp_cm", since others objected to support typical package names (which _do_ include dashs) in Sage... ;-)

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
