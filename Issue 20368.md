I think because of how important the integers and rationals are, I think we should try a little bit harder to have the examples be somewhat clean. As such, I would propose this change to all similar doctests:

```diff
-    sage: a = Z(1234); b = Z(5678); a, b
-    (1234, 5678)
+    sage: a = Z(1234); a
+    1234
+    sage: b = Z(5678); b
+    5678
```

All of the other changes LGTM.
