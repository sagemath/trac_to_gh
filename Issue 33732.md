A couple of wrappers for link properties listed in the  [KnotInfo](https://knotinfo.math.indiana.edu/) and [LinkInfo](https://linkinfo.sitehost.iu.edu/) databases have already been implemented in #30352. But since there are more than 120 of them there are still a lot missing. Here we add missing polynomial link invariants, explicitly the Conway and Khovanov polynomials.

Furthermore we let Sage point to the current version of [database_knotinfo](https://pypi.org/project/database-knotinfo/).
