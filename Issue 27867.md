CC:  jpflori

On some arch openblas fails to select a sgemm kernel implementation:

```
gcc -O2 -DMAX_STACK_ALLOC=2048 -Wall -m64 -DF_INTERFACE_GFORT -fPIC -DNO_AVX512 -DNO_WARMUP -DMAX_CPU_NUMBER=1 -DMAX_PARALLEL_NUMBER=1 -DUSE_TLS -DVERSION=\"0.3.6\" -DASMNAME=sgemm_kernel -DASMFNAME=sgemm_kernel_ -DNAME=sgemm_kernel_ -DCNAME=sgemm_kernel -DCHAR_NAME=\"sgemm_kernel_\" -DCHAR_CNAME=\"sgemm_kernel\" -DNO_AFFINITY -I.. -UDOUBLE  -UCOMPLEX -c -UDOUBLE -UCOMPLEX ../kernel/x86_64/ -o sgemm_kernel.o
gcc: warning: ../kernel/x86_64/: linker input file unused because linking not done
}}
Should have been `../kernel/x86_64/<implementation>.c`
