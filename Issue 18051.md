# Issue 18051: Bad from __future__ import in sage-CSI-helper.py

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-04-23 12:25:27

The typical `gdb` backtrace using `sage-CSI-helper.py` got broken in #17776:

```
  File "<string>", line 4
SyntaxError: from __future__ imports must occur at the beginning of the file
Error while executing Python code.
```


The issue here is that the script is read and not just executed.

Gdb can also be built with python 3 afaik. We should just delete the future import, print-as-a-function works also without it.

Replying to [comment:3 vbraun]:
> print-as-a-function works also without it.
Not in this case:

```
  File "<string>", line 78
    .format(index, func_address, func_name, a), end=' ')
                                                   ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

True, though one could just adjust the print call at that point to work in both py2 & 3
