#18459 was just an update. It had nothing to do with the package type (experimental/optional/standard). Surely 4ti2 has been around for long enough to become optional or standard. There was a massive patch setting package types:


```
>build/pkgs/4ti2$ git blame type
ef11087e (Jeroen Demeyer 2015-06-01 10:12:49 +0200 1) experimental
```


We should hold a vote on sage-devel to promote it to optional. (For this it must not fail any tests, etc).

You can setup a vote if you prefer, but I do not remember it being mandatory for a new optional package. It was only switched to experimental because it did not pass all optional tests at that time.

OK, then how about flipping type to 'optional' and proceeding?

otherwise, looks good to me. To allow bots to test this properly, commit the change of type, please.

Indeed. So make absolutely sure that the optional tests pass.
