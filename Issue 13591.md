At Linux root can say

shutdown -r 10 mins "Kernel will be updated, please log out"

to notify command line users. Could sage-nb have something similar? After command only admin could log in (and front page would show short message given by admin), and already logged users would get warning to their running notebooks.

As SageNB is not going to be developed any more, I suggest closing this ticket.
