Hi Andrey,

the patch looks good to me. I've made a trivial change (added a 'the') and will set this to positive review.

Thank you! "the" was indeed important since otherwise the phrase is obviously ambiguous - the plan was to talk about the polyhedron that is used to truncate the plot, not some other one which is truncated.
