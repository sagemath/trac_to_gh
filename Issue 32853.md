# Issue 32853: Cygwin install breaks on lcalc-2.0.4

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33090

Original creator: @darijgr

Original creation time: 2021-12-28 15:16:53

Keywords: cygwin, cygwin64, lcalc, compile

Here is what I think is the relevant stderr output:

```
[lcalc-2.0.4] /usr/bin/bash ../../libtool  --tag=CXX   --mode=link g++ -std=gnu++11  -g -O2 -version-info 1:1:0 -L/home/skraeling/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/skraeling/sage/local/lib -L/home/skraeling/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/skraeling/sage/local/lib  -o libLfunction.la -rpath /home/skraeling/sage/local/lib Ldokchitser.lo Lelliptic.lo Lgamma.lo Lglobals.lo Lmisc.lo Lnumbertheory.lo Lriemannsiegel.lo   -lpari
[lcalc-2.0.4] libtool:   error: can't build x86_64-pc-cygwin shared library unless -no-undefined is specified
[lcalc-2.0.4] make[6]: *** [Makefile:472: libLfunction.la] Error 1
[lcalc-2.0.4] make[5]: *** [Makefile:476: all-recursive] Error 1
```


I assume this is a matter of correctly invoking the linker; I'll try https://stackoverflow.com/a/69219756/ once some other packages have compiled (I'm compiling in parallel).
