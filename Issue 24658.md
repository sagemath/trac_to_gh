I'm slight curious how you catch these. I'm guessing you run the doc through a spell-checker that has a bunch of math words in its dictionary? Anyways, LGTM.

Sadly, I am doing that purely by hand, using only things like

```
egrep -R -w --no-filename -o 'ori[a-z]+' src/sage | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

and staring at the output.
