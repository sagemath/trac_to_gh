Jeroen or Travis, could you please help to fix the pickling issue arising here ?

I had to change some classes from old-style classes to SageObject classes in order to benefit from the new `@richcmp_method` decorator. This breaks the pickles, but I do not known how to fix that.

See patchbot report for the exact doctest failure.

Maybe this is not the only issue with the branch.

I think there might be two issues here. The `H == loads(dumps(H))` might be exposing something with the decorator not being well-behaved wrt pickling. The second might be due to old-style vs new-style classes, but IDK without doing a much deeper investigation than I have time ATM.

Side comment: in `HeckeOperator`, the check

```
if not isinstance(other, HeckeOperator):
```
seems superfluous now because the coercion framework should make them have the same parent, and hence, the same element class (at least if it is a proper, well-behaved parent).

What do you mean with this? There is nothing in the coercion framework which says that "equal parents" should imply "equal Python classes". For *most* parents, this implication happens to be true, but it's not a general rule.

I'm going to use a cop-out and say "well-behaved" `:P`, but yes, fair point. There is also the fact that the Hecke algebra here bypasses the usual coercion and implements its own custom `__call__`. So, we do need to keep the extra type checking and handling by `_richcmp_`.

I fixed the failing doctest and made the suggested changes (using `NotImplemented`).

There remains the 3 pickling problems, namely in

```
sage -t --long src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx
```
and more precisely (see patchbot reports for more details):

```
    Failed:
    _class__sage_modular_modform_cuspidal_submodule_CuspidalSubmodule_g1_Q__.sobj
    _class__sage_modular_modsym_manin_symbols_ManinSymbolList_gamma1__.sobj
    _class__sage_modular_modsym_manin_symbols_ManinSymbolList_gamma_h__.sobj
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ** This error is probably due to an old pickle failing to unpickle.
    ** See sage.structure.sage_object.register_unpickle_override for
    ** how to override the default unpickling methods for (old) pickles.
    ** NOTE: pickles should never be removed from the pickle_jar! 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Successfully unpickled 583 objects.
    Failed to unpickle 3 objects.
```
Please help to fix that, because I am not able to.

This is a solution, but IMO it is a complete hack solution. I suspect the issues comes from the fact that the base class is now `SageObject` versus a old-style Python class:

```python
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self, x):
....:         self._x = x
....:     def __eq__(self, other):
....:         return self._x == other._x
sage: F = Foo(5)
sage: F.__class__.__mro__
(<class '__main__.Foo'>, <type 'object'>)
sage: class Foo:
...
sage: F = Foo(5)
sage: F.__class__.__mro__
...
AttributeError: class Foo has no attribute '__mro__'
```
However, I'm not sure exactly how to fix this. Have you tried implementing a custom `__setstate__`?

One way to get around this should be to use a function as the unpickle override, but IIRC, classes need to go to classes, so I think this ends up not working. Yet, there is a close variant of this approach that has a simple target class with a `__setstate__`, that when called and the unpickling is done, it then sets the `self.__class__ = Foo`. I believe this is done somewhere in the codebase...

Okay, so how pickles are created for old-style classes is quite different than for new-style:

```
sage: class Foo:
....:     def __init__(self, x):
....:         self._x = x
sage: F = Foo(5)
sage: p = dumps(F)
sage: explain_pickle(p)
pg_Foo = unpickle_global('__main__', 'Foo')
pg = unpickle_instantiate(pg_Foo, ())
pg_make_integer = unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'make_integer')
unpickle_build(pg, {'_x':pg_make_integer('5')})
pg
sage: loads(p)._x
5
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     def __init__(self, x=None):
....:         self._x = x
....:     def __setstate__(self, state):
....:         print(state)
....:         self._x = state['_x']
sage: loads(p)._x
('__init__', None)
{'_x': 5}
5
sage: explain_pickle(dumps(Foo(5)))
pg_Foo = unpickle_global('__main__', 'Foo')
si = unpickle_newobj(pg_Foo, ())
pg_make_integer = unpickle_global('sage.rings.integer', 'make_integer')
unpickle_build(si, {'_x':pg_make_integer('5')})
si
sage: loads(dumps(Foo(5)))._x
('__init__', 5)
{'_x': 5}
5
```
So all of the `__setstate__` logic happens **after** the `__init__` call, which makes it essentially useless for our purpose.

My solution is similar to the `SkewTableau` case, where there is a little dummy class that inherits from the main class `G1list` that just exists to handle pickles and sets its `__class__` to the base class upon `__init__`. This is a little elegant, a little hackish, but it works.

No problem. I'm sorry I didn't have more time to actually sit down and fix it rather than lobbing ideas over.

One other detail, we should add a test in the `__init__` of those classes to make sure the pickling is happening correctly for the new objects. Something like:

```
sage: from sage.modular.modsym.g1list import G1list
sage: L = G1list(6)
sage: Lp = loads(dumps(L))
sage: L == Lp
True
sage: type(Lp) == G1list
True
```
Feel free to add after the patchbot run.
