This ticket adds the crown poset.

Trivial, except the name: I think `posets.Crown(...)` is enought, but should it be `posets.CrownPoset(...)`?

I think the docstring would be more clear as

```
        In this poset every element `i` for `0 \leq i \leq n-1`
        is covered by elements `i+n` and `i+n+1`, except that
        `n-1` is covered by `n` and `n+1`.

Also, I think

```diff
-sage: Posets.crown(3)
