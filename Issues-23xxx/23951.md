The definitions of `GrowthDiagram.rotate` and `GrowthDiagram.conjugate` did not take the shape and the in-labels into account.

In the case of `GrowthDiagram.rotate` the in-labels must be ignored - this is what's needed in practise and there is no natural way to do anything else.  But in the case of `GrowthDiagram.conjugate`, they must not be ignored...
