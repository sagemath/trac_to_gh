sage: edgelist = [(0,0,'a'), (0,1,'b'), (1,1,'c')]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: G.merge_vertices([0,1]); G.edges()

```

It looks like merge_vertices() works by computing the edge boundary between the specified set of vertices and the rest of the graph, then deleting all the vertices except the first one, then putting the edges back in.

So there are actually two issues here. (1) Loops not on the first vertex will be lost (because they're not in the edge boundary and their vertices get deleted), and (2) we'll lose other edges that are not in the edge boundary so they should become loops.

(1) is certainly a defect. I'm not so certain about (2) because I don't know if it's appropriate for this method to create loops. In fact, it's probably not.

Nevermind. A user may wish to input `None` as the first item in the list because this will give the merged vertex a new name.

Is this faster because it specifies the vertices, rather than iterating over a list of edges to get the loops?

It's an undocumented feature that `None` as the first entry will give the vertex a new name, and a bug that it will create a new vertex if there's nothing to merge. I'll addressed both.

Is there a guide where I can see how to correctly mark up documentation? The developer's guide doesn't seem to cover it all, and many of the other methods I've looked at use `TESTS::` and not `TESTS:`. This doesn't seem to be a standard thing for Python docstrings so I'm not sure where to look.

The `loop_edges` method calls the `loop_vertices` method which returns `[v for v in self if self.has_edge(v,v)]` if loops are allowed.

Since `vertices` is a subset of the vertices of the graph, and we can expect this set to be small most of the time (e.g., 2), what I propose should be faster than your first proposal.

It's documented in the method, 3rd paragraph: `The new vertex is named after the first vertex in the list given in argument. If this first name is None, a new vertex is created.`

To be honest, I don't know. I checked on recent ticket, and #23255 suggests that `TESTS::` is the good form. So keep it as is.

Judging from that ticket, the convention is to use `::` when `sage:` follows and `:` when text follows. So in this instance, I should indeed use `TESTS:`. The usage isn't consistent throughout the file but I'm not going to try and fix it within this ticket.

I made the changes you suggested, but I had to change one of the tests:

```
sage: edgelist = [(0,0,'a'),(0,1,'b'),(1,1,'c'), (1, 2, 'd'), (2, 2, 'e')]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=False)
sage: G.merge_vertices([0,1,2]); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 'e')]
sage: G = Graph(edgelist, loops=True, multiedges=False)
sage: G.merge_vertices([0,2,1]); G.edges()
[(0, 0, 'e')]
```

I think the last output should be `[(0, 0, 'c')]`, and that's what the code currently returns, since it evaluates vertex `1` last and finds the label `'c'` last.
