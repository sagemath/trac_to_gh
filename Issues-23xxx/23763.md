Dear Prof Chapoton,

Thank you very much for the code, and for notifying us on the other ticket. Is it possible to code the dual algebra too (maybe using some standard code for dualising combinatorial Hopf algebras)?

Also two questions about using the code:
1. Is it possible to ask Sage to produce a list of the planar binary trees of degree n (in order to make matrices for the product, coproduct etc.)?
2. How do I input a particular tree? In your examples I see only 

```
 sage: x = RT([], '@')
```
which creates the element in degree 1.


Thank you very much.

Amy

`sage: list(BinaryTrees(4))`

but beware that you need to use the unlabelled version

`sage: algebras.FreeDendriform(QQ,1)`

We currently have no way to list the labelled trees.

There are many ways. Here is my favorite one:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.abstract_tree import from_hexacode
sage: RT = BinaryTrees()
sage: t = from_hexacode('2022000', RT); t
[[., .], [[[., .], [., .]], [., .]]]
sage: %display unicode_art
sage: t

  __o___
 ╱      ╲
o       _o_
       ╱   ╲
      o     o
     ╱ ╲    
    o   o   
```
The word given as input is the list of valences of vertices, read in the recursive order (root, word for left subtree, word for right subtree). I hope it's clear ?
