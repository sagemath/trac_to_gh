Yes, the order of the output has no significance and to my understanding can change from version to version of normaliz.

I also just verified experimentally that the doctests are stable within a version by running:

```
./sage -t --file-iterations=100 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py
```

so I agree with Jeroen that his branch solves the main problem of this ticket, namely make the results of the patchbot reliable again. So positive review from me.

I understand that having doctests pass for multiple normaliz versions is something nice to have since it makes it easier to upgrade normaliz. But let's fix that problem for during the next upgrade of normaliz and not waste any more time on this ticket so that we can get consistent patchbot behaviour again.
