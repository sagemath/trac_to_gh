That's actually not bad at all. There are many doctests which depend on the *version* of a package. If the output is consistent for any given version, it is fine to put that output in the doctest.

I also just verified experimentally that the doctests are stable within a version by running:

```

so I agree with Jeroen that his branch solves the main problem of this ticket, namely make the results of the patchbot reliable again. So positive review from me.
