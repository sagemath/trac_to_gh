That's actually not bad at all. There are many doctests which depend on the *version* of a package. If the output is consistent for any given version, it is fine to put that output in the doctest.

I understand that having doctests pass for multiple normaliz versions is something nice to have since it makes it easier to upgrade normaliz. But let's fix that problem for during the next upgrade of normaliz and not waste any more time on this ticket so that we can get consistent patchbot behaviour again.
