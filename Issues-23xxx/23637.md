Yes, the order of the output has no significance and to my understanding can change from version to version of normaliz.
I used `set(...)` in the doctest, based on the misconception that this is the correct idiom. I now understand that I should have used `sorted(...)` instead. I do not agree with the current patch, which just uses the unsorted output as is.

That's actually not bad at all. There are many doctests which depend on the *version* of a package. If the output is consistent for any given version, it is fine to put that output in the doctest.

I understand that having doctests pass for multiple normaliz versions is something nice to have since it makes it easier to upgrade normaliz.
