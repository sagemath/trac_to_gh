> I believe it uses sets because there is no (natural) ordering on that output. However, I do not know if normaliz and our code has any guarantee on the output order. Maybe Matthias can comment more on this.


Yes, the order of the output has no significance and to my understanding can change from version to version of normaliz.
I used `set(...)` in the doctest, based on the misconception that this is the correct idiom. I now understand that I should have used `sorted(...)` instead. I do not agree with the current patch, which just uses the unsorted output as is.
