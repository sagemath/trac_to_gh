A couple more quick changes:

In the following, Where should be When:

```
Returns a tuple of two polynomials `(n, d)` where ``self`` `* d` is congruent to `n` modulo `m`.  

Where `\deg(n) \leq n_deg` and `\deg(d) \leq d_deg`, the default value of `n_deg` and `d_deg` is `floor(\deg(m) - 1)/2)`.}}}


Also, in the documentation you need an empty line after each ::

Finally, it could be rebased on the newest development branch.  

I'm currently applying and playing with the code.
