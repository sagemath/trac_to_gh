sage: X = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [])
sage: Y = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: Hom(X,Y).zero().matrix()
[]
sage: Hom(X,Y).zero().matrix().parent()
Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 dense matrices over Rational Field
```
The result should be a 3x0 matrix. We need to explicitly compute the dimension of the codomain and pass that to the matrix constructor.
