<a id='comment:11'></a>I am making some style changes. I am still working on this, but here are already some comments.

Please fix/comment the following:

* I guess you want to make this more accessible than `from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface`?
* Why so much precision in the examples? Having 200 bits of precision seems like a lot. I tried a couple of the examples with less precision and found the output much easier to parse.
* `TODO: have an example where self.genus < 0 to raise error`
* Comment on the constant 100 in `_determine_new_w` and `_newton_iteration` (nothing fancy necessary, just say that this is a random bound that worked well in practice?)
* In `period_matrix`: `Computes the period matrix of f given the homology basis and cohomology basis.` What is "given" here?
* Why do you perform your own caching in `period_matrix` (`self._PM`) and `riemann_matrix` (`self._RM`), `cohomology_basis` (`self._differentials`) ?
* The `self._differentials[1]` is very confusing. Why do you need it?
* `raise ValueError('Length of differentials list is not equal to genus.')` should this not be a `NotImplementedError`?
* Does `simple_vector_line_integral` require a previous call to `cohomology_basis` to work? (The docstring makes it seem so.) If this is the case, then the method should probably not be public. In other words, the `NOTE` there is confusing.
* The `if/else` in `homology_basis`…could you add a comment on why you can be sure that `cds[0] != cds[1]`? If this could go wrong in low precision, you might want to replace the assert with something else.
* Should `RiemannSurface` really be an `object` and not at least a `SageObject`? You could probably add a comment about why this is not a scheme in the hierarchy of the namespace there.

There are some confusing comments in the source code, please try to make them more understandable to people who did not write this code:

```       
# Using singular to compute the genus quickly. Later, use rank/2 of
        # gram matrix?
```
 
```
        # TODO: can we get rid of the comments below?
        # I'm not sure if this check will work, but could be useful?
        # I think singular's genus computation returns a negative genus
        # if it's reducible. Either way, if the genus is negative we should
        # terminate.
```

`#TODO: Why not make a list in the first place with the edges?`

```
        #mt = Matrix(ZZ,[[1 if i==j else 0 for j in range(4*g**2)] +
        #  [((S*w.monomial_coefficient(vars[i]).real_part()).round() for w in W] +
        #  [S*w.monomial_coefficient(vars[i]).imag_part()).round() for w in W] for i in range(len(vars))])

> I am making some style changes.


Thank you for style formatting!

> * I guess you want to make this more accessible than `from sage.schemes.riemann_surfaces.riemann_surface import RiemannSurface`?


Probably affine and projective plane curves will eventually grow a method "riemann_surface", so I don't think accessibility is an issue. `RiemannSurface` can mean more than just a compact one, so I'd be careful exposing it in the global namespace for that reason under that name (and other names get unappetizing pretty quickly)

> * Why so much precision in the examples? Having 200 bits of precision seems like a lot. I tried a couple of the examples with less precision and found the output much easier to parse.


Turned it back a little

> * `TODO: have an example where self.genus < 0 to raise error`


Removed it. Actually, surfaces with multiple components shouldn't be an issue. The singular backend doesn't like them, though.

> * Comment on the constant 100 in `_determine_new_w` and `_newton_iteration` (nothing fancy necessary, just say that this is a random bound that worked well in practice?)


Done. This will never be triggered in practice.

> * In `period_matrix`: `Computes the period matrix of f given the homology basis and cohomology basis.` What is "given" here?


Fixed

> * Why do you perform your own caching in `period_matrix` (`self._PM`) and `riemann_matrix` (`self._RM`),


We did this to accommodate for the different options in the cohomology basis. However, in practice nobody would change that, and in actuality there's a benefit in providing the user a hook to specify this him/herself. This is implemented now, so the period matrix can now be cached in a vanilla way (and the riemann matrix is easily derived, so doesn't need to be cached)

> `cohomology_basis` (`self._differentials`) ?


That's because the attribute can be specified in multiple ways.

> * The `self._differentials[1]` is very confusing. Why do you need it?


Removed now, in favour of a user-configurable "differentials" value.

> * `raise ValueError('Length of differentials list is not equal to genus.')` should this not be a `NotImplementedError`?


No, that's an error. "Genus" here should be H<sup>0(k,Omega</sup>1_S). Thus the genus of the union of two elliptic curves should be 2.

> * Does `simple_vector_line_integral` require a previous call to `cohomology_basis` to work? (The docstring makes it seem so.) If this is the case, then the method should probably not be public. In other words, the `NOTE` there is confusing.


No, it's a useful routine in general, but it does need stuff preinitialized (you'll get an error otherwise, no incorrect results). It's pretty inner-loop otherwise, so it shouldn't be weighed down with an expensive call to homology_basis.

> * The `if/else` in `homology_basis`…could you add a comment on why you can be sure that `cds[0] != cds[1]`? If this could go wrong in low precision, you might want to replace the assert with something else.


There are much worse ways in which that code can fail than the assert. I don't think it's worth worrying about.

> * Should `RiemannSurface` really be an `object` and not at least a `SageObject`?


I don't see a benefit from making it a `SageObject`. I don't see how this object would benefit from interacting more closely with sage objects. It's just a container to spit out Riemann matrices.

> You could probably add a comment about why this is not a scheme in the hierarchy of the namespace there.


I don't think I have a comment on that.
