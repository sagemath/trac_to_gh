Calculating the span of a large number of vectors in a high-dimension vector space over GF(2) has gotten a lot slower in recent versions of sage. This can be demonstrated by the following code:

```
import time

set_random_seed(0)
n = 1000
v = [ random_vector(GF(2), n) for i in xrange(n) ]

c1 = time.clock()
span(v, GF(2))
print time.clock()-c1
```

In Sage 7.4, this took around ~0.7s (on my laptop), whereas in Sage 8.0, it takes ~12s. This performance regression was introduced by #21746. The reason is that the new logic in `Vector_mod2_dense.__init__()` ends up calculating the modulus of an IntegerMod_int object rather than a native C int, which turns out to be a lot slower. Profiling the above code reveals that in Sage 8.0 it indeed spends most of its time in `IntegerMod_int.__mod__`.

The fix I uploaded sidesteps the problem by converting an IntegerMod_int object to a Python int first before taking the modulus, restoring the original performance. A better solution might be to make `IntegerMod_int.__mod__()` faster.

The import should not be done inside of the method. Is `R.order()` not the same as `modulus`? But in any case, I do think that using the modulus of a native C int should be used.
