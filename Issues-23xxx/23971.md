```
The result of a `//` should remain in the same ring, but it currently does not:

```
sage: (GaussianIntegers()(1)//1).parent()
Number Field in I with defining polynomial x^2 + 1
```

This is caused by order elements inheriting from `FieldElement` which makes the assumption that `_floordiv_` and `_div_` are the same.

This is tricky, since most orders in number fields are not Euclidean, so quotient with remainder doesn't make sense.

There are other orders which are norm Euclidean (some real quadratic orders for example).  See http://www.fen.bilkent.edu.tr/~franz/publ/survey.pdf

Of course, it's computationally more difficult to find a remainder when the unit group is nontrivial.

First, the patchbot is unhappy: there's a strange merge failure on Cygwin, complaining about `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/sage/parallel/map_reduce.py` (which I don't understand, since other merges into `8.1.beta8` succeeded), and a test failure in `sage/structure/element.pyx`.

Some thoughts on the code:

* Julian suggested having `a//b` return `parent(a/b)` when b divides `a` and raise an error otherwise.  This makes sense for any integral domain, and I think it's a good idea: so often this is what we want for floor division.  It's a bit strange to have different behavior for different `b`, but we already do this to some extent: `b=0` will always raise an error.

* Why did you choose to round to even?  It would be more consistent with `QQ` to round down.

* I think we should also implement `__mod__` and `quo_rem` to match this implementation of floor division.  This doesn't have to be on this ticket.

Consistency with `QQ` was not a goal here. I guess it could be done but then it becomes less obvious to generalize to all number field elements. You cannot just round down the first component (the `x` in `x + y sqrt(D)`) in all cases. So either we would need to round down `x` only when `y` is zero or an integer, but that seems like needless complication to me.

Besides, I like the idea that `x // y` gives the closest possible order element to `x / y`.

Say `a` and `b` both have an order `R` as their parent.  I meant that `a//b` should return `R(a/b)`.

This ticket was originally not only about quadratic imaginary orders (I think you changed the scope at some point.) I think that `a//b` should always return `a/b` if that is in the original ring…I really just want `a//1` not to fail.
