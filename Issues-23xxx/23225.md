see the last comments on #18882

There are a wrong `ASSERT` in `toom2.c` that errors out on some systems. In addition, tuning routine may link against a wrong copy of `libgf2x.so`.

Hi,

I'm reviewing the suggested changes to gf2x in order to prepare a release.

Several issues were raised in #18882.

I don't see the point about shared libs possibly linking to an outdated version. I haven't witnessed that. If I install some libgf2x.so in the library path (say, in /usr/local), then we have the following.

On the one hand, it's true that "ldd ./src/.libs/tunetoom" sees the /usr/local library as a way to resolve the dependency:

```
  libgf2x.so.1 => /usr/local/lib/libgf2x.so.1
```

On the other hand, the above is a non-issue, because in the testing procedure, libtool takes care of ensuring that the libgf2x which gets linked is the right one. I check that with

```
  cat /proc/`pidof tunetoom`/maps
```
while tunetoom is running. It does use the one in the build tree, not the /usr/local one.

Is there something else that I've missed in the way you encounter a misbehaviour ?

Maybe this only works when you have something in a system path; in my case I did see this wrong linking to SAGE_LOCAL/lib/libgf2x.so.1
rather than to the libgf2x.so.1 currently being built.

It may also be that FreeBSD's linker behaves differently and does the wrong linking regardless...

Anyway, I would be happy to test a newer version of gf2x on FreeBSD, if you don't have access to such a system.
I have just updated the relevant ticket #22679.

libtool is smart enough to use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OS X, so that's OK. But freeBSD is an unknown, I don't know if it support any mechanism of that kind.

It's hard to work with maybe's...

I can test the following.
1. install some gf2x in a system path
2. run gf2x tuning from a fresh tarball
3. make sure the tuning does not use the lib from step 1.

I can also replace step 1. by "install some gf2x in a custom path, and enable its use via LD_LIBRARY_PATH".

I can do this test on various machines. I understand you've seen issues on freebsd, I can do a test on freebsd 11.0.

I can also test on macosx 11.0

However if the procedure that led you to a misbehaviour is not within the scope of what I will be testing, chances are that I'm not going to detect anything wrong.

Would you mind being more precise about what you mean by "a problem" ?

AFAIK OSX uses DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. And so what ?

It should not be within the scope of a package I write to deal with the idiosyncrasies of all unices on earth. Libtool is for that, and precisely for that.


> libtool is smart enough to use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on OS X, so that's OK. But freeBSD is an unknown, I don't know if it support any mechanism of that kind.

Yup.

It's certainly not as if freeBSD was a new kid on the block, you know... That it would be "unsupported" by libtool in some way would surprise me very much.

I presume that by `3.` you mean "break the installed gf2x, so that tuning---if it uses it---will fail".

Yes, please test on FreeBSD 11.0 with CC=clang and CXX=clang++
(I think I saw this with clang version 4.0.0; probably the current (3.8.0) would reproduce this too).

And also note that I am talking about gf2x-1.1. I did not try the development version yet.

I knew about OSX preventing gdb for non-root users. Now LD_LIBRARY_PATH. What next ?

Basically, I was changing the tuning code and not seeing any difference, until I checked the tuning routine with `ldd` and saw it linking to the wrong copy of the dynamic library.

Sorry for noise---no need to run any "live" tests, just build and check with ldd that `lt-tunetoom` is linked against the right library.

You're tinkering with libtool's internals, there. Theoretically, libtool's wrapper could wrap the final executable in such a way that the library paths you see with ldd on .libs/blah are irrelevant.

This being said, I've been able to reproduce your freebsd problem. I'll look into it a bit more.

So. This "tuning hits the wrong library" issue is a libtool bug IMHO.

I've committed a workaround to gf2x, but the cause of the misbehaviour is completely unrelated to gf2x itself. If you follow that same procedure of leaving an installed lib, and try to run the tuning of e.g., gmp, then you'll be testing the old library just the same.

libtool bug reported there.

Would you mind testing whether the latest release candidate looks good to you?

The page with all released tarballs is there: 
https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=1874

rc1 did not live long, as Paul noticed a corner case.
