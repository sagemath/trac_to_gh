sage: P = PermutationGroup(['(1,2)','(1,3)'])
sage: P.cardinality()
6
sage: type(P.cardinality())
<type 'int'>
```
This prevents using the `.is_one()` method or any other `Integer` specific method.

The problem comes from the shortcuts implemented in the `_order` method.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Did you also check to see how

```python
        cycle_tuples = []
        for g in gens:
            temp = g.cycle_tuples()
            if len(temp) != 2:
                return None
            cycle_tuples.append(temp)
```
compares timing-wise? At least it seems like it would be faster...
