the majority of the code for working with arithmetical dynamical systems is in the respective morphism files in the sage/schemes folder. This is not very intuitive and as the code grows this is becoming increasing less ideal.

This ticket proposes creating a sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics folder to house the dynamical systems code. This includes creating a class to distinguish between SchemeMorphism_polynomials which happen to be endomorphisms and those which should be treated dynamical systems. I consider this extra class as the negative effect of moving the code.


There are really two main reasons for this move.

- the dynamical systems functionality is extensive enough that it should be separated from the schemes functionality.  There is already a sage/dynamics folders so it makes sense to put it there.

- creating a dynamical system under the new structure is much easier and intuitive for the user

I've acheived an initial move of the code that achieves 'all tests pass', so I figured that was a good place to commit and get another set of eyes on this.

There remains much clean-up to be done. A few things I haven't done yet

- do we need to specify domain=P to get point iteration to work? What works and what doesn't with the domains

- is .as_scheme_morphism and .as_dynamical_system a performance hit (and excess object creation in memory)? If so, what's a better way to deal with this (basically the parent of a dynamical system is the endomorphism ring of schemes which creates a schememorphism...)

-  dynamicalsystems_generic defaults to affine which probably should be projective

- some more intelligence in the creation functions

I consider this ready for a review now.

When we are happy with this new functionality, then we'll need to merge in the following tickets which will conflict: #23234, #23333, #23334. So don't mark it positive-reivew even if it is ready.

Comments. I'm sorry if some of this is coming from old code already in Sage, but this might be a good time to clean it if it does.

Can you explain a little more about what is in the description about the extra class and why it is necessary? I don't really know this code/math so much to fully understand.

Indentation here:

```
.. [FH2015]     \J. A. de Faria, B. Hutz. Combinatorics of Cycle Lengths on
            Wehler K3 Surfaces over finite fields. New Zealand Journal
            of Mathematics 45 (2015), 19–31.
```

Do you want to worry about backwards compatibility with imports?

```diff
-class DynamicalSystem_affine_ring(SchemeMorphism_polynomial_affine_space,\
-                             DynamicalSystem_generic):
+class DynamicalSystem_affine_ring(SchemeMorphism_polynomial_affine_space,
+                                  DynamicalSystem_generic):
```
and similar; in particular, you do not need the `\`.

```diff
     INPUT:
 
-    - ``polys_or_rat_fncts`` -- a list of ``n`` polynomials or rational
-      functions, all of which should have the same parent.
+      functions, all of which should have the same parent
-
-    - ``domain`` -- an affine scheme embedded in `\mathbb{A}^n`.
+    - ``domain`` -- an affine scheme embedded in `\mathbb{A}^n`
```

```diff
     def __init__(self, polys_or_rat_fncts, domain):
         r"""

         See :class:`DynamicalSystem_generic` for details.

-
-        - ``domain`` -- the domain of the map to be constructed.
-
-        OUTPUT:
-
-        - :class:`DynamicalSystem_affine`.
```

```diff
         INPUT:
 
-        - ``n`` -- a tuple of nonnegative integers. If ``n`` is an integer,
-          then the two values of the tuple are assumed to be the same.
+        - ``n`` -- a tuple of nonnegative integers; if ``n`` is an integer,
+          then the two values of the tuple are assumed to be the same
```
and similar changes.

```diff
+Return the ``n``-th iterate of self.
-Return the ``n``-th iterate of ``self``.
```

```diff
-       INPUT: ``n`` - a positive integer.
+       INPUT:
+
+       - ``n`` -- a positive integer
```

In, e.g., `orbit`, do not use `self` as a latex variable. Instead say something like, "let `X` be a dynamical system."

`Returns` -> `Return` and similar for one-line descriptions.

You are using a number of different formats for the `OUTPUT:`. I think you should at least be consistent, if not match the Sage coding conventions.

Remove `is_DynamicalSystem` because the `isinstance` already does what you want.

This is done in a number of other files.

```
from sage.categories.fields import Fields
_Fields = Fields()
```
Although I guess since module is lazily imported, it is not such a big deal. However, I would be happy to see not making this perma-instance issue worse, but not a strict requirement for a positive review.

```diff
-    Return a dynamical system on a projective scheme
+    Return a dynamical system on a projective scheme.
```

```diff

-    We can define dynamical systems on `P^1` by giving a polynomial or
     rational function::
```

Missing a doctest:

```python
class DynamicalSystem_generic(SchemeMorphism_polynomial):
    def __init__(self, polys_or_rat_fncts, domain):
```

```diff
-        REFERENCES: [Hutz2015]_, [MoPa1994]_
+        REFERENCES:

         if self.domain().ngens() > 2:
             raise TypeError("does not make sense in dimension >1")
```

Error messages should start with a lower case and not end with a period/full stop.

In a number of those functions that you now are deprecating, they are not calling the new functions, correct? I think they should simply call those functions they say they are being deprecated in favor of. Some of them do this, but not all of them I believe.

There might be more comments later, but this is what I have for now on my first pass.

I fixed most of those and have some discussion for the others.

- Note sure what you mean with the _Fields() import. I was told a couple years ago that it really should be done this way. Has that changed? What are the arguments for and against?

- the INPUT and OUTPUT consistently end in a '.' throughout the dynamical systems and schemes files, so I've left that consistent. However, the developer's guide does seem to give examples without ending in a period.

- For the INPUT you are suggesting the default be moved to the beginning on the description. Right now dynamical systems and schemes are consistently the other way. The conventions seem only to mention that the default value should be specified, not where.

- I'm not sure what you mean for the OUTPUT consistency. Yes, the OUTPUT description is formatted differently based on what makes the most sense for the OUTPUT of the functions, but they all match the conventions in the developer's guide.

- I disagree with removing is_DynamicalSystem. isinstance only works after you import the DynamicalSystem_generic class. With the distinction between endomorphisms and dynamical systems, it is important for the user to have an easy check for what they are working with.

- I couldn't find any instances of whether the error had capital or ending punctuation. Where did you see that?

So, the big open issue I see is whether to go through dynamical systems and schemes and change all the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting. What do you think?

You create a `_Fields` object in the global namespace, not an import, so it essentially becomes permanent in memory (although it is not a true memory leak). That is the argument against it. The argument for is that you might be creating the `Fields()` category frequently, which can slow things down. However, this only occurs when creating objects, so I would rather just replace `_Fields` with `Fields()`. Actually, IIRC, you can just do containment checking by `X in Fields` (without creating/getting an instance object).

The comment about the lazy import is that this is not done on startup, but only when you create one of these dynamical system objects.

> - the INPUT and OUTPUT consistently end in a '.' throughout the dynamical systems and schemes files, so I've left that consistent. However, the developer's guide does seem to give examples without ending in a period.


The convention is without periods and this is what most of Sage does.

I believe what most of Sage does is put it first, and this is what I do with all of my code that I write and request when I review. However I don't strongly care.

> - I'm not sure what you mean for the OUTPUT consistency. Yes, the OUTPUT description is formatted differently based on what makes the most sense for the OUTPUT of the functions, but they all match the conventions in the developer's guide.


Here are some of the styles used:

Hmmm...I might have mixed up tickets or misremembered the Symbolic Ring errors.

I wasn't sure how much you were actually adding versus copying over. Thank you for clarifying that. I am okay with letting it pass because it is how it was, but it would be nice to start converting it to the new version. I can do this with a reviewer change too.

I'll remove the global _Fields().

I'm still not 100% convinced that is_DynamicalSystem is not needed.

f = End(P)

g = DynamicalSystem(...) # on P

Then f.parent() == g.parent() is true. So without is_DynSys the only way to tell the difference is to check the class or see what member functions are available.

For the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting: Updating the files in sage/dynamical systems/arithmetic dynamics/ is certainly a reasonable request as they are created here and I can do that (probably later today). I think I'd prefer updating the sage/schemes/ files on a different ticket.

If this slows things down, feel free to leave it in. Like I said, it's not a big issue because this module lazily imported.

I think most people will first try:
