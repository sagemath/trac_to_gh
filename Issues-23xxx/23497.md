the majority of the code for working with arithmetical dynamical systems is in the respective morphism files in the sage/schemes folder. This is not very intuitive and as the code grows this is becoming increasing less ideal.

This ticket proposes creating a sage/dynamics/arithmetic_dynamics folder to house the dynamical systems code. This includes creating a class to distinguish between SchemeMorphism_polynomials which happen to be endomorphisms and those which should be treated dynamical systems. I consider this extra class as the negative effect of moving the code.


There are really two main reasons for this move.

- the dynamical systems functionality is extensive enough that it should be separated from the schemes functionality.  There is already a sage/dynamics folders so it makes sense to put it there.

- creating a dynamical system under the new structure is much easier and intuitive for the user

<a id='comment:1'></a>I've acheived an initial move of the code that achieves 'all tests pass', so I figured that was a good place to commit and get another set of eyes on this.

There remains much clean-up to be done. A few things I haven't done yet

- do we need to specify domain=P to get point iteration to work? What works and what doesn't with the domains

- is .as_scheme_morphism and .as_dynamical_system a performance hit (and excess object creation in memory)? If so, what's a better way to deal with this (basically the parent of a dynamical system is the endomorphism ring of schemes which creates a schememorphism...)

-  dynamicalsystems_generic defaults to affine which probably should be projective

- some more intelligence in the creation functions

When we are happy with this new functionality, then we'll need to merge in the following tickets which will conflict: #23234, #23333, #23334. So don't mark it positive-reivew even if it is ready.

<a id='comment:18'></a>Comments. I'm sorry if some of this is coming from old code already in Sage, but this might be a good time to clean it if it does.

Can you explain a little more about what is in the description about the extra class and why it is necessary? I don't really know this code/math so much to fully understand.

Indentation here:

```
.. [FH2015]     \J. A. de Faria, B. Hutz. Combinatorics of Cycle Lengths on
            Wehler K3 Surfaces over finite fields. New Zealand Journal

```

Do you want to worry about backwards compatibility with imports?

```diff

+                                  DynamicalSystem_generic):

and similar; in particular, you do not need the `\`.

```diff

+        - ``n`` -- a tuple of nonnegative integers; if ``n`` is an integer,

```
and similar changes.

```diff

```

```diff
-       INPUT: ``n`` - a positive integer.
+       INPUT:
+
+       - ``n`` -- a positive integer
```

In, e.g., `orbit`, do not use `self` as a latex variable. Instead say something like, "let `X` be a dynamical system."

`Returns` -> `Return` and similar for one-line descriptions.

You are using a number of different formats for the `OUTPUT:`. I think you should at least be consistent, if not match the Sage coding conventions.

Remove `is_DynamicalSystem` because the `isinstance` already does what you want.

This is done in a number of other files.

```
from sage.categories.fields import Fields
_Fields = Fields()
```
Although I guess since module is lazily imported, it is not such a big deal. However, I would be happy to see not making this perma-instance issue worse, but not a strict requirement for a positive review.

```diff

Missing a doctest:

```python

```

```diff

         if self.domain().ngens() > 2:
             raise TypeError("does not make sense in dimension >1")
```

Error messages should start with a lower case and not end with a period/full stop.

```

In a number of those functions that you now are deprecating, they are not calling the new functions, correct? I think they should simply call those functions they say they are being deprecated in favor of. Some of them do this, but not all of them I believe.

There might be more comments later, but this is what I have for now on my first pass.

<a id='comment:24'></a>I'll remove the global _Fields().

I'm still not 100% convinced that is_DynamicalSystem is not needed. Here is my thought process in some more detail: One of the big issues we struggled with on this ticket is how to differentiate between an endomorphism of a space and a dynamical system on a space without creating a category of schemes whose arrows are dynamical systems instead of scheme morphisms.

f = End(P)

g = DynamicalSystem(...) # on P

Then f.parent() == g.parent() is true. So without is_DynSys the only way to tell the difference is to check the class or see what member functions are available. There are simple conversion functions; e.g. f.as_dynamical_system(). Looking at the global is_* namespace, there are 21 functions currently.

For the INPUT/OUTPUT formatting: Updating the files in sage/dynamical systems/arithmetic dynamics/ is certainly a reasonable request as they are created here and I can do that (probably later today). I think I'd prefer updating the sage/schemes/ files on a different ticket.

If this slows things down, feel free to leave it in. Like I said, it's not a big issue because this module lazily imported.
