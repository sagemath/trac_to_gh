<a id='comment:14'></a>There probably is something I don't understand, but I don't see why when the node is a leaf, the algorithm for `self._count_and_skip()` returns `implicit` just like if it stopped on an edge. For example, 

```
sage: T = ImplicitSuffixTree(Word("cacao"))
sage: T._count_and_skip(3,(2,5))
('implicit', (3, 1), 3)

It's coherent with the condition in the code `if (trans[0][1] != None [...]):`, but I don't see how it is coherent with the documentation.
