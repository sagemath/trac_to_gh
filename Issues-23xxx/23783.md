If you want to run a single package's test suite, you can use the command, `./sage -f -c PKG`, but if you want to test each package as it is being installed, you need to set the environment variable `SAGE_CHECK` to "yes". We should add either a `Makefile` target or possibly a `./configure` option for this. Since I am guessing that many users are not in the habit of running `./configure`, maybe the `Makefile` target makes more sense.

`make check` would be one option, but that currently just does `make test`.
