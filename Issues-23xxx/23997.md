Sage uses a convention to append `.pNUM` to indicate patched or updated packages. However, because of the logic in `installed_packages(False)`, the version number returned by `installed_packages(False)` is the version given by `pip` instead of the Sage version number.

This causes in particular that optional doctests are not run for such packages. At the moment, the only package with this problem and which has optional doctests is `dot2tex`.
