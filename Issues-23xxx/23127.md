Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

Given the large number of files which need to be changed, this is done in parts.

The only other change in logic (other than adding extra checks that it did allocate) is this one:

That was actually meant to be safer. If you have an array of pointers, it's good practice to initialize it with zeros such that you can safely `free()` them.

There are no bugs in cysignals :-)

I find it a bit strange that the errors are non-deterministic. Usually, calls to `malloc()` are pretty predictable (the addresses that it returns are not, but I don't see how that would matter).

Of course, there are other upstreams too. :)

So the randomness almost certainly comes from the test:

```sage
sage: set_random_seed()
sage: K = random_cone(max_ambient_dim=8,
....:                 min_rays=1,
....:                 strictly_convex=True,
....:                 solid=True)
sage: b = K.lyapunov_rank()
sage: n = K.lattice_dim()
sage: 1 <= b <= n
True
sage: b == n-1
False
```
In certain cases, it must fail in some way. The only change that is made in chasing down the codepath in `linbox_copy`:

```diff
@@ -234,7 +235,7 @@ cdef inline celement *linbox_copy(celement modulus, celement *entries,  Py_ssize
     """
     Create a copy of the entries array.

     memcpy(entries_copy, entries, sizeof(celement)*nrows*ncols)
     return entries_copy
 
```
It might have to do with the fact that an error gets raised during some tests by `check_allocarray`, which then results in the error message because the `except NULL` that gets percolated up to Python.
