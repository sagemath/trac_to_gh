I thought of that. At the moment I kept things consistent with other doctests giving the same results. So if using tolerance I think 
* we need to go back to the whole series of doctests not just the ones broken by this upgrade
* You can you only set one tolerance for one result so you need to align things not with `0.9999999` but with `0.999999` (one less `9`)

That being said there is already inconsistency in the number of decimals quoted for the results starting with `1.` compared to the one starting with `0.9`. Harmonizing all of this would probably be a good thing.

Would you support touching the other doctest giving similar results to the ones broken by the upgrade?

Done! Note that I didn't convert this to use tolerance

```
    We get additional convergence information with the `verbose` option::

        sage: minimize(f, [.1, .3, .4], algorithm="ncg", verbose=True)
        Optimization terminated successfully.
        ...
        (0.9999999..., 0.999999..., 0.999999...)
```
because the verbose output message is already caught by `...` and you cannot mix that with `tol`. It just fails, you cannot use `...` and `tol` at the same time.

Ok, back into review. I removed the offending documentation file and removed references to `weave` in the other files in the numerical_sage section. Please do a proof read to make sure it makes sense.

This update does not quite work on FreeBSD, as illustrated by the following ugly
crash in plain Sage python (as well as in Sage code that uses `Voronoi`, such as 
`RiemannSurface` one).

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> points = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2],[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]])
>>> from scipy.spatial import Voronoi
>>> Voronoi(points)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[] 
sage: C=Curve(x^3+3*y^3+5) 
sage: C.riemann_surface() 
...
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```
