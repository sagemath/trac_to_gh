I thought of that. At the moment I kept things consistent with other doctests giving the same results. So if using tolerance I think 
* we need to go back to the whole series of doctests not just the ones broken by this upgrade
* You can you only set one tolerance for one result so you need to align things not with `0.9999999` but with `0.999999` (one less `9`)

That being said there is already inconsistency in the number of decimals quoted for the results starting with `1.` compared to the one starting with `0.9`. Harmonizing all of this would probably be a good thing.

Would you support touching the other doctest giving similar results to the ones broken by the upgrade?

Done! Note that I didn't convert this to use tolerance

```
    We get additional convergence information with the `verbose` option::

        sage: minimize(f, [.1, .3, .4], algorithm="ncg", verbose=True)
        Optimization terminated successfully.
        ...
        (0.9999999..., 0.999999..., 0.999999...)
```
because the verbose output message is already caught by `...` and you cannot mix that with `tol`. It just fails, you cannot use `...` and `tol` at the same time.

<div id="comment:25" align="right">Comment 25</div>

This update does not quite work on FreeBSD, as illustrated by the following ugly
crash in plain Sage python (as well as in Sage code that uses `Voronoi`, such as 
`RiemannSurface` one).

```
>>> import numpy as np
>>> points = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2],[2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]])
>>> from scipy.spatial import Voronoi
>>> Voronoi(points)
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

```
sage: R.<x,y>=QQ[] 
sage: C=Curve(x^3+3*y^3+5) 
sage: C.riemann_surface() 
...
Unhandled SIGSEGV: A segmentation fault occurred.
```
