I'm not sure about the changes in `real_double.pyx` as those extra imports do take some time, and they are in code that I could see being used in tight loops. While I am not sure if those will make a difference in real code, at least my simple testing says:

```
sage: x = RDF(3)
sage: %timeit x.is_integer()
The slowest run took 102.35 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.05 µs per loop
```
vs old

```
sage: x = RDF(3)
sage: %timeit x.is_integer()
The slowest run took 223.61 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 818 ns per loop
sage: %timeit from sage.rings.integer_ring import ZZ
The slowest run took 8.38 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 825 ns per loop
```
Again, I am not saying those changes need to be reverted, but maybe there is a better place to break circular imports.
