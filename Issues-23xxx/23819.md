Florian Aigner just pointed out to me that `a_i,j=c_{i,j}+c_{i-1,j-1}-c_{i-1,j}-c_{i,j-1}`.  I would expect that

```
        n = len(list(corner))-1
        asm = [[corner[i+1][j+1]+corner[i][j]-corner[i][j+1]-corner[i+1][j]
                for j in range(n)]
               for i in range(n)]
        return AlternatingSignMatrix(asm)
```
is the fastest version possible.  Curiously, this is not the case, it is even slower than the original version.  Why?

sage: timeit("[A.from_corner_sum(corner) for corner in lC]", number=1, repeat=1)

I do not like general exception catching: it can hide real errors. Also, you should catch `Exception` as I think `StandardError` would also catch more serious errors and interrupts (e.g., ctrl-C) that should rise up.

You also do not need the `else` in that `try-except` block.

Me neither, but in the case at hand it is necessary.  However, I agree that `StandardError` should be replaced with `(TypeError, ValueError)` in line 1196.  I don't know what would be better to catch in line 1199 though.

> Also, you should catch `Exception` as I think `StandardError` would also catch more serious errors and interrupts (e.g., ctrl-C) that should rise up.


Actually, it is the other way round.

I know, but I think it makes the code much clearer - it is easy to overlook the return just before.

I disagree. It suggests extra logic as opposed to the fact that it should just fall through and the indented `except` block is the "error handling" portion. Although I would not hold up this ticket because of this.

In a way, I am not usually satisfied using errors to control program flow, but I think this is a necessary evil to differentiate the input in a fast way.

Jessica, Kevin, do you have any comments?

The hierarchy of classes is here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy

`Exception` catches a strict superset of `StandardError`.  For example, you can try:

```
def testit1():
    try:
        l = iter([1,2,3])
        while True:
            print l.next()
    except Exception as e:
        print e
def testit2():
    try:
        l = iter([1,2,3])
        while True:
            print l.next()
    except StandardError as e:
        print e
```

well, the `m = self._matrix_space(asm)` is also indented.  But anyway, I removed the `else`.

> In a way, I am not usually satisfied using errors to control program flow, but I think this is a necessary evil to differentiate the input in a fast way.


Yes, unless there is an easy way to check, python prefers to try.

That depends on how you define "easy". If you mean in terms of readability and robustness, then the containment check is better IMO. However, the speed-up is clear.

Also, I don't think we also have to worry about 1x1 matrices versus size 1 arrays. However, it is an internal behavior change because it now considers it as a matrix instead of an array.

Instead of

```
corner = MatrixSpace(ZZ, n+1)(corner)
asm = [[corner[i+1,j+1]+corner[i,j]-corner[i,j+1]-corner[i+1,j]
           for j in range(n)]
            for i in range(n)]
self._matrix_space(asm)
```
You should use matrix operations

```
corner = MatrixSpace(ZZ, n+1)(corner)
asm = corner[1:,1:] + corner[:n,:n] - corner[:n,1:] - corner[1:,:n]
```
As I mentioned in #23819, a Python loop is a bad idea if you want speed. Though matrix slices are not seriously optimized in Sage (we are not using memory views), but still there is a win

```
sage: n = 5
sage: corner = random_matrix(ZZ, n+1)
sage: %timeit asm = matrix([[corner[i+1,j+1]+corner[i,j]-corner[i,j+1]-corner[i+1,j] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)])
10000 loops, best of 3: 108 µs per loop
sage: %timeit asm = corner[1:,1:] + corner[:n,:n] - corner[:n,1:] - corner[1:,:n]
10000 loops, best of 3: 34.5 µs per loop
```
(In numpy it would have been tremendous!)
