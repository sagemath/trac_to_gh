1) `Posets.DiamondPoset(5).is_join_distributive(certificate=True)` gives "global name 'DiGraph' is not defined".

2) Same applies to `is_meet_distributive`.

3) In the doc of `is_join_pseudocomplemented` a "greatest" should be "least".

4) `is_vertically_decomposable` has some mutually exclusive properties.

5) Some seealso-blocks completed.

Keywords: days88, IMA coding sprints
