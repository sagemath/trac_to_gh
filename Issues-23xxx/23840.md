When the optional package database_cremona_ellcurve is installed, doctest failures happen (see below). The underlying reason is that the Cremona database contains a different generator for elliptic curve `37a1` than the one computed with the `.gens()` method (the generators are each other's negative):

```
sage: EllipticCurve("37a1")._compute_gens(proof=True, use_database=True)
([(0 : 0 : 1)], True)
sage: EllipticCurve("37a1")._compute_gens(proof=True, use_database=False)
([(0 : -1 : 1)], True)
```

Doctest failures:

There is no way to have an output dependent on an optional package... the following does not exist

```
    sage: my_test()
    +1    # in sage
    -1    # optional - cremona
```

The mini database does not have the same columns as the big one!?

And this is indeed a problem... however we might have #22510 in at some point! The only easy way I see is to have two installs of Sage.

Yes, that's the case. I have no idea why it is like this:

```

I vote for changing this. The mini database should be just a truncated version of the large database.

It is the other way around. Tests pass without the database, they fail with the database.

I found out how to manually install the optional spkg in a way which allows for easy manual uninstallation:
1. copy the file cremona.db into local/share/cremona
2. copy the file local/var/lib/sage/installed/database_cremona_ellcurve-20161017
in both cases copying from another build with this spkg installed.

The tests still pass -- good!  So I think this is now fixed.
