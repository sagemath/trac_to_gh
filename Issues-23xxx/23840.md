When the optional package database_cremona_ellcurve is installed, doctest failures happen (see below). The underlying reason is that the Cremona database contains a different generator for elliptic curve `37a1` than the one computed with the `.gens()` method (the generators are each other's negative):

```
sage: EllipticCurve("37a1")._compute_gens(proof=True, use_database=True)
([(0 : 0 : 1)], True)
sage: EllipticCurve("37a1")._compute_gens(proof=True, use_database=False)
([(0 : -1 : 1)], True)
```

Doctest failures:

There is no way to have an output dependent on an optional package... the following does not exist

```
    sage: my_test()
    +1    # in sage
    -1    # optional - cremona
```

I don't believe that `E.gens()` is uniformly minus the generators of what we have with the cremona database installed.

As the ticket is about elliptic curves over number fields I did not think it would be affected by the optional database, but in fact it is since some of these examples take an elliptic curve over Q and base-change them up.  What we did for such examples over Q is not to use the gens() method at all but just hard-code the points in the examples.  I volunteer to do that -- but all the computers I use have the optional database installed (well, what would you expect?!) so it is harder for me to test.  I will not do this today though.",

OK, this is clearer now.  As the ticket is about elliptic curves over number fields I did not think it would be affected by the optional database, but in fact it is since some of these examples take an elliptic curve over Q and base-change them up.  What we did for such examples over Q is not to use the gens() method at all but just hard-code the points in the examples.  I volunteer to do that -- but all the computers I use have the optional database installed (well, what would you expect?!) so it is harder for me to test.  I will not do this today though.

Definitely changing the mini database, and the associated code, should not be in the *blocker* ticket!

Here is what to do: there exist functions already to take some data tarball to create the db file for the optional database.

I have a version of ell_number_field.py which should do the job as it no longer calls gens() on any elliptic curve over Q of conductor <400000.  It passes all tests on 8.1.beta5 without the optiona db installed.  I want to test on 8.0.beta5+database_cremona_ellcurve but am having trouble.  I just built it in an upgrade from some earlier version and Sage runs but sage -t gives

I found out how to manually install the optional spkg in a way which allows for easy manual uninstallation:
1. copy the file cremona.db into local/share/cremona
2. copy the file local/var/lib/sage/installed/database_cremona_ellcurve-20161017
in both cases copying from another build with this spkg installed.

The tests still pass -- good!  So I think this is now fixed.
