There are 2 subgroups of the rational torsion subgroup of a modular abelian variety that Sage can compute. The rational cuspidal subgroup is the intersection of the rational subgroup subgroup and the cuspidal subgroup. The rational cusp subgroup is the group generated by differences of rational cusps. 

The rational cusps subgroup is a subgroup of the rational cuspidal subgroup. The divisor_of_order method for rational torsion subgroups should use the order of the rational cuspidal subgroup instead of the order of the rational cusp subgroup.

This is a change that is actually useful. Consider the case of J0(45)

```
sage: J = J0(45)
sage: J.rational_cusp_subgroup().order()
32
sage: J.rational_cuspidal_subgroup().order()
64
sage: J.rational_torsion_subgroup().divisor_of_order()
32
```
This is the first J0(N) where they differ.

Keywords: **modular abelian variety, cuspidal subgroup, sd87**

ok, assuming that you know what you do.

By the way, the related old ticket #6925 needs care.
