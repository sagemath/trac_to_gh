I suggested something like this on #21672 but didn't have immediate need to follow up on it.

Something like this will be useful for making Windows builds more reliable, however, as there are some operations that can fail if they are run simultaneously during parallel builds.

In particular I'm trying to trace down failures with DLL rebasing, and at least part of the problem is that rebase can fail if it's being multiple times simultaneously as can happen during a parallel build (especially toward the end of the build when lots of Python packages are being installed--these are fast and often results in multiple rebases being run simultaneously).

With tickets like #22509 it will also be possible to make further restrictions, such as not running rebase while a package is being uninstalled.

I think it would be good to mention somewhere in a comment that this may be used in build scripts, but only for packages depending on Python.

The help mentions

```
The command may also be a Python module in which case it is run in the same
Python interpreter as this script (a small optimization to avoid restarting the
Python interpreter).
```
but I don't see that in the implementation.

See also https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2015-November/698421.html

It seems that Python 2 has unbuffered `sys.stderr` by default, which means that the flushing is not needed.

But this was changed in Python 3, so the flushing would be required there.

If I recall correctly, we require system Python 2.6 or later, which means that you can't use `argparse`.

The `flush` keyword is Python 3 only.

That's not an issue.  We already addressed this some time ago... https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/tree/build/sage_bootstrap/compat?id=3faf8d0519918feb308b3bb56fbe36e0a0c2a290

The question is, should the script live in `build/bin` or `src/bin`, and what should go in the shebang line?  This is unclear for Python scripts that we want to work at build time and run time...

But that's the problem, because if it's intended to be used at runtime it should in that case be using Sage's Python (I guess?), and with `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` this is incorrect since `python` still means `python2.7`.

That said, the original use case for this was with `pip`, and running `pip` is still arguably a "build" action, so maybe this should just be moved to `build/bin` to emphasize that it's a build tool.  It can use the system python by default and/or Sage's Python 2 because ultimately it doesn't matter what Python this is run with since it just execs the program it wraps.
