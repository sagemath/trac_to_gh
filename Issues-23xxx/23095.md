After making a minor change to `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/generator.py`, the change did not take effect. I.e. the generated file `src/sage/ext/interpreters/wrapper_rdf.pyx` did *not* change.

In particular, the following should cause an error while building the interpreters, but it did not:

```diff
diff --git a/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/generator.py b/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/generator.py
index 3af99b2..5a3bfbb 100644

+++ b/src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/generator.py
@@ -316,6 +316,8 @@ class InterpreterGenerator(object):
             sage: print(buff.getvalue())
             # Automatically generated by ...
         """
+        assert False
+
         s = self._spec
         w = write
         types = set()
```

The reason is that this only checks one source file (`src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/__init__.py`):

```python
    # Although multiple files are generated by this function, since
    # they are all generated at once it suffices to make sure if just
    # one of the generated files is older than the generator sources
    src_file = __file__
    gen_file = os.path.join(dirname, '__init__.py')

    if os.path.exists(gen_file):
        if getmtime(gen_file) > getmtime(src_file) and not force:
            return
```

I think at some earlier version of this (before it was merged) it did check all source files?  I don't know when it changed.
