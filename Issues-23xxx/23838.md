```
- In method `solve` of class `IntegratedCurve`, the step of integration needs to be evaluated numerically (using `numerical_approx`) before calling any algorithm, in order to allow it to be an expression such as `pi`.
- In method `solve`, when using Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm ('bsimp'), method `ode_solve` was called in a wrong way.
- 'Bulirsch' was misspelled in documentation.
- Minor corrections were made regarding `rk4_maxima` being the default algorithm of method `solve`.

I feel like the fact that the corresponding `solve` function does not numerically evaluate such expressions is a bug that deserves its own ticket and (independent) fix. Subsequently, I would remove those changes that work around it.

I cannot comment on the second point, so someone else will have to review that.

Thank you for your comments.
Corrections did have to be made about `rk4_maxima` being the default algorithm of method `solve`, and the numerical evaluation of the step is then maintained until another ticket allows to remove it.
