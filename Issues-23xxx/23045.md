In such cases, i guess we should at least know (and collect somewhere), which errors are "recurrent" or "unfixable". We should run the self-tests more frequently, as finding broken self-tests also leads to  bugfixes that benefit to all of us, see e.g. #23056, #23057 which will be fixed soon. Apart from `python` which is known not to pass self-tests, i hope that all other will pass on 32bit system (which is still a supported arch).

I agree that since i am doing a systematic check of all standard packages for the first time on 32bits (and will go to all optional when this will be done), there are many blockeres appearing in a short delay, and it might be unreasonable to wait for all of them. However, once they will be all fixed, we could become more strict when a new issue appears, and for this to happen smoothly, we should be sure that those tests are run on a more regular basis to avoid such an accumulation, e.g. by letting the patchbots to run them.

They seem to be reactive to such issues, see the recent thread https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2017-05/msg00010.html So, perhaps could we contribute to bug reports directly upstream each time we find such a problem, so that every distro benefit from the changes (with some delay), not only the ones that can afford writing their own patches ?

I need to test the problem on the latest version first, in case it is fixed already.
