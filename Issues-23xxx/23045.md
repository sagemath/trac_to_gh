In such cases, i guess we should at least know (and collect somewhere), which errors are "recurrent" or "unfixable". We should run the self-tests more frequently, as finding broken self-tests also leads to  bugfixes that benefit to all of us, see e.g. #23056, #23057 which will be fixed soon. Apart from `python` which is known not to pass self-tests, i hope that all other will pass on 32bit system (which is still a supported arch).

They seem to be reactive to such issues, see the recent thread https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2017-05/msg00010.html So, perhaps could we contribute to bug reports directly upstream each time we find such a problem, so that every distro benefit from the changes (with some delay), not only the ones that can afford writing their own patches ?

I need to test the problem on the latest version first, in case it is fixed already.
