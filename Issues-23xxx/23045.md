They seem to be reactive to such issues, see the recent thread https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gsl/2017-05/msg00010.html So, perhaps could we contribute to bug reports directly upstream each time we find such a problem, so that every distro benefit from the changes (with some delay), not only the ones that can afford writing their own patches ?

I need to test the problem on the latest version first, in case it is fixed already.
