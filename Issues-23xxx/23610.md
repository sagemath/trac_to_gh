It would be nice to be able to use the doctesting framework of sage in packages that depend on sage.
This is already possible right now, but requires importing all the functions in the package every time which is quite burdensome.  
Adding a `--import=package` option to `sage -t`  that does the equivalent of 

```
from package import *
```
in the doctesting namespace would make life a lot easier.

Great!  This is definitely a feature that people have requested over the years.

The code mostly looks good.  Why do you need to add quotes around numbers in a few of the tests?

Positive review once tests pass.

On the other hand, having *complete working examples* in the documentation is really useful. Compared to some other packages, this is one big plus for Sage: I can literally copy/paste the examples and be guaranteed that they work.

I have been thinking about a little bit more recently, and my main argument was that doing: 

```
from blah import *
```
felt a bit rediculus and since sage was not doing it, I would not want to do it as well in my package. But I now better understand the differences between sage and a pip installable python package. Sage wants to be significantly more then just being a python library, it also wants to present its own user interface (either via jupyter notebook or via the commandline interface) and this is why things are different for sage and a python package. So I agree that this can be closed.

There are two bigger long term things related to this discussion which I think would be good:

1) seperate our doctesting module and make it into a python package. It seems to me that the problems that all our doctesting code is trying to solve is not really sage specific and other people might want to use it as well. Therefor it might be better of as a standalone package.

2) make sage also import less into the global namespace (and have more from .. import .. in the doctests) would also help wit the startup time of sage and remove the need of a lot of lazy importing. I feel less strong about this point then about point 1).
