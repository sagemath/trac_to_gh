sage: Q1=QuadraticForm(ZZ,1,[1])
sage: Q1.polynomial()
2*x^2
sage: Q1([1])
1
sage: Q1
Quadratic form in 1 variables over Integer Ring with coefficients: 
[ 1 ]
sage: Q1.Hessian_matrix()
[2]
sage: Q1.Gram_matrix()
[1]
```
The polynomial should rather be `x^2` as it satisfies
`Q([t]) = Q.poly().subs(x=t)` where `t` is any integer.
To make it even clearer:

```
sage: q = QuadraticForm(GF(2),2,[1,1,1])
sage: q
Quadratic form in 2 variables over Finite Field of size 2 with coefficients: 
[ 1 1 ]
[ * 1 ]
sage: q.polynomial()
0
```
