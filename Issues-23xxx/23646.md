Sadly, this change was necessary to make the doctest pass. Otherwise, we are comparing a filtered vector-space (V) and a bare vector-space V.get_degree(0). And they are no longer considered to be equal.

In fact, the doctest

```
V.get_degree(0) == V
```
still passes (is True) but the opposite comparison

```
V == V.get_degree(0)
```
is False. I do not know if this was the existing behaviour, but probably. This is because the `__eq__` for free module accepts everything that acts as a free module, whereas the `__eq__` for filtered modules only accepts filtered modules.

I think (but this should be checked) that we are not changing the current behaviour.
