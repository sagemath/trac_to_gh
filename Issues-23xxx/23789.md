This is bad:

```
$ env |grep 99
CONFIGURED_CC=gcc -std=gnu99
CC=gcc -std=gnu99
```
I did not ask for `-std=gnu99` and `configure` should not unilaterally decide that I want that.

In particular, there is a long-standing Python bug causing distutils to use `$CC` to compile C++ code leading to plenty of warnings

```
cc1plus: warning: command line option ‘-std=gnu99’ is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++
```
If I recall correctly, the analogous behaviour for clang is a hard error instead of a warning. So this might break a clang build.

...which we do in order to check that C99 is supported:

```
if test -z "$CC"; then
    SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([a C compiler is missing])
else
    # Check that we can compile C99 code
    AC_PROG_CC_C99()
    if test "x$ac_cv_prog_cc_c99" = xno
    then
        SAGE_MUST_INSTALL_GCC([your C compiler cannot compile C99 code])
    fi
fi
```
