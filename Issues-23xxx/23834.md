The documentation `ja/a_tour_of_sage` uses `html_use_smartypants`, but this is now deprecated:

```
RemovedInSphinx17Warning: html_use_smartypants option is deprecated. Smart quotes are on by default; if you want to disable or customize them, use the smart_quotes option in docutils.conf.
```
If I delete the line `html_use_smartypants = False`, there is no difference in the resulting html or latex files.

We could instead create a file `doc/ja/a_tour_of_sage/docutils.conf` containing

```
[parsers]
smart_quotes = no
```
to keep the old behavior, but as far as I can tell, this option is not used anywhere.
