Quotients of orders in number fields, specifically the maximal order could support some functionality present but not implemented for general quotient rings. This includes methods such as cardinality(), krull_dimension() and iteration.

These methods are implemented using a new subclass of the general QuotientRing class currently used. Furthermore the quotient() method of the class Order is changed to create these special quotient rings. It also returns the special case that is implemented, residue fields, when taking a quotient by a maximal ideal.

**Keywords:** order quotient

**Commit:** [4747e94584c828eaa39aa1d02e717c80db393c3f](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/4747e94584c828eaa39aa1d02e717c80db393c3f)

**Work Issues:** doctest failures, new quotient behaviour is different from old for these rings, for example gens has less elements now

I think this is a really useful addition for user friendliness, this approach feels a lot more natural to me.

A couple of not too serious concerns I have that I'd love to hear other peoples opinions about:

1. Some more things could be implemented, like `additive_order` for elements would be useful.

2. There is quite a stark difference between the prime and non-prime case (related to 1.) how accepted is it to have the type of the output depend so much on a non-trivial property of the input?
