<a id='comment:7'></a>The code looks good. Here are two organization remarks.

If you really want `LZ_decomposition` as an alias you would better do

```
class A:
    def f(self):
       ...

    g = f
```
That way the documentation appears identical on both methods.

In the documentation you should respect spaces around equality sign: `A = B` and not `A=B`.
