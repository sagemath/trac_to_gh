This was my first contribution to Sage, so, I tried to do something simple: I added a standard group presentation to the Heisenberg group over integers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_group).

Once it has been accepted and I am sure how everything here works, I will try more complex collaborations.

Welcome to Sage (development).

Overall it looks good. However, I would like to see a little bit more functionality before putting this in Sage:

- Allow arbitrary `n` (so it will be `2n + 1` dimensional).
- Call the generators `pi` and `qi`, where `i = 1, ..., n`.
- Have a second parameter that takes a prime p or 0 that denotes the base field of **Z**/p**Z**.
- Have the group as a matrix group.

If you do not want to do this, then I can.

Also, if you could split the long docstring lines to at most 80 characters and add a reference to the wikipedia page:

```
REFERENCES:

- :wikipeida:`Heisenberg_group`
```
