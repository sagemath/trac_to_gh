This happens only when testing the Sage package. Any other way of running the testsuite works fine.

I have absolutely no idea why and I hope that somebody else can fix it.

Yes. The issue is that Python's `open()` and `print()` functions depend on the locale:

```
$ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 python3 -c 'print(open("/dev/null"))'
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='/dev/null' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
$ LC_ALL=C python3 -c 'print(open("/dev/null"))'
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='/dev/null' mode='r' encoding='ANSI_X3.4-1968'>
```

It turns out that cypari2 was assuming that files were opened in UTF-8 mode. I now made this explicit with `open(...., encoding="utf-8")` in Python 3.
