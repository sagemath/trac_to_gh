LinBox has algorithms to work with sparse matrices. This ticket provides the necessary interface for:
- solving sparse systems over integers
- computing determinant and rank
- computing minimal and characteristic polynomials

Some cleaning had to be done as a first step (used to be #26178).

One possible obstruction for the change `Py_ssize_t` -> `size_t` is that matrices can be accessed with negative indices. Perhaps it is not so dramatic. However, if this change happend we want to do it coherently with vectors, etc.

For the other proposition, calling properly LinBox with casting where necessary do not look too ugly for me. We can arrange so that it only appears in the code at `sage/libs/linbox/`.
