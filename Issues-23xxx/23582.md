A doctest of the `midpoint` code in `geometry/hyperbolic_space/hyperbolic_geodesic.py` relies on exact reproduction of complicated symbolic expressions involving square roots. With recent changes in Pynac the representation of the result no longer matches, although it is mathematically identical.

The ticket changes the doctest to match results numerically.

The change is no longer necessary because the mentioned change in Pynac didn't happen. I agree to make the ticket invalid.

However, let me point out that it is highly unlikely that a symbolic error would pass such a numeric test. Note that such numeric tests additionally test the FP evaluation code so it's more likely to catch bugs.
