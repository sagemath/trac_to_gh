```
                if self.is_real() or (hasattr(c,"is_coxeter_element") and c.is_coxeter_element()):
                    smart_covers = in_unitary_group = True

                R = self.reflections()

but yours is fine, too!

Well, this works but doesn't check whether an element is a Coxeter element :-)

Here are some definitions:

1. A standard Coxeter element is the product of the generators in some order

    2a. A Coxeter element is an element that is conjugate to a standard Coxeter element.

    2b. This is equivalent to : A Coxeter element is an element for that has eigenvalue e^{2\pi i / h} where h is the Coxeter number.

Given the alternative description in 2, this condition can be relaxed to:

2c. A Coxeter element is an element that has a primitive h-th root of unity as an eigenvalue.

This can be shown to be equivalent to

2d. A Coxeter element is an element that is obtained from a standard Coxeter element by conjugation and Galois automorphisms.

For Weyl groups, 2a - 2d are all equivalent, while one can show that in general, there are k conjugacy classes of Coxeter elements where k is the degree of the field extension of the field of definition over QQ. You find all these notions in my paper arxiv.org/abs/1404.5522 with Vic Reiner and Vivien Ripoll.

We are talking here about finite Coxeter groups, so Travis method should be ok.

I do not care here about general complex reflection groups.

This might just be my lack of properly learning the terminology as I've learned the product of all generators is a Coxeter element and that all Coxeter elements are conjugate (stated more as a fact rather than a definition.

Actually, you might want edit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxeter_element):

> A *Coxeter element* is a product of all simple reflections. The product depends on the order in which they are taken, but different orderings produce conjugate elements, which have the same order.


I don't really care about the terminology, so standard Coxeter elements for the above and the conjugacy class being Coxeter elements is good with me. Although we should make sure we explain things in our documentation more than anything.

It may be worth pointing out that for a general Coxeter group, the "standard Coxeter elements" (ie, product of all simple reflections in some order) are only guaranteed to be conjugate if the Coxeter diagram is acyclic. This will of course be true for the finite case we're considering here, but notably, it doesn't extend to type A affine.
