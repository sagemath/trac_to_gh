Currently plethsym of symmetric functions `f(g)` where both f and g are symmetric functions is implemented.  This ticket would add the feature to allow `g` to be a tensor of symmetric functions.

If `X = tensor([s[1],s[[]]])` and `Y = tensor([s[[]], s[1]])` then `f(X+Y)` and `f(X*Y)` make sense and follow the notation found in mathematical papers that use plethystic notation.

Hi Mike!

I attached some code for working with symmetric functions in several alphabets, including the plethysm of an ordinary and a multivariate symmetric function as well as the plethysm of a multivariate and an ordinary symmetric function.  It is by no means polished, but maybe you can use it anyway.

This is also not as easily introduced as you suggest since the parent of tensors of symmetric functions is not currently implemented.

Not quite. There is a parent for `s # s`, but it is the generic CFM tensor product class. However, it would not be difficult to create such a parent (with perhaps a custom element class), and I think it would be straightforward to plug that into the current framework.

---

Some code comments:

This is a little cleaner:

```diff
-tHA = TensorProductsCategory.category_of(HopfAlgebrasWithBasis(R))
+tHA = HopfAlgebrasWithBasis(R).TensorProducts()
```

Why not this:

```diff
-            tparents = list(x.parent().__dict__['_sets'])
+            tparents = x.parent()._sets
```

For better readability (if it goes slightly over the 80 char/line, that's okay, it's worth it IMO):

```python
            return sum(d*prod(sum(raise_c(r)(c)
                                  * tensor([parent(p[r].plethysm(base(la)))
                                            for (base,la) in zip(tparents,trm)])
                                  for (trm,c) in x)
                              for r in mu)
                       for (mu, d) in p(self))
```

> What is the definition of that notation?


It appears at the bottom of page 6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0307383, `Lambda(r)` is defined on top of page 5.  Just as in Macdonald, the tensor positions correspond to the conjugacy classes of the cyclic group `1, zeta, zeta^2, ...`

This is less artificial than it may look, it makes symmetric functions into a plethory, https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407227v1.

On the other hand, it is more specialised than it looks, because it is the special case of the cyclic group of the more general definition on page 9 of https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604126.  Again, one needs to identify the conjugacy classes of a finite group with the tensor positions.

<a id='comment:19'></a>Dear Travis,

do you have an idea how/where we should provide methods `change_basis`, `restrict_degree`, `diagonal` and `scalar`?

* `change_basis` would take a tensor product of symmetric functions and a tuple of as many bases as there are tensor positions.  It's somehow like a "diagonally applied plethysm".  Maybe we want to write:

```
sage: tensor([s,h])(X*Y)
s[1] # h[1]
```

* for `restrict_degree`, I'd like to write

```
sage: ((X+Y)^2).restrict_degree([1,2])
p[] # p[1, 1] + 2*p[1] # p[1]
``` 

* similarly, for `diagonal` and `scalar`
