Currently plethsym of symmetric functions `f(g)` where both f and g are symmetric functions is implemented.  This ticket would add the feature to allow `g` to be a tensor of symmetric functions.

If `X = tensor([s[1],s[[]]])` and `Y = tensor([s[[]], s[1]])` then `f(X+Y)` and `f(X*Y)` make sense and follow the notation found in mathematical papers that use plethystic notation.

Hi Mike!

I attached some code for working with symmetric functions in several alphabets, including the plethysm of an ordinary and a multivariate symmetric function as well as the plethysm of a multivariate and an ordinary symmetric function.  It is by no means polished, but maybe you can use it anyway.

sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(QQ).s()
sage: X = tensor([s([1]), s([])])
sage: Y = tensor([s([]), s([1])]);
sage: X(s[2])

Hi Martin,
What is the definition of that notation?  I understand what f(expression) means, but I am not sure if I know a meaning of the definition of (f \otimes g)(expression).  Do you have a mathematical reference?

This is also not as easily introduced as you suggest since the parent of tensors of symmetric functions is not currently implemented.

Not quite. There is a parent for `s # s`, but it is the generic CFM tensor product class. However, it would not be difficult to create such a parent (with perhaps a custom element class), and I think it would be straightforward to plug that into the current framework.

Some code comments:

This is a little cleaner:

```diff
-tHA = TensorProductsCategory.category_of(HopfAlgebrasWithBasis(R))
+tHA = HopfAlgebrasWithBasis(R).TensorProducts()
```

Why not this:

```diff
-            tparents = list(x.parent().__dict__['_sets'])
+            tparents = x.parent()._sets
```

For better readability (if it goes slightly over the 80 char/line, that's okay, it's worth it IMO):

```python
            return sum(d*prod(sum(raise_c(r)(c)
                                  * tensor([parent(p[r].plethysm(base(la)))
                                            for (base,la) in zip(tparents,trm)])
                                  for (trm,c) in x)
                              for r in mu)
                       for (mu, d) in p(self))
```

In short, I think I should take back my suggestion.

Replying to [@zabrocki](#comment:10):

> What is the definition of that notation?

It appears at the bottom of page 6 of https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0307383, `Lambda(r)` is defined on top of page 5.  Just as in Macdonald, the tensor positions correspond to the conjugacy classes of the cyclic group `1, zeta, zeta^2, ...`

This is less artificial than it may look, it makes symmetric functions into a plethory, https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407227v1.

On the other hand, it is more specialised than it looks, because it is the special case of the cyclic group of the more general definition on page 9 of https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0604126.  Again, one needs to identify the conjugacy classes of a finite group with the tensor positions.

Dear Travis,

do you have an idea how/where we should provide methods `change_basis`, `restrict_degree`, `diagonal` and `scalar`?

* `change_basis` would take a tensor product of symmetric functions and a tuple of as many bases as there are tensor positions.  It's somehow like a "diagonally applied plethysm".  Maybe we want to write:

```
sage: tensor([s,h])(X*Y)
s[1] # h[1]
```

* for `restrict_degree`, I'd like to write

```
sage: ((X+Y)^2).restrict_degree([1,2])
p[] # p[1, 1] + 2*p[1] # p[1]
``` 

* similarly, for `diagonal` and `scalar`

Alas, I have absolutely no clue what I'd have to type into the editor to achieve this :-(

Help appreciated, but I'm afraid I cannot contribute much besides what is in the attached file.
