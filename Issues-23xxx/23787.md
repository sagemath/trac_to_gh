Oh, I know why. Just look at `I.__richcmp__`, which gives the multivariate comparison (using Gröbner bases) and never even sees this code path. So I am going to remove the `I > J` and `J < I` tests.

Okay, I fixed that and a bug along the way now that the code is actually being tested.

The remaining failure is the same as the other number field because it was using `cmp_universal`. So I just updated the output.

Needs review.
