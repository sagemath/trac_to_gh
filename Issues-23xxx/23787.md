I think we should try to match the existing behavior, or at least understand why the changes are necessary. The tests that have a different order are not so big IMO, but the `I < J` and `J > I` test failing should be explained.

The remaining failure is the same as the other number field because it was using `cmp_universal`. So I just updated the output.

Needs review.
