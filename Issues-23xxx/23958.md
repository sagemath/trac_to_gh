Inner products / bilinear forms  like

`ZZ x ZZ --> CC , RR, QQ`

etc. make sense.

More general, let `M` be a free module over `R` and let `B` be a ring containing `R` then inner products
`M x M --> B` make sense and can be allowed.

<a id='comment:14'></a>Somewhat. I was thinking of having a full class for bilinear forms along the lines of:

```python
class BilinearForm(object):
    def __init__(self, V, W, R, matrix):
        self._matrix = matrix
        self._V = V
        self._W = W
        self._codomain = R

    def __call__(self, v, w):
        v = self._V(v)
        w = self._W(w)
        return self._codomain(dot_product_wrt_matrix(v, w))

    def codomain(self):
        return self._codomain
```
Ideally it would inherit from `Morphism`, but we don't have tensor products of `FreeModule`s.

Also, I believe only the first check for a coercion between two objects should be slow and all other subsequent coercion checks between the same two parents are cached.
