This should return `True`

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: S.quo(x^2 + 1).coerce_map_from(R.quo(x^2 + 1)).is_injective()
```

Generally, if `R→S` is injective/surjective then the quotient is.

Keywords: sd86.5, sd87, beginner

A nice sufficient condition for injectivity is that the polynomial be monic (or more generally if its leading coefficient is a unit).

There are no problems with surjectivity.
