This patch will add "stronger properties" -line to seealso-block of is_constructible_by_doublings(). Not very nice, but I can't invent better way. Ideas are welcome.

What about "not"-implications? If a lattice *is* simple, it *is not* doubling constructible. How to say that, or to say nothing?

"Related properties" has slightly different meaning.

Of course we logically have no "yes"- and "no"-properties: we could have `is_nonmodular` that would imply `is_nondistributive` etc.

"Excluding properties"?
