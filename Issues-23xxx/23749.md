It was observed at #23707 that element classes do not correctly unpickle if the underlying base class changes from Python to Cython.

If P is a parent and P.Element is a Python class, then P.element_class is a dynamic class with bases P.Element and P.category().element_class. But if P.Element is a Cython class then currently (with not more than one exception) P.element_class is just P.Element.

If a pickle was created when P.Element was Python and later P.Element was changed to Cython, then the pickle still unpickles as dynamic class, whose bases are P.Element (now in Cython) and P.category().element_class. Problem: That is now different from P.element_class.

How to fix? When creating a dynamic class, one can provide a `reduction`, which here could be `(getattr, (P,'element_class'))`. Then, a pickle of `P.element_class` would always unpickle to `P.element_class`.

However, I see a potential problem: Dynamic classes are cached. The cache is a weak cache, but that just means a weak *value* cache. However, there will be a strong reference to the key of the dictionary, which includes the reduction data. Which means that caching of the dynamic class would prevent `P` from garbage collection: Memory leak.

Obvious solution: We shouldn't include the reduction data in the cache key.

The reduction data of an element class shouldn't be passed to the `dynamic_class` function, but should be assigned to the resulting class later, to circumvent the cache.

On the other hand, pickling by construction probably is *not* the correct thing to do. Namely, the dynamic element classes belonging to *different* parents in the same category can easily be identical. Hence, pickling-by-construction would have a bad consequence: Assume you first construct a parent A and then a parent B with identical element classes; then, pickle an element x of B; when unpickling x, not only B but also A would be reconstructed, because the type(x) (the common element class of A and B) was, at the time of first constructing x, defined as `getattr(A,'element_class')`.

I think building A when unpickling an element of B is a no-go. But unpickling a former dynamic Python element class as something that is *not* the element class after Cythonisation is a no-go as well.

Do you see a way out of that dilemma?
