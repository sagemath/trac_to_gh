The following should not give an error:

```
sage: N = Matroid(field=GF(3), reduced_matrix=[[1,1],[1,-1]])
sage: M = matroids.Uniform(2,4)
sage: N._isomorphism(M)
```
The problem is a non-absolute import statement.

However, I would say a better (well, at least cleaner IMO) idiom is to just import what you need

```diff

+            from .basis_matroid import BasisMatroid
