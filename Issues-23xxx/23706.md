The aim of this ticket is to revamp the `MatrixSpace` constructor in order to be able to choose the implementation.

For example, with the attached branch one can have access to 2 implementations of integer matrices

```
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3, implementation='flint')
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring
sage: MatrixSpace(ZZ, 3, implementation='generic')
Full MatrixSpace of 3 by 3 dense matrices over Integer Ring (using Matrix_generic_dense)
```

One important change is the move of the method `_get_matrix_class` of `MatrixSpace` as an independent function.

A problem arose with `CartanMatrix` (in `sage/combinat/root_system/cartan_matrix.py`). The class `CartanMatrix` inherits from `Matrix_integer_sparse` but does not properly redefines the parent. As a consequence of the changes here, many matrix operations are not valid anymore for inherited types (mostly submatrices operations such as `__getitem__` with slices or `stack`). A fix is provided by defining `CartanMatrix.matrix_space`.

follow up: #23714 (implementation of gap matrices)

Depends on #24096

Ok, I'm "back on trac"!

I'll give a look at this today.

Where should I throw in the benchmarking script? I guess it is not a good idea to hard code the best implementation, but at least, in the tests, we could add some relevant benchmarks to keep track of the evolution?

In the description of the test:

```

I would also mention that sparsity is checked ( the reason why there is no X appearing in row 2, column 3...)

The changes in the CartanMatrix look good.

In one of the bot's report, I get an error here:

Another option would be creating an appropriate string with `'\\n'.join(...)`. Similar for another test.\n\nThese tests should not be marked as meataxe if it really is using the generic implementation:\n\n```\n            sage: MS = MatrixSpace(M.base_ring(), M.nrows(), M.ncols(), implementation='generic')\n            sage: X = MS(M)                         # optional: meataxe\n            sage: type(X)                           # optional: meataxe\n            sage: X.echelon_form() # optional: meataxe\n```\nOtherwise that would be a bug.\n\nDo we want m4ri to have precedence over trying meataxe when no implementation is given? (I'm cc-ing Simon to note that there might be a change in behavior.)\n\nI'm also split on documenting about when we use a non-generic implementation by default. It feels too much like an implementation detail that it should be hidden from the more casual users, but I think it is good for the more advanced users to have it in the public doc. Thoughts?\n\nI'm also not 100% convinced about having to explicitly convert matrices of different implementations, but since things are likely to be incompatible and it seems unlikely that this would be a problem (I think a user who is choosing implementations will probably be careful and might even appreciate this error).

I have a few comments:

```diff

+    def matrix_space(self, nrows=None, ncols=None, sparse=True):
         r"""
         Return a matrix space over the integers.

-        if sparse is None:
-            sparse = True
 
         if nrows == self.nrows() and ncols == self.ncols() and sparse:
             return self.parent()
         else:
             from sage.matrix.matrix_space import MatrixSpace
             return MatrixSpace(ZZ, nrows, ncols, sparse is None or bool(sparse))
```

I would make this into a more 2/3 compatible test:

```
            sage: for i in range(3):
            ....:     for j in range(3):
            ....:         try:
            ....:             s = M[i].an_element() * M[j].an_element()
            ....:             print('X', end='')
            ....:         except TypeError:
            ....:             print(' ', end='')
            ....:     print()
```
I would instead create a 0/1-matrix and output that. Another option would be creating an appropriate string with `'\n'.join(...)`. Similar for another test.

These tests should not be marked as meataxe if it really is using the generic implementation:

```
            sage: MS = MatrixSpace(M.base_ring(), M.nrows(), M.ncols(), implementation='generic')
            sage: X = MS(M)                         # optional: meataxe
            sage: type(X)                           # optional: meataxe
            sage: X.echelon_form() # optional: meataxe
```
Otherwise that would be a bug.

Do we want m4ri to have precedence over trying meataxe when no implementation is given? (I'm cc-ing Simon to note that there might be a change in behavior.)

I'm also split on documenting about when we use a non-generic implementation by default. It feels too much like an implementation detail that it should be hidden from the more casual users, but I think it is good for the more advanced users to have it in the public doc. Thoughts?

I'm also not 100% convinced about having to explicitly convert matrices of different implementations, but since things are likely to be incompatible and it seems unlikely that this would be a problem (I think a user who is choosing implementations will probably be careful and might even appreciate this error). I do not have a good reason to make this an objection, but I am just noting that this might come up from a user.

> Do we want m4ri to have precedence over trying meataxe when no implementation is given? (I'm cc-ing Simon to note that there might be a change in behavior.)

There should not be any change. It concerns only the case `characteristic = 2`.

```
if implementation is None:
    if R.characteristic() == 2 and R.order() <= 65536:
        implementation = 'm4ri'
    elif R.order() <= 255:
        try:
            from . import matrix_gfpn_dense
        except ImportError:
            implementation = 'generic'
        else:
            implementation = 'meataxe'
    else:
        implementation = 'generic'
```
where it used to be

```
if R.characteristic() == 2:
    if R.order() <= 65536:
        return matrix_gf2e_dense.Matrix_gf2e_dense
elif R.order() <= 255:
    try:
        from . import matrix_gfpn_dense
        return matrix_gfpn_dense.Matrix_gfpn_dense
    except ImportError:
        pass

What would you expect exactly? It would be a nightmare to keep the documentation up to date.

It should be possible to implement coercion to the default implementation (with conversion). Anyway, I would like to keep such changes for later.

Right, actually I might have misread what meataxe is for and it's a non-issue because it is not meant for characteristic 2. Sorry for the noise.

Keeping it up to date would not be such a problem; at least I don't expect it to change that much. However, I tried a few different ways to present the info and nothing really worked too well. There's just a few too many little cases for the finite fields. I guess if someone cares enough they are good enough to just look at the code.

Thanks. Positive review.
