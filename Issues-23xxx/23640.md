Currently, `FractionWithFactoredDenominator.smooth_critical_ideal` accepts its variable names as symbolic entries. This is really strange, especially since no symbolic computations are done.

This should be deprecated and the variable names should be accepted as strings (or possibly variables from a pre-existing polynomial ring).

This is needed for #10483.

Minor nitpick about:

```
            # Coerce alpha into L.
            alpha = [L(a) for a in alpha]
```

Here you are doing a *conversion*, not a *coercion*. Either really do a coercion there or fix the comment.
