Currently, `FractionWithFactoredDenominator.smooth_critical_ideal` accepts its variable names as symbolic entries. This is really strange, especially since no symbolic computations are done.

This should be deprecated and the variable names should be accepted as strings (or possibly variables from a pre-existing polynomial ring).

This is needed for #10483.

I'm attaching a patch that I'm moving from #10483. One thing which is missing is the deprecation of the existing behaviour.

Minor nitpick about:

```
            # Coerce alpha into L.
            alpha = [L(a) for a in alpha]
```

Here you are doing a *conversion*, not a *coercion*. Either really do a coercion there or fix the comment.

            if isinstance(a, str) and a not in K.variable_names():
                indets.append(a)
```
There should be an error message, if some `a` is ignored (i.e., when it is not a string and not an existing variable).
