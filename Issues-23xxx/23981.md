Overwrite _mul_ in sage.modules.free_quadratic_modules

```
x*y
```
Instead of 

```
x.inner_product(y)
```
Is just so much nicer to read. 

And if one is in a `FreeQuadraticModule`, then one is not interested in the doc product anyways but rather in the defined inner product. 
If one really needs to, one can still use `x.dot_product()`

In retrospect this is a bad idea.
Consider for example a square matrix `B` and `x` in our free quadratic module
It is clear what
`x*B*x` should be.
But if `*` is also the inner product, then
`x*(B*x)` and `(x*B)*x` use the different inner product. This will cause a lot of trouble.
