This is more a question, I do not have checked how to actually do it.

An (Hermitian) positive semidefinite matrix M has a unique positive semidefinite square root T, this is, M = T^2.

I would like to have this square root implemented as I need it for some further computations. This is already possible numerically as in

```
sage: W = ReflectionGroup(['B',5])
sage: M = W.invariant_form()
sage: M
[ 1 -1  0  0  0]
[-1  2 -1  0  0]
[ 0 -1  2 -1  0]
[ 0  0 -1  2 -1]
[ 0  0  0 -1  2]

sage: D, S = M.eigenmatrix_right()
sage: S

[                   1                    1                    1                    1                    1]

sage: T = S*diagonal_matrix([sqrt(x) for x in D.diagonal()])*S^-1
sage: T^2 == M
True
sage: T.is_positive_definite()

sage: T.is_hermitian()

```
I wonder whether this guarantees the matrix square root to be positive definite whenever one starts with a positive definite matrix.

In this and a few other examples it actually is, but the documentation does not say anything about it.

<a id='comment:4'></a>IMHO it is more of a mathematical question whether you get a p.s.d. T.

In the basis of the columns of S, one has the quadratic form, given by M in the standard basis, diagonal, given by D, with nonnegative entries (i.e. M=SDS<sup>-1</sup>).
The square root T is a power series in M, and thus given by T=SD<sup>1/2</sup>S<sup>-1</sup>, 
a p.s.d. matrix with eigenvalues given by D<sup>1/2</sup>, thus all positive whenever D>0.

What can still go wrong is that T is not equal to T<sup>*</sup>. 

However we know that D=D<sup>*</sup> and so M<sup>*</sup>=M=SDS<sup>-1</sup>=S<sup>*-1</sup>DS<sup>*</sup>, implying S<sup>*</sup>SD=DS<sup>*</sup>S.
Thus any power of D commutes with S<sup>*</sup>S, thus S<sup>*</sup>SD<sup>1/2</sup>=D<sup>1/2</sup>S<sup>*</sup>S implying T=T<sup>*</sup>.

Anything I still miss?
