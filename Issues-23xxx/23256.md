Check out [the graph of tangent](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/?z=eJwryMkv0ShJzNOo0NTRqNDRLcjUN9IBEZo6Kaklqckl8QX5OanFturFGfnl6jqVuZl5trpGQDqxwtZIEwCDjxRd&lang=sage) with `detect_poles=True`:

```
plot(tan(x),(x,-pi/2,pi/2),detect_poles='show',ymin=-2,ymax=2)
```

Ideas?  Probably this doesn't lie too deep in the code.  Note that with `detect_poles='show'` there is no problem.
