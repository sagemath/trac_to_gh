[This commit](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?h=2179ac895c8d8aa9611837a0f5384199e526bd3a&id=dc46ea2dfa97be79d7ef8ddbe9130d4c717acc3d) broke the build of Python 2 on Cygwin by moving the definition of the `PYTHON_VERSION` variable used for the Cygwin install as well as OSX.

I didn't notice before since I was just doing incremental builds.
