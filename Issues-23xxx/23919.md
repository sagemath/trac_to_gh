Fix a default version of the C and C++ standard to compile the Sage library with and avoid GNU extensions.

The reason is that different C/C++ compilers come with different standards as default (older GCC defaults to C89 and C++98, newer GCC defaults to C11 and C++14, all with GNU extensions, and I have no idea what Clang does). Explicitly adding a `-std=` flag will hide those differences.

I suggest to default to C99 and C++11 because those are the versions which are already explicitly listed in a few places. So choosing those versions would also reduce some clutter in `module_list.py`. And given that we can already use `-std=c99` and `-std=c++11`, we know that our compilers support that.

This breaks for the lcalc package due to the known issue #23341: we add `-std=gnu++98` for that specific module.

OK, I diagnosed this.

Linbox really needs GNU extensions, it compiles with `-std=gnu++11` but not with `-std=c++11`.

When building Linbox, it checks for C++11 support. With GCC 5.x, a flag is required to add C++11 support. By default, `configure` tries `-std=gnu++11` first. So, the `-std=gnu++11` flag is added to the `CXXFLAGS` of Linbox, which is propagated to the Sage library using the pkgconfig mechanism.

When building Linbox with GCC 6 or 7, the default is `-std=gnu++11` (or `-std=gnu++14` but that difference doesn't matter here). So Linbox doesn't add any `-std` flag to `CXXFLAGS`. Now this ticket sees that no `-std` flag is added, so it adds `-std=c++11` which breaks Linbox.

It is actually tricky to do because the m4 macros that looks for support for C99 and C++11/14 do not return  a flag. They return a new value for CC/CXX, the needed flag, if any,  is not easily accessible from the macro.

To make it even worse: Givaro (which is the real culprint here) uses `std=gnu++11` with gcc but switches to `std=c++11` when compiling with clang. This is due to a sequence of bugs as explained there:
https://github.com/linbox-team/givaro/issues/47

Surprinsingly, `--std=c++11` does not make the compilation fail with clang.
Therefore, one should be carefull not to "force" the `gnu++11` flag, although in the context of sage compilation, it may be a safe assumption that we are using gcc.

I take note that Givaro/FFLAS-FFPACK/LinBox should be more consistent in the c++11 flag that they expose in their .pc file. Since LinBox depends on FFLAS which depends on Givaro, I would preferably only state the c++11 flag in Givaro.
However, I was told [1] not to pollute the CFLAGS field in pkgconfig with anything else than preprocessor flags (-I and -D and -U).
