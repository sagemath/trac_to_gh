sage: (ZZ**3)(pari([1,2,3]))
...
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
```
and

```
sage: (ZZ^3)(i for i in range(3))
...
TypeError: can't initialize vector from nonzero non-list
```

Together with #20211, the aim is to have the following construction supported

```
sage: K = CyclotomicField(10)
sage: z = K.gen()
sage: M = MatrixSpace(K, 2)
sage: m = M([1, z, 1-z, -2/3])
sage: p = m.__pari__()
sage: r = p^2 - 2*p + 3
sage: M(r)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: ... has unsupported PARI type t_MAT
```
  (in the above example `r.sage()` does fail with `NameError: name 'y' is not defined`)
