This ticket will introduce a flag `latex_format` into `print_options` to indicate that latex output of indexed terms in algebras should be displayed in a more compact form.

Some combinatorial Hopf algebras will set this flag through a method `set_print_style`.  This allows for cleaner display output in notebooks and pasted latex.  In particular, the latex output of sf, ncsym, ncsym dual, ncsf, qsym will all have a compact display option.

The way options are set up in combinatorial objects is less than ideal at the moment for this sort of implementation, but I like the idea.

So I could add `latex_format` (of type str) in the print options instead of `latex_compact` (of type bool) in the print_options.  Let me take what would happen with an algebra indexed by Permutations as an example (since it would be a high priority for the next CHA to be implemented).

Would you suggest that there is potentially a method (in this case `cycle_string`, `_latex_compact`, etc.) format within each relevant `CombinatorialElement` and then if the `latex_format` option is set to something other than `None` it attempts to call the appropriate representation?

I think for the changes that I would want to make here I would implement a method `_latex_compact` in `Partitions`, `SetPartitions` and `Compositions` and then in `_latex_generator` from `structure.indexed_generators.py` will try to call the relevant latex method if `latex_format` is not `None`.

<div id="comment:8" align="right">Comment 8</div>

I did modify `IndexedGenerators` and added the flag `'latex_format'` in the end because I think it is used appropriately there.  If `'latex_format'` is set to some function, then `_latex_generator` uses that to latex the subscript, otherwise it uses the default latex function.

For NCSym, NCSymD, NCSF and QSym I defined a method `set_print_style` (in the algebra and the bases) which allows the user to specify the options `'latex_short'`, `'latex_compact'` and `'latex_default'`

On Sym I modified the existing `set_print_style` to allow `'latex_compact'` and `'latex_default'` as additional options (there is already a 'short' display that is the default) and then added a `set_print_style` method in Sym which sets the value for all bases.

I've tried this out on the Jupyter notebook with latex output and an expression like 

```
%display latex
NCSym = SymmetricFunctionsNonCommutingVariables(QQ)
NCSym.inject_shorthands(verbose=False)
NCSym.set_print_style('latex_compact')
m[[1,2],[4],[3,5]]^2
```
