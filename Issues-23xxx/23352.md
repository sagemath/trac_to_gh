I just noticed that, when meataxe is installed and its Sage wrapper is used for matrices over `GF(p^n)` with `p` odd and `p^n<255`, then at least in some cases the random matrices aren't sufficiently random:

```
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      x 2*x + 1   x + 2   x + 2       0]
[  x + 1       x   x + 2   x + 1       0]
[  x + 1       2   x + 1       2       0]
[      x     2*x       x   x + 1       0]
[2*x + 1       0 2*x + 1 2*x + 2       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      2   x + 1   x + 1 2*x + 2       0]
[      x 2*x + 2   x + 2     2*x       0]
[  x + 2     2*x       0 2*x + 2       0]
[    2*x       2       2       1       0]
[  x + 2       2     2*x       1       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      2 2*x + 1       x 2*x + 1       0]
[2*x + 2       0 2*x + 2       x       0]
[      2       x 2*x + 1   x + 2       0]
[      0 2*x + 1       x       x       0]
[      1       1       2   x + 1       0]
sage: random_matrix(GF(9,'x'), 5)
[      x   x + 1       0       0       0]
[      1   x + 1       0 2*x + 1       0]
[      2       0       x   x + 2       0]
[      2       0   x + 1   x + 2       0]
[      x   x + 1     2*x       1       0]
```
So, the last column always is zero, which shouldn't be the case.

<a id='comment:2'></a>The matrix entries are densely packed in meataxe. Hence, in some situations, the last byte of a row in memory is only partly filled with data. And in fact the HIGHEST bits of the last byte have to be filled.

The problem was: In the old code, the LOWEST bits of the last byte have been filled.

I fixed it by explicitly assigning random numbers to the last few entries (instead of trying to fill a whole block of entries).

That's not quite what I said. I proposed to split up #21437. Adding more stuff to existing tickets (like this one) is actually the opposite of what I intented.

Do you prefer that I rebase again and split this ticket into three: One for the new MeatAxe patch (that avoids frequent calls to a C function and thus gives a speedup), one for the pickling and one for random matrices?

The first one is #23410.

The patches to be distributed are, as much as I see, independent. Would it be better to let the new tickets build upon each other (i.e., the git history of one ticket is included in the git history of the other tickets), or should they stay separate (i.e., each ticket provides a patch, and then they are merged only when needed)?

If I'm reading the documentation at http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~MTX/doc24/group__ff.html correctly, it should be the LOWEST bytes:

Yes, that's what I had in mind, too, and is why I wrote the old code in the way I did. Anyway, I am now using meataxe's `FfInsert`, which should do the right thing.

Let's test: If I would set the last byte inconsistent with meataxe's conventions, then multiplying a matrix with the transposed matrix (these are all using meataxe functions) would give a wrong result. 

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(9,'x'),1,5)
sage: def sanity_check(M):
....:     assert (M*M.transpose())[0,0] == add(e*e for e in M.list())
....:     
sage: while(1):
....:     sanity_check(MS.random_element())
....:     
```
works without error. Note that in the setting above, the new code is called. Thus, I believe my code is correct and indeed the meataxe documentation provides a wrong statement.

<a id='comment:27'></a>After replacing sig_on/off by sig_check, I get

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(9,'x'),5,17)
sage: %timeit MS.random_element()
The slowest run took 146.35 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 3.05 µs per loop
```
That's further 10% on top of the previous 35%.

That's slightly surprising to me. Is sig_on/off really resulting in a massive slow-down? Then why is it used? After all, another disadvantage is that it doesn't play well with Python code.

It shouldn't result in a *massive* slowdown. However, if you are using it in a very tight loop, the time taken by `sig_on()` is noticable.
