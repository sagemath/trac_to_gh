It would be nice if the following behavior:

```
sage: R.<u> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: z = u^3 + u^6 - u^7
sage: z.O(7)
u^3 + u^6 + O(u^7)
```
were also available for Laurent series rings (as a synonym for `add_bigoh`). As it stands:

```
sage: R.<u> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: z = u^3 + u^6 - u^7
sage: z.O(7)

I implemented `O` for Laurent series as just a synonym for `add_bigoh`, which already existed for Laurent series.

I might be missing something, because for power series, `O` and `add_bigoh` are implemented seperately, one does not call the other.

Thank you for your comments!

Replying to [@videlec](#comment%3A4):
> Three small things
> 
> - typo: `precission`

I fixed this typo.
> - what does mean `got by adding`?

This means adding the zero series with the specified precision, I expanded the docstring explaining this.
> - According to the [sage developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) the documentation should start with a one-line summary and then a longer description. Could you try to split?

I split and expanded the docstring.

Modulo this, I'm prepared to give a positive review.

I tried using my local patchbot to test this ticket, but it failed because I am on MacOS and have this problem with [Xcode 9.0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/sage-devel/xf7DZrc6Dos/WKkNT-TaAwAJ), and I need #12426 (using clang instead of gcc) to compile sage, which my patchbot did not use.

Does this prevent other patchbots from trying to test this ticket? If so, can I undo this?
