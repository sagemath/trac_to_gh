It would be nice if the following behavior:

```
sage: R.<u> = PowerSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: z = u^3 + u^6 - u^7
sage: z.O(7)
u^3 + u^6 + O(u^7)
```
were also available for Laurent series rings (as a synonym for `add_bigoh`). As it stands:

```
sage: R.<u> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: z = u^3 + u^6 - u^7
sage: z.O(7)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a id='comment:2'></a>I implemented `O` for Laurent series as just a synonym for `add_bigoh`, which already existed for Laurent series.

I might be missing something, because for power series, `O` and `add_bigoh` are implemented seperately, one does not call the other.

- According to the [sage developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) the documentation should start with a one-line summary and then a longer description. Could you try to split?

I fixed this typo.

This means adding the zero series with the specified precision, I expanded the docstring explaining this.
> - According to the [sage developer manual](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) the documentation should start with a one-line summary and then a longer description. Could you try to split?
 
I split and expanded the docstring.
