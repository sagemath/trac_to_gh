consider the following with Sage 8.0:

```
sage: abs(-RDF(0))
-0.0
sage: abs(-RR(0))
0.000000000000000
```
This is inconsistent. The second result seems to be the correct one:

```
$ cat e.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main()
{
  double x = 0.0, y = -x, z = fabs (y);
  printf ("x=%f y=%f z=%f\n", x, y, z);
}
zimmerma@tomate:/tmp$ gcc e.c -lm && ./a.out 
x=0.000000 y=-0.000000 z=0.000000
```

<a id='comment:5'></a>however we still have in 8.2:

```
sage: (-RDF(0)).abs()
-0.0
sage: (-RR(0)).abs()
0.000000000000000

Should I open a new ticket for that?
