because "cmp" is going to disappear in py3

currently, symbolic expressions use "cmp" for something that tries to define a total order on expressions.

Let us deprecate this. People needing this kind of thing can either

* call "mixed_order" directly
* or try to use something like "bool(a <= b)"

Sure thing! One could offer a method for `Expression`, definitely not named `cmp`, but it's not important.
