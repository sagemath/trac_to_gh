The current documentation for the catalog of codes `codes` in `sage.coding.codes_catalog` doesn't include the classes. This is because the table is auto-generated using `sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods`. I propose manually adding a table for the classes and auto-generating the rest; this makes the classes stand out in the documentation, as they are substantially richer objects than the remaining codes (which are merely generator matrices).

At the same time, the documentation for the decoder catalog and the encoder catalog could be made more humane by providing a readable name for each decoder (these tables are already manually updated).

Component: **coding theory**
