For the research problem LP, but it can work the same way for a MILP.

Looks like IPO now has a cython interface too. We should get this package into sage.

SCIP is just one implementation that it can use. There's also a way to just hook in a Python callback as the oracle implementation. (Haven't tested this myself.)
