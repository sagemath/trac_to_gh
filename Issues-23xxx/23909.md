Some of the sagemath packages we use requires us to compute the GCD of univariate polynomials whose coefficient ring is the fraction field of multivariate polynomials over integral domains like Z, e.g: polynomials in the ring Frac(Z[x,y])[z]. 
\\
Right now in Sagemath if we run  the following example, the regular Euclidean algorithm implemented in rings.py for computing gcd is called. It is very slow and the implementation hangs for degrees >4. 
\\
**Example :**
\\
sage: A.<x,y>=ZZ[]
\\
sage: B= Frac(A)
\\
sage: C.<z> = B[]
\\
sage: p = C.random_element(6)
\\
sage: q = C.random_element(6)
\\
sage: gcd(p,q)
\\
Hangs!
\\
**Reason for the function to hang :** It repeatedly has to call the multiplication function which calls  the gcd function in multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx and therefore is slow. 
\\
**Proposed Change:** Add a new function _gcd_univariate_polynomial()  inside the class, class FractionField_generic(ring.Field). It can be found in /src/sage/rings/fraction_field.py.

This change breaks many gcd computations that now work.  For example

```
sage: Q.<x> = B[]
sage: F = Q.fraction_field()
sage: R.<y> = F[]
sage: f = (y + x)^2 * (y - 1/x)^3
sage: g = (y + x)^4 * (y - 1/x)^2
sage: gcd(f,g)
```
When `B` is `ZZ` or `Zmod(5)` or `GaussianIntegers()`, we get answers in Sage as it is. With your change, all of them raise a `TypeError` on some internal `gcd` call.

Moreover, the result of `gcd` should be in the same ring as the arguments.  We do not always get that with this change.

Hi Maria,

As it turns out, most of the necessary work had already been done in the implementation of `gcd()` for polynomials over polynomial rings. Here is a simpler implementation that takes advantage of that.

(Sorry that it took me so incredibly long to have a stab at this as promised!)
