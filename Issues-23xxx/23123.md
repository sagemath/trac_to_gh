Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

Given the large number of files which need to be changed, this is done in parts.

---

This part deals with Graph theory (the `src/sage/graphs` directory) and is more involved than the other parts because there are more dubious/bad uses of the signal functions. So in addition to fixing the imports, some code is changed.

Two tickets have been split off:

1. The file `boost_graph.pyx` was quite bad and required many fixes: #23124.

2. The file `matchpoly.pyx` has a bug which happens to be triggered only when "fixing" some part of the code: #23126.
