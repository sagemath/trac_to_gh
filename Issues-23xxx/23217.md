Sometimes when I build yasm in clean install with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` one or two tests fail.  I've repeated this a few times and the failures I've seen are:

```
[yasm-1.3.0] FAIL: modules/preprocs/raw/tests/rawpp_test.sh
[yasm-1.3.0] FAIL: modules/objfmts/elf/tests/x32/elf_x32_test.sh
[yasm-1.3.0] FAIL: modules/objfmts/elf/tests/amd64/elf_amd64_test.sh
```

Sometimes it passes with no failures.  My guess is it's more likely a problem with the tests than anything to do with Sage, but thought I'd make a note of it.

I also got a failure in the rawpp_test.sh one once.
