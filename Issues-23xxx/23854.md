sage: gap.StrongGeneratorsStabChain
StrongGeneratorsStabChain
sage: libgap.StrongGeneratorsStabChain
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: StrongGeneratorsStabChain.
```

As a workaround, this is available through

```
sage: S = libgap.SymmetricGroup(5)
sage: T = libgap.eval('StabChain')(S)
sage: libgap.eval('StrongGeneratorsStabChain')(T)
[ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ]
```

The list is long

```
sage: len(set(dir(gap)).difference(dir(libgap)))
11254
```

dir(gap)}}} alone seems to return more stuff than needed (constants and the like). \\

There is a list from gap's jupyter syntax highliting ([https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel/blob/master/etc/gap-mode/gap.js here]).
Should we include function names from gap packages or rather do like gap's jupyter syntax highliting ? (Only 1823 new function names in the later case).

I did not investigate anything. This is just empirical constatation.

I think that this list could be obtained directly from GAP/libGAP (at execution time).
