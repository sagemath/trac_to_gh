A dramatic slowdown is obtained with algorithm related to modular symbols because of the misbehavior of flint echelon algorithm on very specific inputs (see comments 21 to 26 in #22970). This ticket built on top of #22970 introduce some way to deal with the default echelon algorithm used in a given portion of code.
