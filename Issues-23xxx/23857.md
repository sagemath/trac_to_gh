In order to clean up the wrapping of C++ code, we need proper conversion of C++ objects to and from Python strings. This is currently done in a hacky way in `ccobject.h` but it can be done more cleanly using Cython's support for C++ templates.

In particular, we implement:
- `ccrepr()` to convert any C++ object to `str`
- `ccreadstr()` to convert a `str` to a C++ object

We intentionally use the words `repr` and `read` because this is using string input/output (operators `<<` and `>>`).

Moreover, this new function will support both Python 2 and Python 3. In the latter case, the filesystem encoding is used.
