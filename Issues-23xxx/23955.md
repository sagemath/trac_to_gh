Maybe this causes further bugs.

Most of my changes were superficial, but I did find what I thought was a typo.  You used to have

```
if left_neighbor == 1 or symbol[i] == 1 or right_neighbor==1:
```
which I changed to

```
if left_neighbor == 1 or symbol[i][3] == 1 or right_neighbor==1:
```
based on context.  If this is correct, you're happy with the rest of my changes, and tests pass, positive review.

Thank you for the changes. It is a lot cleaner now.
