<a id='comment:18'></a>Okay, something in my configuration had gotten messed up, so I started over entirely. I just pulled the latest version of this branch (`5f99cf980c`), which has the content of #23204 already merged in, merged in the latest develop branch (`74b03027bc`), and rebuilt. I then ran the following limited set of doctests and got these results:

```bash
bash-3.2$ ./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/structure/ src/sage/categories/ src/sage/rings/ src/sage/modular/ src/sage/schemes/

too few successful tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2017-07-21-16-33-34-b8fb451a.

sage -t --long src/sage/tests/cmdline.py  # 4 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

However! When I run these same doctests on my latest build of the develop branch (`74b03027bc`), the exact same tests also fail. 

Therefore, I'm going to positively review this ticket -- if others think this is a problem they are welcome to revert the status as they see fit.
