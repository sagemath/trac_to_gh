I just updated #23204 to fix typos in two of the doctest.  If you are getting a two failures, you might try checking out the updated ticket.

Okay, something in my configuration had gotten messed up, so I started over entirely. I just pulled the latest version of this branch (`5f99cf980c`), which has the content of #23204 already merged in, merged in the latest develop branch (`74b03027bc`), and rebuilt. I then ran the following limited set of doctests and got these results:

```bash
bash-3.2$ ./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/structure/ src/sage/categories/ src/sage/rings/ src/sage/modular/ src/sage/schemes/

too few successful tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2017-07-21-16-33-34-b8fb451a.

Using --optional=ccache,mpir,python2,sage
Sorting sources by runtime so that slower doctests are run first....

I just merged the latest version of #23204 (`382e2d1807`) into the latest version of this ticket (`5f99cf980c`), rebuilt, and reran the same limited set of tests (`./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/structure/ src/sage/categories/ src/sage/rings/ src/sage/modular/ src/sage/schemes/`) which all passed!

I am now running all doctests.

I just ran all tests in `src/sage` and produced only the following weird failed tests:

```bash
$ ./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/
too few successful tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2017-07-22-12-22-47-8f9951fd.
Git branch: t/23203/a_polynomial_ring_contains_its_basering
Using --optional=ccache,mpir,python2,sage
Sorting sources by runtime so that slower doctests are run first....
Doctesting 2969 files using 8 threads.
