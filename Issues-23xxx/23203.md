I just updated #23204 to fix typos in two of the doctest.  If you are getting a two failures, you might try checking out the updated ticket.

Okay, something in my configuration had gotten messed up, so I started over entirely. I just pulled the latest version of this branch (`5f99cf980c`), which has the content of #23204 already merged in, merged in the latest develop branch (`74b03027bc`), and rebuilt. I then ran the following limited set of doctests and got these results:

```bash
bash-3.2$ ./sage -tp 8 --long src/sage/structure/ src/sage/categories/ src/sage/rings/ src/sage/modular/ src/sage/schemes/

too few successful tests, not using stored timings
Running doctests with ID 2017-07-21-16-33-34-b8fb451a.
