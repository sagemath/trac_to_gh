After #23706 it appears that different implementations do not provide the same randomization algorithms. This is annoying for accurate comparisons

```
sage: with seed(42):
....:     MatrixSpace(QQ, 2, implementation='flint').random_element()
[  -1   -1]
[-1/2    2]
sage: with seed(42):
....:     MatrixSpace(QQ, 2, implementation='gap').random_element()
[ 1/4 -4/3]
[   1    0]
sage: with seed(42):
....:     MatrixSpace(QQ, 2, implementation='generic').random_element()
[ 1/4 -4/3]
[   1    0]
```
The same occurs over cyclotomic field. The reason is that there is a home made `randomize` method in these cases.
