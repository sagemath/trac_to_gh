As a preparation step to py3:

**One important change**: allows any doctest to pass if sage returns u'blabla' and the doctest requires 'blabla'

This is done by a parsing that calls an internal method of cython.

This parsing  may not be perfect, but works in most simple enough cases.

1. From the patch:

```
But this breaks on something like "[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']" !!!
```

You may want to consider using [strip_string_literals](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L277) for a more robust implementation.

2. The `[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']` example should be a doctest (depending on your opinion on 1, either to show that it works or to show how it breaks).

3. Revert this:

```diff

The `import *` is intentional: the idea is that `sage.misc.six` can replace the standard `six` module.

4. Since the commits don't really make sense, I suggest to squash this to 1 commit.

I don't think the level of complexity in this is really necessary (making sure a closing quote is found, etc.).  Astropy's doctest checker just uses a [simple regex](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/astropy/tests/output_checker.py#L43) which, given knowledge of Python syntax and typical `repr`s of Python objects, is almost always going to be a positive match.  It's true one can come up with examples where it would be a false positive but I don't think it's ever occurred in practice.

That said, Sage has a lot more doctests and a lot more odd cases, and you've already worked out a way to do this that's perhaps more robust so I wouldn't toss it out if it works.  I would just eliminate the code duplication, perhaps by making an inline function, like:

```python
def strip_u_prefix(s, q):
    prefix = 'u' + q
    initial = s.split(prefix)
    parity = 0
    final = []
    for part in initial:
        parity += part.count(q)
        final.append(part)
        if parity % 2:
            final.append(prefix)
        else:
            final.append(q)
        parity += 1
    return u''.join(final[:-1])

s = strip_u_prefix(s, '"')
return strip_u_prefix(s, "'")
```

or something like that.

I'd be surprised if this really had any impact on speed in the grand scheme of things.  In a full test run it might add up to a few seconds.  But if you can demonstrate otherwise, a simple regexp as I suggested above might mitigate somewhat.

I think it's simpler to apply this on all tests by default since it's very easy to forget otherwise, but there should probably be an option to disable it on a specific test in the rare case where it removes a false positive.

I would argue the opposite: if you can re-use an existing function which does most of the work, things become *less* complicated.

I must add that I haven't actually checked if `strip_string_literals` can be used. But if yes, that seems the way to go.

What I mean is that when you have some code that parses output from doctests, one can sometimes stumble upon corner cases where it doesn't work properly for a test you're working on. So it's convenient to be able to easily tweak the code in the rare instances that that occurs.  Of course it is usually rare, but I write from experience on this.

I disagree with everything else--I don't think it's wise to be cherry-picking random code from other Python packages that are not designed as libraries to be used by third-parties.  But it's ultimately up to Frédéric if he's doing the work.

Here is a branch, on top of Jeroen's branch, that does not try the systematic replacement. I propose to do that later in another ticket, because there are some  issues in relation with our unicode-unfriendly doc-framework.
