As a preparation step to py3:

**One important change**: allows any doctest to pass if sage returns u'blabla' and the doctest requires 'blabla'

This is done by a parsing that calls an internal method of cython.

This parsing  may not be perfect, but works in most simple enough cases.

1. From the patch:

```
But this breaks on something like "[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']" !!!
```

You may want to consider using [strip_string_literals](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L277) for a more robust implementation.

2. The `[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']` example should be a doctest (depending on your opinion on 1, either to show that it works or to show how it breaks).

3. Revert this:

The `import *` is intentional: the idea is that `sage.misc.six` can replace the standard `six` module.

I was thinking to 2 things:

1) do not spend more time in the doctests

2) the failing doctests in python3 can be cared of somewhere else (how many are there ?)

I don't think the level of complexity in this is really necessary (making sure a closing quote is found, etc.).  Astropy's doctest checker just uses a [simple regex](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/master/astropy/tests/output_checker.py#L43) which, given knowledge of Python syntax and typical `repr`s of Python objects, is almost always going to be a positive match.  It's true one can come up with examples where it would be a false positive but I don't think it's ever occurred in practice.

That said, Sage has a lot more doctests and a lot more odd cases, and you've already worked out a way to do this that's perhaps more robust so I wouldn't toss it out if it works.  I would just eliminate the code duplication, perhaps by making an inline function, like:

```python
def strip_u_prefix(s, q):
    prefix = 'u' + q
    initial = s.split(prefix)
    parity = 0
    final = []
    for part in initial:
        parity += part.count(q)
        final.append(part)
        if parity % 2:
            final.append(prefix)
        else:
            final.append(q)
        parity += 1
    return u''.join(final[:-1])

s = strip_u_prefix(s, '"')
return strip_u_prefix(s, "'")
```

or something like that.

I'd be surprised if this really had any impact on speed in the grand scheme of things.  In a full test run it might add up to a few seconds.  But if you can demonstrate otherwise, a simple regexp as I suggested above might mitigate somewhat.

I think it's simpler to apply this on all tests by default since it's very easy to forget otherwise, but there should probably be an option to disable it on a specific test in the rare case where it removes a false positive.

I would argue the opposite: if you can re-use an existing function which does most of the work, things become *less* complicated.

I must add that I haven't actually checked if `strip_string_literals` can be used. But if yes, that seems the way to go.

Normally I would agree of course, but not in the case of an undocumented function, buried in Cython's internals, which I don't believe guarantee a stable API of any sort.  I don't think it's a good idea to rely on miscellaneous undocumented functions somewhere in another package that isn't all that related to what you're actually using it for (granted, at least in Cython's case, it is related to parsing Python).

I think if, for this case, one wanted to reuse some existing machinery the stdlib's [ast](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast-helpers) module would be a better choice.

But I still think that's overkill for this purpose, where in my experience as simple regexp has almost always worked.

On a final note, for something like checking doctest output you also want a lot more immediate control over the details, since there *are* bound to be corner cases eventually.

I disagree with `ast` since that's almost certainly going to be a lot slower. I believe that `strip_string_literals()` is the right tool for the job.

What I mean is that when you have some code that parses output from doctests, one can sometimes stumble upon corner cases where it doesn't work properly for a test you're working on. So it's convenient to be able to easily tweak the code in the rare instances that that occurs.  Of course it is usually rare, but I write from experience on this.

I disagree with everything else--I don't think it's wise to be cherry-picking random code from other Python packages that are not designed as libraries to be used by third-parties.  But it's ultimately up to Frédéric if he's doing the work.

Yes, the only reason to put an import inside a function definition is in special cases, such as where use of that function will be rare and a possibly expensive import should be avoided if not needed, or where it's needed to avoid a circular import or something like that.
