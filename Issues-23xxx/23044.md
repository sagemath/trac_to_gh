As a preparation step to py3:

**One important change**: allows any doctest to pass if sage returns u'blabla' and the doctest requires 'blabla'

This is done by a parsing that calls an internal method of cython.

This parsing  may not be perfect, but works in most simple enough cases.

<a id='comment:11'></a>1. From the patch:

```
But this breaks on something like "[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']" !!!
```

You may want to consider using [strip_string_literals](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L277) for a more robust implementation.

2. The `[u"Singular's stuff", u'good']` example should be a doctest (depending on your opinion on 1, either to show that it works or to show how it breaks).

3. Revert this:

The `import *` is intentional: the idea is that `sage.misc.six` can replace the standard `six` module.

4. Since the commits don't really make sense, I suggest to squash this to 1 commit.

I would argue the opposite: if you can re-use an existing function which does most of the work, things become *less* complicated.

I must add that I haven't actually checked if `strip_string_literals` can be used. But if yes, that seems the way to go.

Normally I would agree of course, but not in the case of an undocumented function, buried in Cython's internals, which I don't believe guarantee a stable API of any sort.  I don't think it's a good idea to rely on miscellaneous undocumented functions somewhere in another package that isn't all that related to what you're actually using it for (granted, at least in Cython's case, it is related to parsing Python).

I think if, for this case, one wanted to reuse some existing machinery the stdlib's [ast](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast-helpers) module would be a better choice.

But I still think that's overkill for this purpose, where in my experience as simple regexp has almost always worked.

On a final note, for something like checking doctest output you also want a lot more immediate control over the details, since there *are* bound to be corner cases eventually.

While there is no *guarantee*, we can rely on it as long as Cython provides that function. For the record: that function has existed for almost 7 years with the current functionality. In the case that Cython moves/deletes/changes that function, we can always adapt Sage. In the worst case, we just copy that function to the Sage sources.

I disagree with `ast` since that's almost certainly going to be a lot slower. I believe that `strip_string_literals()` is the right tool for the job.

What I mean is that when you have some code that parses output from doctests, one can sometimes stumble upon corner cases where it doesn't work properly for a test you're working on. So it's convenient to be able to easily tweak the code in the rare instances that that occurs.  Of course it is usually rare, but I write from experience on this.

I disagree with everything else--I don't think it's wise to be cherry-picking random code from other Python packages that are not designed as libraries to be used by third-parties.  But it's ultimately up to Frédéric if he's doing the work.
