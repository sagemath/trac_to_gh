Do you know which binaries have this problem? All of them or only a certain subset?

At a minimum, can you point to one specific problematic binary in order to test things?

I would guess all of them, from the number of crash reports we get on a regular basis.

I edited the ticket description adding a link to a sage-support search for [ Sage_crash_report.txt ].

Users don't always provide details of which Linux distribution they are using, but some do.

I don't think the IPython post-mortem reports they attach inform us on what binary was used.
