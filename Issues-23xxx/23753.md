The sage-support mailing list gets [numerous crash reports](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-support/Sage_crash_report.txt%7Csort:date) from users having installed
SageMath from binaries for Linux, and seeing Sage crash when first started, with a crash log
containing a long traceback ending with an import error about libgfortran not being found,
typically:

```
ImportError: libgfortran.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Do you know which binaries have this problem? All of them or only a certain subset?

At a minimum, can you point to one specific problematic binary in order to test things?

I would guess all of them, from the number of crash reports we get on a regular basis.

I edited the ticket description adding a link to a sage-support search for [ Sage_crash_report.txt ].

Users don't always provide details of which Linux distribution they are using, but some do.

I don't think the IPython post-mortem reports they attach inform us on what binary was used.
