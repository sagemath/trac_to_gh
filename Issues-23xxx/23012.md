This can be solved by moving the implementation of `_gcd_univariate_polynomial()` and `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial()` from the `Fields` class to the `ParentMethods` of the category of Fields.

Hi Jeroen,

Hmm that's annoying. The idiom was already rather ugly. The new idiom is certainly more correct but no nicer :-)

Wondering if we could do better. What's the original motivation for calling gcd from `EuclideanDomains`?

Right, I only wanted to solve the direct problem. I did not think of the bigger picture.
