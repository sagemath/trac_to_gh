This can be solved by moving the implementation of `_gcd_univariate_polynomial()` and `_xgcd_univariate_polynomial()` from the `Fields` class to the `ParentMethods` of the category of Fields.

Hi Jeroen,

Hmm that's annoying. The idiom was already rather ugly. The new idiom is certainly more correct but no nicer :-)

Wondering if we could do better. What's the original motivation for calling gcd from `EuclideanDomains`?

Let me check if I got it right. The new version branch moves the `*gcd_polynomials` from the (legacy) abstract classes `Field` and `Ring` to their counterpart. They were not particularly Cythonized so this should not have an impact on performance, and this reduces some duplication (and I like moving stuff out of those classes).

There remain a piece of duplication between the generic implementation of gcd of `EuclideanDomains`, and that used in `Rings.ParentMethods.gcd_polynomial`, but it's just a few lines and your point is that it's not worth paying the price of the complication of faking being in `EuclideanDomains`.

Right?

Replying to [@nthiery](#comment:10):
> There remain a piece of duplication between the generic implementation of gcd of `EuclideanDomains`, and that used in `Rings.ParentMethods.gcd_polynomial`, but it's just a few lines and your point is that it's not worth paying the price of the complication of faking being in `EuclideanDomains`.

I didn't look at this particular thing, so I'm not making a point here. The only thing that I am changing is the implementation of `_(x)gcd_univariate_polynomial` for fields.
