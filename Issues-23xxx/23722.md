As discussed on [zulip](https://zulip.sagemath.org/#narrow/stream/padics/topic/pool), we propose to implement a pool for p-adic numbers.

I attach a first rough implementation that works only for CR elements.

The speed up is about 50% (= 2 times faster) for `Zp(p)` when p is small.

Probably. But the pool for `Integer` has additional optimizations.
Moreover, it uses global variables (instead of classes) and is then faster.

> 2. The most convenient by far would be to extend [@freelib Cython decorator](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html#fast-instantiation). 

Well, in my implementation, the parent plays some role (we have access to the pool through the parent and may enable/disable the pool for different parents using the same element class). It seems to be difficult to introduce these features in the `@freelib` decorator since parents are typical to sage.

> Typically we might want to use it for most basic rings.

Indeed. For now, I'm just testing this for padics but it works well.

Some thoughts:

Thanks :-)

> * We should probably wait a bit to see if anyone responds on the Cython list.  If they are going to implement such a pool, great; otherwise I definitely think this is a feature worth having in Sage.

Sure.
But as I mentioned above, my implementation is based on the parent (which is typical to Sage).

> * As you pointed out on Zulip, `self.prime_pow` isn't set during `__cinit__`.  Since it's not used in any of the current linkage files, I think it's fine removing it from the call.  If we implement a linkage where it's needed, we can rethink the process with that example in mind.

If `self.prime_pow` is needed in this initialization, I think that we should seriously consider the option to have a pool for each parent.

I actually think that this could be an option in any case. Concretely `pool_enable` could take an attribute `global`; if it set to true, then the pool is shared with all other parents using the same type; otherwise, it is local to the parent. And the default could be `True`.

> * I like your mechanism for allowing the enabling and disabling of pools at the level of individual parents.  Presumably we'll eventually have heuristics for when pools should be enabled (depending on `p` and `prec_cap`).

Yes.

> * I'm not completely sure about the reference counting code you've used (though I don't have any particular flaws in mind). We should make sure to test for memory leaks somehow.

Reference counting should be fine (hopefully).
The line `o.ob_refcnt = 1` in the de-allocation prevents the object to be collected again and again.
The line `o.ob_refcnt = 0` in the allocation is needed because the reference counting is incremented just after.

> * At what level should we add a Pool?  I'm hesitant to add it to Parent (because there is a memory cost), but there isn't another obvious place. Perhaps we should raise this on sage-devel once the code on this ticket has progressed a bit?

One possible solution: we create a new class `ParentWithPool` (inheriting from `Parent`) and let the parents that wants to implement a pool derive from this class. This won't affect other parents (and then will limit the number of bugs).

Oh, I've always thought that overriding `__dealloc__` doesn't prevent the actual deallocation of memory but just allows the user to free properly extra allocated memory (just like a C destructor). Am I mistaken?

I'm not convinced that it should. Ideally, the implementation should be as generic as possible, so the parent should not be involved.

The benefit of having the parent involved is that you can turn on the pool for `p=5` when it's useful, and off for `p=next_prime(10^400)` when it's not.

If we can make pools available upstream in Cython, I think it's worth giving up this feature.  But if we're just implementing it in Sage, I like Xavier's choice to attach it to the parent, since I don't see anything in Sage other than elements using a pool, and we do get the flexibility of varying the behavior by parent.

In case it is not clear, let me mention that I disagree with several design choices made here (storing the pool in the parent is one of them).

I think that the `Integer` pool is a much better idea and I suggest to expand on that instead of reinventing a new (worse) pool implementation.

Don't worry, I think I understood that you disagree :-).

I wanted to be sure that my approach will eventually work and it's the reason why I continued working on it (and then pushed it to the ticket).
I'm however happy to discuss design choices.

But, I'm afraid that I didn't understand well your point. 
Could you explain for instance more why you don't like storing the pool in the parent? Is it "just" because it's not enough cythonic? Is there something more?

Could you detail more please what should be the features of a good pool (according to you)? I understand, I think, that it should be attached to a python type, it that right? Are you proposing to modify Cython and embed it in the `PyTypeObject` structure?

That's actually an excellent question. In decreasing order of importance, a pool should:

1. Be robust (all code which currently works with the type should continue to work the same way if the type is implemented with a pool).

2. Be fast.

3. Be as generic as possible, i.e. work for any type.

4. Not require any special code to use the pool (i.e. no `PY_NEW` or `PY_NEW_WITH_POOL`).

5. Make it easy for developers to add a pool to their types.

> Besides, do you think that the pool should be resizable or not? Should we let to the user the possibility to enable/disable it? More generally, should the pool be accessible through special methods/commands?

First of all, these are details: we should first get a good design and then think about this.

To answer the question: I don't think that such features would ever be used. So, you could add them, but why? Perhaps more interesting would be to get access to some statictics, like how full is the pool, how often does it overflow/underflow...

I didn't say this ticket was ready for positive review yet.  But what makes these implementations "semi-working?"  The integer one has been in Sage for a long time and seems to be useful.

As for having two implementations, I'd be curious to see how the speed of the current integer pool compares with Xavier's implementation.  If nothing else, it would give us an idea of how costly performance-wise the decision to use the parent to store the pool is.
