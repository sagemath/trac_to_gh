No changes to the Sage build system or Sage library are needed, so there is full build compatibility with the stable version.

There are some doctest failures though, which need to be fixed.

It just does. Sage doesn't have a concept of lower/higher version numbers, only of *changed* version numbers.

> Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/)


I wonder how they do that. I am doing as documented to create a PARI tarball (`make distrib`) and the version number `pari-2.9.0-1234-gd1d0c49` is what comes out of the **official upstream script**.

So I would argue that the bug is upstream then.
