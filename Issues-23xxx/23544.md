It just does. Sage doesn't have a concept of lower/higher version numbers, only of *changed* version numbers.

> Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/)


I wonder how they do that. I am doing as documented to create a PARI tarball (`make distrib`) and the version number `pari-2.9.0-1234-gd1d0c49` is what comes out of the **official upstream script**.

So I would argue that the bug is upstream then.
