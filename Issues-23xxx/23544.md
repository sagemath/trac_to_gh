OK, can you explain to me how sage will know to upgrade from 2.9.3 to 2.9.0-xxxxxx? Am I missing something there about the build system.

Even if the version number doesn't matter so much, because sage builds and rebuilds stuff on version change, whatever they are, my sanity says the version number should be higher. Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/) and of course all the pari-2.9 releases have the same soname but this one will have different one.

Please change the version name.

It just does. Sage doesn't have a concept of lower/higher version numbers, only of *changed* version numbers.

> Even upstream pari name their snapshot pari-2.10 [https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/pub/pari/snapshots/)

I wonder how they do that. I am doing as documented to create a PARI tarball (`make distrib`) and the version number `pari-2.9.0-1234-gd1d0c49` is what comes out of the **official upstream script**.

So I would argue that the bug is upstream then.
