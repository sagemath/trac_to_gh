<a id='comment:5'></a>This ticket and #23693 have the same branch and contains both the changes for affine_homset and projective_homset. What did you mean to do with these two tickets?

Otherwise, just a few minor things:

- CDF should work in addition to CC

- a couple of the comments in the affine_homset reference projective. Fix those.

- the sorting line is commented out in affine_homset and should be restored

- You need to update the docmentation of .rational_points() to describe the changes and add an example there.

<a id='comment:12'></a>Just a couple simple comments before I test functionality.

Instead of importing, its better to use members function whenever possible (i.e., .floor())

The two for loops

```
for i in range(len(dupl_points)):
    for j in range(len(dupl_points)):
        if j > i:
            u = dupl_points[i]
```
can be simplified to

```
for i in range(len(dupl_points)):
    u = dupl_points[i]
    for j in range(i+1, len(dupl_points)):
```

<a id='comment:13'></a>Actually after product with tolerance, the result becomes float, and hence floor(), member function doesn't exist. So there are 2 options

1) Convert tolerance to RealNumber and then use .floor()

2) use floor from math

currently I implemented using 2), should I change to 1)? or do you have any other idea?

Thanks

For simple subschemes, it was ok, but for even mildly complicated schemes (such as projective closures of intersections of affine curves) you could easily get wildly wrong answers. So, I think the verbose warning is warranted in this case.

This also led me to separate out the case where the subscheme is defined over a number field and the user wants points numerically approximated which is much faster. This seems to work well in my testing (up to precision/tolerance).

Additionally, the documenation was significantly updated as well as normalizing all the inputs for the various points/rational_points methods.

So I'm marking this as needs-review, but it should undergo fairly extensive testing as I'm sure there are cases I missed.

<a id='comment:21'></a>## There are couple of documentation updated 
- Value of dimension need to be corrected (line no := for projective_homset 74, 188, 383, 453; for affine_homset 129, 138).

- Calculation of dimension in projective homset is wrong (needs to be one less than I.dimension(), line no :- 185, 380).

- Subscheme should be replaced by scheme (line no: for projective homset 75, 293; for affine homset 129, 317).

- Projective word should be replaced by affine in affine homset (line no := 283, 436).

- Example in docstring of projective_homset for CC, and CDF are similar. different example need to be added.

- For `NumberFields` embeddings should be specified during formation, this needs to be added in documentation.

- In affine homset example below is better to illustrate working in CDF, compared to current example

```
sage: A.<x1, x2> = AffineSpace(CDF, 2)
sage: E = A.subscheme([x1^2 + x2^2 + x1*x2 + 1, x1 + x2])
sage: E(A.base_ring()).points() 
verbose 0 (124: affine_homset.py, points) Warning: computations in the
numerical fields are inexact;points may be computed partially or
incorrectly.
[(-2.77555756156e-17 + 1.0*I, 2.77555756156e-17 - 1.0*I), (-1.0*I,
1.0*I)]
```
- There should be an example in projective and affine homset to illustrate use of tolerance, some thing like this

```
sage: A.<x1, x2> = AffineSpace(QQ, 2)
sage: E = A.subscheme([x1^1000 + x2^2 + x1*x2 + 1, x1 + x2])
sage: len(E(A.base_ring()).numerical_points(F=CDF, zero_tolerance =1e-11))
987
sage: len(E(A.base_ring()).numerical_points(F=CDF, zero_tolerance =1e-10))
1000
```
**Following gives wrong result**

```
sage: P.<x1, x2> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
sage: E = A.subscheme([x1^2 -3*x1 + 2, x2])
sage: E(A.base_ring()).numerical_points(F=CDF, zero_tolerance =1e-10)
[(1.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0)]
sage: E(A.base_ring()).points()
[(1, 0), (2, 0)]
```
They are same projective point, and hence only 1 should be returned.

**This also**

```
sage: P.<x1> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 0)
sage: E = A.subscheme([x1^2 -3*x1 + 2])
sage: E(A.base_ring()).points(bound=5)
[(1, -5), (1, -4), (1, -3), (1, -2), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2),
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, -5), (2, -4), (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2,
0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]
```
