The characteristic should be the characteristic of the `K` from this documentation:

```
r"""
Symbolic Coordinate Functions

In the context of a topological manifold `M` over a topological field `K`,
a *coordinate function*  is a function from a chart codomain
to `K`. In other words, a coordinate function is a `K`-valued function of
the coordinates associated to some chart.
```

Now please tell me: how does one retrieve the `K` from the coordinate ring?

On the other hand, the focus on symbolics might imply that the characteristic is always zero, but it would be good if somebody could confirm this.
