Decompose a Dyck word into a sequence of ascents and prime Dyck paths.

The result is a sequence of odd length, the words with even indices consist of up steps only and the words with odd indices are complete Dyck paths without touch points.  The concatenation of the result is the original word.

I would guess that

```
sage: DyckWord([1,0,1,0]).prime_decomposition()
[[1, 0], [1, 0]]
```
and all of the factors would be prime. So the name is a little misleading to me. So instead I propose renaming the method `prime_ascent_decomposition()`. I also do not see a good way to modify the definition of prime to get that this decomposition is unique. In a way, the ascent paths are prime (they never return to the diagonal), but then the sequence is not unique, which could be remedied by adding something like "maximal ascents".

Thank you for looking at this!

I admit that I have no good name.  The closest thing is the related notion of "Catalan factorization", from R. Cori and L. Chottin, Une preuve combinatoire de la rationalité d’une série génératrice associée aux arbres, RAIRO Inform. Théor. 16, no. 2 (1982) 113–128, which does something similar for arbitrary words.

On the other hand, this map occurs frequently...

`ascent_prime_decomposition` is OK for me (ascents come first, so I guess it's a good hint).

I updated the description to meet your (very good) comments!

Thanks. Two more little things:

```diff
-        A Dyck path is prime if it has precisely one return - the
-        final step. In particular, the empty Dyck path is not prime.
-        Thus, the factorization is unique.
+        A Dyck word is *prime* if it is complete and has precisely one
+        return - the final step. In particular, the empty Dyck word is
+        not prime. Thus, the factorization is unique.
```
and either (my [strong] preference, but there is no clear majority here)

```
        Decompose ``self`` into a sequence of ascents and prime
        Dyck words.
```
or

```
        Decompose this Dyck word into a sequence of ascents and
        prime Dyck words.
```
Once done, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

Dear Travis,

I just added the Catalan decomposition, too.  I don't need it right now, but having it might reduce confusion...

I hope you don't mind.
