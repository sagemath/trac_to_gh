The first error occurs during

`make Theora.pdf` which is defined in `$THEORA_SOURCE/doc/spec/Makefile`. 
Changing the two occurences of `\begin{figure}[Htbp]` to `\begin{figure}[htbp]` in `doc/spec/spec.tex` solves this issue but now it is stuc at a more serious problem:

```

this seems to be because `png_sizeof` was removed from `lib_png` version 1.6.0, see [1] and we ship lib_png 1.6.29.

I have looked a bit into this, and I could not find a place where this package actually enhances the sage library so this would just be a package that is easy to install in sage the distribution. However I don't really see what the reason is to have this package in "sage the distribution" without some easy user accecible way to generate fancy movies out of sage output.

Does either of you agree with this? If so I will ask on sage-devel if people agree with this.
