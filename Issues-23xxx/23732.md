The first error occurs during

`make Theora.pdf` which is defined in `$THEORA_SOURCE/doc/spec/Makefile`. 
Changing the two occurences of `\begin{figure}[Htbp]` to `\begin{figure}[htbp]` in `doc/spec/spec.tex` solves this issue but now it is stuc at a more serious problem:

```

this seems to be because `png_sizeof` was removed from `lib_png` version 1.6.0, see [1] and we ship lib_png 1.6.29.
