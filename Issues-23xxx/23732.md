The first error occurs during

`make Theora.pdf` which is defined in `$THEORA_SOURCE/doc/spec/Makefile`. 
Changing the two occurences of `\begin{figure}[Htbp]` to `\begin{figure}[htbp]` in `doc/spec/spec.tex` solves this issue but now it is stuc at a more serious problem:

```

```

this seems to be because `png_sizeof` was removed from `lib_png` version 1.6.0, see [1] and we ship lib_png 1.6.29.

An optional package failing to *build* should in general not be a blocker, unless maybe if it is a recent regression. I only said that optional packages causing *doctest failures* (or more general breakage) should be blockers.

I have looked a bit into this, and I could not find a place where this package actually enhances the sage library so this would just be a package that is easy to install in sage the distribution.

Does either of you agree with this? If so I will ask on sage-devel if people agree with this.
