Currently, operations involving Sage and gmpy2 numbers are broken (see [comment:7]). Though, it works fine with gmpy2 and Python numbers. The reason is that the various binary operations implemented in gmpy2 just check for Python integer types. It should be possible to modify these functions in order that an operation involving a gmpy2 number and a type implementing one of the `__mpz__`/`__mpq__`/`__mpfr__`/`__mpc__` method should work.

Note: #22928 implemented the conversion Sage type -> gmpy2 type via the implementation of the `__mpz__`, `__mpq__`, `__mpfr__` and `__mpc__` methods.

This makes no sense to me. What does it mean to provide coercion for **certain operations** only?

This is obviously the right thing to do. Given that

```
sage: from gmpy2 import mpz
sage: mpz(1) + int(1)
mpz(2)
```
works, it's actually strange that

```
sage: from gmpy2 import mpz
sage: mpz(1) + Integer(1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: '<type 'mpz'>' and 'Integer Ring'
```
doesn't work.

This is a great news. Thanks for the work!

Do we have a schedule for the next gmpy2 release? Since gmpy2 becomes a standard package for the next Sage release it would be nice if it would happen before.

Otherwise, I am not a big fan of using patches that are integrated upstream but not released yet.
