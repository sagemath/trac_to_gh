The `normaliz` package uses OMP for threading, which can create many threads. In doctests, this is bad for two reasons:

1. Doctests should not use an unexpectedly large number of system resources.

2. When there are too many threads, the virtual memory limit from #23748 will be hit.

There is a solution: set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting.

+1. Doctests should not use an unexpectedly large number of system resources.
 
-The cause seems to be the same as #23879: `pynormaliz` requires a very large amount of memory (more than what #23748 allows).
+2. When there are too many threads, the virtual memory limit from #23748 will be hit.
+
+There is a solution: set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting.

Yes, it is the smallest integer strictly larger than 1.

1 thread is too few, because it doesn't really test threading. With 2 threads, you do test threading. On the other hand, the system load will at most be a factor 200% too large, which is not too bad.

Alternatively, you can set `os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS']` in a doctest too. That's easy to do and would fix the testing problem.
