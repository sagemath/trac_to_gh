```
The `normaliz` package uses OMP for threading, which can create many threads. In doctests, this is bad for two reasons:

1. Doctests should not use an unexpectedly large number of system resources.

2. When there are too many threads, the virtual memory limit from #23748 will be hit.

There is a solution: set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting.

+1. Doctests should not use an unexpectedly large number of system resources.
 
-The cause seems to be the same as #23879: `pynormaliz` requires a very large amount of memory (more than what #23748 allows).
+2. When there are too many threads, the virtual memory limit from #23748 will be hit.
+
+There is a solution: set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting.

In particular, many tests in `src/sage/combinat/rigged_configurations` fail for me with `pynormaliz`.

Since the problem depends on the number of threads, which is the number of cores by default, it could very well be that this problem only occurs on systems with many cores. The system where I saw the failure has 24 cores. Maybe you could get the failure with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=24`?

Yes, it is the smallest integer strictly larger than 1.

1 thread is too few, because it doesn't really test threading. With 2 threads, you do test threading. On the other hand, the system load will at most be a factor 200% too large, which is not too bad.
