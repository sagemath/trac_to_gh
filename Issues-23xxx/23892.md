```
The `normaliz` package uses OMP for threading, which can create many threads. In doctests, this is bad for two reasons:

1. Doctests should not use an unexpectedly large number of system resources.

2. When there are too many threads, the virtual memory limit from #23748 will be hit.

There is a solution: set the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting.

Since the problem depends on the number of threads, which is the number of cores by default, it could very well be that this problem only occurs on systems with many cores. The system where I saw the failure has 24 cores. Maybe you could get the failure with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=24`?

Yes, it is the smallest integer strictly larger than 1.

1 thread is too few, because it doesn't really test threading. With 2 threads, you do test threading. On the other hand, the system load will at most be a factor 200% too large, which is not too bad.

One thing that I don't like about the current patch is that it overwrites `OMP_NUM_THREADS` even if it is already explicitly set before running sage tests.

I consider that a feature. The point is that doctests should be reproducible and not depend too much on the external environment. If somebody has set an environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, the most likely reason is that he wants to use that number of threads for actual computations. It does not mean that he wants to use that many threads for doctests too.

Alternatively, you can set `os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS']` in a doctest too. That's easy to do and would fix the testing problem.

Are you sure you mean #23612? It seems unrelated to `PYTHONPATH` or doctests.
