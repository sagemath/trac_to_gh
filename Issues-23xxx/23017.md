Some details of the Sage docstring styles are not clearly stated in the developer manual, and left to each writer's discretion. This introduced inconsistencies and sometimes allowed bad styles. The purpose of this ticket is to spot those details and provide specific guidelines for them, based on the consensus of the developer community.

The guidelines collected here will be used to revise 

http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings

---

H1. Write 

```
``True``, ``False``, ``None``
```
but do not write 

```
True, False, None
```

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/EVG7wQExYOQ

---

H2. It is preferable to write

```
if the lattice is reflexive
```
than

```
if ``self`` is reflexive
```

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/dm8PQbni0Y8

---

H3. Write

```
Return whether this lattice is reflexive.
```
but do not write

```
Return ``True`` if the lattice is reflexive and ``False`` otherwise.
```

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/OFuYydUMMzI

---

H4. OUTPUT block is optional but recommended unless it is clear from the one-line 
explanation.

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/i9pemQvEE5E

---

H5. Write

```
OUTPUT: a tuple of lattices
```

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/bdLBvSlJLPo

---
H6. Write

```
INPUT: 

- ``n`` -- integer (default: 1); the number of repetition
```

This was discussed at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/eMkeLj_w9ZY

<a id='comment:4'></a>I would like to add that `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks should be sufficiently verbose.

Some places in Sage have something like

```
INPUT:

- ``x`` -- integer
```

Well, that's not very useful. If should explain the purpose of `x`, not just the fact that it's an integer.

<a id='comment:7'></a>Strong -1 to G1. `True` and similar should be code because they are Python objects.

Strong -1 to G2. `self` is a well-defined concept in Python, more concise, and more clear when subclasses are involved.

Subsequently, I see no good options in G3. However, option 3 is closet, and I prefer:

```
Return whether ``self`` is reflexive.
```

G4: recommended but optional. This is what we primarily do in practice anyways.

+1 on comment:5, although I do a slightly different style

```

<a id='comment:9'></a>have you considered here the guidelines for writing an exception string? 

no beginning upper case, no final full stop is what i've been told, but i just quickly checked [documentation strings chapter](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings) and there are seemingly no guidelines. 

only: ``“It is an error to [..]”``

thanks

No. This ticket is about docstrings. 

If you have specific ideas, you may start your own ticket and polls about exception strings. But do you really have specific ideas to guide  developers on exception strings other than "no beginning upper case, no final full stop"?  Hmm, I don't have...

The bulleted point starting with "Lines should be shorter than 80 characters." has a line which is exactly 80 characters, so perhaps that should be broken up so all lines are shorter than 80 characters. Some of the other lines (for example in the paragraph starting "The decomposition of the free module ..." are now longer than 80 characters.

Why did you delete "If it contains multiple lines, all the lines after the first need to begin at the same indentation as the backtick"? I think that is helpful information, and people often make mistakes with this indentation in docstrings.

I broke up many lines to make it shorten than 80 characters. But I kept some of the lines as they look better as they are than broken up.
