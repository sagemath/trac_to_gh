I have corrected some rather strange-sounding sentences.

And I also put back "whether", which is used in the rest of the file.

If you agree, you can set to positive.

OK.

There was a discussion about this in the sage-devel list, but I think I didn't read all of it. Currently the developer manual has an example "Return whether this integer is prime." Was that what we agreed? If so, I can later mass-change `is_*`-functions to use that.
