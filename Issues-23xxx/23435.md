This ticket creates dynamic classes with `__slots__ = []` if all base classes of the dynamic class are extension types. This causes the dynamic class to behave like an extension type. In fact, `is_extension_type()` will return `True` for such a dynamic class.

The goal is to reduce the performance penalty when replacing an extension type by a dynamic class: extension types and Python classes with `__slots__` have no `__dict__` which speeds up all attribute accesses and which reduces memory usage.

I doubt anyone is using the features provided from having a `__dict__`. So I think the better solution would be to change the tutorial because the `CFM.element_class` is really just a workaround not inheriting properly from the category implementation. Because once we remove that workaround, we would run into the same problem.

Also, IMO this test is not accurate (or at least somewhat misleading):

```
Some particular actions modify the data structure of ``el``::

    sage: el.rename("bla")
    sage: el
    bla
```
For the tests that are failing in the `.. NOTE::`, we can just change it to, e.g., `E.<x,y> = algebras.Exterior(QQ)` that has a proper Python subclass.

Does this sound okay?
