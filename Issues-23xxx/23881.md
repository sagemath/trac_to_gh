In order to avoid confusion between `_element_constructor_` (a public interface) and `_element_constructor` (a private attribute), we change the latter from `cdef public` to `cdef`. The same for `_element_init_pass_parent`. This way, those attributes can no longer be accessed from Python.

I am not sure whether `_element_constructor` is needed at all. Since `_element_constructor_` has underscores, it is private to a certain extent, but still public enough to be a hook for customisation. That's why I believe a default implementation (which is allowed to override) of `_element_constructor_` should be a replacement of the current `_element_constructor`.

Here we could probably use the default implementation of `zero()`.

An internal attribute such as `_element_constructor` shouldn't be mentioned in the docs.

I see: It is not *a* tuple, but it is *the class* <tuple>.

That's probably a tricky case: The elements are tuples, so, the elements are not instances of `sage.structure.element.Element`, and in particular it is one of the cases where we do not want to pass the parent. It should be possible to customize `_element_constructor_` in that case, but there would be a slow-down, compared with calling the tuple constructor directly (without the additional step of a method that calls the tuple constructor).

I just checked, it's just a speedup of a factor 4 - I guess there is no performance testing in sage:

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit len([x for x in S.__iter__()])
1 loop, best of 3: 322 ms per loop
sage: %timeit len([x for x in S.__iter_new__()])
10 loops, best of 3: 85.7 ms per loop

sage: A = [x for x in S.__iter_new__()]
sage: B = [x for x in S.__iter__()]
sage: A == B
True
```

Of course, the documentation should explain how to implement `_element_constructor_`. However, the documentation must not suggest that the method (with or without trailing underscore) should ever be called directly.

Briefly looking at your commit: I find it a good idea that you are using a `cdef __construct_element` instead of a `cdef public _element_constructor`, because in that way it is certain that no Python class will illegally use the internal element constructor. I also see that you make pickling backward compatible.

My commit fixes one part of the documentation (in sage.schemes).

So far, the git commits come from Maarten and me, so, I guess the Authors field should be changed accordingly.

On a different ticket, Jeroen said that he likes small tickets. I guess that means I should open a new ticket for cleanup of the documentation.

I suggest, in order to not change things in git that have already been done, to let commit:c95b724 (Remove ._element_constructor_ from sage.schemes documentation) stay here and open a new ticket for other documentation issues.

First of all, the failures resulting from Maarten's commit should be addressed.

I don't really get this. The padic failures need to be fixed anyway, either here or on #23884. Why don't you like to do it on a different ticket?

Interestingly, you are the first person I am hearing this from.

Advantages of small tickets:

1. Small tickets are easier to review because the reviewer only needs to look at a small set of changes.

2. Different tickets can have different sets of authors/reviewers, each with their own interests/specialities.

3. Small tickets are less likely to get stuck because of one isolated difficulty. For example: a ticket like "stop using `_element_constructor`" cannot succeed as long as there is one isolated place where `_element_constructor` is used non-trivially. A ticket like "stop using `_element_constructor` in sub-package foo" does not have this problem.

Usually, when working on a big ticket like #23880 (big in the sense that it has a lot of connections to other parts of Sage, it is very non-local), I start coding and then split off separate tickets as I go along.

Seriously??? When I was younger, I occasionally did direct tests (say, for `__iter__`) and was told to not do that.

I also think it has been discussed on sage-devel a long time ago and the consensus was that the documentation (in particular the "EXAMPLES:" section) has to show how stuff is actually being used. It may be possible to be a bit more explicit in the "TESTS:" section, but still I'd recommend against it.

It is clear from the tutorials that `_repr_`, `_add_`, `_mul_` and `_element_constructor_` (all *single* underscore!) in Sage implement string representation of parents/elements, addition resp. multiplication of elements, and the call method of parents. Thus, all these methods should be tested indirectly:

```
sage: P    # indirect doctest
String representation
sage: x+y  # indirect doctest
result of addition
sage: P(x) # indirect doctest
result of conversion

Do you mean [comment:33](#comment%3A33) or [comment:36](#comment%3A36)?

I usually am just lazy and do indirect for `_element_constructor_` tests. However, I probably should do direct calls in tests... However, for some of the methods, it is just easier (and can be more readable, such as for algebraic operations) to do the indirect test.

It is the other way around; the `_element_constructor_` is called from `Parent.__call__`. It usually is the last thing called from the parent and actually constructs the element when doing `Foo(bar)`.

With all the dependencies on this ticket and #23880, I am no longer convinced that we need this ticket. We could also simply do the change `cdef public _element_constructor` -> `cdef _element_constructor` here and nothing else.

I think removing `_element_constructor` from the public Python API is a good thing to do to prevent anyone else from adding something (although I would say that is highly unlikely).

I don't see see why either so I agree it is highly unlikely, but since `parent` is modified it is not impossible. It does not need to be machine dependent, it can also be a bug that happens 50% of the time that is exposed after this.

There are two machines failing on this ticket and I have not seen it on either arando or rk02-math in at least 10 other failing logs that I checked. So from this point of view it is also very unlikely that it is not from this ticket. Of course this ticket could have been very unlucky to expose a rare random bug twice for the first time but this is also highly unlikely.

I just would like to see arguments for why we are in one unlikely scenario and not the other.

Note that this ticket also has a lot of dependencies merged so it could also be exposed by one of the dependencies, which might explain why I didn't see it on any of the arando and rk02-math logsI checked.

If only we could search through the patchbot log easily, then we could get conclusive answers much faster.
