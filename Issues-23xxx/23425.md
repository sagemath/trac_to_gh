This is the second ticket for my Google Summer of Code project (the first was #23257: Plotting the Mandelbrot set). I have added the `external_ray` function to the `Complex Dynamics` folder. This function allows the user to pass in an angle or list of angles and returns the plot of the external rays for the given angles on the Mandelbrot set.

Depends on #23257

I haven't had a chance to do much testing yet. So far it appears to work well in the notebook, but I need to do a thorough code review. Here is at least one error:

```
sage: external_ray(3/7,D=70)
ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer
```
if you zoom in, it looks like something is going wrong with the later Newton's methods

```
sage: external_ray(3/7,D=60, image_width=0.1, x_center=-1.75)
```

here are a few minor things I picked out:

- need to input check 0<=  ray <=1

- need to wrap the long lines (90 characters is the typical limit)

- add a ray color example

- change the first long example to a decimal

- in warning:
  - typo 'specify the which'

- you shouldn't need to keywords for the mandelbrot set here.

It would be cleaner to default image to None. Then after you .pop image you check if 'is None' and if true mandelbrot_plot. If you use .get() instead of .pop() you can pass kwds directly to mandelbrot_plot.

- you can just say, theta = list(theta) instead of 

```
    if type(theta) != list:
        theta = [theta]
```

- put something in the doc about: if the ray doesn't reach the boundary increase D, if the ray looks jagged increase S. Has a speed penalty
