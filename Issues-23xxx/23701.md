```
-CONFIGURE_FLAGS="--enable-large-config"
-if [ "$UNAME" = "CYGWIN" ]; then
-    # See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22694
-    CONFIGURE_FLAGS="$CONFIGURE_FLAGS --enable-threads=posix --enable-handle-fork"
-fi
-
 ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" $CONFIGURE_FLAGS
```

Now `$CONFIGURE_FLAGS` is undefined and not used so you could remove that too.

Also, I have another change I need to propose but I'm still investigating a bit...

I have some slight changes to this

1) To get it compatible with #23701 on Cygwin

2) To update it to use `sage-dist-helpers` à la #24025

Do you mind if I replace this with my branch?  If it works then positive review from me (with apologies for the long delay)

Instead of `CONFIGURE_FLAGS`, most packages use a variable name of the form `{PACKAGENAME}_CONFIGURE`. So I suggest to use `LIBATOMIC_OPS_CONFIGURE` for this.
