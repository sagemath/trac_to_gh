-    # See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22694

-fi
-
 ./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" $CONFIGURE_FLAGS
```

Now `$CONFIGURE_FLAGS` is undefined and not used so you could remove that too.

Also, I have another change I need to propose but I'm still investigating a bit...

I have some slight changes to this

1) To get it compatible with #23701 on Cygwin

2) To update it to use `sage-dist-helpers` à la #24025
