```
The function treewidth() with the option certificate=True encounters two problems on non-connected graphs.

Firstly, if I run

```div
  {{{#!python
  g=Graph({0:[1,2], 3:[4,5], 4:[5]})
  g.treewidth(certificate=True)
  }}}
```
I obtain 

![](http://lacim.uqam.ca/~elise.vandomme/treewidth.png) 

which contradicts the fact that the tree-width of the graph is 2.

The problem comes from the part ".edges(labels=False)" in

```div
  {{{#!python
       # Disconnected cases
        if not g.is_connected():
            if certificate is False:
                if k is None:
                    return max(cc.treewidth() for cc in g.connected_components_subgraphs())
                else:
                    return all(cc.treewidth(k) for cc in g.connected_components_subgraphs())
            else:
                return Graph(sum([cc.treewidth(certificate=True).edges(labels=False)
                                  for cc in g.connected_components_subgraphs()],[]),
                             name="Tree decomposition")
  }}}
```
Indeed, one of the connected components has a tree decomposition that consists of a single vertex. So its list of edges is an empty list and we lose information when we just consider the concatenation of edges list.

Secondly, a tree decomposition is a tree by definition. But when I run 

```div
  {{{#!python
  g=Graph({0:[1,2], 3:[4,5]})
  g.treewidth(certificate=True)
  }}}
```
the result is two non-connected edges. This minor problem can be corrected by adding an arbitrary edge between the i-th and i+1-th connected components of the result (for all possible i).

Keywords: **tree decomposition, tree-width**

The patch is working well. However, a few minor changes are needed.

-  <code>:trac:\`23546\`::</code>  -> <code>The decomposition is a tree (:trac:\`23546\`)::</code>. This will improve the documentation. 

- You must add an empty line after between the line with <code>:trac:\`23546\`</code> and the line `sage: g = Graph({0:[1,2], 3:[4,5]})`.

- `sage: vertices = set({})` -> `sage: vertices = {}`. 

- `v = T[0].vertices()[0]` -> `v = next(T[0].vertex_iterator())`. There is no need for first building the list of vertices. We can use the iterator to get the first vertex.

- `tree.add_edge([t.vertices()[0],v])` -> `tree.add_edge(t.vertices()[0], v)`. Here also, there is no need for creating a list.

Thank you.

I have implemented all the suggestion except this one:

sage: vertices = set({}) -> sage: vertices = {}

since the object {} is a dictionary and I want to have an empty set.
