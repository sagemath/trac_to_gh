In #20191 the `cases` function is introduced. This ticket should interface it with SymPy's piecewise (both directions) and test with:

```
        sage: _ = var('y, z')
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y)
        -y*z + x^y/log(x)
        sage: (x^y - z).integrate(y, algorithm="sympy")  # see Trac #14694
        -y*z + cases(((log(x) == 0, y), (1, x^y/log(x))))
```

Notes : 
* I rebased the test on the hust-issued 8.1.beta8
* I have kept #24026 (which `needs_review`, BTW...) because removing it entails recompiling R (which is slow) and reinstall 442 R packages, (which is slower...).
