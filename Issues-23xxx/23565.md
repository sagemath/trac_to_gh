Not merged, but the doctests we are worrying about haven't been touched. You can just see them at the top of the commit. The ticket is relevant though. Maxima agrees with the new value (`pi^2 / 6`). And actually other test in the same file give that answer:\n\n```\nclass Function_polylog(GinacFunction):\n    def __init__(self):\n        r\"\"\"\n        The polylog function\n        `\\text{Li}_s(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} z^k / k^s`.\n\n        This definition is valid for arbitrary complex order `s` and for\n        all complex arguments `z` with `|z| < 1`; it can be extended to\n        `|z| \\ge 1` by the process of analytic continuation. So the\n        function may have a discontinuity at `z=1` which can cause a\n        `NaN` value returned for floating point arguments.\n\n        EXAMPLES::\n\n            sage: polylog(2.7, 0)\n            0\n            sage: polylog(2, 1)\n            1/6*pi^2\n```\nAnd where we are now is:\n\n```\n        Check if :trac:`18386` is fixed::\n\n            sage: polylog(2.0, 1)\n            1.64493406684823\n            sage: polylog(2, 1.0)\n            NaN\n            sage: polylog(2.0, 1.0)\n            NaN\n```\n\nI am tempted to say this upgrade is now fixing it. Although why upgrading arb fix a pynac behavior is a bit of mystery to me since pynac doesn't link to arb.",

        r"""
        The polylog function
        `\text{Li}_s(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} z^k / k^s`.

        This definition is valid for arbitrary complex order `s` and for
        all complex arguments `z` with `|z| < 1`; it can be extended to
        `|z| \ge 1` by the process of analytic continuation. So the
        function may have a discontinuity at `z=1` which can cause a
        `NaN` value returned for floating point arguments.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: polylog(2.7, 0)
            0
            sage: polylog(2, 1)
            1/6*pi^2
```
And where we are now is:

```
        Check if :trac:`18386` is fixed::

            sage: polylog(2.0, 1)
            1.64493406684823
            sage: polylog(2, 1.0)
            NaN
            sage: polylog(2.0, 1.0)
            NaN
```

I am tempted to say this upgrade is now fixing it. Although why upgrading arb fix a pynac behavior is a bit of mystery to me since pynac doesn't link to arb.

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A16):
> Is this making #18386 a duplicate? Otherwise I think we have everything for a positive review.

Yes it does. Note that
I have merged the branch of #18386 here (see ​f854f36) and adjusted wrong (for arb 2.11.1) test outputs in 51aeae3.

As arb update alleviates some of the issues on #18386 I thought it's more logical this way.
