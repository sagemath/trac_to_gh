With the optional package `cbc` installed (and no other optional package):

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long src/sage/combinat/designs/orthogonal_arrays_build_recursive.py  # Killed due to segmentation fault
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/digraph.py  # Bad exit: 127
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/generic_graph.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/graph_coloring.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/graph.py  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long src/sage/libs/gap/assigned_names.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long src/sage/numerical/backends/gurobi_backend.pyx  # Killed due to abort
sage -t --long src/sage/graphs/graph_decompositions/vertex_separation.pyx  # Timed out
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Since the failures refer to memory allocation errors, this is because `cbc` requires a very large amount of memory (more than what #23748 allows).

One simple fix is to never use the `cbc` solver by default.
