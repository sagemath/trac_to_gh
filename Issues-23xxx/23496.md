I think that you should create a dependency on this ticket in your (#20204).
This ticket was created to separate the sympy patch from the modifications done in Sage.
This ticket is yet a dependency of #22802

After a week of debugging I think that this is the unique to pass the tests in french_book.recequadiff :
in test : 
383   sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
the integer 3/2  (Sage Integer) makes necessary the modifications (you suggested) to composition function:
u(n+2) is sympy
(3/2)*u(n+1) is sage 
...
...



the error in
388 sage: rsolve(f, u(n), {u(0):-1,u(1):1})
is caused by the fact that Sympy integer are not imported.

Before the sympy patch there was not error but for me it was not correct:
because the expressions mixed sympy (u,n) and sage quantities (1/2).

what i find odd is that:

- using `n = Symbol('n')` in the `rsolve` test it works,
- similarly but using `from sympy.abc import n`.

to move on, i propose to modify the test as below, and report the failing use case in a new ticket.

```
sage: n = var('n', domain='integer'); u = function('u')
sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
sage: us = u._sympy_() ; fs = f._sympy_();
sage: from sympy import rsolve; rsolve(fs, us(n), {us(0):-1,us(1):1})
3 - 4*2**(-n)
```

what do you think?

> We need to do another ticket?

IMHO yes, because this is a different issue; the new ticket could be about implementing `rsolve` in Sage, as an interface to sympy's `rsolve`. 

The doctest discussed here is used as an example on page 17 of this document:
https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/recequadiff.pdf ,
which is a chapter of the English translation of the so-called "French book" (*Calcul mathématique avec Sage*). The latter is currently in its final preparatory stage, cf. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/MalKzTyvrys .
One should probably ask the authors to update this example (the book is not likely to be out before Sage 8.1, where the current ticket could be effective).

I think this is the real problem with all of this:

```
sage: from sympy import Symbol
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(1+n).args[1] == n
False
```
The roundtrip of a sympy symbol through Sage results in a different symbol:

```
sage: m = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: m == n
True
sage: p = Symbol('n')
sage: p == n
False

sage: sympy.simplify(SR(n)).assumptions0
{'commutative': True}
sage: n.assumptions0
{'algebraic': True,
 'commutative': True,
 'complex': True,
 'hermitian': True,
 'imaginary': False,
 'integer': True,
 'irrational': False,
 'noninteger': False,
 'rational': True,
 'real': True,
 'transcendental': False}
sage: p is sympy.sympify(SR(n))
True
```
So I think we need to translate assumptions over to truly fix the problem.

hi, thank you all for the help debugging. with this sympy patch (at sympy/core/function.py and on top of #20204), it works for me:

```
class AppliedUndef(Function):
    """
    Base class for expressions resulting from the application of an undefined
    function.
    """
    .
    .
    .
    def _sage_(self):
        import sage.all as sage
        fname = self.func.__name__
        func = getattr(sage, fname)
        args = [arg._sage_() for arg in self.args]
        return func
```

do you already have the same `_sage_` there?
