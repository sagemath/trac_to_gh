After a week of debugging I think that this is the unique to pass the tests in french_book.recequadiff :
in test : 
383   sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
the integer 3/2  (Sage Integer) makes necessary the modifications (you suggested) to composition function:
u(n+2) is sympy
(3/2)*u(n+1) is sage 
...
...



the error in
388 sage: rsolve(f, u(n), {u(0):-1,u(1):1})
is caused by the fact that Sympy integer are not imported.

Before the sympy patch there was not error but for me it was not correct:
because the expressions mixed sympy (u,n) and sage quantities (1/2).

sage: n = var('n', domain='integer'); u = function('u')

IMHO yes, because this is a different issue; the new ticket could be about implementing `rsolve` in Sage, as an interface to sympy's `rsolve`. 

The doctest discussed here is used as an example on page 17 of this document:
https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/recequadiff.pdf ,
which is a chapter of the English translation of the so-called "French book" (*Calcul mathématique avec Sage*). The latter is currently in its final preparatory stage, cf. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/MalKzTyvrys .
One should probably ask the authors to update this example (the book is not likely to be out before Sage 8.1, where the current ticket could be effective).

<a id='comment:55'></a>I understand what changes with that import statement, every Integer becomes a Sympy Integer because the preparser replaces things like `1` with `Integer(1)`. I strongly believe we should be testing behavior that mixes Sage and Sympy, as this is a very natural thing to do (in Sage), so I disagree with changing the test and also [1b5227d](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=1b5227d6a85a540663aa138e8304a9055ba110fd).

<a id='comment:59'></a>I think this is the real problem with all of this:

```
sage: from sympy import Symbol
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(1+n).args[1] == n
False
```
The roundtrip of a sympy symbol through Sage results in a different symbol:

```
sage: m = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: m == n
True
sage: p = Symbol('n')
sage: p == n
False

sage: sympy.simplify(SR(n)).assumptions0
{'commutative': True}
sage: n.assumptions0
{'algebraic': True,
 'commutative': True,
 'complex': True,
 'hermitian': True,
 'imaginary': False,
 'integer': True,
 'irrational': False,
 'noninteger': False,
 'rational': True,
 'real': True,
 'transcendental': False}
sage: p is sympy.sympify(SR(n))
True
```
So I think we need to translate assumptions over to truly fix the problem.

Indeed, the test, as it is, is quite unnatural from a Sage's user point of view: the import of specific Sympy objects (in the line `from sympy import Function, Symbol`) and their mixing with some Sage objects (in the line `f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)`), with *implicit* conversions Sage <--> Sympy involved, without any user control on them, is not something desirable.

I don't think it is that unnatural as someone who wants to use sympy, something that we do suggest to people, would construct something in that fashion. One of the benefits of Sage are those implicit conversions so that users should not have to worry about them.
