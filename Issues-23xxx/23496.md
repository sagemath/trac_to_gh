Is the setting this to needs_work a double-post-type error or is there an actual issue?

Also, could you ping upstream again? It would be good to know that they accepted the patch as-is.

I think that you should create a dependency on this ticket in your (#20204).
This ticket was created to separate the sympy patch from the modifications done in Sage.
This ticket is yet a dependency of #22802

Replying to [mforets](#comment%3A46):
> @man74cio : i don't understand the last two commits. those changes are changing the purpose of this ticket. what do you think about[comment:43](#comment%3A43)?



After a week of debugging I think that this is the unique to pass the tests in french_book.recequadiff :
in test : 
383   sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
the integer 3/2  (Sage Integer) makes necessary the modifications (you suggested) to composition function:
u(n+2) is sympy
(3/2)*u(n+1) is sage 
...
...



the error in
388 sage: rsolve(f, u(n), {u(0):-1,u(1):1})
is caused by the fact that Sympy integer are not imported.

Before the sympy patch there was not error but for me it was not correct:
because the expressions mixed sympy (u,n) and sage quantities (1/2).

what i find odd is that:

- using `n = Symbol('n')` in the `rsolve` test it works,
- similarly but using `from sympy.abc import n`.

to move on, i propose to modify the test as below, and report the failing use case in a new ticket.

```
sage: n = var('n', domain='integer'); u = function('u')
sage: f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)
sage: us = u._sympy_() ; fs = f._sympy_();
sage: from sympy import rsolve; rsolve(fs, us(n), {us(0):-1,us(1):1})
3 - 4*2**(-n)
```

what do you think?

IMHO yes, because this is a different issue; the new ticket could be about implementing `rsolve` in Sage, as an interface to sympy's `rsolve`. 

The doctest discussed here is used as an example on page 17 of this document:
https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/recequadiff.pdf ,
which is a chapter of the English translation of the so-called "French book" (*Calcul mathématique avec Sage*). The latter is currently in its final preparatory stage, cf. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/MalKzTyvrys .
One should probably ask the authors to update this example (the book is not likely to be out before Sage 8.1, where the current ticket could be effective).

I think this is the real problem with all of this:

```
sage: from sympy import Symbol
sage: n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: sympy.sympify(1+n).args[1] == n
False
```
The roundtrip of a sympy symbol through Sage results in a different symbol:

```
sage: m = Symbol('n', integer=True)
sage: m == n
True
sage: p = Symbol('n')
sage: p == n
False

sage: sympy.simplify(SR(n)).assumptions0
{'commutative': True}
sage: n.assumptions0
{'algebraic': True,
 'commutative': True,
 'complex': True,
 'hermitian': True,
 'imaginary': False,
 'integer': True,
 'irrational': False,
 'noninteger': False,
 'rational': True,
 'real': True,
 'transcendental': False}
sage: p is sympy.sympify(SR(n))
True
```
So I think we need to translate assumptions over to truly fix the problem.

Indeed, the test, as it is, is quite unnatural from a Sage's user point of view: the import of specific Sympy objects (in the line `from sympy import Function, Symbol`) and their mixing with some Sage objects (in the line `f = u(n+2)-(3/2)*u(n+1)+(1/2)*u(n)`), with *implicit* conversions Sage <--> Sympy involved, without any user control on them, is not something desirable.

I don't think it is that unnatural as someone who wants to use sympy, something that we do suggest to people, would construct something in that fashion. One of the benefits of Sage are those implicit conversions so that users should not have to worry about them.

However, that discussion aside, I think that we should keep as close to the original doctest because it is in Calcul Mathématique avec Sage (even if it is out of date). So I believe we should just change the order of multiplication of the coefficients as in[comment:56](#comment%3A56) and add a warning about it.

hi, thank you all for the help debugging. with this sympy patch (at sympy/core/function.py and on top of #20204), it works for me:

```
class AppliedUndef(Function):
    """
    Base class for expressions resulting from the application of an undefined
    function.
    """
    .
    .
    .
    def _sage_(self):
        import sage.all as sage
        fname = self.func.__name__
        func = getattr(sage, fname)
        args = [arg._sage_() for arg in self.args]
        return func
```

do you already have the same `_sage_` there?
