With `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, I ran

```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f python3
```

and now when I try to rebuild Cython on top of that with

```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f cython
```

I get

```
[cython-0.26] gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3)
[cython-0.26] ****************************************************
[cython-0.26] Unable to find pgen, not compiling formal grammar.
[cython-0.26] Uninstalling Cython-0.26:

```

Same if I try reinstalling Cython with `SAGE_DEBUG=no`.  Just to be sure I rebuild python3 without debug, and was able to install Cython again with no problem, so it really seems to be something about the specific combination of `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and python3.
