```
With `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, I ran

```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f python3
```

and now when I try to rebuild Cython on top of that with

```
SAGE_DEBUG=yes ./sage -f cython
```

I get

```
[cython-0.26] gcc version 4.8.4 (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04.3)

```

Same if I try reinstalling Cython with `SAGE_DEBUG=no`.  Just to be sure I rebuild python3 without debug, and was able to install Cython again with no problem, so it really seems to be something about the specific combination of `SAGE_DEBUG=yes` and python3.

I think this is some bad combination of hacky code (that I wrote) IIRC in `sage-pip-install`, `pip-lock`, and Python 3 with debug flags and hence more chatty with `ResourceWarning`s.
