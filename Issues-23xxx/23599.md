I noticed that one could do.


```
E = EllipticCurve(QQ, "35a2")
E.local_data(ZZ(5)); 
```
but not

```
E.local_data(QQ(5));
```

However, if we base change to a number field `K`, it works if we pass an element of `K`

```
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
E = EllipticCurve([1 + i, 0, 1, 0, 0])
E.local_data(2*i + 1)
E.local_data(K(3))
```
but

```
E.local_data(3)
```
woudln't.

I tried to fix that.

ps: the right implementation here should be along the lines, 

```
P = K.fractional_ideal(P)
if P.is_prime():
    if K is QQ:
        return P.gen();
    else:
        return P;
```
but `QQ` doesn't have fractional ideals, see #23595
