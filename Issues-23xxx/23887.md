This code provides an implementation of the Koszul operator, which takes as input an object of type differential_form_element and returns an object of the same type.  The operation acts on the coefficients of the differential form, which must be polynomials, and raises their degree by one, while also decreasing the order of the differential form.  A reference for this operator can be found, for instance, on page 29 of Arnold, Falk, and Winther "Finite element exterior calculus, homological techniques, and applications."

No problem, and welcome to Sage!

Yeah, using the git trac command is the easiest method.  Let me know if you have any questions, and I can try to help out.
