This code provides an implementation of the Koszul operator, which takes as input an object of type differential_form_element and returns an object of the same type.  The operation acts on the coefficients of the differential form, which must be polynomials, and raises their degree by one, while also decreasing the order of the differential form.  A reference for this operator can be found, for instance, on page 29 of Arnold, Falk, and Winther "Finite element exterior calculus, homological techniques, and applications." Acta numerica 15 (2006): 1-155. See commit 8cb3cce from user akgillette

I am an undergraduate student working on a project with my advisor. This is the first time either of us have submitted a ticket to Sage so it appears we didn't do it correctly. Our apologies. Should we try again using the git-trac command as explained here?

No problem, and welcome to Sage!

Yeah, using the git trac command is the easiest method.  Let me know if you have any questions, and I can try to help out.

Here are a few things from Sage's conventions http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html which should be addressed:\n- Currently your code is in a file placed in the root directory of Sage.
