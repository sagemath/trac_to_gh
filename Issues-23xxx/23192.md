Currently this is trivial

```
sage: G = GaussianIntegers()
sage: G.some_elements()
[1]
```

The changes introduced here, make a problem with gcd/xgcd in number fields visible, see #23274. This is however not an issue introduced by this ticket, so it is not within the scope of this ticket to fix it (and not even a dependency imho.)

I tried to choose "typical" elements, please let me know if you think this is not done in a good way.

> Is `length` ever `== 1`?


I don't know if we want to consider cases like that, but the user can define degenerate extensions such as


```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(t)
sage: Z = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: Z.basis()
[1]
```

that is why I added that test.

Anyway, I will change the rest, and that test too if you think that it is irrelevant.

Oh, I did not know that this was "allowed". You should definitely leave the test in then.
You could probably add a doctest for this, saying something like

```

This also works for trivial extensions::

Yes you are right, currently I would divide by zero if one of the extensions is trivial with a generator equal to 0 or -1. But if I use `relative_degree`, I can still divide by zero if the last extension is not trivial but there is a trivial one in the tower.

One thing I can do is just test `gen == 0` and add only `gen` to the lists of elements if it is zero, otherwise add `gen` and `gen**(-1)`.

But then, since `gen` can be anything, I can add some elements two times, e.g. if gen is 1. It is probably not a big problem...
