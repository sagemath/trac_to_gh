Currently this is trivial

```
sage: G = GaussianIntegers()
sage: G.some_elements()
[1]
```

The changes introduced here, make a problem with gcd/xgcd in number fields visible, see #23274. This is however not an issue introduced by this ticket, so it is not within the scope of this ticket to fix it (and not even a dependency imho.)

This looks already quite good. A few minor comments (sorry that it's so many…nothing of this is really important):
1. Many places in the documentation talk about `self` but it is usually best to avoid this (because people who don't know Python, don't understand it - and it also sounds unnatural.) So it is better to talk about "this number field" and "this order" instead.
2. For a similar reason, you should not mention the parameter `self` in the INPUT section. From a user's perspective, these methods take no parameters, so the INPUT section can go away.
3. Since the OUTPUT section does not say anything different from the first line of the docstring, you could as well just leave it out, but it also does not hurt.
4. In docstrings, it is usually considered more readable, to write `t^2 - 2` instead of `t^2-2`, i.e., use spaces around `+` and `-`.
5. I would probably not print the polynomial rings, since their not of interest here.
6. Is `length` ever `== 1`?

Replying to [@saraedum](#comment%3A3):
> Is `length` ever `== 1`?

I don't know if we want to consider cases like that, but the user can define degenerate extensions such as


```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(t)
sage: Z = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: Z.basis()
[1]
```

that is why I added that test.

Anyway, I will change the rest, and that test too if you think that it is irrelevant.

Oh, I did not know that this was "allowed". You should definitely leave the test in then.
You could probably add a doctest for this, saying something like

```
TESTS:

This also works for trivial extensions::

sage: ... your example ...
```
to make this clear for anybody who stumbles upon this.

Yes you are right, currently I would divide by zero if one of the extensions is trivial with a generator equal to 0 or -1. But if I use `relative_degree`, I can still divide by zero if the last extension is not trivial but there is a trivial one in the tower.

One thing I can do is just test `gen == 0` and add only `gen` to the lists of elements if it is zero, otherwise add `gen` and `gen**(-1)`.

But then, since `gen` can be anything, I can add some elements two times, e.g. if gen is 1. It is probably not a big problem...
