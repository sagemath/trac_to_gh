Currently this is trivial

```
sage: G = GaussianIntegers()
sage: G.some_elements()
[1]
```

The changes introduced here, make a problem with gcd/xgcd in number fields visible, see #23274. This is however not an issue introduced by this ticket, so it is not within the scope of this ticket to fix it (and not even a dependency imho.)

<a id='comment:4'></a>Replying to [comment:3 saraedum]:
> Is `length` ever `== 1`?


I don't know if we want to consider cases like that, but the user can define degenerate extensions such as


```
sage: R.<t> = QQ[]
sage: K.<a> = QQ.extension(t)
sage: Z = K.ring_of_integers()
sage: Z.basis()
[1]
```

that is why I added that test.

Anyway, I will change the rest, and that test too if you think that it is irrelevant.

Oh, I did not know that this was "allowed". You should definitely leave the test in then.
You could probably add a doctest for this, saying something like

```
TESTS:

This also works for trivial extensions::

sage: ... your example ...
```
