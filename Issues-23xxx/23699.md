We want to model the following:
Let A be a finite abelian group. A (symmetric) torsion bilinear form is
b: A x A --> QQ/ZZ.

A torsion quadratic form is
q: A --> QQ/2ZZ
such that q(na)=n*n*q(a)   a for a in A.

This class should consist of:

- an Abelian group with a distinguished basis
- an "inner product matrix" defining the bilinear/quadratic form.
- Elements should have methods to compute q and b

It should behave much like sage/modules/free_quadratic_module

methods should include:
- create a free quadratic submodule from generators
- orthogonal complements
- a canonical form
- isomorphisms
- brown invariants
- the orthogonal decompositions into its p-primary parts

Keywords: sd91, sd90

<a id='comment:39'></a>Some questions:

- Should we import `TorsionQuadraticModule` and `IntegralLattice` into the global namespace? I feel like there are more natural constructions for these modules, say as a quotient object and by using vector space constructions. That way we do not pollute the global namespace. There probably is a stronger case not to import the former, but it is good to avoid both.
- Is `free_quadratic_module_integer_symmetric.py` included in the documentation? I don't see it in `modules/index.rst`.

Some comments:

- You should do tests with `TestSuite(foo).run()`.
- Your `TorsionQuadraticModuleElement.__init__` docstring closing `"""` is not correctly indented.
- It should be ```self``` in docstrings since it is Python code.
- Try to keep lines <79 characters, especially in documentation.
- Not every method has tests (`__init__` is a good place for the `TestSuite(foo).run()` and is where I always put them).
- Change this and similar for Python3 and general Python error string conventions
  {{{#!diff
-ValueError, "The modulus must divide (V,W)."
+ValueError("the modulus must divide (V,W)")
  }}}
- `INPUT:` items do not end with a period/full-stop.
- Many one-line descriptions are missing a period/full-stop.
- `gram_matrix_quadratic` `OUTPUT:` is over indented.

<a id='comment:41'></a>O.K. the use case that I have in mind is to create a `TorsionQuadraticModule` from an
`IntegralLattice`. So there is indeed no use to pollute the global namespace. 

You are right, one could check if a `free_quadratic_module` is an `IntegralLattice` in the `FreeQuadraticModule` factory function. Do we want that?

I any case I want an `IntegralLattice` factory function in the global namespace.
At the moment it has little functionality, but later I plan to extend its functionality to create
lattices from keywords, like the ADE-lattices, Leech, ... or an interface with the lmfdb.

<a id='comment:45'></a>Fair enough. This is not my area of expertise, so if you think it is useful, then I have no objections other than it should be a `lazy_import`. My suggestion stemmed from thinking such a construction would be similar to this:

```
sage: V = (ZZ^3).span([[1/2,5,2],[3/7,2,-1],[1/3,1/5,-2]])
```

Also, one other minor doc point, in `free_quadratic_module_integer_symmetric.py`, the examples in the module-level docstring are over-indented.

Ursula, are you going to be handling the rest of the review, or at least the mathematical side?
