```
lcalc doesn't use standard C++:

- `using namespace std;` needs an include with stuff from `std::` before it
    
- `typeof` is a gcc extension - C++11 has `decltype` instead
    
- plain C must not be compiled with C++ compiler - thus a makefile change

The next question is how to ensure that the compiler then uses c++11. lcalc doesn't have a configure script so we cannot do it there.  At the very least `spkg-install` will need to insert `-std=c++11` in `CXXFLAGS` to make sure you are always using c++11.

We may assume that all the C++ compilers we care about support `-std=c++11`, right?
So this may be an independent of clang tickets thing?

I think Dima started this with the view of compiling sage with `-std=c++11`. If that's what he is doing, getting https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585 in would be more pressing in my opinion.

indeed, and as a part of the clang porting effort too - it's just too much trouble to have different packages with different `c++xy` IMHO, especially if one depends on the another, they better be on the same `xy`...

Somehow I cannot manage to achieve this; 
it all works if I do

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./sage -f lcalc
```
but somehow does not work if I put into spkg-install

```
$MAKE CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

some evil Makefile magic that escapes me here. :-(

no difference, it still does not work. It might be due to the Makefile modifying
CXXFLAGS: it does

```
CXXFLAGS := -O3 $(OPENMP_FLAG) $(PREPROCESSOR_DEFINE) $(MACHINE_SPECIFIC_FLAGS) $(EXTRA) $(CXXFLAGS)

<a id='comment:76'></a>OK some comments on the review from Jeroen which made me dig a bit deeper on the Makefile. I must say I adopted a slightly different approach in sage-on-gentoo so I don't have the same patch, but some of lesson learnt will definitely apply.

Point of difference with sage-on-gentoo: because pari headers are included in two files with `#include "pari.h"` the makefile has to define the location of pari headers and so do any code that include these headers. Decided that it was not worth it and patched to have `#include "pari/pari.h"` which is more sane and means that we don't have to worry about adding non standard includes. That means that I cut an extra bit of the makefile too. If people think that's a good idea I'll include that change in sage too.

I have checked clang-6 and gcc-8.2. Now if someone would put a kind review.

Although Dima, I kept the patch name "using_namespace_std.patch` but there is hardly any of that in there. Just removing GNU-ism. Did you have more stuff to do in mind?
