```
lcalc doesn't use standard C++:

- `using namespace std;` needs an include with stuff from `std::` before it
    
- `typeof` is a gcc extension - C++11 has `decltype` instead
    
- plain C must not be compiled with C++ compiler - thus a makefile change

this is needed for building lcalc with `-std=c++11`.
(tested so far with clang 4.0.1 on Linux, with `stdlib=libc++`)

Only the top commit is of interest. Perhaps it can be based on rc0 indeed. But I need sleep now :-)

OK :)

The next question is how to ensure that the compiler then uses c++11. lcalc doesn't have a configure script so we cannot do it there.  At the very least `spkg-install` will need to insert `-std=c++11` in `CXXFLAGS` to make sure you are always using c++11.

the other problem here is an incorrect building of lcalc extension. Here C++ is compiled with a C compiler, which is patently wrong.
Any idea how this can be fixed?

We may assume that all the C++ compilers we care about support `-std=c++11`, right?
So this may be an independent of clang tickets thing?

Yes. This is https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585 the patch needed for that is included in the gentoo patch tarball for python.

indeed, and as a part of the clang porting effort too - it's just too much trouble to have different packages with different `c++xy` IMHO, especially if one depends on the another, they better be on the same `xy`...

Somehow I cannot manage to achieve this; 
it all works if I do

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./sage -f lcalc
```
but somehow does not work if I put into spkg-install

```
$MAKE CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

some evil Makefile magic that escapes me here. :-(

this is the branch, as here are the results of running 

```
./sage -f lcalc
```
http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/lcalc-1.23.p16.log

vs the result of running

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./sage -f lcalc
```
http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/externalCXXFLAGS_lcalc-1.23.p16.log

As you see in the 1st log CXXFLAGS are ignored.
Tested on Fedora25 as well as on Gentoo.
What am I missing?!!

PS. F25 bash is 4.3.43(1)-release, and make is 4.1.

This is outcommented in the github lcalc version which also, with the above PR, passes clang-check. It looks like an improvement. OTOH this ticket seems no longer pressing, as the Sage version compiles with clang too.

I think it is time we move forward with this again. I think this ticket should also include the matching patch from arch in sagelib https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/plain/trunk/sagemath-lcalc-c++11.patch?h=packages/sagemath&id=0e31ae526ab7c6b5c0bfacb3f8b1c4fd490035aa so that we really are just using C++11 and allow us to make progress on #25532.

Any objections to moving forward with what we have now?

Well, I tried to see if I could up ntl separately in sage-on-gentoo and sage wouldn't compile. It could be that I can tweak ntl's configuration to be compatible (at possible cost in ntl internal) but I'd rather get rid of the last bit of sage that is c++11 resistant (I think) and go with the natural flow again.

OK some comments on the review from Jeroen which made me dig a bit deeper on the Makefile. I must say I adopted a slightly different approach in sage-on-gentoo so I don't have the same patch, but some of lesson learnt will definitely apply.

* the original makefile defines CC as as g++ so that has to go.
* Non standard flags like CCFLAGS are used, so Dima tried to use appropriate flags for both C and C++ compilers. And it also differentiate C and C++ flags which wasn't done before because even regular C code was passed to the C++ compiler.
* The downside of using CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS inside the makefile is that regular options passed from the sage build system may need care if we want to inject them. That's a sage-on-gentoo difference I use `MYCXXFLAGS` so I can include whatever other flags we pass without worry.

Point of difference with sage-on-gentoo: because pari headers are included in two files with `#include "pari.h"` the makefile has to define the location of pari headers and so do any code that include these headers. Decided that it was not worth it and patched to have `#include "pari/pari.h"` which is more sane and means that we don't have to worry about adding non standard includes. That means that I cut an extra bit of the makefile too. If people think that's a good idea I'll include that change in sage too.

I have checked clang-6 and gcc-8.2. Now if someone would put a kind review.

Although Dima, I kept the patch name "using_namespace_std.patch` but there is hardly any of that in there. Just removing GNU-ism. Did you have more stuff to do in mind?
