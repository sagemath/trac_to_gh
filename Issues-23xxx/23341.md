```
lcalc doesn't use standard C++:

- `using namespace std;` needs an include with stuff from `std::` before it
    
- `typeof` is a gcc extension - C++11 has `decltype` instead
    
- plain C must not be compiled with C++ compiler - thus a makefile change

this is needed for building lcalc with `-std=c++11`.
(tested so far with clang 4.0.1 on Linux, with `stdlib=libc++`)

Only the top commit is of interest. Perhaps it can be based on rc0 indeed. But I need sleep now :-)

The next question is how to ensure that the compiler then uses c++11. lcalc doesn't have a configure script so we cannot do it there.  At the very least `spkg-install` will need to insert `-std=c++11` in `CXXFLAGS` to make sure you are always using c++11.

Yes. This is https://bugs.python.org/issue1222585 the patch needed for that is included in the gentoo patch tarball for python.

indeed, and as a part of the clang porting effort too - it's just too much trouble to have different packages with different `c++xy` IMHO, especially if one depends on the another, they better be on the same `xy`...

Somehow I cannot manage to achieve this; 
it all works if I do

```
CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11" ./sage -f lcalc
```
but somehow does not work if I put into spkg-install

```
$MAKE CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

some evil Makefile magic that escapes me here. :-(

I must say I adopted a slightly different approach in sage-on-gentoo so I don't have the same patch, but some of lesson learnt will definitely apply.\n\n* the original makefile defines CC as as g++ so that has to go.\n* Non standard flags like CCFLAGS are used, so Dima tried to use appropriate flags for both C and C++ compilers. And it also differentiate C and C++ flags which wasn't done before because even regular C code was passed to the C++ compiler.\n* The downside of using CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS inside the makefile is that regular options passed from the sage build system may need care if we want to inject them.

OK some comments on the review from Jeroen which made me dig a bit deeper on the Makefile. I must say I adopted a slightly different approach in sage-on-gentoo so I don't have the same patch, but some of lesson learnt will definitely apply.

* the original makefile defines CC as as g++ so that has to go.
* Non standard flags like CCFLAGS are used, so Dima tried to use appropriate flags for both C and C++ compilers. And it also differentiate C and C++ flags which wasn't done before because even regular C code was passed to the C++ compiler.
* The downside of using CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS inside the makefile is that regular options passed from the sage build system may need care if we want to inject them. That's a sage-on-gentoo difference I use `MYCXXFLAGS` so I can include whatever other flags we pass without worry.
* Jeroen points out the standard rule for `.c` file should be used for `cmdline.c` except that the current patch erroneously define the rule as using CXXFLAGS instead of CFLAGS. Oopsie.

Point of difference with sage-on-gentoo: because pari headers are included in two files with `#include "pari.h"` the makefile has to define the location of pari headers and so do any code that include these headers. Decided that it was not worth it and patched to have `#include "pari/pari.h"` which is more sane and means that we don't have to worry about adding non standard includes. That means that I cut an extra bit of the makefile too. If people think that's a good idea I'll include that change in sage too.
