If `algorithm="ncg"` is used in the top-level `minimize` function, one should be able to work with Python functions, as with the other algorithms.

<a id='comment:1'></a>For instance, this use case is currently broken:

```
sage: f = lambda x : 100*(x[1]-x[0]^2)^2+(1-x[0])^2+100*(x[2]-x[1]^2)^2+(1-x[1])^2
sage: gradient = lambda x : scipy.array([400*(x[0]**2 - x[1])*x[0] + 2*x[0] - 2, \
                                    -200*x[0]**2 + 400*(x[1]**2 - x[2])*x[1] + 202*x[1] - 2, \
                                     -200*x[1]**2 + 200*x[2]])
sage: x0 = [.1,.3,.4]
sage: minimize(f, x0, gradient, algorithm="ncg")
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'min' referenced before assignment
```

but it shouldn't, since this works:

```
sage: import scipy
sage: from scipy import optimize
sage: optimize.fmin_ncg(f, [float(_) for _ in x0], fprime=gradient, disp=True)
Optimization terminated successfully.
...
array([ 0.99999732,  0.99999463,  0.99998926])
```

Moreover, the Hessian can also be passed to ncg (but it's optional => docstring is inaccurate)

```
sage: hessian = lambda x : [[1200*x[0]^2 - 400*x[1] + 2, -400*x[0], 0], \
                    [-400*x[0], 1200*x[1]^2 - 400*x[2] + 202, -400*x[1]], \
                    [0, -400*x[1], 200]]
sage: optimize.fmin_ncg(f, [float(_) for _ in x0], fprime=gradient, fhess=hessian, disp=True)
Optimization terminated successfully.
...
array([ 1.,  1.,  1.])
```

Hence, in the current if clause of `algorithm=="ncg"` one does not need to compute & pass both `hessian` and `hessian_p`, but just one of them, i think.
