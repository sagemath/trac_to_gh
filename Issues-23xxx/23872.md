Given an implicitly defined function `y(z) = z \Phi(y(z))`, there is a well-known approach (Analytic Combinatorics, Flajolet+Sedgewick, Chapter VI.7) on how to determine a singular expansion for `y(z)`.

This branch adds a new asymptotic generator which computes this singular expansion.

Thanks, fixed.

As far as I was able to check, the code yields correct results in both the periodic as well as the aperiodic case. I am, however, inclined to improve the documentation a little bit before putting this up for review (more examples + tests; maybe even a description of the algorithm? Also, a reference to The Book would probably be a good idea).

<a id='comment:20'></a>Thanks, I've cross-reviewed your changes, LGTM.

There is now also the "final" method, `InverseFunctionAnalysis`, returning the asymptotic expansion of the coefficient growth via singularity analysis.

Note that currently there is a minor issue with this method: in case `tau` is not specified when calling the method (or when `tau` is symbolic), this leads to a coercion problem to be solved at #23921.
