Hello,

Given that we are trying to move into python3, should we preparse 

```
print foo
```
into

```
print(foo)
```
with deprecation warning? 

This will make sure that old code, written in python2 style could still run, and not fail because of a miserable print.

Cheers,

Edgar

I understand your point of view, however, with that approach, a lot of homemade code will get broken whenever we do the switch because of a print.

Just consider the case of someone running a long term computation and at the end, it will fail because the user tried to print the result. However, his code run totally fine in the previous version of sage.

You should never do a long term computation without testing small cases first. If you test your own code properly, what you describe shouldn't happen.

Besides, there are many more ways how a long term computation could break.

I agree an alternative is to deprecate the 

```
print foo
```
just before we switch to python3.

Making print a function is straightforward:

It basically boils down to making `from `__future__` import print_function` the default in the sage interface if we want to do it before switching to Py3 and doing nothing if we don't.

Now for the preparser bit (that's the relatively hard part):

It's very easy to detect if there's a `print-statement related syntax error`: That's just `print<not followed by whitespace*\(>` (a regex should be able to do that). The tricky bit is to decide what to do next. If we assume that this is indeed a print statement, I guess that whatever comes after it (until newline of ";") must be the argument, so probably a reasonable guess is to put that whole thing between parentheses.
Doing that should probably be accompanied with a warning.

I think this is actually not that bad to do: we're only rewriting code that would otherwise be a syntax error.

Of course there are cases we don't catch, because there are print statements in python2 that are also valid syntax in python3, but with a different result:

Python 2:

```
>>> print(1,2)
(1, 2)
```

Python3:

```
>>> print(1,2)
1 2
```

I don't think there's anything we can do about that. Our only option is to interpret it as valid Py3.

**Note:** It's tempting to reach into "2to3" and use its fixer for print. I don't think that will work very well, because 2to3 actually constructs a parse tree. Probably sage's preparser would be much nicer if it did that too, but it doesn't. So integrating [2to3's fixer](https://bitbucket.org/python_mirrors/2to3/src/8c5b845c14fc3a4f51371531c911745817abd87f/lib2to3/fixes/fix_print.py) would be painful.

I agree with these two comments. The change to Python 3 will most likely break Python 2 written code as there are a lot more incompatible changes than `print`. I do not think, that `print` should be an exception here.

Therefore a -1 for using the preparser for this.
