This two-line patch in Sage allows us to use an unpatched pari in Debian - which is maintained by upstream pari who does not want to apply Sage's "ignore stack warnings" patch.

It works by ignoring the pari stack warnings in the doctest parser instead.

(Stack warnings will still appear during Sage's normal usage, but one can optionally use a patched pari to avoid these if one needs to.)

Right, I was just thinking about Debian...

Anyway, I still think that this patch has no place in the Sage doctest framework.
