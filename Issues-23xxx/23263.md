This two-line patch in Sage allows us to use an unpatched pari in Debian - which is maintained by upstream pari who does not want to apply Sage's "ignore stack warnings" patch.

It works by ignoring the pari stack warnings in the doctest parser instead.

(Stack warnings will still appear during Sage's normal usage, but one can optionally use a patched pari to avoid these if one needs to.)

I don't really get the point of this patch. We are still patching PARI, so which problem does this fix? I think this branch should be applied by distros if they feel the need, not by Sage.

I don't want to overcomplicate our doctest framework just because upstream PARI is so stubborn to insist that debug messages should be shown unconditionally with no way to disable them. The correct solution here is fixing PARI, not Sage.
