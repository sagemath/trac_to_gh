```
This two-line patch in Sage allows us to use an unpatched pari in Debian - which is maintained by upstream pari who does not want to apply Sage's "ignore stack warnings" patch.

It works by ignoring the pari stack warnings in the doctest parser instead.

(Stack warnings will still appear during Sage's normal usage, but one can optionally use a patched pari to avoid these if one needs to.)

I don't really get the point of this patch. We are still patching PARI, so which problem does this fix? I think this branch should be applied by distros if they feel the need, not by Sage.

I don't want to overcomplicate our doctest framework just because upstream PARI is so stubborn to insist that debug messages should be shown unconditionally with no way to disable them. The correct solution here is fixing PARI, not Sage.

OK, I found [the thread](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/archives/pari-dev-1601/threads.html#00013) and I can agree that the PARI position does not make much sense. Today is 2017, stack size warnings should at best be considered "memory debugging messages" and not in the same category as other types of warnings.

Nevertheless, this patch would help other distros packages Sage more quickly. It is small, but the amount of small things like this in Sage quickly adds up to a major time sink when packaging. Yes, we can keep carrying this in Debian if you don't agree, it's up to you.

When I find some time I'll try to re-raise this issue on the pari mailing list.

To be honest, I mostly have strong feelings about the upstream PARI patch that they do not want to accept (why???). It feels like accepting this ticket in Sage is like admitting defeat. So I certainly won't set this to positive_review.

On the other hand, if this patch makes other people's lives easier, then I will not veto this patch.
