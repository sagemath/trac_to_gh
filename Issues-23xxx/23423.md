```
sage: X = SchubertPolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: a = X([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: a.divided_difference(4)
```
This should yield `0`, not an error. Elements of X are polynomials in infinitely many variables; when they don't use a variable, it doesn't mean that this variable cannot be divided-differenced over.

Followup to #23403.

Depends on #23403

I can do it, but it might take me a little longer to push right now. However, it was somewhat a question of seeing if you agree; granted, I didn't phrase it like I should have.

> I'm fine with `if i in ZZ` instead of `if isinstance(i, (Integer, int))`, if this is what you mean.

Yes, it is. The rationale: if by chance a user is doing 2/2, it will still work. Granted, this is not likely to happen, but I've had it happen to me enough that I'm paranoid about it now.
