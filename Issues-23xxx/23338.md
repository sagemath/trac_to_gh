This ticket cleans up the `PolynomialRing()` function in many ways. Mainly:

1. Use `normalize_names()` as much as possible to deal with variable names.

2. Fix indentation in docstring.

3. Pass arguments like `sparse` and `implementation` as `**kwds` to the single-variate or multi-variate polynomial constructor.

4. Make the code easier to understand.

5. Allow `PolynomialRing(..., implementation="singular")` which forces Singular. This allows simplifying some code in `src/sage/algebras/free_algebra.py` which currently needs to jump through hoops to get a `MPolynomialRing_libsingular`.

6. Check more error conditions, for example currently we have

```
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, name="x", names="y")
Univariate Polynomial Ring in y over Rational Field
```

7. Change some arguments of `PolynomialRing()` to keyword-only arguments. This does break some existing uses of `PolynomialRing()`, although much more likely in library code and not user code (some code in Sage gets this even wrong and was passing `sparse="lex"` instead of `order="lex"`)

Apart from items 6 and 7, no existing functionality is changed.

My quick comments are:

- The indentation of the doc looks off for the numbered points. The subsequent lines of text should start at the same place the first line did (unless you want it to be further indented).
- In handling the case `R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')`, you should normalize the names there so that `kwnames != names` is a valid comparison (e.g., `names='x,y'` should be valid input).
- You also almost already check for `R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')` in the no `var_array` block.
- We probably can/should handle the `R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')` input entirely in the no `var_array` block.
- Should I interpret the `[m, ...]` as extra input here?

  ```
  4. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, n, [m, ...,] var_array=var_array, ...)``
  ```
  It is confusing with what might be a list. It might be better to do:

  ```
  4. ``PolynomialRing(base_ring, n0, ..., nm, var_array=var_array, ...)``
  ```
- Your code has some slightly sneaky logic for some corner cases like `PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x', 1, var_array='x')` not being valid input. It would be good to have some tests for `var_array` input.

No, the current code is intentional. I only want to support

```
R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x,y")
```
and not

```
R = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x,y", names="x,y")
```
The preparser passes `names` already normalized, so there is no reason to call `normalize_names()` on `kwnames`.

> - You also almost already check for `R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')` in the no `var_array` block.
 
What do you mean with this?

> - We probably can/should handle the `R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 'x')` input entirely in the no var_array block.


Well, that would make the code slightly more complicated since that check needs to be done *after* `normalize_names()`. Also, I see no reason to a priori disallow something like

```
R.<x0,x1> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2, var_array=["x"])
```
Yes, it's stupid to write that but we do allow the analogous thing without `var_array`.

Right. I didn't care much about `var_array` since it's not widely used (there isn't a single place in the Sage library or documentation where it is used, except for the `PolynomialRing` constructor itself). Still, you are right that additional doctests would be good.

Most of the code that checks for input of this form is already in the code path when `var_array` is not being used. I feel like it should go there. However, this is moot because...

I did the initial implementation because I got a few requests to have such a feature (which is useful for doing matrices with generic parameters). So I care a little bit. :)

I'm wondering if we should always have a one variable implementation always be a univariate polynomial ring, of course with `implementation='singular'` being an exception to construct the multivariate polynomial ring? This should be uncontroversial as it only expands functionality.

I don't agree that it only expands functionality. In at least 2 places, the Sage library has been using `PolynomialRing(R, 1, "x")` as a contrived way to get a multivariate polynomial ring implemented in Singular. Of course, this can now be done using `PolynomialRing(R, "x", implementation="singular")`. For this reason, I would maybe give a deprecation warning for `PolynomialRing(R, 1, "x")` but *not* change functionality yet.

Fair enough. Although in some ways changing the behavior makes the doctests a little moot...but one could directly call the constructor class (or pass `implementation="singular"`). However, it is beyond the scope of the ticket in a way, so I'm fine doing this on another ticket.
