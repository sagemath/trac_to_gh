The following problem showed up with 8.0.beta8: the copy of an IndexedFreeModuleElement seems to be not functional:

```sage
sage: F=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: a=F.an_element() ; a
3*B[-1] + B[0] + 3*B[1]
sage: copy(a)
<repr(<sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class at 0x7f5d735e7808>) failed: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'>
sage: type(copy(a)._monomial_coefficients)
<type 'NoneType'>

What's the use case where this showed up?

> What's the use case where this showed up?

I was reparenting an element from one module to a slightly altered clone of its parent (so I was probably violating the immutability assumption regarding elements, of which I was unaware). My code was similar to this:

```sage
def corresponding_element_in_clone(parent,elem):
   N = parent.create_modified_clone(parent)
   x = copy(elem)
   x._set_parent(N)
   return x
```
Using "deepcopy" seems to still work.

This isn't quite your question, but if you wanted to (safely) manipulate the underlying `dict`, you could get get a copy by calling `d = x.monomial_coefficients()`, mutating that, and then `F._from_dict(d)` (with appropriate options, probably `coerce=False` and `remove_zeros=False`). Yet, you're not changing the \"defining\" information of the object, just what parent it is associated to.

Very strong -1 on the [comment:12](#comment:12) proposal. It is a hack and only applies to `CFM` elements.

I think it should be sufficient to do

```
def __copy__(self):
    return self
def __deepcopy__(self):
    return self
```
in `IndexedFreeModuleElement`. Although perhaps the `__deepcopy__` can actually copy the dictionary (to be more in line with copy vs deepcopy).
