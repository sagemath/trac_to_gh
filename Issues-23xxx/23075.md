The following problem showed up with 8.0.beta8: the copy of an IndexedFreeModuleElement seems to be not functional:

```sage
sage: F=CombinatorialFreeModule(ZZ,ZZ)
sage: a=F.an_element() ; a
3*B[-1] + B[0] + 3*B[1]
sage: copy(a)
<repr(<sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class at 0x7f5d735e7808>) failed: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'items'>
sage: type(copy(a)._monomial_coefficients)
<type 'NoneType'>
```

Hmm, that's due to the fact that _monomial_coefficients is a Cython attribute now, so not automatically copied. So we need a custom `copy` method. We have to decide whether we want `copy(x)` to just return `x` (since it's supposed to be immutable) or really make a copy.

What's the use case where this showed up?

I was reparenting an element from one module to a slightly altered clone of its parent (so I was probably violating the immutability assumption regarding elements, of which I was unaware). My code was similar to this:

```sage
def corresponding_element_in_clone(parent,elem):
   N = parent.create_modified_clone(parent)
   x = copy(elem)
   x._set_parent(N)
   return x
```
Using "deepcopy" seems to still work.
