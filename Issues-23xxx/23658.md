```
The implementation contains an infinite loop that is broken when a quantity is less than or equal to 1, however the loop never ends on the following input:

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.fractional_chromatic_index(solver="GLPK")
```

The problem seems to depend on the LP solver, using PPL seems to work just fine. Issue seems to be GLPK and CBC/Coin.

<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

another fix is to change the stop condition to 

```
if sum((x[2] for x in matching)) <= 1 + 1e-9:
    break
```

with GLPK, we add multiple times the same constraint

```
Adding a constraint on matching : [(0, 5, 0.9999999999999999), (1, 2, 3.3306690738754696e-16), (6, 9, 1.4802973661668753e-16)]
```
and we can check that

```
sage: M = [(0, 5, 0.999999999999), (1, 6, 9.999778782798785e-13), (7, 9, 2.0000667788622195e-12)]
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),10)
1.0
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),11)
1.0
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),12)
1.000000000002
```

This is similar with Coin and I believe that it could also happen with `Cplex/Gurobi/...` on some graphs.

these kinds of absolute bounds don't scale well.
While I didn't try, I guess taking a sufficiently big example
will render this broken, still.

There are several pointers in the source on how to improve it, perhaps
they should be explored, on another ticket.

Choosing `PPL` sounds reasonable since it is also the default in `Polyhedron`. In the current branch, I see only some spacing missing. Otherwise, looks good.
