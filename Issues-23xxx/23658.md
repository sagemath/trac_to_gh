The implementation contains an infinite loop that is broken when a quantity is less than or equal to 1, however the loop never ends on the following input:

```
sage: g=graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: g.fractional_chromatic_index(solver="GLPK")
```

The problem seems to depend on the LP solver, using PPL seems to work just fine. Issue seems to be GLPK and CBC/Coin.

another fix is to change the stop condition to 

```
if sum((x[2] for x in matching)) <= 1 + 1e-9:
    break
```

with GLPK, we add multiple times the same constraint

```
Adding a constraint on matching : [(0, 5, 0.9999999999999999), (1, 2, 3.3306690738754696e-16), (6, 9, 1.4802973661668753e-16)]
```
and we can check that

```
sage: M = [(0, 5, 0.999999999999), (1, 6, 9.999778782798785e-13), (7, 9, 2.0000667788622195e-12)]
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),10)
1.0
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),11)
1.0
sage: round(sum(e[2] for e in M),12)
1.000000000002
```

This is similar with Coin and I believe that it could also happen with `Cplex/Gurobi/...` on some graphs.

these kinds of absolute bounds don't scale well.
While I didn't try, I guess taking a sufficiently big example
will render this broken, still.

There are several pointers in the source on how to improve it, perhaps
they should be explored, on another ticket.

So which branch should be used?

Choosing `PPL` sounds reasonable since it is also the default in `Polyhedron`. In the current branch, I see only some spacing missing. Otherwise, looks good.
