This is a requirement now that `Permutations(n)` are in the category of Coxeter groups.

This was originally noticed by:

```
sage: Permutations(4)([1,4,3,2]).weak_covers()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

```

+            index set, i.e., starting at `1`. If you want them to
+            start at `0`, set the keyword ``from_zero`` to ``False``.

That should be "... to ``True``".
