Right now the method `_coerce_map_from_` of `ClusterAlgebra` references a variable before actually defining it:

```
sage: A = ClusterAlgebra(['A',2])
sage: AA = ClusterAlgebra(['A',3])
sage: A.has_coerce_map_from(AA)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'f' referenced before assignment
```
