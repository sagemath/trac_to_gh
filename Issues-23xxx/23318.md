<a id='comment:8'></a>It might be closer to bikeshedding, but IMO I think it should be

```diff
-Return the additive order of `x`.
+Return the additive order of ``x``.
```
since `x` is referring to the argument, which is a "code" object.

It's outside the scope of this ticket, but just as a note: the `coerce` function should not be here, nor does it strictly do coercions (i.e., it tries a conversion afterwards).
