Currently the quo_rem method of multipolynomial_libsingular only relies on Singular if the base ring is a field.

For the case of integers, it falls back to a very slow python implementation. However, Singular can handle that case too.

With simple cases the differences are not significant. But when we go to slightly larger cases, we have a huge improvement.

With an example taken from [1].

Before:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t,u> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = (1 + x + y + 2*z^2 + 3*t^3 + 5*u^5)^5
sage: g = (1 + u + t + 2*z^2 + 3*y^3 + 5*x^5)^5
sage: p = f*g
sage: %time _ = p.quo_rem(f)
CPU times: user 5.69 s, sys: 5 ms, total: 5.69 s
Wall time: 5.71 s
```

After:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z,t,u> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: f = (1 + x + y + 2*z^2 + 3*t^3 + 5*u^5)^5
sage: g = (1 + u + t + 2*z^2 + 3*y^3 + 5*x^5)^5
sage: p = f*g
sage: %time _ = p.quo_rem(f)
CPU times: user 79 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 79 ms
Wall time: 79.3 ms
```

If we raise the exponent of f and g to 6, according to [1] the previous implementation goes to more than 100 seconds. The singular one gets about half a second.

Yes, perhaps soon `algorithm="FLINT"` might become an option!

I guess we would like to have a completely new class for multivariate polynomials using flint, not just using the division from flint.
So let's get this in already.
