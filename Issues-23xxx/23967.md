The following should be possible:

```
sage: A = ZZ^2sage: S1 = B.submodule(B.gens()[:1])
sage: S1 = B.submodule(B.gens()[:1])
sage: S2 = B.submodule(B.gens()[1:])
sage: s1 = S1.gens()[0]; s2 = S2.gens()[0]
sage: s1+s2
Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for +: 'Finitely generated module V/W over Integer Ring with invariants (2)' and 'Finitely generated module V/W over Integer Ring with invariants (2)'
```

Let V1,V2,W1,W2 be modules in the same ambient space with V1 containing W1 and V2 containing W2

Let a in V1/W1 and b in V2/W2. Their sum a + b
is well defined as an element of
(V1+V2)/(W1+W2)

I did a fairly significant rewrite to make the implementation closer to `QuotientFunctor`. Specifically, the quotients are determined by the relations module `W`, so that is all that should be used to define the functor. I also moved the functor out of the (IMO) overcrowded `categories/pushout.py` for better code localization.

If my changes are good, then positive review after you set your name in both the authors and reviewers section.

I have tried to make it behave like a subspace functor.
In future module constructions can be more complicated like
`VectorFunctor`, direct, sum, base extension, some quotient, and a tensor product.
So the functor might have to deal with all kinds of other functors.

Why do you fix the `base_ring`? The vector functor and subspace functor do not. 
And also the quotient functor does not fix a ring.

With your method, construction of `QQ / ZZ` is fine. 
base extensions when more general pids than `ZZ` are finally allowed do not work well with the functor. We could extract the basering as basering of the input. Or/and make it an optional argument of the call?

I am very strongly in support of `self` in docstrings as the rest is too verbose and does not behave well with subclasses.

That has no bearing on this functor's implementation.

`QuotientFunctor` is `Rings` to `Rings`, so there is no base rings involved with the categories. In this case, we are doing a quotient by a module that has a specific base ring `R`. So it makes sense to be a functor from `R`-mod to `R`-mod. For `VectorFunctor`, there is not a specific way to specify the base ring. However, if you feel strongly that we should have larger categories for the domain and codomain, then we can change it.

I'm not sure I understand what you're proposing. I do not agree that extension of scalars is a part of this functor. I feel that should be an entirely different functor.
