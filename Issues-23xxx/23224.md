```
Namely

```
sage: bool(log(8)- 3*log(2))
True
sage: bool(log(8)==3*log(2))
False
```
compared to

```
sage: cmp(log(8),3*log(2))
0
```

And cmp should be going away in python3.

In principle Maxima should simplify `log(8)-3*log(2)` so it's a missing enhancement there. See https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/258 for an enhancement that can provide another solution.
