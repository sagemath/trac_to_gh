I propose to get rid of `src/bin/sage-arch-env` and `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-64.txt`, which is a very specialized mechanism of storing a bit of configuration in SAGE_LOCAL. Instead, `SAGE64` should simply be replaced by adding `-m64` in `$CC` or `$CFLAGS` and maybe setting `ABI=64`. See #24596.

Since `CFLAG64` is only used to support `SAGE64`, this implies that `CFLAG64` is no longer used either.

Is anybody actually using that option? I would go for deprecating it and getting rid of it eventually.

I added two deprecation warnings: once at the beginning and once at the end of the file `build/make/install`: at the beginning so that it appears near the start and is there if someone interrupts the build with ctrl-C, and at the end so that it is clearly displayed. (If I put it in `sage-arch-env` instead, it gets buried with all of the other build messages.) I tested with `SAGE64=yes make`.

I asked on sage-devel whether anyone is using this. Let's wait a bit for responses.

A proper way to do this is to allow something like `--abi=32/64` (or `ABI=32/64`) to `./configure`, and
not doing dodgy and error-prone setting of  `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `FFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, etc etc

In particular, ABI and `-m64` should persist, i.e. written by `./configure` to the Makefile or something like this.

First of all, I don't know what you mean with "build Sage in one go".

Second, regardless of what you mean: is it a regression? Suppose that the following are true:

(A) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *without* this patch.

(B) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *with* this patch.

In these are both true (since I don't know what you mean, I can't say whether that is the case), then your complaint is not meaningful.

In Atlas configuration you did the following:

```
-conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
+conf['32bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '32bit')
```
This is a different logic for `conf['32bit?']` vs. the originally intended one.
By right, you should have just done

```
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
...

```

It's not clear. The ticket description does not mention it, but in several places
you remove special-casing for it.

Just as a note, this will currently conflict with most of the tickets listed under

[This is the Trac macro *TicketQuery* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (keywords~=destdir))](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#TicketQuery-macro)

However, I will merge this branch into those tickets and add this ticket as a dependency.  This one should definitely be merged first though.
