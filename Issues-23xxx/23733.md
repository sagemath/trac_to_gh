I propose to get rid of `src/bin/sage-arch-env` and `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-64.txt`, which is a very specialized mechanism of storing a bit of configuration in SAGE_LOCAL. Instead, `SAGE64` should simply be replaced by adding `-m64` in `$CC` or `$CFLAGS` and maybe setting `ABI=64`. See #24596.

Since `CFLAG64` is only used to support `SAGE64`, this implies that `CFLAG64` is no longer used either.

Is anybody actually using that option? I would go for deprecating it and getting rid of it eventually.

<a id='comment:17'></a>(Disclaimer: Last time I used Solaris was 10 years ago.)  The only time that I remember using the ABI environment variable was for configuring GMP if one wants to do a 32-bit build on 64-bit hardware - a quirk of GMP's configuration scripts. I don't think it's a standard variable at all.

First of all, I don't know what you mean with "build Sage in one go".

Second, regardless of what you mean: is it a regression? Suppose that the following are true:

(A) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *without* this patch.

(B) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *with* this patch.

In these are both true (since I don't know what you mean, I can't say whether that is the case), then your complaint is not meaningful.
