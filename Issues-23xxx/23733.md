I propose to get rid of `src/bin/sage-arch-env` and `$SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-64.txt`, which is a very specialized mechanism of storing a bit of configuration in SAGE_LOCAL. Instead, `SAGE64` should simply be replaced by adding `-m64` in `$CC` or `$CFLAGS` and maybe setting `ABI=64`. See #24596.

Since `CFLAG64` is only used to support `SAGE64`, this implies that `CFLAG64` is no longer used either.

Is anybody actually using that option? I would go for deprecating it and getting rid of it eventually.

I asked on sage-devel whether anyone is using this. Let's wait a bit for responses.

A proper way to do this is to allow something like `--abi=32/64` (or `ABI=32/64`) to `./configure`, and
not doing dodgy and error-prone setting of  `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `FCFLAGS`, `FFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS`, etc etc
to take `-m64/32`.

In particular, ABI and `-m64` should persist, i.e. written by `./configure` to the Makefile or something like this.

As well, numpy's (and all the other packages that like to test stuff without `CFLAGS` etc set to non-empty values) spkg-install will break, as `-m64` won't be passed. 
The current version of this spkg-install modifies `CC` to include the flag.

We cannot and should not modify `CC` globally to have flags in them, as there might be places where `CC` is assumed not to have spaces (GAP is one such place, I think).

First of all, I don't know what you mean with "build Sage in one go".

Second, regardless of what you mean: is it a regression? Suppose that the following are true:

(A) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *without* this patch.

(B) It is impossible to build Sage in one go *with* this patch.

In these are both true (since I don't know what you mean, I can't say whether that is the case), then your complaint is not meaningful.

In Atlas configuration you did the following:

```
-conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
+conf['32bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '32bit')
```
This is a different logic for `conf['32bit?']` vs. the originally intended one.
By right, you should have just done

```
+conf['64bit?'] = (conf['bits'] == '64bit')
conf['32bit?'] = not conf['64bit?']
...

```

It's not clear. The ticket description does not mention it, but in several places
you remove special-casing for it.
