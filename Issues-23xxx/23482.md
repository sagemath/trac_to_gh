I checked out the ticket branch, ran `./sage -ba` to rebuild all of Sage including all the Cython, and ran `./sage -tp 2 --long src/sage/categories/morphism.pyx` to run the relevant doctests. However, one doctest failed, as the output below shows:

```bash

    cumulative wall time: 0.7 seconds
```

It seems like this failure is coming from the fact that the objects used in the doctests rely on `RingHomomorphism_coercion`, whose removal and replacement was proposed in [ticket:23204 #23204] but which this ticket isn't listed as being dependent on.

I am not sure what the owner of this ticket would prefer to do at this point.

Setting to needs work because missing reviewer name.

However, I think this should be done independently of #23204, which just means writing a little smarter doctest:

```
sage: Hom(QQ, QQ).identity()
Identity endomorphism of Rational Field
```
