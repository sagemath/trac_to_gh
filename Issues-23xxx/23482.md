It seems like this failure is coming from the fact that the objects used in the doctests rely on `RingHomomorphism_coercion`, whose removal and replacement was proposed in [ticket:23204 #23204] but which this ticket isn't listed as being dependent on.

I am not sure what the owner of this ticket would prefer to do at this point.
