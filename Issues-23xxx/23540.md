pyopenssl introduced a deprecation in their latest release 17.2.0 (released on 25th of July), see [#658](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/pull/658). As a consequence, when this version is installed is Sagemath, Twisted produces warnings. These warnings appear in various places, in particular when we quit the console

```
sage: quit

After installing `service_identity` as adviced it gets a little bit better
