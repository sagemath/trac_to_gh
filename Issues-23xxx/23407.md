Various extension modules implemented in C are linked with `-lstdc++`. I cannot think of a reason for this, but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Note that we already automatically add `-lstdc++` for C++ modules. This is implemented in `sage_create_extension()` in `src/setup.py`

It built fine on Cygwin with this patch.  I haven't run the tests yet and will do so now, but I can't imagine there's any reason the tests would fail if the build didn't fail, given how sensitive Windows is with build time linking issues.
