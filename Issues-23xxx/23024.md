The Sage wrappers around [ppl](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/) are now superseded by the standalone [pplpy](https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy) (Python/Cython compatible). This ticket proposes to replace `src/sage/libs/ppl.pyx` extension with pplpy. For this, we

- create a new standard package pplpy
- upgrade gmpy2 from optional to standard
- replace the Sage code calling sage/libs/ppl.pyx to call pplpy
- make appropriate deprecation for `sage.libs.ppl`

**Tarball** for pplpy: [pplpy-0.8.4.tar.gz](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fe/f4/765628c74624cea90cc6f260d222dcfc1dff520a54e0f8cc5d67c602d638/pplpy-0.8.4.tar.gz)

Your branch appears in red which means that there are merge issues (possibly trivial). Would be better to rebase it on the latest beta.

<a id='comment:9'></a>1) Pickling should be fixed

```diff
-        sage: TestSuite(Asso).run()
+        sage: TestSuite(Asso).run(skip='_test_pickling')
```
It works with `pplpy` used from Python

```
>>> x = ppl.Variable(0)
>>> y = ppl.Variable(1)
>>> z = ppl.Variable(2)
>>> gs.insert(ppl.point(x+y+2*z))
>>> gs.insert(ppl.point(x-y))
>>> gs.insert(ppl.point(z))
>>> P = ppl.C_Polyhedron(gs)
>>> import pickle
>>> pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(P)) == P
True
```


2) I don't see the point of the function `mpz_to_sage_integer`. You can just do `[Integer(x) for x in my_mpz_list]`. For example

```
v_coords = (1,) + tuple(mpz_to_sage_integer(v.coefficients()))
```
can be replaced by

```
v_coords = (1,) + tuple(Integer(c) for c in v.coefficients())
```
Moreover, the name is confusing since the fuction converts a **list** of mpz integers.

3) Some possible simplifications

- In `ppl_backend.pyx`:
`Integer(g.coefficient(Variable(variable))) / Integer(g.divisor())` -> 
`Rational(g.coefficient(Variable(variable)) / g.divisor())`

- In `ppl_lattice_polytope.py`: `assert Integer(v.divisor()).is_one()` -> `assert v.divisor() == 1`

It will be nice, but coercion for gmpy2 types is required for doing this (#23052).

Where? The first involves a direct call `Rational(mpq_type)` and the second comparison between `mpz` and Python integer. Which operation is mixing gmpy2 types with Sage types?

+The Sage wrappers around [ppl](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/) is now superseded by the stand alone [pplpy](https://github.com/videlec/pplpy/) (!Python/!Cython compatible). This ticket proposes to replace `sage/src/libs/ppl.pyx` extension with pplpy.

+- pplpy and gmpy2 must be standard packages.
+- list any ticket proposing to extend ppl functionalities in Sage (if yes, open issues on github with cross links)
+- see if anybody changed sage/libs/ppl.pyx since the fork (if yes, list the commit and port them into pplpy)

The aim is not to keep `sage.libs.ppl` but to just to have some indirection in the import so that you do not break user's code. As `sage.libs.ppl` will not here anymore I do not expect the full doctesuite to pass as it used to be. But the following kind of things should work (and be doctested)

```
sage: from sage.libs.ppl import Variable, Constraint_System, C_Polyhedron
UserWarning: proper deprecation message
sage: x = Variable(0)
sage: y = Variable(1)
sage: cs = Constraint_System()
sage: cs.insert(x >= 0)
sage: cs.insert(x <= 3)
sage: cs.insert(y >= 0)
sage: cs.insert(y <= 3)
sage: poly_from_constraints = C_Polyhedron(cs)
```
And the various objects constructed above are of course from pplpy.

You can have a look at other places in the sage code and look for "deprecation" and "lazy_import".

\\

In this case you compare a python `int` with a `gmpy2.mpz`. \\

But with sage's `Integer` : 

```

It does build documentation if you ask it to. Tough it does not install anything (perhaps it should?). But even with properly installed documentation, I don't see how to make linking work properly.

That's because `LatticePolytope_PPL_class` now inherit from pplpy's `C_Polyhedron` and therefore `LatticePolytope_PPL_class` is not a `SageObject`.

I can try. \\
But i can see a potential problem here: most packages seems to install documentation on if `[This is the Trac macro *"$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes * that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#"$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes -macro)`. \\
If we do the same for pplpy, given `$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS` default value is not `yes` that mean that the links will be broken by default.

I think there is many distinct questions :\\
- 1. Should we install a pplpy documentation ?
- 2. If yes should we install it only if `"$SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS" = yes` ?
- 3. If yes to 1. and yes to 2. should we link the sagemaths documentation with pplpy's.

I don't know what is the way to proceed. See https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/issues/12

For now I would say:
- remove all links in the Sage documentation
- in each relevant module, make a reference to the pplpy development website (https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy) and pplpy documentation website (http://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/pplpy/latest/).

<a id='comment:99'></a>I've left comments in https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/issues/12

It's too early to start blindly removing links to docs, probably there is a more intelligent way to preserve what is already there.

**SAGE_SPKG_INSTALL_DOCS** - if set to yes, then install package-specific documentation to $SAGE_ROOT/local/share/doc/PACKAGE_NAME/ when an spkg is installed. This option may not be supported by all spkgs. Some spkgs might also assume that certain programs are available on the system (for example, latex or pdflatex).

<a id='comment:6'></a>`ef89978` Implements the compilation and installation of pplpy's documentation.

The current implementation drawback is that pplpy is compiled two times (one time for package installation and one time using "inplace" build in preparation for sphinx).

To avoid that i am looking for an elegant and generic way to express `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$SAGE_DESTDIR_LOCAL/lib/python2.7/site-packages`.

I haven't find an environment variable for `lib/python2.7/site-packages` or something equivalent.

Any help is welcomed.

<a id='comment:2'></a>Yes, this is the discussion link https://groups.google.com/forum/?#!topic/sage-devel/qoxVng1__0A.

The discussion/objections where more about what types pplpy should return (Sage numbers or gmpy2 numbers).

The last 3 messages for gmpy2 solution have never been answered, but rereading the thread it's true that it doesn't mean that we have an explicit consensus.

I put this ticket on hold in wait for better solution for generating documentation.\\

I will repost on the discussion thread when this ticket is ready.

the question is - are you prepared to patch pplpy sources?
Comparing their docs/Makefile with https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/blob/master/doc/Makefile
seems to say that there are sphinx options one might try to use to do everything in one build, not in two.

The PPL Coefficient type is hardcoded in the Cython wrapper as

```
ctypedef mpz_class PPL_Coefficient
```
This implies that all computations with pplpy are done with GMP mpz. I agree that PPL supports computations with `mpz_class`, `mpq_class` as well as various native integer types (from `char` to `long long`). Nothing has changed on this side yet. This feature request is disjoint from this ticket which aims to be a simple transition from Sage source code to standalone library.

I wonder if there shouldn't be something like this mentioned in the developer docs (do we have a style guide)?

This is a comment I've made in review on dozens of tickets at this point.

Short list comprehensions (it's trickier when they get nested) are *often* clearer than any alternative, and are usually much more efficient from the Python interpreter's standpoint as well.

<a id='comment:9'></a>That was quick, thank you :)

Not sure yet if it's a showstopper, but I'm also having a weird problem with error handling in the gmpy2 in Sage.  This following example should raise a `TypeError` exception:

```
$ python -c 'import gmpy2;  gmpy2.is_fermat_prp(1234, "a")'
Aborted (core dumped)
```

I also built the latest gmpy2 from source, and when I run it in that source tree I get the correct behavior:

```
$ python -c 'import gmpy2;  gmpy2.is_fermat_prp(1234, "a")'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: is_fermat_prp() requires 2 integer arguments
```

Perhaps it was just a bug in gmpy2 that has since been fixed upstream?  Not sure.

Indeed, it is not supported anymore. Also you can not cache a `PPL_C_Polyhedron`: https://gitlab.com/videlec/pplpy/blob/master/ppl/polyhedron.pyx#L86-102

In sage, the pplpy polyhedra are only used as attribute from which the user is not supposed to have direct access (unless she knows very well what she is doing). The higher level `Polyhedron_base` still implements this mutability flag.

Could you give a concrete example of a problematic behavior?
