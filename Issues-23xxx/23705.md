A small patchbot complaint (I have none): the print statements in the documentation should now use python 3 syntax. The following is (almost) wrong

```
sage: print gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False) # not tested
```
I agree that this is not tested but the patchbot is not smart enough.

Just a question: I noticed that the tests are written as `.py` files, but they don't contain any Python code at all. So why was the choice made for `.py` as format, as opposed to `.rst` for example?

There was no particular reason for using `*.py` and I'd be open to suggestions for better alternatives.
