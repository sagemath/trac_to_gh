The default for symbolic factorization should be changed. Maxima as default should be replaced with a call to Pynac's `factor()` implementation, which itself uses Singular at the moment. Maxima should be made available via `ex.factor(algorithm=...)`.

As an example of performance gain here one of the Fateman benchmarks:

```
sage: var('a b c k s y z')
(a, b, c, k, s, y, z)
sage: f = (1+x+y+z)^20+1
sage: g = (f*(f+1)).expand()
sage: %time _=g.factor()
```
This takes 11 seconds on 8.1.beta5 and 3.3 seconds with Pynac factor (identical time using polynomial ring).

While I do not see as big of a speed difference (9.5s to 3.2s), it still is quite an improvement. So positive review.
