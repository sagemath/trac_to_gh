As [reported](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/1VHx3laSU_U/wFxF2JsABwAJ) on sage-devel

```
S = GF(2^4, 'a')
a = S.gen()

G = SL(2, S)

g1 = G([a**2, a**3 + a**2 + a, a + 1, 0])
g2 = G([a, 0, 0, a**3 + 1])

# prints True True
print g1 in G, g2 in G

# Throws a ValueError
print g1 * g2
```
Specifically, one gets

```
ValueError: the given finite field has incompatible size
```

The actual underlying bug is the fact that the `GapElement_FiniteField.sage` method malfunctions when an explicit `ring` argument is specified and the element lies in a subfield of the field passed in that argument (note that GAP performs such reductions automatically).
One would reasonably expect this to work, but a `ValueError` is thrown on the last line:

```
sage: n = libgap.eval('Z(2^4)^2 + Z(2^4)^1 + Z(2^4)^0')
sage: n
Z(2^2)^2
sage: n.sage(ring=GF(2^4))
ValueError: the given finite field has incompatible size
```

This fix looks as if it might lead to a huge slowdown.
Would it be possible to avoid this test and creation of a field completely?

Sorry, missed your comments before I wrapped it all up and submitted it for review, assumed such comments would be part of the review.

* Should I revert the ticket's status?
* Regarding the slowdown resulting from the test and creation of a field: 
  * What test are you referring to? The modulus?
  * I'm not sure what to replace the field creation with and what's considered cheap/expensive in Sage/GAP. What would you recommend? We could cut straight to the `PrimitiveRoot` for example by using GAP's `Z(...)` and plugging in the desired field's size, but I know nothing about GAP's implementation details and whether it creates the parent field anyway.
* Regarding the finite fields with non-default (non-Conway) modulus polynomial:
  * I actually looked into this as a separate issue/bug as part of researching a fix for this ticket, but I haven't submitted anything yet.
  * The `_gap_init_()` string for Sage fields completely ignores the modulus polynomial - the conversion is lossy, and you get `F.<x> = GF(2)['x']; libgap(GF(2^18, 'x')) == libgap(GF(2^18, 'x', modulus=x**18 + x**16 + x**11 + x**4 + 1))` printing `True`

A comment about your code; you create a lot of temporary variables without a reason; one does not need `compatible`, `gap_field_obj`, and `gap_field`, right?
Could you get rid of them?

Otherwise, your patch looks good; I now realise that because we deal with only "standard" finite fields here, for them `PrimitiveRoot` is instant.
(this would not be true for extensions specified by arbitrary primitive polynomials).

Regarding the latter (finite fields with non-default (non-Conway) modulus polynomial); so you think they are not handled in libGAP? If so, could you please open a ticket to deal with this?

No problem getting rid of them, just thought they make the code more readable (are these temporaries a performance concern?).
I mean, in principal one could inline the entire second `else` clause to a huge one-liner, but that would be rather unreadable :)

I was under the impression that the field creation within GAP might be performance issue, not the `PrimitiveRoot` lookup (which, by the way, was there before the patch).
We could also cut straight to `root = make_GapElement_FiniteField(self.parent(), gap_eval(ring.multiplicative_generator()._gap_init_()))`, but it may be worse.

Regarding the finite fields with non-default (non-Conway) modulus polynomials, see `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_base.pyx`, method `FiniteField._gap_init_`.
Adding such support would be lengthier, as we may need to audit all Sage-finite-field-to-GAP-finite-field bridges and make sure they make no assumptions about the modulus being non-default, e.g. `src/sage/rings/finite_rings/element_ntl_gf2e.pyx` method `FiniteField_ntl_gf2eElement._gap_init_` (where it is *explicitly blocked*).

They are, but once you try doing things in e.g. `SL(2, F)` the field elements are coerced back and forth (GAP-to-NTL and vice versa):

```
sage: G = SL(2, 2**24)
sage: G.generators()
...
TypeError: sage() takes no keyword arguments
```

This is because the objects being coerced are deduced as generic `GapElement`s instead of FFEs.
Perhaps I should move this discussion to sage-devel.

I'm not very well acquainted with the development cycle (and didn't see anything about it on the developer guide), am I supposed to merge it to develop or is that on one of the admins?

the rest is normally done by the release manager, no need to do anything at this point on your side.
