There currently are two problems related with pickling of `Matrix_gfpn_dense`: 
- When a string is provided as argument to `__init__`, it is interpreted as the name of a file from which data are read by some MeatAxe command. If the file doesn't exist, it was intended to have an uninitialised matrix (to be properly initialised later). But currently it crashes, which needs to be fixed.
- The number of bytes used holding the data of a matrix row is machine independent. However, the number of bytes actually used to store the row always is a multiple of `sizeof(long)`, which is machine dependent (at least in theory). Pickling should of course only involve the machine independent memory chunks, but currently it involves the machine dependent chunks.

You also said I should split my original patchbomb into smaller parts. That's why I wanted to leave the transition from `str` to `bytes` for a ticket dedicated to cleaning code.

In the latest commit, I add a test that should demonstrate machine independence of pickling (provided that the patchbots provide a whole lot of different architectures, including little and big endian and different sizes of `long`). I also add a test that triggers the deprecation warning.

I am not really happy about doing part of the code cleanup here. Would you accept to do all cleanup on a separate ticket. If you do, then please consider this ticket as "needs review".

It's just a bit strange that you write "unclean" code in one ticket and then at the same time have another ticket to clean it up.

But that's not a big deal since the old code also uses strings.

When unpickling, it seems that there is no protecting against reading out of bounds. The case where `x` is too short should be handled gracefully. The code should be more like:

```
if len(Data) == expected_size:
    # Handle new-style pickle
elif len(Data) == expected_size_for_old_pickle:
    # Handle deprecated pickle
else:
    raise ValueError(f"expected a pickle with {expected_size} bytes, got {len(Data)} instead")
```
EDIT: note the swapped conditions. It is possible that `expected_size == expected_size_for_old_pickle`.

And a small detail: you write twice `x = PyString_AsString(Data)` while once (outside the branch) should be sufficient.

Right. And you spotted further problems with the code added by this ticket.

So, I guess it is better to clean the new code, although it will imply manual merging in other tickets.

This is a potential division by zero:

```
cdef size_t pickled_rowsize = lenData//nr
```
It would be good to add a doctest for the case `nr == 0`.

I think the best solution is to replace the condition `if Data` by `if nr`.

I don't like your fix for this for several reasons:

1. I can't actually reproduce the issue. Without this patch, the doctest that you added passes. I think this is because the memory for Python objects is automatically initialized with all zeros.

2. If the result of `__cinit__` is really invalid in some way, then it means that there is something wrong with `__cinit__`. Most importantly, `__cinit__` should already return an object which doesn't cause segfaults.

3. A non-existing file should be an error, not something to be silently ignored.

4. Do you really need to open the file in Python and then close it and then let MeatAxe open it again? At a minimum, you should document in a comment why you are doing it this way.

From reading the code, I think the best solution would be to remove `__cinit__` completely and handle all initialization in `__init__`.

Strange. has there been a recent change in Cython? If I recall correctly, reading from a non-existing file left the matrix in an undefined state. In particular, it was possible that the `self.Data` pointer was *not* NULL.

OK.

If it is really the case that I can rely on `self.Data` being initialised to NULL, then I guess removing `__cinit__` is fine.

That is the case, provided that `self.Data` is correctly initialised to NULL by cython.

There is something wrong with the indentation here:

```
        5. Creating a matrix from a file in MeatAxe format. If the file doesn't exist,
            an error raised by the MeatAxe library is propagated::

            sage: Matrix_gfpn_dense('foobarNONEXISTING_FILE')       # optional: meataxe
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            SystemError: .../foobarNONEXISTING_FILE: No such file or directory in file os.c (line 254)
```
Correct indentation would be

(note the double space after `5.` to make allow 4 spaces of indentation on the next line)

I do use uninitialised meataxe matrices in some application (of course in my group cohomology package), namely when I want to create a `Matrix_gfpn_dense` from an existing `Matrix_t*`. But your suggestion makes perfect sense.

I would argue that the *proper* way to get an "uninitialised meataxe matrix" is precisely to do `Matrix_gfpn_dense.__new__(Matrix_gfpn_dense)`.

This idiom of using `__new__` and then manually filling in a data structure is used a lot in Sage. For example, in the `numerator` method for rational numbers:

```
    def numerator(self):
        cdef Integer n = Integer.__new__(Integer)
        n.set_from_mpz(mpq_numref(self.value))
        return n
```

Yes, `six` is needed to make things Python 3 compliant.

However, Cython is a language by itself. Cython is not Python 2 and it's not Python 3. Cython tries to be compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. This makes porting Cython code to Python 3 much easier than porting Python code.

Of course, some Cython code is really just Python code and that code can depend on the Python version. And there are some incompatibilities that Cython cannot fix: support for `__cmp__` is gone in Python 3, there is nothing that Cython can do about that.

If you want an error being raised on `Matrix_gfpn_dense('')`, then I need to re-introduce the test `if not parent` (but then raise an error). Is that OK for you?

In any case, changing the function header of `MatLoad` should be done.

Thank you for testing on different architectures!

So, what shall we do with that test?
- On the one hand, that test is about a pickling format that is known to be machine dependent and is therefore deprecated. That's an argument for removing it (which I would like to avoid).
- On the other hand, I could try to do better and make unpickling work in that case as well.

I think I prefer the second way.
