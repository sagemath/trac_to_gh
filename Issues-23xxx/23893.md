Right now one has:

sage -i beautifulsoup

***************************************************************
Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily
during this run of 'make beautifulsoup'):

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.

Makefile:16: recipe for target 'beautifulsoup' failed
make: *** [beautifulsoup] Error 1
```

However this does not need to fail since it succeeds after:

```
sage -i openssl
sage -f python2
```
