Approximant bases, or sigma bases, or order bases, are in their original form relaxations of kernel bases of polynomial matrices which behave extremely nicely. They generalise Pad√© approximation and have many uses in their own right, and they also appear as an important step in many asymptotically fast algorithms that have been developed in recent years.

Relation bases is a more recently studied concept, but a natural generalisation of approximant basis. Mathematically it differs sufficiently to merit a new name.

This ticket introduces an interface for approximant bases and relation basis, and gives rudimentary algorithms for computing them using row reduction of polynomial matrices. The interface is prepared to support faster, specialised algorithms for common cases.
