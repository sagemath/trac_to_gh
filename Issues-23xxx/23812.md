<a id='comment:9'></a>This is maybe not the definitive word. If you feel you can do better quickly, please do.

Nethertheless, there are not so many casting to bytes:

```
git grep -c "<bytes>" *.pyx
src/sage/libs/ecl.pyx:2
src/sage/libs/homfly.pyx:1
src/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/cvxopt_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/cvxopt_sdp_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/ppl_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/rings/integer.pyx:1
```
and integer.pyx is certainly the most important place where we need to correct the casting to bytes.
