This is maybe not the definitive word. If you feel you can do better quickly, please do.

Nethertheless, there are not so many casting to bytes:

```
git grep -c "<bytes>" *.pyx
src/sage/libs/ecl.pyx:2
src/sage/libs/homfly.pyx:1
src/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/cvxopt_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/cvxopt_sdp_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/numerical/backends/ppl_backend.pyx:1
src/sage/rings/integer.pyx:1
```
and integer.pyx is certainly the most important place where we need to correct the casting to bytes.

Replying to [chapoton](#comment%3A9):
> Nethertheless, there are not so many casting to bytes:


I think most of the time, the `bytes` is implicit because it's just what corresponds to `char *` in C. For example, in code like

```
def f():
    cdef char* cstr = ....
    return cstr
```
Cython will automatically convert `cstr` to Python `bytes`. Since Sage deals with a lot of C libraries, I would guess that this happens in a lot of places.
