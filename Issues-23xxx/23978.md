Currently, there is an absolute ordering forced onto free modules.
Mathematically this ordering has only little meaning.

This ticket is to order free modules by inclusion. This is a partial order.
More precisely:
- Ambient spaces/modules compare equal iff their basering, rank, and inner_product_matrix are equal.
- Two ambient modules compare `A <= B` if their rank and inner_product matrix are equal and `A.base_ring()` is a subring of `B.base_ring()`
- Two submodules `S1`, `S2` compare only if they lie in the same ambient (space/module). Here same means they compare equal with `==` as defined above.

Some of the old doctests are missing. We should never loose doctests. For example I did not find

```
        We test that :trac:`5525` is fixed::

            sage: A = (QQ^1).span([[1/3]],ZZ); B = (QQ^1).span([[1]],ZZ);
            sage: A.intersection(B)
            Free module of degree 1 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
            Echelon basis matrix:
            [1]
```

Or 

```
        Comparison with a quotient module (see :trac:`10513`)::

            sage: M = QQ^3 / [[1,2,3]]
            sage: V = QQ^2
            sage: V == M
            False
            sage: M == V
            False
```
Check if other doctests are missing as well.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:22\" align=\"right\">comment:22</div>\n\nthe is_contained method is a good idea. Though I am unsure about the name.\nHere are a few comments:\n\n- We compare modules A and B. Module B has more structure than A.\n  If we can give A the the same type of extra structure as B in a canonical way then \n  A and B should be compared as modules with extra structure. I would expect the user to care about the extra structure.\n  Or short: compare everything that you can as long as it makes sense.\n  Example:\n\n```\nsage: A = ZZ^2\nsage: B = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,2,matrix.identity(2)*2)\nsage: A == B\nFalse\n```\n- Module equality should use ``echelonized_basis_matrix()`` where possible for example over Fields and ZZ.

the is_contained method is a good idea. Though I am unsure about the name.
Here are a few comments:

- We compare modules A and B. Module B has more structure than A.
  If we can give A the the same type of extra structure as B in a canonical way then 
  A and B should be compared as modules with extra structure. I would expect the user to care about the extra structure.
  Or short: compare everything that you can as long as it makes sense.
  Example:

```
sage: A = ZZ^2
sage: B = FreeQuadraticModule(ZZ,2,matrix.identity(2)*2)
sage: A == B
False
```
- Module equality should use ``echelonized_basis_matrix()`` where possible for example over Fields and ZZ. (I think over general PIDs the echelon for is not yet unique.)
I would expect it to be much faster for modules of large rank and it was used before. So if you want to change that, you have to prove that your implementation is consistently faster.
- if possible use 

```
from sage.structure.richcmp import richcmp_by_eq_and_lt
```
 this results in less lines of code. In particular the code is easier maintainable then.

```
if self.inner_product_matrix()==other.inner_product_matrix() and self.is_submodule(other):
    return True
else:
    return False 
```
but this is equivalent to the shorter 

```
a = self.inner_product_matrix()==other.inner_product_matrix()
b = self.is_submodule(other)
return a and b
```
Sry my pc at work is not really working at the moment.

Major rewrite.
Decided to abandon the `is_contained` method. 
Reason is that overwriting can result in "==" and other operators not being symmetric anymore.
Decided to use echelonized basis matrix for equality. My reason is that it is cached often anyways.

Following the discussion
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/DtpvPrwRi4s
I have moved the total ordering to a helper class `total_module_order`
Still needs some documentation.

Here are my comments:\n\n- `_total_order_cmp` is only a total order up to there being a total ordering on the base rings, which there is not. So the name is incorrect IMO.\n\n- We should not call this `cmp` because it does not behave like the `cmp` function as it does not return `-1,0,1`.\n\n- I understand the reasoning why you did the implementation of `total_module_order` the way you did; at least to me it seems like you are mimicking `cmp_to_key`. However, it feels over-engineered and is cumbersome to use IMO. I would rename `_total_order_cmp` to perhaps `_echelon_matrix_richcmp`. For the (currently) one case we use it as a key, that is when you use the `total_module_order` class, which should be called something like `EchelonMatrixKey`. Note that if we really do need to use this key/ordering, then there should be a mathematical reasoning behind this ordering, which would invalidate some of your reasoning.\n\n- You need to provide a deprecation warning to all users when using `<`,`<=`,`>`,`>=` saying the ordering on modules has changes as this is not a bug but a change in convention. This change will almost certainly break code in the wild.\n\n- It looks like you have removed the quick check for if `U.ambient_vector_space() == V`. This is a very quick check and a good optimization.\n\n- These changes are needed:\n\n  ```diff\n  -        ::\n  -            \n  +\n           We compare a one dimensional space to a two dimensional\n  -        space:\n  +        space::\n  ```\n\n  ```diff\n  -        ::\n  -        \n  +\n           We compare a `\\ZZ`-module to a one-dimensional\n  -        space.\n  +        space::\n  ```\n\n  ```diff\n  -\n  -        ::\n   \n           Comparison with a sub-module::\n  ```\n\nSome more minor comments:\n\n- `.. note::` -> `.. NOTE::`\n- Indentation errors in the doc for `total_module_order`.\n- Use <code>\\`\\`self\\`\\`</code> in the docstrings.\n- Did you move `echelonized_basis_matrix` or is that a by-product of how git does the diff? Anyways, it might create merge conflicts by how the changes are done, so it is better to keep things in the order they are. Also remove the added bunch of blank lines after; they make the file less consistent.\n- PEP8 says put a space on both sides of relations, e.g., `!=`.\n- Remove trailing whitespace.",

- We should not call this `cmp` because it does not behave like the `cmp` function as it does not return `-1,0,1`.

- I understand the reasoning why you did the implementation of `total_module_order` the way you did; at least to me it seems like you are mimicking `cmp_to_key`. However, it feels over-engineered and is cumbersome to use IMO. I would rename `_total_order_cmp` to perhaps `_echelon_matrix_richcmp`. For the (currently) one case we use it as a key, that is when you use the `total_module_order` class, which should be called something like `EchelonMatrixKey`. Note that if we really do need to use this key/ordering, then there should be a mathematical reasoning behind this ordering, which would invalidate some of your reasoning.

- You need to provide a deprecation warning to all users when using `<`,`<=`,`>`,`>=` saying the ordering on modules has changes as this is not a bug but a change in convention. This change will almost certainly break code in the wild.

- It looks like you have removed the quick check for if `U.ambient_vector_space() == V`. This is a very quick check and a good optimization.

- These changes are needed:

  ```diff
  -        ::
  -            
  +
           We compare a one dimensional space to a two dimensional
  -        space:
  +        space::
  ```

  ```diff
  -        ::
  -        
  +
           We compare a `\ZZ`-module to a one-dimensional
  -        space.
  +        space::
  ```

  ```diff
  -
  -        ::
   
           Comparison with a sub-module::
  ```

Some more minor comments:

- `.. note::` -> `.. NOTE::`
- Indentation errors in the doc for `total_module_order`.
- Use <code>\`\`self\`\`</code> in the docstrings.
- Did you move `echelonized_basis_matrix` or is that a by-product of how git does the diff? Anyways, it might create merge conflicts by how the changes are done, so it is better to keep things in the order they are. Also remove the added bunch of blank lines after; they make the file less consistent.
- PEP8 says put a space on both sides of relations, e.g., `!=`.
- Remove trailing whitespace.

It seems the reason is for testing purposes. See
​https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/DtpvPrwRi4s

> - It looks like you have removed the quick check for if `U.ambient_vector_space() == V`. This is a very quick check and a good optimization.

I suppose you are referring to

```
-        try:
-            if self.ambient_vector_space() != other.ambient_vector_space():
-                return False
-            if other == other.ambient_vector_space():
-                return True
-        except AttributeError:
-            # Not all free modules have an ambient_vector_space.
-            pass
```
I expect this code block only speeds up comparison if

```
self.ambient_vector_space() is other.ambient_vector_space() and
other is other.ambient_vector_space()
```
and else slows it down a bit as then it is checking baserings ranks degrees etc. twice.
How about:

```
        try:
            # optimization for ambient spaces
            if (self.ambient_vector_space() is other.ambient_vector_space() and 
               other is other.ambient_vector_space()):
               return True
        except AttributeError:
            # Not all free modules have an ambient_vector_space.
            pass
```

I have reverted back to the old behavior of `is_submodule` as removing the above "optimization" changes the behavior, and this ticket already touches enough already.

I also moved around some tests, removed duplicate ones, did some general cleanup and simplification, and found a very annoying bug with `_eq` that came about because of non-unique parents and that `self.base_ring() is IntegerRing` is never going to be true because the RHS is a type, not an instance.

I believe if my changes are good, then positive review (i.e., over the time I was looking at this, I might have forgotten one of my needs-to-be-done-before-positive-review notes; please check).
