In `src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_ring_generic.pyx`, the method `completion()` constructs a `PowerSeriesRing` either from variable names or from an polynomial ring element. The latter must be changed for #10483. Moreover, the error checking also needs to be improved.

I ask because it feels like we should pass `names` off to `normalize_names`, which will then support that semantic. Is there a reason why you are not using that?

Also, could we add the `@rename_keyword(deprecation=23377, p='names')` in order to avoid backwards incompatible changes (just in case someone in the wild is explicitly doing `R.completion(p='x')`)?

Python should really invent syntax for positional-only arguments. They have keyword-only arguments now in Python 3, but why not positional-only arguments? My favourite consequence:

```
sage: R.<self,other> = QQ[[]]
sage: a = R.random_element(); a
-3/4*self^4 + 12*self^5*other - 3/2*self^4*other^3 + self^3*other^7 + 1/2*self^6*other^5 + O(self, other)^12
sage: a(self=1)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-6b78fae4891c> in <module>()
----> 1 a(self=Integer(1))

TypeError: __call__() got multiple values for keyword argument 'self'
```

Anyway... I'll add the deprecation since you asked.

Python does have a way for positional only arguments. You just have to do `foo(self, *args, **kwds)` and manually handle keywords. However, that is indeed a fun examples.

Yes, that works but it's not a very satisfactory solution...

There is a different here for `names` than the `PolynomialRing` constructor for example: the `names` are not arbitrary names, they refer to an element of `self`. The fact that we actually allow to give an element, not just a string, is another example of that.

I would argue that giving an element is actually recommend, because it makes sense mathematically: you have a ring and you are completing it w.r.t. a given element from that ring.

For me, the main reason to allow strings is to allow the `C.<...> = R.completion()` syntax.
