In #23227 we added `cpdef` declarations to address most of https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1732.  A few were not completely straightforward and will be dealt with in follow-up tickets:

1. `sage/algebras/quatalg/quaternion_algebra_element.pxd`: #24607

2. `sage/modular/pollack_stevens`: #23603

3. `sage/modules`: #24607

4. `sage/numerical/backends`: #20324

5. `sage/rings/finite_rings`: #24116 and #24607

6. `sage/rings/number_field`: #23603

7. `sage/rings/padics`: #27417, #24609

8. `sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pxd`: #23606

9. `sage/rings/power_series_*`: #24607 and #24608

Comments in more detail:

1. `sage/algebras/quatalg`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

2. `sage/modular/pollack_stevens`: unrelated change to `cpdef normalize`

3. `src/sage/modules`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

4. `sage/numerical/backends`: `add_variable` is already declared in the base class `GenericBackend`

5. `sage/rings/finite_rings`: instead, add abstract methods `_add_` and `_mul_` to the base class.

6. `src/sage/rings/number_field`: already in the base class `NumberFieldElement` (but not declared there)

7. `sage/rings/padics`: lots of changes, not looked in detail yet.

8. `src/sage/rings/polynomial` and power series: instead, add abstract methods to the base class.
