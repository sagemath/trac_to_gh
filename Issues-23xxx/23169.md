Just like `.factor` can call `._factor_univariate_polynomial`, `.is_squarefree` should be able to call `._is_squarefree_univariate_polynomial`.

Some background: In #22956 I am introducing complete rings with lazy elements. For some polynomials over these rings, arithmetic is almost impossible, in particular `gcd` can not be computed (in theory they could but it would be unfeasible). At the same time, it is trivial to decide squarefreeness in that case, so I need a hook into the `is_squarefree()` method.
