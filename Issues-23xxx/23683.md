Really, `some_elements()` is designed primarily for testing rather than to tell the user something. So having smaller number of `some_elements()`, but having those elements be "interesting" (in an appropriate definition), is what I think it should be.

Ok. Cool.

Could you elaborate or maybe rather comment on the followup ticket?

Minor typo: `# long timeA (10s)`; you can set a positive review once fixed.

I believe David (Roe) will post the followup ticket with perhaps more details and/or a first implementation. What we agreed upon was basically the following:

- if `some_elements()^N > max_runs` and something like `max_samples` or `sampling=True` was passed:
  * do sampling
- else:
  * use the direct iterator

As far as sampling goes, in order to do "good" sampling, we would need to decide upon a convention for where in `some_elements` the more "interesting" objects are at the end and we sample more heavily from there.

Something that I have used the `TestSuite` for is to increase the `max_runs` and fix failures as more interesting elements come up. So I needed that to behave in a more deterministic way as with sampling, it could be nice for `N` but fail for `N-1` because of the elements used. I also like it to work for infinite (enumerated) sets as well.
