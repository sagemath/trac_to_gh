Followup to #23193.

Function field doctests take 10 minutes on reasonable machines. That's way too much. The changes introduced here drop this again to 7/70 seconds for the doctests/long doctests.

Say you want 4 relatively trivial elements and 1 very complicated element in order to test interesting examples but it is too slow otherwise (perhaps in reality it would be 2x or 3x these particular numbers). It is very likely that you would sample only the trivial elements, but you would have no idea that those were the ones sampled, much less have any clear (or even feasible) way to change that. If you want to sample elements, then *you* sample the elements and pass them to the `TestSuite`. However, you have to do that for every such test, so the best solution is to make `some_elements` smaller and instead pass `elements` with more complicated elements for those other more fundamental tests.",

Because then you have fundamentally no control over the elements that are chosen and it can defeat the entire purpose of having a few interesting elements. Say you want 4 relatively trivial elements and 1 very complicated element in order to test interesting examples but it is too slow otherwise (perhaps in reality it would be 2x or 3x these particular numbers). It is very likely that you would sample only the trivial elements, but you would have no idea that those were the ones sampled, much less have any clear (or even feasible) way to change that. If you want to sample elements, then *you* sample the elements and pass them to the `TestSuite`. However, you have to do that for every such test, so the best solution is to make `some_elements` smaller and instead pass `elements` with more complicated elements for those other more fundamental tests.

I've been talking with David at Days 88 about this, and I realized that I wasn't clear that I am not opposed to the current branch as a short-term solution. Julian, if you could update the timings, I will set a positive review.

Also, David and I discussed implementing a sampling feature to the `TestSuite` that would not be run by default, but by passing another argument to `TestSuite` that would only be used when the number of elements was bigger than `max_runs`.

Minor typo: `# long timeA (10s)`; you can set a positive review once fixed.

> > Also, David and I discussed implementing a sampling feature to the `TestSuite` that would not be run by default, but by passing another argument to `TestSuite` that would only be used when the number of elements was bigger than `max_runs`.

> Could you elaborate or maybe rather comment on the followup ticket?

I believe David (Roe) will post the followup ticket with perhaps more details and/or a first implementation. What we agreed upon was basically the following:

- if `some_elements()^N > max_runs` and something like `max_samples` or `sampling=True` was passed:
  * do sampling
- else:
  * use the direct iterator

As far as sampling goes, in order to do "good" sampling, we would need to decide upon a convention for where in `some_elements` the more "interesting" objects are at the end and we sample more heavily from there.

Something that I have used the `TestSuite` for is to increase the `max_runs` and fix failures as more interesting elements come up. So I needed that to behave in a more deterministic way as with sampling, it could be nice for `N` but fail for `N-1` because of the elements used. I also like it to work for infinite (enumerated) sets as well.
