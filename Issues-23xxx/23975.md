Sometimes the following happens:

```

In this case, the `.pyc` file indeed does not exist:

```

```

It seems that the `.pyc` files are intentionally deleted by `sage-location`. I see no reason for this.

It's not random. Typically, it happens when you are building the documentation and at the same time installing some package.

So, on terminal 1, we run

```
$ make doc
```

And on terminal 2, we run something like

```
$ make database_cremona_ellcurve   # or any other optional package
$ ./sage
```

Starting `./sage` on terminal 2 will cause `sage-location` to run, which will in turn cause the docbuild to fail in terminal 1.

Interestingly, in the very first version of `sage-location` (commit c7e6c5d1c1db3b8562c07e83ff6c36bbb7d36c24), removing the `.pyc` and `.pyo` files was the only thing that `sage-location` did. This is the main function from that 11-year old version:

```python
def update_hardcoded_files(path):
    # The only known files with hard coded paths.
    if os.path.isdir(path):
        for X in os.listdir(path):
            update_hardcoded_files('%s/%s'%(path,X))
    else:
        P = path[-4:]
        if P == '.pyo' or P == '.pyc':
            try:
                os.unlink(path)
            except OSError, msg:
                print msg
```
So I guess they must be deleted because there are hardcoded paths in those files. If so, that is clearly no longer relevant.

pyc files contain hard-coded paths :/  Better than deleting them would be immediately regenerating them though.
