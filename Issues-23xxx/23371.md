```
sage: foo = Sequence([], universe=ZZ)
sage: foo += [1/2]
sage: foo, foo.universe(), foo[0].parent()
([1/2], Integer Ring, Rational Field)
```

The solution is probably to override some additional functions in `sage.structure.sequence.Sequence_generic`, which inherits from `list`.

Component: **coercion**
