Adds methods `immediate_dominators` and `strong_articulation_points` for directed graphs.
* The `immediate_dominators` is essentially the same as the NetworkX method. I tried to implement more recent algorithms [1], but the running times were not so good.
* The `strong_articulation_points` is as presented in [2].

I let the `strong_bridges` method for another ticket.

Quick comments:

- Use `r` instead of `root` in the doc as it gives better latex.
- No period (full stop) at the end here:

  ```
        - ``root`` -- a vertex of the digraph, the root of the
          immediate dominators tree.
  ```
- ~if not root in self:` to ` if root not in self:`.
- Stylistic, but I prefer `SAP = []` to `SAP = list()` as it is shorter (and IMO, cleaner)
- How difficult would it be to modify `immediate_dominators` to have an argument to handle the reversed case? This would make it so you do not have to construct the reversed `DiGraph`, which could be very costly in terms of time/memory. At least, this seems like it would be straightforward to do.

I will give more detailed comments later.

Thank you for your comments. 

To handle the reversed case in `immediate_dominators`, we need a reversed (or backward) depth first search. This is currently implemented only for the `c_graph` backend.
What I can do is to check in `immediate_dominators` if the backend is `c_graph` and raise an error if it is not the case and the reverse parameter is True. Then, in the `strong_articulation_points` method, I can make a copy of the digraph using the `c_graph` backend if self uses a different backend.
I will also have to check the backend used in `strongly_connected_component_subgraphs`.

Do you have other suggestions?

Since I have to take care of 1) immutable graphs and 2) that I should not modify the input graph (I'm currently removing/adding edges to test if `r` is a SAP, I must:
- if the input graph is strongly connected: make a mutable copy, preferably using a backend with the reverse DFS option
- for each strongly connected component, get a mutable subgraph, preferably using the good backend

Then in method `immediate_dominators`, I could add a parameter `reverse` that could be used only if the backend has the desirable method (otherwise raise an error).

do you have other suggestions before I start modifying the code?
