I am not sure to understand what you mean exactly.

0) if you want to see the current state of affairs, you can use the branch "public/python3-experiment-v1" together with "export SAGE_PYTHON3=yes". Of course, this implies a very long compilation. 

1) see my last message here : https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/sage-devel/python3%7Csort:relevance/sage-devel/TOrSXDutNvA/OnGDFvx6AgAJ

So if anybody wants to help, tackling the hard #22875 would be a way. Another one would be to convert all the pexpect interfaces to use unicode. A third one would be to update cypari2 (#23518), etc, etc

**EDIT:**

or handle #23648

or convert "src/sage/combinat/words/abstract_word.py" to use richcmp instead of cmp()

I don't follow sage-devel, so I didn't know what the state of things was, I just have generically heard 'we need to convert things to Python 3'.

Most of this seems beyond what I'm capable of, but I might try and look at `abstract_word.py` and see if I can correct things using this ticket as a model.
