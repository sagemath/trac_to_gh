We implement a function `wrapperdescr_call` to call slot wrappers without type checking. This is useful for arithmetic slots like `__mul__` where *either* the first or second argument must be of the expected type (unlike usually in Python, where the first argument is `self` and must be of the expected type).

I decided to create a new top-level directory `src/sage/cpython` for this. We already have several other modules/functions in Sage which would also fit there (but moving those is outside the scope of this ticket).
