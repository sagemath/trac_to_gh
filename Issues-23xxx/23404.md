We implement a function `wrapperdescr_call` to call slot wrappers without type checking. This is useful for arithmetic slots like `__mul__` where *either* the first or second argument must be of the expected type (unlike usually in Python, where the first argument is `self` and must be of the expected type).

I decided to create a new top-level directory `src/sage/cpython` for this. We already have several other modules/functions in Sage which would also fit there (but moving those is outside the scope of this ticket).

LGTM modulo change "wrongly" to "incorrectly" (somewhat bikeshedding, but it sounds awkward to me). You can set a positive review on my behalf.
