This ticket implements **multivector fields** (i.e. alternating contravariant tensor fields) on differentiable manifolds, via the parent classes 

- `MultivectorModule`: set *A<sup>p</sup>(M)* of multivector fields of a degree *p* on a manifold *M*, considered as a module over the commutative algebra *C<sup>k</sup>(M)* of differentiable scalar fields
- `MultivectorFreeModule`: set *A<sup>p</sup>(M)* of multivector fields of a degree *p* on a *parallelizable* manifold *M*, considered as a *free* module of rank binomial(*n,p*) over *C<sup>k</sup>(M)* (where *n*=dim*M*)

and the element classes

- `MultivectorField`: multivector field on a differentiable manifold
- `MultivectorFieldParal`: multivector field on a parallelizable differentiable manifold

The classes `MultivectorFreeModule` and `MultivectorFieldParal` inherit from respectively `ExtPowerFreeModule` and `AlternatingContrTensor`, which have been introduced in #23207.

The classes `VectorField` and `VectorFieldParal` inherit now from the new classes `MultivectorField` and `MultivectorFieldParal`, since a vector field is a multivector field of degree 1. 

The ticket implements the **exterior product** *A<sup>p</sup>(M)* x *A<sup>q</sup>(M)* ---> *A<sup>p+q</sup>(M)* (method `wedge`), as well as the **interior products**
- *A<sup>p</sup>(M)* x Omega*<sup>q</sup>(M)* ---> Omega*<sup>q-p</sup>(M)*
- Omega*<sup>p</sup>(M)* x *A<sup>q</sup>(M)* ---> *A<sup>q-p</sup>(M)*
for *p<=q*, where Omega*<sup>p</sup>(M)* is the *C<sup>k</sup>(M)*-module of differential forms of degree *p* on *M* (method `interior_product`).
The ticket also implements the **Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket** *A<sup>p</sup>(M)*x*A<sup>q</sup>(M)* ---> *A<sup>p+q-1</sup>(M)* (method `bracket`), extending the Lie bracket of vector fields.

This is a follow up of #23207 within the [SageManifolds project](http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/) (see the metaticket #18528 for an overview).

<a id='comment:6'></a>A few minor comments:

Typo (appears twice):

```
- ``other`` -- a multivector field, `b` say
```

No comma here:

```
- ``other`` -- a multivector field, of degree `p`
```

Could you remove a few of these extra blanklines:

```diff
+    The Lie derivative of a 2-vector field is a 2-vector field::
+
+        sage: ab.lie_der(a)
+        2-vector field on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R3
+
+
+
+    """
+    def __init__(self, vector_field_module, degree, name=None,
+                 latex_name=None):
```

It is a little easier to read

```diff
-       resu_name = None ; resu_latex_name = None
+       resu_name = None
+       resu_latex_name = None
```

Do you need to use Sage's `Set`? It is quite a bit slower than the Python `set`.

For things like this:

```python
                resu._restrictions[dom] = \
                                     dom.tensor_field_module((p,0))(rst)
```
it is better on 1 line and go over the 80 char/line for maintenance and readability. This is more a judgment call about the lesser of two evils.

I am pretty sure you can use:

```
sage: import itertools
sage: list(itertools.combinations([1,2,3], 2))
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
```
to iterate over all subsets of a fixed size. (There is also `from sage.misc.misc import powerset` for an iterator over all subsets.) I don't even think you need to convert the subsets, which are tuples, to Python `set`s.
