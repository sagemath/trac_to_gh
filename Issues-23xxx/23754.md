This is an example of randomized testing of finite lattices. Main idea is to check functions against other: A distributive lattice must be modular, an atom of a lattice must be a coatom of the dual lattice and so on.

You should put `implications`, `*_properties`, etc. at the module level in case another test file wants to have access them, IMO it is cleaner, and is (marginally) faster.

Use `.. TODO::`.

Also, why do you need to add those lines for the testing? I think those should not be there and instead the test function should be modified accordingly.

Sorry Travis, I think I did not understood.

What is "module level" in this case? At the root level of `src/sage/tests/finite_poset.py` so that importing the module would import them to the global namespace?

What lines you refer in the last paragraph? If you mean `T.is_doubling_any = lambda L: L.is_constructible_by_doublings('any')` etc, then I suggest that I make a helper function for those first. Otherwise the code would be unnecessary complex, as `attrcall('is_'+p)` is currently quite clean solution.

In Python: `module == file`. So putting something at the module level means putting it at the base level of the test file. This would also not add anything to the global namespace (in case you're worried).

> What lines you refer in the last paragraph? If you mean `T.is_doubling_any = lambda L: L.is_constructible_by_doublings('any')` etc, then I suggest that I make a helper function for those first.

Yes, those are the lines I'm talking about. The code that you need to actually run the test is very ugly (and essentially undocumented). I would instead have a helper function that replaces `attrcall` with this:

```python
def test_attrcall(name, L):
    if name == 'is_doubling_any':
        return L.is_constructible_by_doublings('any')
    if name == 'is_doubling_lower:
        return L.is_constructible_by_doublings('upper')
    if name == 'is_doubling_upper':
        return L.is_constructible_by_doublings('lower')
    if name == 'is_doubling_convex':
        return L.is_constructible_by_doublings('convex')
    if name == 'is_doubling_interval':
        return L.is_constructible_by_doublings('interval')
    if name == 'is_uniq_orthocomplemented':
        return L.is_orthocomplemented(unique=True)
    return attrcall(name)(L)
```
This way it is clean because you do not need to change your objects and the code is localized to this file.

Yes, but I want all of those declarations to be *outside* the function (i.e., everything up to `### Relations between boolean-valued properties ###` except for the cardinality test).

You can remove this line:

```
This needs few lines before the test, see example below.
```
It might be good to also add to the doc a short overview list of the things that are tested, e.g.,

```
- implications of properties
- mutually exclusive properties
- (self)dual properties
- inclusions of subsets
```
Also, small typo:

```diff
-.. TODO:
+.. TODO::
```

Two last things:

```diff
    The function contains tests of different kinds:
+
    - Implications of boolean properties. Examples: a distributive lattice is modular,
```
and if you could move the `test_getattr` outside the main test function (and add a short one-line description with a doctest testing the modified path and the `getattr` path).
