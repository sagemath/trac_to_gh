```
When computing `symbolic_expression ** something_else`, the result could also live in a common parent of the respective parents, and not necessarily in `SR`. Example, we want:

```
sage: A.<n> = AsymptoticRing('SR^n * n^SR', SR)
sage: SR(2)^n
2^n
```

Currently, this code yields

```
sage: SR(2)^n
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: no canonical coercion from Asymptotic Ring <SR^n * n^SR> over Symbolic Ring to Symbolic Ring
```
