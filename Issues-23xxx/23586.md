Whenever IPython prints a dict or set, it tries to sort the keys for a nicer output. If the sorting fails, then no sorting is done.

This ticket proposes instead to sort on the string representation if the usual sorting fails. That way, we almost certainly get a deterministic output, which is mainly useful for doctests.

It must be said that sorting rarely fails on Python 2, so this would affect mostly Python 3.

Those bots do not have `pynormaliz` installed, that means nothing...

On my bots I try to install all optional packages, so `sage4` and `arando` should have it.

    "body": "<div id=\"comment:15\" align=\"right\">comment:15</div>\n\nI looked a bit into this, and from reading the sage and IPython code I currently understand how the printing of sets is handled is currently via the pretty printing of IPython. And this pretty printing of ipython already sorts items before printing (although on their actual value and not their string representation). \n\nI just verified this experimentally:\n\n```\nsage: str(set([13^i for i in  range(10,1,-1)]))\n'set([815730721, 62748517, 137858491849, 10604499373, 28561, 2197, 169, 4826809, 371293])'\nsage: set([13^i for i in  range(10,1,-1)])\n{169,\n 2197,\n 28561,\n 371293,\n 4826809,\n 62748517,\n 815730721,\n 10604499373,\n 137858491849}\n```\n\nSo the question is wether we want to change this sorting on `__cmp__` to a sorting on str (or on pretty). \n\nThe current sorting behaviour is ok with respect to the doctest for sets containing objects that have a meaningful `__cmp__` method. However the default fallback for `__cmp__` is comparing objects by their id which is really random.

I looked a bit into this, and from reading the sage and IPython code I currently understand how the printing of sets is handled is currently via the pretty printing of IPython. And this pretty printing of ipython already sorts items before printing (although on their actual value and not their string representation). 

I just verified this experimentally:

```
sage: str(set([13^i for i in  range(10,1,-1)]))
'set([815730721, 62748517, 137858491849, 10604499373, 28561, 2197, 169, 4826809, 371293])'
sage: set([13^i for i in  range(10,1,-1)])
{169,
 2197,
 28561,
 371293,
 4826809,
 62748517,
 815730721,
 10604499373,
 137858491849}
```

So the question is wether we want to change this sorting on `__cmp__` to a sorting on str (or on pretty). 

The current sorting behaviour is ok with respect to the doctest for sets containing objects that have a meaningful `__cmp__` method. However the default fallback for `__cmp__` is comparing objects by their id which is really random. So although the IPython pretty printing is more robust then the standard printing, it is not really robust in general.

The following current printing behaviour is convincing enough for me that we should still change. 

```
sage: set(GF(13)).union(GF(11))
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
sage: 
sage: set(GF(11)).union(GF(13))
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

After restarting sage:

```
sage: set(GF(11)).union(GF(13))
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
```

I implemented the sorting by str option. Although there are some things I didn't do yet:

- Document the newly written code
- Adapt the doctests to accommodate the new way of printing
- Apply this also to the printing of the builtin Set of sage

The main reason is that I am not 100% sure ye that this is the way to fix this ticket. This way of fixing this ticket namely also means that we now have

```
sage: set(GF(11))
{0, 1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```

instead of

```
sage: set(GF(11))
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

And this looks ugly to me.

We could make the order of the printing depend on wether we are currently doctesting, so that the end user is not bothered by the ugly output.

Or should we adjust the way we sort the output according to str?

If we do want to sort for str, then there is another choice to be made. Do we want to do this both for user output or just for doctesting. Doing this for user output as well, will give the user less meaningful and more ugly looking output. So the question is whether nice user output outweighs the good practice of output order in doctests and user output being the same. I personally think this is ok since sets are inherently unordered, but am open for other opinions.

> After a little more thought, having the default comparison is probably best. If something needs special handling because objects are not comparable, then I think deserves to manually have a `sorted(foo, key=str)` for the doctest. Another option would be if their is an error caught by ipython, then default to `key=str`.

In the current failing doctest IPython is not catching any errors so I don't see how the other option would help.

p.s. Slightly offtopic, thinking about the subtleties in this ticket I really start to dislike how the coercion framework, `__eq__` and hash interact. There seems to be something inherently contradictory in the assumptions of these three primitives, leading to things like

```
sage: set(srange(5)).union(GF(3)).union(GF(5))
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
sage: set(GF(3)).union(GF(5)).union(srange(5))
{0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
```

Hi, Jeroen.

You are right that comparing arbitrary objects and hence sorting of hetrogenous collections is not allowed anymore. But I think this will actually make the situation worse, since one is still allowed to make heterogenous sets like set([object(),"a",1]). IPython doesn't sort the sets where sorting raises a TypeError, so for these sets it will just print them in the order that python iterates over them, which (I admittedly didn't check) I suspect to be nondeterministic.

However as mentioned by Travis in comment 22, we can catch this error and just use sorting by string if normal sorting fails. I think this is a clean solution, so we could also just fix it for python 3 and leave the python 2 behaviour as is.
