This is a proposal for changing Sage's build behavior: if `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, then build for both Python 2 and Python 3. This will increase the build time and the required disk space, but then at runtime, you can choose which version of Sage to run.

I also propose that we introduce a new shell command "sage3" which runs Sage using Python 3.

After Sage builds with Python 3, we can change the default to `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`, so more people can test this. A while after that, we can stop supporting Python 2 altogether.

There is a different approach to solve the same problem in #23129, and I think the plan is to merge that early in 8.1, to give it lots of time for testing.

So, does this ticket depend on #23039 or not?

`pynac` produce only one usable library with soname `libpynac.so.x.y`. It is not versioned for python, meaning that even if you build it twice, you get the same library again. It will just be linked to a different python after rebuild (and since some internals depend on the python version, you cannot just underlink to provide whichever python when you link against pynac).

Further, as far as I can tell, and I tried, there is no way to introduce the python implementation as a variable in the library name in libtool. It just doesn't work. In sage-on-gentoo I
* make a copy of the source for each version of python
* patch Makfeile.am in each copy to replace `libpynac.la` by `libpynac_pythonX_Y.la`
* rerun autoconf in each copy
* build and install each copy which now install `libpynac_pythonX_Y.so`
* Finally patch sage to get the right pynac library depending on the python I build for.
Luckily the header are independent of the python implementation, otherwise it would be even more tricky.

Given that sage doesn't ship autotools by default, if you want to reproduce that setup you need to re-create one tarball by version of python.

The same discussion happened in https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!searchin/sage-devel/Pynac$20python%7Csort:date/sage-devel/IY8rc3i-sh4/-MfB1OvkBQAJ

Nils Bruin: "But then we need to either build libraries libpynac2 and libpynac3 or put libpynac somewhere in local/lib/python*".

What's wrong with building Pynac twice?
