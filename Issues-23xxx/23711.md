So we really need to know the exact matplotlib version number in `sage-env`?

```sh
# Use a matplotlib config directory specific to Sage and specific to
# the version number of matplotlib, by setting the environment
# variable MPLCONFIGDIR. Note that we can't find the version number by
# importing matplotlib, because that could create matplotlib's standard
# config directory. So we use pkg_resources.
"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version' 2>/dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    MPLVERSION=`"$SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python" -c 'import pkg_resources; print (pkg_resources.get_distribution("matplotlib").version)'`
    MPLCONFIGDIR="$DOT_SAGE/matplotlib-$MPLVERSION"
    export MPLCONFIGDIR
    # The directory is created when Sage starts (see sage.misc.misc).
fi
```

Instead, we could just hardcode a version number, analogous to what we do for Jupyter:

```sh
if [ -z "$IPYTHONDIR" ]; then
    # We hardcode a version number in the directory name. The idea is
    # that we keep using the same version number as long as that is
    # possible. Only when some future IPython version really requires
    # a new structure for the $IPYTHONDIR should this version number be
    # changed to the new IPython version.
    export IPYTHONDIR="$DOT_SAGE/ipython-5.0.0"
fi

if [ -z "$JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR" ]; then
    # We hardcode a version number in the directory name. The idea is
    # that we keep using the same version number as long as that is
    # possible. Only when some future Jupyter version really requires
    # a new structure for the $JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR should this version
    # number be changed to the new jupyter_core version.
    export JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR="$DOT_SAGE/jupyter-4.1"
fi
```

I think this makes sense to me, especially since we're already doing the same for Jupyter.

I'd still like a more general approach like I suggested above, but that can happen separately since this will give speedup times to sage startup now.

I'm not convinced to use #22652 to change the directory every time. Usually, it is considered a feature that a configuration directory remains in the same place.

That was the reason for hardcoding the Jupyter directories: I have some custom configuration and it's not fun if you need to copy it every time that Jupyter is upgraded in Sage.

That's exactly what we *do not* want to do. It's a misfeature to have configuration directories depend on a version number.

Jeroen's point is that it's *not* the same number.  The number in the config directory name is the *last* version at which the format of the configuration for that package changed in a significantly-enough backwards-incompatible way that a new configuration is needed.

For example "jupyter-1.5.0" means "configuration for jupyter-1.5.0 and above".  If jupyter 3.0 comes along and changes the layout of its config directory then we add "jupyter-3.0" for config of jupyter 3.0 and above.

This is as opposed to updating the config dir every time a package is updated (especially onerous when we're talking micro version updates that only contain bug fixes).  The config dirs do not track one-to-one with the version of the package.

This is called madness in my book. I would understand these directory names being independent of the minor version, but having in `~/.sage/blah-1.1.1` configuration for `blah-2.3.4` is crazy.
