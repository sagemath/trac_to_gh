is replaced by 

```

I agree that an example is a good idea, but I couldn't find one originally!

Thanks to some hints from Tim Dokchitser I have now added an example that failed previous to this change:
The issue was with complex entries in gammaV which occur for L-functions of maass forms for example http://www.lmfdb.org/L/ModularForm/GL2/Q/Maass/4f4bf1c388aece438d000000/ , the lack of abs caused the cflength function to crash when it tried to check an inequality with a complex number.
