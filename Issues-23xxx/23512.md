The version of Tim Dokchitser's computel script is older than the one on his website.
This ticket updates to the latest version.

The only change is the fix of an inequality.

Keywords: **sd87, dokchister**

I agree that an example is a good idea, but I couldn't find one originally!

Thanks to some hints from Tim Dokchitser I have now added an example that failed previous to this change:
The issue was with complex entries in gammaV which occur for L-functions of maass forms for example http://www.lmfdb.org/L/ModularForm/GL2/Q/Maass/4f4bf1c388aece438d000000/ , the lack of abs caused the cflength function to crash when it tried to check an inequality with a complex number.
