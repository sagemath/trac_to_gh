The code of `matching_polynomial` has a hidden bug when the graph has zero edges: in this block of code

```
    edges = <int **>malloc(2 * nedges * sizeof(int *))
[...]
    edges1 = edges[0]
    edges2 = edges[1]
```
we access the first 2 elements of a 0-length array. Due to the way how `malloc()` works, this usually doesn't crash. But with `check_allocarray` from `cysignals`, it does crash.

This is easily fixed by avoiding accessing `edges[0]` and `edges[1]`.
