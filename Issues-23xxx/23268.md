It is encoded by a lattice in a huge\n   vector space whose dimension is the number of elements having this\n   parent.\n\n   Concretely, this precision datum is an instance of the class\n   \"sage.rings.padic.lattice_precision.PrecisionLattice\". It is\n   attached to the parent and is created at the same time as the\n   parent. (It is actually a bit more subtle because two different\n   parents may share the same instance; this happens for instance for\n   a p-adic ring and its field of fractions.)\n\n   This precision datum is accessible through the method\n   \"precision()\":\n\n      sage: R = ZpLP(5, print_mode='terse')\n      sage: prec = R.precision()\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 0 object\n\n   This instance knows about all elements of the parent, it is\n   automatically updated when a new element (of this parent) is\n   created:\n\n      sage: x = R(3513,10)\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 1 object\n      sage: y = R(176,5)\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 2 objects\n      sage: z = R.random_element()\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 3 objects\n\n   The method \"tracked_elements()\" provides the list of all tracked\n   elements:\n\n      sage: prec.tracked_elements()\n      [3513 + O(5^10), 176 + O(5^5), ...]\n\n   Similarly, when a variable is collected by the garbage collector,\n   the precision lattice is updated. Note however that the update\n   might be delayed. We can force it with the method \"del_elements()\":\n\n      sage: z = 0\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 3 objects\n      sage: prec.del_elements()\n      sage: prec\n      Precision Lattice on 2 objects\n\n   The method \"precision_lattice()\" returns (a matrix defining) the\n   lattice that models the precision. Here we have:\n\n      sage: prec.precision_lattice()\n      [9765625       0]\n      [      0    3125]\n\n   Observe that 5^10 = 9765625 and 5^5 = 3125. The above matrix then\n   reflects the precision on x and y.\n\n   Now, observe how the precision lattice changes while performing\n   computations:\n\n      sage: x, y = 3*x+2*y, 2*(x-y)\n      sage: prec.del_elements()\n      sage: prec.precision_lattice()\n      [    3125 48825000]\n      [       0 48828125]\n\n   The matrix we get is no longer diagonal, meaning that some digits\n   of precision are diffused among the two new elements x and y. They\n   nevertheless show up when we compute for instance x+y:\n\n      sage: x\n      1516 + O(5^5)\n      sage: y\n      424 + O(5^5)\n      sage: x+y\n      17565 + O(5^11)\n\n   It is these diffused digits of precision (which are tracked but do\n   not appear on the printing) that allow to be always sharp on\n   precision.\n\n   PERFORMANCES:\n\n   Each elementary operation requires significant manipulations on the\n   lattice precision and then is costly. Precisely:\n\n   * The creation of a new element has a cost O(n) when n is the\n     number of tracked elements.\n\n   * The destruction of one element has a cost O(m^2) when m is the\n     distance between the destroyed element and the last one.\n     Fortunately, it seems that m tends to be small in general (the\n     dynamics of the list of tracked elements is rather close to that\n     of a stack).\n\n   It is nevertheless still possible to manipulate several hundred\n   variables (e.g. squares matrices of size 5 or polynomials of degree\n   20 are accessible).\n\n   The class \"PrecisionLattice\" provides several features for\n   introspection (especially concerning timings). If enables, it\n   maintains an history of all actions and stores the wall time of\n   each of them:\n\n      sage: R = ZpLP(3)\n      sage: prec = R.precision()\n      sage: prec.history_enable()\n      sage: M = random_matrix(R, 5)\n      sage: d = M.determinant()\n      sage: print prec.history()  # somewhat random\n         ---\n      0.004212s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000003s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~\n      0.000010s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.001560s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000004s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~oooo~oooo~o\n      0.002168s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.001787s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000004s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~o\n      0.000198s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.001152s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000005s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~oooo~~o\n      0.000853s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000610s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      ...\n      0.003879s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000006s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~~~~\n      0.000036s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.006737s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000005s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~~~~ooooo\n      0.002637s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.007118s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000008s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~~~o~~~~oooo\n      0.003504s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.005371s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000006s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~~o~~~ooo\n      0.001858s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.003584s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000004s  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~o~~oo\n      0.000801s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.001916s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000022s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~oooo~o~o\n      0.014705s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.001292s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n      0.000002s  ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo~o\n\n   The symbol o symbolized a tracked element.

In several recent papers, David Roe, Tristan Vaccon and I explain that lattices allow a sharp track of precision: if f is a function we want to evaluate and x is an input given with some uncertainty modeled by a lattice H, then the uncertainty on the output f(x) is exactly df_x(H).

For much more details, I refer to my lecture notes http://xavier.toonywood.org/papers/publis/course-padic.pdf

The aim of this ticket is to propose a rough implementation of these ideas. 

You can play with the latest version of this by clicking on launch binder [here](https://github.com/saraedum/sage-binder-env/tree/t-23505-lattice-precision).

Below is a small demo (extracted from the doctest).

```

   Below is a small demo of the features by this model of precision:

      sage: R = ZpLP(3, print_mode='terse')
      sage: x = R(1,10)

   Of course, when we multiply by 3, we gain one digit of absolute
   precision:

      sage: 3*x
      3 + O(3^11)

   The lattice precision machinery sees this even if we decompose the
   computation into several steps:

      sage: y = x+x
      sage: y
      2 + O(3^10)
      sage: x + y
      3 + O(3^11)

   The same works for the multiplication:

      sage: z = x^2
      sage: z
      1 + O(3^10)
      sage: x*z
      1 + O(3^11)

   This comes more funny when we are working with elements given at
   different precisions:

      sage: R = ZpLP(2, print_mode='terse')
      sage: x = R(1,10)
      sage: y = R(1,5)
      sage: z = x+y; z
      2 + O(2^5)
      sage: t = x-y; t
      0 + O(2^5)
      sage: z+t  # observe that z+t = 2*x
      2 + O(2^11)
      sage: z-t  # observe that z-t = 2*y
      2 + O(2^6)

      sage: x = R(28888,15)
      sage: y = R(204,10)
      sage: z = x/y; z
      242 + O(2^9)
      sage: z*y  # which is x
      28888 + O(2^15)

   The SOMOS sequence is the sequence defined by the recurrence:

      ..MATH::

      u_n =  rac {u_{n-1} u_{n-3} + u_{n-2}^2} {u_{n-4}}

   It is known for its numerical instability. On the one hand, one can
   show that if the initial values are invertible in mathbb{Z}_p and
   known at precision O(p^N) then all the next terms of the SOMOS
   sequence will be known at the same precision as well. On the other
   hand, because of the division, when we unroll the recurrence, we
   loose a lot of precision. Observe:

      sage: R = Zp(2, 30, print_mode='terse')
      sage: a,b,c,d = R(1,15), R(1,15), R(1,15), R(3,15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      4 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      13 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      55 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      21975 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      6639 + O(2^13)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      7186 + O(2^13)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      569 + O(2^13)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      253 + O(2^13)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      4149 + O(2^13)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      2899 + O(2^12)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      3072 + O(2^12)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      349 + O(2^12)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      619 + O(2^12)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      243 + O(2^12)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      3 + O(2^2)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      2 + O(2^2)

   If instead, we use the lattice precision, everything goes well:

      sage: R = ZpLP(2, 30, print_mode='terse')
      sage: a,b,c,d = R(1,15), R(1,15), R(1,15), R(3,15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      4 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      13 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      55 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      21975 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      23023 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      31762 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      16953 + O(2^15)
      sage: a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a; print d
      16637 + O(2^15)

      sage: for _ in range(100):
      ....:     a,b,c,d = b,c,d,(b*d+c*c)/a
      sage: a
      15519 + O(2^15)
      sage: b
      32042 + O(2^15)
      sage: c
      17769 + O(2^15)
      sage: d
      20949 + O(2^15)

   BEHIND THE SCENE:

   The precision is global. It is encoded by a lattice in a huge
   vector space whose dimension is the number of elements having this
   parent.

   Concretely, this precision datum is an instance of the class
   "sage.rings.padic.lattice_precision.PrecisionLattice". It is
   attached to the parent and is created at the same time as the
   parent. (It is actually a bit more subtle because two different
   parents may share the same instance; this happens for instance for
   a p-adic ring and its field of fractions.)

   This precision datum is accessible through the method
   "precision()":

      sage: R = ZpLP(5, print_mode='terse')
      sage: prec = R.precision()
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 0 object

   This instance knows about all elements of the parent, it is
   automatically updated when a new element (of this parent) is
   created:

      sage: x = R(3513,10)
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 1 object
      sage: y = R(176,5)
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 2 objects
      sage: z = R.random_element()
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 3 objects

   The method "tracked_elements()" provides the list of all tracked
   elements:

      sage: prec.tracked_elements()
      [3513 + O(5^10), 176 + O(5^5), ...]

   Similarly, when a variable is collected by the garbage collector,
   the precision lattice is updated. Note however that the update
   might be delayed. We can force it with the method "del_elements()":

      sage: z = 0
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 3 objects
      sage: prec.del_elements()
      sage: prec
      Precision Lattice on 2 objects

   The method "precision_lattice()" returns (a matrix defining) the
   lattice that models the precision. Here we have:

      sage: prec.precision_lattice()
      [9765625       0]
      [      0    3125]

   Observe that 5^10 = 9765625 and 5^5 = 3125. The above matrix then
   reflects the precision on x and y.

   Now, observe how the precision lattice changes while performing
   computations:

      sage: x, y = 3*x+2*y, 2*(x-y)
      sage: prec.del_elements()
      sage: prec.precision_lattice()
      [    3125 48825000]
      [       0 48828125]

   The matrix we get is no longer diagonal, meaning that some digits
   of precision are diffused among the two new elements x and y. They
   nevertheless show up when we compute for instance x+y:

      sage: x
      1516 + O(5^5)
      sage: y
      424 + O(5^5)
      sage: x+y
      17565 + O(5^11)

   It is these diffused digits of precision (which are tracked but do
   not appear on the printing) that allow to be always sharp on
   precision.

   PERFORMANCES:

   Each elementary operation requires significant manipulations on the
   lattice precision and then is costly. Precisely:

   * The creation of a new element has a cost O(n) when n is the
     number of tracked elements.

   * The destruction of one element has a cost O(m^2) when m is the
     distance between the destroyed element and the last one.
     Fortunately, it seems that m tends to be small in general (the
     dynamics of the list of tracked elements is rather close to that
     of a stack).

   It is nevertheless still possible to manipulate several hundred
   variables (e.g. squares matrices of size 5 or polynomials of degree
   20 are accessible).

   The class "PrecisionLattice" provides several features for
   introspection (especially concerning timings). If enables, it
   maintains an history of all actions and stores the wall time of
   each of them:

      sage: R = ZpLP(3)
      sage: prec = R.precision()
      sage: prec.history_enable()
      sage: M = random_matrix(R, 5)
      sage: d = M.determinant()
      sage: print prec.history()  # somewhat random

> Do you document somewhere why this does not follow the usual linkage pattern used elsewhere in the p-adics code?


I think the main answer is that it just hasn't been switched to the linkage pattern, but it should be.  The pRational will take some work to make this happen.  I'll be busy in the next few weeks working on an ANTS paper, but we can talk about this in Rennes.  In the mean time, I think if you want to push the code to github/gitlab that should be fine.

The reason is that (1) `coefficient` returns a multivariate polynomial and (2) if P is a multivariate polynomial, `list(P)` contains some multivariate polynomials in it as well.

The last commit fixes the bug. But I'm not sure that it's the correct way to do this.

There are issues with python3 division in lattice_precision:

```
source ./local/bin/sage-env
python -Qnew ./local/bin/sage-runtests src/sage/rings/padics

This can be seen also when adding
