In particular, the following example used to fail:

```
sage: P0.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: P1.<y> = Frac(P0)[]
sage: frac = (x/(x^2 + 1))*y + 1/(x^3 + 1)
sage: Frac(ZZ['x,y'])(frac)
(x^4*y + x^2 + x*y + 1)/(x^5 + x^3 + x^2 + 1)
```

<a id='comment:9'></a>Hi Vincent,

Thank you for your comments.

Replying to [comment:7 vdelecroix]:

Just a leftover from previous experiments.
