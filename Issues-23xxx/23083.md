I agree with your explanation. But note that this ticket is about the inconsistency between 

```
sage: E.subs({a1:1})
x
sage: E(a1=1)
x^a_1
```
It happens because the dict key is immediately replaced but the `kwds` dict key in `a1=1` is not:

```
sage: {a1:1}
{a_1: 1}
```

There is no way around that either because it points to the "correct" variable and because they key of the dict is the variable, not a string. So by the time you are doing the substitution, it is evaluated to `'a_1'`. It is the same problem if I called the Python variable `x`. It comes down to understanding the difference between a python variable and the actual symbolic variable. IMO, this is the correct behavior.
