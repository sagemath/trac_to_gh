Keywords: windows cygwin zlib

Since #22917.  Granted, I did not test that ticket, and said it looked fine in principle, so my bad.

Fails with

```
[zlib-1.2.11] gzlib.o:gzlib.c:(.text+0xa4b): undefined reference to `_wopen'
[zlib-1.2.11] gzlib.o:gzlib.c:(.text+0xa4b): relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_PC32 against undefined symbol `_wopen'
[zlib-1.2.11] gzlib.o:gzlib.c:(.text+0xbf9): undefined reference to `_wopen'

[zlib-1.2.11] collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
[zlib-1.2.11] make[3]: *** [Makefile:96: zlib1.dll] Error 1
```

`_wopen` is part of the MSVC runtime library, and I don't think should be used on Cygwin...
