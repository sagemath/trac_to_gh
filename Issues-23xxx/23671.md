<a id='comment:21'></a>I don't see any problem with the p-adic Gauss sums. Here is a test:

```
sage: def f(z,p):
....:    return z - (z^p-1)/(p*z^(p-1))

sage: from sage.arith.misc import gauss_sum
sage: from sage.rings.padics.misc import gauss_sum as padic_gauss_sum

sage: p = 19

sage: for i in range(10): z = f(z,p)

sage: for i in range(p-1):

....:    u = padic_gauss_sum(-i, p, 1, 10)
....:    print (t - u).is_zero()
```
returns all `True`.

I'm guessing the issue is the normalization of the comparison between abstract and p-adic roots of unity, which is critical to the Gauss-Koblitz formula. I haven't traced this fully, but it looks like in the lines:

```
                    prod(padic_gauss_sum(-xp * r, p, f, prec)
                         for xp in gamma_pos) /
                    prod(padic_gauss_sum(-xq * r, p, f, prec)
                         for xq in gamma_neg) *
```
if one changes `-xp * r` to `xp * r` and `-xq * r` to `xq * r`, then the most egregious doctest failures in `euler_factor` go away. (There remain cases where there is an unresolved sign ambiguity, which I need to stare at some more.)

In other news, I think the statement of the Gross-Koblitz formula in the docstring of the p-adic Gauss sum is missing an overall minus sign, which is in Robert's paper and also in the code.

According to Mark Watkins, Magma uses the formulas given in 11.1.1 of http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/papers/known.pdf for the sign of the local functional equation at good primes. (This is for even weight; for odd weight the sign is always +1.)

<a id='comment:44'></a>In other news, there are some mathematical errors in the docstring for the p-adic Gauss sum. Maybe we should go ahead and fix them on this ticket:

```
    Let `p` be a prime, `f` a positive integer, `q=p^f`, and `\pi` be
    the unique root of `f(x) = x^{p-1}+p` congruent to `\zeta_p-1` modulo
    `(\zeta_p-1)^2`. Let `0\leq a < q-1`. Then the Gross-Koblitz formula 
    gives us the value of the Gauss sum `g_q(a)` as a product of p-adic 
    Gamma functions as follows:

    .. MATH::

        g_q(a) = -\pi^s \prod_{0\leq i < f} \Gamma_p(a^{(i)}/(q-1)),

    where `s` is the sum of the digits of `a` in base `p` and the
    `a^{(i)}` have `p`-adic expansions obtained from cyclic
    permutations of that of `a`.
```
