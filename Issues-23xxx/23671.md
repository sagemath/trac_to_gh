Yes, this is typical. Either our p-adic Gauss sum has a problem, or my code has a problem. I wrote very parallel code for H_value and padic_H_value, but this does not prove that they are both correct. The H_value method seems to be working rather well, compared to the literature.

I don't see any problem with the p-adic Gauss sums. Here is a test:

```
sage: def f(z,p):
....:    return z - (z^p-1)/(p*z^(p-1))

sage: from sage.arith.misc import gauss_sum
sage: from sage.rings.padics.misc import gauss_sum as padic_gauss_sum

sage: p = 19
sage: R = padic_gauss_sum(1, p, 1, 10).parent()
sage: z = 1 - R.gen()
sage: for i in range(10): z = f(z,p)
sage: z *= R.teichmuller(GF(p).multiplicative_generator())
sage: S.<a> = CyclotomicField(p*(p-1))

sage: for i in range(p-1):
....:    t = gauss_sum(S.zeta(p-1)^i, GF(p)).polynomial()(z)
....:    u = padic_gauss_sum(-i, p, 1, 10)
....:    print (t - u).is_zero()
```
returns all `True`.

I'm guessing the issue is the normalization of the comparison between abstract and p-adic roots of unity, which is critical to the Gauss-Koblitz formula. I haven't traced this fully, but it looks like in the lines:

```
                    prod(padic_gauss_sum(-xp * r, p, f, prec)
                         for xp in gamma_pos) /
                    prod(padic_gauss_sum(-xq * r, p, f, prec)
                         for xq in gamma_neg) *
```
if one changes `-xp * r` to `xp * r` and `-xq * r` to `xq * r`, then the most egregious doctest failures in `euler_factor` go away. (There remain cases where there is an unresolved sign ambiguity, which I need to stare at some more.)

In other news, I think the statement of the Gross-Koblitz formula in the docstring of the p-adic Gauss sum is missing an overall minus sign, which is in Robert's paper and also in the code.

I think I found the remaining issue with `padic_H_value`. The problem is actually in `convert_to_Z`:

```
    p_ring = x.parent().base_ring()
    p = p_ring.prime()
    L = x.list()
    print(p_ring, p, L)
    return ZZ.sum(L[(p - 1) * i] * (-p) ** i
                  for i in range(1 + len(L) // (p - 1)))
```
The trouble is that `x.list()` behaves differently for an element of a p-adic ring (in which case it starts from 0) and an element of a p-adic field (in which case it starts from the valuation).

There are various ways to fix this. One would be to replace `L = x.list()` with:

```
    # Pass from field to ring so that list() starts from p^0.
    y = x.parent().integer_ring()(x)
    L = y.list()
```
to force the ring behavior.

In other news, there are some mathematical errors in the docstring for the p-adic Gauss sum. Maybe we should go ahead and fix them on this ticket:

```
    Let `p` be a prime, `f` a positive integer, `q=p^f`, and `\pi` be
    the unique root of `f(x) = x^{p-1}+p` congruent to `\zeta_p-1` modulo
    `(\zeta_p-1)^2`. Let `0\leq a < q-1`. Then the Gross-Koblitz formula 
    gives us the value of the Gauss sum `g_q(a)` as a product of p-adic 
    Gamma functions as follows:

    .. MATH::

        g_q(a) = -\pi^s \prod_{0\leq i < f} \Gamma_p(a^{(i)}/(q-1)),

    where `s` is the sum of the digits of `a` in base `p` and the
    `a^{(i)}` have `p`-adic expansions obtained from cyclic
    permutations of that of `a`.
```

Definitely get this feature set into Sage first, then create separate tickets for additional features (like the Euler factors at bad reduction primes). This progress might serve as the basis for organizing a Sage Days on HGM sooner or later.

As soon as this is ready to go to `needs_review` I will start looking more critically (particularly at the documentation, which so far I have mostly ignored).

This commit implements my suggestion to do the computation entirely in Z_p by using the Gauss-Koblitz formula in factored form. Even saving a factor of p, it still seems to be much slower than Magma; not sure whether there is a single reason for that.

Just to say that I agree with the name change. We could also have another class for objects where t has been chosen.

And I also agree with the switch t <-> 1/t.

<a id='comment:76'>Comment 76:</a>
I have some small concerns :

1) we should move the references to the master-reference-file,

2) I would prefer to have more explanations in the doc everywhere.

But I think it can be set to "needs_review" once 1) is done.

I am going to do 1) right now.

While more documentation would be nice, there is overall a big lack of documentation in this whole area of mathematics; anyway I would propose to get some reviewer feedback on that front.

I don't see any causal doctest failures in the patchbot logs.
