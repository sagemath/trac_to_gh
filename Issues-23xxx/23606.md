Rename `LaurentPolynomial_generic` to `LaurentPolynomial` (it's not a "generic" implementation, it's an abstract base class) and put some abstract methods there, like `cpdef _add_`.

> Should we worry about old pickles?

I don't think so because

1. There shouldn't exist objects of type `LaurentPolynomial_generic` in the first place, only of subclasses.

2. It's a Cython class so pickling probably won't work anyway.
