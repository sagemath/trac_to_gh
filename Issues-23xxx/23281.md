We currently use representatives between 0 and p^n-1 where is the precision (either absolute or relative depending on context).   The issue below for floating point p-adics suggests that it would be better to use balanced representatives, between -p^n/2 and p^n/2.

Currently, we have:

```
sage: R = ZpFP(2)   # prec = 20
sage: R(1+2^19) + R(1+2^19)
2
```

If we switch to balanced representatives, `1+2^19` is no longer a representative at precision 20; it is instead represented by 1-2^19.  The sum would be `2-2^20`.  

Once we make the switch to balanced representatives, we should first perform the addition and then round the result according to its valuation.  Negation becomes trivial.

This isn't a high priority, but would be nice.

I finally have an objection :-)

If we do this, then the opposite of `x = 1` would be `y = 2^20 - 1` and `x+y` would be equal to `2^20`, meaning that we would break the axiom `x + (-x) = 0`. The correct way to handle this is to choose balanced representatives but it's a lot of work...
