There are Fortran compilers which give better than gfortran performance, e.g. Intel's ifort.
It is currently not possible (without a hack) to build Sage using any of these.

This ought to be fixed.

We package flang for only Linux and Windows on conda. OSX is still not supprted, but I don't think it would take much time given that flang can be used on FreeBSD. (Windows support is also by a fork we maintain until upstream decides on a CLA which seems to be taking a lot of time.)

By the way, is there any chance that FreeBSD (or perhaps DragonflyBSD, which is also clang-based w.r.t. the toolchain) gets properly supported by Conda (i.e. in more or less the same way as Linux and OSX are)?

Apart from some linking issues in `src/sage/misc/inline_fortran.py` (somewhere `-lgfortran` hardcoded, etc), I see little to no difference with Sage tests using `gfortran`.

I don't think Anaconda, Inc ever will unless there is a paying customer.

That said there are some people maintaining conda packages for other non-supported platforms like https://github.com/jjhelmus/berryconda

If you want to build conda packages in FreeBSD, conda-forge recipes are a good place.
Another option would be to create a conda package from the sage package like I used to do. (I abandoned it because it wouldn't be compatible with the rest of conda packages on other channels, but in the FreeBSD case, that shouldn't matter)

Yeah, there seem to be no flang on OSX available as yet.
Flang on FreeBSD is an out-of-tree branch ATM, too.
So this is all in a flux now.

I guess it might be wise to wait until flang can be built with unmodified clang...

<a id='comment:10'></a>Just for giggles and lols, I tried building Sage 8.7.beta0 using flang on FreeBSD 12.0, and it just works! 

Well, it needs various FFLAGS and LDFLAGS to be passed, which is probably more of a FreeBSD bug than anything else, and I didn't trace down why scipy tries to link with libgfortran.so (I ended up just faking libgfortran.so, making it a link to libm.so :-))

But the fact that the configuration just works otherwise, means that this ticket is almost done, all of a sudden!

The quality of flang leaves much to be desired especially in complex domain arithmetic, at least openblas tests and Sage tests show a number of errors, but, OK, it is probably fixable on the flang side...

Yes, I know one can do `python setup.py build --fcompiler=$FC`, assuming `FC` holds the compiler, but how to combine this
with installation by `pip3`?

Does it? How does one tell `config_fc` which Fortran compiler one wants?

Another "interesting" story there is how does one tell `config_fc` what to do with Fortran files which need
a pre-processor? There are Fortran compilers that don't do preprocessing itself, e.g. nagfor from NAG doesn't understand
`-D` and `-U` options one might need to run on .F files (with C-style `#ifdefs`); it comes with an `fpp` utility that is supposed to be run on such files. See https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/13222#issuecomment-927962803
