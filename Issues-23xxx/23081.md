My initial attempt was to build a new list of edges to spare the expense of creating a new graph, but when I saw how complicated that would be because of all the methods and data structures associated with the graph (an edge list, an edge iterator, a dictionary with vertex pairs as keys and edge labels as values), I decided to keep it simple, and I reset my earlier commits.

It works now, but it's a little inconsistent, and I'm not sure how to best resolve it. The problem is when the set of edge labels is a mix of other types. For simple graphs G, if an edge label is not in RR, the weight of that edge is set to `1`. Otherwise the label is used as the edge weight. (Incidentally, I need to go back to bipartite matchings and make it act like this too.) If G allows multiple edges, however, `G.allow_multiple_edges(False, keep_label='max')` will directly compare the labels of parallel edges and keep the highest one *without* first setting the weight of strings or `None` to `1`.

The solution I'm considering is to modify the code of `allow_multiple_edges` so it assigns edges a weight before comparing them, the way `matching` does now. However, this seems like it could be too broad of a change. Another solution is to trust the user to make their edge labels consistent before trying to take a weighted matching. I don't know if that is in line with the [SageMath](SageMath) design philosphy.

Working with loops, multiple edges and weights is a mess. The behavior and the terminology (`use_edge_labels` or `by_weights` or etc.) should be unified. For instance, you can pass a `weight_function` to `shortest_path`. This is convenient and forces the user to be careful with the kind of labels and how to use it. Such improvement is however a hard task.

A problem with loops:
I don't no why the matching method uses `self._scream_if_not_simple(allow_loops=True)`. It is not documented and it causes the following issue:

```
sage: G = Graph([(0,0),(0,1),(1,1)], loops=True)
sage: G.matching(algorithm='LP')
[(0, 0, None), (1, 1, None)]
sage: G.matching(algorithm='Edmonds')
[(0, 1, None)]
```


Now, if you want to make the matching method work with multiple edges, you can avoid a copy of the graph as follows. This is certainly not the most elegant method, but it's working.

```
        #self._scream_if_not_simple(allow_loops=True)
        from sage.rings.real_mpfr import RR
        def weight(x):
            if x in RR:
                return x
            else:
                return 1

        def reorder(u, v):
            if u < v:
                return u, v

                return v, u

        W = dict()
        for u,v,l in self.edge_iterator():
            u, v = reorder(u, v)
            if u is v:
                continue

                l = weight(l)
            if not (u, v) in W or ( (u, v) in W and use_edge_labels and W[u, v] < l ):

            else:
                for u, v in W:
                    g.add_edge(u, v)
            d = networkx.max_weight_matching(g)

                    return sum(W[u, v] for u, v in six.iteritems(d) if u < v)
                else:
                    return Integer(len(d) // 2)
            else:
                return [(u, v, W[u, v]) for u, v in six.iteritems(d) if u < v]

        elif algorithm == "LP":
            from sage.numerical.mip import MixedIntegerLinearProgram
            # returns the weight of an edge considering it may not be
            # weighted ...
            p = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True, solver=solver)
            b = p.new_variable(binary=True)

On

```
sage: H = graphs.GeneralizedPetersenGraph(600,8)
sage: %lprun -f H.matching H.matching(use_edge_labels=True)
```
over 99% of the time is spent on the call to networkx:

```
  4418         1      6946726 6946726.0     99.4              d = networkx.max_weight_matching(g)
```
Similarly when `use_edge_labels=False`. When I do `algorithm='LP'`, similar amount of time is spent doing the LP stuff.

Conclusion: There is almost no speed to be gained except on really small graphs. So there is nothing else to really optimize out, at least by these examples.
