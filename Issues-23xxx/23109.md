The function `richcmp_by_eq_and_lt` from `src/sage/rings/asymptotic/misc.py` should be moved to `src/sage/structure/richcmp.pyx`.

I would also like to change the semantics slightly: this would be more useful if the method names (i.e. `_eq_` and `_lt_`) would be an argument like `_richcmp_ = richcmp_by_eq_and_lt("_eq_", "_lt_")`. This way, it can also be used with the standard Python methods `__eq__` and `__lt__`.

It's only for efficiency. If we already know `other_eq`, it's more efficient to use it instead. Python's implementation of rich comparisons assumes that `a == b` is the same as `b == a`, so it shouldn't hurt.

2. Is there a reason for using `op_LT` and `Py_LT`?

3. Docstring:

`those` vs. `these`. I am not native English speaking, but shoudn't it be the latter?

Apart from these comments; the code looks fine. Let's see what the patchbot says.

It might be strange but it's not wrong. From [PEP 207](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0207/):

```
    4 The reflexivity rules *are* assumed by Python.  Thus, the
      interpreter may swap y>x with x<y, y>=x with x<=y, and may swap
      the arguments of x==y and x!=y.
