Currently, we have in `Parent.__init__`:

```python
    def __init__(...):
        ...
        if element_constructor is None:
            self._set_element_constructor()
        else:
            self._element_constructor = element_constructor
            self._element_init_pass_parent = guess_pass_parent(self, element_constructor)
```
and `Parent._set_element_constructor`:

```python
    def _set_element_constructor(self):
        """
        This function is used in translating from the old to the new coercion model.
        """
        try: #if hasattr(self, '_element_constructor_'):
            _element_constructor_ = self._element_constructor_
        except (AttributeError, TypeError):
            # Remark: A TypeError can actually occur;
            # it is a possible reason for "hasattr" to return False
            return
        assert callable(_element_constructor_)
        self._element_constructor = _element_constructor_
        self._element_init_pass_parent = guess_pass_parent(self, self._element_constructor)
```
and in the parent methods of `Sets()` we have

```python
        @lazy_attribute
        def _element_constructor_(self):
            if hasattr(self, "element_class"):
                return self._element_constructor_from_element_class
            else:
                return NotImplemented
```
That's quite contorted. `__init__` calls `set_element_constructor`. If the category framework is used, then at that point we have initialised the category, which is a sub-category of `Sets()`. Therefore, by virtue of the category framework, self actually has `_element_constructor_ `, from `Sets.ParentMethods`.

Then, `_set_element_constructor` assigns `self._element_constructor_` to `self._element_constructor` without trailing underscore. And the lazy attribute `_element_constructor_` inherited from the categories tries whether self has an `element_class`. This, in turn, is a lazy attribute that (in its default implementation) depends on whether self has the attribute `Element`.

That's bizarre and should be simplified.

Currently, it seems that there are too many ways to customize element creation: Overriding `Parent.__call__` (very bad), overriding `_element_constructor`, overriding `_element_constructor_`, overriding `element_class`, definition `.Element`. I suppose some of these ways just exist for historic reasons and should be removed.

Of course we have to discuss what customization we shall allow. The minimum we want to have is this:

- If `_element_constructor_` is defined by the user, then it will be used for element construction. If multiple element classes are involved (homsets), then that's what one has to do.

- If `.Element` is assigned and the category framework is invoked, then `element_class` should be available as well and it should be a possible way to implement element creation.

But I am not so sure whether we should allow to override the default implementation of `element_class`. If we could agree that defining `_element_constructor_` or `.Element` are the **only** customisation hooks, we would already have a substantial simplification.

It depends. If you allow, as one way of customisation, to pass `element_constructor` as an argument of `Parent.__init__` or to `populate_coercion_lists` (which, I believe, should not be the allowed!), then you need that check sooner or later.

But what is `Parent._element_constructor`? It either is a callable that is passed during `Parent.__init__` or `Parent._populate_coercion_lists`, or it is the same as `_element_constructor_`. If we disallowed passing an element constructor as an argument, there would be no difference between the version with and without trailing underscore.

Does the following scheme make sense to you?

- `_element_constructor` (without trailing underscore) should be removed.
- There should be a default implementation of `_element_constructor_` for `Parent` (it currently does not exist). As a backup, we might keep a copy in `Sets.ParentMethods`. The default implementation passes the arguments to `self.element_class` and add `parent` to these arguments. It is one hook for customisation.
- The comment "This probably should go into Sets().Parent" should be removed. All objects in the category of sets should be implemented as a subclass of `Parent`. The default implementation of `element_class` should stay as it is, thus, rely on `Element`, which is one hook for customisation (the category used in initialising the parent is another hook). The element class has to accept `parent` as a named argument.
- Remove `guess_pass_parent`. `self(*args,**kwds)` should (after coercion) call `self._element_constructor_`, and this has the responsibility to pass `self` to whatever class is used for the elements.

Isn't one of the reasons we have this is because we still have some old-style parents not setting their category lingering around?

Also, all categories are (currently) subcategories of `Sets` (i.e., are concrete categories), and to be a parent, you have to be in the category of `Sets`. So I removed the "usually" in the description.

> What do categories have to do with this?

See description. This ticket is about simplifying the customisation logic of element construction. It seems that the underlying reason for the current contortion is that the current implementation makes it possible to let the category framework be involved.

Let me elaborate on it.
- One can imagine that it makes sense to provide a generic `_element_constructor_` for some categories.
- But methods of `Parent` would have precedence over `WhateverCategory.ParentMethods`.
- Supposedly the above was the reason to *not* implement the most generic `_element_constructor_` in `Parent`: A customisation via categories is only possible if `Parent` does not have a generic implementation.

So, we have first to answer this question: Do we want that an object gets its element constructor from its category? Currently, the category framework provides `_element_constructor_" in semigroups, sets and facade_sets. The one from sets belongs (I believe) to Parent. I didn't look at the other two yet. In any case, the current category framework makes little use of that possibility.

Agreed. However, if "cleaning up the mess" is only possible by making it impossible to customise element creation via categories, then I'd be against it - unless the clean up also implies a speed up.

Hence, without an example of a slow parent creation, I would think that #23881 and the other tickets do provide a simplification of the customisation logic and that it is not needed, e.g., to have a default `Parent._element_constructor_`.

That was me (Martin Rubey = mantepse), the slowness I observed is *where the time is spent*in `Set([1,2,3])`, originally in #23873 and, more precisely in [#23877 comment:9](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23877#comment:9) and the comments above that.
