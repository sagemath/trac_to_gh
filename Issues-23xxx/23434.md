The algebraic_scheme.py file in the schemes folder currently contains the code for all types of subschemes (affine, projective, products of projective space, toric). This makes the file quite large. This ticket splits the subscheme functionality by type into their respective folders; i.e. affine subscheme functionality will now live at affine/affine_subscheme.py

There is no functionality change with the ticket, just a re-organization and some minor doc cleanup.

I had to make a couple non-trivial changes to projective_subscheme.py as well as a couple imports in dynamical systems to get the interaction between subschemes and dynamical systems correct.  Sorry, but those changes are mixed into the merge. You'll need to look at the diff on those specific files to see them.
