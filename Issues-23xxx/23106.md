Many of the scripts in `src/bin` start with `#!/usr/bin/env python` (which is Python 2) and then try to import from the Sage library. This will not work if Sage has been installed using `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

These scripts need modification, and perhaps there are others:

- sage-cython: `from sage.env import SAGE_SRC` -- could be modified to avoid this import, for example using `os.getenv('SAGE_SRC')`

- sage-eval

- sage-fixdoctests

- sage-ipython: particularly important, since it is used to run Sage.

- sage-list-packages

- sage-notebook

- sage-preparse

- sage-rst2sws

- sage-rst2txt

- sage-run-cython

- sage-runtests

- sage-startuptime.py

- sage-sws2rst

- sage-env-config.in is a false positive: it is a shell script and does no importing of Python modules.

- sage-cython is easy to fix:

I don't think that makes any sense. It won't be *that* long before Python 2 is deprecated and removed entirely.  `python` should just be whatever the default python is.

To clarify, it's not just that Volker once said it, it's [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/).

I think we need to make a design decision before we can make progress on this ticket. Once you set `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` (or set the appropriate configure flag, some time in the future), does that forever "pollute" the Sage scripts so that they use python3, or do we want to somehow allow python2 and python3 builds to live side by side?

There are a few Sage packages which depend on Python and build libraries which do not reside in `local/lib/python$VERSION/`, and those present obstacles to side-by-side builds.

I don't particularly care where the scripts live in the source code--I think that scripts are needed at build time living in `src/bin` makes sense, but don't have strong opinions about it.

All that matters to me is what happens at installation.  I think all scripts in `build/bin` should be installed to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.
