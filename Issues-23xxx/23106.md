Many of the scripts in `src/bin` start with `#!/usr/bin/env python` (which is Python 2) and then try to import from the Sage library. This will not work if Sage has been installed using `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

These scripts need modification, and perhaps there are others:

- sage-cython: `from sage.env import SAGE_SRC` -- could be modified to avoid this import, for example using `os.getenv('SAGE_SRC')`

- sage-eval

- sage-fixdoctests

- sage-ipython: particularly important, since it is used to run Sage.

- sage-list-packages

- sage-notebook

- sage-preparse

- sage-rst2sws

- sage-rst2txt

- sage-run-cython

- sage-runtests

- sage-startuptime.py

- sage-sws2rst

- sage-env-config.in is a false positive: it is a shell script and does no importing of Python modules.

- sage-cython is easy to fix:

I tried to explain this in [comment:2](#comment%3A2).\n\nThat's a fair point. I think you're right--better it just be `/usr/bin/env python`.  I don't think it makes sense to have side-by-side Python 2 and Python 3 installations of Sage, or the ability to switch between on the fly.  That may be slightly convenient for working on Python 3 compatibility *development*, but that only affects a few people who can probably afford to have two separate builds for those purposes.  One thing I am working with \"abstract package\" support is a better way (better than setting `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`) to select the default Python at `./configure` time, but changing that selection still requires a rebuild of anything that depends on Python.",

The Sage community has not made any decisions about how to actually run Sage using Python 3. As a result, I am somewhat wary of just using `sage-python23` everywhere. I tried to explain this in [comment:2](#comment%3A2).

That's a fair point. I think you're right--better it just be `/usr/bin/env python`.  I don't think it makes sense to have side-by-side Python 2 and Python 3 installations of Sage, or the ability to switch between on the fly.  That may be slightly convenient for working on Python 3 compatibility *development*, but that only affects a few people who can probably afford to have two separate builds for those purposes.  One thing I am working with "abstract package" support is a better way (better than setting `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`) to select the default Python at `./configure` time, but changing that selection still requires a rebuild of anything that depends on Python.

To clarify, it's not just that Volker once said it, it's [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/).

I think we need to make a design decision before we can make progress on this ticket.

There are a few Sage packages which depend on Python and build libraries which do not reside in `local/lib/python$VERSION/`, and those present obstacles to side-by-side builds.

I don't particularly care where the scripts live in the source code--I think that scripts are needed at build time living in `src/bin` makes sense, but don't have strong opinions about it.

All that matters to me is what happens at installation.  I think all scripts in `build/bin` should be installed to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.  Similarly I'm of the opinion that most other files in `build/` should be installed somewhere under `$SAGE_LOCAL` so that, for example, one can install new packages for Sage at runtime without having a full sage source tree lying around.
