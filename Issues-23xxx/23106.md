CC:  @jdemeyer @embray

Many of the scripts in `src/bin` start with `#!/usr/bin/env python` (which is Python 2) and then try to import from the Sage library. This will not work if Sage has been installed using `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes`.

These scripts need modification, and perhaps there are others:

- sage-cython: `from sage.env import SAGE_SRC` -- could be modified to avoid this import, for example using `os.getenv('SAGE_SRC')`

- sage-eval

- sage-fixdoctests

- sage-ipython: particularly important, since it is used to run Sage.

- sage-list-packages

- sage-notebook

- sage-preparse

- sage-rst2sws

- sage-rst2txt

- sage-run-cython

- sage-runtests

- sage-startuptime.py

- sage-sws2rst

I think we need to make a design decision before we can make progress on this ticket. Once you set `SAGE_PYTHON3=yes` (or set the appropriate configure flag, some time in the future), does that forever "pollute" the Sage scripts so that they use python3, or do we want to somehow allow python2 and python3 builds to live side by side? If the former, we need to either save the setting so that future incremental builds in the same directory continue to use SAGE_PYTHON3=yes, or we let users shoot themselves in the foot by building with Python 3 and then a few weeks later upgrading matplotlib and forgetting to set the variable, so it tries to use Python 2 and something goes horribly wrong.

There are a few Sage packages which depend on Python and build libraries which do not reside in `local/lib/python$VERSION/`, and those present obstacles to side-by-side builds.

But currently this doesn't even work since some libraries, such as Pynac, can't be be installed with Python 2 and Python 3 support simultaneously (this could be fixed, for example, by attaching the Python version to the SONAME of the library, but I don't think that's currently supported).\n\nThat said, from a more general user perspective I don't think there's much advantage.  I think it will be much, much simpler if `SAGE_PYTHON3` is treated solely as a built-time variable that indicates what Python should be used to build and run Sage.  And of course it should really be replaced with a `./configure` flag.  I think that makes the whole affair much, much simpler.\n\nOne thing that should still be possible is re-configuring with a different `--with-python=` flag, and rebuilding with that Python.

From a development perspective there's a convenience to allowing simultaneous Python 2 and Python 3 installations to live side-by-side.  But currently this doesn't even work since some libraries, such as Pynac, can't be be installed with Python 2 and Python 3 support simultaneously (this could be fixed, for example, by attaching the Python version to the SONAME of the library, but I don't think that's currently supported).

That said, from a more general user perspective I don't think there's much advantage.  I think it will be much, much simpler if `SAGE_PYTHON3` is treated solely as a built-time variable that indicates what Python should be used to build and run Sage.  And of course it should really be replaced with a `./configure` flag.  I think that makes the whole affair much, much simpler.

One thing that should still be possible is re-configuring with a different `--with-python=` flag, and rebuilding with that Python.  I had some success making that work in my experimental ticket #23465.

I don't particularly care where the scripts live in the source code--I think that scripts are needed at build time living in `src/bin` makes sense, but don't have strong opinions about it.

All that matters to me is what happens at installation.  I think all scripts in `build/bin` should be installed to `$SAGE_LOCAL/bin`.
