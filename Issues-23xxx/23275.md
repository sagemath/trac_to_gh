Loops should not be allowed in a bipartite graph, but we can currently do:

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: B.add_edge(0, 0)
sage: B.is_bipartite()
False
sage: B.add_edge(1, 1)
sage: B.add_edge(2, 2)
sage: B.edges(labels=0)
[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'a')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
sage: B.add_edge(3, 3)
sage: B.edges()
[(0, 0, None), (1, 1, None), (2, 2, None), (3, 3, None)]
```
When adding edges in a different order, the behavior is more consistent.

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(loops=True, multiedges=True)
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'a')
sage: B.add_edge(0, 1, 'b')
sage: B.is_bipartite()
True
sage: B.add_edge(0,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.

A bit of reading suggests that this is intentional behavior on the `graph6` and `sparse6` data types, respectively. Makes me wish the code were commented better. https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt

For bipartite graphs, the offending code that adds loops is

```
        if self.left.issuperset((u, v)) or self.right.issuperset((u, v)):
            raise RuntimeError(
                "Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.")
```
because if `u` is `v` and it's a new vertex, it won't notice that it's making a loop. But loops should be disallowed before this code is reached.

So `__init__` should definitely have loops turned off, and maybe bipartite_graph.py should have an override for `allow_loops()` that just raises an error. A user determined to break it could go around and call the `Graph` method to enable loops, so maybe have a check in generic_graph.py, like

```
    def allow_loops(self, new, check=True):
        if isinstance(BipartiteGraph):
            raise ...
```
But that might be overreaching.

I fully agree. The graph module is one of the best of sagemath for the quality of its documentation, but it's not enough. An effort was started here #19477 but not finalized.

  

> So `__init__` should definitely have loops turned off, and maybe bipartite_graph.py should have an override for `allow_loops()` that just raises an error. A user determined to break it could go around and call the `Graph` method to enable loops, so maybe have a check in generic_graph.py, like

I was thinking to implement something like that.

One of my concern is the use of `**argv` in `__init__`. One possibility is to 
- explicitly list authorized parameters, so not listing `loops`
- explicitly set `loops=False` in all calls to other constructors
- set the loops flag to `False`
- rewrite `self.allow_loops` to forbid `self.allow_loops(True)`. It would be better to remove methods from the class, but I don't know how to do that.

This fixes some of the issues but it's neither a smart solution nor a complete fix.

Indeed, the following example should raises an error and not silently remove loops, no ?

```
sage: G = Graph([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)], loops=True)
sage: B = BipartiteGraph(G)
sage: B.edges(labels=0)
[(0, 1)]
```
At least, we can't add loops.

```
sage: sage: B.add_edge(0,0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Edge vertices must lie in different partitions.
```

<a id='comment:9'>Comment 9:</a>
To avoid that, we should make a backend

```
sage: B = BipartiteGraph()
sage: B._backend
<type 'sage.graphs.base.sparse_graph.SparseGraphBackend'>
```
The method `Graph.allow_loops(B, True)` calls `B._backend.loops(True)`.
