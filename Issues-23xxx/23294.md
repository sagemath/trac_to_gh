Current Cython accepts code like

```
cimport sage.structure.category_object
 
cdef class Parent(category_object.CategoryObject):
    ...
```

This is wrong but Cython accepts it by mistake. In Cython master, this becomes an error.

This fixes a few remaining issues after #23254 and also cleans up the imports in `parent.pyx`.
