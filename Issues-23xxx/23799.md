Given that the procedure is the same each time

```
X_pc = pkgconfig.parse('X')
X_libs = X_pc['libraries']
X_library_dirs = X_pc['library_dirs']
X_cflags = pkgconfig.cflags('X').split()
```
could that be factored? (slight lie: no cflags involved for gsl, no include dirs for linbox, ... why?)

As far as I know, those files do not actually depend on linbox, fflas-ffpack or givaro.

They do actually link against linbox, but the linbox, fflas-ffpack and givaro flags are brought in by cimports of `sage.libs.linbox....` at the beginning of `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_float.pyx` and `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_double.pyx`

Which list of libraries do you mean?

At least when compiling those extensions, `-llinbox -llinboxsage` is specified. This is true before and after this ticket.

If your comment is that `-llinbox` is specified while it is not needed: that is outside the scope of this ticket. There are probably many such cases.

That is the case. But now I am more worried about the lack of `-lfflas -lffpack -lgivaro` but given the bot is green, I am guessing it gets in the same way as `-llinbox`. Let's move things along.
