```
X_pc = pkgconfig.parse('X')
X_libs = X_pc['libraries']

could that be factored? (slight lie: no cflags involved for gsl, no include dirs for linbox, ... why?)

It is correct that those don't link to linbox, but the linbox flags provide linking flags to fflas, ffpack and givaro that are needed. Are those brought by a dependency that can escape a cursory look? I could not find any distutils instructions in those particular files to account for the dependencies on fflas, ffpack and givaro.

As far as I know, those files do not actually depend on linbox, fflas-ffpack or givaro.

They do actually link against linbox, but the linbox, fflas-ffpack and givaro flags are brought in by cimports of `sage.libs.linbox....` at the beginning of `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_float.pyx` and `src/sage/matrix/matrix_modn_dense_double.pyx`

Which list of libraries do you mean?

At least when compiling those extensions, `-llinbox -llinboxsage` is specified. This is true before and after this ticket.

That is the case. But now I am more worried about the lack of `-lfflas -lffpack -lgivaro` but given the bot is green, I am guessing it gets in the same way as `-llinbox`. Let's move things along.
