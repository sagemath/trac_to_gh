Currently at least in `guava`, a part of `gap_packages`, there is a hardcoded `gcc` in some makefiles.

```
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: Entering directory '/usr/home/dima/Sage/sage/local/gap/gap-4.8.6/pkg/guava-3.13'
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] if test ! -d bin/amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0-clang-devel-default64;  then mkdir -p bin/amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0-clang-devel-default64;  fi
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] gcc -O2   -c -o src/ctjhai/minimum-weight.o src/ctjhai/minimum-weight.c
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] make[2]: gcc: Command not found
```

As well, I see in `grape` log there

```
[gap_packages-4.8.6.p2] checking host system type... Invalid configuration `amd64-unknown-freebsd11.0': machine `amd64-unknown' not recognized
```
but this is otherwise seemingly harmless.
