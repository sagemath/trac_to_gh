The `normalize` member function is one of many where signals from underlying layers are not caught. Let's do a sweeping fix of them in this ticket.

What you are doing is essentially

```
sig_on()
try:
    initialize()
    res = c_lib_call()
    return process(res)
finally:
    sig_off
```
Instead, it should be

```
initialize()
sig_on()
res = c_lib_call()
sig_off()

1. To allow interrupting a long-running operation.

2. For error handling from low-level C libraries like FLINT (which is what this ticket is about).

None of these reasons have anything to do with C++ exceptions, so I wonder why you brought that up.

What is true is that `cysignals` was not written with C++ in mind. Maybe one could reimplement parts of `cysignals` to be more C++-friendly, for example by raising C++ exceptions (which are then converted to Python exceptions by Cython).

Yes, like in your first branch. However, your branch had many wrong usages like

```
sig_on()
Python code
Pynac call
Python code
sig_off()
```
That is certainly wrong. It should be

```

Python code
```
