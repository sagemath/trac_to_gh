Two sage-devel postings about this:

https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/W9iVNPsIJVA/3EQO__OxAwAJ

Seems some of this was already known in mpir and ecm:


```
(sage-sh) jan@muizenberg:sage-8.0$ grep SAGE_FAT_BINARY build/pkgs/*/spkg-install|grep not
build/pkgs/ecm/spkg-install:    echo >&2 "Warning: SAGE_FAT_BINARY is currently not really supported by this package."
build/pkgs/mpir/spkg-install:            echo "Cannot build with SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes."
(sage-sh) jan@muizenberg:sage-8.0$
```

This is possibly gcc 6.2 related:
https://mail.coreboot.org/pipermail/coreboot/2016-December/082739.html

And a possible solution is Build GMP `--with-pic`, (only) if GCC defaults to `-pie` (preferred solution from reading the rest of above thread to the end).

UPDATE: --with-pic did not work for me; trying now with CFLAGS="-fPIC"

UPDATE2:
export CFLAGS="--with-pic"; ./sage -f mpir; make # failed to build
export CFLAGS="-fPIC"; ./sage -f mpir; make # completed build (well most packages except doc-html eventually failed to build with OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory in a 4G Virtual Machine.

UPDATE 3: From scratch start with
export CFLAGS="-fPIC" CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" SAGE_FAT_BINARY=yes
make # ecm failed to build
