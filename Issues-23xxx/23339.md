In #20986 I made some "enhancements" to the sage-rebase*.sh scripts that are used on Cygwin for DLL rebasing.  While `sage-rebase.sh` works fine, the `sage-rebaseall.sh` script was left with two fatal defects:

* An outright syntax error in bash
* Because it is now a wrapper around `sage-rebase.sh` it will not work unless `sage-rebase.sh` is invoked with `dash` as opposed to `bash` (`dash` is a stripped-down version of `bash` with no dependencies on external libraries that is shipped with Cygwin--it is needed when running `rebaseall` since that updates *all* DLLs in Cygwin, including the Cygwin DLL itself).

<a id='comment:2'></a>On a Virtulbox running Windows10 professional, I compiled 8.0.rc0 + #21399 + #23339 (as suggested in [the Wiki](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/Cygwin64Port)) + #23097 + #21233 (present ticket) with the options :

```
export PREREQ_OPTIONS=--with-blas=atlas
export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib
export MAKE="make -j4"
```

This passes `ptestlong` with no failures.

==> `positive_review`

Note : I have no advice on the contents of the patches (I do not know Cygwin well enough to undetstand what they are supposed to do) ; I just checked that this leads to a functional Sage.

I agree, it's ugly.  Maybe it should be prefixed with a ``@``.
