Strong -1 on this. IMO, the `__init__` should generally be a short docstring to begin with (the main doc with inputs, etc. should (generally) be at the class-level). It is basically hidden from the user and the public API. Also, the `__init__` is a good place to put a `TestSuite` test. I wasn't paying attention with the first implementation and should have mentioned it then.

I am willing to let this in with that because it was done previously, but I dislike it.

I actually asked back then, and was told to do it this way.  I'm happy to do it differently, because the **current setup does not work**.

Please keep in mind that I took great care that new variants of growth diagrams are as easy to implement as possible.  For example, the following is enough for many purposes - ideally, hitting `GrowthMinimal?` should even display most of the generic documentation!

```
sage: from sage.combinat.growth import GrowthDiagram
sage: class GrowthMinimal(GrowthDiagram):
....:     _zero = 0
....:     _rank_function = lambda self,x: x
....:     _backward_rule = lambda self,y,z,x: (min(x,y), 0 if y==z or x==z else 1)
sage: GrowthMinimal(labels=[0,1,2,1,2,1,0]) # indirect doctest
1  0  0
0  0  1
0  1
```

Here is what I want to achieve:

* I want **identical** text describing input and output for **all** classes inheriting from `GrowthDiagram`.  That's important, because the whole point of the thing is a common interface.  I only want to provide this text once: somewhere in the class `GrowthDiagram`.

* **additionally**, I want some text that describes the inheriting class.  In particular, this is also the natural place to describe the objects involved and references for the insertion algorithm - not necessarily the growth diagram version.

* **additionally**, I want to display the docstring of some other methods, like `_forward_rule` and `_backward_rule` (these are the natural places to put the reference for the forward and backward rule).

Thus, when I write `GrowthDiagramBinWord?`, I want to see all of the above.

Currently, the generic docstring is not displayed at all!

I think I found a good pattern.  Is the following acceptable to you?  With this I get the complete doc for `Instance1?` whereas `Instance2?` shows the generic doc and the hints.  What I couldn't find out is how to include the doc from, say, `_forward_rule` automatically yet.
`Instance3?` shows the hints twice, but that's OK...

```
class Generic(SageObject):
    """
    Initialise a generalized Schensted growth diagram ...

    INPUT:
    - ``filling``
    ...
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Hints for implementing your own class
        """
        pass

class Instance1(Generic):
    __doc__ = Generic.__doc__
    def __init__(self):
        """
        This is the greatest growth diagram ever
        """
        pass
    def _forward_rule(self, a,b,c):
        """
        Euler invented it
        """
        pass

class Instance2(Generic):
    __doc__ = Generic.__doc__

class Instance3(Generic):

I am quite sure that you misread my proposal - I actually tried it and it works beautifully!

In particular, I **do** achieve locality of documentation - after all, that's why I am trying so hard.

In particular, I certainly do not want to put the reference for the forward rule into the main documentation - but of course I want it visible!  In several classes we have:

* insertion algorithm, discovered by S in 1961
* local rule, described by F in 1995

When implementing or debugging the local rule, you want to look how it is defined mathematically, so the reference and description should be in the docstring of `_forward_rule`!  It would be terrible to have it in the class docstring, then you would have to scroll back and forth all the time.

So the natural thing is to append the doc of `_forward_rule` automatically to the main documentation.  I thought that `.. automethod:` would do this, but it doesn't.

You are basically telling me you want two mutually exclusive things: You want it documented but you don't.

Have multiple windows open of the file. Have one be the html and the other be the text editor. Copy in the rule right where you need it. These are all easy ways to get around that if that is ever a problem that you couldn't remember the rule while working on it.

I disagree if you feel that it should be described at the class-level. Either copy the rule description or just have it at the class-level. The other way is to make `_forward_rule` public (i.e., `forward_rule`).

Let me first repeat that my framework serves two purposes:

1. easy to use
2. easy to extend, even interactively.

Since the definitions involve quite a few conventions, I want that the user sees them when writing his new class.  And no, opening a second window is not an option for this.

I am actually not saying that.  Only those things which must not be changed in inherited classes without destroying the framework.  In particular, input and output.

Apparently, I miscommunicated.  I want it documented at that place where the documentation is needed.

Define what you mean by "extending interactively". Subclasses, passing local rules as input, or something else?

Why not? In fact, your proposal makes things *harder* without a second window for someone doing development because there is no documentation there with other classes or the class you are writing.

I feel like you are either being too precious or you have a code smell.

That is what your proposal in [comment:31](#comment:31) is doing and what I am saying that is not what you want to do. The `__init__` is never visible (unless you are looking at the code). Because they are different classes, they can have different inputs. Hence, you need to copy the input as a way to state they have the same input. There is no output for creating a class.

Do you want the user to be able to call `forward_rule`?

Subclassing the generic class (as in the example above, I am currently writing a better example into the documentation)

On my computer, the docstring of `__init__` becomes visible when I do `Instance2?`.

NO NO NO!  The point of the framework is that the input is always the same!  It allows for extension, but not deviation!

in the docstring of `_forward_rule`: for all of the dozen classes I wrote, I needed the docstring, because in every article the conventions differ.

It might be useful in very rare cases (debugging or trying to find out why the algorithm works, for example).

> Why not?

I was imprecise: searching for the code in another window is not an option, that's what we have `? ` for.  When I have provided a partial implementation of a new growth diagram, I already want that the doc for input and output is already there, and I want to have the implementation hints for the stuff I haven't provided yet.

precious = you are too concerned with making it elegant or a certain way
code smell = indication of a deeper problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)

Actually, I am now convinced that it is a code smell coming from a bad design choice.

It does not appear in the online documentation. However, you are right and it does appear at the bottom (which I am slightly inclined to say it should not, but that is a different issue), which I never noticed. Yet, I say that documentation should not be considered as part of the public API as it does not appear in the built documentation and all other special Python methods are not visible.

Let me be clear, you can not and should not enforce this on any subclass. The input for any subclass can be whatever that subclass wants because it might know better or want to force values for the base class. The moment you want to enforce subclasses to have the same input, you need a different design than subclasses.

Actually, everything you have been telling me what you want a class that takes an "rule" class/function that it uses. (This is called a [strategy design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern).) This (or some close variant) is what we should actually implement.

This is the only real difference, not the classes. This is where the code smell is coming from.

If someone is doing either of those things, then they are looking at the code and know they can call hidden methods. It sounds like it should not be public as it is an implementation detail.

When I have provided a partial implementation of a new growth diagram, I already want that the doc for input and output is already there, and I want to have the implementation hints for the stuff I haven't provided yet.

It should be clear that you are doing something wrong. It is a new class, and so it should have new documentation. However, what you are trying to do is say it is not a new class, but a new rule, which should not be a class.

I will sit down and rework this later today because it needs to be done. The current approach does not scale.

In case you want an example to work with, you could implement the forward rule on from section 3 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.0319.pdf  (Bloom and Saracino)  It is a straightforward modification of the classical rule for Schensted insertion.

Note that this rule is not invertible, so some things cannot work.  But that should certainly not be an obstacle to play with it!

Travis, I took some care that the documentation works now, both in the html version and interactively.

Since the current version is a huge improvement over what's in sage currently, could you have another look whether it's at least "OK"?  Again, I promise to test your idea, too.

I like most of this.  I didn't think of the possibility to pass the things specific to a growth as a class. So, the one thing I absolutely dislike is

```
        sage: Domino = GrowthDiagram.rules.Domino()
        sage: G = GrowthDiagram(Domino, [[0,0,0,-1],[0,0,1,0],[-1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0]]); G
```
Since one usually works only with one specific rule, the invocation should be `GrowDomino([[0,0,0,-1],[0,0,1,0],[-1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0]])`.

I'll have to play a little.

I must say that it is not nice to read this.

That's also a bit strange, because it suggests that my package is badly documented, which is certainly not the case.

Back to technical stuff:

> There are still a few things that need to be done because I didn't know what the best place to put them was (and I'm tired now). In particular, should `P/Q_symbol` be associated to the rule or the growth diagram or both, as well as for `_check_duality`. Let me know what you think.

`P_symbol` should be accessible just as `P_chain`.  The reason it does not exist for all rules is that often there is no special object for it, so the implementation must always be in the rule.

`_check_duality` is only interesting when implementing the rule.  In fact, there may be several interesting local rules for the same pair of dual graded graphs, it only depends on `is_P_edge` and `is_Q_edge`.

`normalize_labels` should certainly have a default implementation.

Does this answer your questions?

Minor thing, in `Rule`:

    All subclasses must provide the following methods:

should be

    All subclasses should provide the following methods:

because it is important that the thing also works (as much as possible) with a partial implementation, and, more importantly, it is important to cover situations which do not quite fit the framework (eg., RSK).

I should first apologize as my wording is misleading. I should have said in the code design. It is not my intention to offend you, and I am sorry if I have. I have written poorly designed code (which I had thought was good or necessary), and I will also write more in the future. I appreciate the code that you have added as it does improve Sage's capabilities and works quite well, and you are.

I do not mean to imply that it was badly documented, but it was lacking good documentation and tests in places.

I will have the `GrowthDiagram.P_symbol` call `rule.P_symbol`.

> `_check_duality` is only interesting when implementing the rule.  In fact, there may be several interesting local rules for the same pair of dual graded graphs, it only depends on `is_P_edge` and `is_Q_edge`.

Okay, this is something that should be done at the `Rule` level.

Just to return the original labels? Every one of your implementations needed to normalize the labels.

Yes, thank you.

Are the optional or mandatory? Your documentation suggests more that they are all mandatory. What methods are needed (for what functionality) and which are recommended?

As for [comment:51](#comment:51), you only need to create the rule once (which you can give a single letter variable). Because of the nature of doctests, we create a lot more of the rule instance than would be necessary in a session.

There are many examples within Sage, but I do not mind doing it.

No, because the class `GrowthDiagram` is the main entry point, whereas `crystals` is a catalog module.

+1 As I mentioned above, I completely agree that we should advertise it as a shorthand method to constructing growth diagrams. However, because of the proposed framework and to be more explicit about what objects are, I do not like `growth_diagrams.RSK()`.

I do not understand at all.  What is surprising about

```
sage: RSKGrowth = GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()
sage: RSKGrowth([2,3,1], shape=[3,2,2])
0  0  1
1  0
0  1
```
in contrast to the following?

```
sage: RSKGrowth = GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK()
sage: GrowthDiagram(RSKGrowth, labels=[[], [1], [2], [1], [], [1], []])
0  0  1
1  0
0  1
```
I find the former actually (slightly) **less** surprising.  In fact, since I use

```
sage: posets.ChainPoset(4)
Finite lattice containing 4 elements
sage: crystals.Letters("A1")
The crystal of letters for type ['A', 1]
sage: groups.permutation.KleinFour()
The Klein 4 group of order 4, as a permutation group
```
I'd actually expect `growthdiagrams.RSK()` - we are providing a catalogue of growth diagrams, aren't we?

So, what do we have to deprecate?  Should I try to run all the old doctests and provide redirections?

It's not a detail, it is the whole thing. They are completely different implementations.

The former is a rule *for* a growth diagram, not a growth diagram. So why would it return a growth diagram? In addition, the entry point for growth diagrams is suppose to be the class `GrowthDiagram`.

We are not. We are providing a catalog of rules to *pass* to `GrowthDiagram`.

If you do a catalog of growth diagrams, then you run right back into most of the same problems that were there before with code/doc locality and separation of concerns. At least, in that argument, doesn't make sense why there should be a separate `Rule` and `GrowthDiagram` class and as I would have the old subclass design. While that could be an improvement over what we currently have in Sage (and was something Anne had suggested to me when we talked briefly about this ticket), it mixes two essentially separate things as growth diagrams are one data structure that uses rules, which gives the growing behavior.

I guess this is a little more complicated. So what we should do is have a function like

```
def GrowthDiagramRSK(filling=None, shape=None, labels=None):
    from sage.misc.superseed import deprecation
    deprecation(23319, "GrowthDiagramRSK is deprecated; use GrowthDiagram with the RSK rule instead")
    return GrowthDiagram(RuleRSK(), filling, shape, labels)
```

OK.  Hopefully final question:

If I understand correctly, you want to remind the user that she is passing a rule to the `GrowthDiagram` class.   Since I am mainly a user, I will go with your opinion even though I do not understand it.

However, I think it makes sense to use the shorthand `X = GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK(); X([1,3,2])` in the tutorial at the beginning and in the individual rule classes.

On the other hand, I'd use the long form `GrowthDiagram(X, [1,3,2])` in the doc of the `GrowthDiagram` class.

So, when advertising the shorthand, how should we call the reference to the rule:

```
sage: RSKGrowth = GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK(); RSKGrowth([1,3,2])
sage: RSKRule = GrowthDiagram.rules.RSK(); RSKRule([1,3,2])
```
(I think it's important to use good names for variables in a tutorial, to get the right mindset across ... although I admit that the difference here is perhaps marginal.)

PS: it's nice to hear that you talked with Anne about the package.  I hope she likes it!  Please let her know that I can't wait for #20041 and #22921 :-)

Thank you.

I would say it should come at the end of the tutorial only as it is a shorthand, but if you want to include it after the main way, then I probably will not object.

Clearly the latter as the former is misleading at best. It is the rule for the growth diagram, the latter suggests that it is a growth diagram.

From my conversion with her, it seems like we will have to get those tickets done in order to get them into Sage. I hope to find some time to do that, but I have a few higher priority things to do first. :/

This is the only outstanding issue. This is the thing that needs more documentation, and I do not feel I understand the code enough to do it to the precision you want.

Travis, some of your documentation changes make me **very** unhappy.  Some changes in the code make me unhappy.

1. I took great care to strike a balance between the shorthand and `GrowthDiagram(Rule, stuff)`.  I feel ignored here.  Although there are some cases where one may want to use different rules, most of the time there is only one rule around.  This is also visible from Anne's comment.  Please revert this.

2. The point of the `RulePascal` example in the tutorial is now completely destroyed.  Please revert this, too.

3. The docstring template for the forward rule is there for a reason - it tells you the conventions at a glance.  Please leave this in.  Alternatively, provide an abstract method with this docstring, and doctest it with `help(RulePascal.forward_rule)` at this point.

4. rather minor: I learned in school that, when writing English, sentences (and half-sentences) after a colon start in lowercase - has this changed?

5. in the deprecation warnings, I took care to point the reader directly to the new entry point.  While a minor issue, `use GrowthDiagram with the YoungFibonacci rule instead` is not really helpful.

I just see that I should take back item 2 in [comment:76](#comment:76) - I didn't see from the commit that you incrementally add to the minimal implementation.  Please excuse.

My original intention was to stress that one can implement a growth diagram with very little information, and very little typing.

Your changes introduced some mistakes though: in line 272 `backward_rule` makes no sense - unless we show that it won't work anymore as written.  In line 295 it must be deleted, too, the good version appears 5 lines below.

I think that 1 and 3 are blockers, however.  Advertising it like this seems completely wrong to me.

I would have thought that the `RulePascal` example in the tutorial and `RuleRSK` show that these methods are, in some sense, all "optional".  Where does my documentation suggest that they would be mandatory?

I didn't want to explicitely list what is needed for which functionality.  Let me try:

* `P_graph` needs `vertices`, `is_P_edge` and `has_multiple_edges`
* `_check_duality` needs `P_graph` and `Q_graph`
* `MyRule(filling)` needs `forward_rule`, `zero` and `has_multiple_edges`
* `MyRule(labels=good_labels, shape=shape)` needs `backward_rule`, `zero` and `has_multiple_edges`, if you provide the labels normalized, that is, as used by `backward_rule`
* `MyRule(labels=good_labels)` additionally needs `rank` to guess the shape

One may be tempted to separate `vertices`, `P_graph` and `_check_duality` from the rest.  However, combining them actually helps with implementing a "proof-of-concept".  For example, if the dual graded graph is easy to implement, I can do `assert is_P_edge(y, e, t)` in `forward_rule` to catch silly mistakes.  When the rank is easy, I can abort early in `is_P_edge`, etc.

An observation: for consistency, `has_multiple_edges` should be `has_multiedges` - as in graphs.

Although there are some cases where one may want to use different rules, most of the time there is only one rule around.  This is also visible from Anne's comment.  Please revert this.

I was not trying to ignore you; I did not know that was what you were trying to do as you didn't say that was your goal previously. However, I disagree with a number of them because the main entry point and object is `GrowthDiagram`. So I prefer to emphasize this over the shorthand. I do not want to put words in Anne's mouth, but I believe her comment was about the previous implementation as a way to address your documentation issues.

Also, to directly offer a counterpoint, each of the different crystals has a completely different data structure, whereas all growth diagrams have the same data structure. Perhaps a very good analogy is the tableaux crystal, which have specific rules for types ABCD. These are implemented in essentially the same way as the current implementation: the main entry point is `crystals.Tableaux` (i.e., `CrystalOfTableaux`) where the "rule" is the Cartan type that then is translated into a specific `CrystalOfLetters` subclass.

In this case, we can do some preparsing of the input to make things a little easier, but one could just as easily pass a `CartanType` object. For the growth diagram rules, I would have string inputs to specify the rule. Yet, the LLMS rule would need an additional argument, and I felt it was cleaner to do things this way.

It has too much of a feeling of forcing people to have the same docstring. There are plenty of examples with the other rules already implemented, and IMO we do not need an `@abstract_method(optional=True)` method because we (will) explain what is needed in the documentation.

> 4. rather minor: I learned in school that, when writing English, sentences (and half-sentences) after a colon start in lowercase - has this changed?

My understanding is that it depends on whether what comes after the colon and how much emphasis you want to put on what follows. Although you have most likely learned the formal rule.

> 5. in the deprecation warnings, I took care to point the reader directly to the new entry point.  While a minor issue, `use GrowthDiagram with the YoungFibonacci rule instead` is not really helpful.

The main entry point (and object) is and should be `GrowthDiagram`. I am expanding a bit more on that documentation because it is the main entry point (you do not get the module-level doc interactively).

> I hope I pointed out that `RuleRSK` is not a pair of local rules in the sense of Fomin.

I think of it as all of the necessary information necessary to define a growth diagram.

Indeed. I will add in the stuff from [comment:79](#comment:79) into the `Rule` class documentation.

No problem.

I understood that from looking at the tutorial, but it was done in a way that suggested constructing things by monkey-patching, which is something that should be avoided.

That was the `backward_rule` that was being used at that point, but now it is just there explicitly. If it is wrong, which was no way clear to me, then more information is needed in the tutorial.

Well, for me it isn't.  Possibly it is for developing new rules, and for first-timers, but certainly not for somebody using growth diagrams the second time.

> It has too much of a feeling of forcing people to have the same docstring.

I like being reminded of the order of the arguments and the direction of the growth, since there is a dozen natural ways to do it.  So, if I put it into the docstring right away, I don't have to remember it, and I don't even need to remember where to look it up.

If you do that, then you've lost me completely.  In fact, I'm close to quitting sage development entirely after this experience.  I'm exhausted.

> The main entry point (and object) is and should be GrowthDiagram.

Can you please acknowledge that we disagree here, and that it is still possible to coexist.

> I am expanding a bit more on that documentation because it is the main entry point (you do not get the module-level doc interactively).

Yes, I consider this a bug.  I use the following as a workaround:

```
sage: import sage.combinat.growth
sage: sage.combinat.growth?
```

> That was the backward_rule that was being used at that point, but now it is just there explicitly. If it is wrong, which was no way clear to me, then more information is needed in the tutorial.

You shouldn't have deleted the docstring.  There it clearly shows that, in the case of multiedges, five arguments are needed.

Let me summarise what I'd be OK with.

1. Concerning long versus short form:
   * in the module level documentation, and all the individual rules, use the long version once and then the shorthand consistently.
   * in the documentation for `GrowthDiagram`, always use the long version.

2. As the oversight with the backward rule in the introductory example shows, it is a good idea to have this docstring there.

I am not saying we should do that. Let me also clarify, I would have something like `GrowthDiagram("RSK", labels)` be equivalent to `GrowthDiagram(RuleRSK, labels)`.

I am also exhausted with this and ready to go to other code.

Yes, I have.

This is not a bug at all but a specification of Python.

I feel that is unfair to me as it was your example and you are the expert in this area. IMO, it is a shortcoming/problem of the tutorial that needs to be addressed, and I do not have the expertise to correct it.

I disagree. It is distracting from the tutorial, doesn't really explain why the method was wrong, and too much of an imposition on the developer.

Hi Darij!  Thank you for reading!

> - line 67: "the 36 cells of this matrix" seems to refer to the example on lines 49-54, not that on lines 62-64.

Moved the shorthand into a new section "Invocation".

> Even so, are you sure it assigns partitions to the 36 cells of the matrix? IMHO it assigns integers to the 36 cells of the matrix, but assigns partitions to the 49 intersections of grid lines.

That's correct.  The text is: "assigns partitions to the corners of each of the 36 cells of the matrix".  No idea how to clarify further :-(

> - lines 113-128: This example should probably be explained better. What exactly does `labels` do? Does it determine the partitions along the western and northern borders? Is the growth really still working on a full 6x6 grid, rather than on some Young-ish portion of it?

I agree with "clarification needed".  Please check.

Yes, but I was afraid of writing this.  I tried a compromise using a parenthetical remark, please check.

I also switched to using american english consistently (using a spellchecker), I adopted consistent parameter names for the forward and backward rules.

I hope it's OK now.

I was implementing a pair of dual graphs, and had a bug.  To make debugging easier, I made the message in `_check_duality` better.  To do so, I also had to be consistent with "up in P and down in Q".  To understand that, I added a remark on duality.

Apart from that, I removed a parenthesis.

If it's OK, please go ahead and set it to positive (finally :-)

If you dislike the more verbose error message, you can remove it, modify it, whatever you like!

Wonderful!

I have yet another example ready - although without forward and backward rule because I don't know them: Dual graded graphs for (skew) quasisymmetric Schur functions. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04614v1.pdf.

I have the graphs, and the conversion from a saturated chain in the P-graph to a `CompositionTableaux`.

Could you please confirm that it's better to put this in another ticket?

Or should I push?
