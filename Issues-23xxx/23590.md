The following has changed since Sage 7.2.

```
sage: sorted([1,2,'a'])
['a', 1, 2]
sage: sorted([1r,2r,'a'])
[1, 2, 'a']
```
I think that these should have the same result (matching the Python `int` behavior, since we can change `Integer` comparison more easily).

Yes, but we aren't on Python 3 yet, so it's still changed behavior compared to the past for the current version of Sage.

I'm mostly with Frédéric on this one. I don't think it is worth spending time worrying about how `int` and `Integer` compare with strings (well...hopefully `Integer` will be consistent with `int` when we go to Python3).

+1, this comparison is pointless anyway.
