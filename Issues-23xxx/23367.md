There are two such cases, for named matrix groups and for named permutation groups. I think that we want them to compare equal to some group that has the same generators, but is not itself given a name. This forces to bypass the `UniqueRepresentation` comparison. I do not understand what your proposal with super is doing, sorry.

With `super(UniqueRepresentation, self)`, we explicitly say that we want the `__richcmp__` method from whatever class comes after `UniqueRepresentation` in the Method Resolution Order (MRO). So the behaviour is the same, but it's a lot more robust.

I believe this breaks some of the current behavior:

```
return super(UniqueRepresentation, self).__eq__(other)
```
As I understand the old version, it compares generator by generator. You are almost correct about the comparison, but not quite. The old code compares equal two groups `G == Gp` if `Gp` has the same generators but is created as a subgroup of a different group than `G` (including if either one is not considered as a subgroup). So your change removes this equality, in addition to groups with different names but same generators, as being `True` as it just falls back on the `UniqueRepresentation` behavior (well, technically `WithEqualityById`).

However, because it only overrides `__eq__`, you can also get equal and not-equal groups:

```
sage: G = groups.matrix.GL(4,2)
sage: H = MatrixGroup(G.gens())
sage: G == H
True
sage: G != H
True
```
So I think the best way forward is to change `UniqueRepresentation` to `CachedRepresentation` and implement `__richcmp__`.
