Implement a fallback rootfinder that looks for roots in the polynomial base ring and filters the ones belonging to a subring, in order to make things like

```
sage: Pols.<x> = QQ[]
sage: ((x^2 - 1/2)*(x^2 - 1)).roots(ZZ)
[(1, 1), (-1, 1)]
```
work.

It is better to call `self.roots()` with the value of `multiplicities` with which we were called, because `roots()` might be implemented only in the case `multiplicities=False` (though that's unlikely over exact rings). And I found it clearer to write the loop that follows as

Wouldn't that be redundant? What `is_subring()` does is check that the “natural map” between the two rings is injective, and `sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic` defines the natural map as the coercion morphism (if there is one).

Most coercion morphisms don't have an explicit section, even when the satisfy the requirements I'm setting here. For example, `sage: QQ['x'].coerce_map_from(ZZ).section()` is `None`.

Indeed, `is_subring` alone should do the job!

I'm not a miracle, but maybe I can help to have this ticket go ahead. Indeed, it's a pity that the implementation of a `section` method is rarely done. I can offer support at this point:

I've created a ticket #27081 for the implementation of a `section` method for composite maps. This would cover the example `QQ['x'].coerce_map_from(ZZ).section()` above.

My feeling is, that in general the overhead to implement `section` is to high. This maybe the reason, that it is missing in many situations where it could be obtained easily from an existing method, for example the `lift` method of GAP group homomorphism (I recently did that in ticket #26750).

Other examples where a section as a python function exist, but is not used to implement `section` are `_element_constructor_` methods of a natural map's domain. An example for this are coercion maps between number fields:

```
sage: CF3 = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: CF9 = CyclotomicField(9)
sage: PCF9.<v> = CF9[]
sage: p = v**9 -1
sage: p.roots(CF3)
[(1, 1), (zeta3, 1), (-zeta3 - 1, 1)]
sage: emb = CF9.coerce_map_from(CF3)
sage: emb.section() is None
True
```

This example is working with this ticket, but would not work if `section` would be used. But, in this case a `section` method could be obtained easily from the element construction.

My suggestion to have sections being implemented more easily is the following:

1. Implement new generic methods `_section_function` in `sage.categories.map.Map` and `_natural_map_section_function` in `sage.structure.parent.Parent` such that they `return None` by default.

2. Extend the class `Section` (or implement a special subclass for that purpose) such that the supported python function can be used in its `_call_` method.

3. In `section` look if the new methods (according to 1.) support functions to obtain a section. If so, return an instance of `Section` (according to 2.).

I offer to work on such an enhancement, if you consider it to be reasonable!
