```
On a particular server, doing the long doctests of `src/sage/rings/padics/padic_base_leaves.py`:

- Sage 8.0.beta9: `[142 tests, 202.82 s]`

- Sage 8.0.beta10: `[191 tests, 626.31 s]`

The test time in Sage 8.0.beta10 is simply too much (but the number of tests has increased since 8.0.beta9, so this is probably not a regression). This is a problem because it leads to timeouts when running doctests.

I investigated the first regression and it is due to MPIR-3.0.0: #23327

I will change this ticket to be only about the second issue: the large absolute time taken by testing `padic_base_leaves.py`
