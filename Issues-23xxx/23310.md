I suspect a large number of the problems come from the fact that `BooleanPolynomialRing` inherits from `MPolynomialRing_generic`, which makes (natural) assumptions that each variable is free. I'd guess there are probably a number of other methods that suffer from similar fates.

There are a few more problems due to the inheritance. `construction` looks wrong

```
sage: B.<a> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: F, Q = B.construction()
sage: F(Q)
Univariate Polynomial Ring in a over Finite Field of size 2 (using NTL)
sage: _ is B
False
```
as is the Krull dimension, which should be 0

```
sage: B.krull_dimension()
1
```
but other methods look OK.

There some errors in the categories `B` is placed in.  For example

```
sage: B in IntegralDomains
True
sage: a * (1+a)
0
```
There are zero divisors, so `B` is certainly not an Integral Domain.

```
sage: B in PrincipalIdealDomains
True
```
It is true that all ideals of `B` are principal, but as it is not a domain it is not a PID.
