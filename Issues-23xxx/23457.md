It should be possible to do

```
P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
P(infinity)
```
and get back the point at infinity

Please add doctests for

```

P(Infinity)
P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)

Thank you. So with the error something wierd happens. - The error type changes when I try a second time in my terminal:

```
sage: P=ProjectiveSpace(QQ,2)
sage: P.point(Infinity)
...
NotImplementedError: please implement `_an_element_` for Set of rational points of Projective Space of dimension 2 over Rational Field

sage: P.point(Infinity)
...

ValueError: +Infinity not well defined in dimension > 1
```

Can you reproduce this? Though the doctest runs fine.

It just has nontrivial indeterminacy (or is the constant map depending on how you think about it). By using that simple lame construction I was able to keep `_an_element_`() simple.

The problem with trying to use the identity map is what about the following situation where there is no identity map

```
P2 = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 2)
P3 = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 3)
Q = Hom(P2,P3)
```

My version still works...

The docstring of says that 

```
OUTPUT:

   The homspace of all homomorphisms from "self" to "codomain" in the
   category "category".
```
Our category is the "Category of schemes over Rational Field".
The thing you defined is a rational map which is not a morphism of schemes. 
If I am not mistaken, it is possible that the homset between two schemes is empty.
For this consider a scheme S over QQ without rational points and the homset Hom(Spec(QQ),S). It is empty.

My understanding is that the category of schemes in sage uses rational maps as its morphisms.

I'm not saying this is right or wrong, but it would be a major task and change of philosophy for schemes. At the very least there should be a discussion on sage-devel about this and would be a separate ticket (or many separate tickets)

You're point about possibly empty homsets is valid. For example, this code fails for

```
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ, 1)
X=P.subscheme(x^2+2*y^2)
X(QQ)._an_element_()
```
Not sure what to do about `_an_element_`() if the homset is empty...
