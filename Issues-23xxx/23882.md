new:

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit [x for x in S.__iter__()]
10 loops, best of 3: 85.1 ms per loop
```
old:

```
sage: %timeit [x for x in S.__iter__()]
1 loop, best of 3: 320 ms per loop

sage: A = [x for x in S.__iter_new__()]
sage: B = [x for x in S.__iter__()]
sage: A == B
True
```
The reason is that `S.__iter__` checked `self._element_constructor is tuple`, but this attribute was renamed to `_build`.

The ticket description is misleading: You are not introducing a new method `__iter_new__`, but you change the existing `__iter__` method to make it faster, and test the old versus the new version.

In particular, Vincent, there should be no new doctest, as the result of iteration should remain the same (as will be tested in all existing doctests that do `for x in S`).

Do we really want to doctest an implementation detail?  I guess the right thing to do would be to have a test that takes forever with the old implementation and is fast with the new one...

One shouldn't use private/magic double underscore methods directly in the tests. Examples shouldn't too much depend on implementation details, but tests may depend on implementation. Anyway, I think one doesn't need to change the existing tests here.

To make the speed comparison clearer: Old version is (on my laptop)

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit L = list(S)
10 loops, best of 3: 33.8 ms per loop
```
New version is

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit L = list(S)
100 loops, best of 3: 9.42 ms per loop
```

The change looks good to me, provided that the doctests all pass.
