new:

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit [x for x in S.__iter__()]
10 loops, best of 3: 85.1 ms per loop
```
old:

```
sage: %timeit [x for x in S.__iter__()]
1 loop, best of 3: 320 ms per loop

sage: A = [x for x in S.__iter_new__()]
sage: B = [x for x in S.__iter__()]
sage: A == B
True
```
The reason is that `S.__iter__` checked `self._element_constructor is tuple`, but this attribute was renamed to `_build`.

The ticket description is misleading: You are not introducing a new method `__iter_new__`, but you change the existing `__iter__` method to make it faster, and test the old versus the new version.

One shouldn't use private/magic double underscore methods directly in the tests. Examples shouldn't too much depend on implementation details, but tests may depend on implementation. Anyway, I think one doesn't need to change the existing tests here.

To make the speed comparison clearer: Old version is (on my laptop)

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit L = list(S)
10 loops, best of 3: 33.8 ms per loop
```
New version is

```
sage: S = Subwords([randint(1,10) for i in range(100)], 3, element_constructor=tuple)
sage: %timeit L = list(S)
100 loops, best of 3: 9.42 ms per loop
```

The change looks good to me, provided that the doctests all pass.
