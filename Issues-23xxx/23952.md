In the wake of #23671, a meta-ticket to record some proposed improvements to hypergeometric motives. Please add suggestions to this list, and make individual tickets for individual changes.

- Euler factors at tame primes. These are implemented in Magma and involve Jacobi motives (#29040).
- Euler factors at wild primes. This is rather complicated.
- Good Euler factors for parameter in a number field.
- Optimizations to speed up `padic_H_value`. Some occur at #24433 (cache coefficients of the Dwork exponential series) and #28458 (eliminate redundant Gauss sum calls).
- Recode the computation of Gauss sums and/or the hypergeometric trace formula in Cython. (See #28902, #29893.)
- Speed up possible_hypergeometric_data for fixed weight. (See #23953 for one step: returning an iterator instead of a list.)
- Add the computation of the Frobenius structure on the hypergeometric equation, which can be more efficient than the trace formula when the degree is large.
- Refactor: should this really be under `modular`?

Keywords: **hypergeometric motives**
