As this question on [ask.sagemath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/37964/hermite-form-entries-reduced-over-pivots/) shows, presently we have:

```
sage: R.<x>=QQ[]
sage: M=matrix(2,2,[x,x,0,x]);
sage: M.hermite_form()

[x x]
[0 x]
```
we see that the pivot column doesn't get further reduced. According to `M._echelon_form_PID` this would be done if the relevant ideals have a `small_residue` method.

Component: **linear algebra**
