One product of Jeffery Hein's PhD thesis is some impressive C++ code for computing Hecke operators on spaces of modular forms, based on a method of Birch involving reduction of ternary quadratic forms. Besides being very fast, the code produces sparse integer matrices for individual Atkin-Lehner eigenspaces.

The code is available at

https://github.com/jefferyphein/ternary-birch

and it would be great to get it into Sage. This might require some better packaging on the upstream end, but for now I'm focusing on building a working Cython wrapper. I have some progress on that, but I'm new to the Cython/C++ interaction and that is holding things up.

I see that this package uses SCons unfortunately. I personally hate SCons because it is much less portable than other alternatives. We used to have a few packages in Sage using SCons, but we either got rid of them or we ported them to a different build system. Besides that, there is also the simple fact that SCons is not shipped with Sage. Luckily, the package is simple enough, so porting to autotools should not be too hard.

We may be able to get some help from upstream if it comes to that. Anyway, the purpose of this ticket is just the wrapper; I plan to open another ticket regarding packaging later if we get that far.

I've attached a working wrapper to Hein's code. The code itself may be of some independent interest besides what I've exposed (e.g., for dealing with quaternion algebras), but I'm not sure if it can easily be made 32-bit-safe. (This has been an issue with incorporating other packages; see for instance #965.)

By the way, the publicly available reference for Birch's method is Birch's 1991 article "Hecke actions on classes of ternary quadratic forms".

Quick update: in light of the deprecation warnings, I changed the pragmas to use distutils.

This currently "works" in the following sense: if I put `hein_wrapper.pyx` in the same folder as the Hein code, then running `load("hein_wrapper.pyx")` works in Sage 8.2. However, I haven't thought at all about packaging this to actually build as part of Sage.
