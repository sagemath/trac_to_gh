I'll make a commit shortly. It is a review commit, but the following issues remain:

- The shorthand Travis suggested above (comment:6).

- Multi-basis support (comment:7).

- A reference to any source that uses modern notation (e.g., Grinberg/Reiner Chapter 8).

- For reasons of speed: use sum_of_terms or sum_of_monomials instead of sum in the constructors of the three operations?

- For reasons of speed: don't we have lower-level shuffle iterators that avoid the detour through the `Word` class?

Thanks for working on that. I am not very positive about using << and >> for the dendriform operations. I think we must live with the fact that there are too many operations to assign a symbol to each of them.

I made a few changes beyond the naming.

- I added Darij to the authors and copyright.
- I changed the implementation of `to_symmetric_group_algebra` because SGA's form a natural tower of R-algebras. Since this is just a R-linear embedding, it makes perfect sense to use the maximal degree (and the behavior you allowed did not match your doc).
- Some minor documentation/formatting changes.

If my changes are good, then positive review.

Nice extension of `to_symmetric_group_algebra`, although I'm not sure how useful it will be (it's not an embedding anymore). BUT this part:

```
+            if not self:
+                return SymmetricGroupAlgebra(self.base_ring(), 0).zero()
```
should be

```
            if not self:
                if n is None:
                    n = 0
                return SymmetricGroupAlgebra(self.base_ring(), n).zero()

instead.
