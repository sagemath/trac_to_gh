As per #22509, `DESTDIR` is useful in the cases where the build process needs to hard-code `--prefix` paths in the build output. For example, embedded rpaths. This is not only useful but vital for binary distros who can't write to /usr during a build.

It's less important - and one can get away with only supporting `--prefix` - if the build does not embed these paths. However nowadays `DESTDIR` is a common standard, so it's good to support it regardless.

Since Sage 8.0 currently does not support DESTDIR (and neither did previous versions) I have to carry the following patch in Debian. It would be technically unnecessary after DESTDIR support is introduced, however in Debian we also have a policy to avoid rpath if possible.

Even disregarding Debian, there is no particular reason for Sage to go embedding rpaths in its binaries, it prevents SAGE_LOCAL from being moved to different places around the filesystem. AFAICS, no other part of Sage involves embedding build paths, and one can freely move a SAGE_LOCAL around after applying this patch.

There have been many discussions in the past about this... I don't know much about dynamic linking myself, but I do know that there are reasons why Sage uses rpaths.

At least this ticket should be discussed on sage-devel.

Having an experience on HPC and various package managers which build software stack on top on an OS I fall heavily in the rpath camp. No solution to this problem is 100% perfect, but rpath now does it for me. Sage as a software stack falls in that category. This is of course different from the \"sagelib\" component itself, which should be free to have a life independent of the sage packaging system.",

You can use `sage-env` for that but really during the build of "sagelib" most thing are coming from `sage/env.py`. Those value can be overridden by the environment which is the main reason my ebuild has the following section

```
	export SAGE_LOCAL="${EPREFIX}"/usr
	export SAGE_ROOT=`pwd`/..
	export SAGE_SRC=`pwd`
	export SAGE_ETC=`pwd`/bin
	export SAGE_DOC=`pwd`/build_doc

	export SAGE_DOC_MATHJAX=yes
	export VARTEXFONTS="${T}"/fonts

`pwd` in that context is the `src` folder from the sage tarball. The build takes its cues from there.

Otherwise I agree with Jeroen. A flip back of this magnitude has to be discussed on sage-devel. Having an experience on HPC and various package managers which build software stack on top on an OS I fall heavily in the rpath camp. No solution to this problem is 100% perfect, but rpath now does it for me. Sage as a software stack falls in that category. This is of course different from the "sagelib" component itself, which should be free to have a life independent of the sage packaging system.
