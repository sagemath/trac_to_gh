because the function that is supposed to provide the information is itself crashing.

When starting sage with python3.6, sage crashes immediately. The crash report ends up with

TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```
This is not the source of the crash. But the function supposed to provide information on the origin of the crash is itself crashing because `docstring` is of type `str` when `bytes` is required.

The code is in `_sage_getdoc_unformatted` (`docstring` is the return value of this function)

```
    # Check if the __doc__ attribute was actually a string, and
    # not a 'getset_descriptor' or similar.
    if not isinstance(r, string_types):
        return ''
    elif isinstance(r, unicode):
        return r.encode('utf-8', 'ignore')
    else:
        return r
```
For things to work properly I currently invert the last two returns call. It is probably sub-optimal. But after that operation the crash report works and give us the real reason sage crashed in the first place.

I don't understand half the problems you have building with python3. sage-on-gentoo just builds out of the box with python3.6. That being said your problem is with `package.py` which in sage-on-gentoo I replace with a shorter version https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/sage/files/sage-7.3-package.py this is because from the point of view of sage-on-gentoo the sage "library" has no business in package management and what's left is solely to make patching minimal in other areas of the sage code.

I do not mess anything just to get python3 to build (apart from pynac for side by side python install), if there is something helping that's just a side effect.

I guess you have the same kind of issue python3 must expect stdout to be bytes when in python2 it was made a nice string.
