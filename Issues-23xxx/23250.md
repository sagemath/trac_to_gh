Sometimes when doing a parallel build on Cygwin, the Singular build will fail if it tries to build the "pyobject" module before Python itself has finished building.

Because all symbols must be resolved at link time when building shared modules on Windows, this will fail on Windows but not on other platforms (especially if they already happen to have the Python headers on their system which most Sage developers will).
