<div id="comment:9" align="right">comment:9</div>

Inserting at the beginning of a list repeatedly is more expensive than inserting at the end and then reversing (it has to bump each entry back every time you insert). Granted, at this scale it may not be a big issue.

Somewhere between paranoia and it makes the code easier to parse:

```diff
-            force_multivariate = (len(old) == 1) and is_MPolynomialRing(R)
+            force_multivariate = ((len(old) == 1) and is_MPolynomialRing(R))
```

Is there a definitive reason to force the multivariate polynomial ring? I know you're not changing the current implementation, but I'm just wondering if that is something that is necessary since the univariates tend to be more powerful. If you don't know, then we can just leave it as is.

LGTM otherwise.
