<div id="comment:0"></div>

Currently, the defining polynomial of a p-adic extension always has coefficients over the base ring:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: W.<w> = Zp(5).extension(x^2 - 5)
sage: W.defining_polynomial().base_ring()
5-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
```

This is fine, one would expect the defining polynomial to have coefficients in the base ring but we would also like to have access to the exact polynomial. To make this consistent, we should always keep two polynomials: a defining polynomial and an exact polynomial.

The defining polynomial has coefficients over the base ring. It is not part of the key used in the factory as it can be recovered from the exact polynomial.

The exact polynomial has coefficients in a number field: For extension of !Zp/Qp, the coefficients are in QQ. For two step extensions, the coefficients are in the absolute number field defined by the exact polynomial of the base ring. For more general extensions, the coefficients are in the tower of number fields, defined by the exact polynomials.

The exact polynomial is part of the key used in the factory. Two fields with different exact polynomial but same defining polynomial are different. This makes sense because they behave differently with respect to `change()` when changing the precision.

For extensions constructed from a modulus with inexact coefficients (in the base ring) we just set the exact polynomial to an approximation of the modulus.

Depends on #20073

Awesome! Some comments through:
- Why did you implement only `exact_field` and not `exact_ring` (for p-adic rings)?
- Shouldn't we have a coercion map from the exact subfield/subring to the p-adic field/ring?
- I would say that the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` should both by default return a polynomial defined over the p-adic field and accept an attribute specifying whether the user wants an exact defining polynomial (I believe that having different behaviour for these two methods is quite confusing).

Replying to [@xcaruso](#comment%3A5):
> Awesome! Some comments through:
> - Why did you implement only `exact_field` and not `exact_ring` (for p-adic rings)?

Two reasons:
1. We didn't need it for this ticket
2. Eventually, exact rings would require computing rings of integers in number fields, or at least p-maximal orders.  We don't want to solve a hard computational problem problem to do something trivial.

> - Shouldn't we have a coercion map from the exact subfield/subring to the p-adic field/ring?

Yes.  I'll add this to the the followup ticket #23471

> - I would say that the methods `modulus` and `defining_polynomial` should both by default return a polynomial defined over the p-adic field and accept an attribute specifying whether the user wants an exact defining polynomial (I believe that having different behaviour for these two methods is quite confusing).

I had a conversation with Julian, Marc and Rob and we agree.

> - Shouldn't we check that the precision of the defining polynomial is enough to well-defined extension (thanks to Krasner's Lemma)?

Yes, but I think that this should be saved for a followup ticket #23480 (Julian has code for doing this, but it depends on the MacLane package).

I don't unserstand why implementing `exact_ring` would require something more than just calling `ZZ.extension(...)` that creates the order in a number field defined by the given polynomial. We do not care if it is not the maximal order, don't we?

Is it in it? (I ask the question because this ticket is not marked as a dependency of #23471.)
