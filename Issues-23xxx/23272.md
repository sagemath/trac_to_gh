On purchasing a new laptop, I attempted to MAKE sage as I normally have and ran into the following error:

```
Error building Sage. 

The following package(s) may have failed to build (not necessarily during this run of 'make all'):

* package: openblas-0.2.19.p0 
  log file: /sage/sage/logs/pkgs/openblas-0.2.19.p0.log
  build directory: /sage/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/openblas-0.2.19.p0
```

The error seemed to be really coming from:

```
make[3]: *** [getarch_2nd] Error 1
Makefile:123: *** OpenBLAS: Detecting CPU failed. Please set TARGET explicitly, e.g. make TARGET=your_cpu_target. Please read README for the detail..  Stop.
make[3]: Leaving directory '/sage/sage/local/var/tmp/sage/build/openblas-0.2.19.p0/src'
Error building OpenBLAS
```


It turned out that this error has been seen multiple times in Sage:
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/zQsZsivts0I
* https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-release/3QJoAgg9bgo
* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/FhPQS_R_CTA/g-yQFXXzAgAJ

* https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/JtDS2kHafAA/DWdHpWPxAgAJ

etc.

I noticed that updating the config (as mentioned in the threads above) accurately solved the problem, but I wanted to try and fix the problem head on rather than just temporarily solve it. With that in mind, I conversed with the OpenBLAS people:
https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/1204
and they suggested I update the cpu file for the build, which I have included.

Additionally, I wanted to fix this problem for future users and thus I wanted to add a fail-safe for the code so that if this error happens again, then we automatically try the TARGET=ATOM method. But, I want to create this with the caveat that a user can change the method.



Before finalizing these changes, we should note a few things, but as I've not worked that long with sage I don't know how to address them. In essence:

- Are the changes I made appropriate for the make?
- I'm adding documentation on this as there is no documentation.
- There was questions on why we have "p0" at the end of our version? I assume this is from the patch, but I don't know. 
- The programmer suggested we change the " top level option to use -lblas (debian/ubuntu) -lopenblas (suse/fedora/epel)". I don't know what that means in regards to us, but figured someone might be able to answer this question and maybe we can ensure this is happening.

If there are any questions feel free to ask, and if you believe this is not necessarily or if something else is better practice, let me know. I've never done a bash alteration so not sure what the details for that.

<div id="comment:5" align="right">Comment 5</div>

We discussed a bit. In the long run, we would like OpenBlas to provide a short mantra
to configure itself with "use Atom by default if target unavailable".

For now, I wondered about separating somewhat more the configuration part from the compilation, by adding a new dependency in OpenBlas makefile like:

```
    is_architecture_available:
         <here the logic from the beginning of the `libs` dependency
```

and then, in spkg-install / spkg-check do first a call to

```
    make is_architecture_available
```
do the additional logic if needed, and then just call make as usual.

Just throwing ideas in the air; not sure this is the right thing to do.

Insights anyone?

So the reason we are just guessing "ATOM" is because that was the recommended fall-back by the openblas team. (You can see the conversation I had in the link I posted)

THe problem with just letting the build fail is that as new computers come out with new CPUs these CPUs will not be included in the openblas config which tests against CPU. In other words all future computers will start having problems when new CPUs get introduced. Since OpenBLAS doesn't update regularly, we can't rely on us to "remember" every time a new CPU gets released.

The point of this ticket is to upgrade the openblas script through a patch so that new CPUs that have been added in the last year will now properly be able to get a target. Additionally, it will protect us for future CPUs by defaulting to ATOM until we get an update to OpenBLAS.

Note that the version is already `0.2.19.p0` so I've let it as is.

Typo: OpenBAS -> OpenBLAS

I agree that it would be best if OpenBLAS would just default to something sensible if it can't detect the CPU. But, unless thats implemented, we should just try a second time with TARGET=ATOM. I'd prefer if we just unconditionally try that a second time and not rely on the spelling of the logged error message, or the location of the log file.

OpenBLAS 0.2.20 should be released really soon now...

POWER:

        * Optimizations for Power9

        * Fixed several Power8 assembly bugs

....
x86_64:

This isn't going to work for a number reasons; for one the log files are usually appended to so this will be true for builds that failed but then later succeeded if the log files were not deleted first.

Better to explicitly tee the configure command to a separate log file and grep that.

sage 8.1.beta7 didn't compile on a debian box with a kaby lake i7-7500U CPU, because of the 'missing target' openblas error.
