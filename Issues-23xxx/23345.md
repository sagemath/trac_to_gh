This is way too slow. Those functions are called *a lot* in the coercion framework, so they should be as fast as possible. In Cython, checking `isinstance(x, Fraction)` is about a factor 30 slower than `isinstance(x, float)`!

I could live with an exact type check like

```
from fractions import Fraction
cdef type FractionType = <type>Fraction

...
   if type(x) is FractionType:
...
```
Of course, this won't work with subclasses. I don't know how important that is.
