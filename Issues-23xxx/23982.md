Perfect matchings are special set partitions, therefore they should inherit from those.  As a side effect, perfect matchings have a good hashing function now.

This opens the opportunity to provide crossings and nestings for set partitions, and do some cleaning.

Old description:

Perfect matchings are not "normalised", that is, the pairs are not sorted.  Although that's sometimes annoying it's OK, because equality works.

However, there is a problem with containment:

```
sage: M = PerfectMatching([(2, 3), (4, 1)]); M
[(2, 3), (4, 1)]
sage: M in PerfectMatchings(4)
True
sage: set(PerfectMatchings(4))
{[(1, 2), (3, 4)], [(1, 3), (2, 4)], [(1, 4), (2, 3)]}
sage: M in set(PerfectMatchings(4))
False
```
This is because the set containment is done using the hash, and the hash is computed as the hash of the list representation of the matching.  The list representation of the matching is not sorted, so the hashes of `[(2, 3), (4, 1)]` and `[(1, 4), (2, 3)]` are different.

If so, I still think that this should be done when the matching is created.  I think that this would minimize the overhead.

But I'm not quite sure how to do it correctly - should I do it as in `SetPartition`?  I don't understand why `SetPartition` inherits from `ClonableArray` whereas `PerfectMatching` inherits from `ElementWrapper`.

No, we want things like `__getitem__` to work and to have more list-like behavior.

I use perfect matchings quite a lot, and I must say that having

```
sage: PerfectMatching([[3,1],[2,4]])
[(3, 1), (2, 4)]
```
is a pain.  I'm willing to live with it, but having list-like behaviour is actually counter productive, because you are not warned that the output is random.

I agree.  I would hope that it is possible to have the internal representation depend on this.

OK, if this doesn't pose huge problems, I'm all for it.  The current internal representation of set partition is a (sorted) `ClonableArray` of `Set`.

I think it would be best to have a sorted `ClonableArray` of sorted `Set`, so that openers are `[p[0] for p in P]` and closers are `[p[-1] for p in P]` whenever there is a total order available.

Unfortunately, `Set` was broken recently, see #23324.

As the traceback shows, you can implement a more refined `check` method. However, this will result in code duplication (well...essentially) and more of a maintenance burden.

Please be a little more explicit with the problem and avoid general (sensationalist) statements.
I do agree that there is a problem with the output of `(8, 2)`. However, there is some consistency:

```
sage: PerfectMatching([(1, 3), (2, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6)])
[(1, 3), (8, 2), (4, 7), (5, 6)]
```
This seems to be a problem with the current implementation of `__classcall_private__`. This should *not* handle normalizing input in this case; instead that is best left to `__init__` of `SetPartition` as all code paths must go through there.

> * There is some functionality in `PerfectMatching`, for example, `random_element` and `conjugate_by_permutation`which really belongs into `SetPartition`. 

Not necessarily. At least `random_element` seems specific to perfect matchings.

I don't think so as it is not worth the computation to find the "best" parent. Also, is it useful for it to be a `PerfectMatching`? If so, then it should just be

```python
def standardization(self):
    """
    Return the standardization of ``self``.

    See :meth:`SetPartition.standardization` for details.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: ...
    """
    return PerfectMatchings()(SetPartition.standardization(self))
```

Yes, I was not explicit enough.  I should have written: `SetPartition.__init__` calls        

```
ClonableArray.__init__(self, parent, sorted(map(Set, s), key=min), check=check)
```
and unfortunately

```
sage: Set([2,8])
{8, 2}
```
I do think that this is terrible, though :-)  What I don't understand is the following:

```
sage: repr(frozenset([2,8]))
'frozenset([8, 2])'
sage: str(frozenset([2,8]))
'frozenset([8, 2])'
sage: frozenset([2,8])
frozenset({2, 8})
```

Remark to myself: we cannot simply sort at output, because of

```
sage: Set([2,8])[0]
8
```

OK, I did some digging, and partially understand the issue now, it's a python thing.  It is quite confusing that `Set` supports indexing, I think that this should be turned off.  This is probably related to #12955.

In fact, turning off indexing in `Set`s, one could output them in sorted order :-)

I must admit that I do not completely understand the purpose of `Set`.

No, it would not. In fact, this is consistent what Python does with `set`, which *is* iterable.

It is a Sage version of `set` and supports non-hashable elements and is a parent.

I would just change it; it doesn't make sense to have a separate `_repr_`.

Huh? This does not agree with the actual change, which is simple and clearly the correct thing, and I don't see how that has anything to do with `PerfectMatching._repr_`.

Some things that I do not like are:

- A `check` in `__classcall_private__` as we should always check user input and it should not be used in code.

- `iter_aux` should be a separate standalone function.

- I do not like `try-except-else` blocks which could just be `try-except` blocks. The `else` adds extra (small) logical step that makes the flow a little harder. This might be more idiosyncratic, but it seems more complicated to me.

- This would be a good time to clean up a lot of the documentation formatting for, e.g., `is_noncrossing`. However, this is not a requirement for a positive review by me.

What do you mean by foreign code? Code that is in the wild? I don't see how it would break it (only their doctests/output, but in a trivial way).

No, I do not think you should change anything in `check`. I just do not understand what this had to do with `PerfectMatching._repr_` and what tolerance you are referring to.

A side issue, the lack of an error message previously was fine because of the traceback. However, it should be a `ValueError` and not an `AssertionError`.

No, I would just not have a `check` parameter in `__classcall_private__` (but it is good to have it in `__init__`). In case you are asking a slightly different question, in Sage code, instead of doing `PerfectMatching(foo)`, I feel we should do `PerfectMatchings()(foo, check=False)` (or whatever the appropriate parent is) as it has less indirection (i.e., is more explicit).

Because it is faster if someone needs to iterate and only have lists, it would be better documented, and works as a standalone.

I guess these do all come from the old perfect matching code. The:

```python
        try:
            next(it)
        except StopIteration:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
What makes this more complicated to me is that exceptions generally do special behavior and program flow should continue at the same level after things are processed. So the `else` block is (typically) vacuous as exceptions should typically not dictate program flow (Python makes this unavoidable at times). It is more stylistic, but I'm (overly) opinionated.

> > - This would be a good time to clean up a lot of the documentation formatting for, e.g., `is_noncrossing`. However, this is not a requirement for a positive review by me.

> 
> OK, but only after I understand what you want...

For example:

```
    def nestings_iterator(self):
        r"""
        INPUT:

            A perfect matching on a *totally ordered* ground set.

        OUTPUT:

            We place the elements of the ground set in order on a
            line and draw the set partition by linking consecutive
            elements of each block in the upper half-plane. This
            function returns an iterator over the pairs of nesting
            lines (as a line correspond to a pair, the iterator
            produces pairs of pairs).
```
is missing the one-line description, the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` blocks should not be intended, `INPUT` should not be there as `self` is not an input, etc.

it's not a big thing:  FindStat uses the repr of perfect matchings also for input, but this can be changed easily.  I guess in the long run it's better, the only drawback being that you cannot use the output as input anymore.

The code in check is `raise ValueError("%s is not an element of %s"%(self, self.parent()))`.  For some reason, at this point, `self` is already an instance of `PerfectMatching`, so the `_repr_` should be able to print it even if the number of parts is not always two.

I admit that this is a hack, but that's not my fault.
 
> A side issue, the lack of an error message previously was fine because of the traceback.

I disagree - for me, the tracebacks are a pain if there cause is at top level.

In `SetPartition`, we do have an `__init__`.  But `__classcall_private__` calls `SetPartitions.element_class`, passing the parameter `check`.  What should it pass if `check` is not available?  Or should it be `return P.element_class(P, *args, **kwds)`?

In `PerfectMatching`, currently there is no `__init__`, but I think it would make sense, because we have the special preprocessing for involutions.

I agree with this one, as you probably know :-)

For the free input box I'm guessing. Well, it is very close. I leave the final decision up to you. I don't strongly care either way.

> The code in check is `raise ValueError("%s is not an element of %s"%(self, self.parent()))`.  For some reason, at this point, `self` is already an instance of `PerfectMatching`, so the `_repr_` should be able to print it even if the number of parts is not always two.

Oh, I see.

> I admit that this is a hack, but that's not my fault.

Well, its only really an issue because of the custom `_repr_` and if that is making assumptions, but those are very easy to work around (if the code gets that far).

> > A side issue, the lack of an error message previously was fine because of the traceback.

>

The traceback is clear and it is the final part of it that gives the fault (just not the precise reason for it failing to be a set partition). This just becomes more code to maintain.

---

I've done a bit of cleanup of the perfect matchings and some of set partitions (much more is needed there) and taken care of duplicated code, the `__init__` issues, and improved the doc formatting.

I personally don't generally like `foo()` and `foo_iterator()` methods (well, both public), but that is another issue for another ticket.

If my changes look good, then positive review.

Could you please explain why the `check` parameter in `PerfectMatching.__classcall_private__` is wrong?

I added a `check` parameter to `AlternatingSignMatrix.__classcall_private__` in #23819, which makes me wonder what's correct.

I do not like it as user input should generally always be checked. Saying it is wrong is debatable, but I am not in favor of bypassing safety checks in a user-specific function.

Sorry to bother you again, Travis: `P.element_class(m, check=False)` does not work.  It seems one should do

```   
   m = my_matrix
   m.set_immutable()
   P = AlternatingSignMatrices(m.nrows())
   return P.element_class(P, m)
```
I am a bit worried about this pattern, however, because effectively one needs to know very exactly how the data is initialised - eg., here it is not sufficient to pass a matrix, one must make it immutable, too.

Having the parameter `check` seemed a bit like a middle ground - the internal representation remains hidden, only the checks are switched off.

I'd like to sort this out properly.

I admit that I had no idea which method is actually invoked when I call `element_class` - apparently it's `__init__`.  I find the number of initialisation methods very confusing.  Sticking with the `A = AlternatingSignMatrices(1)` example for concreteness:

* `AlternatingSignMatrix([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))` calls `__classcall_private__`, then `__init__`, then `__element_constructor__`, then `__init__` again.
* calling `AlternatingSignMatrix([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))` again, the first call to `__init__` is omitted...

Is there any documentation on this?

Single underscore `_element_constructor_`, but functionally yes (there is the indirection through `AlternatingSignMatrices.__call__` and the coercion framework).

Not true. This calls `AlternatingSignMatrix.__classcall_private__`, which really can call anything it wants to. In this case, it creates a parent, and then passes the data `[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)` off to that `AlternatingSignMatrices.__call__` -> `AlternatingSignMatrices._element_constructor_` -> `AlternatingSignMatrix.__init__`.

No, that is false (well, possibly depending on which `__init__` you are referring to). There was never a first call to `AlternatingSignMatrix.__init__`. There is a construction of the parent, but that may or may not be (re)created depending on if it has been cleared from the cache or not.

This is in the `__new__` and so many things in Sage have a similar traceback for bad (keyword) arguments. The error message at the end of the traceback tells you exactly what the problem is.

[1 0]
sage: ASM = AlternatingSignMatrices(M.nrows())
sage: _ = ASM(M)
init
[1 0]
[0 1]
init

```
The first one is from initializing `ASM.an_element()` for the coercion framework test:

```
sage: ASM.an_element()
[1 0]
[0 1]
```

I need an hour now...

In the end I decided against changing the `_repr_` of perfect matchings.  There is some benefit in being able to copy-pasting the output.

Travis, could you please set it to positive review.

Once I have enough energy, I'll open a metaticket for unifying `check` in sage :-)
