Having installed `gap_packages`, the following in a fresh Sage session fails:

```
sage: C = codes.HammingCode(GF(2), 5)
sage: C.covering_radius()  # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Gap produced error output
Error, Variable: 'GeneratorMatCode' must have a value
```

This is also evident running the doc-test with `--optional=sage,gap_packages`.
