The semantics of both Python types and Cython types have changed a lot since `is_extension_type()` was first written. In order to make it more clear why `is_extension_type()` is used, I suggest to replace it by more specific functions.

In this ticket, I implement a new function `can_assign_class(obj)` to determine whether `obj.__class__` can be assigned to.

This also changes `underlying_class` from a function to a method of `CategoryObject`.

I think we should hide `_underlying_class` from the public interface (well, specifically tab-completion).

Also, why the change in the test order?

Efficiency. Checking `can_assign_class` is very fast, so it's good to do that first.
