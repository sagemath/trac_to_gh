If I reinstall the package then the test does not fail. 
Good luck debugging this, but I am not doing it.

As a workaround one can add running this test once in spkg-install and ignore its result.

hmm, comparison of worksheet has been changed recently (to avoid using __cmp__)

This lives in sagenb/notebook/worksheet.py

I think at least that maybe there lacks `__ne__` and maybe also `@`total_ordering ?

This is not looking good. Unless I'm missing something, the fixes mentioned in [comment:11] are *not* in version 1.0 of SageNB. So the version number is misleading. Current SageNB master should be version 1.0.1 and then that tarball should be in Sage.

A git repository is not a source distribution. I suggest to use the `dist.sh` script to create the tarball.

That being said, it *might* be possible to install from a git repository, but then

1. it should be clearly documented in `SPKG.txt`.

2. the filename should be fixed (`1.0.1.tar.gz` is not acceptable because it doesn't contain `sagenb`).
