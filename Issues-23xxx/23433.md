I've also removed a special `weight_enumerator()` from GRS codes: this was **already** removed in #21576, and I have no idea how it got back! Git blame didn't tell me anything useful.

Lastly, I've added some tests which demonstrate that the special `weight_distribution()` for GRS codes and Golay codes actually correspond to that returned by the generic algorithm. These tests were sorely missing before.
