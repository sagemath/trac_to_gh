This patch removes a useless function. (Testing for distributivity can be done much faster.)

Hopefully someday I (or someone other) will do #17173.

It is clear that the function I suggest to remove is slowest.

First, it checks if a poset is a lattice by computing meet- and join-matrices; only other is needed, if the poset is bounded.

Second, this is the most trivial implementation. It is much faster to just check `|Ji(L)|=Mi(L)=h(L)` and `L` is graded.

Then it is easier just to make this faster.

But the devel manual says "It will display the message of your choice (and interact properly with the doctest framework)", i.e. if I just left the `EXAMPLES` block as it is, it will pass the doctest. Hence I don't know what to do.
