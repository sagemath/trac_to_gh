This patch removes a useless function. (Testing for distributivity can be done much faster.)

Hopefully someday I (or someone other) will do #17173.

It is clear that the function I suggest to remove is slowest.

First, it checks if a poset is a lattice by computing meet- and join-matrices; only other is needed, if the poset is bounded.

Second, this is the most trivial implementation. It is much faster to just check `|Ji(L)|=Mi(L)=h(L)` and `L` is graded.

Btw, a dismantlable and bounded poset is actually a dismantlable lattice. Do we want functions `is_*_lattice()` to `posets.py` in general? I do not know if there is, say, faster `is_relatively_complemented_lattice()` than just trying `LatticePoset(P).is_relatively_complemented()`.
