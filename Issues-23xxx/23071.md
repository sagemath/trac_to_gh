When you plot a graph with labels on edges, the label usually appear directly on the edges and it's not very good for readability.

The objective is to add an option to `Graph.plot()` to specify the background color of the label.

Example (see attach)

```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    sage: Word('001101').suffix_tree().plot()
```

You have to use

```
graphs.PetersenGraph().show(edge_labels=True, edge_labels_background="None")
```
because the parameter must be the string "None". I know this is not very intuitive, I'm looking for a way to make it clearer it the documentation if you have any idea.

Nope, `src/sage/plot/graphics.py` uses "transparent" so better to use the same terminology.
