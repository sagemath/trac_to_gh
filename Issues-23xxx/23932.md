```
sage: LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 'w', 1)
Univariate Laurent Polynomial Ring in w over Rational Field
sage: PolynomialRing(QQ, 'w', 1)
Multivariate Polynomial Ring in w over Rational Field
```
The difference actually comes from a wrong `__repr__` as

```
sage: type(LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 't')).__name__
'LaurentPolynomialRing_univariate_with_category'
sage: type(LaurentPolynomialRing(QQ, 't', 1)).__name__
'LaurentPolynomialRing_mpair_with_category'
```

While we are at it we clean the constructor. The attached branch calls directly `PolynomialRing` and then, depending whether the result is univariate or not, construct the relevant Laurent polynomial ring.

You should issue a warning saying this behavior has changed since, IIRC, the univariate polynomials have more functionality than multivariate.

I wonder what the `prepend_string` was originally used for...the comment about it is not so enlightening.

Yes, I agree. I should have checked the type before saying anything too.

Changes LGTM. This seems like a much needed cleanup.
