Trying to fix that, one meets a strange phenomenon in 

```
sage: from sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods import *
sage: list_of_subfunctions(Graph)[0]
```
namely, there is just one line that is 

```
<built-in function is_asteroidal_triple_free>
```
everybody else is an unbound method.

Several of these methods are defined in .pyx files: `pathwidth` in `vertex_separation.pyx`, `chromatic_polynomial` in `chrompoly.pyx`, etc. So there might be something else to explain the difference.

On my side, the patch passes tests, the html doc builds properly and it displays nicely in my browser. But I'm not using py3.

What else should we do to finalize the review ? Actually, this patch is still in `new` status, so I don't know if it should or not be reviewed...

Well, there are two problems:

* this does not fix the issue in python3

* I am not sure that the doc is exactly the same as before (no missing function ?)

* `strong_orientations_iterator` moved from `Orientations` to `Connectivity, orientations, trees`
* `cliques_maximum()` moved from `Clique-related methods` to `Unsorted`

Other methods are at the same place.
