On my side, the patch passes tests, the html doc builds properly and it displays nicely in my browser. But I'm not using py3.

What else should we do to finalize the review ? Actually, this patch is still in `new` status, so I don't know if it should or not be reviewed...

* `strong_orientations_iterator` moved from `Orientations` to `Connectivity, orientations, trees`
