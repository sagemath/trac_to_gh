sage: BooleanPolynomialRing?
Signature:      BooleanPolynomialRing(n=None, names=None, order='lex')
Docstring:     
   Construct a boolean polynomial ring with the following parameters:

   INPUT:

   * "n" -- number of variables (an integer > 1)

   * "names" -- names of ring variables, may be a string or
     list/tuple of strings

   * "order" -- term order (default: lex)
```

So we need `n > 1`.  And the error message for `n=0` agrees:

```
sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(0)
[...]
ValueError: Number of variables must be greater than 1.
```

However, the implementation allows `n=1`:

```
sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(1)
sage: B
Boolean PolynomialRing in None
```
and even negative `n`:

```
sage: B = BooleanPolynomialRing(-2)
sage: B
Boolean PolynomialRing in None
```

The `n=1` case appears to work fine, so I do not know why it is called out in the documentation. The 'n<0' cases must be a missing error check in the code.
