I've written a small tool that injects code *after* all `from __future__` imports:
https://github.com/timokau/python-inject

I've written that for a similar purpose (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/53816), but haven't done significant testing yet. Maybe its relevant for this usecase.

My trick is to have

```
from __future__ import division, absolute_import, print_function
```
as the first line of my init dot sage file:

- https://github.com/slel/sagemath-tips/blob/master/init-dot-sage/init.sage

Maybe SageMath 9.0 could start by such imports, whether Python2-based
or Python3-based, to encourage and guide everybody's transition to Python3,
and later on SageMath 10.0 could be Python3-only.

Should be using the `ast` module to parse out import statements.
