sage: (x>0)._sympy_()
...
NotImplementedError: relation
```

Reversely in SymPy:

```
In [9]: x >= 0
Out[9]: x ≥ 0

In [10]: _._sage_()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-10-7149a2430cab> in <module>()
----> 1 _._sage_()

AttributeError: 'GreaterThan' object has no attribute '_sage_'

In [11]: Eq(x, 3)
Out[11]: x = 3

In [12]: _._sage_()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-12-7149a2430cab> in <module>()
----> 1 _._sage_()

AttributeError: 'Equality' object has no attribute '_sage_'
```

This functionality is needed both by #22322 and #23923. Needed is a fix to `SympyConverter` in `expression-conversions.pyx`

The reverse patch in SymPy is added here, see the PR https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/13420

Indeed. No quarell here.

> Are Mma objects not Sage objects? 


They are by definition Sage objects, but have no meaning for interacting with Sage "native" objects ; a conversion is needed for that.

>Should we enforce coding conventions between projects?


I think that's almost what I was thinking about (syntax consistency rather than coding conventions).

Note that the non-Sympy interfaces are not **that** consistent : compare, for example, interfaces to mathematica, giac, R, maple and fricas... Unifying them would represent a lot of work second-intention consistency is hard...

Another reason was that, unless I'm mistaken, the docs I read when I was starting to learn Sage (about 2-3 years ago) recommended to "end users" to use only "exposed" methods, leaving the unexposed ones to internal Sage use. I certainly had this recommendation in mind when I asked my question.

Has this recommendation changed ?

> Please don't forget to set back positive.


Of course ;-).

And, BTW, this was only a //question//, not a criticism...
