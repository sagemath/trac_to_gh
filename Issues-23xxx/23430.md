```
For example

```
sage: RBF(1, 1/2)
```

will fail with `unable to convert 1 to a RealBall` but

```
sage: RBF(1, 0.5)
```

will succeed.   If this is not intentional I'll put a patch together.

It looks like the line `cdef Integer foo` should be removed.

This test:

```python
sage: RBF(13, 1)
[1e+1 +/- 4.01]
```

looks crazy to me. Namely, why is the radius 1 printed as 4.01? I get the same output in the current version of Sage if I put in `RBF(13, 1.)`, so this behavior has been around for a while. Is it actually correct / expected? What am I missing?

`@`gh-bryangingechen My guess is that it is an error with the printing (maybe with upstream):

```
sage: RBF(13,0.89)
[1.3e+1 +/- 0.891]
sage: RBF(11,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 1.91]
sage: RBF(12,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 2.91]
sage: RBF(13,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 3.91]
sage: RBF(14,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 4.91]
sage: RBF(15,0.9)
[2e+1 +/- 5.91]
```

```
sage: x = RBF(14,0.9)
sage: x.center()
14.0000000000000
sage: x.rad()
0.90000000
sage: x.rad().parent()
Real Field with 30 bits of precision
sage: (0.9).parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: x.center().parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
Should there be a precision loss with the radius too?

David, don't forget to add your real name to the authors field.

I think this also might fix #25456.

Sorry about the extra foo.

The printing is a consequence of Arb's printing.
