```
For example

```
sage: RBF(1, 1/2)
```

will fail with `unable to convert 1 to a RealBall` but

```
sage: RBF(1, 0.5)
```

will succeed.   If this is not intentional I'll put a patch together.

It looks like the line `cdef Integer foo` should be removed.

This test:

```python
sage: RBF(13, 1)
[1e+1 +/- 4.01]
```

looks crazy to me. Namely, why is the radius 1 printed as 4.01? I get the same output in the current version of Sage if I put in `RBF(13, 1.)`, so this behavior has been around for a while. Is it actually correct / expected? What am I missing?

@bryangingechen My guess is that it is an error with the printing (maybe with upstream):

```
sage: RBF(13,0.89)
[1.3e+1 +/- 0.891]
sage: RBF(11,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 1.91]
sage: RBF(12,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 2.91]
sage: RBF(13,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 3.91]
sage: RBF(14,0.9)
[1e+1 +/- 4.91]
sage: RBF(15,0.9)
[2e+1 +/- 5.91]
```

```
sage: x = RBF(14,0.9)
sage: x.center()
14.0000000000000
sage: x.rad()
0.90000000
sage: x.rad().parent()
Real Field with 30 bits of precision
sage: (0.9).parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: x.center().parent()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
```
Should there be a precision loss with the radius too?

David, don't forget to add your real name to the authors field.

I think this also might fix #25456.

Sorry about the extra foo.

The printing is a consequence of Arb's printing.  The arb function `arb_get_str` returns a string that is guaranteed to contain the original ball when read back in and is rounded so that it is accurate to one unit in the last decimal place.  This behavior can be puzzling particularly when the error magnitude is not much smaller than the absolute value of of the midpoint.
