The test

```
            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.fractional_chromatic_index(solver='GLPK')
            3.0
```
added in `src/sage/graphs/graph.py` by #23658 fails with GLPK-4.63 on 32-bit.

As a workaround, we use PPL by default in #24099.

I suspect that we need to change `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1:` to `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1 + tol:`, where `tol = 0 if solver=='PPL' else 1e-6`. I don't like this solution, but I don't know what else we can do. 

I don't have access to a 32-bit machine and so cannot test.

I still see the bug (on a 32-bit debian virtual machine). The default solver seems instantaneous, but I let `solver='GLPK'` run for about 15 minutes and did not get an answer.

This is unfortunate.

The only solutions I see are:
- Force to use `PPL`, but this is not nice for users with a 64 bits machine (most of the users I guess)
- Raise an error when the solver is `glpk` on a 32 bits machine
and none of them are satisfactory.

If I force PPL on the inner (matching) LP:

Following above discussion, I added a tolerance gap for numerical LP solvers. 

Note that we can use the `networkx` implementation of the blossom algorithm via the `matching` method, but it does not solve the issue. Actually, it's slower and worse for the rounding as I observe the issue on a 64 bits machine...

The oracle implementation here is naive, and bound to get very slow; it's integer LP without Edmonds' constraints,
instead of a "normal" LP over the matching polytope with Edmonds' constraints (aka blossom inequalities).
So this would need yet another oracle (as there are too exponentially many inequalities there), but well, it's polynomial time then.
The generated constraints can stay, so this should be fast.
