The test

```
            sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
            sage: g.fractional_chromatic_index(solver='GLPK')
            3.0
```
added in `src/sage/graphs/graph.py` by #23658 fails with GLPK-4.63 on 32-bit.

As a workaround, we use PPL by default in #24099.

I suspect that we need to change `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1:` to `if M.solve(log = verbose) <= 1 + tol:`, where `tol = 0 if solver=='PPL' else 1e-6`. I don't like this solution, but I don't know what else we can do. 

I don't have access to a 32-bit machine and so cannot test.

This is unfortunate.

The only solutions I see are:
- Force to use `PPL`, but this is not nice for users with a 64 bits machine (most of the users I guess)
- Raise an error when the solver is `glpk` on a 32 bits machine
and none of them are satisfactory.

Following above discussion, I added a tolerance gap for numerical LP solvers. 

Note that we can use the `networkx` implementation of the blossom algorithm via the `matching` method, but it does not solve the issue. Actually, it's slower and worse for the rounding as I observe the issue on a 64 bits machine...

```
         matching = [fe for fe in frozen_edges if M.get_values(b[fe]) == 1]
```
This line also needs changing because the test "== 1" is not robust.

The oracle implementation here is naive, and bound to get very slow; it's integer LP without Edmonds' constraints,
instead of a "normal" LP over the matching polytope with Edmonds' constraints (aka blossom inequalities).
So this would need yet another oracle (as there are too exponentially many inequalities there), but well, it's polynomial time then.
The generated constraints can stay, so this should be fast.

I took a quick look at the function now. I would suggest the following changes:

1. Before adding a new constraint to the master problem, verify that `matching` is indeed a matching. In this way, the master problem will always be a correct relaxation, even if an inexact oracle is used.

2. When the numerical solver that is used for solving the separation problem does not find a matching of value greater than 1 + epsilon, you can switch to PPL - then, with a bit of luck, it can prove the bound <= 1.

3. It will make sense to have separate parameters for the solver used for the master problem and the one(s) used for the separation problem.
