```
and the same for QQ of course.

This fixes a bug with `Hom` where the meet computed is a join category, in which case `X` is not a subclass of `category.parent_class`. This causes problems with the number fields meeting with matrix spaces.

Follow up at #24432.

Failures are related to this:

```
sage: x = QQ['x'].0
sage: t = abs(ZZ.random_element(10^6))
sage: K = NumberField(x^2 + 2*3*7*11, "a"+str(t))
sage: a = K.gen()

sage: Hom(K, a.matrix().parent())
Set of Morphisms from Number Field in a791947 with defining polynomial x^2 + 462 to Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field in Category of infinite rings
<class 'sage.categories.homset.Homset_with_category'>
```
compared to vanilla Sage:

```
sage: Hom(K, a.matrix().parent())
Set of Homomorphisms from Number Field in a395598 with defining polynomial x^2 + 462 to Full MatrixSpace of 2 by 2 dense matrices over Rational Field
sage: type(Hom(K, a.matrix().parent()))
<class 'sage.rings.homset.RingHomset_generic_with_category'>
```

This differences comes from the fact that the category becomes a join category (in the branch) because that is the meet category computed by `Hom`:

```
sage: K.category()._meet_(a.matrix().parent().category())
Category of infinite rings
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.categories.category.JoinCategory_with_category'>
```
versus vanilla:

```
sage: K.category()._meet_(a.matrix().parent().category())
Category of rings
sage: type(_)
<class 'sage.categories.rings.Rings_with_category'>
```
Now, `K` is not a subclass of the meet category's `parent_class`, which causes the `Cat.parent_class._Hom_` method to now raise an error:

```
sage: Cat = K.category()._meet_(a.matrix().parent().category())
sage: Cat.parent_class
<class 'sage.categories.category.JoinCategory.parent_class'>
sage: Cat.parent_class._Hom_(K, a.matrix().parent(), Cat)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 Cat.parent_class._Hom_(K, a.matrix().parent(), Cat)
TypeError: unbound method _Hom_() must be called with JoinCategory.parent_class instance as first argument (got NumberField_quadratic_with_category instance instead)
```
versus vanilla

```
sage: Cat = K.category()._meet_(a.matrix().parent().category())
sage: Cat.parent_class
<class 'sage.categories.rings.Rings.parent_class'>
sage: Cat.parent_class._Hom_(K, a.matrix().parent(), Cat)

Strictly speaking it does not, since the `category` argument is passed in the call

```
H = X.category().parent_class._Hom_(X, Y, category = category)
```

> and there might be a situation where this works with `category` being passed in (say, `Modules()` instead of `Algebras()`).

Do you have any example of this? I might understand the objection, but my "cheap fix" is indeed fixing problems and not creating new ones (as far as doctesting is complete).

As you might have noticed, the call line 405 in `categories/homset.py` is already hackish. Parents implementing their own `_Hom_` method should by themselves call a super (or equivalent).

If you agree with the above, there are two concrete ways of doing this:

I might understand the objection, but my \"cheap fix\" is indeed fixing problems and not creating new ones (as far as doctesting is complete).\n\nNo, your hack is creating new problems. For example, suppose `X` is an algebra with:\n\n- basis `{a, b}`,\n- multiplication `a^2 = b^2 = ab = a`.\n\nIf we want to construct a map `f: X -> X` given by `a,b |-> b`. This is not an algebra morphism, but instead only a module morphism. If we have `Algebras._Hom_`, which expects the category to be algebras (as it should), then this will break horribly and there is no way to use a `Modules._Hom_` (assuming it is also implemented).\n\nFor an example where this is currently implemented, we can replace `Algebras` with `HighestWeightCrystals` and `Modules` with `Crystals`. I have also constructed similar morphisms as above for my research.\n\n> > So this change is a regression in my mind because the Homset classes do not have the inheritance of the categories.

Parents implementing their own `_Hom_` method should by themselves call a super (or equivalent).\n\nI am not sure this would be the same behavior. There are two different things going on:\n\n1. If a parent does not implement a `_Hom_` method, then it should fall back to the specified category. Continuing my above example, this would only default to `Algebras._Hom_`, which would be wrong.\n2. The other behavior is if the homset returned by `X._Hom_` does not support the more general category, say, because it takes advantage of the extra structure (say, is only uses the algebra generating set and not the [possibly infinite] basis).

No, `_Hom_` ignores the category input.

No, your hack is creating new problems. For example, suppose `X` is an algebra with:

- basis `{a, b}`,
- multiplication `a^2 = b^2 = ab = a`.

If we want to construct a map `f: X -> X` given by `a,b |-> b`. This is not an algebra morphism, but instead only a module morphism. If we have `Algebras._Hom_`, which expects the category to be algebras (as it should), then this will break horribly and there is no way to use a `Modules._Hom_` (assuming it is also implemented).

For an example where this is currently implemented, we can replace `Algebras` with `HighestWeightCrystals` and `Modules` with `Crystals`. I have also constructed similar morphisms as above for my research.

> 
> As you might have noticed, the call line 405 in `categories/homset.py` is already hackish. Parents implementing their own `_Hom_` method should by themselves call a super (or equivalent).

I am not sure this would be the same behavior. There are two different things going on:

1. If a parent does not implement a `_Hom_` method, then it should fall back to the specified category. Continuing my above example, this would only default to `Algebras._Hom_`, which would be wrong.
2. The other behavior is if the homset returned by `X._Hom_` does not support the more general category, say, because it takes advantage of the extra structure (say, is only uses the algebra generating set and not the [possibly infinite] basis). One should expect that `X.category()._Hom_` would also take advantage of that extra structure as well and would similarly forbid more general categories.

> Before doing my "cheap fix", I thought that the good solution would be to remove this line 405 and fix the parents. Do you agree that this would be **the** solution?

It doesn't make sense to me for the parent/category implementation of `_Hom_` to do super calls when something fails. I think it would create a lot of redundant logic (the error handling). Also, everything in between `X.category()` and the specified `category` would likely (needlessly) fail, making these calls significantly slower when there is a large category difference. While this is a solution, I think it is a very bad solution.

I think special handling the join categories is going to be the proper fix as join categories are somewhat special in the category framework. While it may be just fixing the symptoms, it does not have the drawbacks that the other approaches have. I will push something today.

This would better be doctested! Could you come up with concrete examples to be added to the branch? Especially because we are going to play with the `_Hom_` code.

Actually, from looking at it and thinking about it more, the category of highest weight crystals is a full subcategory, so it does not quite work (in contrast to algebras and modules). So instead I just manufactured a minimal example that fails with your change.

Here is a branch that does special handling of `JoinCategory`. It passes all the tests that were previously failing.
