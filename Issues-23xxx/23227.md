Cython will soon raise an error in these cases.  I think the best thing to do is to wait until we update to a new version of Cython and change these pxd files then.  I think it's worth leaving this ticket open until that point in case someone else runs into a similar problem.

I convinced Cython upstream to downgrade this to a warning for now. That will make our life easier, since we can first upgrade to Cython 0.26 (in beta now) and then fix this gradually.
