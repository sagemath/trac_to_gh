An issue found by Victor Spitzer: Sage fails to simplify

```
sage: f = log(sqrt(2) - 1) + log(sqrt(2) + 1)
sage: f.simplify_full()
log(sqrt(2) + 1) + log(sqrt(2) - 1)
```
without help. Doing

```
sage: f.simplify_real().simplify_log()
0
```
works, but it would be nice if `simplify_{log,full})` detected by themselves that `simplify_real()` is applicable in this case.
