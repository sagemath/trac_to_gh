`InteractiveLPProblemStandardForm::run_simplex_method()` does not show the typeset dictionaries.

In terminal,

```
sage: A = ([1,0],[0,1],[5,5],[6/10, 15/10])
sage: b = (50,35,300,63)
sage: c = (200,350)
sage: P = InteractiveLPProblem(A, b, c, variable_type=">=").standard_form()
sage: view(P.run_simplex_method())
```
The last `view(...)` outputs Latex code directly, instead of typeset dictionaries. See attachment view_run_simplex_method.pdf.

In Juypter, `P.run_simplex_method()` displays a mixture of LaTex code and the typeset dictionary.

As for the terminal, I am not sure what the desired output should be. The attached branch will work OK if one does `view(P.run_simplex_method(), tightpage=False)`, but produces no output at all otherwise. Compare it with results for `view([1,2])` with tight page and not.

The question is in how HTML should be rendered if sent to LaTeX. `P.run_simplex_method()` actually produces valid LaTeX code that can be just dropped normally between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`, but `view` makes use of some extra packages that make it not working.
