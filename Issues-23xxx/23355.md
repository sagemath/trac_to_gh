Keywords: polyhedron

When using the orthogonal/orthonormal feature of the affine hull function of a polyhedron (introduced in #22804), there is a problem with the one point polyhedron:


```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[7]])
sage: P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.affine_hull()
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 verte
sage: P.affine_hull(orthogonal='True')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 dense matrices over Integer Ring' and 'Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring'
sage: P.affine_hull(orthonormal='True')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
...
TypeError: unsupported operand parent(s) for *: 'Full MatrixSpace of 0 by 0 dense matrices over Integer Ring' and 'Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring'
```

This is how it should be:

```
sage: P = Polyhedron([[7]]); P
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^1 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.affine_hull()
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.affine_hull(orthonormal='True')
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
sage: P.affine_hull(orthogonal='True')
A 0-dimensional polyhedron in QQ^0 defined as the convex hull of 1 vertex
```

The reason why this didn't work properly is the fact that if a Matrix is generated from a list it cannot correctly guess its dimensions if the list is empty. The whole fix is simply to exchange the line

```
M = matrix(self.base_ring(), [list(w) for w in itertools.islice(v.neighbors(), self.dim())])
``` 
by

```
M = matrix(self.base_ring(), self.dim(), self.ambient_dim(), [list(w) for w in itertools.islice(v.neighbors(), self.dim())])
``` 
giving the dimensions explicitly. I also added a doctest (under the section TESTS) documenting that the bug is fixed.

Hi Moritz,

Could you add a reference to this ticket just before the tests you added?

Apart from that it looks good to me! You can set it to positive review on my behalf once this is done!
