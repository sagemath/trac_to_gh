Moving the default implementation `Parent.construction` (which just
returns None) to `Sets.ParentMethods` enables categories to provide an
implementation when relevant.

This ticket also fixes QuaternionAlgebra, QuaternionOrder,
LazyPowerSeriesRing and MPCComplexField whose categories were not
properly initialized (and as a consequence they did not inherit
anymore the construction method)
