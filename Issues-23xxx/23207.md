This ticket implements the exterior power /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M*) for a free module of finite rank *M* (*p* being a positive integer), i.e. the set of alternating contravariant tensors of type (*p*,0) on *M*. Previously only the exterior power of the *dual* of *M*, i.e. /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M**), was implemented, as the parent of alternating forms of degree *p*. More specifically, the ticket introduces two new classes:

- the parent class `ExtPowerFreeModule` for /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M*)
- the element class `AlternatingContrTensor` for elements of /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M*)

Note that the pre-existing class for  /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M**), which was called `ExtPowerFreeModule`, has been renamed `ExtPowerDualFreeModule`, since it regards the exterior power of the dual of *M*. 

The class for the elements of *M*, `FiniteRankFreeModuleElement` , inherits from the new class `AlternatingContrTensor`, reflecting the fact that /\<sup>1</sup>(*M*) = *M*. In particular, this allows one to consider module elements in operations like the exterior product or the interior product. For instance, for *a* and *b* in *M*,  `a.wedge(b)` returns now the element *a*/\*b* of /\<sup>2</sup>(*M*).

In addition, the ticket implements the interior products

- /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M*) x /\<sup>*q*</sup>(*M**)  --> /\<sup>*q-p*</sup>(*M**)
- /\<sup>*p*</sup>(*M**) x /\<sup>*q*</sup>(*M*)  --> /\<sup>*q-p*</sup>(*M*)

for *p*<=*q* via the method `interior_product` in classes `AlternatingContrTensor` and `FreeModuleAltForm`.

Besides, some slight updates in all source files in `src/sage/tensor/modules` have been performed:

- for the migration to Python3, a few `range(...)` have been changed to `list(range(...))` in places where a list is expected instead of an iterator
- bibliographic references have been reformated to provide links to the master bibliography file `src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst`.

This cannot be because the argument `antisym` is not intended to be an iterator, but a list of integers or tuples encoding the antisymmetries of the tensor; for instance `antisym=[(0,1), (2,3)]` means that the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of its first (0) and second (1) argument/index, as well as with respect to the permutation of its third (2) and fourth (3) argument/index. In this context, `antisym=[0,1,2,3]` is a short-hand for `antisym=[(0,1,2,3)]`. For alternating tensors of degree `p`, one therefore should have `antisym=[(0,...,p-1)]`, short-handed as `antisym=[0,...,p-1]` and generated by `antisym=list(range(p))`.

`range` in Python3 has its own type (currently `xrange` in Python2) that you can explicitly check against:

```
sage: from six.moves import range as py3range
sage: x = py3range(5)
sage: isinstance(x, py3range)
True
```
So you can still support the Python3 range but not support iterators.

Yes, but I am afraid I don't understand what you have in mind. The attribute `_antisym` of tensors is a list, which in practice is very short: in most applications, it contains 0 or 1 element, sometimes 2 (e.g. [(0,1), (2,3)] for the fully covariant version of the Riemann tensor). The elements are tuples indicating which indices are involved in the antisymmetry.

This unique antisymmetry is encoded by the tuple `(0,1,...,p-1)`, `p` being the degree of the alternating tensor. So we must have `_antisym=[(0,1,...,p-1)]` in this case, with `(0,1,...,p-1)` being really a tuple of integers. What would be the advantage of using Python3 `range` in this context?

<a id='comment:11'></a>Are you going to support input of `range`? I think this would be good and means you don't have to wrap so many of those calls with `list`. I know it is a shorthand, but it still seems very nice to have. Also, I think it would be really good to support

```
resu.set_comp()[:] = range(1, self._rank+1)
```

Both `_init_derived` and `_del_derived` are unnecessary since they are just super calls.

The changes to `tensor_with_indices.py` are unnecessary as in Python3:

```python
>>> def foo(a1,a2):
...     print(a1, a2)
... 
>>> foo(*range(2))
0 1
```

```diff
type-(1,0)
type-`(1,0)`
```

Remove the commented code:

```
# From sage/modules/module.pyx:
#-----------------------------
### The Element should also implement _rmul_ (or _lmul_)
#
# class MyElement(sage.structure.element.ModuleElement):
#     def _rmul_(self, c):
#         ...
```

Break the long line here:

```diff
     The class :class:`FiniteRankFreeModuleElement` inherits from
-    :class:`~sage.tensor.modules.alternating_contr_tensor.AlternatingContrTensor` because the elements of a free module `M` of
+    :class:`~sage.tensor.modules.alternating_contr_tensor.AlternatingContrTensor`
+    because the elements of a free module `M` of
     finite rank over a commutative ring `R` are identified with tensors of
     type `(1,0)` on `M` via the canonical map
```

I think this looks better (I believe there are two instances of this):

```diff
*p-th exterior power of*
`p`-*th exterior power of*
```

Are you concerned about dealing with old pickles? If so, have you checked that you can correctly unpickle a previous object? In particular, I think because you renamed the class, the old pickles will not create the correct class, but instead the dual version you constructed here. Although it might just be much more feasible (on our side) to deal with the backwards incompatibility instead.

Done! We have now:

```
sage: from six.moves import range
sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3, name='M')
sage: e = M.basis('e')
sage: a = M.tensor((2,1), sym=range(2))

sage: b = M.tensor((0,3), antisym=range(3))
sage: b.symmetries()
no symmetry; antisymmetry: (0, 1, 2)
sage: c = M.tensor((0,3), antisym=range(1,3))
sage: c.symmetries()
no symmetry; antisymmetry: (1, 2)
sage: t = M.tensor((2,0))
sage: t[:] = [[2,1,-3],[0,-4,5],[-1,4,2]]
sage: s = t.symmetrize(*range(2))
sage: s.symmetries()
symmetry: (0, 1); no antisymmetry
sage: s == t.symmetrize(0,1)
True
sage: s = t.antisymmetrize(*range(2))
sage: s.symmetries()
no symmetry; antisymmetry: (0, 1)

True
```

Done as well; with the same settings as above, we have:

```
sage: v = M(range(3))
sage: v.display()
e_1 + 2 e_2
sage: v.set_comp()[:] = range(1, 4)
sage: v.display()
e_0 + 2 e_1 + 3 e_2
```

Not at all. I don't think anybody is unpickling old exterior powers of dual free modules. So we can safely ignore this. But thanks for pointing it. One shall indeed have this in mind when changing the name of a class.
