This ticket starts by splitting the `spkg-install` for python2 and python3 into separate `spkg-build` and `spkg-install` scripts as recommended by #21726 (we said we would apply this change to individual packages on a case-by-case basis, and I figured as long as I was making changes to these scripts it would be good to do).

This also fixes a general bug with the build, where building a new Python can link the python executable and extension modules with an old libpython left in `$SAGE_LOCAL`, leading to possible errors.

Rather than deleting the old libpython first, I think it's cleaner to pass the correct `$LDFLAGS` to prevent this from happening.

Finally, this moves the tests that certain extension modules built to after building, but before installing, and runs the tests out of the source directory.  This is a change extracted from #22509.

Given that these scripts are mostly the same for Python 2 and Python 3, would it be possible to have just one script (say, by symlinking) and then use `$PKG_NAME` inside the script where needed?

Looking at the difference between the Python 2 and Python 3 scripts, I wonder why this only occurs for Python 2:

```
  # Use EXTRA_CFLAGS for user-defined CFLAGS since Python puts its own
  # default flags like -O3 after CFLAGS but before EXTRA_CFLAGS.
  # We also disable warnings about unused variables/functions which are
  # common in Cython-generated code.
  export EXTRA_CFLAGS="`testcflags.sh -Wno-unused` $CFLAGS"
  unset CFLAGS
```
I think this is just an omission and it should be there for Python 3 also.

Apparently you added that in #19899, but didn't add it to python3, presumably just due to lack of python3 testing at the time.  Probably it applies there too.

Well, the old install script worked like:

A. Build Python

B. Check that `_scproxy.so` was compiled (Python does not consider it an error if this optional module was not compiled)

C. Install Python

D. Check that `_scproxy` can be imported.

Earlier versions of the install script did not have step B. This means that a broken Python could be installed in step C. So step B was added as a way of doing step D before installing. But now that you have arranged things like


A. Build Python

B. Check that `_scproxy.so` was compiled (Python does not consider it an error if this optional module was not compiled)

D. Check that `_scproxy` can be imported.

C. Install Python

there is no longer any reason for B: if `_scproxy` can be imported, surely it was compiled.

Those gcc flags are already something of a mess.  Several of the flags are duplicated (I'm not sure why). But also, as I explained in the commit message, our `LDFLAGS` are inserted very early on, so the linker finds `-lpython2.7` in `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib`, when it should be finding it in the current directory--the libpython that was just built.

I don't agree with the `-L.` thing. I suggest to take it out and create a separate ticket of it (if you think that it is important enough).

The problem with the current approach is that those `LDFLAGS` are inherited by other Python packages. I don't know the exact mechanism, since it doesn't happen with the Sage library for example. But this is an example command line from scipy with this patch:

```
gcc -pthread -shared -L. -L/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib -shared -L/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scipy/cluster/_vq.o -L/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib -L/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib -Lbuild/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7 -lopenblas -lopenblas -lpython2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/scipy/cluster/_vq.so
```
Without this patch, this `-L.` wasn't there.

Okay, there is a better solution, which in retrospect is obvious--instead of exporting `LDFLAGS="-L. ..."`, just pass the additional flags at `make` time:

    `make LDFLAGS="-L. $LDFLAGS"`

This does not change the defaults that are saved to the `Makefile` by `configure` (and hence does not impact the flags used in the future for building extension modules).  But it does ensure that the correct flags are added for building the extension modules included with Python.

Whether or not this is an upstream bug is debatable, but I'll ask on python-dev.
