Currently, factorization is broken over fraction fields over non-prime finite fields:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^3 + a
sage: f.factor()
x^3 + a
sage: (x - a + 1)^3
x^3 + a
```

This is probably related to #17697.

As a workaround one can factor over the function field:

```
sage: K.<t> = FunctionField(k)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: f = x^3 + a
sage: f.factor()
(x + 2*a + 1)^3
```

Doing this seems not to come with a performance penalty:

```
sage: k = GF(3)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: small = prod([K.random_element(degree=2) for n in range(3)])
sage: medium = prod([K.random_element(degree=8) for n in range(10)])
sage: large = prod([K.random_element(degree=16) for n in range(1000)])
sage: %timeit small.factor()
1000 loops, best of 3: 389 µs per loop # before
1000 loops, best of 3: 390 µs per loop # after (the same polynomial pickled and unpickled)
sage: %timeit medium.factor()
100 loops, best of 3: 2.45 ms per loop # before
100 loops, best of 3: 2.55 ms per loop # after
sage: %timeit large.factor()
1 loop, best of 3: 2.62 s per loop # before
1 loop, best of 3: 2.62 s per loop # after
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>The problem really seems to boil down to the problem described in #17697:

```
sage: k.<a> = GF(9)
sage: K = k['t'].fraction_field()
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3(t)
// number of vars : 2
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    a x
//        block   2 : ordering C
// quotient ring from ideal
_[1]=a2-a-1
```

Singular's `factorize()` is ignoring the quotient ring. However, if we omit the fraction field, then our code does not use the quotient ring construction and factorization works:

```
sage: R.<x> = k[]
sage: R._singular_()
polynomial ring, over a field, global ordering
// coefficients: ZZ/3[a]/(a^2-a-1)
// number of vars : 1
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x
//        block   2 : ordering C
```

It seems that we have to fall back to our own function field factorization code here.
