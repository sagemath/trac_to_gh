```
sage: FreeModule(ZZ,1)==FreeModule(ZZ,1,inner_product_matrix=matrix.identity(1)*2)
True
```
Since these two objects are mathematically rather different,
this should return False.

I'm afraid these doctest failures from patchbot appear to be reproducible:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/pushout.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long src/sage/categories/homset.py  # 3 doctests failed
```
Is it just that these were based on wrong behavior and should be changed?
