The one line description of `text` refers to arguments `(x,y)` that do not appear in the signature

```
Signature:      text(*args, **kwds)
Docstring:     
   Returns a 2D text graphics object at the point (x,y).

   Type "text.options" for a dictionary of options for 2D text.
...
```
Idem for `point2d` (that even refers to `size`)

```
Signature:      point2d(*args, **kwds)
Docstring:     
   A point of size "size" defined by point = (x,y).
...
```
Or for `polygon2d`

```
Signature:      polygon2d(*args, **kwds)
Docstring:     
   Returns a 2-dimensional polygon defined by "points".
```

The first examples of `line2d` are completely useless

```
Signature:      line2d(*args, **kwds)
Docstring:     
   Create the line through the given list of points.
...
EXAMPLES:

   A line with no points or one point:

      sage: line([])      #returns an empty plot
      Graphics object consisting of 0 graphics primitives
      sage: import numpy; line(numpy.array([]))
      Graphics object consisting of 0 graphics primitives
      sage: line([(1,1)])
      Graphics object consisting of 1 graphics primitive
```
