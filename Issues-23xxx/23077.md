```
The goal is to always return some float, either real or complex but:

```
sage: from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import py_float_for_doctests as py_float
sage: py_float(I, {'parent':RealField(10)})
...
TypeError: unable to convert '1.0*I' to a real number
```
The code shows it's only done if there is no parent given:

```
    if kwds is not NULL:
        return (<object>kwds)['parent'](n)
    else:
        try:
            return RR(n)
        except TypeError:
            return CC(n)
```
The ticket should make it possible to fall back on the associated complex field of any parent.
