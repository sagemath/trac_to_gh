Carlo Verschoor reports that this is broken in Sage 8.0

```
cones = [Cone([(0,1),(1,0)]),Cone([(-2,-1),(-1,-3)]),Cone([(0,1),(-2,-1)]),Cone([(-1,-3),(1,0)])]
F = Fan(cones)
F.plot()
```
due to `float(arctan2(RDF(-3),RDF(-1)))` having an imaginary component

The problem is that we are chasing parents in https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/libs/pynac/pynac.pyx#L1829

A naive fix would be

While we are at it, this is also wrongish:

```
    if P is ZZ:
        P = RR
```
for

```
from sage.libs.pynac.pynac import py_atan2_for_doctests as py_atan2
py_atan2(-1/2, 0)
```
gives `TypeError: unable to convert pi to a rational` Not sure what is correct fix here - maybe if `P` is real, we need to check that it is possible to convert something like `RDF` or `RR` into `P` as well and if not - replace `P` with "generic reals" whatever that is?

Using the check that `P` coerces into `RR` seems to work.
