$ readelf -d local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_ssl.so

```
The difference is of course that the executable’s RUNPATH is not used for finding indirect library dependencies: http://blog.qt.io/blog/2011/10/28/rpath-and-runpath/

In an ideal world we'd either 
* ship all our dependencies (including openssl) without holes in the dependency chain, or 
* let you link against the same libs as openssl (and not build our own libz).

The best course of action is probably to add `-Wl,--disable-new-dtags` to our LDFLAGS when compiling Sage, that would ensure that our zlib wins.

Which looks very much the same as before. Would you happen to have upgraded the system zlib on your box? 1.2.11 is the only version available in Gentoo now and you wouldn't get the message if the version on the system is the same as in sage.

It does work. And you'll get correct results on the first install.

Well they are technically interchangeable, they expose the same API, they just have different internals during tuning to find the best internals. You are right, using static libraries would solve the problem, but you would probably have to rethink the way it is built and tuned.
Like I said you, will have the correct result on first install, on subsequent installs or upgrade you will have to remove the old installed library to get the correct tuning.

I won't oppose the change if you, Jeroen and Erik think it is the way to go. But I think having the conversation and understanding some of the implications was necessary.
