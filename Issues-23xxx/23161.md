The dependency on libz is not direct, but via libpython and libssl. The difference between our systems seems to be that I'm using RPATH any you use RUNPATH.

```
$ readelf -d local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_ssl.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x13d60 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libssl.so.10]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libcrypto.so.10]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpython2.7.so.1.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpthread.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x000000000000000f (RPATH)              Library rpath: [/home/vbraun/Code/sage.git/local/lib]
[...]
```
The difference is of course that the executable’s RUNPATH is not used for finding indirect library dependencies: http://blog.qt.io/blog/2011/10/28/rpath-and-runpath/

In an ideal world we'd either 
* ship all our dependencies (including openssl) without holes in the dependency chain, or 
* let you link against the same libs as openssl (and not build our own libz).

The best course of action is probably to add `-Wl,--disable-new-dtags` to our LDFLAGS when compiling Sage, that would ensure that our zlib wins.

Hmm, for some reason I cannot reproduce the problem anymore. There must be some non-deterministic aspect...

Which looks very much the same as before. Would you happen to have upgraded the system zlib on your box? 1.2.11 is the only version available in Gentoo now and you wouldn't get the message if the version on the system is the same as in sage.

It depends on which transitive dependency is pulled first, so it may very well be random.

    "body": "<a id='comment:15'></a>\nAfter looking up some more stuff as part of discussion we are also having regarding gf2x upcoming release, stuff on freeBSD and other libtool matters. I now think disabling `disable-new-dtags` may actually bring more harm than good.\n\nWithout it `DT_RUNPATH` is not present in the elf file. Just `DT_RPATH`, which means that `DT_RPATH` has priority look up over `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. That doesn't seem to be a problem until you realise how libtool wraps binaries to be able run the `make check` target with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or equivalent) to make sure you use the version of the library in the build tree. \n\nOf course sage's spkg install before testing, which is a bit goofy but that's another argument, so it may not feel relevant. But we are dealing with stuff that is a bit more complicated like `gf2x`'s tuning. For `gf2x`'s tuning to work, you actually need to use a version of the library that you haven't installed yet. In that context, unless you remove the old `gf2x` first, you cannot re-run the install of `gf2x` properly. That's probably the only case for standard packages, Dima would have mentioned any other one on the freeBSD support ticket (basically this branch would enable the current behavior observed on freeBSD).",

After looking up some more stuff as part of discussion we are also having regarding gf2x upcoming release, stuff on freeBSD and other libtool matters. I now think disabling `disable-new-dtags` may actually bring more harm than good.

Without it `DT_RUNPATH` is not present in the elf file. Just `DT_RPATH`, which means that `DT_RPATH` has priority look up over `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. That doesn't seem to be a problem until you realise how libtool wraps binaries to be able run the `make check` target with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or equivalent) to make sure you use the version of the library in the build tree. 

Of course sage's spkg install before testing, which is a bit goofy but that's another argument, so it may not feel relevant. But we are dealing with stuff that is a bit more complicated like `gf2x`'s tuning. For `gf2x`'s tuning to work, you actually need to use a version of the library that you haven't installed yet. In that context, unless you remove the old `gf2x` first, you cannot re-run the install of `gf2x` properly. That's probably the only case for standard packages, Dima would have mentioned any other one on the freeBSD support ticket (basically this branch would enable the current behavior observed on freeBSD).

E.g. Fedora defaults to `disable-new-dtags` so it has to work; The only question is whether or not we want to support both.

IMHO gf2x is just unnecessarily playing it on hard mode; Shared libraries with the same version number are supposed to be interchangeable. Why use shared libraries for tuning?

It does work. And you'll get correct results on the first install.

Well they are technically interchangeable, they expose the same API, they just have different internals during tuning to find the best internals. You are right, using static libraries would solve the problem, but you would probably have to rethink the way it is built and tuned.
Like I said you, will have the correct result on first install, on subsequent installs or upgrade you will have to remove the old installed library to get the correct tuning.

I won't oppose the change if you, Jeroen and Erik think it is the way to go. But I think having the conversation and understanding some of the implications was necessary.
