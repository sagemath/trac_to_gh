The class `UniqueFactory` (see `src/sage/structure/factory.pyx`) has a strange way of implementing `__reduce__` for the created objects:

```
            obj._factory_data = self, version, key, extra_args
            if obj.__class__.__reduce__.__objclass__ is object:
                # replace the generic object __reduce__ to use this one
                obj.__reduce_ex__ = types.MethodType(generic_factory_reduce, obj)
```
It dynamically sets the `__reduce_ex__` attribute on the *instance* to implement pickling.

This breaks with Cython 0.26 because Cython 0.26 implements `__reduce__` for extension types, so the check `obj.__class__.__reduce__.__objclass__ is object` becomes almost always false.
