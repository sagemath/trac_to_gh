Hello,

I'm not sure that the term `spanning tree` is the best choice. A rooted directed spanning tree is usually called an `out-branching` in digraph theory.

I have several comments, but not enough time today. Only a few below.

To test if we can reach every other vertex from the source, you can simply do:

```
if len(list(self.depth_first_search(source))) < self.order():
    return
```


For initialization of `list_of_edges_to_keep` (and same idea in other places)

```
for i,(u,v) in enumerate(list_of_edges):
    if v != source and u != v:
        list_of_edges_to_keep.append((u, v, [i]))
```

Don't use `xrange` but `range`.

etc.

Let's go back to what you have proposed.

In your code, you have a complex use of indexes to cope with multi edges.

Actually, what you are doing, and this is the correct approach, is:
1. find an out-branching T in the digraph without labels
2. enumerate all possible out-branching that you can obtain from T using combinations of labels
3. goto step 1

To ease the readability of your code, I propose to proceed as follows:
1. build a data structure (a dictionary) keyed by pairs (u,v), so without labels, containing the list of labeled edges. That is, `dico[u,v] = [(u, v, label1), (u, v, label2)]`
2. find out-branchings T without labels. 
3. When you have an out-branching, enumerate all labeled out-branchings using the `product` operator and the dictionary `edge without label -> list of labeled edges`


Note that the out-branching without labels is exactly the list of the edges you have contracted.


In your code, you have chosen to contract edges. Clearly it eases the selection of the next edge to consider (you can use `graph.outgoing_edge_iterator(source)`). The drawback is that you may create loops or multiple edges, and that you have to perform many operations to deal with those edges and also undo the contractions.
You could instead maintain 2 graphs:
* The first one, G, is a copy of ``self`` without loops/multiedges/labels. On this graph you can only remove and put back the current edge
* The second one, T, is the current out-branching. So you add in it the current edge and later remove that edge.
So doing, the maintenance is much easier. You can use `G.edge_boundary(T.vertices())` to find the next edge.

Let me know if you have questions.

First of all thank you for the feedback !
\\
\\
We implemented the recommendations you made on comment 4 and stole some ideas from your solution that improved our algorithm a lot.
\\
\\
We took some time before answering because we wanted to compare both algorithms.
 
We then made some tests with different graphs (based on the following code)


```
from contextlib import contextmanager
from timeit import default_timer

@contextmanager
def elapsed_timer():
    start = default_timer()
    elapser = lambda: default_timer() - start
    yield lambda: elapser()
    end = default_timer()
    elapser = lambda: end-start

D = digraphs.RandomDirectedGNP(50, .08)

x = D.arborescence_iterator(0)
with elapsed_timer() as e:
    for eee in range(100000):
        x.next().size(),
print e()

x = D.spanning_trees(0)
with elapsed_timer() as e:
    for eee in range(100000):
        x.next().size(),
print e()
```

This test gives us 185 seconds for your solution and 107 seconds for ours.

So we think that the last committed version might be more suitable than your solution or the previous one.

Concerning the name of our algorithm we found a lot of article using the term "spanning tree" while other use "arborescence"; therefore we do not think it is necessary to change it.

Anyway, thanks again for your feedback it helped us a lot.

We will make sure to apply the modifications you suggest.

But we are not sure that we fully understand what you mean by :

- to ease termination test, you could pass an argument (depth) to the `_rec_spanning_trees` method so that the final test becomes `if depth == 0`:

Do you want to replace `if(len(list_merged_edges)) == self.order()-1` by a test on a parameter `depth` gave to `_rec_spanning_trees` method ?

Exactly. The first call is with `self.order()-1` and then each recursive call is with `depth-1` (or a more suitable name).

**General comments:**

- All comments must be formatted in 80 columns mode. You can certainly configure your editor for that
- `The spanning trees are rooted in the vertex source and directed from source to leaves.` -> `The spanning trees are rooted at  vertex ``source`` and edges are directed from source to leaves.`

-            - :meth:`~sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.spanning_trees_count`$

```

- In tests and examples, avoid empty lines before `::`. Can be placed directly at the end of the line

- we can avoid calling twice method `outgoing_edge_iterator` as follows

```diff

```

- Prefer `(u, v, l)` to `(u,v,l)`, `self.order() - 1` to `self.order()-1`,  `D.add_edge(u, v, (i,))` to `D.add_edge(u,v,(i,))`, 


**Terminology:**

I understand the use of spanning trees in this context and it is a counter part of the method for undirected graphes. However, I don't think it is the correct terminology in directed graphs. More precisely, [1] defines out-branchings as trees rooted at a vertex u with all vertices of in-degree 1 (so all edges directed from source to leaves) and similarly in-branchings. Such a branching is not necessarily spanning, and so we can use the term `spanning out branching`.

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory)


**Todo:**
- The current code iterates over spanning out branchings. Why not also iterating over spanning in branchings ?
- add iterator over in and out branchings

This part is quite unclear to me.
Are you suggesting that we should write another method `spanning_in_branching`, which will return a directed tree in which there is path from each vertex to source?

Exactly. Observe that in such branching, each vertex except the source (in fact a target) has out degree 1.

Ok, I got it now.
But how do you propose to check whether source is accesible from each vertex?
Either we can check the following condition `len(list(self.reverse().depth_first_search(source))==self.order())`
or 
we can implement modified version of DFS in our method specifically for this purpose.

- the patchbot reports a pyflakes error as itertools.chain is not used

```diff
-from itertools import product, chain
+from itertools import product
```

- Format all documentation and comments of your methods in 80 columns mode

- We can improve the definition

```diff
-        The spanning out branching are rooted in the vertex ``source`` and directed from source to leaves.
+        An out-branching is a directed tree rooted at ``source`` whose arcs are directed from source to
+        leaves. An out-branching is spanning if it contains all vertices of the digraph. 
``` 

- and also

```diff
-        If no spanning out branching exist, return nothing.
+        If no spanning out branching rooted at ``source`` exist, return nothing.
```

- `spanning out branches` -> `spanning out branchings`

- We try to comply with the PEP8 style guide for Python code [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ ]. So,
  - `D.delete_edge(u,v,l)` -> `D.delete_edge(u, v, l)`
  - `(u,v)` -> `(u, v)`

- instead of `depth -= 1` and later `depth += 1`, you can change the call to `_rec_spanning_out_branchings(depth - 1)`

- Instead of returning nothing if the source is not a vertex of the digraph, we should raise an error and adapt doctests accordingly. 

```
    if not self.has_vertex(source):
        raise ValueError("vertex ({0}) is not a vertex of the digraph".format(source))
```


- I propose the following simpler code

```diff
-        # We build a copy of the current Digraph removing loops and edges 
-        # coming in sources
-        # We give to every edge a label corresponding to its index in the list 
-        # of edges of the current digraph
-        D = DiGraph(multiedges=True, loops=True)
-        list_edges = self.edges()
-        depth = self.order() - 1
-        # Adding edges in D with label corresponding to index of that edge in
-        # self.edges()
-        for i,(u, v, _) in enumerate(list_edges):
-            if u != v and v != source:
-                D.add_edge(u, v, (i,))
-        list_merged_edges = set()
-        return _rec_spanning_out_branchings(depth)
+       # We build a copy of self in which each edge has a distinct label.
+       # On the way, we remove loops and edges incoming to source.
+        D = DiGraph(multiedges=True, loops=True)
+        for i, (u, v) in enumerate(self.edges(labels=False, sort=False)):
+            if u != v and v != source:
+                D.add_edge(u, v, (i,))
+        list_merged_edges = set()
+        return _rec_spanning_out_branchings(self.order() - 1)
```


- similar changes have to be done for `spanning_in_branching`.

- don't forget to add the methods to the top tables of the file.
- Also, check that the documentation builds well and displays properly.

- alignment

```diff
-        - ``source`` -- vertex used as the source for all spanning out 
-        branchings.
+        - ``source`` -- vertex used as the source for all spanning out 
+          branchings.
```

- I did a mistake in last review when I proposed to remove `list_edges` It is effectively needed and more efficient. Indeed, now `.edges` returns a `EdgesView` and asking for the `i`-th edge takes time `O(i)` instead of constant time with a list. So, you have to do:

```diff
-                    yield DiGraph([self.edges(sort=False)
-                                     [index] for index in indexes],
-                                      format='list_of_edges',
-                                      pos=self.get_pos())
+                    yield DiGraph([list_edges[index] for index in indexes],
+                                     format='list_of_edges',
+                                     pos=self.get_pos())
```
  and

```diff
-        for i, (u, v) in enumerate(self.edges(labels=False, sort=False)):
+        list_edges = list(self.edges(labels=False, sort=False))
+        for i, (u, v) in enumerate(list_edges):
```

- FYI: you can write `merged_multiple_edges[(u, v)]` or `merged_multiple_edges[u, v]`

- The 80 columns mode is mandatory for documentation, not for the code. 

```diff
-                D.add_edges([(u, v, l)
-                                for (u, v),l in merged_multiple_edges.items()])
+                D.add_edges([(u, v, l) for (u, v),l in merged_multiple_edges.items()])
```

```diff
-            raise ValueError("vertex ({0}) is not a vertex of the digraph"\
-                .format(source))
+            raise ValueError("vertex ({0}) is not a vertex of the digraph".format(source))
```


- Same comments for the second method.

Note also that I'm currently unable to build the documentation, at least due to the first bullet above.

Yeah, Code works fine with digraph of multiple edges. Because in code, while making a copy of `self` in digraph D we are adding edges with label `(i,)` where i is index of that edge in `self.edges()` and since `(i,)` is a tuple object so multiple labels will concatenate.

Thanks for pointing that out. It was returning an empty digraph for Digraph with singleton vertex.
I have fixed that. But, now it is returning a Digraph containing that vertex and not a generator object.
Can you suggest me something for that purpose?

On doing this, test of empty Digraph fails.

```
sage: G = DiGraph()
sage: G.order()
0
sage: G.spanning_out_branching(0)
<generator object DiGraph.spanning_out_branching at 0x7f9a4892c4f8>
```
It should have thrown error here instead.

```
sage: list(G.spanning_out_branching(0))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   3398 
   3399         # check if the source can access to every other vertex

ValueError: vertex (0) is not a vertex of the digraph

```
And this throws error. 
I am unable to understand this behavior. Any suggestions will be helpful.

I have added a small function which will be called only for digraph with a singleton vertex.
Now the code works fine.

I think it will consume more time, firstly making copy of `self` then relabelling that copy.

I don't see why `_singleton_spanning` needs to be a separate function. It is equivalent to the change resulting in

```
yield D
return
```

I am having trouble in relabeling multiedges since our code needs edge label to be of tuple (or any other type allowing concatenation).

Separating out multiedge during initial construction won't work because during recursion it might be possible that graph formed by merging vertices have multiedges.

First of all, the flow of operations should be something like:
1. deal with empty graph -> return nothing
2. check that the source is in the graph. If not, raise error
3. Deal with graphs of order 1 (singleton)
4. check that all vertices can be reached. If not, raise error
5. call recursive method

Concerning the idea of making a copy of the graph.
- It can hardly be done inside the recursive method due to the creation of new multi-edges when merging vertices
- However, if the input graph has multiple edges, we could make a simple copy of it (without loops / multi edges), then call the recursive method, and on the way back yield all possible labelings of edges that are based on the same graph.

Another idea, to make the method more general is to add it an optional parameter `spanning` default to `True`, so that the method can also yield non spanning out branchings. Then, when this parameter is true, we check that all vertices can be reached. Otherwise, we initialize the `depth` parameter with the number of vertices that can be reached and possibly work only on the subgraph containing only these vertices.

When you check if the order is 1, there is no need to check if the graph has the vertex. Already done before.
And there is no need for a specific method. It can be done in the else part.

You don't check if the graph is empty and actually there is no need for it as the empty graph cannot have the source vertex.

One solution is to decide if an out-branching can be a single vertex.

`@`tscrim: what do you think ?


Since we now have parameter `spanning`,  we can remove `spanning_` from method names.

For isolated source and `spanning=False` it was returning an empty generator object. I have corrected that

And removed the term `spanning` wherever it was unnecessary.

I pushed a new branch with few review edits. The branch is in `public/` so you can modify it if needed. 

I have renamed the methods `out_branchings` and `in_branchings`.

If you agree with the current branch, I will then set it to positive review. Let me know.
