There's a typo in the `greedy` function; the following should be the same.

```
sage: S = ClusterSeed(Matrix([[0,1],[-4,0]])); S
A seed for a cluster algebra of rank 2
sage: S.greedy(1,2)
(x1^4 + x0^2 + 2*x0 + 1)/(x0*x1^2)
sage: S.greedy(1,2,'by_combinatorics')
(x0*x1^4 + x1^4 + x0^2 + 2*x0 + 1)/(x0*x1^2)
```
