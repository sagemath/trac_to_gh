<a id='comment:3'></a>First, some general things:

- don't include the helper file in the documentation (rst)

- also do not add the pyx extension since the helper functions aren't exposed to the user

- I'd add to the ticket description that this is the first of a series improving the complex dynamics functionality.
 
---

for the .py file

- OUTPUT: - isn't this a .bmp or an interact?

- kwds go under an INPUT: section

- add some readability spacing, such as after , for arguments

```
kwds.pop("x_center", -1.0)
```

- I don't understand the section 'NOTEBOOK EXAMPLES:'. Seems like this is all self-explanatory from the kwds description. The actual function call examples are needed, but they should be in an EXAMPLES: section

- I would add some to more the general function description:
  - what is the mandelbrot set
  - how are you computing it (perhaps a very basic ALGORITHM: section)

---

for the .pyx file

- I don't think you need the initial underscore (that marks it as a private function that won't appear in tab completion) since it is not exposed to the user anyway.

- need one line description of function

- why not a cdef?

- OUTPUT - isn't this a .bmp

- The examples fail because you need to import the function first

```
sage: from sage.dynamics.complex_dynamics.mandel_julia_helper import _fast_mandel_plot
```

- bug: negative image_width flips the image instead of gives an error

---
a couple functionality thoughts:

for interact:

- I'd let the user adjust pretty much anything

- I still don't really like the width slider. How about a input box?

for colors: the contour levels are not great by default. I was playing around with it and the best I could come up with using basically the same system was as follows

have two parameters
- number of iterations between levels (default to 1)

- number of colors to use

you'll need to do better with your nested ifs. For example

```
cdef int level
if iteration != max_iteration:
    level = iteration/level_sep
    
if level < color_num:
    pixel[row,col] = color_list[level]
else:
    pixel[row,col] = color_list[-1]
```
This gave me pretty good control over the contours and I got a nice grey-scale image with base_color [50,50,50] with level_sep=1 and 20 colors gradations. This has the advantage of disengaging it from the max_iterations. So you can increase the detail without messing up the contours.

I'll leave the default color choice to you, but at least consider gray scale since it should allow a 'white' external ray to show up well.

<a id='comment:9'></a>I think the functionality works well now. I have a few code nitpicks and one suggestion for speedup.

You also need to resolve the current merge conflict

---

cython file:

import statements to top

line 89 too long

line 98: don't over do the spacing: 2*new_x*new_y + y_coor

add some comments describing what each code block is doing. for example, why are you reflecting about the x-axis. Are you trying to use that it is symmetrical? In that case you should be assigning two pixel values for each iteration and only looping through the top half of the pixels, but only when the real axis is contain in the image window.

speed ups: the quantities

image_width * (row-pixel_count / 2) / pixel_count
image_width * (col-pixel_count / 2) / pixel_count

are better off precomputed as step values

---

python file

reference should go in the main reference file: src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst

then you can reference it here as [Devaney]_

you also have several lines longer than the 80char standard. They should be wrapped.

several examples are missing the 'sage:' portion

imports to top of file

The plotting of the Julia set is what we plan to work on next after finishing up everything with the Mandelbrot set so we thought we should name the functions accordingly. I have not tried to use the interact functionality in anywhere besides the Sage notebook so I will be sure to try those out and make a note of it in the documentation. I am also not familiar with Sphinx so I will have to take a look at that. As far as a more general version of the function, we plan to get to that after we tackle Julia sets.\n\nThanks again,\n\nBen Barros\n\n\nReplying to [comment:13 kcrisman]:\n> Various comments I hope are useful:\n> * This branch doesn't apply to latest develop, apparently?\n> * Separately, it would be useful to know whether the interactive functionality works anywhere than in the SageNB notebook.

<a id='comment:15'></a>Thanks for the feedback! The plotting of the Julia set is what we plan to work on next after finishing up everything with the Mandelbrot set so we thought we should name the functions accordingly. I have not tried to use the interact functionality in anywhere besides the Sage notebook so I will be sure to try those out and make a note of it in the documentation. I am also not familiar with Sphinx so I will have to take a look at that. As far as a more general version of the function, we plan to get to that after we tackle Julia sets.

Thanks again,

Ben Barros

<a id='comment:18'></a>An easy fix: lighter not darker for more iterations

I understand preventing the huge html ones from running in the EXAMPLES so that the user isn't bombarded. It is good that they are there so the user can see how to call the function with various parameters. But why are the non-interact ones blocked as well? It seems that you just add them later in TESTS section. I'd just put them in the example section and let them run.

Do you still need to add the 'Extension' for importing the .pyx? Since those are now private functions, I didn't think you needed that anymore.

I can't say I like the interact html tests. Maybe post a question to sage-devel about how to test an interact with a doctest, or even if you should be trying to.

<a id='comment:33'></a>This is looking good, I just have a couple minor nitpicks.

- in the INPUT
  - you have f(z) in max_iteration instead of Q_c(z)  (both files)
  - interact to false is not just for outside the notebook(in the .py file)


- I thought you were going to change the default for interact to False

- line 78 of .pyx : initialize misspelled

- It took me a little bit to figure out why your y_step uses -y_center. Then I realized that it isn't really the y_step, that is scale_factor. Rather x_step, y_step represent the upper left hand corner of the image. And scale_factor really is the step_size. Then you are using the x-axis symmetry of the image. Any reason, you are not just using the correct y coordinate?  Why don't you just use

```
y_step = y_center + image_width/2
y_coor = y_step - col*scale_factor
```
- I also suggest renaming those variables to match their purpose and making a comment that you are starting at the upper left hand corner of the image.

- line 102: sig_check not needed (you already check in the inside loop)
