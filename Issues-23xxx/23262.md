Trying to replace `AC_CHECK_LIBS` with `AC_CHECK_LIB` or `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` does not work either.

OK, i updated to 1.2.3-47 and replaced with `AC_CHECK_LIBS` with `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` in the patch, but without success.

OK, i just merged with the lastest beta to ease compilation, and changed the dependency.

Since #22280 is not merged yet, i add it as a dependency.

For me it is good to go, in the sense that compilation and tests pass on 64bit and 32bit Linux machines. I am not able to check the contents of the patch however.

If you or François are OK with that i let you mark it positive review.
