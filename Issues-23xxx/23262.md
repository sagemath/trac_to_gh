In #22101, png support was removed from `giac` to fix a build issue. Let us try to re-enable it, with suggestions from #22280.


Depends on #22280

As suggested in [/22280#comment:63] i (blindly) replaced 

```
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(png.h, AC_CHECK_LIB(png,main))
```

with 

```
AC_CHECK_HEADERS(png.h, AC_CHECK_LIBS(main,[png16,png14,png12,png]))
```

in `configure.ac` but i get an error:

```
[giac-1.2.3.25] configure.in:103: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_CHECK_LIBS
[giac-1.2.3.25]       If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
[giac-1.2.3.25]       See the Autoconf documentation.
[giac-1.2.3.25] Makefile:364: recipe for target 'configure' failed
```

Trying to replace `AC_CHECK_LIBS` with `AC_CHECK_LIB` or `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` does not work either.

1) we are at 1.2.3-47 not 1.2.3-25.
2) Didn't read properly https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Libraries.html the other night, it should be AC_SEARCH_LIBS you are right.
3) hum this `configure.in` which is obsolete, not `configure.ac`, I wonder if it is important.

I'll have a go at patching in the morning if you don't have success by then.

OK, i updated to 1.2.3-47 and replaced with `AC_CHECK_LIBS` with `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` in the patch, but without success.

> I'll have a go at patching in the morning if you don't have success by then.

OK, do not hesitate to modify the branch, this stuff is beyond my competences.

Replying to [@jpflori](#comment:9):
> Yes you're right.

OK, i just merged with the lastest beta to ease compilation, and changed the dependency.

Since #22280 is not merged yet, i add it as a dependency.

For me it is good to go, in the sense that compilation and tests pass on 64bit and 32bit Linux machines. I am not able to check the contents of the patch however.

If you or François are OK with that i let you mark it positive review.
