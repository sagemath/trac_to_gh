Well it looks to me like this is all a bit of a mess really.  According to the docs:

> `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` - if set to a number, then when building the documentation, parallel doctesting, or running `sage -b`, use this many threads. If this is not set, then determine the number of threads using the value of the `MAKE` (see above) or `MAKEFLAGS` environment variables. If none of these specifies a number of jobs, use one thread (except for parallel testing: there we use a default of the number of CPU cores, with a maximum of 8 and a minimum of 2).


But in reality `sage-runtests` doesn't use any of this, and instead checks `SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL` which is set in `sage-env` using the `sage-num-threads.py` script (???).  `SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL` isn't documented anywhere, much less as the way to set the default number of processes to use for sage-runtests -p`.

I don't understand what the distinction between `SAGE_NUM_THREADS` and `SAGE_NUM_THREADS_PARALLEL` is supposed to be (the use of "threads" is a bit misleading too, though you could at least argue that each process has a main thread...).

Point being, there's no well-documented way to control how many processes to use when running `make ptest`, and this adds at least *a* way that's more or less consistent with what's documented.

I don't think it's so bad. The script `sage-num-threads.py` is where all decisions regarding number of threads/processes are made. Other parts of Sage (like the doctester) use the output of that script. I think the script itself is reasonably documented.

Now that I understand, I don't think it's so bad either.  Just not obvious.
