<a id='comment:12'></a>The ticket is coming along very nicely. Some preliminary comments.

- In docs, prefer "Return the ..." over "Returns the ...". I personally prefer "this matrix" over the less specific "the matrix" when talking about `self`. I would even use `this polynomial matrix` if I need to set it apart from e.g. an integer or scalar matrix.

- `degree`, doc: "If the matrix is zero, this is a nonnegative integer" - do you mean "this is `-\infty`"?.

- `degree`: why does the 0x0 matrix have degree `None`? Such a matrix has e.g. rank 0 and characteristic polynomial 1. Similar question for `row-degree`.

- `degree_matrix`: I would prefer that you add a parameter check that the shift is a list of the right length. One could interpret the doc text as expecting the shift to be a vector of integers - is this a problem?

- `degree_matrix`, examples: a long line needs wrapping.

- About references: we don't have as high standards wrt. completeness of referencing all previous history as in journal publications. In fact, for a concept like `row_degree` I think Sage rarely has references - they are mostly used for algorithms. So I think 1 reference is plenty sufficient. I like your intention of drawing the reader to the related concept of `defect` but this maybe has most value if properly explained?

  In any case, references have to be entered in the special file `$SAGE/src/doc/en/reference/references/index.rst` and referred to using the syntax `[Kai80]`.
 
- `leading_matrix`, doc: Could you make a shorter explanation for the unshifted case first? I then prefer to define `LM_s(M) := LM(M diag(x<sup>{s_1},...,x</sup>{s_n})` which I find easier to parse.

- `leading_matrix`: I don't think the `self[i,j] == 0 or` requirements are necessary in each of the four cases.

- `is_reduced` doc: first line, consider putting parentheses around "shifted". And later: "Equivalently, when considering ... left-multiplying", add "(resp. right-multiplying)".

- `pivot`: should the pivot degrees only be returned if the user wishes it (by setting a flag `return_degree=False`)?

- `is_ordered_weak_popov`: should this be merged with `is_weak_popov` by giving the latter an optional flag `ordered`?

<a id='comment:14'></a>Thank you for your numerous comments.

All that is not commented below was taken into account in the last revision.

Replying to [comment:12 jsrn]:
> - `degree`: why does the 0x0 matrix have degree `None`? Such a matrix has e.g. rank 0 and characteristic polynomial 1. Similar question for `row-degree`.


This is a good question and I have no answer. Another choice would be `-1`, but so far I see no reason to prefer one or the other. Do you?

> - `degree_matrix`: I would prefer that you add a parameter check that the shift is a list of the right length.


I was hesitating about such a parameter check. If we put one here, then we should do it for every method involving a shift, right?

> One could interpret the doc text as expecting the shift to be a vector of integers - is this a problem?


I don't think this is a problem (if I understand well your question): we can input a vector (1,2,3) or a list [1,2,3], both will work.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Hi, looking better and better :-)

- `leading_matrix`, perhaps elsewhere: Don't put parentheses around the condition of an if-statement
- Prefer `a is None` compared to `a == None`.
- Class doc: forget `:meth:` for `leading_matrix` reference.

Things we discussed face2face:
- pivot -> leading_positions
- add order_by_degree and order_by_leading_position
- Raise ValueError on zero-row or zero-column matrices
- Check lengths of shifts everywhere

<a id='comment:25'></a>Hi Vincent,

I've carefully gone over the entire file now and I like it - we're almost there. I took the liberty to implement directly some smaller fixes, and also to use this ticket to include some improvements to existing docs and examples in that file. Please review these changes.

As to your changes, I'm ready to green light everything except for the following comments:

- What's the point of `is_empty_popov`? Why not just implement the empty case in `is_*_popov`? If you only have the method for this reason, then the function shoulde be hidden (i.e. start with an underscore). Besides, I find the convention strange: a 2*n matrix can be in Popov form for any n>0 (if n=1 then the second row must be zero for it to be in Popov form). Why disallow 2*0 matrices to be in Popov form?

- I'm thinking that the `is_hermite` argument `lower_echelon` is overkill. I'm
  not firm on this point since you already implemented it, but is it really
  useful? Just because not all papers ever agreed on this minor point doesn't
  mean we should support it everywhere. If the user really wants to, he can
  easily flip all the rows himself by
  `M.permute_rows(Permutation(range(M.nrows(),0,-1)))`.

- If you keep `lower_echelon=True`, there should be an example using it where
  the answer is `True`.

Also, I like your fix for allowing other row orderings in `is_popov`!

Best,
Johan

<a id='comment:26'></a>Oh yeah, I also merged in 24640 since I was worried about a conflict. There seems to have been no conflict with 24640 itself, so technically, I should remove that merge, but there was a conflict with some other parts of rebasing this patch to a newer version of Sage.

It is indeed used in is_reduced, is_weak_popov, and is_popov. So I wrote it only once. Now it is hidden (and it does not check anymore that the input is indeed empty).
You are right that there were problems with some matrices; to make it behave like other is_* functions, I added a parameter "include_zero_vectors" (True by default, in which case any empty matrix is in shifted Popov form for any shift) and updated the code to reflect this.

It is in fact more complicated than this; it is not just a permutation, the two forms are actually quite different and can have very different degree profiles. Since both are in the literature and both seem to be used frequently, I really prefer keeping this optional argument.

Done!

This made me realise that there is a bug with zero rows in is_weak_popov. I will fix this today.

Ah, yes I see I was mistaken. But isn't it true that `H` is in upper-echelon Hermite form exactly when `JHJ` is in lower-echelon Hermite form, where `J` is the anti-diagonal unit matrix (i.e. `JHJ` is `H` with both columns and rows reversed). Equivalently, the upper-echelon Hermite form of `M` should be `JHJ` where `H` is the lower-echelon Hermite form of `JMJ`.

Note also that our current `hermite_form` algorithm does not support computing the upper-echelon variant. Are you planning to add that? (even if you're not, I'm not against keeping `lower_echelon` in `is_hermite`).

Best,

Argh... sorry.

>isn't it true that `H` is in upper-echelon Hermite form exactly when `JHJ` is in lower-echelon Hermite form, where `J` is the anti-diagonal unit matrix (i.e. `JHJ` is `H` with both columns and rows reversed).

Yes, I agree, this seems correct.

> Note also that our current `hermite_form` algorithm does not support computing the upper-echelon variant. Are you planning to add that? (even if you're not, I'm not against keeping `lower_echelon` in `is_hermite`).

In fact the current code computes the upper echelon and not the lower, and I am among the ones preferring the lower, this is what led me to put this option in is_hermite despite the existing code.

So I am considering adding support for lower echelon in `hermite_form`, simply by making sure your remark above is correct and using it in the straightforward way (if lower echelon, then start by replacing M by JMJ, run the current code, and then finish by replacing H by JHJ).
Does this sound ok?

Best,
Vincent

<a id='comment:40'></a>Hey Vincent,

I have started to review your code and I want to give you my first comment since I don't know when I will have time to continue the review.
First of all, your code is really nice to read, so thank you for your contribution

## General Comments

Add your name as author ?

You should have created multiple small tickets, possibly one by small group of
functions

Why import `from sage.matrix.matrix2 cimport Matrix` if `sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix` is never used ?
However, it may be faster to call directly `sage.matrix.matrix2.Matrix` instead of 
`sage.matrix.constructor.Matrix`.

Tests fail (see Continuous integration) in src/sage/coding/ because of deprecated row_reduced_form

```
sage -t src/sage/coding/extended_code.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/coding/guruswami_sudan/gs_decoder.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/coding/guruswami_sudan/interpolation.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t src/sage/coding/bch.py  # 1 doctest failed
```

## _check_shift_dimension

What is the point of argument 'shifts' being optional ? If you check shifts
dimension, you should provide shifts.

## column_degrees

You should have a code closer to row_degrees, which is cleaner. In particular, please remove 
`if self.nrows() == 0: ...` on line 354

## leading_matrix

Suggestion:
I am not sure that the part "Going over the Laurent polynomials" is useful to
understand the behavior of the function. It is important scientifically to
manipulate leading matrices, in particular for understanding the leading matrix
of the product, but not so much for its definition.

## reduced_form
You should add documentation about option "row_wise"

Best, Romain

<a id='comment:42'></a>Hey Vincent,

here is the second and final part of my review. I really like your contribution and I appreciate the effort that you have put into it !

Here are my comments suggestions

## _is_empty_popov

l501

```
if not include_zero_vectors:
   return True
```
should be

```
if include_zero_vectors:
   return True
```

Also your tests should capture this behavior.

## is_reduced

* l518 with $k \leq n$ -> with $k \leq m$ ?
* l525 with $k \leq m$ -> with $k \leq n$ ?

* l578 `return self._is_empty_popov(row_wise)`

  I'm not able to tell if it is correct or if it should be 
  `return self._is_empty_popov(row_wise,include_zero_vectors)`

* l609 "The definition is similar if working column-wise"

  It would be nice to mention here too that "we choose bottommost entry in case of
  degree equality"


## leading_positions

* l594 "(also known as the pivot index)" -> pivot indices
 
* l594 pivot degree ->  pivot degrees

* idem l772

* l602 "Then the pivot degree of the vector is the degree $\deg(p_j)$"

  Is it really $\deg(p_j)$ or should it be $\deg(p_j) + s_j$ instead ?

## is_weak_popov

l772 pivot index -> pivot indices

## is_popov

l957  `not up_to_permutation,`

I don't understand why you negate up_to_permutation here. Can you please check ?

## is_hermite

Maybe copy the sentence at l74 "In fact, if $d$ is the largest degree ..."
relating Popov and Hermite at the end of the comments of the function

Is the "+ 1" in lines 1071 and 1073 really necessary ?

== weak_popov_form==

l1096 If this **is** ``True``

Is there a good reason to not implement option row_wise here ?

== reduced_form==

Should add documentation about option "row_wise"

l1291 `If this **is** ``True```

Best,

Romain

I am not familiar with this: this was already imported in this file prior to that ticket. To avoid breaking something that others wrote, I prefer leaving it as is... but please advise me if you are certain of a solution to make this point cleaner.

This was corrected, thank you. Now, 'shifts' must be given, and is still allowed to be 'None' because this happens to be convenient in other functions.

Thank you for the suggestion; I agree that this is not essential here and does not add much to the first definition given in the documentation. To make the documentation easier to follow, I removed this remark.

Done, thank you for noticing.

I'll continue right now with your other batch of remarks.

What you suggest is correct too (the number of nonzero rows is obviously at most m). The fact that the number of nonzero rows must be at most the number n of columns is because a row reduced matrix represents a basis of some submodule of length-n polynomial vectors (such a submodule is free and its basis has at most n elements).

Oh, big mistake, now corrected. Thank you for noticing.

I think what is written is correct. What you suggest is correct too (the number of nonzero rows is obviously at most m). The fact that the number of nonzero rows must be at most the number n of columns is because a row reduced matrix represents a basis of some submodule of length-n polynomial vectors (such a submodule is free and its basis has at most n elements). In some papers the definition of reduced does not require this, but then it becomes relatively more complicated and makes it more difficult to manipulate reduced forms, while it is not clear to me what advantages this more general definition could bring except possibly in very particular cases.

This should be the latter version indeed, thank you.

There has been a small discussion with Johan on this; in the literature there is a mix of singular and plural. The 'pivot degree' is a tuple of pivot degrees... anyway, for me both are fine, and since we used plural for 'positions' I suppose we should use plural for indices/degrees.

The pivot degree is the actual degree of the polynomial, and if you add the shift this would be the (shifted) row degree. Both are useful.

The argument `ordered` of `is_weak_popov` will require that the leading positions are strictly increasing; so it should be false when we are testing that the matrix is in Popov form up to row permutation (and true otherwise).

I incorporated this remark, than you for the suggestion.
 
> Is the "+ 1" in lines 1071 and 1073 really necessary ?

Yes, because of the way we choose leading positions (rightmost nonzero), and because there is an option to have the upper triangular row-wise Hermite form. For example, working row-wise and with upper-triangular Hermite, a 2x2 matrix with rows `[X  X]` and `[1  X^2]` is (2,0)-Popov but not Hermite; so if we used this shift (2,0) instead of (2+1,0) (where 2 is the degree of the matrix), the Hermite test relying on (2,0)-Popov form would give a wrong answer.

Corrected, thank you!

This was considered out of the scope of this ticket, since there is anyway some work to be done on these reduction functions (adding Popov form, cleaning existing code using the new functions...).

Corrected, thank you!

Now, the function computes either a row reduced form or a column reduced form, depending on the optional parameter `row_wise` (default: true). Most other functions are like this in this file; it seemed better and more compact than always having two extremely similar functions named `row_X` and `column_X` . There might be other solutions we did not think of...

I think that your comment on line 992 had me confused:

"Note that, if $d$ is the largest degree appearing in the Hermite form, then the Hermite form coincide with the shifted Popov form with the shifts $(0,d,2d,\ldots,(n-1)d)$, where $n$ is the column dimension."

Is it really $d$ or should it be $d+1$ in this comment ?

I see: in this comment, the "shifted Popov form" is understood as the lower triangular row-wise one, or as the upper triangular column-wise one. For the two others (upper triangular row-wise and lower triangular column-wise), these forms do not coincide anymore as showed by the example in my previous answer; the difference comes from the way pivots are chosen (rightmost nonzero for row-wise, bottommost nonzero for column-wise).

My suggestion is to make this more clear on line 992, as follows:
"Note that, working row-wise, if $d$ is the largest degree appearing in the Hermite form, then the Hermite form coincides with the shifted Popov form with the shifts $(0,d,2d,\ldots,(n-1)d)$, where $n$ is the column dimension. (This is valid with lower triangular Hermite forms; if working row-wise but with upper triangular Hermite forms, one would need to take $d+1$ in the shifts instead of $d$.)"

Would this remove any confusion?

Hi Vincent, thank you for the explanation, it is now clear for me. I would suggest that you keep it simple in the comments : take $d$ (strictly) greater than all degrees in the matrix (so d would be "d+1") and shifts $(0,d,2d,\ldots,(n-1)d)$.

Best,

Ok, I have chosen this solution which is indeed simpler.

Great!
However I am still unsure about line 1070

` shift = [j*self.degree() + 1 for j in range(self.ncols())] `

which gives [1, d + 1, 2*d + 1, 3*d + 1, ...] with d the degree. It does not seem coherent with what we said ; I seems to me that it should be 

` shift = [j*(self.degree() + 1) for j in range(self.ncols())] `

Oh... you are totally right. This is a bug, thank you for noticing. Adding 1 to all entries of the shift is useless concerning normal forms and so this shift is equivalent to (0,d,2d,...). Which is not right: I have just actually tested my example above, of a matrix which is not even triangular, and it does wrongly return `True` :

```
sage: pR.<x> = GF(7)[]
sage: M = Matrix(pR,2,2,[[x,x],[1,x^2]])
sage: M
[  x   x]
[  1 x^2]
sage: M.is_popov(shifts=[2,0])
True
sage: M.is_hermite()  # defaut is row-wise upper triangular
True
```
The shift in this example should of course be (d+1,0) = (3,0), while the current code uses (d+1,1) = (3,1), which is equivalent to (2,0) and not the right one as we discussed above.

I'm going to fix this in a commit in a few seconds.

Thank you again.

      Vincent
