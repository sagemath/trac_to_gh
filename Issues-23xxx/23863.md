Jen and I wrote this wrapper:
https://github.com/edgarcosta/pycontrolledreduction

However, is not yet perfect.

For example, I need to do: 

```
from ctypes import * 
lib1 = cdll.LoadLibrary(SAGE_LOCAL+"/lib/libmpir.so.23")
```
before being able to do

```
from  pycontrolledreduction import controlledreduction
```
and because of that, I have not yet managed to run the doctest.


Further, I would think it would be a good option that this PyPI package to also compile and install https://github.com/edgarcosta/controlled-reduction
(but I don't know how to do that).
For example, by having it as a git submodule and then doing on the right directory

```
./configure --prefix=$SAGE_LOCAL && make install
```

Let me know your thoughts.
