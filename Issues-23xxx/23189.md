Currently this does not work:

```
sage: CyclotomicField(5).maximal_order().coerce_map_from(ZZ).is_injective()
NotImplementedError
```

This probably works if we switch over a `DefaultCoerceMap_unique` to have the right category set, i.e., with #23184.

Depends on #23184

**Keywords:** sd86.5

Is this still relevant?

```
sage: CyclotomicField(5).maximal_order().coerce_map_from(ZZ).is_injective()
True
```
