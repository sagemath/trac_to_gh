This patch will add the adjunct operation defined in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02489.pdf. The definition is not lattice-specific, i.e. could be defined to all posets. However this is implementation for lattices only; it is possible to extend it later.

Travis, how should one say this: "Adjunct [with|by] L [on|by] pair (a, b)."?

(No prepositions in my native language, these are hard for me.)

Can you add an example that explains the labeling change in more detail (and to show it works correctly)?

Also, typo:

```diff
-`(a, b)` of `L` if defined such that `x < y` if
+`(a, b)` of `L` is defined such that `x < y` if
