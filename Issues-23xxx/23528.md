Unicode that coerces to str is OK in terminal mode:

```
sage: table([ [u'test'] ])
  test
```

Unicode that coerces to str looks bad in html and latex mode{

```
sage: html(table([ [u'test'] ]))

<div class="notruncate">
<table  class="table_form">
<tbody>
<tr class ="row-a">
<td><script type="math/tex">\text{\texttt{test}}</script></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
```

Unicode that doesn't coerce to str booms:

```
sage: html(table([ [u'tæst'] ]))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UnicodeEncodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
...
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe6' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)
```
