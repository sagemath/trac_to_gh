Currently the test for CM (complex multiplication) is done via the cached function is_cm_j_invariant() in sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/cm.py.  After rejecting j which are not algebraic *integers* it goes straight into a fairly expensive test which requires finding all the CM j-invariants of the same degree h as the given j.  This is fast and cheap for low degree but rapidly gets more expensive, and relies completely on knowing all negative discriminants of class number h, which is only known for h up to 100.

A better test would be very easy, would eliminate essentially all non-CM j-invariants, and would give only one candidate fundamental discriminant:

1. Replace j by an element whose parent number field K is if exact degree h (in case the original parent field has higher degree).
2. Construct any elliptic curve E with this j.
3. For several primes P of K where E has good reduction and the trace a_P is nonzero, compute the square-free part of the discriminant of the Frobenius polynomial, i.e. `a_P**2-4*N(P)`.  This is fast since it only involves counting points mod P for small P, and we would restrict to P of degree 1 so the point-counting would be over prime fields.
4. If any two of these square-free parts are different then j is not CM.
5. If all are equal to -d (negative square-free) for many P then it is likely that j has CM by an order in Q(sqrt(-d)).  Find the class number of the maximal order and hence all orders whose class number is h.  (If none, then j is not CM).  Now we have probably only one, and at most a small number, of candidate CM discriminants, of the form `-d*f**2`.
6. Finally compute the Hilbert Class Polynomial for each `-d*f**2` and test if j is a root.  If so then we have CM and know the discriminant.  Otherwise j was not CM.
