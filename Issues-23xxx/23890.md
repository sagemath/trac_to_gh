No it is more I am keeping an eye on some of these. For my own reasons. For this one I was hoping I was not going to have to make an ebuild for Gentoo, but it looks like I will have to. 

Unlike cython, there are changes, and changes that I cannot brush off. I have already taken care of all previous sage versions in sage-on-gentoo so that they wouldn't allow the installation of this version of `six`.

I will give you a review in the next 24hours.

I don't think you should have removed the workaround code just yet, as now this requires any downstream systems to upgrade to six 1.11.  That said, I don't see any reason not to push that anyways.
