Trying

```
ZZ.ideal(2).absolute_norm()
```
raises a `NotImplementedError`.

However,

```
NumberField(var('y'),"a").ring_of_integers().ideal(2).absolute_norm()
```
works fine.

This should be an easy fix, but I'm not sure where is the right place to do it.

Interesting.  In `sage.rings.ideal.Ideal_generic`, `norm()` returns `self` while `absolute_norm` raises a `NotImplementedError`.  Maybe just update that function to return `self`?

That could be a solution, but somewhat, to me seems that `norm()` should also raise a `NotImplementedError`.

I'm leaning more towards returning `self.gen().norm()` and `self.gen(). absolute_norm()` for ideals in a PID.

What do you think?

That sounds reasonable to me.  Do you also want to define `relative_norm` to return `self`?

Most likely...

Alternatively, we could create a new class for ZZ ideals and QQ fractional ideals, see  #23595.
