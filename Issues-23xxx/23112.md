The script `src/bin/math-readline` (from #16703), which is used by the `Mathematica` pexpect interface and by `mathematica_console`, puts the terminal in a bad state (due to #20173). There is also this problem reported by John Palmieri:

If I run

```
   $ sage --sh
   $ math-readline
```
then 19 out of 20 times, it fails immediately, but every now and then, maybe when the computer is more heavily loaded, it does something else: it says

```
   /bin/sh: math: command not found
```
(as with the immediate failures) and then it waits for input.

The patch on this ticket:
- makes `math-readline` useful again for interactive use (this also repairs echoing of `mathematica_console`). 
- Changes the `Mathematica` pexpect interface so that it does not rely on a helper script any more.

With `math`, `mathematica('1+2')` hangs indefinitely.
IIRC, the reason is that there are no prompts, and consequently pexpect hangs.

If so, how would the `math-readline` script fix that? That script is not writing prompts.

I feel like the patch at #16703 is a bad work-around for the Mathematica issue that #16703 fixes.

Anyway, there is not much that I can do with Mathematica being closed source...

Without investigating further, I think that Mathematica is trying to be helpful and does not write prompts in "non-interactive" situations.
I do not know the precise mechanism. The math-readline script seems to trick Mathematica into interactive mode.

The strange thing is that `pexpect` is really supposed to be exactly like an interactive session. As far as the application is concerned, there should be no difference between a `pexpect` session or, say, an `xterm` or SSH session.

As far as the application is concerned, there should be no difference between a `pexpect` session or, say, an `xterm` or SSH session.\n\n\nI have investigated further and have implemented two solutions, which can be selected by `use_pipe=False` or `True`. In either mode, the `math-readline` script is no longer used by the `Mathematica` pexpect interface (except for `mathematica_console`). See comments in `mathematica.py` for more info. \n\nEliminating the use of a helper script also makes it more convenient to work with a remote Mathematica server and is also slightly faster.

I have investigated further and have implemented two solutions, which can be selected by `use_pipe=False` or `True`. In either mode, the `math-readline` script is no longer used by the `Mathematica` pexpect interface (except for `mathematica_console`). See comments in `mathematica.py` for more info. 

Eliminating the use of a helper script also makes it more convenient to work with a remote Mathematica server and is also slightly faster. I have tested with Mathematica 11 on Mac OS X, both locally and with `server=localhost`. 

This could use some testing on different platforms and with different Mathematica versions.

In a screen session, this just hangs. (`P.show()` hands too)

In terminal, it works---there is a "flashing" movement going through the display, as if it quickly pops something out and closes it.
And `P.show()` displays the graph. Don't know, it might be something to do with X11 in general, or X11 specifics on this particular host.

I don't really know why this happens, but it has to do with Mathematica
interaction, apparently. If I instead do

```
P=plot(sin(x))
P._rich_repr_(dm)
```
then it does work, outputting `OutputImagePng container`, as expected.

I'm not Dima, but I wish I was. :D I'm assuming you were talking to me.

I didn't think I would need to re-run `make` since it was a modification to a script in `bin`. After doing a `make` and trying again it worked.

I agree that it works fairly well. There are some issues with hitting `<tab>` (as I am too well-trained in tab-completion to not do it) and then backspacing, but that can be a follow-up ticket if it even is on our end.
