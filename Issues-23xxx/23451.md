(see #23448 for a different issue when /bin/sh is a recent dash)

Both `fflas-ffpack` and `linbox` packages seem to have issues.

- `fflas-ffpack`: this one doesn't give an error message, but in fact it installs a broken version of `local/include/fflas-ffpack/config.h` which produces a failure later on when compiling `linbox`

- `linbox`: creates a broken version of `linbox/config.h` and then the compilation fails

The symptom in both cases is that spurious characters (^A and ^B) appear in the files `fflas-ffpack/config.h` and `linbox/config.h`, thus causing errors in the compiler.

Sample line:

```
#define __FFLASFFPACK_^A ^B 
```

The root cause seems to be bad escaping of substitutions in sed (i.e. \1, \2, etc) which instead of substituting the captured text they become a literal \1 (^A) or \2 (^B), etc.

Since sage requires bash anyway, the easiest fix seems to be to force CONFIG_SHELL=bash when running configure for those two packages.

I think either way is ok.

One advantage of using the environment variable is: we could actually set `CONFIG_SHELL` globally so that the configure scripts for all packages are run using bash (maybe as provided by the user).

As a matter of fact, for my particular set up those two were the only two packages that needed to be run under bash.

I didn't test with the `sdh_*` scripts, but I would expect

```
export CONFIG_SHELL=whatever
./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL" --libdir="$SAGE_LOCAL/lib" blah
```

to be equivalent to

```
export CONFIG_SHELL=whatever
sdh_configure blah
```

as the "export" makes sure the variable is recursively inherited by subshells.
