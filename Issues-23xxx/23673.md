The generic implementation of map_coefficients for polynomials is in a Cython file, but can be considerably improved.

Without the new commit:

```
   sage: R.<x> = SR[]
   sage: p = prod(x+i for i in range(60))
   sage: %timeit p.map_coefficients(lambda z: int(z)%123)
   100 loops, best of 3: 11 ms per loop
```
With the new commit:

```
sage: R.<x> = SR[]
sage: p = prod(x+i for i in range(60))
sage: %timeit p.map_coefficients(lambda z: int(z)%123)
100 loops, best of 3: 5.21 ms per loop
```

Note that I tested several ways of creating a new polynomial: Using a list or a dict, creating the dict in a loop or with a closure, and calling `R(data)` or `R.element_class(R, data)`. According to these tests, using list and element_class is slightly (but really not much) the fastest way. Most time is spent in calling the lambda function anyway.

In addition, I made map_coefficients cpdef, so that Cython code calling it internally will benefit.

Yes, and it is also a behavior change (and no longer matches its documentation). Compare with sage 8.1.beta2:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: p = x^10 + x^2 + 3
sage: p.map_coefficients(lambda x: x+1)
2*x^10 + 2*x^2 + 4
```
vs this branch

```
2*x^10 + x^9 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 2*x^2 + x + 4
```
This part is simple to change by adding a check for nonzero of the coefficient. However, we need to keep the old version for sparse polynomials.

I guess such check did happen in the past, as the old implementation of `map_coefficients` used `self.dict()`, which does this:

```python
    def dict(self):
        """
        Return a sparse dictionary representation of this univariate
        polynomial.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
            sage: f = x^3 + -1/7*x + 13
            sage: f.dict()
            {0: 13, 1: -1/7, 3: 1}
        """
        X = {}
        Y = self.list(copy=False)
        for i in xrange(len(Y)):
            c = Y[i]
            if c:
                X[i] = c
        return X
```

> However, we need to keep the old version for sparse polynomials.

I see, there is no `list()` method for sparse polynomials.

Okay, changing it from a `cpdef` to a `def` drops the run down to 6.9ms...

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A13):
> Okay, changing it from a `cpdef` to a `def` drops the run down to 6.9ms...

Interesting.

Experimenting with the code, I made a similar experience - the current code seems optimal.

However, I will now try a potential way out for both dense and sparse polynomials: As we have seen, a generic implementation has to use `dict()`, but as we have seen as well, it eats time to create a new dict from an old one by applying the function. Idea: Change `dict(self)` to `dict(self, f=None)`, where if f is not None then it is used to map the coefficients.

Hence, I will try to modify this:

```
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_element.py:    def dict(self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element_generic.py:    def dict(self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/polydict.pyx:    def dict(PolyDict self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/multi_polynomial_libsingular.pyx:    def dict(self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx:    def dict(self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/laurent_polynomial.pyx:    def dict(self):
src/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.pyx:    def dict(self):

I didn't expect that modifying the list (using `.pop()`) is faster than enumerating over the list (only by a small margin, but I repeated the timings and they seem stable).

The new commit is not tested and not sufficiently documented.

What *should* happen:
- In the old code, `map_coefficients` creates `self.dict()` (which is obtained from `self.list()`), creates its `items()`, applies a function to the values, turns the result into a new dict, and creates a polynomial from it.
- In the new code, `self.map_coefficients(f)` creates a polynomial from `self.dict(f)`, which is obtained from `self.list()` by applying `f`. Hence, no intermediate dict and no intermediate item list is involved.

Should the new code thus not be faster? Sadly, it isn't! Can you tell me why?

The following is what *any* implementation of `.map_coefficients()` has to do:
1. Obtain all non-zero coefficients (e.g. via `.dict()`). This involves zero tests.
2. Map the non-zero coefficients.
3. Create a polynomial out of the result of 2.

Meanwhile it seems to me that the above essential tasks take most of the execution time. Hence, the timings of different implementations will differ only very slightly, as there is no way around the above tasks (except caching of 1., which probably is no option).

I wouldn't mind to resolve this ticket as "invalid/won't fix".
