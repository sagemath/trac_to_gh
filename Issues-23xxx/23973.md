For a few weeks now (I haven't been able to pursue the issue much due to travel) I've had to take the Cygwin patchbot down due to an issue that didn't occur before where building the docs, particularly with multiple processes, hangs indefinitely.

For some reason, the problem appears to begin with [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8cb8a4d58dd74922a5b66d6b20f0b3a7507ea611).  Before this commit the docs build no problem.  After this commit it will build several documents and then all the worker processes will just deadlock it seems.

Does this happen after a *failure* or during a *successful* build?

Hard to say, but now that I take a careful look at the doc build log I think there might be an unhandled failure of some sort. I just tried a new build from scratch and here's what I found:  The document `en/constructions`, that was edited in that commit, starts building (again, this is a parallel build so the log is interleaved):

```
[dochtml] Building en/constructions.
[dochtml]
[dochtml] [construct] loading pickled environment... not yet created
[dochtml] [construct] Compiling the master document
[dochtml] [construct] building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date

[dochtml] [construct] updating environment: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 removed
[dochtml] [construct] reading sources... [  6%] algebraic_geometry
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] pickling environment... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] checking consistency... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] preparing documents... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] writing output... [100%] index

[dochtml] [a_tour_of] generating indices... genindex

[dochtml] [a_tour_of] ... done (108 js index entries)

[dochtml] [a_tour_of] copying images... [ 50%] sin_plot.png
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] copying images... [100%] eigen_plot.png
[dochtml] Insufficient memory for black list
```

It's not clear where "Insufficient memory for black list" is coming from but probably `en/constructions`.  After that there's no more output from that worker, but the remaining documents get built successfully, and then the build hangs.

So I guess this is a matter of poor error handling.  Reminds me I should finish my work to generalize `DocTestDispatcher.parallel_dispatch` :)

Here's a full summary of the issue so far, and how the attached patch addresses it:

* Cygwin processes reserve an address space for Cygwin's "private heap" for the process--most POSIX system calls that manipulate the heap (e.g. `brk`, `sbrk`) are manipulating Cygwin's heap.
  * This private heap is of a fixed size and reserved at process startup--this allows it to be used freely without interference from Windows, which may be doing whatever it wants with the rest of the process's virtual address space.
  * Most of the time this is not a problem--while Cygwin's `malloc` does make small allocations to the heap, larger allocations are made with `mmap` and can be anywhere in the Windows process's VM space (not within the private heap).
  * However, a custom memory allocator (such as that used by libgc) may still run into problems here. In particular, the default configuration for libgc on Cygwin is to use `sbrk` *only* for memory allocations.  
  * It *just happened* that running the doc build in the manner I was running it deterministically (but otherwise arbitrarily) caused ``sbrk`` to bump into the fixed size limit of the private heap (at least I think--I have not directly confirmed this but it seems likely).  This was happening to me in the context of the doc build, but in principle this error could have come up in some other context.

 For a few weeks now (I haven't been able to pursue the issue much due to travel) I've had to take the Cygwin patchbot down due to an issue that didn't occur before where building the docs, particularly with multiple processes, hangs indefinitely.
 
 For some reason, the problem appears to begin with [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8cb8a4d58dd74922a5b66d6b20f0b3a7507ea611).
