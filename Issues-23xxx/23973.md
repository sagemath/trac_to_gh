For a few weeks now (I haven't been able to pursue the issue much due to travel) I've had to take the Cygwin patchbot down due to an issue that didn't occur before where building the docs, particularly with multiple processes, hangs indefinitely.

For some reason, the problem appears to begin with [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/commit/8cb8a4d58dd74922a5b66d6b20f0b3a7507ea611).  Before this commit the docs build no problem.  After this commit it will build several documents and then all the worker processes will just deadlock it seems.

Hard to say, but now that I take a careful look at the doc build log I think there might be an unhandled failure of some sort. I just tried a new build from scratch and here's what I found:  The document `en/constructions`, that was edited in that commit, starts building (again, this is a parallel build so the log is interleaved):

```
[dochtml] Building en/constructions.
[dochtml]
[dochtml] [construct] loading pickled environment... not yet created
[dochtml] [construct] Compiling the master document
[dochtml] [construct] building [mo]: targets for 0 po files that are out of date

[dochtml] [a_tour_of] pickling environment... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] checking consistency... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] preparing documents... done
[dochtml] [a_tour_of] writing output... [100%] index

[dochtml] [a_tour_of] copying images... [100%] eigen_plot.png
[dochtml] Insufficient memory for black list
```

It's not clear where "Insufficient memory for black list" is coming from but probably `en/constructions`.  After that there's no more output from that worker, but the remaining documents get built successfully, and then the build hangs.

So I guess this is a matter of poor error handling.  Reminds me I should finish my work to generalize `DocTestDispatcher.parallel_dispatch` :)

I take it back. Looking at the error message it gave it actually couldn't have been using gc 7.6.  In fact for some reason when I upgraded gc it did not replace the old DLL.

I got gc 7.6 installed correctly this time, but unfortunately it still did not resolve the problem.  The error message output during the build of this document is now slightly more helpful but not by much:

```
GC Warning: Out of memory - trying to allocate requested amount (8224 bytes)...
Insufficient memory for black list
