#22493 has caused a significant regression for `padic_base_leaves.py` (this was discovered while investigating #23284, it is not necessarily limited to that file).

Before #22493: `[142 tests, 178.75 s]`

After #22493 and #23209: `[142 tests, 181.61 s]`

(in both cases, this was a best-out-of-10 timing but the variance is small enough that this is statistically very significant)

Depends on #32549

Maybe we can accept a 10% performance regression, but certainly not without further investigation. The problem may be much worse than it appears to be on the surface.
