The polymake experimental package does not compile with `gcc (GCC) 7.1.1` (see [attachment: polymake-3.1.log](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23289/polymake-3.1.log)). In this [thread on polymake forum](https://forum.polymake.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=559) upstream reports the same issue. We adapt a very simple patch proposed in the thread.
