split off from #23787

refactoring of the comparison of ideals in multivariate polynomials

* to get rid of cmp
* consistent comparison by containment
* when a total order is needed, compare instead by gens

This should be ready to go. This refactors the comparison of ideals in multi-variate polynomial rings. Comparison is now meaning "for containment" in all cases.

Besides, it tries to avoid computing Grobner bases, by first comparing the generators.

Please review.

Rather than comparing gens as a list, I would compare them as sets. That way, reordering of gens doesn't require a GB computation, e.g.:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = ZZ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x^2, x*y - y^2 + 2])
sage: Ip = R.ideal([x*y - y^2 + 2, x^2])
sage: I.gens()
[x^2, x*y - y^2 + 2]
sage: Ip.gens()
[x*y - y^2 + 2, x^2]
sage: I == Ip   # Avoid GB here
True
```

Also, what is the rationale for this change:

```diff

* I have modifed the comparison to use sets of gens.

* The changes in scheme_morphisms and dynamical systems could probably be made independently now, even if at some point they were intertwined with the main issue here.

* the precise change you talk about was made so that one could replace comparison of domains (in dynamical systems) with a call to is_endomorphism.
