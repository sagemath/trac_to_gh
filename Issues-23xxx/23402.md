Hashing of nf element go through `self.polynomial()` which is damn slow!

The attached branch provides a quick hash version (that is more robust than the one for polynomial). A x10 speed up is seen on the following example (425 ms vs 40ms)

```
sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
sage: l = [i * b + j * b^2 for i in range(100) for j in range(100)]
sage: l.sort()
sage: %time s = set(l[i+1] - l[i] for i in range(len(l)-1))
```

<a id='comment:4'></a>These "magic numbers" are just used to randomize the bits and can be obtained via

```
sage: phi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
sage: hex(int(2^32 / phi))
'0x9e3779b9'
sage: int(phi * 2^62)
7461864723258187525
```
The `7461864723258187525` was not chosen by me but comes from the hash value of rationals...

I can actually be more coherent and use the same value in both places.

+Hashing of nf element go through `self.polynomial()` which is damn slow!
 
+The attached branch provides a quick hash version (that is more robust than the one for polynomial). A x10 speed up is seen on the following example (425 ms vs 40ms)
+
+```
+sage: K.<b> = NumberField(x^3 - 2)
+sage: l = [i * b + j * b^2 for i in range(100) for j in range(100)]
+sage: l.sort()
