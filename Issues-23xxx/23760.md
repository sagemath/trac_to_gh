Is there a way to add tests for this, and/or can you tell me what I should look for to see if this change was successful?

There are also a few pre-existing issues with backticks (missing around True and False, mismatched with one on the left of an expression and two on the other...)

ok. Thanks for having a look.

Well, I have added a test that checks that the resulting tree is endowed with *some* embedding.

To see if this embedding is the correct one, you can look at the plot of the tree (which uses the embedding) and compare with the expected answer. Not obvious to me how to do this easily. You need to draw the tesselation, find the pieces and draw the dual graph.

I have also modified the docs and the doctests for better and nicer look.
