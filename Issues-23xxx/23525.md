Currently, this does not work

```
sage: R.<a> = ZqFM(9)
sage: a.is_squarefree()

Maybe we should just raise a `TypeError` for fields?  `QQ` and number fields don't define an `is_squarefree` method (though elements of orders don't either).  This may be another case where we can return a technically correct answer but it's most likely not what the user was expecting.
