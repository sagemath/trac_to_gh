Maybe we should just raise a `TypeError` for fields?  `QQ` and number fields don't define an `is_squarefree` method (though elements of orders don't either).  This may be another case where we can return a technically correct answer but it's most likely not what the user was expecting.

It means that you can write algorithms without checking for trivial cases. E.g., we do this already to determine whether a polynomial is squarefree: first we check whether it's content is squarefree. A trivial check over fields, but still the correct thing to do.

PS: I think it really depends on who are you writing code for. Beginners will be surprised that

```
sage: x = 8/2; x
4
sage: x.is_squarefree()
True
```
but eventually you are going to learn that parents are very important in Sage…
