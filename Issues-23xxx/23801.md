The problem is in

```
elif hasattr(self, '_prefix'):
    K = GF(p**degree, name=name, prefix=self._prefix)
    return [(K, self.coerce_map_from(K))]
```
Prefix is only used when name is `None`.  So it creates a new finite field instead of just using the trivial embedding of the field into itself.  In the examples you gave, the problem only occurs in the degree 93/16 embedding respectively (though for larger fields, I would expect the problem to arise in other degrees as well).

We can probably replace the definition of `K` with `K = self.algebraic_closure()._subfield(degree)`, but that needs to be checked.

I think that creating a field with a name different from its prefix is weird, but we may want to support it as a way for the user to name the generator for a particular field but have it fit into a particular algebraic closure.

I think that there should be no coercion from K2 to K.
