Current Cython accepts code like

```
cimport sage.structure.category_object
 
cdef class Parent(category_object.CategoryObject):
    ...
```

This is wrong but Cython accepts it by mistake. In Cython master, this becomes error.

The attached branch fixes some of these. While working on this ticket, I ran into some more serious problems with Cython master, in particular https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1739

So this branch is simply how far I got. But the changes make sense individually, so these can be fixed now even if not all issues are fixed.
