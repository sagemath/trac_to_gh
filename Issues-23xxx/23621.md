The quotient of `ZZ[x]` by the ideal `(x, 2)`
works fine using a multivariate polynomial ring:

```
sage: R.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ, 1)
sage: I = R.ideal([x, 2])
sage: I
Ideal (x, 2) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: S = R.quo(I)
sage: [[S(a) == S(b) for b in (0, 2, x)] for a in (0, 2, x)]
[[True, True, True], [True, True, True], [True, True, True]]
```
but it fails using a univariate polynomial ring,
returning mathematically wrong answers:

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: I = R.ideal([x, 2])
sage: I
Ideal (x, 2) of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
sage: S = R.quo(I)
sage: 
sage: [[S(a) == S(b) for b in (0, 2, x)] for a in (0, 2, x)]
[[True, False, False], [False, True, False], [False, False, True]]
```
Expected:

```
[[True, True, True], [True, True, True], [True, True, True]]
```

```
The only requirement is that the two-sided ideal `I`
provides a ``reduce`` method so that ``I.reduce(x)`` is the normal
form of an element `x` with respect to `I` (i.e., we have
``I.reduce(x) == I.reduce(y)`` if `x-y \in I`, and
``x - I.reduce(x) in I``). H
```
And I think that this is a logic requirement to put on the reduce method.
