```
Comments for Trac:23139

graphicmatroid.py
=================

l.22 include a "regular_matroid" method that returns the RegularMatroid
associated with M(G). Use this in the Matroid constructor function too.
Do this on a new ticket.

l.82 remove Stefan van Zwam

l.108 include OUTPUT block.

l.108ish include documentation explaining the treatment of disconnected
graphs (maybe as ..NOTE:: or ..WARNING:: block?). Change the examples
block as follows (example stolen from the __init__ method)

 EXAMPLES::

 sage: from sage.matroids.advanced import *
 sage: M = GraphicMatroid(graphs.BullGraph()); M
 Graphic matroid of rank 4 on 5 elements
 sage: N = GraphicMatroid(graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,3)); N
 Graphic matroid of rank 5 on 9 elements

 A disconnected input will get converted to a connected graph internally::

 sage: G1 = graphs.CycleGraph(3); G2 = graphs.DiamondGraph()
 sage: G = G1.disjoint_union(G2) 
 sage: len(G) 
 7
 sage: G.is_connected()
 False
 sage: M = GraphicMatroid(G)
 sage: M
 Graphic matroid of rank 5 on 8 elements
 sage: H = M.graph()
 sage: H
 Looped multi-graph on 6 vertices
 sage: H.is_connected()
 True
 sage: M.is_connected()
 False

 You can still locate an edge using the vertices of the input graph::

 sage: G1 = graphs.CycleGraph(3); G2 = graphs.DiamondGraph()
 sage: G = G1.disjoint_union(G2)
 sage: M = Matroid(G)
 sage: H = M.graph()
 sage: vm = M.vertex_map()
 sage: (u, v, l) = G.random_edge()
 sage: H.has_edge(vm[u], vm[v])
 True

l. 343 We made a choice for testing equality: the underlying graphs need
to be the same. Document this here, with plenty of examples of things
that either do or do not compare as equal! Include: isomorphic graphs,
same edge labels, different vertex labels; disconnected matroids with
different graph presentations; etc.

 A more subtle example where the vertex labels differ::

 sage: G1 = Graph([(0,1,0),(0,2,1),(1,2,2)])
 sage: G2 = Graph([(3,4,3),(3,5,4),(4,5,5),(4,6,6),(5,6,7)])
 sage: G = G1.disjoint_union(G2)
 sage: H = G2.disjoint_union(G1)
 sage: Matroid(G) == Matroid(H)
 False
 sage: Matroid(G).equals(Matroid(H))
 True

l. 499 Include examples where N is not 3-connected.

l. 533 space missing

l. 733 slightly more efficient (only one "set" data structure gets
created):

 vertices = set([u for (u, v, l) in edges]) vertices.union_update([v for (u, v, l) in edges])

l. 793 subset of ``X``

l. 830 This check slows things down unnecessarily. Instead, add an
"else" statement to the for loop of l. 838 (if the loop finishes
normally, i.e. the set was a forest, the else statement will be executed)

l. 966, 1001 and numerous other places: when using keyword arguments,
don't put spaces around = see
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations

l. 1015 instead of reverting to abstract matroid isomorphism, maybe try
to convert to a RegularMatroid instead? The same would be wise if N is a
GraphicMatroid but 3-connectivity fails (then convert both to
RegularMatroid instances simultaneously).

l. 1054: this should probably be the only line of code for this method.
Reverting to the abstract Matroid class is worse than just always
carrying out this command, imho.

l. 1178: This can be a one-liner:

 return [(self._groundset_edge_map[x][0], self._groundset_edge_map[x][1], x) for x in X]

l. 1233 spaces again

l. 1234 Documentation needs improvement. You need to mention explicitly
the behavior when the vertex label is new. And when both labels are new,
the new graph will do one of its automatic merges, which should be
documented. Example:

 sage: M = Matroid(graphs.PetersenGraph())
 sage: M.graphic_extension('a', 'b', 'c').graph().vertices()
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'b']

Note no vertex 'a' exists. One way to reduce user error going
undetected, would be to require that 'u' is a vertex of the current
graph.

l. 1266 This comment is wrong l. 1275 same

l. 1282 add an option "simple=False". If true, no parallel edges are
added.

l. 1285 add a paragraph explaining this function. Specifically, mention
that it does not take 2-isomorphism into account, and only extends the
current graph representation.

l. 1325 the argument to "issubset" does not need to be a set, can just
be an iterable.

l. 1344 instead of this, research and use the "yield" command.

l. 1348 explain what happens if X is None.

l. 1360 coextended

l. 1429 I don't trust this line. e.g.:

sage: M = Matroid(Graph())
sage: N = M.graphic_coextension(0)
sage: N
Graphic matroid of rank 0 on 1 elements

That's not what you meant, right?

l. 1433 maybe have an optional argument for the new vertex label?

l. 1435 no need for named vertices

l. 1440 maybe another argument cosimple=False? If set to True, only do
the vertex splits that have >= two edges on each side.

l. 1442 Again, write more documentation about what this does, and how it
handles low connectivity.

l. 1456 Thinking about this, there are only two logical design choices
that I can see. Either the method returns "every vertex split in every
possible way", or it returns "one extension by a coloop, one copy of
each coextension by a series element, and otherwise simple
coextensions." I'm inclined to prefer the latter: it seems to mimic the
behavior of the graphic_extensions method better, and fits the typical
use case of generating all non-isomorphic matroids up to a certain size.
Whichever choice you make, go all the way. Right now, the method does
something in-between (in l. 1537, if both u and v are in "vertices",
only one copy of the new edge will be created, attached to the latter).

Also: document clearly what the method does!

l. 1522 see l. 1325

l. 1528 again, use "yield" for more efficient code (in terms of memory
consumption). Especially important in the cographic case.

l. 1531 again, perhaps add an optional argument for the new vertex label?

l. 1537 if (u, v, l) is such an edge then the new edge will be attached
to v. But we want to attach it to u if u is in the set "vertices" but v
is not.

l. 1550 this bit can be cleaner. Start with l. 1555: just pick an
element that will always be part of "g". Then iterate over all
partitions of the rest.

l. 1652 no "set" needed in argument for union

l. 1659 can use "pop()" here

l. 1800 no need for named arguments

utilities.py:
=============

l. 728 spaces

l. 739, 741 inconsistent capitalization

linear_matroid.pyx
==================

l. 504 as long as you're editing this line anyway, change "it's" to "its"

constructor.py
==============

Here, too, you should include an example that illustrate what happens to
disconnected graphs. You can reuse the one from above.

```
graphic_matroid.py
==================
l.116 ``instance'' should be singular
l.382 ``must'' -> ``to be''
l.531,564 missing OUTPUT blocks (check elsewhere too, please)
l.1095 space
l.1312 documentation does not match examples and behavior (``u`` can't be a new vertex)
l.1349 add test showing the addition of a coloop to the empty graph.

sage: M = Matroid(Graph())
sage: M.graphic_extension(0,1,'a')
Graphic matroid of rank 1 on 1 elements

l.1561 It makes more sense to modify this method so that ``u`` is always a vertex of the graph, just as in graphic_extension
l.1699 If is_cosimple=True, the empty graphic matroid should not have any coextensions.


DOCTESTS:
=========

avoid printing frozensets, as the order is not guaranteed to remain constant (it's a set after all).
I had the following failures:

If so, that means this changes is backwards incompatible as the doctests indicate. Actually, perhaps to avoid backwards-incompatible changes, it is better for *un*labeled graphs with no multiple edges to have an ground set be the edge pairs.

Actually, I am not sure I understand why this change is needed as the groundset is `range(len(G.edges()))`:

Also, the doctest failure

```
AttributeError: 'GraphicMatroid' object has no attribute 'groundset_list'
```
indicates that there is an inconsistency with other types of matroids.

Some other quick comments/questions:

- Remove "SageMath" from the doc, especially where it is being used as an adjective.
- Your `INPUT:` blocks should be of the form:
  {{{
- ``var_name`` -- some short description with no capitalization or period
  }}}
  Even if this is done is other matroid files, IMO it is good to try and follow Sage's documentation conventions.
- For comments:
  {{{
if foo:
    # It is easier to read and understand if the comments
    # are at the next level
  }}}
- For PEP8, use, e.g., `Matroid(G, regular=True)`, not `Matroid(G, regular = True)`.
- In `_coclosure`, you need a blankline after `INPUT`.
- I hate tables of methods, so IMO, it should be killed with fire and holy water. Everything you need is included below, and they are a pain to maintain (because you have to do it manually). However, that is my personal opinion, and I won't say you need to remove it. Yet, what you are referencing are methods, not functions, so use `:meth:` instead of `:func:`.
- `RegularMatroid` is not a module, but a class. So
  {{{#!diff
-:mod:`RegularMatroid <sage.matroids.linear_matroid.RegularMatroid>`
+:class:`~sage.matroids.linear_matroid.RegularMatroid`
  }}}
- The leading tilde `~` just has the last object displayed in the doc, so you can do
  {{{#!diff
-:meth:`regular_matroid <sage.matroids.graphic_matroids.GraphicMatroid.regular_matroid>`
+:meth:`~sage.matroids.graphic_matroids.GraphicMatroid.regular_matroid`
  }}}
- I think it would be good to add a `TestSuite(M).run()` in the `GraphicMatroid.__init__` method on some graphic matroid `M`.

Yes, but in two different ways. Some tests fail because the ground set labels are different, and some tests fail because it wants a `BasisExchangeMatroid` and gets a `GraphicMatroid`.

As I understand it, when the constructor takes a graph to make a `RegularMatroid`, it will use vertex tuples as ground set labels unless there are multiedges, where it will use integers instead. I think this is the right behavior for representing a graph with a matrix, since we lose the context of the graph, but I think it's unnecessary when we still have the graph attached to the matroid.

The method `groundset_list()` belongs to `BasisExchangeMatroid`, which is a superclass of `RegularMatroid`. It looks like other matroid classes don't have it, and it doesn't seem like it would translate easily since only `BasisExchangeMatroid`s have the attribute `_E`. When orlik-solomon.py was written, they were probably expecting a regular matroid, which is why I changed the test to give it one.

That particular change probably wasn't needed. I just went through and changed them all to be regular matroids.

I'll look into the other documentation and spacing conventions, and make changes soon.

My point about backwards incompatibility is still valid, as well as my recommendation about the groundset for *un*labeled (simple) graphs to try and alleviate the problem. You do loose the association between the groundset and the graph by not using the edges as the groundset for *un*labeled graphs. So I do not completely agree with your point.

Well, it's not explicitly used within the code of the Orlik-Solomon algebras, but only for this method. If it is something only for `RegualrMatroid`, then we can just change the input to sort the groundset, which would be in line with what the OS code does.

> Not too sure what to do to fix the input blocks. The documentation I could find on the conventions http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#documentation-strings indicates that they're short with no capitalization at the beginning or punctuation at the end, unless they're long and verbose.


For example:

```diff
-        - `X` -- an object with Python's ``frozenset`` interface.
+        - ``X`` -- an object with Python's ``frozenset`` interface
```

```diff
-        - ``other`` -- A matroid.
+        - ``other`` -- a matroid
```

```diff
-        - ``contractions`` -- frozenset, subset of ``self.groundset()`` to be contracted
-        -  ``deletions`` -- frozenset, subset of ``self.groundset()`` to be deleted
+        - ``contractions`` -- frozenset; subset of ``self.groundset()`` to be contracted
+        - ``deletions`` -- frozenset; subset of ``self.groundset()`` to be deleted
```

```diff
-        - ``N`` - A matroid.
-        - ``certificate`` - (default: ``False``) If ``True``, returns
-          either ``False, None`` or
-          ``True, (X, Y, dic) where ``N`` is isomorphic to ``self.minor(X, Y)``,
-          and ``dic`` is an isomorphism between ``N`` and ``self.minor(X, Y)``.
+        - ``N`` -- a matroid
+        - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) if ``True``, returns the certificate
+          isomorphism from the minor of ``self`` to ``N``
```
(The data on the certificate should be in the `OUTPUT` block.)

```diff
-        - ``X`` -- An object with Python's ``frozenset`` interface containing
-          a subset of ``self.groundset()``.
+        - ``X`` -- an object with Python's ``frozenset`` interface containing
+          a subset of ``self.groundset()``
```
There are others. Also, remove the `INPUT:` when there is no (non-`self`) input.

<a id='comment:76'></a>Travis, regarding backwards compatibility: would you be happy with the following compromise?

CHANGE:

* `Matroid(G)` returns `GraphicMatroid` instead of `RegularMatroid`
* `matroids.CompleteGraphic()` returns `GraphicMatroid` instead of `RegularMatroid`
* same for `matroids.Wheel()` if no field is given, `matroids.named_matroids.Terrahawk()`

STAY THE SAME:

* default groundset generator for the `Matroid()` constructor function on input of a graph
* groundsets for the special matroids mentioned above.

EDIT: this way, the identity function on the groundset is an isomorphism, but the different classes don't overlap completely in their methods.

That was precisely what I was proposing (although I may have done so horribly). So, sorry, that is not much of a compromise. :P (Edit: I am saying I agree to this completely.)

IMO, having the groundset being the edges is a little more clear.

> EDIT: this way, the identity function on the groundset is an isomorphism, but the different classes don't overlap completely in their methods.


That is okay for now. We can fix things as we go along as we find the methods that are missing. I just pointed out `groundset_list` because it became relevant via the doctest (but I agree that it does not make sense beyond the `RegularMatroid` class).
