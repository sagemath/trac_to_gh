Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions!

I have made the corresponding corrections.
I have also added more material to the Introduction with a complete small (minimal ?) example.
I have not showed the matrices in this example though. 
I think it is better to leave this to the doctest of the functions dedicated to the linear algebra part of F5.

* in this line of the reference file:

```

```
you need to add a \ (for obscure technical reasons..) as follows

```

```

* when citing a reference, there must be an underscore after the brackets, for example 

```
+We have followed [Fau02]_, [AP11]_, [EF17]_ and [VY17]_.
```

* The following

```
