<a id='comment:11'></a>Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions!

I have made the corresponding corrections.
I have also added more material to the Introduction with a complete small (minimal ?) example.
I have not showed the matrices in this example though. 
I think it is better to leave this to the doctest of the functions dedicated to the linear algebra part of F5.

<a id='comment:12'></a>* in this line of the reference file:

```
+.. [VY2017] T. Vaccon, K.Yokoyama, *A Tropical F5 Algorithm*, 
```
you need to add a \ (for obscure technical reasons..) as follows

```
+.. [VY2017] \T. Vaccon, K.Yokoyama, *A Tropical F5 Algorithm*, 
```

* when citing a reference, there must be an underscore after the brackets, for example 

```
+We have followed [Fau02]_, [AP11]_, [EF17]_ and [VY17]_.
```

* The following

```
+REFERENCES:
+
+.. [F02] Jean-Charles Faugère. *A new efficient algorithm for computing Gröbner bases without reduction to zero (F5)*.  In Proceedings of the 2002 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation, ISSAC '02, pages 75-83, New York, NY, USA, 2002. ACM.
