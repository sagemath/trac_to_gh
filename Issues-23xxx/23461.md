Thank you very much for your comments and suggestions!

I have made the corresponding corrections.
I have also added more material to the Introduction with a complete small (minimal ?) example.
I have not showed the matrices in this example though. 
I think it is better to leave this to the doctest of the functions dedicated to the linear algebra part of F5.
