```
sage: D4 = QuadraticForm(Matrix(ZZ,4,4,[2,0,0,-1,0,2,0,-1,0,0,2,-1,-1,-1,-1,2]))
sage: G = D4.global_genus_symbol()
sage: sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.is_GlobalGenus(G)
True
sage: G == copy(G)
True
sage: sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.is_GlobalGenus(G)
False
```

The reason is that various functions unintentionally modify their input. Since a genus consists of lists containing lists, functions do just copy the lists but not deepcopy.

For example sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.canonical_2_adic_reduction modifies its input which does not seem to be intended.

Keywords: **sd87, Genus, sd91**
