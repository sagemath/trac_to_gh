The following is wrong

```
sage: g1 = Graph(weighted=True)
sage: g2 = Graph(weighted=True)
sage: g = g1.union(g2)
sage: g.weighted()
False
```

For both loops and multiedges the union takes an "or" (ie `g` allows loops if any of `g1` or `g2` allows loops). Though it is not clear that such rule should apply for weighted. Three possibilities
- make `g` weighted if any of `g1` or `g2` are
- make `g` weighted if both `g1` and `g2` are
- When `g1.weighted()` and `g2.weighted()` are different raise a `ValueError` and otherwise apply any of the two above rules.

I don't use weighted graph very often, so I don't know what is expected: number as label? dictionary with specific key? If we make the union weigthed if one of the graph is weighted, should we turn `None` to 0 ? what if one of the graph has `"bob"` for label ? should we check that weights are consistent ?

The easiest is certainly to raise an error.
