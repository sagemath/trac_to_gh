`_richcmp_` (and the former `_cmp_`) can be used only for Element classes, and will be used by the coercion framework.

On the other hand, if often makes no sense to define a total order on a set of parents. That's why `__cmp__` is replaced by just `__eq__` and `__ne__`.

**EDIT** When comparison is really wanted for parents, one soon will be able to use `__richcmp__`, which is for the moment restricted to .pyx files.

Well, I would see at least two reasons for using `_richcmp_`, namely

# this is easy to use, as a quick replacement for `__cmp__` or `_cmp_`

Given the quantity of work remaining to be done on cmp, this is a big plus.

# it uses coercion

this allows in particular to remove all checks of the kind "do they have the same parent"
