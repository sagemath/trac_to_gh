It would be nice if the following worked:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(["A", 2], shape=[2,1])
sage: x = list(C)[0]
sage: x.to_tableau().shape()
[2, 1]
sage: x.shape() # boom! no attribute 'shape'
[2, 1]
```

Thanks for implementing this! Some crystals have spins and behave a little differently from the usual. For those one gets an error message:

```
One option might be to get the shape from the parent:

```
sage: C = crystals.Tableaux(['B',2],shape=[1/2,1/2])
sage: C.shapes
((1/2, 1/2),)
```
Alternatively, one needs to treat the spin cases separately.
