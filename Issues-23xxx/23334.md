    "body": "<a id='comment:10'></a>\nA took a first look and here are a few initial comments:\n\n- also change the description of the algorithm in canonical_height in projective_morphism\n\n- move reference to reference file and add citations here\n\n- 1031: line too long\n\n- a bunch of your earlier work is to get integer coefficients and coordinates. I'd recommend using the built in functions instead\n  - f.normalize_coordinates() - removes gcd and clears denominators\n  - Q.normalize_coordinates() - removes gcd\n  - Q.clear_denominators() - clears denominators\n\n- 'not err == None'  should be  'not err is None'\n\n- Height_I - lower case\n\n- you do a lot of extraneous variable assignment for example\n  - P = self\n  - f = F\n  - A_0, B_0\n\nyou don't need all these extra variables floating around\n\n- and something not minor: The error bound calculation seems to be failing.

A took a first look and here are a few initial comments:

- also change the description of the algorithm in canonical_height in projective_morphism

- move reference to reference file and add citations here

- 1031: line too long

- a bunch of your earlier work is to get integer coefficients and coordinates. I'd recommend using the built in functions instead
  - f.normalize_coordinates() - removes gcd and clears denominators
  - Q.normalize_coordinates() - removes gcd
  - Q.clear_denominators() - clears denominators

- 'not err == None'  should be  'not err is None'

- Height_I - lower case

- you do a lot of extraneous variable assignment for example
  - P = self
  - f = F
  - A_0, B_0

you don't need all these extra variables floating around

- and something not minor: The error bound calculation seems to be failing. I put in Wells example 4.4 as a test (which I recommend you do as well) and got the appropriate value when assigning N but not when assigning err.

```

The functionality works fine in tests and the notebook. However, I have a couple minor suggestions and a part I don't understand why it works.

- add citation to projective morphism canonical_height

- shouldn't this part go under ALGORITHM?

```
If function is defined over ``QQ`` uses Wells Algorithm, which allows us to
        not have to factor the resultant.
```

- Does this line really need .abs()?

```
1154: H = H + R(g).abs().log()/(d**(n+1))
```

- line 1145 Res.abs() is better than abs(Res)


- Note sure if it is better, but couldn't you do

```
N = ceil(R(abs(Res)).log().log(d) - R(d-1).log(d) - R(err).log(d))
```


- lines 1157-8: you really seem to be computing

```
h = self.green_function(F, 0 , **kwds) - H + R(t).log()
```
I'm also slightly confused by why this is right. Doesn't Wells' paper (proposition 2.3) have

```
h = self.global_height() - self.green_function(F,0) - H
```
I assume that R(t).log() is the correction for the function coordinate normalization.

The reason our formula looks a bit different is due to the difference between what Wells calls H_infty and what greens function actually returns for the infinite place. 

Left * N = ceil(R(abs(Res)).log().log(d) - R(d-1).log(d) - R(err).log(d)) as is because that way it will look more like Well's Algorithm.

You should still condense those two lines down to one (1157-8) and perhaps you should add a comment about the difference in notation.

doc still does not build :

```
sage.schemes.projective.projective_point.SchemeMorphism_point_projective_ring.canonical_height:79: WARNING: Literal block expected; none found.
```
probably because of the RSA768 line

Note that in the same function, you should not indent the content of the ALGORITHM section.

**EDIT**:

Something else: in the reference file, the link to arxiv should be written

Several typos here:

```
Looks diffrent than Well's Algorithm because of the diffrence
...
for the infite place
```

Also `range(0, N)` should be `range(N)`

This

```
+            h = self.green_function(F, 0 , **kwds) - H + R(t).log()
+            return h
```
can be made in one line (no need to store h)
