As the discussion in #23185 shows, this is very confusing, even in trivial cases. We should provide examples for common cases that people can then essentially copy & paste from.

Just to start.  An example from the code that I am now looking at:

```
def _richcmp__(self, other, op):
    """
    Compare this ideal with the other ideal with respect to ``op``.
    ...
    """
    if self.ring() != other.ring():
        raise ValueError("rings must be the same")

    return richcmp(self.module(), other.module(), op)  
```

Feel free to suggest a better idiom.

Seriously `_richcmp__`? Is that a typo or is that the actual name?

That is a typo. It should be `_richcmp_`. Sorry.

OK, so let me comment. It is important to know that `_richcmp_` guarantees (through the coercion model) that both arguments have the same parent. For ideals, I would guess that this implies that the rings are the same. In that case, the check

```
if self.ring() != other.ring():

```

Then the example is simply

    return richcmp(self.module(), other.module(), op) 
```

I think this is typical case indeed.

I wonder what happens (or should happen) when the parents are different after attempting coercion. I remember this is a controversial issue though...
