Hello,

When creating an elliptic curve over a finite field the attribute _genus is not initialized.

eg:

```
E = EllipticCurve(GF(3), [0, -1, 0, -346, 2652])
E.genus()
...
AttributeError: 'EllipticCurve_finite_field_with_category' object has no attribute '_genus'
```


Cheers,
Edgar

I believe we just need to set  `self._genus = 1`  when constructing the elliptic curve.

I agree this is a trivial function, but there are methods inherited from hyperelliptic curves over finite fields that use the self.genus() call, for example, `self.frobenius_polynomial_matrix()`
