At #20913 pip was patched so that it works without ssl support, and this patch was also submitted upstream. Upstream has since merged the patch at ​https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1165 into 9.0.1. So it makes sense to upgrade pip to this new version in order to have an unpatched pip in sage.

Builds fine and passes tests for me on OS X. Note that on this machine, the `python2` log says that ssl is not built:

```
Python build finished, but the necessary bits to build these modules were not found:
_bsddb             _ssl               dl              
gdbm               imageop            linuxaudiodev   
ossaudiodev        spwd               sunaudiodev     
```
and `import ssl` raises an `ImportError`. So it's good that this new `pip` works.

Hi Chapoton,

I would find it weird if this really did break the python3 build. The error message you posted is one that one would get if the installed pip is not actually 9.0.1:

For example on my machine with sage before this was merged

```
Maartens-MacBook-Pro:sagedev mderickx$ sage -pip -V
pip 8.1.2 from /Applications/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
Maartens-MacBook-Pro:sagedev mderickx$ sage -pip list --format json

Usage:   
  pip list [options]

no such option: --format
```

and after it is merged

```
Maartens-MacBook-Pro:sagedev mderickx$ ./sage -pip -V
pip 9.0.1 from /Applications/sagedev/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
Maartens-MacBook-Pro:sagedev mderickx$ ./sage -pip list --format json
[{"version": "0.7.8", "name": "alabaster"}, ..., {"version": "4.2.0", "name": "zope.interface"}]
```

Could you give me the output of `sage -pip -V` and `ls $SAGE_ROOT/upstream | grep pip`?

so maybe this is a matter of pip versus pip3 ?

Weird, then the only possibility is that sage is picking up some pip from outside its installation.

Could you add the lines

```
proc = subprocess.Popen(["pip", "-V"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout = str(proc.communicate()[0])
print(stdout)
```
before the lines:

```
proc = subprocess.Popen(["pip", "list", "--no-index", "--format", "json"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
     stdout = str(proc.communicate()[0])
```
in `src/sage/misc/package.py` in order to see which pip is being picked up at the point where the build fails?

Alternatively could you describe how to reproduce this error so I can look at it myself?
