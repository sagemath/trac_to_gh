See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/cubegroup.html#sage.groups.perm_gps.cubegroup.CubeGroup.solve
There is something weird at the end of that description which should just be an example.

Even this doesn't work straight up.

```
rubik = CubeGroup()
G = rubik.group() 
g = G("(3,38,43,19)(5,36,45,21)(8,33,48,24)(25,27,32,30)(26,29,31,28)")
g.word_problem([b,d,f,l,r,u])
```
