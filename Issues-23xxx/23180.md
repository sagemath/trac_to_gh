```
mv upstream/gap3-jm01may17.tar.gz gap3-01may17.tar.gz

(it should be `jm01may17` instead of `01may17` in `package-version.txt`).
Then the checksum did not match the tarball in the link in the description, so I had to update that. Next problem is that I can no longer create a complex reflection group:

```
