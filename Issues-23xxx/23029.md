Building Sage 8.0.beta7 on Cygwin fails with:

```
[sagelib-8.0.beta7] In file included from

[sagelib-8.0.beta7]                  from
build/cythonized/sage/libs/linbox/linbox_flint_interface.cpp:572:

```

This is similar to a problem that's come up before in [fflas-ffpack](https://github.com/linbox-team/fflas-ffpack/issues/57), where `B0` is a macro defined in `termios.h`.  This header is not explicitly included anywhere, but but it happens to be included indirectly in some cases on Cygwin.
