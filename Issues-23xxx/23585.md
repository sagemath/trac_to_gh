In the finite field construction, there is no need to give a name for the generator.

It would be useful to be able to choose the ring `QQbar`, `UCF`, `ComplexField(n)`, ... In order to make it work you just have to replace the two calls to `gen` into calls to `zeta`

```
sage: CC.zeta(5)
0.309016994374947 + 0.951056516295154*I
sage: UniversalCyclotomicField().zeta(5)
E(5)
sage: QQbar.zeta(5)
0.3090169943749474? + 0.9510565162951536?*I
```

On a related note, I think that it would be good to have a common entry point for boths Gauss sums (the p-adic one and the one in this ticket)? What about something along

```
def gauss_sum(a, p, f, ring=None, **extra_kwds):
    if ring is None:
        ring = UniversalCyclotomicField()
    ...
```
In that case, I would actually rename the p-adic `gauss_sum` into `padic_gauss_sum`.

Concerning point 3, the new implementation can be obtained from the DirichletGroup one if and only if the finite field has cardinality a prime number. Outside of prime numbers the Dirichlet group implementation returns something else (which is probably of no interest, in fact).

Concerning point 2, I can add doctests, indeed.

Concerning point 1, the choice of multiplicative generator is explained in the doc.

This is not helpful at all. If I have a multiplicative character, with your new function I would have to make a logarithm in order to get my Gauss sum...

I have made so that the character is now an input, given by its value on the multiplicative generator of the group of invertible elements.

I am not going to remove the method from `DirichletGroup`. It may be used by somebody.

I would rather not go to full generality, as long as it has no specific and concrete use. The new function, in its current form, is needed for #23671.

I am sorry to bother you so much Frédéric. You are introducing a function in the global namespace with a very specific syntax that a user (like me) might want to see much more general. In your version, you are forcing the additive character used in the Gauss sum to be given by the trace, but it is not the only one additive character of `GF(q)`. The input of a Gauss sum should be a pair `(multiplicative_character, additive_character)`. If a global `gauss_sum` is introduced it should support this generality.

A possible solution is to replace the input of `p` and `f` by `GF(q)`, make the function as `gauss_sum(chi, psi=None)` and allow the following inputs
- `gauss_sum(chi, psi)`: the Gauss sum of the multiplicative character `chi` and additive character `psi` (would not be currently implemented)
- `gauss_sum(chi)`: `chi` a Dirichlet character
- `gauss_sum(char_value, finite_field)`: the Gauss sum of the multiplicative character `chi` as you have in the current version and `psi` being given by the trace

What do you think?

Let me thank you for looking at my ticket. I understand that a review is not necessarily a joyful process. I am trying to remain perfectly zen.

Note that I am adding no function to the global namespace. This is only a specialized function, to be used in a specific context.

I understand that you would like to have a fully general function. I did not intend to spend a lot of time on this simple ticket, and would prefer not to.
