Since #23192, `some_elements` is non-trivial for number fields/orders. This exposed the following problem:

```
sage: k = CyclotomicField(3)
sage: TestSuite(k).run()
Failure in _test_gcd_vs_xgcd:
...
AssertionError: The methods gcd and xgcd disagree on Cyclotomic Field of order 3 and degree 2:
  gcd(0,2) = 1
 xgcd(0,2) = (2, 0, 1)
```

Component: **number fields**
