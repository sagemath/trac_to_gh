namely

```
sage: K.<a, b> = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3])
sage: e, u, v, w = End(K)
sage: e.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: u.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: v.abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of number fields
sage: (v*v).abs_hom().parent().category()
Category of homsets of unital magmas and additive unital additive magmas
```
The last one should be the same as the other ones..

```

<a id='comment:2'></a>So the problem comes down to this:

```
sage: v.parent() is End(K)
True
sage: v.parent() is Hom(K, K, category=NumberFields())
True
sage: (v*v).parent() == End(K)
True
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is End(K)  # The issue
False
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is (v*v).parent()
True
```
The source of which, when you go down `_composition_`, comes from this:

```
sage: v.category_for()  # Which calls
Category of rings
sage: v.parent().homset_category()
Category of rings
```
The latter should be `NumberFields()`, not `Rings()` because the subclass

```
sage.rings.number_field.morphism.NumberFieldHomset
```
does not pass `NumberFields()` as its category. However, I tried passing the category of the domain, but this causes failures because `ComplexLazyField` is not a number field and issues with `CyclotomicField` that I don't understand.
