<div id="comment:2" align="right">comment:2</div>

So the problem comes down to this:

```
sage: v.parent() is End(K)
True
sage: v.parent() is Hom(K, K, category=NumberFields())
True
sage: (v*v).parent() == End(K)
True
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is End(K)  # The issue
False
sage: Hom(K, K, category=Rings()) is (v*v).parent()
True
```
The source of which, when you go down `_composition_`, comes from this:

```
sage: v.category_for()  # Which calls
Category of rings
sage: v.parent().homset_category()
Category of rings
```
The latter should be `NumberFields()`, not `Rings()` because the subclass

```
sage.rings.number_field.morphism.NumberFieldHomset
```
does not pass `NumberFields()` as its category. However, I tried passing the category of the domain, but this causes failures because `ComplexLazyField` is not a number field and issues with `CyclotomicField` that I don't understand.

No, I don't as it didn't work. However, I basically just added this to `number_field/morphism.py`:

```python
class NumberFieldHomset(RingHomset_generic):  # This was already there
    def __init__(self, R, S, category=None):
        if category is None:
            from sage.categories.number_fields import NumberFields
            category = NumberFields()
        RingHomset_generic(self, R, S, category)
```
and the other variant I tried was

```python
    def __init__(self, R, S, category=None):
        if category is None:
            category = R.category()
        RingHomset_generic(self, R, S, category)
```
