After the zlib upgrade, I cannot no longer run Sage under plain Python:

ImportError: /lib64/libz.so.1: version `ZLIB_1.2.9' not found (required by /opt/sage/sage-git/local/lib/libpng16.so.16)
```

This is because there is some kind of race condition: certain system libraries (OpenSSL for example) link against `/lib64/libz.so.1` while Sage components link against the Sage-built libz.

In turns out that the first libz library which is loaded "wins": that one will be used by anything linking against `libz`. When starting IPython, the correct libz library is loaded because some IPython component uses libz. When running plain Python, this is not the case and the wrong libz is loaded. The easiest fix is to explicitly `import libz` when Sage starts up.
