<a id='comment:7'></a>All doctests pass on src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_ring_homomorphism.pyx.
When testing doctests on src/sage/rings, I get the following output at the end:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --warn-long 37.9 src/sage/rings/finite_rings/finite_field_prime_modn.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --warn-long 37.9 src/sage/rings/morphism.pyx  # 2 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

I think that maybe the failures in morphism.pyx are related to #23485. However, I am not sure about finite_field_prime_modn.py.
