From the same 32bit VM, but outside Sage tree (hence using Debian compilation tools, not the ones provided by Sage), i pulled the master branch, and could reproduce the test error for `test_pruner`. Then by applying the pull request 246, the tests pass.

So i guess it will fix the issue when integrated into Sage.

I had to rename `tests-long-double.patch` to make explicit that both patches touch the same file and that they have to be applied in that order.

It works well on  my 64bit laptop. I still have to test it on my 32bit VM, i have no time right now.
