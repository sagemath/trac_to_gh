From the same 32bit VM, but outside Sage tree (hence using Debian compilation tools, not the ones provided by Sage), i pulled the master branch, and could reproduce the test error for `test_pruner`. Then by applying the pull request 246, the tests pass.

So i guess it will fix the issue when integrated into Sage.
