I noticed a while ago that my `/tmp` directory was filling up often, and it seems to be that every time I run the Sage tests I'm left with ~650 temp DLLs generated by ECL totaling around 8 GB.  This is even with a fully successful test run.

Just starting Maxima with `sage -maxima` causes three temp DLLs to be created, but they are properly deleted upon exiting.  Likewise, running commands in Sage with the `maxima` interface creates DLLs, but they are cleaned up when Sage exits.  It seems like maybe when running the test suite Maxima isn't always exited cleanly, and the temp files do not get tidied up.

I haven't attempted to patch ECL for this yet; its signal handling code is a bit complex and I think I need to understand it better before doing so.

However, this provides a workaround that I think is worth having with or without a patch to ECL for this: This ensures that when ECL and/or Maxima are called from Sage, rather than writing temp files to `/tmp` it uses `SAGE_TMP`.  This way an individual Sage session can take responsibility for cleaning up any temp files created by ECL/Maxima processes it spawns (or that it creates through the `sage.libs.ecl` interface).

As far as I'm concerned this solves the problem from Sage's end.

Reviewers set to Emmanuel Charpentier (revert)
    Status changed from needs_review to positive_review

On a Virtulbox running Windows10 professional, I compiled 8.0.rc0 + #21399 + #23359 (as suggested in ​the Wiki) + #21233 + #23097 (present ticket) with the options :

export PREREQ_OPTIONS=--with-blas=atlas
export SAGE_ATLAS_LIB=/usr/lib
export MAKE="make -j4"

This passes ptestlong with no failures.

==> positive_review

Note : I have no advice on the contents of the patches (I do not know Cygwin well enough to undetstand what they are supposed to do) ; I just checked that this leads to a functional Sage.
