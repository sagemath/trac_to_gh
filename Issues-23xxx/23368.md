We already do:

```
sage: sqrt(4/9*x)
2/3*sqrt(x)
sage: sqrt(-4*x)
2*sqrt(-x)
sage: (4*x + 12)^(-3)
1/64/(x + 3)^3
sage: (4/9*x)^(3/2)
8/27*x^(3/2)
```
This should be extended to rational exponents of sums: 

```
sage: sqrt(-4*x-4)
sqrt(-4*x - 4)
sage: (4*x + 12)^(-3/2)
(4*x + 12)^(-3/2)
```
It's a matter of implementing the case `add^rational` in Pynac's `power::eval`

Thanks for Cc'ing me !

I'm not convinced that's necessarily the Right Thing (TM) to do : it might prohibit more interesting operations, such as factorization after `expand()`.


I was thinking of adding (after 8.0) a few methods for symbolic expressions, such as `x.simplify_sum()` (a wrapper for `x.maxima_methods().ev(simpsum=True`) and possibly a collection of useful-but-not-always-pertinent transformations (such as trig (e. g. conversions to `tan(x/2)`, rewriting products as sums and vice-versa, etc...) that might be easier to call at willwityh such "syntactic sugar" methods.

Changing Maxima's domain can be done easily enough for one evaluation of a given expression E by asking `E.maxima_methods().ev(domain=real)`, or for the long term via `maxima_calculus("domain:real")`.

Could we take a bit of time to think about what would be useful to implement in such methods ? This simplification is an obvious candidate, but probably not the only one, and probably not as a *systematic* simplification.

I'm also considering extending `E.distribute()` to the case of the distribution of a differentiation over a sum ; I'm not yet convinced it is useful, but I'm looking for reasons (//pro// or *contra*). 

BTW, this (as well as your previous work on symbolic sums and products) and the recent `distribute()` should be reported back to Maxima (but the implementation is not as easy in Maxima/lisp as in Sage...).

Furthermore, let's not forget that *"Syntactic sucar causes cancer of the semicolon"* (A. J. Perlis, IIRC) : in other words, let's not paint ourselves in a too-difficult-to-maintain corner.

Fact is, there is already such simplification with integer exponents. Please give an example where extension to rational should not be allowed. Note also there is a canonical form Pynac adheres to and that affects if this simplification is applied (leading coeff positive). Note too that the long term goal is to become more independent from Maxima, for known reasons.

Replying to [@rwst](#comment%3A3):
> Fact is, there is already such simplification with integer exponents. Please give an example where extension to rational should not be allowed.

No example on hand at the moment, but ISTR to have been bitten by too-eager simplifications in integration of trig functions (undergrad-level exercises...) : "obvious" changes of variable became largely unobvious, and some factorizations were missed.

>Note also there is a canonical form Pynac adheres to and that affects if this simplification is applied (leading coeff positive).

And that sometimes gives birth to strange expressions, that have to be re-massaged. A minimal example (quoted from memory, no Sage available ATM) :

```
var("y,z,k,theta", domain="positive")
assume(k,"noninteger")
dbeta(y,k,theta)=y^(k-1)*e^-(y/theta)/(theta^k*gamma(k)
integrate(dbeta(z,k,theta)*dbeta(y-z,k,theta),z,0,y) ## Fails (returns an unevaluated integral)
integrate((dbeta(z,k,theta)*dbeta(y-z,k,theta)).expand(),z,0,y) ## Succeeds
```

> Note too that the long term goal is to become more independent from Maxima, for known reasons.

Agreed. But I have to confess that, to me at least, Maxima is muche easier to grasp than Pynac (my command of C++ is not up to the level of mt grasp of Lisp and Maxima...).

Actually a better alternative is to draw only the rational part of the root outside. The new patch does it and "fails" only these tests:

```
File "src/sage/calculus/calculus.py", line 233, in sage.calculus.calculus
Failed example:
    f.derivative(x)
Expected:
    1/3/sqrt(1/9*x^2 + 1)
Got:
    1/sqrt(x^2 + 9)

File "src/sage/functions/hypergeometric.py", line 776, in sage.functions.hypergeometric.closed_form
Failed example:
    closed_form(hypergeometric([1, 1, 2], [1, 1], z))
Expected:
    (z - 1)^(-2)
Got:
    1/(z - 1)^2
```
Do you agree the failures are okay?

I'm still investigating the fails in `src/doc`.

That `sqrt(23)*sqrt(3)` is not combined should be addressed elsewhere.

Exactly why I got cold feet with the (much smaller) distribution of a few operations over `sum` and `product`, and created `distribute`. Seconded.

> ---but maybe as separate method.

`canonicalize_power(s)` (parallel to `canonicalize_radical`) ?

Another possibility to discuss : extend `canonicalize_radical` : same category of operations, but this would change its definition.
