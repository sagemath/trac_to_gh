Lol Well, I think mine is a little better in terms of layout, but I like your hidden toctree. Can you make a hybrid branch?

You should really check once more if it builds for you after a `make doc-clean` because here it doesn't and with the patchbot it won't. This is really peculiar because in `prep/Quickstart...` there are links to a level higher that work. It would be interesting if it builds for you always.
