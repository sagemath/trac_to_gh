First of all, the documentation `sage.repl.preparse.containing_block` function is unclear. Second, it seems to return wrong results.

I suppose that `containing_block(s, idx)` is supposed to contain `a,b` such that `s[a:b]` is the smallest substring with matching parentheses containing `idx`.

Actually the role of `idx` is not stated in the documentation. From some tests, it seems that we will have `a<idx`. The following seems wrong to me:

1. `s[a:b]` actually is not always balanced:

```
sage: from sage.repl.preparse import containing_block
sage: containing_block('((a))',1)
(0, 4)
sage: '((a))'[0:4]
'((a)'
sage: containing_block('([a)',1)
(0, 4)
sage: '([a)'[0:4]
'([a)'
sage: containing_block('(a])',1)
(0, 4)
sage: '(a])'[0:4]
'(a])'
```

2. Some corner cases:

```
sage: containing_block('()',1)
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: Unbalanced or missing ()'s
sage: containing_block('()',0)
  File "<string>", line unknown
SyntaxError: Unbalanced or missing ()'s
```

Suggested fix:
1. The specification should be:
   - `s[a:b]` is minimal balanced (in particular we have `s[a]` and opening and `s[b-1]` a closing bracket)
   - `a<=idx<b` (in particular, the char at position `idx` is part of `s[a:b]`)
2. The specification should be documented.

**Keywords:** balanced parentheses, containing_block
