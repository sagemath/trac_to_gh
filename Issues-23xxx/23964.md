}
```
Minimal case:

```
sage: (I*x).subs(I==0)
I*x
```
Originally:

the `substitute` command does not work with `I`:

```
sage: f = sin(x*I)+I*x^2+cos(exp(I))
sage: f.subs(I=0)
I*x^2 + cos(e^I) + sin(I*x)
```

Depends on #24838

Component: **calculus**

```
sage: f = sin(x*I)+I*x^2+cos(exp(I))
sage: f

sage: f.subs({I:0})

sage: f.subs({2:0})
