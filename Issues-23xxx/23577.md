The implementation of the global `is_squarefree` method eventually uses `return all(r[1] == 1 for r in factor(n))`.  A more mathematically sensible definition is that `x` is squarefree if and only if it is not divisible by the square of any non-unit.  For fields, this means that `0` is not squarefree and everything else is squarefree.

Of course, this can be confusing for beginners who now have to deal with `(4/1).is_squarefree()` returning `True`.
