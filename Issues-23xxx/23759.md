The benchmarks listed in the [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) website, wiki and docs seem to be out of date.

1. http://www.sagemath.org/tour-benchmarks.html
   * [SageMath](../wiki/SageMath) is now on version 8 (instead of 4)
   * Mathematica is now on version 11 (instead of 7)
   * Probably last edited on June, 2009.
2. https://wiki.sagemath.org/symbench
   * Most of the issues raised in "Sage Gets the Answer All Wrong or Just Can't Do It" seem to be solved.
    * Problem W3 still seems to be present.
    * Problem W5 outputs a similar result, but I'm not sure as to what the expected result is.
   * Language is a bit hostile.
3. https://wiki.sagemath.org/sagebeatsmagma
   * Last updated on June 2009.
4. http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/calculus/sage/symbolic/benchmark.html
   * These are supposed to be taken from the symbench entry.
   * Some problems are missing (R8, R9), and others have different values (R11).

great idea!

to get started, in the symbench wiki,

- i've removed the insult
- for Problem W1, now Sage gives a non-empty list:

```
solve([eqn1,eqn2,a==1/8],b,c,a)
[a == (1/8), a - e^(-pi*b/sqrt(-b + 1)) == 0, c - arctan(2*b*sqrt(-1/(2*b^2 - sqrt(4*b^4 + 1)))) == 0]
```

- similar for W2 (correct answer):

```
sage: %time f = factor(x^20 - (2^(1/3))^5*y^20)
CPU times: user 430 ms, sys: 971 µs, total: 431 ms
Wall time: 432 ms
sage: f
-(2^(2/3)*x^8*y^8 + 2^(1/3)*x^12*y^4 + 2*2^(1/3)*y^16 + x^16 + 2*x^4*y^12)*(2^(1/3)*y^4 - x^4)
```

- and the output of W3 is the same as Mathematica,

```
sage: acos(cos(x))
arccos(cos(x))
sage: cos(acos(x))
x
```

i guess that these tests no longer belong to the section "Sage gets it wrong", but still, there is a value of keeping them. what do to with them, should we place them in section "RXX"?

On R11, there is still a somewhat passive-aggresive remark:
> *They fortunately didn't conclude that Sage is completely useless.*

I would propose that, if 'Sage gets it wrong', the proper place to complain about it (and get it fixed) is to create an issue/ticket. I don't think it's good to place those in the Wiki.

Also, the intended purpose of showcasing Benchmarks is to demonstrate that complicated identities or symbolic calculations are done at a comparable (or faster) speed than SageMath's competitors.

item 1., http://www.sagemath.org/tour-benchmarks.html , corresponds to the issue in the sagemath webpage: https://github.com/sagemath/website/issues/29 , thus we need to submit a pull request there.

i can produce numbers for Matlab r2016a which should be recent enough in a macbook pro. however, i don't have Mathematica software.
