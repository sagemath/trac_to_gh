There are several independent implementations in Sage to determine the number of threads or processors for a parallel computation. Instead, these should be one way to do that and it should support the environment variable `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`, which is precisely meant for that.

On top of that, doctests should never use too many threads. So we set `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=2` while doctesting, analogous to #23892.

This fixes doctests in:
- parallel map/reduce
- cryptominisat
- cbc package: coin backend for MILP

Hi Jeroen, 

Thanks for taking care of this one (and all the others) ! It's good to go for me. I assume that the limit `SAGE_NUM_THREADS=2` si set up to be able to doctests on small machines. It seems a little low to me. I'd rather put 4 just to shake up a little the parallel feature. Except for that, everything loos ok to me.

Florent
