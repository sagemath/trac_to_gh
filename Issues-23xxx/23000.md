Finite dimensional modules over a finite field are known to Sage to be finite:

```
    sage: Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional().is_subcategory(Sets().Finite())
    True
```

However this piece of knowledge was ignored if a
base ring category instead of a base ring was passed to `Modules`:

```
    sage: Modules(Field().Finite()).FiniteDimensional().is_subcategory(Sets().Finite())
    True
```

This ticket fixes this.

## Comments

This is yet another avatar of the current lack of robustness of
categories over base rings. With #20962 which will make module
categories singletons, this kind of inconsistency won't be possible
anymore.

This issue was discovered while tracking a bug in #18700 which
implemented a new category `AdditiveGroups.Finite`, which triggered
the following doctest failure:

```
sage: K = simplicial_complexes.Simplex(2)
sage: H = Hom(K,K)
sage: id = H.identity()
sage: id.induced_homology_morphism(GF(13)).base_ring()
Traceback (most recent call last)
.../opt/sage-git2/src/sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx in sage.misc.c3_controlled.C3_sorted_merge (/opt/sage-git2/src/build/cythonized/sage/misc/c3_controlled.c:5151)()
    936                     heads[j] = X
    937                     tailset = tailsets[j]
--> 938                     tailset.remove(key(X))
    939                 else:
    940                     del heads[j]

KeyError: (258, 65)
```

## Detailed analysis

Recall that:

- categories are endowed with a total order which is used to ensure
  that the Method Resolution Orders chosen by Python are always
  consistent. This total order shall refine the subcategory relation.
  This is achieved by assigning a comparison key to each category
  according to the order in which they are created (and some further
  data)

- To avoid creating many copies of the same hierarchy of classes,
  parametrized categories may share their parent/element/... classes,
  and therefore the same comparison key.

In the case at hand,
`C1=Modules(Fields().Finite().FiniteDimensional()` was created first.
Since it was not a subcategory of `A=AdditiveGroups().Finite()`, there
was no constraint on their relative comparison keys; it then turned
out that `C` was assigned a comparison key smaller than that of `A`.

Later on, when `C2=Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional()` got created, it
got the same comparison key as `C1` while simultaneously deriving from
`A`, breaking the assumption.

-This is yet another avatar of lack of robustness of categories over

-be singleton. To get the ball rolling for #18700 which is otherwise
-ready, this ticket provides a quick workaround which should be robust
-enough for now.
-
-
 ## Detailed analysis
 
-Recall that
+Recall that:
 
 - categories are endowed with a total order which is used to ensure
   that the Method Resolution Orders chosen by Python are always
   consistent. This total order shall refine the subcategory relation.
   This is achieved by assigning a comparison key to each category
-  according to the order in which they are created.
-
-- To make the total order more reproducible from one session to the
-  other, the first piece of the comparison key is given by a bit array
-  of flags which are set according to whether the category is a
-  subcategory of some "atom categories": `FacadeSets`, `FiniteSets`, ...
+  according to the order in which they are created (and some further
+  data)
 
 - To avoid creating many copies of the same hierarchy of classes,
   parametrized categories may share their parent/element/... classes,
   and therefore the same comparison key.
 
-  In the case at hand, depending on the order in which categories were
-  created, the assumption of refining the subcategory relation got
-  broken (I still need to analyze this precisely):
-  `Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional()` got a key smaller than its
-  super category `AdditiveGroup().Finite()`
+In the case at hand,
+`C1=Modules(Fields().Finite().FiniteDimensional()` was created first.
+Since it was not a subcategory of `A=AdditiveGroups().Finite()`, there
+was no constraint on their relative comparison keys; it then turned
+out that `C` was assigned a comparison key smaller than that of `A`.
 
-This risk will vanish by itself when module categories will be
-singleton. In the mean time, adding "Modules" to the list of atom
-categories guarantee that `AdditiveGroups().Finite()` gets a strictly
-smaller key.
+Later on, when `C2=Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional()` got created, it
+got the same comparison key as `C1` while simultaneously deriving from
+`A`, breaking the assumption.
