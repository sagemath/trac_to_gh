Finite dimensional modules over a finite field are known to Sage to be finite:

```
    sage: Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional().is_subcategory(Sets().Finite())
    True
```

However this piece of knowledge was ignored if a
base ring category instead of a base ring was passed to `Modules`:

```
    sage: Modules(Field().Finite()).FiniteDimensional().is_subcategory(Sets().Finite())
    True
```

This ticket fixes this.

## Comments

This is yet another avatar of the current lack of robustness of
categories over base rings. With #20962 which will make module
categories singletons, this kind of inconsistency won't be possible
anymore.

This issue was discovered while tracking a bug in #18700 which
implemented a new category `AdditiveGroups.Finite`, which triggered
the following doctest failure:

```
sage: K = simplicial_complexes.Simplex(2)
sage: H = Hom(K,K)
sage: id = H.identity()
sage: id.induced_homology_morphism(GF(13)).base_ring()
Traceback (most recent call last)
.../opt/sage-git2/src/sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx in sage.misc.c3_controlled.C3_sorted_merge (/opt/sage-git2/src/build/cythonized/sage/misc/c3_controlled.c:5151)()
    936                     heads[j] = X
    937                     tailset = tailsets[j]
--> 938                     tailset.remove(key(X))
    939                 else:
    940                     del heads[j]

KeyError: (258, 65)
```

## Detailed analysis

Recall that:

- categories are endowed with a total order which is used to ensure
  that the Method Resolution Orders chosen by Python are always
  consistent. This total order shall refine the subcategory relation.
  This is achieved by assigning a comparison key to each category
  according to the order in which they are created (and some further
  data)

- To avoid creating many copies of the same hierarchy of classes,
  parametrized categories may share their parent/element/... classes,
  and therefore the same comparison key.

In the case at hand,
`C1=Modules(Fields().Finite().FiniteDimensional()` was created first.
Since it was not a subcategory of `A=AdditiveGroups().Finite()`, there
was no constraint on their relative comparison keys; it then turned
out that `C` was assigned a comparison key smaller than that of `A`.

Later on, when `C2=Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional()` got created, it
got the same comparison key as `C1` while simultaneously deriving from
`A`, breaking the assumption.

<a id='comment:6'></a>Okay, I think I understand why this change is needed. Did you manage to track down the detail you mentioned in comment:3?

+Finite dimensional modules over a finite field are known to Sage to be finite:

+
+## Comments
+
+This is yet another avatar of the current lack of robustness of
+categories over base rings. With #20962 which will make module
+categories singletons, this kind of inconsistency won't be possible
+anymore.
+
+This issue was discovered while tracking a bug in #18700 which
+implemented a new category `AdditiveGroups.Finite`, which triggered
+the following doctest failure:
+
+```
+sage: K = simplicial_complexes.Simplex(2)
+sage: H = Hom(K,K)
+sage: id = H.identity()
+sage: id.induced_homology_morphism(GF(13)).base_ring()

+.../opt/sage-git2/src/sage/misc/c3_controlled.pyx in sage.misc.c3_controlled.C3_sorted_merge (/opt/sage-git2/src/build/cythonized/sage/misc/c3_controlled.c:5151)()

+
+## Detailed analysis
+
+Recall that:
+
+- categories are endowed with a total order which is used to ensure
+  that the Method Resolution Orders chosen by Python are always
+  consistent. This total order shall refine the subcategory relation.
+  This is achieved by assigning a comparison key to each category
+  according to the order in which they are created (and some further
+  data)
+
+- To avoid creating many copies of the same hierarchy of classes,
+  parametrized categories may share their parent/element/... classes,
+  and therefore the same comparison key.
+
+In the case at hand,
+`C1=Modules(Fields().Finite().FiniteDimensional()` was created first.
+Since it was not a subcategory of `A=AdditiveGroups().Finite()`, there
+was no constraint on their relative comparison keys; it then turned
+out that `C` was assigned a comparison key smaller than that of `A`.
+
+Later on, when `C2=Modules(GF(3)).FiniteDimensional()` got created, it
+got the same comparison key as `C1` while simultaneously deriving from
+`A`, breaking the assumption.
