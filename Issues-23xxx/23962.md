sage: E2 = EllipticCurve('571a1')
sage: E2.rank()
Unable to compute the rank with certainty (lower bound=0).
This could be because Sha(E/Q)[2] is nontrivial.
Try calling something like two_descent(second_limit=13) on the
curve then trying this command again.  You could also try rank
with only_use_mwrank=False.

RuntimeError: Rank not provably correct.
```

The problem is that `E1` and `E2` are the same curve, but constructed in a different way. When the first line is removed, the rank computation works. The reason is that `EllipticCurve('571a1')` looks up the elliptic curve in the Cremona database (which includes the fact that the rank is 0) but **only if the curve does not exist already**.

The solution seems easy: **always** look up the rank of elliptic curves in the database.

I am also simplifying and cleaning up the implementation of `rank()` a bit.

This ticket leads to random doctest failures (which is how this was originally reported):

Replying to [@tscrim](#comment%3A1):

I don't think so. I was reported om sage-release to fail on Sage 8.1.beta7.

The code seems to involve the Cremona database and the `eclib` library, not PARI/GP.

I don't understand the failure though: the curve is contained in the small Cremona database which is installed by default. So the rank should just be read from the database.

+
+The problem is that `E1` and `E2` are the same curve, but constructed in a different way. When the first line is removed, the rank computation works. The reason is that `EllipticCurve('571a1')` looks up the elliptic curve in the Cremona database (which includes the fact that the rank is 0) but **only if the curve does not exist already**.
+
+The solution seems easy: **always** look up the rank of elliptic curves in the database.

As far as I can tell :

* `EllipticCurve` is standard
* therefore, *<some elliptic_curve>*`.rank()` is also standard
* `database_cremona_ellcurve` is optional

If you wish to *always* consult Cremona database in any case, `database_cremona_ellcurve` should become standard.

Unless I am gravely mistaken, of course...

There is a small database which is standard. So consulting "the" Cremona database really means: the large one if that's installed, otherwise the small one.

Also, I'm not saying that consulting always must succeed. The code to get the rank from the database is wrapped in a `try:`/`except LookupError:` block and I'm not changing that.

A couple of comments.

1. When the new output incudes something like "(guess = 0)" it is not a guess, it is a proved lower bound.  (Not saying a lot if it is zero, but it can be positive).   Please change "guess" to "lower bound".

2. I see that the cached rank is no longer a dict with True/False keys but a single pair (r,T/F).  I don't know the reason for this change.  I may try to compute the rank with Proof=True (default), got a warning an retired with Proof=False.  How does this behave now?

Fixed the caching of non-proven output from `eclib` and the exception message.

Hi Jeroen, 

Very nice that you found out the cause. I'm trying to see the link to your example and the doctest failure. Because your example fails 100% of the time while the doctest only fails sporadically. Is the explanation that the curve E1 is actually already created on
line 362  with `sage: E = EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])       # 571A` and that it is quite random wether this curve still exists or is already garbage collected around the line 915 where the doctest failure occurs?

In the mean time I was able to replicate the doctest failure on arando. I needed to test it with `sage -t --global-iterations 1000` before an error showed up. It started failing on the 775th iteration and then it kept failing until the 798th doctest. This might indicate that the randomness might depend on the system load (objects being garbage collected sooner maybe).

P.s. I think it would be good to add the doctest:

```
    sage: E1 = EllipticCurve([0, -1, 1, -929, -10595])
    sage: E2 = EllipticCurve('571a1')
    sage: E2.rank()
    0
```
at the top of the file to make sure that we now have a doctest that fails 100% of the time prior to your fix, but works after it.

That's what the 1888b1 (*) test does. It's testing the essence of this patch, namely that `rank()` should work for curves which are in the database but which are not constructed using the Cremona label. Personally, I don't think that adding `E2 = EllipticCurve('1888b1')` would add anything interesting to that test.

Thanks for this explanation, the test itself suffices, and I am happy with the rest of the code (although there might be some nitpicking that your tuple instead of dict change made the caching of `.__gens` and the `.__rank` less consistent and I like coding style consistency).

I would like to add a little bit more explanation to this test later this evening (I have to leave now). Since now the text around this test does not seem to make clear the subtle issue that different ways of initialising the same globally unique elliptic curve should give actually an object that behaves the same (ok it has the link to this trac ticket).

The fact that "Elliptic curves are globally unique even if they are initialized differently" is already tested in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/constructor.py`

So there is no need for the extra test

```
        Elliptic curves are globally unique even if they are initialized differently::

            sage: E1 = EllipticCurve([-517, -4528])
            sage: E2 = EllipticCurve('1888b1')
            sage: E1 is E2
            True
```
