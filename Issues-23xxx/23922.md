Does this require a more recent version of FLINT?

I can make a new tarball with this changed (lines 19176 and 19187 in configure).

It is very easy to [check for headers](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Generic-Headers.html#Generic-Headers) in a `configure` script. You could check for `flint/hmod_mat.h` and set `FLINT_LEVEL` accordingly.

Can you tell me more about this special version of FLINT? Is this officially released somewhere, or is it for John Cremona's eyes only?

This particular piece of code was borrowed from an old version of Stoll's ratpoints so the author is not quite who you think it is.  It should probably be 

```
if((!use_odd_nums) && !(b&1))
```

but it might be a good idea to look into ratpoints (already built for Sage)... around line 118 of ratpoints' sift.c.  But this if() statement is no longer there.

Your next question will be: why does eclib not actually use ratpoints itself?  I don't have time to answer that now.
