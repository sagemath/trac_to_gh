Unfortunately, it doesn't build:

```
[eclib-20171002] mat.cc:1485:28: fatal error: flint/hmod_mat.h: No such file or directory
[eclib-20171002]  #include "flint/hmod_mat.h"
```

Does this require a more recent version of FLINT?

I can make a new tarball with this changed (lines 19176 and 19187 in configure).

By the way the README file has this information :)

It is very easy to [check for headers](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Generic-Headers.html#Generic-Headers) in a `configure` script. You could check for `flint/hmod_mat.h` and set `FLINT_LEVEL` accordingly.

Can you tell me more about this special version of FLINT? Is this officially released somewhere, or is it for John Cremona's eyes only?

on a clang I see

This particular piece of code was borrowed from an old version of Stoll's ratpoints so the author is not quite who you think it is.  It should probably be 

```
if((!use_odd_nums) && !(b&1))
```

but it might be a good idea to look into ratpoints (already built for Sage)... around line 118 of ratpoints' sift.c.  But this if() statement is no longer there.

Your next question will be: why does eclib not actually use ratpoints itself?  I don't have time to answer that now.
