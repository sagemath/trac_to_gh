<a id='comment:15'></a>Unfortunately, it doesn't build:

```
[eclib-20171002] mat.cc:1485:28: fatal error: flint/hmod_mat.h: No such file or directory
[eclib-20171002]  #include "flint/hmod_mat.h"
```

Does this require a more recent version of FLINT?

It is very easy to [check for headers](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Generic-Headers.html#Generic-Headers) in a `configure` script. You could check for `flint/hmod_mat.h` and set `FLINT_LEVEL` accordingly.

Can you tell me more about this special version of FLINT? Is this officially released somewhere, or is it for John Cremona's eyes only?
