The latter is usually created by the former by running a command like `make dist`. It differs from a git repo by including also some auto-generated files (for example, `configure` in your case).\n\nNote that it is possible to use Travis CI to automatically create proper releases, see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/",

It is very easy to [check for headers](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Generic-Headers.html#Generic-Headers) in a `configure` script. You could check for `flint/hmod_mat.h` and set `FLINT_LEVEL` accordingly.

Can you tell me more about this special version of FLINT? Is this officially released somewhere, or is it for John Cremona's eyes only?

```

but it might be a good idea to look into ratpoints (already built for Sage)... around line 118 of ratpoints' sift.c.  But this if() statement is no longer there.

Your next question will be: why does eclib not actually use ratpoints itself?  I don't have time to answer that now.
