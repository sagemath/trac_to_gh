Arithmetic with complex `I` may involve symbolic equation solving using Maxima because `QQbar` calls `minpoly.roots` every time, which uses Maxima's solve for symbolic output. Special code in `sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_element.pyx` reduces time 100x for the first call (Maxima startup) and 2x for any following.
