Keywords: thursdaysbdx

With gap pexpect interface

```
sage: gap.LoadPackage('"cryst"')
true
sage: gap.SpaceGroupIT(2,14)
SpaceGroupOnRightIT(2,14,'1')
```
With libgap

```
sage: libgap.LoadPackage("cryst")
true
sage: libgap.SpaceGroupIT(2,14)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
AttributeError: No such attribute: SpaceGroupIT.
```

As noticed in #23854, there is the following work around

```
sage: libgap.eval('SpaceGroupIT')(2,14)
SpaceGroupOnRightIT(2,14,'1')
```

This is fixed since some time ago.  You could use any package to demonstrate, but I installed the cryst package to demonstrate the same example:

```
sage: libgap.load_package('cryst')                                                                                                                                                               
true
sage: libgap.SpaceGroupIT(2,14)                                                                                                                                                                  
SpaceGroupOnRightIT(2,14,'1')
```

This was likely fixed by #27911.
