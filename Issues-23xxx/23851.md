In #11670 the following leak was introduced:

```
        sage: u=id(NumberField(x^2-5,'a').absolute_field('b'))
        sage: import gc
        sage: gc.collect() #random
        10
        sage: [id(v) for v in gc.get_objects() if id(v) == u]
```

See Nils's explanation in[comment:14](#comment%3A14):ticket:23807 and the surrounding discussion, where this bug was found.

These new changes are just showing that the doctests were fragile to begin with. There's a bunch of things you can do to check the result is correct:

One argument for caching a method is when it takes long time to compute which is not the case here:

```
sage: %time nf = NumberField(x^2-5,'a')
CPU times: user 1.12 ms, sys: 97 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 962 µs
sage: %time nf.absolute_field('b')
CPU times: user 9 µs, sys: 1e+03 ns, total: 10 µs
Wall time: 13.8 µs
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
```

Is there another reason why `absolute_field` should be cached?
