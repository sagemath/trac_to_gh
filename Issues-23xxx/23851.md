```
In #11670 the following leak was introduced:

```
        sage: u=id(NumberField(x^2-5,'a').absolute_field('b'))
        sage: import gc
        sage: gc.collect() #random
        10
        sage: [id(v) for v in gc.get_objects() if id(v) == u]
```

See Nils's explanation in [#23807 comment:14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23807#comment:14) and the surrounding discussion, where this bug was found.

I confirm that I get the same errors when run alone:

```
 sage -t src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py
```

I am sorry, I do not know what happened with my run of `make ptestlong` which said `All tests passed`. I rechecked the log file of ptestlong.log, and I confirm that I got `All tests passed`:

Commit 55a59ff (see [comment:7](#comment%3A7)) reduces the randomness in the number of times that `K` is constructed.

sage -t --long --warn-long 58.5 src/sage/rings/polynomial/polynomial_quotient_ring.py  # 9 doctests failed

When running `sage -t` alone on the file without the option `--long` , I get `All tests passed`:

But the failing tests are not marked with `long time` ... ??? Why are they not failing in the second case?

These new changes are just showing that the doctests were fragile to begin with. There's a bunch of things you can do to check the result is correct:
- look at the norms
- verify they and their inverses are S-integral (factorize the denominator)
- hard-code an S-unit basis and check that these occur as a power product of the computed set.
It's a pain, but I don't think we really have another option.
(I guess the answers only differ in some sign choices, so you could just construct the set of all sign choices and check your answer lies in there. That would be a reasonably strict test and will probably take a little longer before it breaks again)

Also, if you want to prevent the field from being garbage collected, just bind it explicitly to an identifier. That's how users should prevent garbage collections too. That doesn't help the non-deterministic doctests, though it may hide the problem for a while.

Replying to [@roed314](#comment%3A19):
> Do we really want to delete `@cached_method` on `absolute_field`?

One argument for caching a method is when it takes long time to compute which is not the case here:

```
sage: %time nf = NumberField(x^2-5,'a')
CPU times: user 1.12 ms, sys: 97 µs, total: 1.21 ms
Wall time: 962 µs
sage: %time nf.absolute_field('b')
CPU times: user 9 µs, sys: 1e+03 ns, total: 10 µs
Wall time: 13.8 µs
Number Field in b with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
```

Is there another reason why `absolute_field` should be cached?

Your timings, on a quadratic field which is already absolute, aren't particularly convincing that this method is always fast.  However, running some other tests on higher degree relative extensions shows that they're quite fast as well.  I'll withdraw my objection to removing the `cached_method`.

I don't really understand the memory leak. If the original code leaks, isn't that a deeper problem with `@cached_method`?

The leak is caused by the combination of `@cached_method` and `UniqueFactory`; see Nils's explanation in [#23807 comment:14](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23807#comment:14) and the surrounding discussion, where this bug was found.
