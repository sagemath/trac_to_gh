There's a test in `sage.structure.sage_object` like:

```
        sage: os.chmod(dir, 0o000)
        sage: try:
        ....:     uid = os.getuid()
        ....: except AttributeError:
        ....:     uid = -1
        sage: if uid==0:
        ....:     raise OSError('You must not run the doctests as root, geez!')
        ....: else:
        ....:     sage.structure.sage_object.picklejar(1, dir + '/noaccess')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        OSError: ...
```

This test normally works for me on my personal system, even under Cygwin.  However, I'm setting up the Cygwin patchbot, and found that this test always fails.

Although this can be worked around, this test can never be made truly reliable on Cygwin.  This is because Windows file permissions (ACLs) are much more complicated than traditional Unix permissions.  Cygwin (depending on how it's configured) can try to emulate Unix permissions on top of Windows ACLs, but there are holes in the system.  For example it's *possible* to set `0o000` on a directory, but still have it be writable by the current user, especially if that user is an Admin.  

In some sense this scenario is a misconfiguration that can be avoided.  But it's a factor external to Sage that's pretty hard to control, so this test should just be avoided on Cygwin.
