Currently sage allows

```
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: P(0)
(0 : 1)
sage: P = ProjectiveSpace(Q,2)
sage: P([0,0])
(0 : 0 : 1)
```

essentially by assuming a canonical embedding of affine space into projective space. See the discussion on sage-devel (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sage-devel/BPLTcvtJ4dM) concerning this.

Since this is current behavior a deprecation warning will be added and this ticket will be mainly fixing everywhere in Sage that currently relies on this behavior.
