```
In `sage/env.py`, the function `_add_variable_or_fallback` does some variable substitution: if a string contains `$VAR`, it substitutes the value of `VAR` in the dictionary `SAGE_ENV`. It does this by iterating through the items of `SAGE_ENV`, which means that if both `VAR` and `VAR_OTHER` are in `SAGE_ENV`, it's sort of a coin toss as to what happens when it comes across `$VAR_OTHER`.

(This arose when I was working on #21469: the string `$SAGE_SRC_ROOT` was being replaced by the value of `SAGE_SRC`, followed by the string `_ROOT`.)
