That doesn't answer my question.

Let me rephrase my question: there are 3 reasonable choices for the `language_level` option.

(A) Always `language_level=2` *(the current situation)*

(B) Always `language_level=3`

(C) `language_level=2` on Python 2 and `language_level=3` on Python 3

**Why** is (C) better than (A)?

And there is an additional question: why is (C) better than (B)?

I haven't looked at (B) because I didn't want to change the behaviour of Sage on Python 2.

Setting `language_level=3` on Python 3 helped to discover (some) import errors already at compile time and not at runtime. And I assume (haven't tested) that using `language_level=3` could lead to less `unicode` problems than using `language_level=2` and could simplify the way to Sage on Python 3.

Jeroen, you have more experience with Cython, so I assume you can provide more knowledge-based arguments for one or the other.

> Jeroen, you have more experience with Cython, so I assume you can provide more knowledge-based arguments for one or the other.

It's not really a Cython-specific thing, it's a more general philosophy. When writing Python code, you can try to

(A) use Python 2 semantics as much as possible

(B) use Python 3 semantics as much as possible

(C) use Python 2 semantics on Python 2 and Python 3 semantics on Python 3

For plain Python, (A) is not possible in many cases because Python 3 removes a feature (for example: `__cmp__`, string literals interpreted as `bytes`, `dict.iteritems`). With Cython, the sitation for (A) is better because some Python 2 features are supported by Cython regardless of Python version.

For plain Python, (B) is often possible (using `from __future__` imports or packages like `six`).

And (C) is usually where trouble lies (strings interpreted as `bytes`/`unicode` depending on the Python version, different division semantics...).

Based on this, I believe that (C) is the worst option. Of course, this is just a personal opinion...

I tried to compile sage on Python 2 with `language_level=3`. There are some issues like

```
Unicode objects only support coercion to Py_UNICODE*.
```
which should be easily fixable.
A bigger problem are errors like

```
names = ['A{}'.format(''.join(str(x) for x in sorted(F))) for F in flats]  
                                                     ^

sage/matroids/matroid.pyx:7527:66: local variable 'F' referenced before assignment
```
https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1159

https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1351

If we don't want to switch now, we should at least make the sage code as much level 3 compatible as possible to allow an easier transition later.

I agree in principle. On the other hand, I think this should literally be the last of our Python 3 worries. There is nothing really wrong with the status quo and there are plenty of other things which still need to be fixed for Python 3.

So I suggest to close this ticket as wontfix for now.

I thought we discussed this on sage-devel. Cython knows that `str = unicode` on Python 3 and string literals are `str = unicode` on Python 3, regardless of `language_level`.

Note that using `language_level=3` does turn on `from `__future__` import unicode_literals`. But on Python 3, that doesn't change anything.

I think I'm confused about this line in the docs:

> Unprefixed string literals become str objects when compiling with language level 2 and unicode objects (i.e. Python 3 str) with language level 3.

The first part of the sentence doesn't specify what they mean by "str", because this doesn't seem to agree with my experience of turning on `language_level=3` (where suddenly string literals were being treated as unicode and breaking whenever passed to an interface that expects `char *`).

Anyways, another reason to do this is that we'll probably want to use other Python 3 features eventually so it would be good to enable.

In Cython code, it's best to think of `bytes`, `str` and `unicode` as three distinct types (that's what Cython does internally). It just happes that `str is bytes` on Python 2 and `str is unicode` on Python 3.

So then, unprefixed string literals are `str` with `language_level=2` (exactly the same as in plain Python), they are `unicode` with `language_level=3` (exactly the same as in plain Python with `from `__future__` import unicode_literals`).

Maybe I did read that paragraph and *it* didn't make sense.

Let me clarify: when Cython compiles Cython code to C, it doesn't yet know if the C code will be compiled as Python 2 and Python 3. So when it sees a `"string"` literal, it doesn't really know what king of string it will be. To solve this, Cython internally really has 3 string types: `bytes`, `str` and `unicode`. Both `bytes` and `unicode` are easy to deal with, since they refer to the same type on Python 2 and Python 3 (*). To deal with `str`, it uses macros like

```
#if PY_MAJOR_VERSION >= 3
  #define PyBaseString_Type            PyUnicode_Type
  #define PyStringObject               PyUnicodeObject
  #define PyString_Type                PyUnicode_Type
  #define PyString_Check               PyUnicode_Check
  #define PyString_CheckExact          PyUnicode_CheckExact
#endif
```

(*) I know that they renamed `unicode` to `str` on Python 3, but that is really a superficial change in the Python language. The C API function names start with `PyUnicode`, and that is what Cython really cares about.

I didn't realize that even when compiling Python 3 sources Cython still defines "unicode" as a built-in, which is surprising--that's part of my confusion.

I was looking at the code myself just now, and I think my confusion with your explanation comes from the fact that you're referring to "three distinct types".  And it's true, that it has the *names* `unicode`, `str`, and `bytes` in all cases.  But that doesn't mean there are three distinct types.

Anyways we're in agreement that language_level doesn't do much in the end.  It does also make some difference in how string literals are parsed which might lead to confusion somewhere, but I don't think it's critical.

> But that doesn't mean there are three distinct types.

From Cython's point of view, there really are 3 types because Cython doesn't know whether the C code will be compiled as Python 2 or Python 3. It is only after the fact that it "happens" that str maps to bytes or unicode.

But the Cython compiler has 3 classes `BytesNode`, `UnicodeNode` and `StringNode` to deal with the 3 kinds of string constants. And this is where the `from `__future__` import unicode_literals` (which is implied by `language_level=3`) comes in: unprefixed `"string"` literals becomes `UnicodeNode` instead of `StringNode`.

FWIW this is also helpful:

```
    builtin_entries = {

        "type":   ["((PyObject*)&PyType_Type)", py_object_type],

        "bool":   ["((PyObject*)&PyBool_Type)", py_object_type],
        "int":    ["((PyObject*)&PyInt_Type)", py_object_type],
        "long":   ["((PyObject*)&PyLong_Type)", py_object_type],
        "float":  ["((PyObject*)&PyFloat_Type)", py_object_type],
        "complex":["((PyObject*)&PyComplex_Type)", py_object_type],

        "bytes":  ["((PyObject*)&PyBytes_Type)", py_object_type],
        "bytearray":   ["((PyObject*)&PyByteArray_Type)", py_object_type],
        "str":    ["((PyObject*)&PyString_Type)", py_object_type],
        "unicode":["((PyObject*)&PyUnicode_Type)", py_object_type],
        ...
```

This is how it determines certain built-in names.  Incidentally Python 2 has `#define PyBytes_Type PyString_Type` in its headers, but Python 3 does not have `#define PyString_Type PyUnicode_Type` which is why Cython has to include that explicitly.

I disagree with your read on the situation.  The parser/compiler may have three Node types which makes sense, but there aren't three distinct types at runtime ever.
