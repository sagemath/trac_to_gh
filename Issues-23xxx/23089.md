That doesn't answer my question.

Let me rephrase my question: there are 3 reasonable choices for the `language_level` option.

(A) Always `language_level=2` *(the current situation)*

(B) Always `language_level=3`

(C) `language_level=2` on Python 2 and `language_level=3` on Python 3

**Why** is (C) better than (A)?

And there is an additional question: why is (C) better than (B)?

I haven't looked at (B) because I didn't want to change the behaviour of Sage on Python 2.

Setting `language_level=3` on Python 3 helped to discover (some) import errors already at compile time and not at runtime. And I assume (haven't tested) that using `language_level=3` could lead to less `unicode` problems than using `language_level=2` and could simplify the way to Sage on Python 3.

Jeroen, you have more experience with Cython, so I assume you can provide more knowledge-based arguments for one or the other.

> Jeroen, you have more experience with Cython, so I assume you can provide more knowledge-based arguments for one or the other.

It's not really a Cython-specific thing, it's a more general philosophy. When writing Python code, you can try to

(A) use Python 2 semantics as much as possible

(B) use Python 3 semantics as much as possible

(C) use Python 2 semantics on Python 2 and Python 3 semantics on Python 3

For plain Python, (A) is not possible in many cases because Python 3 removes a feature (for example: `__cmp__`, string literals interpreted as `bytes`, `dict.iteritems`). With Cython, the sitation for (A) is better because some Python 2 features are supported by Cython regardless of Python version.

For plain Python, (B) is often possible (using `from __future__` imports or packages like `six`).

And (C) is usually where trouble lies (strings interpreted as `bytes`/`unicode` depending on the Python version, different division semantics...).

Based on this, I believe that (C) is the worst option. Of course, this is just a personal opinion...

<div id="comment:10" align="right">Comment 10</div>

I tried to compile sage on Python 2 with `language_level=3`. There are some issues like

```
Unicode objects only support coercion to Py_UNICODE*.
```
which should be easily fixable.
A bigger problem are errors like

```
names = ['A{}'.format(''.join(str(x) for x in sorted(F))) for F in flats]  
                                                     ^

sage/matroids/matroid.pyx:7527:66: local variable 'F' referenced before assignment
```
https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1159

https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1351

If we don't want to switch now, we should at least make the sage code as much level 3 compatible as possible to allow an easier transition later.

I agree in principle. On the other hand, I think this should literally be the last of our Python 3 worries. There is nothing really wrong with the status quo and there are plenty of other things which still need to be fixed for Python 3.

So I suggest to close this ticket as wontfix for now.

I thought we discussed this on sage-devel. Cython knows that `str = unicode` on Python 3 and string literals are `str = unicode` on Python 3, regardless of `language_level`.

Note that using `language_level=3` does turn on `from `__future__` import unicode_literals`. But on Python 3, that doesn't change anything.

The first part of the sentence doesn't specify what they mean by "str", because this doesn't seem to agree with my experience of turning on `language_level=3` (where suddenly string literals were being treated as unicode and breaking whenever passed to an interface that expects `char *`).

Anyways, another reason to do this is that we'll probably want to use other Python 3 features eventually so it would be good to enable.

In Cython code, it's best to think of `bytes`, `str` and `unicode` as three distinct types (that's what Cython does internally). It just happes that `str is bytes` on Python 2 and `str is unicode` on Python 3.

So then, unprefixed string literals are `str` with `language_level=2` (exactly the same as in plain Python), they are `unicode` with `language_level=3` (exactly the same as in plain Python with `from `__future__` import unicode_literals`).

Maybe I did read that paragraph and *it* didn't make sense.

Let me clarify: when Cython compiles Cython code to C, it doesn't yet know if the C code will be compiled as Python 2 and Python 3. So when it sees a `"string"` literal, it doesn't really know what king of string it will be. To solve this, Cython internally really has 3 string types: `bytes`, `str` and `unicode`. Both `bytes` and `unicode` are easy to deal with, since they refer to the same type on Python 2 and Python 3 (*). To deal with `str`, it uses macros like

```
#if PY_MAJOR_VERSION >= 3
  #define PyBaseString_Type            PyUnicode_Type
  #define PyStringObject               PyUnicodeObject
  #define PyString_Type                PyUnicode_Type
  #define PyString_Check               PyUnicode_Check
  #define PyString_CheckExact          PyUnicode_CheckExact
#endif
```

(*) I know that they renamed `unicode` to `str` on Python 3, but that is really a superficial change in the Python language. The C API function names start with `PyUnicode`, and that is what Cython really cares about.

I didn't realize that even when compiling Python 3 sources Cython still defines "unicode" as a built-in, which is surprising--that's part of my confusion.

I was looking at the code myself just now, and I think my confusion with your explanation comes from the fact that you're referring to "three distinct types".  And it's true, that it has the *names* `unicode`, `str`, and `bytes` in all cases.  But that doesn't mean there are three distinct types.

> But that doesn't mean there are three distinct types.

From Cython's point of view, there really are 3 types because Cython doesn't know whether the C code will be compiled as Python 2 or Python 3. It is only after the fact that it "happens" that str maps to bytes or unicode.

But the Cython compiler has 3 classes `BytesNode`, `UnicodeNode` and `StringNode` to deal with the 3 kinds of string constants. And this is where the `from `__future__` import unicode_literals` (which is implied by `language_level=3`) comes in: unprefixed `"string"` literals becomes `UnicodeNode` instead of `StringNode`.

FWIW this is also helpful:

```
    builtin_entries = {

        "type":   ["((PyObject*)&PyType_Type)", py_object_type],

        "bool":   ["((PyObject*)&PyBool_Type)", py_object_type],
        "int":    ["((PyObject*)&PyInt_Type)", py_object_type],
        "long":   ["((PyObject*)&PyLong_Type)", py_object_type],
        "float":  ["((PyObject*)&PyFloat_Type)", py_object_type],
        "complex":["((PyObject*)&PyComplex_Type)", py_object_type],

        "bytes":  ["((PyObject*)&PyBytes_Type)", py_object_type],
        "bytearray":   ["((PyObject*)&PyByteArray_Type)", py_object_type],
        "str":    ["((PyObject*)&PyString_Type)", py_object_type],
        "unicode":["((PyObject*)&PyUnicode_Type)", py_object_type],
        ...
```

This is how it determines certain built-in names.  Incidentally Python 2 has `#define PyBytes_Type PyString_Type` in its headers, but Python 3 does not have `#define PyString_Type PyUnicode_Type` which is why Cython has to include that explicitly.

I disagree with your read on the situation.  The parser/compiler may have three Node types which makes sense, but there aren't three distinct types at runtime ever.
