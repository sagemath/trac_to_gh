<a id='comment:6'></a>That doesn't answer my question.

Let me rephrase my question: there are 3 reasonable choices for the `language_level` option.

(A) Always `language_level=2` *(the current situation)*

(B) Always `language_level=3`

(C) `language_level=2` on Python 2 and `language_level=3` on Python 3

**Why** is (C) better than (A)?

And there is an additional question: why is (C) better than (B)?

Jeroen, you have more experience with Cython, so I assume you can provide more knowledge-based arguments for one or the other.

It's not really a Cython-specific thing, it's a more general philosophy. When writing Python code, you can try to

(A) use Python 2 semantics as much as possible

(B) use Python 3 semantics as much as possible

(C) use Python 2 semantics on Python 2 and Python 3 semantics on Python 3

For plain Python, (A) is not possible in many cases because Python 3 removes a feature (for example: `__cmp__`, string literals interpreted as `bytes`, `dict.iteritems`). With Cython, the sitation for (A) is better because some Python 2 features are supported by Cython regardless of Python version.

For plain Python, (B) is often possible (using `from __future__` imports or packages like `six`).

And (C) is usually where trouble lies (strings interpreted as `bytes`/`unicode` depending on the Python version, different division semantics...).

Based on this, I believe that (C) is the worst option. Of course, this is just a personal opinion...

<a id='comment:10'></a>I tried to compile sage on Python 2 with `language_level=3`. There are some issues like

```

```
which should be easily fixable.
A bigger problem are errors like

```
names = ['A{}'.format(''.join(str(x) for x in sorted(F))) for F in flats]  
                                                     ^

```

https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1351

If we don't want to switch now, we should at least make the sage code as much level 3 compatible as possible to allow an easier transition later.

I agree in principle. On the other hand, I think this should literally be the last of our Python 3 worries. There is nothing really wrong with the status quo and there are plenty of other things which still need to be fixed for Python 3.

So I suggest to close this ticket as wontfix for now.

It's terribly confusing when trying to port to Python 3 if you have Python 2/3 straddling pure Python code that behaves like Python 2 on Python 2 and like Python 3 on Python 3, but then totally different semantics when you cross over into Cython land.


I would argue that the confusion is more in the Python land than in the Cython land.

You are saying that we should make the code behave *more different* in Python 2 and Python 3 and that will make our life easier?  I say it's a bad thing and we should be happy that Cython allows us to worry less about Python 2/3 compatibility.

I thought we discussed this on sage-devel. Cython knows that `str = unicode` on Python 3 and string literals are `str = unicode` on Python 3, regardless of `language_level`.

Note that using `language_level=3` does turn on `from __future__ import unicode_literals`. But on Python 3, that doesn't change anything.

The first part of the sentence doesn't specify what they mean by "str", because this doesn't seem to agree with my experience of turning on `language_level=3` (where suddenly string literals were being treated as unicode and breaking whenever passed to an interface that expects `char *`).

Anyways, another reason to do this is that we'll probably want to use other Python 3 features eventually so it would be good to enable.

In Cython code, it's best to think of `bytes`, `str` and `unicode` as three distinct types (that's what Cython does internally). It just happes that `str is bytes` on Python 2 and `str is unicode` on Python 3.

So then, unprefixed string literals are `str` with `language_level=2` (exactly the same as in plain Python), they are `unicode` with `language_level=3` (exactly the same as in plain Python with `from __future__ import unicode_literals`).

From Cython's point of view, there really are 3 types because Cython doesn't know whether the C code will be compiled as Python 2 or Python 3. It is only after the fact that it "happens" that str maps to bytes or unicode.

But the Cython compiler has 3 classes `BytesNode`, `UnicodeNode` and `StringNode` to deal with the 3 kinds of string constants. And this is where the `from __future__ import unicode_literals` (which is implied by `language_level=3`) comes in: unprefixed `"string"` literals becomes `UnicodeNode` instead of `StringNode`.
