<a id='comment:6'></a>1. Why did you change

```
if self._ncols == 0
```
to

```
if not self._ncols
```

I find `self._ncols == 0` clearer to understand: it checks for a matrix with zero colomns.

2. It is wrong to write `sage.matrix.matrix_space.MatrixSpace` without importing it. It might work by accident, but it's not good. Either you explicitly `import sage.matrix.matrix_space` or you do something like `from sage.matrix.matrix_space import MatrixSpace` and then use `MatrixSpace`.

3. Same comment for `sage.matrix.constructor`.

4. Same comment for `sage.rings.power_series_ring` in `src/sage/rings/power_series_ring_element.pyx`
