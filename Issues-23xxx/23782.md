In 'SageMath version 8.1.beta0, Release Date: 2017-07-29' I have the following behaviour, (at least with FriCAS 1.2.5)

```
def elementary(k, j):
    """
    sage: f = fricas.guessRat([elementary(5,j) for j in range(15)])[0]; f

                                 11520

    sage: print fricas.get(f._name)

    """
    return stirling_number1(j+1, j+1-k)
```
Note the bad indentation in the second line and the weird quotation mark in the third.

Fixing #22525 would probably fix this, too.

commit 5082c96e79a15b34779a0c9b0b43d652cdade31c
Author: Simon King <simon.king@uni-jena.de>
Date:   Tue Mar 14 14:53:36 2017 +0100

    Use single underscore _repr_ in interfaces, add more documentation concerning eval and get
```
introduced this change in #22501:

```
+    def _repr_(self):
+        """
+        Default implementation of a helper method for string representation.
...
+        """
+        P = self.parent()
+        try:
+            if self._get_using_file:

+        except AttributeError:
+            return self.parent().get(self._name).strip()
```

I think the strip should go away.  The other solution is to override it in `fricas.py`, but I really cannot think of a situation where we really want the `strip`.  Output will often be ascii-art in interfaces, and this is a default implementation.

I agree that this is a sensible possibility, but I'm not completely sure.

Can you think of any surprising results with rstrip?
