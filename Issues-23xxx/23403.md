So the 0 Schubert polynomial is initialized to an empty list, which behaves differently from, e.g., Schur functions. Because of this, the code tries to get the next pointer starting from a null pointer, resulting in a crash within Symmetrica in a way that is not done within a `sig_on`/`sig_off` block. I also fix up some other corner cases.

Thanks Frédéric. I'm pushing an improved doc.

However, I think the new behavior, raising errors when there are not enough variables, is wrong. The Schubert polynomial ring is in infinitely many variables by definition; a polynomial isn't "missing" a variable; it just happens to be degree-0 with respect to it.

```
sage: a = X([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: a.divided_difference(4)
```
This should yield 0, not an exception!

ValueError: a must be a Schubert polynomial over ZZ or QQ

This is probably a BS restriction, and we should be using Symmetrica on monomials rather than on the whole polynomial.

I'm getting more and more confused the longer I stare at the Schubert code. What exactly does the following method (in libs/symmetrica/sb.pxi) do?

    Returns the result of applying the divided difference operator
    $\delta_i$ to $a$ where $a$ is either a permutation or a

I'm pretty sure there is at least one typo in the docstring.

I have rewritten `divided_difference` natively in Sage. The resulting function is significantly faster (around factor 2 on the examples I have tried, which involve Schubert polynomials X(pi) with pi \in S_3, S_4, S_5) and free of the #23423 issue. There is more potential for optimization: the whole thing could be rewritten in Cython (not by me), and the `remove_extra_fixed_points` helper method on the `Permutation` class could be made into a standalone function that deals with lists (rather than permutations).

In the current commit, for the sake of reviewing, both the new and the old method can be used (the default is the new one; get the old one by setting the optional `newm` variable to `False`). I guess we'll want to get rid of the old one before merging.
