Here is what the code gives:

```
sage: a = X([3,2,1])
sage: a.expand()
x0^2*x1
sage: for w in Permutations(3):
....:     if not w.reduced_word():
....:         continue
....:     print w.reduced_word(),
....:     print a.divided_difference(w).expand()
[2] x0^2
[1] x0*x1
[1, 2] x0
[2, 1] x0 + x1
[2, 1, 2] 1
```
You can tell that `i` acts on the `i`-th variable (although there is a 1-based to 0-based shift needed), and there does not seem to be any signs involved.

Thanks Frédéric. I'm pushing an improved doc.

However, I think the new behavior, raising errors when there are not enough variables, is wrong. The Schubert polynomial ring is in infinitely many variables by definition; a polynomial isn't "missing" a variable; it just happens to be degree-0 with respect to it.

```
sage: a = X([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: a.divided_difference(4)
```
This should yield 0, not an exception!

That's not new behavior. The only change in behavior is for 0, which is a special case IMO. There is some reason to consider this an error by considering this as the restriction to a finite number of variables.

OK, I'm just seeing that the method plainly doesn't work over non-ZZ/QQ base rings. At least it's being honest about it:

```
ValueError: a must be a Schubert polynomial over ZZ or QQ
```
This is probably a BS restriction, and we should be using Symmetrica on monomials rather than on the whole polynomial.

I'm getting more and more confused the longer I stare at the Schubert code. What exactly does the following method (in libs/symmetrica/sb.pxi) do?

```
def divdiff_perm_schubert_symmetrica(perm, a):
    r"""
    Returns the result of applying the divided difference operator
    $\delta_i$ to $a$ where $a$ is either a permutation or a
    Schubert polynomial over QQ.
```
I'm pretty sure there is at least one typo in the docstring.

I have rewritten `divided_difference` natively in Sage. The resulting function is significantly faster (around factor 2 on the examples I have tried, which involve Schubert polynomials X(pi) with pi \in S_3, S_4, S_5) and free of the #23423 issue. There is more potential for optimization: the whole thing could be rewritten in Cython (not by me), and the `remove_extra_fixed_points` helper method on the `Permutation` class could be made into a standalone function that deals with lists (rather than permutations).

In the current commit, for the sake of reviewing, both the new and the old method can be used (the default is the new one; get the old one by setting the optional `newm` variable to `False`). I guess we'll want to get rid of the old one before merging.

This is a great improvement and is faster on all of the examples I tested (including some relatively large permutations). However, it must go on another ticket as this ticket is about fixing the crash in symmetrica, which is independent of the divided difference functionality. I guess it is somewhat my fault for starting this. Yet, I will revert all of the other little changes if that is what it takes for us to focus on the problem of this ticket. I will review the followup tickets in exchange.

I reverted this branch to `1aaca0f` as that is still in the general realm of the ticket, but I am considering a full rewrite. I put your current rewrite on the branch

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (with 8.1.beta0)

The segfault is definitely the "correct" failure, but for some reason it seems Python is attempting to handle the error. *shrugs*
