Okay, I've traced the problem down to the fact that there might be no monomials in the Schubert polynomial. Yet it is still a pointer to a non-`NULL` Schubert polynomial, so the code does not translate it to `0`.

Here is what the code gives:

```
sage: a = X([3,2,1])
sage: a.expand()
x0^2*x1
sage: for w in Permutations(3):
....:     if not w.reduced_word():
....:         continue
....:     print w.reduced_word(),
....:     print a.divided_difference(w).expand()
[2] x0^2
[1] x0*x1
[1, 2] x0
[2, 1] x0 + x1
[2, 1, 2] 1
```
You can tell that `i` acts on the `i`-th variable (although there is a 1-based to 0-based shift needed), and there does not seem to be any signs involved.

Thanks Frédéric. I'm pushing an improved doc.

However, I think the new behavior, raising errors when there are not enough variables, is wrong. The Schubert polynomial ring is in infinitely many variables by definition; a polynomial isn't "missing" a variable; it just happens to be degree-0 with respect to it.

```
sage: a = X([1,2,3,4,5])
sage: a.divided_difference(4)
```
This should yield 0, not an exception!

The only change in behavior is for 0, which is a special case IMO. There is some reason to consider this an error by considering this as the restriction to a finite number of variables. So there is some room for debate, and as such, it should go on another ticket (there's enough \"ticket creep\" already).\n\nI do not disagree with you that it is more natural for it to be 0, but you also need the same behavior to happen for permutation input.

That's not new behavior. The only change in behavior is for 0, which is a special case IMO. There is some reason to consider this an error by considering this as the restriction to a finite number of variables. So there is some room for debate, and as such, it should go on another ticket (there's enough "ticket creep" already).

```
ValueError: a must be a Schubert polynomial over ZZ or QQ
```
This is probably a BS restriction, and we should be using Symmetrica on monomials rather than on the whole polynomial.

I'm getting more and more confused the longer I stare at the Schubert code. What exactly does the following method (in libs/symmetrica/sb.pxi) do?

```
def divdiff_perm_schubert_symmetrica(perm, a):
    r"""
    Returns the result of applying the divided difference operator
    $\delta_i$ to $a$ where $a$ is either a permutation or a
    Schubert polynomial over QQ.
```
I'm pretty sure there is at least one typo in the docstring.

I have rewritten `divided_difference` natively in Sage. The resulting function is significantly faster (around factor 2 on the examples I have tried, which involve Schubert polynomials X(pi) with pi \in S_3, S_4, S_5) and free of the #23423 issue. There is more potential for optimization: the whole thing could be rewritten in Cython (not by me), and the `remove_extra_fixed_points` helper method on the `Permutation` class could be made into a standalone function that deals with lists (rather than permutations).

In the current commit, for the sake of reviewing, both the new and the old method can be used (the default is the new one; get the old one by setting the optional `newm` variable to `False`). I guess we'll want to get rid of the old one before merging.

Yes, the crash occurs because symmetrica returns an empty-list object to represent `0` from the data type but the interpreter is expecting a null pointer for `0` (as is the case for, e.g., Schur functions). The main change is in `symmetrica.pxi`. I also made the extra change in `sb.pxi` to further protect against bad-input that leads to either grossly wrong results or a crash. All other changes are tangential.

Let me guess, 100789 means 10th July 1989?

That said, the English-German hodgepodge has probably not been up to standards even by the 80s standards...

Yes (other than the number that changes every time).

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (with 8.1.beta0)

The segfault is definitely the "correct" failure, but for some reason it seems Python is attempting to handle the error. *shrugs*
