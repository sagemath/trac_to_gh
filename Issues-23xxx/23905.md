`Homset._generic_convert_map` uses `self._element_constructor`.

Ideally, we would get rid of `_generic_convert_map` completely.

<a id='comment:9'></a>**Trivial conversion**:

*Before*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 489 ns per loop
```

*After*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 95.4 ns per loop
```

**Non-trivial conversion**:

*Before*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 2.55 µs per loop
```

*After*:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 3.4 µs per loop

<a id='comment:10'></a>Interestingly, I traced the speed difference of the "non-trivial conversion" above to the call

```
R = parent(x)
```

Apparently, asking for the parent of non-numeric types is very slow.

<a id='comment:12'></a>My timings.

Before

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 393 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 1.85 µs per loop
```
Just #23905

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 47.7 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 2.35 µs per loop
```
Both #23905 and #23912:

```
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = H.identity(); timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=100000)
20 loops, best of 100000: 47.7 ns per loop
sage: H = End(FreeGroup('x,y')); f = lambda x:x; timeit('H(f)', number=20, repeat=10000)
20 loops, best of 10000: 1.65 µs per loop
```

So LGTM. I'm putting #23912 as a dependency just because I feel we should not merge this without #23912 to avoid the speed regression.
