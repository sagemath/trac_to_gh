The Sage function .round() cannot be called on an Integer. This can be annoying. For example, 

```
sage: 7.round() 
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' object has no attribute 'round'
```
but

```
sage: 7.0.round() 
7
```

Keywords: round(), Integer, sd87

<a id='comment:1'></a>To make things even more confusing, the global `round` function does allow an integer input, but the output is not a Sage integer!

```
sage: u = round(7); u
7.0
sage: u.parent()
Real Double Field
```
According to the docstring for this function, "If no precision is specified this just calls the element's `.round()` method." This means that addressing the originally reported problem, by adding a `.round()` method to Sage integers which acts as the identity map, would fix this too.
