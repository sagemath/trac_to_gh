If the Python function `makedirs` is used to achieve the effect of `mkdir -p`, one needs to distinguish two situations: Directory already exists; directory does not exist and cannot be created.

Current code in `sage_setup` does not raise an error in the latter situation. Noticed while working on #21469 (VPATH).
