Wondering about the test about arrow. From the file

```
        Dashed arrows should have solid arrowheads,
        :trac:`12852`. This test saves the plot of a dashed arrow to
        an EPS file. Within the EPS file, ``stroke`` will be called
        twice: once to draw the line, and again to draw the
        arrowhead. We check that both calls do not occur while the
        dashed line style is enabled::
            sage: a = arrow((0,0), (1,1), linestyle='dashed')
            sage: filename = tmp_filename(ext='.eps')
            sage: a.save(filename=filename)
            sage: with open(filename, 'r') as f:
            ....:     contents = f.read().replace('\n', ' ')
            sage: two_stroke_pattern = r'setdash.*stroke.*stroke.*setdash'
            sage: import re
            sage: two_stroke_re = re.compile(two_stroke_pattern)
            sage: two_stroke_re.search(contents) is None
            True
```
When I look at the result of the last one I get

```
sage: two_stroke_re.search(contents)
<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x7f0420011bf8>
```
Obviously not `none` but we don't know from that if what is being tested failed or not. For the other doctest, it is a case of input being integer when the interface request a "real" type. Replacing a `(0,0,0)` by `(0.0,0.0,0.0)` does indeed fix the test.

Not sure about what `two_stroke_re.search(contents)` returns, but I think the doctest actually failed. If I replace `two_stroke_re.search(contents) is None` with `two_stroke_re.search(contents) is not None` I get `True`. If you look at the generated `.eps` file the arrow is drawn with dashed lines. So I think the Sage patch from ticket #12852 is not working. I don't have matplotlib-2.1.0, 2.0.2 was used.

It seems that line 440 in `src/sage/plot/arrow.py`

```
pe2 = ConditionalStroke(CheckNthSubPath(p, 1), [pe.Stroke(linestyle="solid")])
```
is doing nothing. In particular `pe.Stroke()` is ignoring `linestyle="solid"`. This is the piece that insures the head of the arrow is filled/solid. With `matplotlib-1.5.3` if I replace `linestyle="solid"` with `linestyle="junk"` I get `ValueError: Unrecognized linestyle: junk` when saving the `.eps`

I get no error when doing the same with `matplotlib-2.0.2` and the head of the arrow is drawn with `linestyle="dashed"`.

Apparently a not so obvious API change. The following should work for `>= 1.5.3`. The `.eps` looks (needs to be confirmed!) OK.

The doctest `./sage -t --long src/sage/plot/arrow.py` does pass on vanilla Sage with the above changes with `matplotlib-1.5.3`. However on sage-on-gentoo with `matplotlib-2.0.2` the generated `.eps` looks OK but the test still fails?

and perhaps some comments. This also works with version `1.5.3`

Is it a latest trend, include qhull everywhere (IIRC, scipy also builds its own copy...)? :-)

here is the config summary:

```
    REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES AND EXTENSIONS
                     numpy: yes [version 1.13.3]
                       six: yes [using six version 1.11.0]
                  dateutil: yes [using dateutil version 2.5.3]
    backports.functools_lru_cache: yes [backports.functools_lru_cache was not
                            found. It is required forPython versions prior to
                            3.2]
              subprocess32: yes [subprocess32 was not found. It used  for Python
                            versions prior to 3.2 to improves functionality on
                            Linux and OSX]
                      pytz: yes [using pytz version 2016.4]
                    cycler: yes [using cycler version 0.10.0]
                   tornado: yes [using tornado version 4.3]
                 pyparsing: yes [using pyparsing version 2.1.5]
                    libagg: yes [pkg-config information for 'libagg' could not
                            be found. Using local copy.]
                  freetype: yes [version 2.6.3]
                       png: yes [version 1.6.29]
                     qhull: yes [Using system Qhull (version unknown, no pkg-
                            config info)]
```

by the way, I just installed a systemwide qhull (on gentoo), and the build works --- although that's not what we want here I suppose...

Yes, as I was mentioning there will need dependencies added.

To go back to qhull, the fact that it works once you install it system wide probably point to a bug in matplotlib's build system. Definitely more stuff to look at.

Yes, I believe this is what I did to get rid of the the `label` warnings. And yes something is really wrong inside `contour_plot.py`. There is stuff there not consistent with even `matplotlib-1.5.1`, which someone needs to fix.

I'm curious, even though I think the `set_linestyle` needs to be addressed, I've never gotten a warning about it's use, that is with vanilla Sage.

There are certainly inconsistencies between vanilla and gentoo but I am not completely sure why yet.

I think I got the `set_linestyle` that triggered the warnings but there are other all over the place. And I am not sure if there is still a function for that particular object or if it isn't tested. I added a `linestyle` argument to particular test and it didn't result in a warning so some objects haven't deprecated it yet. 

I am puzzled by the stuff about axes being re-used. Re-used from where? I guess even if it isn't re-used it is about it needing some label. I have a feeling that it is MPL's fault rather than sage's fault.

The next biggie is `delaunay`. I may well not have it under control until Monday (cross finger I can do something about it).

This is all very contorted (my opinion). Let's hope that the `fix` doesn't just cover up the real issue. But from Sage

```
sage: fig = Graphics().matplotlib()
sage: sp = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1, label='axis1')
sage: sp
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot object at 0x7f1648115110>
```
So it would seem that `add_subplot` may call `add_axes` which then may require the `label`?

It wasn't good enough in #17618, however there is one new option that may improve things. I will have to dig the old code of #17618 to do some experiments.

Ha, forgotten the scipy stuff is "nearest neighbor", the stuff from delaunay is "natural neighbor" and they are definitely different things.

All that's available has already been tried during the upgrade to MPL 1.4.

Is it this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_neighbor_interpolation ?

Surely Sage has more than one implementation of !Voronoi/Delaunay stuff...

Yes, not clear. I was referring to the Sage documentation. In `list_plot3d.py` there is

```
    OPTIONAL KEYWORDS:

    - ``interpolation_type`` - 'linear', 'nn' (natural neighbor), 'spline'
```
and

```
      the triangulation. These points, the natural neighbors, are the ones 
      the interpolation point would connect to if inserted into the 
      triangulation.
```
and lastly

```
      When v is a matrix the default is to use linear interpolation, when
      v is a list of points the default is nearest neighbor.

spline are looking equally bad before and after the upgrade of MPL (since it is scipy based no surprise). Interestingly #17618 doesn't show what the spline result looks like so it is probably not new.

The linear results are different between MPL 1.5.3 and 2.1.0. If anything 2.1.0 looks more refined.

So the code is basically

```
from sage.stats.distributions.discrete_gaussian_lattice import DiscreteGaussianDistributionLatticeSampler
D = DiscreteGaussianDistributionLatticeSampler(identity_matrix(2), 3.0)
S = [D() for _ in range(2^12)]
l = [vector(v.list() + [S.count(v)]) for v in set(S)]
%timeit P = list_plot3d(l, interpolation_type='linear', texture="automatic", point_list=True)
list_plot3d(l, interpolation_type='spline', texture="automatic", point_list=True)
```
with various replacement for interpolation type.

Note the variation in `z` across all examples.

MPL-1.5.3, linear

```
The slowest run took 20.64 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100 loops, best of 3: 4.91 ms per loop
```

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23696/MPL153-linear.png)

MPL-1.5.3, natural neighbor (nn)

```
100 loops, best of 3: 5.8 ms per loop
```

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23696/MPL153-nn.png)

MPL-2.1.0, linear

```
The slowest run took 22.77 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100 loops, best of 3: 4.96 ms per loop
```

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23696/MPL210-linear.png)

MPL-2.1.0, CloughTocher (new)

```
100 loops, best of 3: 4.6 ms per loop
```

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23696/MPL210-clough.png)

I'd say MPL-2.1.0 linear looks much better than 1.5.3 and could be the new default. It is definitely smoother. We could also replace "natural neighbor" with "CloughTocher" in the selection. It is an interesting one. As the fastest in the lot and not depending on some caching (unlike linear) it is a viable default in my opinion.

@ steve I just tested your example with my branch. in that case your "nn" picture is quite close to the linear from MPL 2.1.0. And the cubic picture is very similar to what I get for "clough". But I imagine cubic is much slower. Here are my timings

```
sage: v = [[len(factor(n*m)) for n in [1..15]] for m in [1..15]]
sage: %timeit NT=list_plot3d(v, interpolation_type='linear')
The slowest run took 325.09 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 83.4 ¬µs per loop
sage: %timeit NT=list_plot3d(v, interpolation_type='clough')
100 loops, best of 3: 3.73 ms per loop
```
In this particular case linear is blazingly fast so may be cubic has a reasonable runtime.

`@`fran√ßois, back to this.

My tests here indicate that `CloughTocher2DInterpolator` with your changes is roughly 20 times faster that `CubicTriInterpolator`. There are some subtle differences in the pictures so they are not exactly the same. A disadvantage of using `CubicTriInterpolator`
is the `DeprecationWarning` mentioned above:

`interpolation_type='nn'` does use `cubics`.
If I change `axis=3` to `axis=2` in the 3 offending lines in `matplotlib/tri/triinterpolate.py` then the warnings disappear. I think there may be a mistake in the `matplotlib` code. There is this [matplotlib pull](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8610) that references this [commit](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/8610/commits/5cea9ce4d4ee936477bfb0bfd3462ba113749b). But I'm not sure the changes were complete enough.

Another issue is the display of LaTeX in axes labels or text graphic objects; consider for instance

```
sage: text(r"$\sin(x^2) + \int_0^\pi \sqrt{x}\mathrm{d} x$", (1,1), fontsize=20)
```
With MPL-2.1.0, the output is

![](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/files/ticket23696/latex_display_MPL-2.1.0.png)

which is ugly, compared to what we have in Sage 8.1:

Also the size of the picture is different.

from matplotlib import rc

For instance compare the attached `plot-11.png` (generated with MPL-2.1.0) with that at http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/plotting/sage/plot/plot.html

So when I do

```
sage: G = plot(cos(x), (x, -5, 5), thickness=5, color='green', title='A plot')
sage: P = polygon([[1,2], [5,6], [5,0]], color='red')
sage: Q = polygon([(-x,y) for x,y in P[0]], color='blue')
sage: H = G + P + Q
sage: H
```
I get a `.png` that has very good quality but the size of the file containing the `.png` is about 45% larger than `plot-11.png`. So there are differences somewhere? I wonder what is generating the `.png` file?

No, I get the error message:

```
sage: from matplotlib import rc
sage: rc('text', usetex='True')
sage: text(r"$\sin(x^2) + \int_0^\pi \sqrt{x}\mathrm{d} x$", (1,1), fontsize=20)

  RichReprWarning,

```
I guess this requires the package `dvipng` to be installed on my system (it is not).

Indeed, this generates a good quality figure, contrary to what happens for the same commands when building the doc with Sphinx. 

Besides, the resolution of the png is 630x464, while for the same plot, it is 784x575 in Sage 8.1.

Thanks for the change, but it does not work: after rebuilding everything from scratch, the default font is still dejavusans. 

By the way, I confirm that the low quality of all figures in the reference manual is due to this ticket and not to any other change introduced in Sage 8.2.beta0 (I mean, it is fine with 8.2.beta0 alone).

```

fn = tmp_filename(ext=".png")
g = plot(sin(x^2), (x, 0, 4))

```
you get a low quality figure, while if you do the same thing with Sage 8.1, you get a nice figure.

By the way, this explains why 3D plots are also affected, because `plot.plot()` in `sphinx_plot` code transforms them into a 2D figure, which is then processed by `mpimg` and `plt`.

> The `sphinx_plot` code is clearly the culprit

In `sphinx_plot` code, changing 

```
        plt.imshow(img)
```
to 

```
        plt.imshow(img, interpolation='spline16')
```
gives a much better result, still on small size as compare to the previous version though.

The doc from `plt.imshow?` says:

```
interpolation : string, optional, default: None
   Acceptable values are 'none', 'nearest', 'bilinear', 'bicubic',
   'spline16', 'spline36', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite', 'kaiser',
   'quadric', 'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell', 'sinc',
   'lanczos'

   If interpolation is None, default to rc image.interpolation. See
   also the filternorm and filterrad parameters. If interpolation is
   'none', then no interpolation is performed on the Agg, ps and pdf
   backends. Other backends will fall back to 'nearest'.
```
So maybe something around rc `image.interpolation` should be worked out.

There is a typo in what I suggested. Not sure what I did, given the typo, to make the font selection work. The recent commit should change
 

```
config.set('rc_options', 'mathtext.fontsel', 'cm')
```

to

```
config.set('rc_options', 'mathtext.fontset', 'cm')
```

`fontsel -> fontset`

But even with the change, I'm unable to get `matplotlib` to recognize the font change. Something is wrong.

Sage being *mathematics* software, we should set `cm` as the default font, whatever upstream thinks. Mathematical formulas with `dejavusans` look really ugly and `cm` has the big advantage of making labels/legends of figures for a scientific paper/textbook coincide with those of the main text.

+1; so for this one, we should keep MPL-2.1.0 defaults.

Fonts are bigger in MPL 1.5.3! They are smaller in 2.1.0. But using "classic" should take care of that too.

This may be true for 3D plots (which are not produced by matplotplib, by the way), but not for 2D plots generated by matplotlib: they all end up in a `png` file and all viewers will display this `png` figure in a unique way, whatever backend you are using (console, Jupyter, sagenb, CoCalc, SageMathCell, ...)

I think the problem may well be with `bezier_path`. This generates an arc

```
sage: a = arc((0,0),2,1,0,(pi/5,pi/2+pi/12))
sage: a
```
However this generates an ellipse

```
sage: b=a[0].bezier_path()
sage: b
```
and

```
sage: a[0]
Arc with center (0.0,0.0) radii (2.0,1.0) angle 0.0 inside the sector (0.628318530718,1.83259571459)

Replying to [@kiwifb](#comment%3A159):
> Could you show the original, so it is clear that the graph was incorrect?

How to show this? The original will appear almost identical but the limits will be different. Let's try a calculation from Sage. With mpl-1.5.3 and the old code we get

```
sage: b[0]
Bezier path from (1.6180339887498949, 0.58778525229247314) to (-0.51763809020504215, 0.9659258262890682)
```

With the revised code using mpl-2.1.0 we get

```
sage: b[0]
Bezier path from (1.1338305413635981, 0.82377610785199551) to (-0.26557635219221642, 0.99114443967015675)
```

From the above example, the inputs, `theta1` and `theta2` are:

```
sage: theta1 = float(pi)/5; theta1
0.6283185307179586
sage: theta2 = float(pi)/2+float(pi)/12; theta2
1.832595714594046
```

Then using mpl-1.5.3 `b[0]` results, the angles are

```
sage: theta1 = arctan(0.58778525229247314/1.6180339887498949); theta1
0.3484485055191126
theta2 = arctan(0.9659258262890682/-0.51763809020504215) + float(pi); theta2
2.0627485381367054
```
which are incorrect.

Now using mpl-2.1.0 `b[0]` results, the angles are

```
sage: theta1 = arctan(0.82377610785199551/1.1338305413635981); theta1
0.6283185307179587
sage: theta2 = arctan(0.99114443967015675/-0.26557635219221642) + float(pi); theta2
1.8325957145940461
```
which are correct, to machine accuracy.

Thanks for the new commits. I agree that it becomes rather urgent to upgrade to Matplotlib 2.1.0. However, 
somewhat independently of the `classic` style, there remains the `computer modern` font issue. As suggested by Steve in [comment:129](#comment%3A129), it suffices to change one line (line 274) in the file
`local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc`, namely change

```
mathtext.fontset : dejavusans # Should be 'dejavusans' (default),
```
to

```
mathtext.fontset : cm # Should be 'dejavusans' (default),
```
I guess this is feasible in the post-install phase, isn't it?

Without this, many users who are taking care of plots with nice labels, will be upset. Note that the change of the default to `dejavusans` generated some debate in the Matplotlib community, see e.g. https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5860/ and https://husky.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/revert-matplotlib-2-0-mathtext-default-font-style-to-computer-modern/ .

No they are present, I was looking at a single commit rather than the branch. 

What did it is the change to "classic style". This is annoying, the dashing stuff depends on the style. That makes it a fragile test in my book. I'd like to revisit it a little bit and document what's going on there a bit better.

The problem is that `matplotlib` has its own copy of `qhull` but will happily use an already installed one. But the current spkg doesn't install library with names that `matplotlib` knows about. It detects `qhull` presence by headers and then fails to build because it cannot link. It is possible the issue with `scipy` is similar as `scipy` also ships its own `qhull`.

Thank you Fr√©d√©ric!
The 3D plots in the doc are now of good quality; however they are a little bit too small, which makes the axis labels difficult to read. To recover the same size as in Sage 8.1, it suffices to set some parameters in `sphinx_plot`.

I think we need a follow-up ticket for the following:

It seems that we need `sdh_cmake` in addition to `sdh_configure` etc we already have in
`src/bin/sage-dist-helpers`. This would make `spkg-install` scripts where `cmake` is used more uniform and less verbose.

And `spkg-install` ought to use already available `sdh_*` things, too.
E.g. after `cmake` call one would only need something like

```
sdh_make
sdh_make_install
```

no, it happens just once; while I test `src/sage/plot` I get just one error. At the Sage prompt I get

```
sage: import pylab as plt
sage: t = plt.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
sage: s = sin(2*pi*t)
sage: P = plt.plot(t, s)
_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL.
```

It's some kind of initialisation error: if I re-run the last line then no 2nd error message is shown.

Note that it is indeed similar to this:

>This is similar to stuff solved by this patch [https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/sagemath.git/tree/debian/patches/u1-fix-dont-require-DISPLAY.patch](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/debian-science/packages/sagemath.git/tree/debian/patches/u1-fix-dont-require-DISPLAY.patch) in debian and I think there was ticket on trac about `DISPLAY` recently.

If I run (in a fresh Sage session)

```
sage: import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')
sage: import pylab as plt
sage: t = plt.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)
sage: s = sin(2*pi*t)
sage: P = plt.plot(t, s)
```
I see no error message.

This could be a clang-only issue, I don't know.

It comes somewhere from the dark depths of matplotlib, this error message.
Perhaps just add 

```
import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')
``` 
right before this doctest and be done with?

In case, on OSX the default backend is also `TkAgg`.

IMHO the right place to set it to `Agg` is in the testsuite settings.
Then no doctstring patches would be needed (there patches are not very useful as far
as documentation is concerned, as normally speaking one does not want `Agg`).

You should read the whole section

```
Ensure that certain modules are not loaded on startup.
EXAMPLES::
    sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules
    False
    sage: 'pyparsing' in sys.modules
    False
    sage: 'sage.libs.gap.libgap' in sys.modules
    False
Check that IPython is not imported at startup (:trac:`18726`). It is
imported by the doctest framework, so the simple test like above would
not work. Instead, we test this by starting a new Python process::
    sage: from sage.tests.cmdline import test_executable
    sage: cmd = "from sage.all import *\nprint('IPython' in sys.modules)\n"
    sage: print(test_executable(["sage", "--python"], cmd)[0])  # long time
    False
```
basically we check that numpy and pyparsing are not imported at startup because it slows down the startup process considerably. Because of the manipulation of the last commit the tests would need to be made similar to the one for ipython. 

I am feeling like I am playing a game of "whack a mole". I may abandon the most general way to just care for the particular as it is clearly less exhausting.

In a Sage console, I indeed get a blank line for the same command:

```
sage: from sage.tests.cmdline import test_executable
sage: cmd = "print('numpy' in sys.modules)\n"
sage: print(test_executable(["sage", "-c"], cmd)[0])

sage: test_executable(["sage", "-c"], cmd)
('', '', 0)
```
while I do have:

```
sage: 'numpy' in sys.modules
False
```
In the Linux terminal, `./sage -c "print('numpy' in sys.modules)"` returns `False`.
