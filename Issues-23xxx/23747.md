I propose to rename `build` to `sage-distro` and `src` to `sagelib` (cf. #21507). This is to clarify the purpose of these directories.

Too many things are called `src` and `build`, even more with #21469 (VPATH), it's getting confusing.

I'm hoping git is smart enough to handle such renames when we merge tickets, but I am not sure.
