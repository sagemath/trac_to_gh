Keywords: sd87

Add various methods to polynomial_padic.py for invariant computations and Monge reduction and update factor() to use OMTree from #12561 for factoring polynomials over p-adic extensions.

In all, this makes large changes to factor() and adds methods:
- is_eisenstein
- normalized (For use in factoring)
- omtree
- ramification_polynomial
- ramification_polygon
- ramification_polygon_with_colinear_points (used for residual polynomials)
- hasse_herbrand (Evaluate n times Hasse-Herbrand at integers)
- residual_polynomials (of the ramification polygon)
- residual_polynomial_of_component (Monge's S_m)
- has_residual_polynomial_class (Test whether another polynomial is in the same invariant class)
- monge_reduce

Factoring over unramified extension does not work currently (See #23510).  The following doctest shows this.

We run into `R.fraction_field() is self` occurring in `_coerce_map_from_(self, R)` in padic_extension_generic.pyc when we attempt to `change_ring()` our polynomial in `_factor_non_monic()` to increase precision cap. 

```
R.<c> = Zq(125, prec = 500)
Rz.<z>=R[]
g = 25*z^15 + 5
Fg = g.factor()
```
