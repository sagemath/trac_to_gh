This is a follow-up to #22252 which was incomplete.

In Debian we have a tool `dh_sphinxdoc` that checks the generated documentation for internal consistency and it [found some issues](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=866166) that are fixed by the following commits.

It's a minor issue with search-snippet display but should be fixed for 8.0.
