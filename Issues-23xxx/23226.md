From looking at the patchbot log:

```
File "/home/chapoton/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/categories/homset.py", line 1035, in __cmp__
 else: return cmp(self._codomain, other._codomain)
File "/home/chapoton/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/schemes/generic/ambient_space.py", line 83, in __cmp__
```
So it might be fixed by #23239. Although, I think it also makes sense to remove the `__cmp__` from `schemes/generic/ambient_space.py` as it is not something we want to require any more.
