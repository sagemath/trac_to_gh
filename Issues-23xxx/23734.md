We get a speedup of about 20%:

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 10.4 ms per loop
```
versus the old

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.1 ms per loop
```

This was part of the code I used to try and get a fast monomial * monomial for #23694.

gives

```
sage: %timeit test_itertools(3)
The slowest run took 7.87 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.03 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(3)

sage: %timeit test_itertools(10)
1 loop, best of 3: 200 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(10)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.16 s per loop
```
However, if we use:

```
sage: def test_next_perm(n):
....:     data = array('I', list(range(n)))
....:     while next_perm(data):
....:         pass
```
then we get

```
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(3)
The slowest run took 8.06 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 976 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(10)
10 loops, best of 3: 108 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(11)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.19 s per loop
sage: %timeit test_itertools(11)

So a *lot* of time is lost converting back to a list. However, if you can work only in arrays, then it becomes very quick.
