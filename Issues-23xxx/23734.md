We Cythonize the permutation iterator (`__iter__` method) for speed and for any class that wants to use them but just wanted to use lists.

Depends on #23702

<a id='comment:1'>Comment 1:</a>
We get a speedup of about 20%:

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 10.4 ms per loop
```
versus the old

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.1 ms per loop
```

This was part of the code I used to try and get a fast monomial * monomial for #23694.

gives

```
sage: %timeit test_itertools(3)
The slowest run took 7.87 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.03 µs per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(3)

1 loop, best of 3: 200 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(10)

```
However, if we use:

```
sage: def test_next_perm(n):
....:     data = array('I', list(range(n)))
....:     while next_perm(data):
....:         pass

then we get

1000000 loops, best of 3: 976 ns per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(10)
10 loops, best of 3: 108 ms per loop
sage: %timeit test_next_perm(11)
1 loop, best of 3: 1.19 s per loop

So a *lot* of time is lost converting back to a list. However, if you can work only in arrays, then it becomes very quick.

And you can have an unsafe faster `map_to_list` as follows

```
cdef extern from "Python.h":
    void Py_INCREF(PyObject *)

cdef extern from "listobject.h":
    list PyList_New(Py_ssize_t size)
    void PyList_SET_ITEM(list l, Py_ssize_t, PyObject *)

cdef extern from "tupleobject.h":
    PyObject * PyTuple_GET_ITEM(PyObject *op, Py_ssize_t i)

cpdef list map_to_list(array.array l, values, int n):
    cdef int i
    cdef list ret = PyList_New(n)
    cdef PyObject * t
    for i in range(n):
