We Cythonize the permutation iterator (`__iter__` method) for speed and for any class that wants to use them but just wanted to use lists.

We get a speedup of about 20%:

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 10.4 ms per loop
```
versus the old

```
sage: P = Permutations([1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5])
sage: %timeit list(P)
100 loops, best of 3: 12.1 ms per loop
```

This was part of the code I used to try and get a fast monomial * monomial for #23694.

```
