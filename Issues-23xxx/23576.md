```
sage: M = FreeModule(ZZ,1).span([vector([1/3])])
sage: x = M([1/3])
sage: x
(1/3)
sage: A = Matrix(QQ,[1])
sage: x*A , A*x
((1/3), (1/3))
```
This is good.

```
sage: B = Matrix(ZZ,[1])
sage: x*B , B*x
((1), (1/3))
```
The first entry is clearly wrong.
Somehow the first product is carried out in a wrong basis representation for x.

The problem appears in line 1122 of `sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.pyx`, inside the function `cdef _vector_times_matrix_(self, Vector v)`:

```
w = <Vector_integer_dense> v
```
If you change that to

```
w = <Vector_integer_dense?> v
```
you'll get an error, because `v` is a `Vector_rational_dense`, and if you change it to

```
try:
    w = <Vector_integer_dense?> v
except TypeError:
    return Matrix_dense._vector_times_matrix_(self, v)
```
you get `(1/3)`.

This function is replacing a more general implementation in `sage.matrix.matrix0`, but it only replaces `_vector_times_matrix_`, not `_matrix_times_vector_`, thus the disparity based on whether `B` is acting on the left or right.

I don't know if the try/except block is the right answer.  I'll think about it....

There's maybe a separate issue in `sage.matrix.action`, since it detects the base ring of the result by checking the base ring of the inputs.  But here `x` and `B` both have base ring `ZZ`, and indeed

```
sage: from sage.structure.element import coercion_model
sage: from operator import mul
sage: coercion_model.explain(x.parent(), B.parent(), mul)
Action discovered.
    Right action by Full MatrixSpace of 1 by 1 dense matrices over Integer Ring on Free module of degree 1 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
    Echelon basis matrix:
    [1/3]
Result lives in Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
```
The result should probably have rational entries....

Maybe #24031 is related to this? After all that bug occurs for vectors as well.
Does this one for matrices too?
