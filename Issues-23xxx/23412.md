The function `is_locally_represented_number_at_place` returns the wrong output in at least one case.  For the binary form <4,-4> we can see that it integrally represents 44, since 44=4(36)-4(25), so it certainly represents 44 locally at 2. However, 

```
sage: L=DiagonalQuadraticForm(ZZ,[4,-4])
sage: L.is_locally_represented_number_at_place(44,2)
False
```
This should return True.  The same error does not seem to appear at other primes,

```
sage: L.is_locally_represented_number_at_place(44,5)
True
sage: L.is_locally_represented_number_at_place(44,3)
True
```

L.local_representation_conditions(11,silent_flag=False)

This 2-dimensional form represents the p-adic integers of even
valuation for all primes p except [2].
For these and the reals, we have:
     Reals:   [0, 0]
     p = 2:   [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```
It does not comment on the primes of odd valuation. 

So my current hypothesis is that everything works as long as the valuation is even or the form has rank at least 3. We should also check if degenerate forms are handled.
