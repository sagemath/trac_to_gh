The current implementation of the global function `parent()` is:

```
cpdef inline parent(x):
    if isinstance(x, Element):
        return (<Element>x)._parent
    # Fast check for "number" types, including int and float
    if PyNumber_Check(x):
        return type(x)
    try:
        p = x.parent
    except AttributeError:
        return type(x)
    else:
        return p()
```
It turns out that the non-`Element` case is sufficiently slow to cause an important slow-down, as observed in #23905.

There are a few classes in Sage which do not inherit from `Element` but still define a `parent()` method:

```
src/sage/algebras/cluster_algebra.py:class ClusterAlgebraSeed(SageObject)
src/sage/combinat/root_system/weyl_characters.py:class WeightRing(CombinatorialFreeModule)
src/sage/combinat/species/structure.py:class GenericSpeciesStructure(CombinatorialObject)
src/sage/combinat/words/abstract_word.py:class Word_class(SageObject)
src/sage/dynamics/flat_surfaces/strata.py:class ConnectedComponentOfAbelianStratum(SageObject)
src/sage/geometry/lattice_polytope.py:class LatticePolytopeClass(SageObject, collections.Hashable)
src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py:class GaloisAutomorphism(SageObject)
src/sage/structure/sage_object.pyx:cdef class SageObject  # Returns type(self)
```

In some of those cases, there are probably better names than `parent` but were initially chosen to have compatibility of sorts with Sage's framework. Anyways, I doubt it would cause a problem in any private code.
