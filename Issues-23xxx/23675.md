On the other hand, importing from `sage.all` is convenient because it allows internal reorganization of the code without breaking those imports.

For circular imports, I would guess that it's mostly the top-level imports from `sage.all` which might be problematic. Imports inside a function should generally be safe.

But there seems to be a serious problem with imports in python3-sage (the infamous sage-import-hell ?), and I am trying to prepare the ground for this issue. This branch does no harm, right ?
