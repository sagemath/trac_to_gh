Currently there is no way to implement coercions using categories because of the default implementation of `Parent._coerce_map_from_`. We currently have two proposals for how to do these.

1) Use the normal hook `_coerce_map_from_` with a requirement to the effect of all classes must make a supercall up if not handled. Naturally calling successive `super._coerce_map_from_` is feasible and fits to an extent within the current coercion framework, but there are technical limitations with doing this in Python 2 within the category classes.

2) Implement a coercion hook in the relevant `ConstructionFunctor` (subclasses) with an additional check of this hook in the coercion discovery. This would better reflect the mathematics as the new morphisms usually come from applying the functor to a morphism.

See the discussion on #18700.
