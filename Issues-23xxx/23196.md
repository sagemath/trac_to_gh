There seems to be something wrong with the doctest parser: the doctest of `alloc_chunk_data()` in `src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/storage.py` is not run:

```
$ ./sage -t --verbose src/sage_setup/autogen/interpreters/storage.py
Trying (line 287):    from sage_setup.autogen.interpreters import *
Expecting nothing
ok [0.00 s]
Trying (line 288):    ty_mpfr.declare_chunk_class_members('args')
Expecting:
    u'    cdef int _n_args\n    cdef mpfr_t* _args\n'
ok [0.00 s]
Trying (line 290):    sig_on_count() # check sig_on/off pairings (virtual doctest)
Expecting:
    0
ok [0.00 s]
Trying (line 369):    from sage_setup.autogen.interpreters import *
Expecting nothing
ok [0.00 s]
Trying (line 370):    ty_double.class_member_declarations
