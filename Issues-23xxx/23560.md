<a id='comment:45'></a>I have looked over the three new files, and will do more tests later. For now, here are the typos/documentation errors I noticed:

Please correct the documentation in type_super_A.py (line 365). Remove the last clause, and perhaps indicate that "self" is a root:

``` 
def associated_coroot(self):
            """                                                                                                
            Return the coroot associated to ``self``, which is                                                 
            precisely ``self``.  
```

and a small typo “if positive if” -> “if positive is” in type_super_A.py (line 409):

```
If positive if ``True``, tests if it is on the strict positive                                 
side instead.
```

In bkk_crystals.py (line 35), suggest changing "super Lie algebra" to "Lie superalgebra" in:

I think it is okay not to mention it as it does not have to strictly be a root.

I fixed each of the other things.
