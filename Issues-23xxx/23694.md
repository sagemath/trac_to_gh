It is calling symmetrica:

```python
for t in symmetrica.kostka_tab(self.shape, self.weight):
    yield self.element_class(self, t)
```
from

```
sage: SST = SemistandardTableaux([1], eval=[0]*120+[1])
sage: SST.__iter__??
```
So a more MWE is

```
sage: from sage.libs.symmetrica.all import kostka_tab
sage: la = Partition([1])
sage: mu = Compositions()([0]*105+[1])
sage: kostka_tab(la, mu)
```
Ugg...that means I have to go digging through the symmetrica code again (#23403). I guess I have been the most recent person to do so, which means I will go through that code tomorrow after I get some sleep to see what is breaking.

I was able to trigger this bug at max_entry=100 but 99 seemed fine:

```
sage: for T in SemistandardTableaux([1], max_entry=100):
....:     print T
[[4]]
[[7]]
[[8]]
[[9]]
[[31]]
[[34]]
[[66]]
[[71]]
[[87]]
[[91]]
[[93]]
```
Second time I run this I get a seg fault.

I tried to identify if the symmetric function code was calling this in order to calculate coefficients (e.g. `m(s([2]+[1]*100))`) and fortunately it doesn't seem to be.

I've run into symmetrica implicit limits before: #15407 #15397

So currently we have the following places where symmetrica is used:
1. Symmetric functions:
   a. monomial * monomial in Sym
   b. Qp Hall-Littlewood polynomials
   c. expanding into a set of variables
2. Schubert polynomials
3. iterating over SSYT of fixed shape and weight

All others are unneeded imports and cleaned up by #23702. Here is the current state of things.

Franco and I looked into 1a, and our implementations of what we could find behaved horribly compared to Symmetrica. Franco took a much closer look than I did into trying to understand the Symmetrica code and understand their algorithm. However, at present, I do not understand what they are doing and why it is so much faster. For 1b, we can also use rigged configurations. For 1c, this should be straightforward to implement and may even be faster as Symmetrica just uses the definitions AFAIK.

For 2, see #23403, #23423, #6629.

I don't know about 3. I suspect they are using some sort of backtracking algorithm using recursion, but I am not 100% sure about that.

---

So IMO the low hanging fruit is 1b and 1c. This would be a good place to start. The only other key functionality we depend on is 3, and I think we need to keep that as fast as possible.

Beside this would *finally* enable expanding a Symmetric function f on
any finite alphabet whose values belong to some algebra over the base
ring of f, as in:

    S = SymmetricFunctions(Q)
    f = S.s().an_element()
    q = QQ['q'].gen()
    f([1,q,q<sup>2,q</sup>3])

So ++1 to that one!

Thanks for investigating the others too. For 3, this could be some
natural feature to add to lrcalc; maybe Anders (@asbuch) would be
willing to add it?

Alternatively, Florent @hivert: is this feature close enough from your
certified why3-generated lrcalc-style code that it could be integrated
there? Just throwing ideas in the air.

Cheers,
                             Nicolas
