<a id='comment:72'></a>There's still a bug with shifting:

```
sage: W.<a> = Zq(2^10,3)
sage: S.<x> = W[]
sage: OL.<pi> = W.extension(x^2 - 2*a*x + 2)
sage: OL(1) >> 1
a + pi + pi^3 + a*pi^4 + O(pi^5)
```

The last answer should be `0`, I guess.

In any case, results are not coherent:

```
sage: (OL(1) >> 1) >> 1
(a^2 + 1) + a*pi + pi^2 + O(pi^4)
sage: OL(1) >> 2
O(pi^4)
```
