[Osi (Open Solver Interface)](https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/) is a generic C++ interface to several (floating point) linear optimizers. It would be easier for Sage to use it. However, as cbc is, Osi is released under Eclise license. So before pushing for dual licensing, just make it an optional package.

The ticket is not yet in needs_review, but here are two points anyway:

- you should remove any reference to FLINT in `spkg-install` (probably copy/pasted) (i see two occurrences)
- you should provide an `spkg-check` script since the Makefile has a `test` rule.
