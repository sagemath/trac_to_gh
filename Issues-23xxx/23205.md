Currently, this fails even though all morphisms are known to be injective.

```
sage: QQ.hom(QQbar)*ZZ.hom(QQ)

Composite map:
  From: Integer Ring
  To:   Algebraic Field
  Defn:   Ring Coercion morphism:
          From: Integer Ring
          To:   Rational Field
        then
          Ring Coercion morphism:
          From: Rational Field
          To:   Algebraic Field
