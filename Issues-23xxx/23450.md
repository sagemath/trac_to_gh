Currently Smith form are not implemented over inexact rings.

This ticket provides a (currently unoptimized) implementation of Smith normal form over complete discrete valuation rings/fields (e.g. p-adic rings/fields).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23450

This is great. I was hoping that you would implement this for a while ;)

Have you thought about not creating a separate class for this but implementing it in the base ring (or in the category), i.e., provide `_matrix_smith_form` on the ring/category and call it from the generic matrix code if it is defined (otherwise fall back to the generic implementation). In other words, do what is already done for things like polynomial factorization.

Also, should this code be used for "exact" CDVRs such as the ones backed by absolute number fields?

Ok, I've moved the code to the category (CDVF and CDVR) as you suggested.

I've also tried to be more rigourous regarding precision and figured out what is the correct precision on the transformation matrices. (My first implementation was too optimistic.)

I've also removed the method that computes the determinant of a matrix because again it only worked for matrices given at flat precision.

- if `d_i` denotes the `(i,i)` entry of `S`, then `d_i`
divides `d_{i+1}` in the ring of integers for all `i`.

Ok for factoring the code this way if you prefer.

However, I think that the current code doesn't output the expected answer for matrices over Qp with `integral=None` (though I haven't checked it). In that case, I would say that the entries of Smith normal norm should all be 0 or 1.

In the doctest, I think that we should precise that we require (1) that the matrices U and V are invertible over the subring and (2) that d_{i+1}/d_i lies in the subring for all i.
