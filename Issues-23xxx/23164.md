I took the liberty to polish the docstrings a bit while I was at it.
Some comments:
- I removed the mention of composite n from the generic docstring since this is not the documentation that you see when you look at the docstring for a polynomial over `Z/nZ`.
- I removed the mention of ticket 5140 since I found the discussion there confusing and replaced it with the conclusion of that discussion.
- I did not add a doctest for the actual caching. How would I do that (without checking `type(f.is_irreducible)`?)
