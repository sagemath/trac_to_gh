Currently `is_eulerian()` accepts parameter `path`, but `is_hamiltonian` does not. This patch will correct that and makes Sage more orthogonal.

I do not understand why `hamiltonian_path` returns `None` and `hamiltonian_cycle` raises an exception, but that is a place for another ticket.

Good catch, corrected and also one unrelated typo in the same time.

I'm not a graph theorist, but there could be a good reason for differentiating between Eulerian and "strictly" semi-Eulerian.

This is bad behavior IMO to have this inconsistent output. I feel like it should have another argument `certificate` that determines whether or not a tuple is returned with the circuit/path.

I don't think so. The whole ticket started when I noticed an un-orthogonal design. Functions relating to "Hamiltonian properties" should mimic those relating "Eulerian properties" if possible.

I will ask more on sage-devel.

<a id='comment:22'></a>OK, so let this method have parameter `path`.

Then we should have a parameter `certificate` and to be complete, two parameters `u=None` and `v=None` so that we can ask whether the graph has a hamiltonian path between u and v, and may be a hamiltonian path starting at u.

I agree it's more work, but that would make the method very complete. The same should be done for `ie_eulerian` in another ticket.

I have no clear opinion between `path`-parameter vs. separate `is_traversable()` function. So yes, we can do that, but I would like to have some opinions at sage-devel. Should we wait for few days?
