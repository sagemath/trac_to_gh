Trivial patch to review.

I do not understand why `hamiltonian_path` returns `None` and `hamiltonian_cycle` raises an exception, but that is a place for another ticket.

Good catch, corrected and also one unrelated typo in the same time.

The list does not have even Eulerian... The list should be checked against properties known to Sage.

There is not a *non-closed* path that visits every edge. So this is the correct answer (with the current definitions).

This is bad behavior IMO to have this inconsistent output. I feel like it should have another argument `certificate` that determines whether or not a tuple is returned with the circuit/path.

I don't think so. The whole ticket started when I noticed an un-orthogonal design. Functions relating to "Hamiltonian properties" should mimic those relating "Eulerian properties" if possible.

OK, so let this method have parameter `path`.

Then we should have a parameter `certificate` and to be complete, two parameters `u=None` and `v=None` so that we can ask whether the graph has a hamiltonian path between u and v, and may be a hamiltonian path starting at u.

I agree it's more work, but that would make the method very complete. The same should be done for `ie_eulerian` in another ticket.
