Currently `is_eulerian()` accepts parameter `path`, but `is_hamiltonian` does not. This patch will correct that and makes Sage more orthogonal.

Trivial patch to review.

I do not understand why `hamiltonian_path` returns `None` and `hamiltonian_cycle` raises an exception, but that is a place for another ticket.

Good catch, corrected and also one unrelated typo in the same time.

The list does not have even Eulerian... The list should be checked against properties known to Sage.

This is bad behavior IMO to have this inconsistent output. I feel like it should have another argument `certificate` that determines whether or not a tuple is returned with the circuit/path.
