Currently `is_eulerian()` accepts parameter `path`, but `is_hamiltonian` does not. This patch will correct that and makes Sage more orthogonal.

Trivial patch to review.

I do not understand why `hamiltonian_path` returns `None` and `hamiltonian_cycle` raises an exception, but that is a place for another ticket.

Good catch, corrected and also one unrelated typo in the same time.

Clearly this one could be made better, but I still think that `path`-parameter to this is a good thing. It will make Sage more orthogonal. We can do more changes later.

No, I guess the discussion at sage-devel should be done first. I made another suggestion where we would have four functions, what you think about these:

- is_eulerian
- is_traversable
- is_hamiltonian
- is_traceable

There is not a *non-closed* path that visits every edge. So this is the correct answer (with the current definitions).

This is bad behavior IMO to have this inconsistent output. I feel like it should have another argument `certificate` that determines whether or not a tuple is returned with the circuit/path.

I don't think so. The whole ticket started when I noticed an un-orthogonal design. Functions relating to "Hamiltonian properties" should mimic those relating "Eulerian properties" if possible.

I will ask more on sage-devel.

I have no clear opinion between `path`-parameter vs. separate `is_traversable()` function. So yes, we can do that, but I would like to have some opinions at sage-devel. Should we wait for few days?
