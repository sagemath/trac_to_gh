As an example the warning at `make_confluent` at `finitely_presented.html` is not shown. This patch corrects some of those.

Useful:

```
egrep -R --include=*.py --no-filename -o '\.\.\s*[A-Z]+:' src/sage | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

True, must correct that.

* * *

I have never before looked at the patchbot plugins code. The triple colon plugin seems to be simple:

```
exclude_new(ticket, regex=r':\s*::', msg="Triple colon (:::)", **kwds)
```

Is it possible to add a plugin to check for Sphinx directives?

I forgot `.. MATH::`, thanks. Are others used in Sage?

Is it possible to add own pre-defined directives? It is odd that we have "special" markup `.. NOTE::` but no `.. ALGORITHM::`.

Do we have "substructures" in logical sense? I mean something like having a `NOTE` explaining something in `INPUT` section, some `WARNING` inside `ALGORITHM` etc?

Yes: within Sage, do `search_src('\.\. [A-Z]*::')`.
 
> Is it possible to add own pre-defined directives? It is odd that we have "special" markup `.. NOTE::` but no `.. ALGORITHM::`.


I expect that it is, but I've never tried. In another reality, we could have much more structured docstrings, with `.. ALGORITHM::`, `.. EXAMPLES::`, `.. TESTS::`, etc.

> Do we have "substructures" in logical sense? I mean something like having a `NOTE` explaining something in `INPUT` section, some `WARNING` inside `ALGORITHM` etc?


I don't know.
