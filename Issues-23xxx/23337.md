Where possible, use `QQ["x"]` instead of `QQ[x]` to construct polynomial rings. After #10483, the latter will be deprecated.

I think I understand what is going wrong with `flatten.py`. It is checking the keys in `D`, which are actual variables and hence, do not compare with the string values. So the variable names all get included when constructing `new_vars` on this line:

```python
new_vars = [[[t for t in v if t not in newD.keys()], b] for v,b in old_vars]
```
I think I see a good way to fix this. I also am going to do a slight bit of cleanup of that method.
