sage: libgap(vector((0,1,2)))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: libGAP: Error, Permutation: <expr> must be a positive integer (not a integer)
```

`libgap` is trying to build an object from the string representation. Since this representation is made with paranthesis, `libgap` tries to construct a permutation... which must be on positive integer.

We should just translate vectors into gap lists (that is what it uses for vectors).
