Rethink the syntax of `GlobalOptions`. This is mainly meant to address the problem that the `doc` and `end_doc` attributes of a `GlobalOptions` object are not doctested (see #16693 and #18051 which were closed as duplicate of #14272 but which would better be fixed independently).

I am thinking of replacing

```
options = GlobalOptions('menu',
    doc='Fancy documentation\n'+'-'*19, end_doc='The END!',
    entree=dict(...), ...)
```
by

```
class options(GlobalOptions):
    """
    Fancy documentation
    -------------------

    @OPTIONS@

    The END!
    """
    name = "menu"
    entree = dict(...)
```

In other words, to use the `class` statement purely as a custom syntax, but without actually creating a class. The main advantage of this syntax is that doctests are just ordinary doctests, there is no need for `doc=` and `end_doc=` arguments.

This ticket is about enabling the new syntax in addition to the old syntax. Converting the existing use-cases of `GlobalOptions` will be delegated to follow-up tickets.

Not having the global options doc-tested seems to be causing problems, and all documentation should be doc-tested, so I think that this is a good idea. This said, I am surprised that there is testable code hidden in the global options that is not doc-tested elsewhere: tests for all methods should be given in the methods.

For what it's worth, my initial plan was to write the options as a class but one of the people I discussed this with thought that creating a class for each set of options was a little OTT.

Class attributes and instance attributes behave in exactly the same way:

```sage
sage: class Foo(object):
....:     bar = 5
....:     def __init__(self):
....:         self.var = -1
sage: f = Foo()
sage: f.bar
5
sage: f.var
-1
sage: f.bar = 2
sage: f2 = Foo()
sage: f2.bar
5
sage: f.bar
2
```
So having the class level attribute of `_name` is the same as setting `_name` in the `__init__` (as far as the object is concerned). So it feels much more natural to me to be setting the name by using `_name`.

I think this is the best way forward.

To me, the `_name` attribute on the instance is an implementation detail which is unrelated to the construction of the object. So I don't see it as an argument in favour of `_name` (but also not against it, it's just not relevant in my opinion).

I have also been considering `NAME` in all capitals. What do you think?

Since this ticket is about setting the API for `GlobalOptions` and this will be used as part of the API, so I feel it is relevant.

Well, this goes to the statement I made about breaking encapsulation, but I want to make it part of the API in a way. At least since we don't have an `__init__` with a set signature (well, as much as Python can give).

This also is good for me as it is clear it is special. I have a very mild preference for `_name` over `NAME`, but my opinion is not very strong (other than it not being `name`).
