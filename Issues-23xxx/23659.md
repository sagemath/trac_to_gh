```

You have indented input sections as

```
- parameter -- a longer explanation
               of the parameter.
```

whereas most parts seems to use

```
- parameter -- a longer explanation
  of the parameter.
```

I am not sure how Sphinx will react to this. Maybe Travis can comment this.

(And yes, I am quite paranoid about Sphinx doing something odd...)
