The goal of this ticket will be to implement increasing labelings of a poset as a class. 

A (strictly) increasing labeling is a map f from a poset P to the integers Z such that if x<y in P, then f(x)<f(y). This constrasts from a linear extension as this function need not be injective (a label can appear multiple times) nor surjective (we don't need to use every label between 1 and |P|). Similarly, one could define weakly increasing labelings where  x<=y in P implies f(x)<=f(y). Further, one could look at strictly/weakly decreasing labelings (strict P-partitions and P-partitions, respectively).

<a id='comment:1'></a>One class would be a global class (all increasing labelings of a given poset).

Another class would include the specification of a function from P to subsets of Z indicating which set of values we want to allow a given element to be labelled as (this roughly corresponds to 'P-partitions with restricted parts').

Lastly, there would be a class where we specify a largest possible label N, and we have all increasing labelings that use the numbers 1,...,N (roughly 'P-partitions with largest part).
