This branch merged with 8.1.beta9 builds from distclean, after two failures to build brial (`pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'pip' distribution was not found`). Just restarting the make succeeded. This was after upgrading OpenSuSE from 42.2 to 42.3.

I'd suggest requiring the 42.3 upgrade as it is no pain and very easy to do.
