Sage's gcc does not build with Xcode 9.0 (released 19 Sept 2017?). See [the log file](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~palmieri/Sage/gcc-5.4.0.log).

This is the actual error:

In our lcalc-1.23 the line `lcalc-1.23/src/Makefile:MACHINE_SPECIFIC_FLAGS = -ffast-math -fPIC` is no longer in the newer version at https://github.com/dimpase/lcalc which is enhanced from the last official version at https://code.google.com/archive/p/l-calc/, see [#23341 comment:35](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23341#comment:35)

So, in order to enable building on systems with glibc < 2.23 at least the lcalc Makefile should be patched. Even better would be the upgrade to the version at https://github.com/dimpase/lcalc. I propose to hijack #23341 for this and make it a dependency of this ticket.

There is the possibility the OpenSuSE gcc-5.3.1 has something our gcc-5.4.0 does not have. I'm compiling 5.4.0 right now.

We need someone with an old glibc who can test out different patches. Would it be worth trying (on another ticket) upgrading to GCC 6.4.0? We need to get something into Sage so it will build with the most recent version of OS X and Xcode.

This branch merged with 8.1.beta9 builds from distclean, after two failures to build brial (`pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'pip' distribution was not found`). Just restarting the make succeeded. This was after upgrading OpenSuSE from 42.2 to 42.3.

I'd suggest requiring the 42.3 upgrade as it is no pain and very easy to do.
