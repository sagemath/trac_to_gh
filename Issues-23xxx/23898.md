Not all gcc mirror seem to carry the same tarball. When I did experiments last week, one mirror was carrying a >100MB tarball (with several other stuff included like go) compared to the one on the main mirror. So get the one linked here rather than the one on a closer mirror. Someone messed up big time upstream.

This might indicate that the tarball you got didn't match - then it is silently deleted and an attempt to download one is made.

The tarball linked is huge, in fact, over 100Mb.

Does this now build for you?

This branch merged with 8.1.beta9 builds from distclean, after two failures to build brial (`pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'pip' distribution was not found`). Just restarting the make succeeded. This was after upgrading OpenSuSE from 42.2 to 42.3.

I'd suggest requiring the 42.3 upgrade as it is no pain and very easy to do.
