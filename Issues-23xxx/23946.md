I have reasonably stable code (mostly in C, depending on FLINT) for exhausting over Weil polynomials:

https://github.com/kedlaya/root-unitary

The goal of this ticket is to incorporate this code into Sage in some fashion.

Status update: I've pushed many recent changes to the branch `repackage_for_sage` of the Github repo. In particular, I have been working to make the call syntax much more transparent; for instance, to compute the Weil polynomials corresponding to abelian varieties of dimension `g` over the finite field of order `q`, one can now use standard Python iterator syntax:

```
sage: wp = WeilPolynomials(2*g, q)
sage: for i in wp:
...
```
Some to-do items: check that all my old test scripts still work; write more tests; add more documentation; add more input sanitization.

In the meantime, I'd appreciate some feedback about where this might belong in Sage.

First of all, your github repo contains both C code and `.sage` files. Are the `.sage` files considered to be part of your package or are they really only use cases/examples/tests/documentation?


There are two possibilities, each with its advantages and disadvantages:

(A) Make it an external (presumably optional) package and interface it from Sage.

(B) Make it actually a part of Sage itself.

Advantages of (A) are that you keep control of the package: you can easily change the package at will (with (B) every change would need to go through the Sage Trac) and you don't need to care about Sage coding standards. Also important: with (A) your package could be used without Sage. With (B), there might be more initial work needed to get it into Sage but then it might be less work to maintain.

Do you mean put everything in there? Or put the Cython in `sage/rings/polynomials/weil_polynomials.pyx` and the C files in `sage/rings/polynomial/weil`?

Also, if someone can point me to some guidance about a module to the Sage library (e.g., how to format `__init__.py` and `all.py` and the like to make the new code discoverable), that would be helpful.

    "body": "<a id='comment:26'></a>\nAlright, I made the other changes I wanted to make (most notably adding a method to polynomial rings).  Here are some documentation questions that I'd like to see addressed, but I think this ticket is basically ready to go.\n\n* I don't understand how specifying congruence constraints on leading coefficients works.  I tried the following:\n\n```\nsage: R.<T> = ZZ[]\nsage: R.weil_polynomials(4,2,lead=((1,0),(0,2)))\n[T^4 + 4, T^4 - T^2 + 4, T^4 - 2*T^2 + 4, T^4 - 3*T^2 + 4, T^4 - 4*T^2 + 4]\n```\nI would expect this to give polynomials where the coefficient of `T^3` was even, but I'm not sure what I'm getting.  Is it ignoring the 2 and giving me those where the coefficient of `T^3` is exactly 0?

Alright, I made the other changes I wanted to make (most notably adding a method to polynomial rings).  Here are some documentation questions that I'd like to see addressed, but I think this ticket is basically ready to go.

* I don't understand how specifying congruence constraints on leading coefficients works.  I tried the following:

```
sage: R.<T> = ZZ[]
sage: R.weil_polynomials(4,2,lead=((1,0),(0,2)))
[T^4 + 4, T^4 - T^2 + 4, T^4 - 2*T^2 + 4, T^4 - 3*T^2 + 4, T^4 - 4*T^2 + 4]
```
I would expect this to give polynomials where the coefficient of `T^3` was even, but I'm not sure what I'm getting.  Is it ignoring the 2 and giving me those where the coefficient of `T^3` is exactly 0?  Kiran, can you give me an idea of how this functionality is supposed to work?
* I don't quite understand what `node_limit` does.  Raises a `RuntimeError` if the number of terminal nodes ever exceeds the given value?
* Similarly, I guessed that `squarefree` omits polynomials that are not squarefree.

Overall, can you check/correct the changes I made?  Also, if there's anything else useful to be said about how to recompile with OpenMP support, feel free to augment the documentation that I added.

I made a few tweaks in the latest commits. I really like having a method for polynomial rings; I'm guessing most users will only use the code this way. The iterator is really only needed for power use cases.

Since there is already an `is_weil_polynomial` method for polynomial elements, I edited the docstring for that method to point to `weil_polynomials` and vice versa.

You just caught a bug in the C code which I have now fixed (here and upstream). I added a doctest documenting how this is supposed to work.

> * I don't quite understand what `node_limit` does.  Raises a `RuntimeError` if the number of terminal nodes ever exceeds the given value?


Correct. It is there as a failsafe in case you don't want your code to run forever.

> * Similarly, I guessed that `squarefree` omits polynomials that are not squarefree.
> 
 
Correct, except that there was a (long-known) bug in that too. I fixed that and added a doctest.

> Overall, can you check/correct the changes I made?  Also, if there's anything else useful to be said about how to recompile with OpenMP support, feel free to augment the documentation that I added.


One issue is that on my system, I have to put the distutils lines at the top of the code when uncommenting them, which I think runs contrary to Sage conventions. I added a comment about this.

Since it seems we are basically into the review phase anyway, let me go ahead and set state accordingly. I would be particularly open to suggestions for additional doctests; there are probably many use cases I haven't thought to test yet, and I'd like to make sure not to break those in future versions of the code.

A few last-minute changes:

- There was a trivial bug in `polynomial_ring.py` about checking the base ring (which patchbot also noticed); I fixed that and added some doctests to confirm.
- I fixed some compiler warnings on the backend.
- I added a link to the github repo in the main package docstring.

That's probably enough doctests for the moment; I'll inevitably have to add more in response to later bugfixes. Let's see what patchbot has to say next.
