Reported by Paul Zimmermann and confirmed by me:

With Sage 7.6, after having done `sage -i database_gap`, I get:

```
sage: is_package_installed("database_gap")
True
sage: x = polygen(QQ); (x^5 - x - 1).galois_group()
verbose 0 (2061: permgroup_named.py, cardinality) Warning: TransitiveGroups requires the GAP database package. Please install it with `sage -i database_gap`.

<a id='comment:23'></a>I confirm it works now with the git version (SageMath version 8.0.beta9).

1) I first tried without the Gap database, and I get the error:

```
verbose 0 (2061: permgroup_named.py, cardinality) Warning: TransitiveGroups requires the GAP database package. Please install it with ``sage -i database_gap``.
```

2) then I did `sage -i database_gap`, and then I get:

```

Forcing sage-location, probably because a new package was installed.
Updating various hardcoded paths...

Done updating paths.
sage: x = polygen(QQ); (x^5 - x - 1).galois_group()

```
thus positive review on my side.
