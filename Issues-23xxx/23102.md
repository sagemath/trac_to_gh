Sage has a lot of functionality to deal with "rich comparisons" using `__richcmp__` in Cython or `_richcmp_` in Python or Cython for subclasses of `Element`. However, we are still missing rich comparison support for Python classes which are not subclasses from `Element`.

A good example of this is `RealSet` in `src/sage/sets/real_set.py`. Currently, comparison is implemented using `__cmp__`. Changing this to Python 3 comparisons would normally require 6 methods (`__eq__`, `__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, `__ge__`). It would be convenient to support this with just one `__richcmp__` method like in Cython.

This ticket proposes:

1. Add a decorator `richcmp_method` which adds support for `__richcmp__` to a Python class.

2. Implement `RealSet.__richcmp__` using this.

What about using ``@`total_ordering` to reduce the number of rich comparison methods? I know this is an abuse of terminology, but it does mean we only need to define `__eq__` and `__lt__`. However, I generally do like the idea of having a consistent API.

1. ``@`total_ordering` reduces the number of rich comparison methods from 6 to 2. This ticket reduces it from 6 to 1.

2. ``@`total_ordering` is less efficient (if you only have `==` and `<`, you might need two calls to determine `<=`)

I just did that, see [attachment:cmp-timing.py]

First of all, for a plain equality check (``@`total_ordering` is not involved in this), the timing is almost the same for `__eq__` and `__richcmp__`, the latter being just slightly slower:

```
sage: load("cmp-timing.py")
sage: timeit('A1 == A2', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 281 ns per loop
sage: timeit('B1 == B2', number=1000000, repeat=100)
1000000 loops, best of 100: 293 ns per loop
```

Now, comparisons involving ``@`total_ordering` take almost twice or three times as much time:

```
sage: load("cmp-timing.py")
sage: timeit('A1 > A2', number=1000000, repeat=20)   # calls A2.__lt__(A1)
1000000 loops, best of 20: 557 ns per loop
sage: timeit('B1 > B2', number=1000000, repeat=20)
1000000 loops, best of 20: 292 ns per loop
```

```
sage: load("cmp-timing.py")
sage: timeit('A2 <= A1', number=1000000, repeat=20)  # Calls A2.__lt__(A1) and A2.__eq__(A1)
1000000 loops, best of 20: 820 ns per loop
sage: timeit('B2 <= B1', number=1000000, repeat=20)
1000000 loops, best of 20: 293 ns per loop
```
As one might expect, the time is roughly linear in the number of Python method calls.

To answer my own question, this wouldn't be a concern I guess since this will just override the parent class's `__lt__` and that's to be expected.

It would be good to have a test of subclassing and overriding one of the comparison operators though.
