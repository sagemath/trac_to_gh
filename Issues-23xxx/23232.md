This ticket:

- Let `SymmetricFunctions` use the generic implementation of
  `inject_shorthands` for consistency and duplication reduction.

- Side effect: the list of defined shorthands is printed out, as for
  quasi symmetric functions & the like, which is helpful for the user.

- Adds the forgotten symmetric functions to the shorthands.

- Suppresses the `redefining xxx` warnings. They were deemed annoying
  by many users, and somewhat redudant with the list of defined
  shorthands. This is also consistent with the behavior of
  `inject_variable` of polynomial rings,

- Changes the message from "Injecting shorthand ..." to "Defining
  shorthand ...": this is clearer for the user and consistent with
  the behavior of `inject_variable`.

- Adds an option `verbose=False` to suppress the messages of `inject_variable`.

- Adds an option `warn` to sage.misc.misc.inject_variable`

Altogether, this gives:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ).inject_shorthands()
Defining e as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the elementary basis
Defining f as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the forgotten basis
Defining h as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the homogeneous basis
Defining m as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the monomial basis
Defining p as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the powersum basis
Defining s as shorthand for Symmetric Functions over Rational Field in the Schur basis
```

Instead of:

```
sage: SymmetricFunctions(QQ).inject_shorthands()
/opt/sage-git/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/combinat/sf/sf.py:1416: RuntimeWarning: redefining global value `e`
  inject_variable(shorthand, getattr(self, shorthand)())
```

(ticket implemented after discussion with Viviane Pons, François
Bergeron, Florent Hivert, Franco Saliola).

Thanks Anne for the feedback. I don't really have an opinion.

I could see there being conflicts with people using f as a variable name for a function/polynomial/etc., and it being overwritten by the forgotten basis, which they may have never learned exists in the first place.

Right now, I believe there's an optional parameter that defaults to giving the classical bases, but you can also set it to give a specific set of bases to inject. Maybe that could be modified so the default gives the classical bases, there's an option like "All" that will inject all implemented bases, and the user could still specificy a specific set of bases they want injected.

Franco's opinion goes along the same line: by default, inject only the "classical" bases from (basically those from Macdonald's book), thus including forgotten but not witt. And have an "all" parameter.

This can be implemented reasonnably generically. So I'll proceed this way unless someone comments differently soon.

Fixed trivial doctest failure reported by the patchbot + Frédéric.
My patchbot reported many other failures, but that's because it's not yet properly setup (ssl strikes back); to be ignored.
