```
Currently, a polynomial prints all the coefficients that are non-zero.

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: R([1,0,1])
x^2 + 1
```

This of course makes perfect sense but leads to issues when determining whether an element is zero or not is not possible or very hard as is the case with some of the elements introduced in #22956.

There, we essentially have the following situation:

```
sage: def __nonzero__(self):
....:     raise NotImplementedError()
....: 
sage: sage.rings.qqbar.AlgebraicNumber.__nonzero__ = __nonzero__
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: R([1,0,1])
NotImplementedError
```

This ticket changes the printing to print an element even if `__nonzero__` raises an error:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: R([1,0,1])
x^2 + 0*x + 1
```

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but in many Sage rings, `__nonzero__()` is understood as “syntactically nonzero” or “not trivially zero”, as opposed to “known not to be zero”. For example, elements of `RIF`, `CIF`, `RBF`, `CIF` etc. that contain zero but are not point intervals are `__nonzero__()` . At least some of the generic polynomial/matrix/... code respects this convention. I think it would make sense to have everything in Sage use this definition.
