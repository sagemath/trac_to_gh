Dear Lokesh,

why have you removed file `modular_decomposition.pyx` ? You should put it back for the moment. There are dependencies and so I'm unable to compile sage with your patch.

Many improvements are needed in your code that we will slowly address. Dima is certainly more expert than me in this. For instance:
- Comments must be in 80 column mode. Some editors like emacs ease the formatting.
- Prefer `# Nested module` to `#Nested module` to improve readability
- You can also insert some empty lines in some code blocks to improve readability
- `Returns True if ...` -> `Return True if ...`
- You will also have to insert some `TESTS:` and `EXAMPLES:` blocks to illustrate the behavior of the methods, in particular for `modular_decomposition`, and for testing cases that could lead to errors.

this is the updates needed for Sage to build and run. modular_decomposition doctests in graph.py fail due to some format incompatibility of output of the new implementation.
I'll leave it to Lokesh to fix, as well as the David's comments, naturally.

I have added the commit for fixing the doctests and added the Tests and Examples for modular_decomposition function. Should I add the examples for other functions as well? Because most of the functions are called from modular_decomposition itself. 

For the tests for modular_decomposition I have added the graph from Marc Tedder research paper and an example from the wikipedia modular decomposition page. Further I have added a series graph (Tetrahedral Graph).

Is there a function to create the quotient graph with the vertices being the max. modules? 

Please also make it clear which functions are a part of the main algorithm, and which ones are only used for testing.

Please also add more `TEST` and `EXAMPLE`; e.g. the functions to compute `mu` certainly need tests.
In general, all the functions, except 1-liners, will need tests and docs.

Some comments:
- in class `Queue`, method `get` could return a `ValueError`. Isn't it more appropriate to directly raise an error? 
- in `form_module`, variable `flag` can be removed to use `while True:`
- in `either_connected_or_not_connected`, use `graph.has_edge(u, v)` instead of `v in graph.neighbors(u)`
- method `number_subtree` could be an internal method of `recursively_number_cocomponents`. Only used here and `number_subtree` is the recursive part
- in `assembly`: `while not len(root[1]) == 1:` -> `while len(root[1]) != 1:` ?
- in `update_comp_num`, instead of `tree` you could use `child`
- in `get_vertex_in`: improve the description since the output block gives more details than the 1 line decription. Also, you don't need a recursive method here. You could rewrite it as

```python
while tree[0].node_type != NORMAL:
    tree = tree[1][0]
return tree[1][0]
```
- `if left_index - 1 >= 0:` -> `if left_index >= 1:`  ?
- in `is_component_connected`, you don't need to convert explicitly `neighbor` to set. The `isdisjoint` accepts a `list` as input.
- method `recurse_component` should be an internal method of `get_vertices`

In fact, you can directly build the set `x` as `x = {u for u in graph.neighbor_iterator(v) if vertex_dist[u] != vertex_dist[v]}. You will then have to update the definition of `x` in the inputs of `maximal_subtrees_with_leaves_in_x`
- in `maximal_subtrees_with_leaves_in_x`, instead of using `root[1][-1][0]` and `root[1][-2][1]`, why not creating first node `a`, filling it, add it to `root[1]`,  then creating node `b`, filling it and adding it to `root[1]` ?
- Add one line description to methods `create_prime_node`, etc.
- the test methods (`test_modular_decomposition`, etc.) should be move at the end of the file after a separator like `#=====================...` 


The writing style in sagemath is to start methods with a 1 line description of the functionality, then a blank line, then a longer description of the functionality if needed. So

```python
def recursively_number_cocomponents(tree, cocomp_num, by_type):
    """
    Recursively number the nodes in the (co)components.

    If the tree node_type is same as by_type then cocomp_num is incremented
    before assigning to the subtree else entire tree is numbered by cocomp_num.

    INPUTS:
    """
```

It's a long patch to review...

Currently there is no function which creates a quotient graph with the vertices being the maximal modules. I can create such a function though?
> Please also make it clear which functions are a part of the main algorithm, and which ones are only used for testing.

David has asked me to move the test functions at the end after a separator, it will solve this problem.
> Please also add more `TEST` and `EXAMPLE`; e.g. the functions to compute `mu` certainly need tests.
> In general, all the functions, except 1-liners, will need tests and docs.

I will definitely add more TESTS and EXAMPLES. It might take some time as each function requires some arguments mostly a tree or a module. I will need to input that manually.

Thanks for fixing the import and copyright!

It is much better now. Some more comments.

- on the left hand side, you don't need to write `[a,b] = [1,2]`. You can directly write `a,b = [1,2]`

- You can permute variables without intermediate variable as `a,b = b,a`

- in method `__str__`, you don't need variable `string`. You can directly return the result.

- in the EXAMPLES block of `modular_decomposition`, you must put `::` at the end of the sub blocks instead of `:`. This is for the html documentation.

- Some of the examples in the TESTS block of `modular_decomposition` could be in the EXAMPLES block. Also, can you add sub blocks with indication on the origin of the tested graphs ?

- Then, can you have tests for bad inputs in `modular_decomposition`, like directed graph, etc. i.e., the raise error stuff

- I have an identation issue with the `"""` before the code

- in `compute_mu_for_co_component`: You don't need the intermediate variable `mu_for_co_component`.

- in `compute_mu_for_component`: why not using `range(source_index-1, -1, -1)` and returning the first found value ?

- method `recursive_print_md_tree` could be an internal method of `print_md_tree`. Also, instead of using `level`, you could directly pass a string as parameter, `recursive_print_md_tree(tree, level + "   ")`. Last, use `print("{}{}".format(level,str(root[0])))` for Python 3 compatibility.

I could not understand which `"""` you are talking about? Is it the one in the beginning? Is the indentation issue in the doc build?

```
  if mu_for_component == root[1][index] and \
```

Suppose [c01, c02, c03, source, c1, c2, c3] is the forest. If mu value for c2 is c03 then c01 and c02 must be connected to c2. Therefore the iteration from 0 is required.

I have incorporated the other changes and will add a commit for it.

The one before `if graph._directed`.
 
Note that it is better to use `if graph.is_directed()` ;)

It's a good idea to document what these PRIME, etc., stand for from Python point of view.
Are they some kind of constants?

IMHO it's a question of constructing the induced subgraph, with vertices taken to be

I would just add a member `NodeInfo.children` beeing a list of `NodeInfo`s and rename this `NodeInfo` into something catchier.
This would e.g. change

```sage
for tree in root[1]:
    if tree[0].node_type == NORMAL and tree[1][0] in vertex_status
    ...
```
into the more expressive

```sage
for node in root.children:
    if node.node_type == NORMAL and node.children[0] in vertex_status
    ...

In `graph.py`:
- `if self.order() == 0 or self.order() == 1:` -> `if self.order() <= 1:`

In `modular_decomposition.py`:

- Why are you defining the string representation of class `NodeType` ? I think it is not used and `self.name` is not assigned here. And why not for class `NodeSplit`.

- I the test <code>Graph from wikipedia link :wikipedia:\`Modular_decomposition\`::\`</code>, you must change `sage: g = Graph(d)` to `sage: g = Graph(d2)`.

It is used in graph.py for printing the module type.

```
relabel = lambda x : (x.node_type, [relabel(_) for _ in x.children]) if x.node_type != NodeType.NORMAL else id_label[x.children[0]]
```
Here x.node_type is an object of NodeType class. For NodeType.PARALLEL it would be PARALLEL.

You have removed the reference `HabPau10`. It should stay, as it is a recent
survey paper on the topic, in fact, newer than `TedCorHabPaul08`.
Also, note that this reference is still used in the text, and as a result docs don't build any more. 

Perhaps it's time that you should check docs for building, before pushing in changes to them :-)

Anyhow, I'm putting the reference back.

So, how about adding missing tests?
It's basically just adding temporary print() statements into functions with missing doctests, recoding the results of printing for an example run, and converting these into
doctests.

If you are too busy now, I can do this, I don't want to sit on this ticket for too long...
