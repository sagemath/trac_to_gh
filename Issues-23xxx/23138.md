As described in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/jN6inWPyElM, `assume()` takes more and more time the bigger the `assumptions()` data base is. This causes a lot of slow-downs when e.g. declaring variables with a `domain` argument. Nils Bruin suggested that this is due to excessive interactions with the Maxima library and Ralf Stephan suggested that the assumptions could be cached and only sent to Maxima when needed, to speed up the process.

The first commit prevents calls to Maxima, so it should result in a speedup. There is however a bug in Pynac (fixed in 0.7.9) that prevents it from working correctly. With the fix a few doctests fail, so this needs the planned injection of variable domains (EDITED).

What takes the time with inconsistency checking is `maxima.assume()` so there would be no difference.
