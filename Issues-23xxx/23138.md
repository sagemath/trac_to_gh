As described in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/jN6inWPyElM, `assume()` takes more and more time the bigger the `assumptions()` data base is. This causes a lot of slow-downs when e.g. declaring variables with a `domain` argument. Nils Bruin suggested that this is due to excessive interactions with the Maxima library and Ralf Stephan suggested that the assumptions could be cached and only sent to Maxima when needed, to speed up the process.

Following on from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-A8ZzSKvYsA, `assume()` sends assumptions both to maxima and Pynac. In addition, `assume()` tests if the assumptions are consistent, which is probably not needed when we define a new variable. So, instead of calling `assume()` in `var()` maybe we should just replace it by the same as is done in `assume()` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx#L1785), i.e. `maxima.assume()`. 

Therefore, instead of removing send_sage_domain_to_maxima as in the patch, I would propose to substitute `maxima.assume()` for all `assume()` calls in `send_sage_domain_to_maxima()` (https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx#1017). Did I miss something?

Replying to [rws](#comment%3A11):
> The first commit prevents calls to Maxima, so it should result in a speedup. There is however a bug in Pynac (fixed in 0.7.9) that prevents it from working correctly. With the fix a few doctests fail, so this needs the planned injection of variable domains (EDITED).

What takes the time with inconsistency checking is `maxima.assume()` so there would be no difference.

Just to mention that `var(..., domain='real', ...)` is used in the code (not doctest part) for manifolds (specifically real manifolds); see line 1449 of `src/sage/manifolds/chart.py`.
