Use the C++ features of Cython instead of using `ccobject.h` hacks.

The interface is significantly more complicated than some other C++ interfaces. There are also some Cython oddities that I have not investigated further. Therefore, the result may not be super clean, but it's certainly a large improvement over the current situation.

This is harder than some other library clean up ticket. In particular I do not understand why some things are wrapped as `DefaultRinged<T>` instead of just `T`.

For example, why
