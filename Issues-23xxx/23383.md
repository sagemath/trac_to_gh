This patch adds precomputing intervals in the `HasseDiagram` to speed up some congruence-related lattice functions. If `L = Posets.BooleanLattice(7)`, then we have

```
sage: timeit("list(L._hasse_diagram.congruences_iterator())")
5 loops, best of 3: 4.63 s per loop
```

and after `L._hasse_diagram._precompute_intervals()`

```
sage: timeit("list(L._hasse_diagram.congruences_iterator())")
5 loops, best of 3: 656 ms per loop
```

OTOH this will eat memory.

Currently this feature is well hidden, only available as a `_`-function of a `_`-variable. Later we should think about interface. A global "save-cpu-eat-memory" -switch or "aux functions" to lattices (posets?) or something else?

<a id='comment:4'></a>I consider Hasse diagrams not as part of the true API, but an implementation detail of posets. So I don't see any problem with changing the output type. Although it is part of the API for `HasseDiagram`, thus, it technically is a backwards incompatible change.

Also, it might be faster to have the `dict` indexed by a pair `(x,y)` as it only needs to do 1 hash and table lookup instead of 2. Also, a better way to populate `_intervals`:

```
self._intervals = {u: {v: v_up[u].intersection(v_down[v]) for v in range(n)}
                   for u in range(n)}
```
There is no need to create the empty object and you save a lot of Python calls by doing the dict comprehension.

Actually, even faster should be a list of lists, that needs no lookup at all.

True. I was thinking about lists but then somehow ended up to dict in this PoC.

And now the most important:

> I consider Hasse diagrams not as part of the true API, but an implementation detail of posets. So I don't see any problem with changing the output type.


OK. I tested by adding precomputing to `__init__` of poset. Only errors I got from long test of `combinat/posets` where from `.open_interval` in `posets.py`. But I think currently intervals are given as in the linear extension order, and that is propably a good thing.

Well, there still is a lookup, but now it is (relatively) very fast. +1 for list of lists.

-This patch is PoC for precomputing intervals in the `HasseDiagram` to speed up some congruence-related lattice functions. As an example, for `L = posets.BooleanLattice(6)` it takes 1070 ms to compute `L.is_isoform()`. After `L._hasse_diagram._precompute_intervals()` it drops to 560 milliseconds.

The problem is, IMO, `UniqueRepresentation`. No created poset will ever be freed from the memory, and so making test with random posets will eventually eat all the memory. And if we compute `lequal_matrix()` or `_meet` etc, those will be saved too. That's why I am worried about this.

I will formulate longer description for `_atl_interval`.

I do not think so by default because of how much memory this would use. Although it could be something we do for small posets (less that 5 vertices?).

That should not be true. Once you delete all references to a poset, it should be freeable as it is a weak reference (otherwise it is a memory leak bug).

> When should this precomputing be called? In `interval()`? In `congruence()`? In, say, `is_isoform()`?


Probably in none of these places, but instead we should document it as an alternative method for increasing the speed.

If that would be true, then for example this should print the same number again and again:

```
i = 0
j = 0
for P in Posets(8):
    j += 1
    if j % 1000 == 0:
        print(sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage())
    if P.is_connected():
        i += 1
print(i)
```

(Compare this with same except `digraphs(8)` instead of `Posets(8)`.)

Currently there is no way to for example search for counter-example with random posets to unlimited time.

The problem is propably memory overcommit or usage of every bit of memory. When almost every byte is used, Linux is extremely slow, and so never goes to the limit where Python would give out-of-memory exception.

This should be handled in Python level or in OS level. Sage can only add some temporary workarounds.
