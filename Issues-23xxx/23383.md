This patch adds precomputing intervals in the `HasseDiagram` to speed up some congruence-related lattice functions. If `L = Posets.BooleanLattice(7)`, then we have

```
sage: timeit("list(L._hasse_diagram.congruences_iterator())")
5 loops, best of 3: 4.63 s per loop
```

and after `L._hasse_diagram._precompute_intervals()`

```
sage: timeit("list(L._hasse_diagram.congruences_iterator())")
5 loops, best of 3: 656 ms per loop
```

OTOH this will eat memory.

Currently this feature is well hidden, only available as a `_`-function of a `_`-variable. Later we should think about interface. A global "save-cpu-eat-memory" -switch or "aux functions" to lattices (posets?) or something else?

I consider Hasse diagrams not as part of the true API, but an implementation detail of posets. So I don't see any problem with changing the output type. Although it is part of the API for `HasseDiagram`, thus, it technically is a backwards incompatible change.

Also, it might be faster to have the `dict` indexed by a pair `(x,y)` as it only needs to do 1 hash and table lookup instead of 2. Also, a better way to populate `_intervals`:

```
self._intervals = {u: {v: v_up[u].intersection(v_down[v]) for v in range(n)}
                   for u in range(n)}
```
There is no need to create the empty object and you save a lot of Python calls by doing the dict comprehension.

Actually, even faster should be a list of lists, that needs no lookup at all.

> There is no need to create the empty object and you save a lot of Python calls by doing the dict comprehension.

True. I was thinking about lists but then somehow ended up to dict in this PoC.

And now the most important:

> I consider Hasse diagrams not as part of the true API, but an implementation detail of posets. So I don't see any problem with changing the output type.

OK. I tested by adding precomputing to `__init__` of poset. Only errors I got from long test of `combinat/posets` where from `.open_interval` in `posets.py`. But I think currently intervals are given as in the linear extension order, and that is propably a good thing.

If you want even more speed:

```
I've seen using list comprehension have a significant effect for things like this because of the extra Python overhead.

I do not like the documentation of `_alt_interval`. It should explain what it is doing (well, really it should be similar/same as `interval`. Moreover, you should put somewhere in some documentation about this feature and how to use it. It probably is good to make this part of the API for posets somewhere with a warning about the memory usage.

You also should update the ticket description.

Much more speedup should be possible with better algorithm: an interval from `a` with covers `a1` and `a2` to `b` is union of intervals `(a1, b)` and `(a2, b)`.

First, a technical question: A Python function can return an internal function, i.e. this will print "Hello":

```
def f():
    def g(): print("Hello")
    return g
f()()
```

Would it be meaningfull to use this feature, and remove `_alt_interval` from the top level of Hasse diagram?

Now to the main question.

The problem is, IMO, `UniqueRepresentation`. No created poset will ever be freed from the memory, and so making test with random posets will eventually eat all the memory. And if we compute `lequal_matrix()` or `_meet` etc, those will be saved too. That's why I am worried about this.

When should this precomputing be called? In `interval()`? In `congruence()`? In, say, `is_isoform()`?

I will formulate longer description for `_atl_interval`.

I do not think so by default because of how much memory this would use. Although it could be something we do for small posets (less that 5 vertices?).

That should not be true. Once you delete all references to a poset, it should be freeable as it is a weak reference (otherwise it is a memory leak bug).

> When should this precomputing be called? In `interval()`? In `congruence()`? In, say, `is_isoform()`?

Probably in none of these places, but instead we should document it as an alternative method for increasing the speed.

If that would be true, then for example this should print the same number again and again:

```
i = 0
j = 0
for P in Posets(8):
    j += 1
    if j % 1000 == 0:
        print(sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage())
    if P.is_connected():
        i += 1
print(i)
```

(Compare this with same except `digraphs(8)` instead of `Posets(8)`.)

Currently there is no way to for example search for counter-example with random posets to unlimited time.

I know `UniqueRepresentation` is a weak cache, and I do not see anything that would explicitly nail it in the memory. What is probably happening is with the iterator populating the cache and moving around all of the memory is not giving the garbage collector time to work. If I force a garbage collection, then the memory usage (basically) does not grow:

```python
import gc
i = 0
j = 0
for P in Posets(8):
    j += 1
    if j % 100 == 0:
        gc.collect()
        print(sage.misc.getusage.get_memory_usage())
    if P.is_connected():
        i += 1
print(i)
```
IIRC, Python will force a garbage collection to see if it can free up the memory before giving an out-of-memory exception. Although I've never really done anything that would cause that to happen.

The problem is propably memory overcommit or usage of every bit of memory. When almost every byte is used, Linux is extremely slow, and so never goes to the limit where Python would give out-of-memory exception.

This should be handled in Python level or in OS level. Sage can only add some temporary workarounds.
