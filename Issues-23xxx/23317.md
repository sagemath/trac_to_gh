I know nothing about `Poset`, but this is a side effect of the first `word` of your list

```
sage: print V
[word: , word: 1, word: 2, word: 11, word: 21, word: 12, word: 111, word: 22, word: 211, word: 121, word: 112, word: 1111]
sage: P = Poset((V, lambda x,y: _covers_P(y, x)))
sage: H = P.hasse_diagram()
sage: print H.vertices()
SystemError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
...
SystemError: NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
sage:
sage: V.pop(0)
word: 
sage: P = Poset((V, lambda x,y: _covers_P(y, x)))
sage: H = P.hasse_diagram()
sage: print H.vertices()
[word: 1, word: 11, word: 111, word: 1111, word: 112, word: 12, word: 121, word: 2, word: 21, word: 211, word: 22]
```
Don't know how to fix that.
