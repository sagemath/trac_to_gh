Define that a module (or vector space) is `True` iff it is not the zero space. In other words:

```
sage: bool(QQ^0)
False
sage: bool(QQ^1)
True
```

This could be useful in constructions like

```
if M.right_kernel():
    ...
```

If the base ring is the zero ring (obtained by `Integers(1)`, for example), then any free module should return `False`. Certainly this should be the case if you want to set `__nonzero__ = __bool__`.

I'm not convinced. I define `__bool__` to mean "has positive dimension", which is more useful than "contains a non-zero element". Checking for the base ring seems like useless nitpicking to me.

Of course, there is some friction between the programming aspect and the mathematical aspect here. It's not clear to me whether "rank" is even well-defined (at least, it is not true that R<sup>k</sup> has rank k if R is the zero ring). From a programming point of view, the rank is perfectly well-defined as whatever the `rank()` method returns.

I disagree with the following, from the mathematical point of view:

```
sage: R = Integers(1)

Every free module over the zero ring should be zero (hence equal to every other free module), since it only has one element, 0. So I agree that mathematically, rank is not defined. I think the Sage code should actually reflect this: probably `M2.rank()` should raise an error.

As I said later in that comment.

When I dealt with the initial implementation of simplicial complexes, I had to deal with a number of bugs involving `0 x n` or `n x 0` matrices. I feel like the same thing is going to happen here: someone is going to start producing free modules over the zero ring and expect `M == 0` to return `True` for them, or `bool(M)` to return `False`, and it won't.

You say that this is "useless nitpicking", but I don't understand the resistance to the small change from

```
return bool(self.rank())
```
to something like

```
return not self.ring().is_zero() and bool(self.rank())
```
Are you worried about speed? Or something else?

I simply don't argee that `Integers(1)^4` should be considered `False`.

The problem is that we are considering two different definitions of `bool(M)` here:

1. (math) a free module M is `True` if and only if M contains a non-zero element.

2. (comp sci) a free module M is `True` if and only if the rank of M is positive.

I consider the second definition more useful and simpler.

Simpler because it requires checking just one condition. And whenever I see two ways to do something and the difference in behaviour is very small, I almost always go for the simplest solution. If you want to add extra complexity like checking for the zero ring, there needs to be a good reason.

Also more useful because I consider it a *feature* that `Integers(1)^0` and `Integers(1)^3` are different (contrary to your earlier comment about `==`). So treating them differently in `bool()` increases the information content of `bool(M)`.
