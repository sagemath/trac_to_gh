I don't think the change proposed is disastrous either, so if there's another reviewer who thinks the proposed change really does provide an improvement, I won't argue.

The easiest way to accomplish integration into cython is probably just to generate a pull request to include these definitions into `site-packages/Cython/Includes/cpython/dict.pxd`.

It'll be relatively complicated, because Cython tries to generate C-code that can be compiled against `Py2` as well as `Py3` and they are fundamentally incompatible for this.

Yes, I understand. I think moving those to cython would be fine. 

The problem with the structs is that these are incompatible between Py2/Py3 and that code for one will not compile on the other. And I'm not sure that taking the union of the two on the cython level is the best way to handle (hide) this incompatibility. I also don't think sage is a great testing ground for Py2/Py3 compatibility just yet, because it doesn't really get compiled on Py3 yet.

My main concern is that this module, because it implements relatively dangerous stuff, is not an appropriate testing ground either.

It just looks wrong to me because the struct definition is not a subset of the fields available (not on Py2 and not on Py3), and there's a struct definition that is not available on Py3.
