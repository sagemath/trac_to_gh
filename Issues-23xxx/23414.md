The main reason is to eventually move those to Cython itself. Usually, Cython upstream welcomes additional declarations regarding the CPython API.

However, it is a bit that is dependent on Py2/Py3.

OK. The part of the API that gets exposed is indeed part of what `Python.h` publishes. However, it is a bit that is dependent on Py2/Py3. Currently, the header file basically publishes the union, leaving it to the C compiler afterwards to raise an error in case of a python version mismatch. So code that includes this header file needs to guard on Py2/Py3.

On the other hand, the file backports `PyDict_GetItemWithError`, which works towards writing code that is Py2/Py3 agnostic.

Furthermore, the main purpose of this module is to provide a function that is badly bound to unpublished implementation details of dictionaries. As far as I know, the routine provided here is only a good idea for an improved implementation of `WeakValueDict`. So its `pxd` would ideally only include `del_dictitem_by_exact_value`, so that people only create dependencies on this module if they really need to.

I'm a little hesitant to name this a good API choice. Since this ticket is only about refactoring, I think we only want to merge it if it actually improves the API and the reasons above make me doubt that.

I don't think the change proposed is disastrous either, so if there's another reviewer who thinks the proposed change really does provide an improvement, I won't argue.

The easiest way to accomplish integration into cython is probably just to generate a pull request to include these definitions into `site-packages/Cython/Includes/cpython/dict.pxd`.

It'll be relatively complicated, because Cython tries to generate C-code that can be compiled against `Py2` as well as `Py3` and they are fundamentally incompatible for this.

Yes, I understand. I think moving those to cython would be fine. 

The problem with the structs is that these are incompatible between Py2/Py3 and that code for one will not compile on the other. And I'm not sure that taking the union of the two on the cython level is the best way to handle (hide) this incompatibility. I also don't think sage is a great testing ground for Py2/Py3 compatibility just yet, because it doesn't really get compiled on Py3 yet.

My main concern is that this module, because it implements relatively dangerous stuff, is not an appropriate testing ground either.
