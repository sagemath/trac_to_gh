A common pattern used in doctests is

```
S = tester.some_elements()
M = cartesian product of S
for x,y in tester.some_elements(M):
    check things
```
Sometimes we need to set `max_runs` to make this product not get too big (especially if it is more than two copies of S involved.)

The current implementation of some_elemnts() then just takes the first few elements of the product. This is unfortunate because it means that we are not testing an interesting subset of the product.

You want some magic code that can tell what objects are interesting. Instead you should just actually better use `some_elements`. I think the goal of this is impossible and there are tangible, good solutions. Thus we should close this as invalid.
