This is a followup on #14878. On the Sage commandline `sin(x*sin(x*sin(x*sin(x)))).series(x,12)` takes only about 100 microseconds; when doctesting in most of attempts it takes two hundred seconds (regardless of parallel or not). This possibly means changing memory content influences a computation.

While it influences patchbot time only atm (adds about 0.4% to overall CPU time) it's a serious cumulative waste, and it points to a hiding bug.

Component: **performance**

Interestingly with the #22959 branch the behaviour changes, at least here. So file content changes memory content which (presumably) changes behaviour.
