<div id="comment:0"></div>

The conversion of number field elements to real interval field is slow (that was actually the main reason for the slowness constated in #23388). We implement a function `cdef void nf_elem_get_mpfi(mpfi_t x, NumberFieldElement a, mp_prec_t prec)` that provides an interval approximation of a number field element. We then refactorize the methods `floor()` and `_richcmp_()` and provide a straightforward implementation of `_real_mpfi_()`.

This improves the overall performance of any method of number field element using approximation.

Depends on #23402
