When `src/bin/sage-env-config` was added, the `make misc-clean` target was modified to remove it.  However, this breaks an otherwise working Sage install.  Most of the other files removed by `make misc-clean` is build/configure cruft not needed at runtime, whereas `src/bin/sage-env-config` is needed to set `$SAGE_LOCAL` properly in the `sage` script.

This broke building the Docker images.
