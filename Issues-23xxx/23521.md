# Issue 23521: Morphisms in a category different from their domain/codomain should print as maps

sage: GF(3).coerce_map_from(Zp(3)).section()
Lifting morphism:
  From: Finite Field of size 3
  To:   3-adic Ring with capped relative precision 20
```
This string representation is misleading, since both domain and codomain are rings, but the lifting map is in the category of sets.  I propose that we change `_repr_` for `Morphism` to check whether the category of the morphism is the same as the meet of the categories of the domain and codomain.  If so, print `morphism`, and otherwise, print `map`.
