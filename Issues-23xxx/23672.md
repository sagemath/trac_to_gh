As discussed in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/b1pWen3lrKA, the documentation of Fourier series as implemented in piecewise-defined functions needs some improvement. This ticket provides it, as well as a simplification of the user interface: the half-period is now an optional argument; if not provided, it is inferred from the domain of the piecewise-defined function:

```
sage: f = piecewise([((0, 2*pi), cos(x))]) 
sage: f.fourier_series_cosine_coefficient(1)  # results in TypeError in Sage 8.0
1
sage: f.fourier_series_cosine_coefficient(1, pi)  # compatible with Sage 8.0
1
```
The ticket also corrects two bugs:
- computation of Fourier coefficients when the domain width does not coincide with the period:

```
sage: f = piecewise([((0, 4*pi), cos(x))])
sage: f.fourier_series_cosine_coefficient(1, pi)  # yields 2 in Sage 8.0
1
```
- despite what it claimed, the method `fourier_series_partial_sum` did not return *S<sub>N</sub>(x)* but *S<sub>N-1</sub>(x)* (this is because the summation was governed by `srange(1, N)` instead of `srange(1, N+1)`); we have now

```
sage: f = piecewise([((0, 2*pi), cos(x))])
sage: f.fourier_series_partial_sum(1, pi)  # yields 0 in Sage 8.0
cos(x)
```
