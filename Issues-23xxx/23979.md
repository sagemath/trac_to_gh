Do you know why `setrlimit()` does not work? Is it a Python problem or a Cygwin problem?

I'd like to understand why it doesn't work and check that condition instead of blindly ignoring exceptions. Or, if that doesn't work, only ignore the exception on Cygwin.

I could raise an exception if not on Cygwin.  It just seems to me though like something that *should* fail quietly, or at most with a warning.  It shouldn't just crash the test runner if `setrlimit()` fails for some reason.

This is only for the doctester, not for running Sage itself. When testing, it is fair to be more strict. You typically want to know when something goes wrong, even if that thing is rather innocent.

So yes, I would be happier to ignore the exception only on Cygwin.

Right but what I'm saying is the behavior of setting the memory limit to 3300 MB is pretty arbitrary and not something most people running the doctester is even going to be aware is happening, so if for some reason it fails it's not very nice if the doctester just crashes.

Another thing that's unfortunate is that there's no way to distinguish a `ValueError` when passing an unsupported limit, versus a `ValueError` when the limits themselves are invalid for some reason.  It's not the best interface.

Well, we can try squelching it just in Cygwin for now.  I'll be curious to see if this causes problems on any other platforms. Perhaps it won't.
