Do you know why `setrlimit()` does not work? Is it a Python problem or a Cygwin problem?

So yes, I would be happier to ignore the exception only on Cygwin.

Well, we can try squelching it just in Cygwin for now.  I'll be curious to see if this causes problems on any other platforms. Perhaps it won't.
