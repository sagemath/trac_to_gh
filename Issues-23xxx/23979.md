Do you know why `setrlimit()` does not work? Is it a Python problem or a Cygwin problem?

Another thing that's unfortunate is that there's no way to distinguish a `ValueError` when passing an unsupported limit, versus a `ValueError` when the limits themselves are invalid for some reason.  It's not the best interface.

Well, we can try squelching it just in Cygwin for now.  I'll be curious to see if this causes problems on any other platforms. Perhaps it won't.
