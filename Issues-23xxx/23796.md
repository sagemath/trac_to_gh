This makes a few changes to Sage to allow it to be compatible with both PARI stable 2.9.3, as well as PARI git master (see #23544).

With "compatible", I mean that Sage builds and that all doctests are mathematically correct. So, doctests might fail but only because one correct answer is replaced by a different correct answer.

The main change is one call to `ellwp()`, where the current PARI version returns a value which is a factor 2 too small. Interestingly, Sage compensates for this by using a wrong formula later, to get correct results anyway.
