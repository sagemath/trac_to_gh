A comparison for FpT_Polyring_section and FpT_Fp_section objects needs to be implemented. This becomes apparent when comparing the object with an pickled/unpickled version. This has been temporarily addressed by skipping the pickling step in the doctest.

Look at the FpT_Polyring_section and FpT_Fp_section classes in rings/fraction_field_FpT.pyx

```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[]
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: f = R.convert_map_from(K); f
Section map:
  From: Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field of size 5
  To:   Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Finite Field of size 5
sage: type(f)
<type 'sage.rings.fraction_field_FpT.FpT_Polyring_section'>
      
sage: fprime = loads(dumps(f))
sage: fprime == f
False
```
