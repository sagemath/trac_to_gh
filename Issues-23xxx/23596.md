<div id="comment:4" align="right">comment:4</div>

There is something strange happening when re-installing GLPK 4.60 (the current version in Sage) after installing 4.63. The libraries look like this:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer      17 Aug 11 14:19 local/lib/libglpk.so -> libglpk.so.40.1.0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer      17 Aug 11 14:19 local/lib/libglpk.so.40 -> libglpk.so.40.2.2
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 3592384 Aug 11 14:19 local/lib/libglpk.so.40.1.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jdemeyer jdemeyer 3626448 Aug  8 20:45 local/lib/libglpk.so.40.2.2
```
Note how both versions are installed and how `local/lib/libglpk.so.40` points to the *new* version instead of the old.

This leads to doctest failures because the *new* version is still used by Sage.

Since this might mask other problems, I am unsetting positive_review until this is clarified.

Yes, this is curious. Is there anything interesting in your log of glpk-4.60 when you downgrade? It may be a quirk from libtool, but we can deal with that with a removal of old libraries first.

Going back to this one. We cannot make `glpk-4.60` behave retro-actively. But we can prevent the problem to happen again in the future.

I have suspicions other libtool packages may behave the same way. Apart from future proofing at the spkg level, Erik's work in #22509 is probably the only thing that will enable a working downgrade path for that case. Again all this is for future improvements.

That's the error you would get if the patch to `sage/numerical/backends/glpk_backend.pyx` is not applied. So for that one at least, it looks like something didn't apply cleanly. 

Could we have some access to errors on 32bits?

I cannot reproduce this on `arando` (32-bit Linux). Could you please try again, if you are running out of disk space, maybe that could explain why stuff breaks too.

I follwed the [manual_git.html](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/manual_git.html#chapter-manual-git) page and got the following (git is not my friend).

```
confetti:sage dcoudert$  git fetch trac 30c496f
fatal: Couldn't find remote ref 30c496f
confetti:sage dcoudert$ git fetch trac 30c496fb7ab510df7b0a88e0ccae3050799ebdc6
confetti:sage dcoudert$ git checkout -b my_branch FETCH_HEAD
fatal: Cannot update paths and switch to branch 'my_branch' at the same time.
Did you intend to checkout 'FETCH_HEAD' which can not be resolved as commit?
```

Anyway, I don't have access to a 32bit machine. So I don't know how to test and help solving the issue.
