Same as #22001, but for relative number field homsets.

This causes for example

```
sage: K.<a,b> = NumberField([x^2+1, x^2+2])
sage: H = Hom(K,K)
sage: loads(dumps(H)) is H
False
```

It would be nice if `is_NumberFieldHomsetCodomain` took the category as an argument.  But I think that can wait until another ticket.
