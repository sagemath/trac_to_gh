Just like `.factor` can call `._factor_univariate_polynomial`, `.is_irreducible` should be able to call `._is_irreducible_univariate_polynomial`.

Before:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: f = R.random_element(degree=10)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
10 loops, best of 3: 21.6 ms per loop
```

After:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQbar[]
sage: f = R.random_element(degree=1000)
sage: %timeit f.is_irreducible()
The slowest run took 18.76 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 2.3 us per loop
```
