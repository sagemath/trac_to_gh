We can now `cdef` the class `LieAlgebraElement` since #22632 is merged. This also does some other fixes to `__mul__` to better handle `int` input and to `lift` to handle when the UEA has a different indexing set or is the PBW basis.

Depends on #23404

Just commenting on the Cython code in `lie_algebra_element.pyx`:

1. You are cimporting various things that you don't actually use. I assume that this was for some earlier failed experiment?

2. Is there any reason that `self` should have a `lift()` method? Remember that arithmetic in Cython is different from Python: you cannot assume that `self` is an instance of the class.

Maybe an analogy in a less specialized area of math would be when you do `x + y` with two (multiplicative) group elements, then it would automatically coerce into the corresponding group algebras. (I'm not saying this is a feature we want, but merely would be the same concept).

Continuing your analogy, it seems that your input is really one group element and one other object which could be anything. Since it really could be anything, you shouldn't force the Sage coercion model on it.

What's wrong with something like

```
def __mul__(left, right):
    # ...
    # handle base ring stuff first
    # ...
    if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
        left = left.lift()   # Or (<LieAlgebraElement>left).lift() if lift is cpdef
    if isinstance(right, LieAlgebraElement):
        right = right.lift()
    return left * right
```

True, well, I want to assume that the other one is something coercible into a group element. So I need to invoke the coercion model at some point. Although I guess I can let the coercion model do its thing via `+` once I lift up the group element.

In this case, LBYL is better than EAFP. You are doing `isinstance()` checks anyway, so you really already know whether to use `__mul__` or `__rmul__`.

For example, the old code

```
        if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
            self = <LieAlgebraElement> left
            y = right
        else:
            self = <LieAlgebraElement> right
            y = left
        try:
            return super(LieAlgebraElement, self).__mul__(y)
        except TypeError:
            pass
```
could be rewritten as

```
        try:
            if isinstance(left, LieAlgebraElement):
                return super(LieAlgebraElement, left).__mul__(right)
            else:
                return super(LieAlgebraElement, right).__rmul__(left)
        except TypeError:
            pass
```

Really, I think Cython should let `Element.__mul__(left, right)` work since it makes no assumptions on the type of `Foo.__mul__(left, right)`. I would almost consider this to be a bug in Cython because of that.

It's not a Cython issue but a Python issue. I understand the confusion because

```
cdef class Element:
    def __mul__(left, right):
        ...
```
looks like it is providing `Element.__mul__` but that isn't actually the case. In Cython, the syntax `def __mul__(left, right)` is used to define the `nb_multiply` function in the `PyTypeObject` structure. Python (not Cython) then adds `__mul__` and `__rmul__` attributes which call the `nb_multiply` function implementated by Cython.

Maybe it's easier to understand with `__richcmp__` on the one hand and `__eq__`, `__lt__`, ... on the other hand. `__richcmp__` is just Cython syntax, there is no actual method called `__richcmp__`. But Python does generate `__eq__`, ... methods from this.

Thinking about it, you *could* actually call `nb_multiply` directly from Cython. But that would not qualify as a clean solution.

I don't really understand your question. But let me try to clarify anyway. Consider

```
cdef class Foo:
    def __mul__(left, right):
        pass
```
Now, this `def __mul__` is not a Python method or function or anything like that. It's really a C function to put in the `nb_multiply` slot. Cython chose the syntax `def __mul__` because it would be familiar to Python programmers, but the similar syntax hides the difference in what it really is.

Now, when a type(*) is initialized by Python, ordinary Python attributes `__mul__` and `__rmul__` are generated from the slots like `nb_multiply`. These attributes are of type "slot wrapper" and you can see them in the `__dict__`:

```
sage: Integer.__mul__
<slot wrapper '__mul__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>
sage: Integer.__rmul__
<slot wrapper '__rmul__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>
sage: Integer.__dict__
dict_proxy({'__abs__': <slot wrapper '__abs__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__add__': <slot wrapper '__add__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__and__': <slot wrapper '__and__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__array_interface__': <attribute '__array_interface__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__copy__': <method '__copy__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            '__div__': <slot wrapper '__div__' of 'sage.rings.integer.Integer' objects>,
            .......
```
These behave mostly like ordinary methods. They are implemented by Python and call the underlying slot function, which is `nb_multiply` for both `__mul__` and `__rmul__`.

In other words, the Python code `cls.__mul__(left, right)` roughly translates to `cls->nb_multiply(left, right)` in C, *with extra checking* added (like ordinary methods, the first argument `self` should be a suitable type). Now what I propose is to have a special function

```
def wrapperdescr_call_nocheck(slotwrapper, *args)
```
which would call the underlying slot function but *without checks*.

I haven't actually tried if it would work, but it should. And I can imagine it being useful for other purposes too. This might turn out to be one of these things where, if you know that it exists, you start seeing lots of use cases.

You might think that the problem could also be solved by implementing a custom `__mul__` method-like attribute on the type(*), which would be like the standard `__mul__` slot wrapper, except that it would not check that the first argument is of the right type. That sounds good, but breaks when subtyping(*): Python insists on "restoring" the slot wrapper in the subtype(*). I know because this broke an earlier attempt of #23102.

(*) "type" and "class" mean the same thing in Python. However, there is a tendency to use "type" when talking about Python internals but "class" when talking about user code. The only exception are old-style classes, which are not types: indeed, `type(obj)` is not the same as `obj.__class__` for instances of old-style classes.

Rebased. Thank you for adding the function. Although this does result in a slowdown in some of the operations:

```

```
The multiplication of elements in the Lie algebra should be a rare event and is mainly used as a convenience (the better way is to do the lift within the code itself). I also would say multiplying by an `int` should not really be done either.

TL;DR - I can live with the 5-10% regression for the typical multiplication cases in order to have cleaner code.

I can think of 2 reasons for the slowdown:

1. The method access `IndexedFreeModuleElement.__mul__` takes some time. You could do this at the top-level like

```
cdef object IndexedFreeModuleElement__mul__ = IndexedFreeModuleElement.__mul__
```

2. You are constructing `{}` for every call of `wrapperdescr_fastcall`. Since this `kwds` argument is not actually used, you could pass `None` instead.
