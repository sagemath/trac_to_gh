Does not work for me: having pulled the ticket branch into Sage 8.1.beta0 and run make, I still get blank boxes in the *Three.js JavaScript WebGL Renderer* section of the reference manual.
Besides, if I open directly the file `src/doc/en/reference/plot3d/threejs_examples/spheres.html` in my browser, I get a blank box as well.
