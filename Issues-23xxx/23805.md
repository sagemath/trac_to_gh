This is part of meta ticket #23047. The goal is to have scheme points able to be coerced when that coercion makes sense. Essentially SchemeHomeset_points needs a `_coerce_map_from_` function and possibly updates to `_element_constructor_`.

For example, we should be able to coerce between the following objects

- the same space type where the base rings have a coercion between them. i.e. P<sup>1</sup>(ZZ) -> P<sup>1</sup>(QQ)

- a points of a subscheme to points of the ambient space

- base ring elements to Affine 1 space.

I ran some functionality tests, the following examples should give true, but don't:

```
PQ.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
PC.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
PQ([1,0])==PC([1,0]) , PC(CC).has_coerce_map_from(PQ(QQ))
```

and

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
A1.<x> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
A2.<x> = AffineSpace(K,1)
p1 = A1(1)
p2 = A2(1)
p1==p2 , A2(K).has_coerce_map_from(A1(QQ))

I reviewed the code and I tried some rather sophisticated examples (couple of examples below), wasn't able to find any problems Looks good to me. 

```python
sage: R.<X> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(X^2 - 2, embedding=QQbar(sqrt(2)))
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 1)
sage: Q.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1) == Q(a,1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1)
(1.414213562373095? : 1)
sage: Q(a, 1)
(a : 1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1) == Q(a,1)
True
sage: P(QQbar).has_coerce_map_from(Q(K))
True
```
and

```python
sage: R.<t> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(t^2 - 6, embedding=QQbar(sqrt(6)))
sage: P.<x,y,z,w> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 3)
sage: X = P.subscheme(y^2*z - x*(x-z)*(x-w) ); X
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Algebraic Field defined by:
  -x^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2*w - x*z*w
sage: Y = P.subscheme([y^2*z - x*(x-z)*(x-w), w - 2*z]); Y
Closed subscheme of Projective Space of dimension 3 over Algebraic Field defined by:
  -x^3 + x^2*z + y^2*z + x^2*w - x*z*w,
