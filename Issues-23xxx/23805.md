This is part of meta ticket #23047. The goal is to have scheme points able to be coerced when that coercion makes sense. Essentially SchemeHomeset_points needs a `_coerce_map_from_` function and possibly updates to _element_constructor_.

For example, we should be able to coerce between the following objects

- the same space type where the base rings have a coercion between them. i.e. P<sup>1</sup>(ZZ) -> P<sup>1</sup>(QQ)

- a points of a subscheme to points of the ambient space

- base ring elements to Affine 1 space.

I ran some functionality tests, the following examples should give true, but don't:

```
PQ.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
PC.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(CC,1)
PQ([1,0])==PC([1,0]) , PC(CC).has_coerce_map_from(PQ(QQ))
```

and

```
R.<x> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
K.<i> = NumberField(x^2+1)
A1.<x> = AffineSpace(QQ,1)
A2.<x> = AffineSpace(K,1)
p1 = A1(1)
p2 = A2(1)
p1==p2 , A2(K).has_coerce_map_from(A1(QQ))
```

I reviewed the code and I tried some rather sophisticated examples (couple of examples below), wasn't able to find any problems Looks good to me. 

```python
sage: R.<X> = PolynomialRing(QQ)
sage: K.<a> = NumberField(X^2 - 2, embedding=QQbar(sqrt(2)))
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQbar, 1)
sage: Q.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(K, 1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1) == Q(a,1)
sage: P(sqrt(2),1)

sage: P(QQbar).has_coerce_map_from(Q(K))

and
