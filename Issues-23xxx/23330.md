A solution could be to use Jupyter's native rich output for LaTeX, not the Sage's mechanism through the IPython extension %display. For this, it suffices to implement the method `_repr_latex_` to all Sage objects, i.e. add the following to `SageObject`:

```
    def _repr_latex_(self):
        from sage.misc.latex import latex
        return '$' + str(latex(self)) + '$'
```
See e.g. [this presentation](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Custom%20Display%20Logic.ipynb) of Jupyter display logic.
This solves the pdf issue reported here.
