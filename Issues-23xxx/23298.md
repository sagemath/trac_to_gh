In [the doc](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/sage/repl/display/formatter.html) for formatter, there is a fairly cumbersome example (presumably for doctesting purposes), but really all that is needed by a typical user is

```
sage: %display ascii_art
```
So this should be made more clear.

Status: new

I noticed that [this](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/repl/sage/repl/ipython_extension.html#sage.repl.ipython_extension.SageMagics.display) is kind of what you are describing.

Would it be good to link to this? And / Or should it still be changed?

Removing the "beginner" tag from old tickets. Some could be returned to beginner-friendly status by adding a comment about what needs to be done. Some others might be easy for an experienced developer to finish.
