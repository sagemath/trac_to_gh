LGTM fundamentally, but why did you only change, e.g, `if len(error) > 0:` to `if len(error):` and not `if error:`?

oh, this len change is only a tiny side thing. No need to aim for perfection here, I hope.

This ticket is only a little preparation for switching our Expect interfaces to use unicode. This may be difficult, I have no idea.

Of course, but it is a while-we-are-at-it<sup>(tm)</sup> thing. :)

> This ticket is only a little preparation for switching our Expect interfaces to use unicode. This may be difficult, I have no idea.

We will just have to see. I think this is a good step forward. I'm going to wait to see if the patchbot comes back with any issues before setting a positive review (which you can do on my behalf), but I don't expect it too.
