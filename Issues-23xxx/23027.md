Alice writes

```
def fibonacci(i):
   """
   Return the `i`-th Fibonacci number
   """
   if i > 1:
       return fibonacci(i-1) * fibonacci(i-2)
   return [0, 1][i]
```

but when the code conflicts with Bob's commit, it is displayed as

```
def fibonacci(i):
   """
   Return the `i`-th Fibonacci number
   """
   if i > 1:
       return fibonacci(i-1) * fibonacci(i-2)
   return i
```

I think that were a conflict like this to actually happen, Alice's seed values wouldn't disappear like that.
