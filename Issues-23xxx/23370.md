However, the equality for `DivisorGroup_generic` is equivalent to that of its defining values, which `FormalSums` is a subclass of `UniqueRepresentation`. So it is better to let that handle equality checking and there does not seem to be a reasonable check for inequality. So I would still not add the decorator and instead just get rid of `__cmp__`. This also seems like it will not change the behavior from looking at the subclasses.",
