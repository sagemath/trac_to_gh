(*) I find "degree" a confusing name. Is this standard in Gauss­–Legendre integration theory? I would expect the degree to be one less than the number of nodes.

Frederic uses it in mpmath. He scales the parameter so that an increase roughly doubles the precision. I agree, though: it's much easier to document if you just give the degree of the legendre polynomials. It would be nice to use this routine as a drop-in replacement in sage's mpmath too.

<a id='comment:16'></a>Follow-up at #30698 to add this to the documentation.

I don't see it in the built documentation, web search engines
don't find "Gauss-Legendre" at doc.sagemath.org, and `search_doc`
gives nothing for "Gauss-Legendre" or "gauss_legendre".

If you know how to do that, please post a branch at #30698.
Otherwise I'll look into it.
