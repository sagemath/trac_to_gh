4. You use `cdef int` in various places. Only do this when you know that the variable must always be small. If there any tiny chance that this will ever be larger than `2^31`, use `cdef long` or some other type instead. Even if you cannot support Gauss-Legendre integration in "degree" `>= 31` now, there is no reason to a priori assume that it will never be needed.

5. In documentation, use `^` instead of `**`.

(*) I find "degree" a confusing name. Is this standard in Gauss­–Legendre integration theory? I would expect the degree to be one less than the number of nodes.

I tried and it generated errors for me (it got confused with complex numbers in a way that python's math doesn't). It's only used in a non-critical part (computing the initial value for newton iteration), so it doesn't need to be fast. The python library seems to work fine.

Thanks

Done

Good point.

Good point

Frederic uses it in mpmath. He scales the parameter so that an increase roughly doubles the precision. I agree, though: it's much easier to document if you just give the degree of the legendre polynomials. It would be nice to use this routine as a drop-in replacement in sage's mpmath too.

Follow-up at #30698 to add this to the documentation.

I don't see it in the built documentation, web search engines
don't find "Gauss-Legendre" at doc.sagemath.org, and `search_doc`
gives nothing for "Gauss-Legendre" or "gauss_legendre".

If you know how to do that, please post a branch at #30698.
Otherwise I'll look into it.
