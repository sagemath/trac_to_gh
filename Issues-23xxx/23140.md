4. You use `cdef int` in various places. Only do this when you know that the variable must always be small. If there any tiny chance that this will ever be larger than `2^31`, use `cdef long` or some other type instead. Even if you cannot support Gauss-Legendre integration in "degree" `>= 31` now, there is no reason to a priori assume that it will never be needed.

5. In documentation, use `^` instead of `**`.

(*) I find "degree" a confusing name. Is this standard in Gauss­–Legendre integration theory? I would expect the degree to be one less than the number of nodes.

I tried and it generated errors for me (it got confused with complex numbers in a way that python's math doesn't). It's only used in a non-critical part (computing the initial value for newton iteration), so it doesn't need to be fast. The python library seems to work fine.

Thanks

Done

> 4. You use `cdef int` in various places. Only do this when you know that the variable must always be small. If there any tiny chance that this will ever be larger than `2^31`, use `cdef long` or some other type instead.

Good point.

> 5. In documentation, use `^` instead of `**`.


Good point

Frederic uses it in mpmath. He scales the parameter so that an increase roughly doubles the precision. I agree, though: it's much easier to document if you just give the degree of the legendre polynomials. It would be nice to use this routine as a drop-in replacement in sage's mpmath too.

Follow-up at #30698 to add this to the documentation.

I don't see it in the built documentation, web search engines
don't find "Gauss-Legendre" at doc.sagemath.org, and `search_doc`
gives nothing for "Gauss-Legendre" or "gauss_legendre".

If you know how to do that, please post a branch at #30698.
Otherwise I'll look into it.
