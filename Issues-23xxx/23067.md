Usual reasons (working on an u-to-date R is a prerequisite to get answers from the R Core Team on r-help...)

The new upstream version has been released almost a month ago.

Upstream tarball : [https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.0.tar.gz](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.4.0.tar.gz)

I guess so. Did anything change upstream?

This installs cleanly on Debian testing and on Ubuntu-over-WSL, but fails to install on cygwin. Reason nunuderstandable (the installation of the recommended packages "stats" seems to need under Cygwin  a post-compilation step unneeded on Linux, which fails : rebasing needed ?)

Help needed from people knowing cygwin better than I do.

Also : no news from the Maoc OS X front (I don't have that in my zoo...), and Apple's shenanigans with SSL have caused trouble for R in the past...

Well for starters there's a bug in R here.  The `object 'vI' not found` is referring to a variable that is defined [here](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/R-3-4-branch/src/library/base/R/namespace.R#L375), in a branch that is not being entered because the "package.rds" file, whatever that is, doesn't exist.  There's even a comment that reads:

```
        ## Can we rely on the existence of R-ng 'nsInfo.rds' and
        ## 'package.rds'?
        ## No, not during builds of standard packages
        ## stats4 depends on methods, but exports do not matter
```

I don't fully know what that means, but we are in fact building a standard package (the "stats" package) so this file, apparently, isn't guaranteed to exist.  The fact that later code uses a variable that isn't guaranteed to be defined is a bug.

Why this is being a problem on Cygwin and not on other platforms I don't know.

Does this happen
a. on Cygwin only, or
b. on Linux also ?

I agree, the latter issue is a bug, as is the potentially undefined variable I mentioned earlier.

The other two issues seem to be Cygwin specific.  R is using `signaltstack` for its `SIGSEGV` handling, which Cygwin *does* support, but I haven't seen too many programs that use this, so it could be buggy.  That's sort of a tangential issue though--the real problem is the segfault itself, which I will investigate now.

Just checking that starting from a fresh VM, I can obtain a working system (and install a few dozen R packages I happen to use more or less constantly).

But I agree that's just kicking the tyres... I also think that a similar tyre-kicking might be useful on Macs.

NB : the deletion of "Reviewer" has been done by Trac, not by me ! Setting it back.
