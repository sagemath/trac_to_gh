Merged with #22989 (which `needs_review`, BTW), passes `ptestlong` with the usual transient failure `sage -t --long src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py  # 1 doctest failed`, which passes when run standalone.

Note : I am not sure that we are still justified to keep `patches/libcurl_https_support.patch`, which drops upstream's requirement of https support in libcurl.

This is unnecessary on Linux. I seem to remember that this was introduced to ease cygwin and/or OS/X compilation. Is that still the case ?

I guess so. Did anything change upstream?
I cannot see anything relevant in the changelog.

This installs cleanly on Debian testing and on Ubuntu-over-WSL, but fails to install on cygwin. Reason nunuderstandable (the installation of the recommended packages "stats" seems to need under Cygwin  a post-compilation step unneeded on Linux, which fails : rebasing needed ?)

==> `needs_work`

Help needed from people knowing cygwin better than I do.

Also : no news from the Maoc OS X front (I don't have that in my zoo...), and Apple's shenanigans with SSL have caused trouble for R in the past...

Neither do I. ISTR that I *thought* it might be a rebasing problem, but I can't remember how I went to this guess, nor what was its rationale...

Well for starters there's a bug in R here.  The `object 'vI' not found` is referring to a variable that is defined [here](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/R-3-4-branch/src/library/base/R/namespace.R#L375), in a branch that is not being entered because the "package.rds" file, whatever that is, doesn't exist.  There's even a comment that reads:

```
        ## Can we rely on the existence of R-ng 'nsInfo.rds' and
        ## 'package.rds'?
        ## No, not during builds of standard packages
        ## stats4 depends on methods, but exports do not matter
```

I don't fully know what that means, but we are in fact building a standard package (the "stats" package) so this file, apparently, isn't guaranteed to exist.  The fact that later code uses a variable that isn't guaranteed to be defined is a bug.

Why this is being a problem on Cygwin and not on other platforms I don't know.

Does this happen

Just checking that starting from a fresh VM, I can obtain a working system (and install a few dozen R packages I happen to use more or less constantly).

But I agree that's just kicking the tyres... I also think that a similar tyre-kicking might be useful on Macs.

NB : the deletion of "Reviewer" has been done by Trac, not by me ! Setting it back.
