I mentioned this idea in [this ticket](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/23160#comment:8), but to summarize the purpose of this is to make the `spkg-install` scripts (as well as `spkg-build` and `spkg-check` when they exist) not directly executable on their own outside of package build directories.  This is to prevent them from being accidentally executed in any other context.  Further, they are wrapped to source the `sage-env` script from the `$SAGE_ROOT` the package is being installed into.  So if one manually enters a package build directory and runs the `spkg-install` it will automatically ensure that the correct Sage environment is loaded.

This obviates the need for the guard boilerplate that checks for `$SAGE_LOCAL`, though it can't hurt to keep, in case `sage-env` itself is broken somehow.

This ticket changes a ton of files, so let me just summarize the changes briefly:

* Modifies `sage-spkg` to write a wrapper containing the boilerplate around each `sage-build/install/check` script *after* it is copied into a package build directory.

* For all existing `sage-build/install/check` scripts, the executable bit is removed from the copies in the source tree in `build/pkgs/`, and the shebang lines are removed.

* For the handful of scripts that were written in Python, the `spkg-install` becomes just `exec sage-python23 sage-install.py`, where the original Python-based install script is moved to `sage-install.py`.

I think it would be good to do something like this, but it's just an idea and not strictly required for any future work.

I don't really like this idea.

1. Having those scripts executable can be useful for debugging.

2. I would still want to keep the check `if [ "$SAGE_LOCAL" = "" ]; then` (possibly in a different form) to guard against accidental execution outside of a Sage shell. This is important, since there can be severe consequences if `$SAGE_LOCAL` is not set.

3. Too much magic makes the logic harder to understand.

In any case, checking `$SAGE_LOCAL` isn't always completely sufficient either, to prevent unwanted side-effects.  What I'm proposing I believe is a lot safer because it discourages execution of these scripts outside of the appropriate context.

Well, other packaging systems aren't written in a very fragile language like `bash` :-)

Anyway, let me reconsider this ticket. I am starting to understand better why it's useful.

True, but as far as I can tell the problem here is not that what language the packaging system itself, however you define that, is written in.

The way I see it, on most systems, the danger of accidentally installing outside SAGE_LOCAL is mitigated by permissions--you wouldn't be running these scripts with `sudo`.  And if you *are* doing anything with `sudo` it sort of becomes your responsibility what happens.

I think at the end of the day this makes our scripts *safer* because they are no executable by default (if you really wanted to you could still run them with `bash <filename>`), and the wrapped scripts will always source the correct sage-env for the Sage that you're installing into.

If you really want to make the `spkg-install` script be usable outside of a Sage shell, starting with a `cd` statement into the correct directory would be good too. Otherwise you get\n\n```\n$ /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/patch-2.7.5/spkg-install \n/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/patch-2.7.5/spkg-install: line 45: ./configure: No such file or directory\nError configuring GNU patch\n```\n\n3. `grep -q -x -m 1`: I have some doubts about the portability of these options.

1. Instead of this:

```
if [ -f "/usr/local/src/sage-config/src/bin/sage-env" ]; then
    . "/usr/local/src/sage-config/src/bin/sage-env"
else
    echo >&2 "Error: sage-env not found; is /usr/local/src/sage-config the correct SAGE_ROOT?"
    exit 1
fi
```
I would prefer something more like

```
source "/usr/local/src/sage-config/src/bin/sage-env"
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: failed to source sage-env; is /usr/local/src/sage-config the correct SAGE_ROOT?"
    exit 1
fi
```
At the very least, you need to check for errors when sourcing `sage-env`.

2. If you really want to make the `spkg-install` script be usable outside of a Sage shell, starting with a `cd` statement into the correct directory would be good too. Otherwise you get

```
$ /usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/patch-2.7.5/spkg-install 
/usr/local/src/sage-config/local/var/tmp/sage/build/patch-2.7.5/spkg-install: line 45: ./configure: No such file or directory
Error configuring GNU patch
```

3. `grep -q -x -m 1`: I have some doubts about the portability of these options. GNU grep may have them, but we should support other `grep` implementations too.

4. For readability, assign `".tmp-$script"` to a variable: `tmpscript=".tmp-$script"`.

5. In `sage-spkg`, there is a check for a `spkg-install` implemented in Python. That is obsolete now.

if [ 0 -ne 0 ]; then
    echo >&2 "Error: failed to source sage-env; is /opt/sage/sage-test the correct SAGE_ROOT?"

cd "/opt/sage/sage-test/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pari-2.9.2.p2"

I wonder why you don't use a here document for this:

```
cat <<EOF

That way, there would no need to quote `"`.

This breaks old-style packages:

```
$ ./sage -p cluster_seed
Found package cluster_seed in /opt/sage/sage-test/upstream/cluster_seed-1.0.spkg
cluster_seed-1.0
====================================================

************************************************************************
spkg-install should not be marked executable in the                 build/pkgs directory
************************************************************************

explaining the problem and including the log file
  /opt/sage/sage-test/logs/pkgs/cluster_seed-1.0.log

************************************************************************
```

Now I see two solutions to this: either you need to bypass the boilerplate stuff from this ticket for old-style packages, or we need to drop support for old-style packages completely.

I will write to sage-devel to ask opinions about the latter.

Minor note: this causes excessive whitespace:

```
            msg="spkg-$script should not be marked executable in the \
                build/pkgs directory"
```
I would just put this on one line.

Yeah, I actually wasn't sure what this would do with "old style" packages. I figured if someone cared they would point it out.  I've just never actually *seen* one of these old-style packages and wouldn't know where to find one.

I'd be all for removing support entirely, but obviously that should be a separate issue.  In the meantime I make exceptions for them.

I agree. I think it suffices to mention in the docs how to support a Python install script using `sage-python23`.

I'm researching open package update tickets with patches that could conflict with this (specifically, those that update `spkg-install`--if they don't then there shouldn't be much conflict).

Tickets with positive review:
* #23023
* #23357

Tickets still needing work/review:
* #13268
* #13426
* #14645
* #15674
* #18197
* #18514
* #19680
* #19719
* #20922
* #21170
* #21525
* #21888
* #22072
* #23024
* #23325
* #23353

The following old tickets conflict with #20136 (or other more recent changes) and will need to be rebased anyways:
* #5310
* #10879
* #15209
* #15813
* #18749
* #19706
* #20670

Since tickets like this one (and #22509 + #22510) that make mass updates to packages are notoriously unwieldy it would be good to get merged quickly if/when it has a positive review.

To that end, I can make this depend on #23023 and #23357 since they already have positive review.  Of the tickets still needing work, it might be nice if some of them added this ticket as a dependency (especially #23325 and #23353 since they were opened later) but if they can be given a positive review quickly, I also have no problem adding them as dependencies to this ticket.  Most of the other tickets on that list either haven't been updated for several months, or are still in development, so I would prefer not to wait on them unless I hear otherwise.

There is no need for `$PKG_OLD_STYLE` since it is simply the negation of `$USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS`. So you can replace `[ -z "$PKG_OLD_STYLE" ]` by `[ "$USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS" = yes ]` and then you don't need the `PKG_OLD_STYLE` variable.

As far as I can see, there should be no conflict with #23357 (it does edit `spkg-install` but in a way that git should merge cleanly).

There *is* a conflict with #23023 since that actually adds a new package.

It's pretty explicit:

```
##################################################################
# Extract the package
##################################################################

if [ "$USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS" = yes ]; then
    # New-style package
    ...
else
    # Old-style package (deprecated)
    ...
fi
```

I'm -1 on adding a new variable just because you find that an existing variable has a confusing name. If you don't like the name `USE_LOCAL_SCRIPTS`, you can just change the name everywhere.
