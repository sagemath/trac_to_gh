Currently if one does something like

```
./sage -t --file-iterations=1000 src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/backend_normaliz.py
```

in order discover heisenbugs. One gets a timeout since the timeout for a doctest is on a per file bases. It would be much more reasonable to make the timeout on a per iteration basis, so that one does not need to provide a custom argument to `--timeout`.
