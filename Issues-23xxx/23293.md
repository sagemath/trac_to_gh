The bounding box seems to be wrong with the option `show(typeset='latex')`.  See [this ask.sagemath question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/38022/wrong-arrangement-of-latex-output-within-bounding-box-of-text-plot/) for more details.  Note that this probably only works when one has a local installation of LaTeX in the first place, so any doctest for a fix would need to be optional.
