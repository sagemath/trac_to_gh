Given a projective dynamical system defined over QQbar, when we compute the canonical height of a point, we first find a number field where the point and function are both defined. Unfortunately while the resultant of this map was normalized, its coordinates were not necessarily normalized. This resulted in errors like this:

```python
m=3
K.<v>=CyclotomicField(m)
P.<x,y>=ProjectiveSpace(K,1)
H=End(P)
f=DynamicalSystem_projective([3*y^2,-3*x^2])
f.is_post_critically_finite() # returns true 
f.change_ring(QQbar)
f.is_post_critically_finite() # returns false
```
The reason is that when the function is defined over K, and then changed to QQbar, it remains in the form (3x^2, -3y^2), but when the resultant is computed with normalize=True, we are really computing the resultant of (x<sup>2,-y</sup>2), which is what normalize_coordinates on f should have returned, but did not. As a result, when computing the local height of the critical points:

```python
P, Q = f.critical_points()
f.canonical_height(P) # returns log(3) = 1.0642806546472312635391438233
#when it should be 0
```
We fix this behavior by normalizing the coordinates of f after defining it over the appropriate number field. 

We also optimize a bit by checking if Wells' algorithm over QQ can be used *after* converting from QQbar to a number field, rather than *before* as it used to do.
