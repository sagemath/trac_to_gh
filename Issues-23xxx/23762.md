```
As discussed in #23758, the feature of `_add_variable_or_fallback` to do variable substitution seems unnecessarily complex.

All uses later in that module such as 

```
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_ETC',        opj('$SAGE_LOCAL', 'etc'))
```
can be replaced by simple use of Python variables (which all exist in the `sage.env` module)

```
_add_variable_or_fallback('SAGE_ETC',        opj(SAGE_LOCAL, 'etc'))
```
This also will have a clearer failure mode -- instead of leaving an unsubstituted $SAGE_LOCAL in a string if that variable is not set for some reason, an error will be raised.

I think the variable substitution scheme was introduced in #13432. I've asked there about its rationale: I don't want to remove this without trying to understand why it was introduced in the first place.

In the mean time, I have a branch which makes the change from strings to variables: `'$VAR' --> VAR`.
