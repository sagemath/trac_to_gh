After #22588, it is observed that there are wrong cross-references in the reference manual built incrementally (that is, not from scratch). This anomaly was not introduced by the patch at #22588, but rather the patch enables us to see it.

The problem of wrong cross-references seems related with how intersphinx extension works. A (partial) fix might be to update the intersphinx inventory files somehow when the auto-generated .rst files are updated.

I'm a little confused because of the chronological ordering of these tickets, but I think this general issue was fixed/worked around by #21044.  I'm confirming though...
