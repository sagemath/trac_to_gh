See [this post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-support/cGpJmhps3lI/UA6kgHAkAgAJ) for example and (some) justification.

Short story : calling `mathematica.Solve()` from Sage does work (and can solve some examples out of the reach of the current Sage's `solve()`), but the result can't be translated back to Sage.

It turns out that `mathematica.Solve()` returns (a vector or array of) Rule expression(s) (`variable -> expression`, meaning `Rule[variable, expression]` in Mathematica), which is currently not translated back to Sage.

In this case, I think that a "reasonable" translation is `variable == expression`, but I do not know Mathematica well enough to know if other translations, in other contexts, would be preferable...

Note that, in order to fully translate all `mathematica.Solve()` answers, we also need to translate the conditions that can be added to these solutions. This would need some conditional expression or operator, currently nonexistent in Sage. This is also true for some sympy answers, which use a similar system.

Since recently you can write 

```
sage: rel = x == cases(((x<0,exp(x)),(x>=0,2^x)))
sage: rel
x == cases(((x < 0, e^x), (x >= 0, 2^x)))
sage: rel.rhs().subs(x == -1)
e^(-1)
sage: rel.rhs().subs(x == 1)
2
```
This helps in constructing combined conditions. However it would be nice if one could express a condition using boolean notation. So this would benefit from such operators as well. For convenience I would propose functions with the same name as in SymPy:

```
In [28]: And(Eq(x,0), Eq(x,1))
Out[28]: x = 0 ∧ x = 1

In [29]: Or(Eq(x,0), Eq(x,1))
Out[29]: x = 0 ∨ x = 1

In [30]: Not(Eq(x,0))
Out[30]: x ≠ 0
```

Huh ? That doesn't work for me (in 8.1.beta6) :

```
sage: version
<function version at 0x7f0559248938>
sage: version()
'SageMath version 8.1.beta6, Release Date: 2017-09-21'
sage: rel = x == cases(((x<0,exp(x)),(x>=0,2^x)))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-7efd8dce6cab> in <module>()
----> 1 rel = x == cases(((x<Integer(0),exp(x)),(x>=Integer(0),Integer(2)**x)))

NameError: name 'cases' is not defined
```

Is that an optional or experimental package ?

Hmmm... Would you agree with :

```
def And(*args):
    return(reduce(lambda a,b:a and b, args, True)

def Or(*args):
    return(reduce(lambda a,b a or b, args, False)
```
