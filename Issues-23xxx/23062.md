The `disp` keyword of the top-level `minimize` function does not appear in the docstring. Moreover, it is currently set up to be verbose by default (don't think is a good idea), hence displays a message similar to:

```
Optimization terminated successfully.
         Current function value: 0.000000
         Iterations: 28
         Function evaluations: 35
         Gradient evaluations: 35
```

i'm seeking your opinion about: verbose mode by default yes or not?

as stated above, i'm +1 for no convergence message by default.

If you want to make `disp=False` the default, it should be done via the deprecation route, as it changes the output.

name `disp` comes  from the backend, it is not something we could change, it seems.

from that side i think it can be renamed inside `minimize`; it is a true/false flag that is passed to SciPy's optimize methods. 

(`fprime` has been renamed to `gradient`, for instance.) 

inside the numerical module, the `verbose` keyword is currently used in:

- interactive simplex method (`inject_variables`)
- `knapsack` problem

OTOH, `disp` is used only here, on `minimize`.
