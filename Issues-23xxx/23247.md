This is a followup to #19668 which added functionality for computing symmetric square L-functions of modular forms (via the Sage interface to Dokchitser's ComputeL GP/PARI script). Unfortunately, the code has a bug when the twisting character psi has non-real values, as one can see by checking the functional equation.

```
sage: F = Newforms(1,12)[0]
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(7).0
sage: F.symsquare_lseries(chi^2).check_functional_equation() # even char
-9.06002242118120e-8 - 1.94297172129154e-7*I
sage: F.symsquare_lseries(chi).check_functional_equation() # odd char
8.86658506905467e7 + 1.10964024593305e8*I
```
Note the huge discrepancy for the odd character. This is because the Gamma and epsilon factor parameters are being computed wrongly. (Thanks to Jim Brown for pointing this out)
