This doesn't actually seem to work due to the 2 hour time limit. Are we allowed to use multiple processors?

GitLab CI allows to use arbitrary so-called builder and in case the free builders aren't sufficient there're paid plans which most likely increase resources and timeout or the possibility to run your own machine(s) at home with all the possibilities of parallelization and clustering which come with Docker - if all Sage core developers ship in with their desktops and laptops you might find yourself with an improvised CI server farm for free.

> And use ccache?


It's a program that can be installed into Docker. It might have a very limited effect because the docker images are thrown away after each build.

And there is no way to keep persistent data, like in Travis CI? This would make an important difference.

Maybe. You can create your own Docker image which already has the data in it after booting the container.
