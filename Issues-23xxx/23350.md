`gamma` and `log_gamma` don't return the input type. This should be the correct behaviour but actually `CC` elements are returned at the moment:

```
sage: gamma(CDF(1,1))
0.49801566811835607 - 0.15494982830181067*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
sage: gamma(CIF(1,1))
0.49801566811835607? - 0.15494982830181068?*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement'>

sage: log_gamma(RDF(-2.5))
-0.056243716497674054 - 9.42477796076938*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
sage: log_gamma(RIF(-2.5))
-0.056243716497674054? - 9.4247779607693794?*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement'>
```

Dependencies: **pynac-0.7.10**

With `log_gamma` it seems we follow the RR convention of switching to complex for negative input. This means either this convention has to be changed or the point is moot.

with which version of Sage was it? With Sage 8.0 I get:

```
sage: gamma(CIF(1,1))

thus I don't get `ComplexIntervalFieldElement` as in the description.
