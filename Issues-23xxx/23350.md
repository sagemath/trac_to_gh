`gamma` and `log_gamma` don't return the input type. This should be the correct behaviour but actually `CC` elements are returned at the moment:

```
sage: gamma(CDF(1,1))
0.49801566811835607 - 0.15494982830181067*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
sage: gamma(CIF(1,1))
0.49801566811835607? - 0.15494982830181068?*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement'>

sage: log_gamma(RDF(-2.5))
-0.056243716497674054 - 9.42477796076938*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_double.ComplexDoubleElement'>
sage: log_gamma(RIF(-2.5))

sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_interval.ComplexIntervalFieldElement'>
```

Upstream: **Fixed upstream, in a later stable release.**

With `log_gamma` it seems we follow the RR convention of switching to complex for negative input. This means either this convention has to be changed or the point is moot.

<a id='comment:4'>Comment 4:</a>
with which version of Sage was it? With Sage 8.0 I get:

```
sage: gamma(CIF(1,1))
0.498015668118356 - 0.154949828301811*I
sage: type(_)
<type 'sage.rings.complex_number.ComplexNumber'>
```
thus I don't get `ComplexIntervalFieldElement` as in the description.
