With Py3, as reported in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/271

```
In [2]: import sage
In [3]: from sage.libs.pynac.constant import PynacConstant
In [4]: f = PynacConstant('foo', 'foo', 'real')
...
TypeError: expected bytes, str found
```
It's is in this part of the Sage-Pynac interface:

```
  /* "sage/libs/pynac/constant.pyx":68
 *             self.pointer = <GConstant *>&g_NaN
 *         else:
>>> *          self._object = new GConstant(name, ConstantEvalf, texname, domain)             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *             self.pointer = self._object
 * 
 */
  /*else*/ {
    __pyx_t_2 = __Pyx_PyObject_AsWritableString(__pyx_v_name); if (unlikely((!__pyx_t_2) && PyErr_Occurred())) __PYX_ERR(0, 68, __pyx_L1_error)
    __pyx_t_3 = __Pyx_PyObject_AsWritableString(__pyx_v_texname); if (unlikely((!__pyx_t_3) && PyErr_Occurred())) __PYX_ERR(0, 68, __pyx_L1_error)
    __pyx_v_self->_object = new constant(__pyx_t_2, ConstantEvalf, __pyx_t_3, __pyx_v_domain);
```
Apparently the error comes from this function (or below): https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/TypeConversion.c#L202

EDIT: also, one currently gets

```
In [28]: f = PynacConstant(b'foo', b'foo', 'real')

In [29]: f.__repr__()
Out[29]: b'foo'
```

Depends on #24222

It seems so. I am not able to reproduce that in ipython. And I am also currently no longer able to have a starting python3-sage, sadly.

No, no need for more info. Maybe I was not clear enough.

Using an ipython shell, I can do exactly what I did in the first part of the ticket description. And there is no longer any failure. So the problem has been fixed somewhere in one of the previous py3 tickets.

Believe me, one should close this one and concentrate on the many other py3 tickets..
