With Py3, as reported in https://github.com/pynac/pynac/issues/271

```
In [2]: import sage
In [3]: from sage.libs.pynac.constant import PynacConstant
In [4]: f = PynacConstant('foo', 'foo', 'real')
...
TypeError: expected bytes, str found
```
It's is in this part of the Sage-Pynac interface:

```
  /* "sage/libs/pynac/constant.pyx":68
 *             self.pointer = <GConstant *>&g_NaN
 *         else:
>>> *          self._object = new GConstant(name, ConstantEvalf, texname, domain)             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 *             self.pointer = self._object
 * 
 */
  /*else*/ {
    __pyx_t_2 = __Pyx_PyObject_AsWritableString(__pyx_v_name); if (unlikely((!__pyx_t_2) && PyErr_Occurred())) __PYX_ERR(0, 68, __pyx_L1_error)
    __pyx_t_3 = __Pyx_PyObject_AsWritableString(__pyx_v_texname); if (unlikely((!__pyx_t_3) && PyErr_Occurred())) __PYX_ERR(0, 68, __pyx_L1_error)
    __pyx_v_self->_object = new constant(__pyx_t_2, ConstantEvalf, __pyx_t_3, __pyx_v_domain);
```
Apparently the error comes from this function (or below): https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/TypeConversion.c#L202

EDIT: also, one currently gets

```
In [28]: f = PynacConstant(b'foo', b'foo', 'real')

In [29]: f.__repr__()
Out[29]: b'foo'
```
