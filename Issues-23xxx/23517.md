This implements Verma modules for Lie algebras (currently only implemented for the Chevalley basis implementation) and their homomorphisms (as U(**g**)-representations). In order to make this code to be potentially useful for affine Lie algebras, this creates the category of Kac-Moody algebras and the subcategory of those with a basis that respects the triangular decomposition.

The eventual goal is to be able to construct highest weight representations by quotienting each weight space by the corresponding weight space of the Verma submodules (of which, there are only a finite number that contribute). This code should also be extendable to the quantum group case once that PBW basis is implemented.

In order to have the action of the Lie algebra directly, you also need #23440. I originally wrote the doctests without #23440, so I did not include it as a dependency (nor updated/added any doctests).

I've checked the functionality from the point of view of a non expert who is familiar with the involved basic concepts. In this context, I noticed the following Problems:

1) A performance problem which I observed when I tried to define the irreducible 12-dimensional representation of sl2 and which should certainly be fixed:


```
sage: Lsl2 = lie_algebras.sl(ZZ, 2)
sage: WL = Lsl2.cartan_type().root_system().weight_lattice()
sage: La = WL.fundamental_weights()
sage: M = Lsl2.verma_module( 11* La[1])
sage: E, F, H =Lsl2.gens()
sage: PBW = Lsl2.pbw_basis()
sage: e, f, h = PBW(E), PBW(F), PBW(H)
sage: v = M.highest_weight_vector()
sage: v1bas=(f*v).support()[0]
sage:
sage: timeit('E = matrix( 12, 12, lambda i,j: (e*f**i*v).coefficient(v1bas**j))')
5 loops, best of 3: 6 s per loop

```

For this statement more than 57000 calls of the method _triangular_key where needed. After inserting the "`@`cached_method" decorator to the "_acted_upon" -method the same query gave:

```
sage: timeit('E = matrix( 12, 12, lambda i,j: (e*f**i*v).coefficient(v1bas**j))')
5 loops, best of 3: 30.3 ms per loop
```

The "`@`cached_method" decorator to the "_acted_upon"-method does also improve the statement of your example in the "singular_vector"-method of the VermaModuleHomset-class which is marked as "long time".

Without decorator:

```
sage: timeit('all(e * v == M.zero() for e in E)')
5 loops, best of 3: 5.98 s per loop
```

With decorator:

```
sage: timeit('all(e * v == M.zero() for e in E)')
5 loops, best of 3: 3.77 µs per loop
```

2) Another performance problem I noticed when calculating singular vectors. Partly, this seems to be caused by multiplication in the universal enveloping algebra:


```
sage: Lsp6 = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 6)                
sage: La = Lsp6.cartan_type().root_system().weight_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: la =    La[1]           - La[3] 
sage: mu = -3*La[1] - 2*La[2] - La[3]
sage: Mla = Lsp6.verma_module(la)
sage: Mmu = Lsp6.verma_module(mu)
sage: MuLa = Hom(Mmu, Mla)
sage: timeit('MuLa.singular_vector()', number=1r, repeat=1r)
1 loops, best of 1: 81.9 s per loop
```


```
sage: pbw =Lsp6.pbw_basis()
sage: f = Lsp6.f()
sage: F = {i: pbw(f[i]) for i in f.keys()}
sage: elt = F[3]**3*F[2]**3*F[1]**2
sage: timeit('F[2]**3*elt')
5 loops, best of 3: 710 ms per loop
```

Adding a cached_method decorator to the product_on_basis method of the PoincareBirkhoffWittBasis-class improved the needed time:

```
sage: timeit('MuLa.singular_vector()', number=1r, repeat=1r)
1 loops, best of 1: 16.6 s per loop
```

```
sage: timeit('F[2]**3*elt', number=1r, repeat=1r)
1 loops, best of 1: 272 ms per loop
```

If you can find a more structural and more satisfactory way to fix these performance issues, I would prefer this instead of the decorator approach.


3) I recommend to improve several doc-strings missing an INPUT section. Without these descriptions it is really hard for a persons that is not familiar with all special constructions in the Lie Algebra setting to understand what these methods do. For example it would be much easier to understand the "_monoid_key" method, if there would be a description like this (missing in PoincareBirkhoffWittBasis as well):

```
INPUT::
 
- `x` -- a tuple (alpha, n) describing an item of the dictionary of a basis element. Since the basis is indexed by the 
                            free abelian monoid generated by the basis of L such an item consist of an element
                            alpha of the basis of L together with an integer n indicating the exponent of alpha
```

Also, a more explicit example would help to understand this, for example, inserting the following line after the definition of M:

```
EXAMPLES::

...................
sage: M = L.verma_module(La[1])
sage: [ M._monoid_key((bas_ele, 1)) for bas_ele in L.basis().keys() ]
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

similar issues hold for "_triangular_key" and "_monomial_key". An "INPUT" section should also be added to the methods "degree_on_basis" and "homogeneous_component_basis", since these are directly accessed by the user.


Instead of improving the doc-string in cases where performance doesn't matter you may think about argument checks. For example, in the case of "_repr_generator" (similar "_latex_generator") a check like

```
if m not in M.basis().keys():
     raise ValueError
```

would avoid confusions like this:

```
sage: L = lie_algebras.sp(QQ, 4)
sage: La = L.cartan_type().root_system().ambient_space().fundamental_weights()
sage: M = L.verma_module(-1/2*La[1] + 3/7*La[2])
sage: m_wrong = M.basis().keys().indices()[2]
sage: m_right = M.basis().keys()[2]
sage: M.basis()[m_wrong]
-2*alpha[1] - alpha[2]*v[(-1/14, 3/7)]
sage: M.basis()[m_right]
f[-alpha[1] - alpha[2]]*v[(-1/14, 3/7)]
sage: 
```

4) Is the following really intended?

```
sage: pbw_verma = M.pbw_basis()
sage: pbw_lie   = L.pbw_basis()
sage: 
sage: pbw_verma == pbw_lie
False
sage: pbw_verma(L.e(1)) == pbw_lie(L.e(1))
True
sage: pbw_lie(L.e(1)) in pbw_verma
False
```

I am astonished about the first "False". The curiosity about the "True" seems to be inherited from CombinatorialFreeModule (which in my point of view is a bug, but I don't know if already reported):

```
sage: S3 = SymmetricGroup(3)
sage: S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)
sage: GA3 = S3.algebra(QQ)
sage: GA4 = S4.algebra(QQ)
sage: GA3.zero() == GA4.zero()
True
sage: GA3.zero() in GA4
False
```

For example, in the case of \"_repr_generator\" (similar \"_latex_generator\") a check like\n\n>\n> [snip]\n\n\nNo, it would not. The fundamental problem is `Family`, the object returned by `basis()`, plays it safe (in the sense that containment checking might be impossible or prohibitively expensive) and fast by not checking something is in the keys. This is an known complaint, but I sort of see it as garbage-in-garbage-out. There are a few subtle speed issues because of possibly changing the behavior of `Family`.

For equality, coercion is used (e.g., do you want `2/2 == 1` to be `False` because they are different parents?). So if there is a common parent, then it coerces to said parent and performs the computation in there. `__contains__` is under no such obligation. With that being said, there is #22707 to default to the generic `Parent.__contains__`, which should make the last one be `True`.",

I can add this if you insist, but I think it does not have any value because the code does the talking. (In fact, it is effectively a more documented/tested `lambda` function.)

I can add it, but I do not think it helps at all. IMO, the `sorted` showing how the more macro behavior changes is more useful to understand how to *use* the function.

Yes, but IMO, they are an implementation detail and should be hidden (and never called by a user). So I am treating them as such, and do not think they need to be as extensively documented.

No, it would not. The fundamental problem is `Family`, the object returned by `basis()`, plays it safe (in the sense that containment checking might be impossible or prohibitively expensive) and fast by not checking something is in the keys. This is an known complaint, but I sort of see it as garbage-in-garbage-out. There are a few subtle speed issues because of possibly changing the behavior of `Family`. In addition, such a proposed check would just result in a message saying the repr was bad; it wouldn't prevent you from creating and manipulating the elements.

It is not a bug but a feature. For equality, coercion is used (e.g., do you want `2/2 == 1` to be `False` because they are different parents?). So if there is a common parent, then it coerces to said parent and performs the computation in there. `__contains__` is under no such obligation. With that being said, there is #22707 to default to the generic `Parent.__contains__`, which should make the last one be `True`.

That is how they are defined in the category and is what is looked for by the general framework. So they currently have to be this way and would require changes likely to a good portion of Sage's codebase.

.... I will not insist on this issue. But please think about improvements (which must not necessarily follow my suggestions) from this point of view, again.

Further, by your improvements you may now erase the `# long time` mark in the `singular_vector` method. On my machine this command now takes 103 ms (it had been nearly 6 seconds before your changes).

If these things are done you may switch to positive review!
