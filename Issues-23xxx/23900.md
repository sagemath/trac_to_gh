If we want to remove the `element_constructor` argument to `Parent.__init__`, we should fix this:

```
cdef class Set_PythonType_class(Set_generic):
    [...]
    def __init__(self, theType):
        [...]
        Set_generic.__init__(self, element_constructor=theType, category=Sets())
        self._type = theType
```

This is easily done by defining an `_element_constructor_` method.

This branch also changes "type" to "class" in the documentation and `__repr__` to prepare for Python 3 (which consistently uses "class" in the `__repr__` of types).
