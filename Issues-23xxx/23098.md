Follow-up to #22806 and #22896: we should stop using the deprecated files `cysignals/memory.pxi` and `cysignals/signals.pxi`.

Given the large number of files which need to be changed, this is done in parts.

On Ubuntu 16.04, make ptestlong gives one failing test:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 42.7 src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/homology/simplicial_complex.py", line 2854, in sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex.is_cohen_macaulay
Failed example:

Expected:
    False
Got:
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/slabbe/.sage/temp/miami/31097/dir_1cIgyu/31279.out'

**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of   8 in sage.homology.simplicial_complex.SimplicialComplex.is_cohen_macaulay
    [598 tests, 1 failure, 3.18 s]
```
but it seems unrelated and is not reproducible.

I confirm the positive review.
