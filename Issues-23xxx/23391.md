#21579 is a different problem, or it turned out to be 2 problems. We have a patch to fix the infinite loop, I guess, but linbox still gives me wrong answers sometimes.

I guess we should apply the linbox patch until there is a new version of linbox, but possibly also change flint to be the default.

Hi,
I suspect this may be due to the unlikely corner case where we sample at random the zero vector to be used as a Krylov iterate.
I forced this vector sto be zero and noticed that charpoly indeed hangs forever.
I pushed a patch in this ticket's branch which forces to sample a non-zero vector. I could not reproduce the bug in the first place, so any feedback whether this patch fixes the problem would be welcome.

- Running the same test on the branch u/cpernet/errors_calculating_characteristic_polynomials_of_rational_matrices of  #21579 seems to fix this bug
- Running the same test on upsteam develop branch with the patches of #21579 applied seems to fix the bug too.

Should be call this a duplicate of #21579 ? Or move the patches of #21579 to a branch here, and let #21579 open, as another bug is waiting for a fix there ?
