sage: parent(dab[[1,2,3]])
Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R3
sage: parent(eps[[1,2,3]])
Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R3
```
While this is triggered by changes in Pynac that should be addressed it's not clear to me why the division of two scalar fields must go through `SR` at all.
