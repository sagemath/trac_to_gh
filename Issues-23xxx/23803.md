The upgrade to Sphinx-1.6.3 broke docbuilding if `make doc-clean` was not done. This is because the "environment pickle" from the old Sphinx failed to unpickle with the new Sphinx. This pickle is not so important, we can just ignore this error and continue.

**Upstream**: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4048

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23803

Actually, I'm experimenting with a much simpler change to allow a graceful upgrade to Sphinx-1.6.3: it's a specific pickle which fails to load. Wrapping that in `try`/`except` might work.

Is it worth printing more information than just

```
[diophanti] loading pickled environment... failed: 'module' object has no attribute 'WarningStream'
```
to let users know that this is indeed harmless?

The point, as I said, is "to let users know that this is indeed harmless". Some people worry when they see messages saying that something "failed".
