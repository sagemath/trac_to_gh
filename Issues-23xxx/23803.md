The upgrade to Sphinx-1.6.3 broke docbuilding if `make doc-clean` was not done. This is because the "environment pickle" from the old Sphinx failed to unpickle with the new Sphinx. This pickle is not so important, we can just ignore this error and continue.

Is it worth printing more information than just

The point, as I said, is "to let users know that this is indeed harmless". Some people worry when they see messages saying that something "failed".
