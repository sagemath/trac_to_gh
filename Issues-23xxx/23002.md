Today, i am meeting two students who did some Sage development and show them how to contribute their code (related to spanning-trees for digraphs and sandpiles), so we took an existing method and i explained the whole git/trac process, and since we were discussing the difference list/iterator, we chosed that one. So, indeed, this is not an important change regarding Sage, but it has some pedagogical interest.

Wile being a minor improvement, this commit adds some tests to that method ; also, when possible, iterators are prefered over lists, as they save a lot of memory while being as fast, which can be critical for some backtracking or search algorithms, where such constructions can be stacked.

This is becoming the default case with Python3, where even `range` becomes an iterator. Ideally, most method should behave that way (when there is no cost). In particular, in the longer term, i am in favor to replace things like `neighbor_iterator` by `neighbors` and `neighbors` by nothing, while the user can write `list(G.neighbors())` if she explicitely wants to store the whole stuff for reuse.

If it is OK for you, go ahead, i guess it is better for them to first create tickets and recieve lots of comments from experienced devs about their code (doctests, naming conventions, ...).

Thanks, this indeed cleaner, i will do it.

> A more serious comment: This is a backwards incompatible change. So I would instead introduce a new method `bridges_iterator` similar to other methods in graphs (e.g., `degree`, `subgraph_search`, `edge_iterator`/`edges`).

Well, i am more in favor to remove the `_iterator` in other methods as explained in [comment:4](#comment%3A4) or we are going to get entangled. When we will move to Python 3, should we define a `range_iterator` wrapper ?

Regarding the `edges` method, returning a list has a very bad side effect: a list is an iterable but also a container, but the containment is ill-defined for graphs:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: (0, 1) in G.edges(labels=False)
True
sage: (1,0) in G.edges(labels=False)
False
sage: G.has_edge((1,0))
True
```

This causes a lot of troubles as it does not even raise a warning.

My longer term plans would be to define an `edge()` view (à la `numpy`), with `__contains__` pointing to `has_edge`, and `__iter__` pointing to `edge_iterator`, so that every feature works correctly with a 	pleasant syntax.

I do not disagree with this, but at this point we should try to be as consistent as possible. If we are going to change the behavior, we should do it for all or most such methods at once to reduce the backwards breaking shock. Although we could put a deprecation warning in `bridges` to say it will return an iterator and while we add the `bridges_iterator`, we add it with a deprecation as well saying we will just have an iterator version of `bridges` in a year.

That one is a much harder and more subtle issue (which deserves a separate ticket). My first thought was basically what you are suggesting too. +1

I am pretty sure we are *not* switching to Python3 in 8.0. The big changes are the default notebook and support for Cygwin. We still have a bit of work before we are ready to be Python3 compatible, but that isn't way off in the future now.

However, I think there are still differences between Python's view objects and true iterators being returned. Plus, `list` will still be perfectly valid in Python3, so changing to an iterator is still a separate can of worms in my mind.
