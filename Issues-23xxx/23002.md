Wile being a minor improvement, this commit adds some tests to that method ; also, when possible, iterators are prefered over lists, as they save a lot of memory while being as fast, which can be critical for some backtracking or search algorithms, where such constructions can be stacked.

This is becoming the default case with Python3, where even `range` becomes an iterator. Ideally, most method should behave that way (when there is no cost). In particular, in the longer term, i am in favor to replace things like `neighbor_iterator` by `neighbors` and `neighbors` by nothing, while the user can write `list(G.neighbors())` if she explicitely wants to store the whole stuff for reuse.

If it is OK for you, go ahead, i guess it is better for them to first create tickets and recieve lots of comments from experienced devs about their code (doctests, naming conventions, ...).

Thanks, this indeed cleaner, i will do it.

Well, i am more in favor to remove the `_iterator` in other methods as explained in comment:4 or we are going to get entangled. When we will move to Python 3, should we define a `range_iterator` wrapper ?

Regarding the `edges` method, returning a list has a very bad side effect: a list is an iterable but also a container, but the containment is ill-defined for graphs:

```
sage: G = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: (0, 1) in G.edges(labels=False)
True
sage: (1,0) in G.edges(labels=False)
False
sage: G.has_edge((1,0))
True
```

This causes a lot of troubles as it does not even raise a warning.

My longer term plans would be to define an `edge()` view (à la `numpy`), with `__contains__` pointing to `has_edge`, and `__iter__` pointing to `edge_iterator`, so that every feature works correctly with a 	pleasant syntax.

<a id='comment:16'></a>[comment:8](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23002#comment:8) makes me realize that the `bridges` method makes the strong assumption that not only edges are ordered (we use `(0, 1)` and not `(1,0)`) but also blocks (we have block `[0, 1]` and not block `[1, 0]`). If we want to strengthen the method to avoid future problems, we could make `ME` a graph and then use `ME.has_edge(tuple(b))`,  or use a faster method if any.

Then we should conclude on this ticket. Either we decide that we continue the current practice and create method `bridge_iterator`, or we consider that as a first step toward turning all methods to iterators we start with `bridges`.
