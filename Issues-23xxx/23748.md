There are various reasons to limit the maximal amount of memory that doctests can use:
1. Bugs which cause large memory usage and which can cause trouble for the OS when running doctests.
2. It is good to check that doctests do not use a large amount of memory.
3. It allows to doctest graceful recovery when memory cannot be allocated by intentionally allocating more memory than available.

I suggest to limit the virtual memory for doctests. The following two files contain the tests which need the most memory:

```
src/sage/game_theory/matching_game.py
src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py
```

This branch also reduces the memory needed for `matching_game.py`, such that `heegner.py` is now the doctest which requires the most memory.

With 1GB, you cannot even start Sage.

And some doctests in `src/sage/schemes/elliptic_curves/heegner.py` do not pass with a limit of only 3GB.

Maybe we also want to consider a `# high memory` marker (another ticket?) or have `# long time` also allow higher memory?

We should probably change this then:

```
travis@apricot:~/sage/src/sage/categories$ sage -tp category.py category_types.py 
[snip]
Doctesting 2 files using 8 threads.
```
Although I am somewhat surprised my memory usage is not higher when I am running parallel tests since each copy of Sage should take a minimum of 1Gb. *shrugs*, oh well, not important.

I don't mind 4Gb, I probably prefer it over the 3.x for simplicity.

Well, remember that this is *virtual* memory. Most of that 1GB is shared between processes. If you run 10 copies of Sage, the executable code of Sage needs to be in *physical* memory only once: the OS maps the same physical memory inside the 10 processes.

Then there is also memory which is reserved but typically not used: Sage might allocate a large PARI stack and GAP memory pool for example which counts against virtual memory. However, as long as this memory is not actually used, you don't need that much physical memory.

I am pretty sure it is this block of tests that takes the large amount of memory (with `n = 10`):

```
        sage: from itertools import permutations
        sage: suitr_preferences = list(permutations([-i-1 for i in range(n)]))
        sage: revr_preferences = list(permutations([i+1 for i in range(n)]))
        sage: for player in range(n):
        ....:     big_game.suitors()[player].pref = suitr_preferences[player]
        ....:     big_game.reviewers()[player].pref = revr_preferences[-player]
        sage: big_game.solve()
        {1: -1, 2: -8, 3: -9, 4: -10, 5: -7, 6: -6, 7: -5, 8: -4, 9: -3, 10: -2}
```
That is `2 * 10! * 10 == 72576000` integers plus other stuff. Might consider dropping `n = 8` instead for this example.

In case it helps, I did test this on `sardonis` (ppc64le with lots of RAM) and on my laptop (`x86_64` with 6GB of RAM) and it passed tests. 32-bit should also pass for the simple reason that the condition `memlimit <= sys.maxsize()` will be false.

I just got hit again by the issue of doctests taking infinite memory, apparently this creates an infinite list:

```
sage: L = [1, 2, 3]
sage: L.extend(-x for x in L)
```

I'm just saying that this ticket protects against stupid mistakes like this, which might otherwise cause the system to start to swap and become unresponsive.

Everything seems to be okay on my laptop as well (`x86_64` with 8Gb of RAM).

I'm actually slightly surprised Python doesn't catch that as it does so well (sometimes too well) with mutating `dict`s.

Indeed. Let's kick this to the buildbots and into a beta to see if this causes any trouble.

I have another failure in that file that is not related to memory, so there is probably problems with other tickets touching that file. I'll see if I can find out which one(s).

I wouldn't think so but if you can repeat the failure you can just comment those two lines in `sage-runtests`

```
        if lim == resource.RLIM_INFINITY or lim > memlimit:
            resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (memlimit, hard))
```
and see if it improves things.

That would be very surprising. How can runnning doctests with limited memory make something work accidentally?
