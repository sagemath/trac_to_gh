a speedup mainly for reasonably small tableaux (the main problem is the checking in `Partition` when calling `self.shape().conjugate()`, but even without this check, the new version is faster):

```
sage: l = [t for t in SemistandardTableaux(6)]
sage: %timeit [conjugate(t) for t in l]
1 loop, best of 3: 3.35 s per loop
sage: %timeit [conjugate2(t) for t in l]
1 loop, best of 3: 684 ms per loop
sage: l2 = [StandardTableaux(4000).random_element() for i in range(10)]
sage: %timeit [conjugate(t) for t in l2]
1 loop, best of 3: 1.04 s per loop
sage: %timeit [conjugate2(t) for t in l2]
1 loop, best of 3: 990 ms per loop
```
