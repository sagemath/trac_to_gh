Keywords: sd86.5, sd87

Currently, when creating a principal ideal from a single generator, that exact generator is not returned when requesting the generator for the ideal:

```
sage: R.<x> = QQ[]
sage: a = R(1337)
sage: R.ideal(a).gen() is a
False
```

This is unfortunate because anything that is cached in `a` has to be recomputed.
