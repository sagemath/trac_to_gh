Speaking of typos:

```
+        worker. Under normal circumstances, the worker is supposed to
+        exit by himself after finishing.
```
Now, I am French, and I make this mistake often, to ascribe neutral gender to male gender.  `himself` -> `itself`

Apart from that I don't really have any objection in principle to this ticket, I'd love to have backtrace on those hanging process. Whether it will be useful is another question that cannot be answered without trying.
