Part of #12426. To allow distutils to link when the compiler is clang on linux we need to import the fix for upstream python issue http://bugs.python.org/issue25229

On linux the proper way to pass linking option to the linker is to use `-Wl,-R` but python insist on doing so only for gcc claiming other compiler do not need `-Wl` which is patently false.

```
