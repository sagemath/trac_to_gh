Part of #12426. To allow distutils to link when the compiler is clang on linux we need to import the fix for upstream python issue http://bugs.python.org/issue25229

On linux the proper way to pass linking option to the linker is to use `-Wl,-R` but python insist on doing so only for gcc claiming other compiler do not need `-Wl` which is patently false.

```
clang -fno-strict-aliasing -OPT:Olimit=0 -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wno-unused -fPIC -I/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage-clang/local/include -Izmq/utils -Izmq/backend/cython -Izmq/devices -c build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers.o

True, although the autoconf style of actually running stuff (like, run the compiler/linker in various ways and check what works) is superior. This doesn't always work, but it's a good philosophy.

I only have access to OS X machines, and pyzmq claims to build without error there (with #12426). So maybe Dima is better for a reviewer, since he uses clang on linux.

right, let me try on Gentoo. Shouldn't this ticket be dependent on #12426 ?
Or, more precisely, anything that is required to specify clang(++) as the C(++) compiler?

Yes, the only way to try it is to have #12426 as well. But they can be merged independently because they touch completely different parts of sage.

If you look at the branch, you'll see that both python2 and python3 are patched.
