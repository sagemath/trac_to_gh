Part of #12426. To allow distutils to link when the compiler is clang on linux we need to import the fix for upstream python issue http://bugs.python.org/issue25229

On linux the proper way to pass linking option to the linker is to use `-Wl,-R` but python insist on doing so only for gcc claiming other compiler do not need `-Wl` which is patently false.

```
clang -fno-strict-aliasing -OPT:Olimit=0 -g -O2 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wno-unused -fPIC -I/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage-clang/local/include -Izmq/utils -Izmq/backend/cython -Izmq/devices -c build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers.o
    clang build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers.o -L/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage-clang/local/lib -R/home/fbissey/sandbox/git-fork/sage-clang/local/lib -lzmq -lrt -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/scratch/vers
    Error running version detection script:
