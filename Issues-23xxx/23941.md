This implements the dual graded graph introduced by Vasu Tewari and Stephanie Van Willigenburg in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04614v1.pdf.

I don't know whether local rules are available.  I made up a forward rule which yields Sarah Mason's insertion algorithm.

I also don't know a name for the saturated chains ("standard tableaux") in the Q-graph.

Main question: where should I put Sarah Mason's insertion algorithm?
 It takes a word with positive integer letters and yields a `CompositionTableau`.

* into a new file `mason.py`?
* into `composition_tableau.py`?
* into `rsk.py`?
* into `permutation.py`?
