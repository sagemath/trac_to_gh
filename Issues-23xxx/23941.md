This implements the dual graded graph introduced by Vasu Tewari and Stephanie Van Willigenburg in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04614v1.pdf.

I don't know whether local rules are available.  I made up a forward rule which yields Sarah Mason's insertion algorithm.

I also don't know a name for the saturated chains ("standard tableaux") in the Q-graph.

Main question: where should I put Sarah Mason's insertion algorithm?
 It takes a word with positive integer letters and yields a `CompositionTableau`.

* into a new file `mason.py`?
* into `composition_tableau.py`?
* into `rsk.py`?
* into `permutation.py`?

    "body": "<a id='comment:8'></a>Sorry for taking so long to look at this. IMO, Mason insertion should go into the `rsk.py` file as it is a similar sort of insertion algorithm and be added as an option to `RSK`.

Plus it is more discoverable as part of `RSK`. The other option is we create a new `insertion_algorithm.py` file and add it there. Something else to consider is adding a `mason_insert()` method to `CompositionTableau` (or moving the `mason_insert` function there). Your thoughts?\n\nThere are also some methods that do not have docstrings and some of the one-line descriptions do not match Sage's formatting (it starts on the next line after `\"\"\"`).",

There are also some methods that do not have docstrings and some of the one-line descriptions do not match Sage's formatting (it starts on the next line after `"""`).
