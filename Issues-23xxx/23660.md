Looks fine.

Maybe you could make the paragraph in `_richcmp_` a warning or note block.

Failed example:

Expected:

      To:   Rational function field in x over Rational Field
      Defn:   Conversion via FractionFieldElement_1poly_field map:
              From: Integer Ring
              To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
            then
