File "src/sage/categories/rings.py", line 117, in sage.categories.rings.Rings.MorphismMethods.is_injective
Failed example:
    f = ZZ.hom(K); f
Expected:
    Composite map:
      From: Integer Ring
      To:   Rational function field in x over Rational Field
      Defn:   Conversion via FractionFieldElement_1poly_field map:
              From: Integer Ring
              To:   Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
            then
              Coercion map:
              From: Fraction Field of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Rational Field
              To:   Rational function field in x over Rational Field
Got:
