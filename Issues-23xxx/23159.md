In `src/sage/symbolic/ring.pyx`, there is this very unusual code:

```python
            if not hasattr(_the_element,'_fast_callable_') or not inspect.ismethod(_the_element._fast_callable_):
                # only warn if _the_element is not dynamic
                from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
                deprecation(5930, "Substitution using function-call syntax and unnamed arguments is deprecated and will be removed from a future release of Sage; you can use named arguments instead, like EXPR(x=..., y=...)")
```
The condition involving `inspect.ismethod` makes no sense to me... it was introduced in #2516.

The problem is that this breaks doctests in #22747, which changes some attributes from non-methods to methods. The easiest fix is to revert this change from #2516 and unconditionally give the deprecation warning.

Well, `z = var('z')` is a bit confusing since it first injects `z` in the global namespace and then assigns it again to the variable `z`. So either we change it to

```
sage: var('z')
z
```
or

```
sage: z = SR.var('z')
```

Anyway, this is minor aspect of the patch which I will gladly revert.

There is also sporadically `_ = var(...)` in the documentation.
