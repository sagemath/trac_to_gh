With GMP is used instead of MPIR, there are two doctest failures because of error checking that GMP does but MPIR does not:

Since both mpir and gmp are optional packages couldn't we also implement a fix by having

```
2^(2^63-2) #optional mpir
some error
2^(2^63-2) #optional gmp
another error

Ok, I created a branch with how I think the fix should look like. But I did not put it to needs review yet because I do not understand how to check that it works, the main problem is that I do not now how to properly build sage with gmp.

I tried just:

```
sage -i gmp
```
in a sage that was already build since I was hoping to save time, but this does not work (it is running the optional gmp test and not the mpir one, but the test result is that of mpir). Should I do:

```
sage -i gmp
make build
```
Or do I need to do:

```
make distclean
make gmp 
make build
```

I got an error that configure was not found in a clean install, so I had to do

```
make configure
./configure --with-mp=gmp
make
```

I am now building and waiting for how the tests turn out. If you already have an install with gmp lying around and you test this branch there then you will probably know the results before I do.

The commands:

```
make configure
./configure --with-mp=gmp
make
```
resulted in the failure building of mpfr on OS X 10.12.4 with Xcode 8.3.3 before gcc was build. I've attached the log, so I still don't know how to test it on this machine. I can test it on Ubuntu tomorrow.

Ok, I tested the current branch on:

- 32-bit gmp + #19706
- 32-bit mpir
- 64-bit mpir

I still need to test 64-bit gmp + #19706 since the build on my laptop got interrupted a few times, I think it should pass but I am not 100% sure. I am hesitant to put it into needs review before I know this case passes, however if either of you can verify that this case also passes then feel free to review this ticket.

I don't think this ticket needs a dependency on #19706 since it merges cleanly with it.

Ok the case: 64-bit gmp + #19706 failed.  I didn't realise that the doctesting framework only sees errors as errors if the error is thrown on the first line.

So the expected/got in 

```
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MemoryError: failed to allocate ... bytes   
Got:
    gmp: overflow in mpz type
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 515, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 885, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.rings.integer.Integer._shift_helper[8]>", line 1, in <module>
        Integer(1) << (Integer(2)**Integer(60))
      File "sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 6177, in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__lshift__ (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:39270)
        return (<Integer>x)._shift_helper(y, 1)
      File "sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 6138, in sage.rings.integer.Integer._shift_helper (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:39014)
        sig_on()
    RuntimeError: Aborted
```
Is a bit misleading since for the passing doctest for this is without the "gmp: overflow in mpz type" line.

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Aborted
```
anyway. It now passes in all 4 cases for me, so ready for review.
