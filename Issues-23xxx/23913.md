With GMP is used instead of MPIR, there are two doctest failures because of error checking that GMP does but MPIR does not:

Since both mpir and gmp are optional packages couldn't we also implement a fix by having

```
2^(2^63-2) #optional mpir
some error
2^(2^63-2) #optional gmp
another error
```

in the mean time? If someone here at this ticket thinks that it is a good idea, then I will create a ticket with the relatively easy patch for it.

That's an interesting idea considering that by default tests are run with `--optional=mpir,python2,sage` so the default behavior isn't changed. But I am not sure what happens when `gmp` is selected. But I think that is a good approach.

The default argument for optional is actually determined programmatically. `sage` is always there and the rest is just a list of optional packages. It just happens that python2 and mpir are optional packages that are installed by default. If you would build sage with python3 and gmp instead it will be `--optional=gmp,python3,sage` instead.

Ok, I created a branch with how I think the fix should look like. But I did not put it to needs review yet because I do not understand how to check that it works, the main problem is that I do not now how to properly build sage with gmp.

I tried just:

```
sage -i gmp
```
in a sage that was already build since I was hoping to save time, but this does not work (it is running the optional gmp test and not the mpir one, but the test result is that of mpir). Should I do:

```
sage -i gmp
make build
```
Or do I need to do:

```
make distclean
make gmp 
make build
```

It took me longer then it should to figure out how to pull #19706, but it now works and gets me past mpfr. The build is now at the point of building gcc.  I'll report back tomorrow.

Ok, I tested the current branch on:

- 32-bit gmp + #19706
- 32-bit mpir
- 64-bit mpir

I still need to test 64-bit gmp + #19706 since the build on my laptop got interrupted a few times, I think it should pass but I am not 100% sure. I am hesitant to put it into needs review before I know this case passes, however if either of you can verify that this case also passes then feel free to review this ticket.

I don't think this ticket needs a dependency on #19706 since it merges cleanly with it.

Ok the case: 64-bit gmp + #19706 failed.  I didn't realise that the doctesting framework only sees errors as errors if the error is thrown on the first line.

So the expected/got in 

```
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MemoryError: failed to allocate ... bytes   
Got:
    gmp: overflow in mpz type
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 515, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/home/jdemeyer/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 885, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.rings.integer.Integer._shift_helper[8]>", line 1, in <module>
        Integer(1) << (Integer(2)**Integer(60))
      File "sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 6177, in sage.rings.integer.Integer.__lshift__ (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:39270)
        return (<Integer>x)._shift_helper(y, 1)
      File "sage/rings/integer.pyx", line 6138, in sage.rings.integer.Integer._shift_helper (build/cythonized/sage/rings/integer.c:39014)
        sig_on()
    RuntimeError: Aborted
```
Is a bit misleading since for the passing doctest for this is without the "gmp: overflow in mpz type" line.

```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: Aborted
```
anyway. It now passes in all 4 cases for me, so ready for review.
