CC:  stumpc5

since a noncrossing partition really is a set partition:

```
sage: DyckWord([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]).to_noncrossing_partition()
{{1, 3}, {2}}
```

So #23877 should get it down to around 90 µs. I don't think #23880 would have as noticeable an impact on the speed, but I haven't tried.

If instead you think this should return a lists of lists, you should mark it as invalid.

`@`Travis, thanks for your further tests -- I think it should return a set partition. And in fact I do not care personally about optionally returning a list of lists in bottleneck situations.

But I find it weird to accept such a huge overhead that makes this piece of code possibly unusable.

Actually, I do not know why it didn't occur to me that this should depend on #23877 to get the speedup. Now I get

```
sage: D = DyckWord([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])

The slowest run took 12.39 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

So now the overhead is somewhat minimalized, and I suspect the overhead time will not be a serious bottleneck in applications (although perhaps running this though building the FindStat database might be a good stress test).

I would like to clean up the following.  I realise that the only way that it is related to this ticket is performance and clean code, please bear with me.

It seems to me that we now have two coding patterns that achieve roughly the same thing:

1. in `set_partition.py`, we have `SetPartitions._element_constructor_(self, s, check=True)`, which calls `self.element_class(self, s, check=check)`.  The check that `s` is valid input is done in the element class (in the case at hand, using a `check` protocol implemented by `ClonableArray`.

2. in `partitions.py` we have `Partitions._element_constructor_(self, lst)`, which does the checking, and then calls `self.element_class(self, lst)`.

Shouldn't we promote a uniform pattern?  The second seems much more sensible to me.  Why does `CloneableArray` implement its own thing?
