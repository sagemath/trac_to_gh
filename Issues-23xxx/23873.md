IMO, this should return a `SetPartition` rather than a list (of lists), and there should not be a flag that would change that output. So functionally, this ticket is an improvement and good to go. Now, for speed, we have

```
sage: D = DyckWord([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])
sage: %timeit D.to_noncrossing_partition()
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.23 µs per loop
sage: %timeit SetPartition(D.to_noncrossing_partition())
10000 loops, best of 3: 131 µs per loop
sage: %timeit SP = SetPartitions(D.semilength()); SP(D.to_noncrossing_partition())
1000 loops, best of 3: 253 µs per loop
```
So if this is in a tight loop, then it's a problem. If you want to wait for #23877 and/or #23880, then as per [comment:7](#comment%3A7), you can leave milestone to sage-pending until that is done. However, #23877 shouldn't be too long to a positive review. Here is what the speed gain should be by:

```
sage: SP = SetPartitions(D.semilength())
sage: ncp = D.to_noncrossing_partition()
sage: x = SP(ncp)
sage: %timeit x.check()
10000 loops, best of 3: 161 µs per loop
```
So #23877 should get it down to around 90 µs. I don't think #23880 would have as noticeable an impact on the speed, but I haven't tried.

If instead you think this should return a lists of lists, you should mark it as invalid.

`@`Travis, thanks for your further tests -- I think it should return a set partition. And in fact I do not care personally about optionally returning a list of lists in bottleneck situations.

But I find it weird to accept such a huge overhead that makes this piece of code possibly unusable.

Actually, I do not know why it didn't occur to me that this should depend on #23877 to get the speedup. Now I get

```
sage: D = DyckWord([1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])
sage: %timeit D.to_noncrossing_partition()
The slowest run took 12.39 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 63 µs per loop
```
So now the overhead is somewhat minimalized, and I suspect the overhead time will not be a serious bottleneck in applications (although perhaps running this though building the FindStat database might be a good stress test).

I would like to clean up the following.  I realise that the only way that it is related to this ticket is performance and clean code, please bear with me.

It seems to me that we now have two coding patterns that achieve roughly the same thing:

1. in `set_partition.py`, we have `SetPartitions._element_constructor_(self, s, check=True)`, which calls `self.element_class(self, s, check=check)`.  The check that `s` is valid input is done in the element class (in the case at hand, using a `check` protocol implemented by `ClonableArray`.

2. in `partitions.py` we have `Partitions._element_constructor_(self, lst)`, which does the checking, and then calls `self.element_class(self, lst)`.

Shouldn't we promote a uniform pattern?  The second seems much more sensible to me.  Why does `CloneableArray` implement its own thing?
