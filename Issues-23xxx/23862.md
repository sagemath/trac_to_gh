Some possible improvements:
- if your tableau has only one row you just have to test whether the first and last elements coincide (ie no need to take the time consuming conjugate)
- similarly, if your tableaux has one column there is nothing to check
- now for the remaining cases, you would better use `set.issubset` as in

```
s = set(T_conj[0])
for i in range(1, len(T_conj)):
    ss = set(T_conj[i])
    if not ss.issubset(s):
        return False
    s = ss
```
  Doing loops is always a bad idea in Python. If you need speed, avoid them as much as possible.

Thanks for looking!  One quick thing: I thought about using sets, but apparently I cannot assume that the elements of the tableau are hashable.

I am guessing though that the method doesn't make sense then...

Also, it is faster to use just one `all` check, which does short-circuit as soon as it gets a `False` with generators:

```python
return all(x in T_conj[i-1] for i in range(1, len(T_conj)) for x in T_conj[i])
```
The definition allows general elements; however, I think it is a fair assumption that all entries of the tableau are hashable.
