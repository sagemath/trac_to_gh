1 loop, best of 3: 7.8 s per loop
sage: %timeit [t.is_key_tableau() for t in l]

```
The remaining time of `left_key_tableau` is spent in computing the conjugate of a partition, which will be optimized in a separate ticket.
new:

```
sage: %timeit [t.left_key_tableau2() for t in l]
1 loop, best of 3: 3.61 s per loop
sage: %timeit [t.is_key_tableau2() for t in l]

```
Achieved by removing a test which checked whether the input is a key tableau, probably intended to save work.

Some possible improvements:
- if your tableau has only one row you just have to test whether the first and last elements coincide (ie no need to take the time consuming conjugate)
- similarly, if your tableaux has one column there is nothing to check
- now for the remaining cases, you would better use `set.issubset` as in

```
s = set(T_conj[0])
for i in range(1, len(T_conj)):
    ss = set(T_conj[i])
    if not ss.issubset(s):
        return False
    s = ss
```
  Doing loops is always a bad idea in Python. If you need speed, avoid them as much as possible.

Thanks for looking!  One quick thing: I thought about using sets, but apparently I cannot assume that the elements of the tableau are hashable.

I am guessing though that the method doesn't make sense then...
