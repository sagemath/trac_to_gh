This should not raise an error as the category is the correct input:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['A',2])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(max_depth=3, category=HighestWeightCrystals())
...
TypeError: 'HighestWeightCrystals_with_category' object is not iterable
```

---
This should not raise an error either as it should take the appropriate join category:

```
sage: K = crystals.KirillovReshetikhin(['A',3,1], 2,3)
sage: S = K.subcrystal(index_set=[1,3], category=HighestWeightCrystals())
...
ValueError: Subcategory of `Category of finite crystals` required; got `Category of highest weight crystals`
```
Contrast that with this:

```
sage: B = crystals.infinity.Tableaux(['A',2])
sage: S = B.subcrystal(index_set=[1], category=HighestWeightCrystals())
sage: S.category()
Category of highest weight crystals
```

---
The category is not passed to the parent `subcrystal` call:

```
sage: x = B.module_generator()
sage: S = x.subcrystal(max_depth=3, category=HighestWeightCrystals())
sage: S.category()
Category of finite crystals
```
