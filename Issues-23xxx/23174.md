<a id='comment:13'></a>I also made some reviewer changes. Basically they are all done to improve the C code generated by Cython. One thing that might be more controversial is my unrolling of

```python
        for i in range(deg):
            v += x.list()
            x *= yp

I did this so you don't create as many temporary objects and to avoid the repeated calls to `self._parent.degree()` and `self._parent.polynomial()`. If you don't want the more complicated code, feel free to revert the last commit.
