```
Multiplying two sparse matrices over a small prime field sometimes produces incorrect results. Small example:

```
sage: p = next_prime(2**15); p
32771
sage: M = Matrix(GF(p), 1,3, lambda i,j: -1, sparse=True); M
[32770 32770 32770]
sage: M*M.transpose()
[32738] # INCORRECT, should be 3
```

In fact, the result in this case is off by 2<sup>32</sup> (mod p) indicating an int overflow.
