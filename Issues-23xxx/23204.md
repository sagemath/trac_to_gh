A strong -1 on calling the category (first): this is relatively expensive, not likely able to be implemented by the `MorphismMethods` of a category if you have to do formal compositions, and is meant to be overwritten. Really, if you want composite maps, then you should overwrite the `_composition_` hook.

No bare exceptions.

I don't understand why this needs to be a more generic class:

This is almost certainly a speed regression:

You need to properly handle old pickles with the old class.

Error messages are not really sentences (according to Python's conventions):

The reason is that default convert maps do not inherit from Morphism. It is certainly related to this ticket. The type of a map changed, so thi isinstance check has to be more liberal.

David is going to have another look. There should not be a speed regression. Actually the opposite should be the case. Before the composite map was wrapped in another map, now it is directly accessible. We are going to double check that this is true.

> I agree with the purpose of this ticket and would like to see the ring morphism code simplified. However, I care a lot about the speed in here because polynomials are a core part of the Sage functionality.

Sure. Let's be careful about not causing any regressions here.

If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \\circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.\n\nIn contrast, when a category does have enough information to simplify maps, it should implement the `_composition_` hook to return the correct composition map.\n\n> > No bare exceptions.\n\n> What do you mean?\n\nYou indirectly took care of it in a810e3c:\n\n```diff\n@@ -998,12 +998,16 @@ cdef class Element(SageObject):\n             False\n \n         \"\"\"\n+        if hasattr(self,'_parent'):\n+            P = self._parent\n+        elif hasattr(self,'parent'):\n+            P = self.parent()\n+        else:\n+            return True # By convention!\n         try:\n-            zero = self._parent.zero()\n-        except:\n-            return False\n-\n-        return self != zero\n+            return self != P.zero()\n+        except (AttributeError,ValueError):\n+            return True # By convention!\n \n     def is_zero(self):\n         \"\"\"\n```\nActually, I don't see how you could get anything other than the first case as `Element` has a `_parent` attribute this is checked within `Element`), much less into the second block because why would it have a meaningful `.parent()` method in that case?

Either that or we should also remove `RingMap_lift` with some more generic class for lifts (if that is what we decide to do, we can do that here or on a followup).\n\n> > I am a little wary of removing `RingHomomorphism.__nonzero__` as that specialized code does do a check that could be faster and might be a little better behaved because no equality checking is involved.

If the ring homset has no zero, then is relatively expensive because of the throwing and catching of an error and is something done every time. If there is a zero map, then it should only affect the first time it is called, but then it has to do a comparison because of the default `Element.__nonzero__`.

You added two blocks for formal composite functions:

```python
        try:
            # we try the category first
            # as of 2017-06, the MRO of this class does not get patched to
            # include the category's MorphismMethods (because it is a Cython
            # class); therefore, we can not simply call "super" but need to
            # invoke the category method explicitly
            return self.getattr_from_category('is_injective')()
        except (AttributeError, NotImplementedError):
            pass
```
What I am saying is this is really (relatively) expensive for something that is almost certainly going to be implemented. If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.

In contrast, when a category does have enough information to simplify maps, it should implement the `_composition_` hook to return the correct composition map.

You indirectly took care of it in a810e3c:

Actually, I don't see how you could get anything other than the first case as `Element` has a `_parent` attribute this is checked within `Element`), much less into the second block because why would it have a meaningful `.parent()` method in that case? If there is such a class out there, then it is a bug IMO and should be fixed to initialize `Element`. So I would probably just do

```python
try:
    return self != self._parent.zero()
except Exception:
    return True # By convention
```
unless you want something that returns a `TypeError` or `NotImplementedError` to not be caught. For that I am a little more unsure.

That smells a little like you have encountered a bug and something really should be returning a `RingMap_lift`. Either that or we should also remove `RingMap_lift` with some more generic class for lifts (if that is what we decide to do, we can do that here or on a followup).

That does not seem possible. If the ring homset has no zero, then is relatively expensive because of the throwing and catching of an error and is something done every time. If there is a zero map, then it should only affect the first time it is called, but then it has to do a comparison because of the default `Element.__nonzero__`. What were the cases you tested?

I do not see why this needs to be reduced to `Map` but for `RingMap`, it can still be passed in a `Morphism`. If you're sure that this is okay, then I will take your word for it because I don't know that area of the codebase so well.

You should use lower case for the initial letters and not have a period (full stop) at the end. Even if this differs with the rest of the file, we are trying to follow Python conventions.

You should be correct as no parent implements a custom `coerce`. However, this does mean we have to be more liberal with types (see above).

Could you explain why you needed to change this doctest:

I do not understand how this relates to `_composition_`. The point here is simply that in the category of Rings, a morphism that has a field as its domain, knows that it is injective. However, we can not so easily turn the composition into one morphism.

Sorry, I had misread your initial comment. There is probably a speed regression but when would this possibly be relevant (i.e., when do you create lots of rings and check that morphisms between them are nonzero? without knowing that you are talking about rings.)

`ZZ.hom(ZZ)` is an `IdentityMorphism` now which does not have an `inverse_image()` method. We went from `NotImplementedError` to `AttributeError` it seems.

So this really is a subtle backwards incompatible change. Hopefully nobody was just catching the `NotImplementedError`. I don't think there is any (reasonable) way to put a deprecation and/or get around that.

This test is also not valid because `Zp` is a class, not a parent.

Actually, that brings up another question, not just that you need to handle old pickles, but do we want to have a small deprecation class for `RingHomomorphism_coercion`? This is an implementation detail, but it is something publicly documented. So someone might have code that uses this class and that code would just break upon upgrade.

Someone might have a use case for it; I know people create lots of polynomial rings over finite fields as the field size varies, and they might be doing a check for a nonzero map in that code.\n\nIf you're creating polynomial rings over finite fields, then the morphism can never be zero so you won't be calling this code.  The only time you can have a zero morphism is if the codomain is the zero ring.  It seems unlikely that you're going to be testing this enough that the difference between `200ns` and `20\u00b5s`\n\nThe benefit is that we are now able to use a general framework for morphisms between rings that don't inherit from `RingHomomorphism`, for example the coercion map from `ZZ` to `QQ`.  In my opinion, this is valuable enough to merit the speed regression in this case.\n\nFinally, Julian and I talked about it and we don't see an easy way to add the custom code back in.  Since `__nonzero__` is a double underscore method, we can't use `cached_method` there, and you can't productively use `cached_method` on `zero` since it won't cache the fact that it raised an error.  Moreover, if we try to implement this in the category, then in order to  hook code into `__nonzero__` we have to make it slower for all other elements, which doesn't seem reasonable.\n\n> > > Could you explain why you needed to change this doctest:\n> > > \n> > > ```diff\n> > > @@ -861,7 +808,7 @@ cdef class RingHomomorphism(RingMap):\n> > >  \n> > >          This is not implemented in any generality yet::\n> > >  \n> > > -            sage: f = ZZ.hom(ZZ)\n> > > +            sage: f = ZZ.hom(Zp)\n> > >              sage: f.inverse_image(ZZ.ideal(2))\n> > >              Traceback (most recent call last):\n> > >              ...\n> > > ```\n\n> > `ZZ.hom(ZZ)` is an `IdentityMorphism` now which does not have an `inverse_image()` method.

I feel like for something like this you should have a generic field morphism class that knows outright that it is injective and implements a custom `_composition_` that returns the same class because it is completely determined by the image of `1`.

Someone might have a use case for it; I know people create lots of polynomial rings over finite fields as the field size varies, and they might be doing a check for a nonzero map in that code.

If you're creating polynomial rings over finite fields, then the morphism can never be zero so you won't be calling this code.  The only time you can have a zero morphism is if the codomain is the zero ring.  It seems unlikely that you're going to be testing this enough that the difference between `200ns` and `20Âµs`

The benefit is that we are now able to use a general framework for morphisms between rings that don't inherit from `RingHomomorphism`, for example the coercion map from `ZZ` to `QQ`.  In my opinion, this is valuable enough to merit the speed regression in this case.

Finally, Julian and I talked about it and we don't see an easy way to add the custom code back in.  Since `__nonzero__` is a double underscore method, we can't use `cached_method` there, and you can't productively use `cached_method` on `zero` since it won't cache the fact that it raised an error.  Moreover, if we try to implement this in the category, then in order to  hook code into `__nonzero__` we have to make it slower for all other elements, which doesn't seem reasonable.

I don't see a way to deprecate it either, but I'm not too worried about it.

Agreed; I think Julian is fixing this now.

> Actually, that brings up another question, not just that you need to handle old pickles, but do we want to have a small deprecation class for `RingHomomorphism_coercion`? This is an implementation detail, but it is something publicly documented. So someone might have code that uses this class and that code would just break upon upgrade.

Yeah, it seems reasonable to add something like

```
from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
class RingHomomorphism_coercion(RingHomomorphism):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwds):
        deprecation(23204, "Don't use this")
        RingHomomorphism.__init__(self, *args, **kwds)
```

Okay, we came up with some situations where the speed might matter.  For example, if you call `coerce_map_from` it returns either a morphism or `None`.  It's possible that people then use the result in a boolean context to determine whether it's `None`.

We'll try to improve the speed.

If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \\circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.\n\n> > > > I do not understand how this relates to `_composition_`. The point here is simply that in the category of Rings, a morphism that has a field as its domain, knows that it is injective. However, we can not so easily turn the composition into one morphism.\n\n> > > \n> > > So you're doing implementing that at the category level? I feel like for something like this you should have a generic field morphism class that knows outright that it is injective and implements a custom `_composition_` that returns the same class because it is completely determined by the image of `1`. So the composition would amount to chasing through each map what happens to `1`. If you are using some more specialized morphisms and need the generic composition, then let the generic code of the composition do its thing. I don't see the point of slowing everything else down for a special case that is more effectively dealt with by a concrete class.\n\n> > \n> > Morphisms from fields aren't completely determined by where they send 1 (they have to send 1 to 1).  For example, complex conjugation is a morphism of fields.  Moreover, fields can embed into lots of kinds of rings that aren't fields, and you don't want to require a concrete class for each of these situations.  One of the reasons for the existence of the category framework is to enable writing generic code like this.\n\n> \n> Ah, right. However, you are not doing general code, you are doing a special case, which IMO is a relatively small set of the cases, in a concrete class. Because of that, it should be a separate class if you really need that. To me, the category framework is primarily for general code that is *not* implemented in a concrete class, but can be used as a fallback, and often times, it is slow. I strongly believe that there is no practical advantage in any situation to having to do a Python call up to through the category framework instead of just letting the composite map do its thing. Moreover, I believe there will be a penalty for this extra (useless) call up through the category in general; there is typically not enough structure to say anything.\n\nWe are removing a wrapper class.

If your category has morphisms such that you cannot effectively simplify a composition `f \circ g` to a single map `h`, then I don't see how you would have enough (generic) information to check that the composition is injective/surjective. So I doubt this would ever get used.

> > > > I do not understand how this relates to `_composition_`. The point here is simply that in the category of Rings, a morphism that has a field as its domain, knows that it is injective. However, we can not so easily turn the composition into one morphism.

> > > 
> > > So you're doing implementing that at the category level? I feel like for something like this you should have a generic field morphism class that knows outright that it is injective and implements a custom `_composition_` that returns the same class because it is completely determined by the image of `1`. So the composition would amount to chasing through each map what happens to `1`. If you are using some more specialized morphisms and need the generic composition, then let the generic code of the composition do its thing. I don't see the point of slowing everything else down for a special case that is more effectively dealt with by a concrete class.

> > 
> > Morphisms from fields aren't completely determined by where they send 1 (they have to send 1 to 1).  For example, complex conjugation is a morphism of fields.  Moreover, fields can embed into lots of kinds of rings that aren't fields, and you don't want to require a concrete class for each of these situations.  One of the reasons for the existence of the category framework is to enable writing generic code like this.

> 
> Ah, right. However, you are not doing general code, you are doing a special case, which IMO is a relatively small set of the cases, in a concrete class. Because of that, it should be a separate class if you really need that. To me, the category framework is primarily for general code that is *not* implemented in a concrete class, but can be used as a fallback, and often times, it is slow. I strongly believe that there is no practical advantage in any situation to having to do a Python call up to through the category framework instead of just letting the composite map do its thing. Moreover, I believe there will be a penalty for this extra (useless) call up through the category in general; there is typically not enough structure to say anything.

We are removing a wrapper class. This should make things like `__call__` faster which is probably much more important. Also, in this case there is enough structure in the category of rings to say interesting things.

Ok. We were just discussing ways of making it faster. We have implemented one.

The idea is not to require morphisms of rings to inherit form `RingHomomorphism`. They should mostly inherit from whatever makes their implementation easiest. So, we certainly do not want to get rid of classes such as `RingHomomorphism_im_gens`.

Did you try just implementing `__nonzero__` for the category? I forget if this works with extension classes and special methods. There doesn't seem to be an implementation of `__nonzero__` otherwise in the MRO.

There are some good reasons to have these concrete classes, with some stemming from a general lack of structure of ring morphisms.

Of course we're not going to beat two cython function calls, but I don't think that that should be the standard.  There are times when speed regressions are acceptable.

I don't see how it matters whether there are other categories that can do so.  It's possible in `Rings()`, and there are multiple tickets waiting on this functionality.  How does removing `RingHomomorphism_coercion` affect other categories anyway?

`DefaultConvertMap` is implemented across multiple categories.  The coercion between `ZZ` and `QQ` does not inherit from `RingHomomorphism`.  I suspect that there are others across Sage.

Yes, but this is not one of those times IMO.

Do you mean used in multiple classes in multiple categories? However, there are no subclasses or other parallel implementations AFAIK.

>  The coercion between `ZZ` and `QQ` does not inherit from `RingHomomorphism`.  I suspect that there are others across Sage.

The `ZZ -> QQ` probably should inherit from `RingHomomorphism`. I would say any others that are ring morphisms should inherit for both uniformity and to take advantage of that code. There is no cost to this unless the plan is to remove `RingHomomorphism` altogether as an ABC (I am not sure this is the best thing going forward, but I haven't really thought about it yet).

I do support adding extra default implementations in the category, but I do not support always forcing concrete classes to make any sort of super calls, more so as the first attempted action.

From the patchbot, there are still failing doctests and the documentation does not build.

You do not get to set a positive review just because you fixed some trivial doctest failures. Code needs to be peer-reviewed, not self-reviewed. Furthermore, that was not the only problem according to the patchbot:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/schemes/curves/projective_curve.py  # 3 doctests failed
```
and again the documentation does not build according to the patchbot.

Most importantly, there is still ongoing discussion about the code in this ticket, and you do not get to unilaterally say the code is good. You cannot set a positive review until the debate is resolved.

Your tone is condescending and youâre making incorrect assumptions about the person who set the positive review having not read the code, etc.

I still strongly disagree with adding the check to up the category MRO in the generic `FormalCompositeMap` for a few special cases. Compare:

```
sage: V1 = QQ^2
sage: V2 = QQ^3
sage: phi1 = (QQ^1).hom(Matrix([[1, 1]]), V1)
sage: phi2 = V1.hom(Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]), V2)
sage: from sage.categories.map import FormalCompositeMap
sage: c1 = FormalCompositeMap(Hom(QQ^1, V2, phi1.category_for()), phi1, phi2)
sage: %timeit c1.is_injective()
The slowest run took 3132.19 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 41.9 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit for _ in range(1000): c1.is_injective()
10 loops, best of 3: 40.8 ms per loop
```
vs before:

```
sage: %timeit c1.is_injective()
The slowest run took 34968.62 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 4.88 Âµs per loop
sage: %timeit for _ in range(1000): c1.is_injective()
100 loops, best of 3: 4.98 ms per loop
```
That is a 10x slowdown for checking if injectivity/surjectivity is done at the category level, and I believe that most categories will not be able to implement either. At least the only one given so far is injectivity for `Fields`.

Feel free to try the generic code first and ask the category only if that fails/throws. Then again, when the category can answer it, it's probably fasterâ¦Anyway, I just want `is_injective` to work. I personally do not care about a few Âµs in `is_injective` since it currently almost always throws a `NotImplementedError` for me anyway.

PS: I could also imagine that some categories could quickly answer `False` when there are dimension reasons why a morphism can not be injective/surjective.

That is not true. Checking in/surjectivity for a formal composite morphism that is not in the category of rings will be slowed down by a 10x factor as demonstrated above, and it is not simply comparing something to `None`. However, I am not fully convinced that the new code results in a speedup:

```
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: L.<y> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: M.<z> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: f = K.hom([y])
sage: g = L.hom([z])
sage: %timeit (g*f).is_injective()
10000 loops, best of 3: 81.3 Âµs per loop
```
vs before

```
sage: %timeit (g*f).is_injective()
10000 loops, best of 3: 46 Âµs per loop
```
The reason why I am unsure is because the first time I run with the new code, I get ~28.5 Âµs. However, this does not happen on re-trails. Do you also experience this? Actually, when I removed the caching on `is_injective` in `Rings()` (for testing purposes, which is fair since this would most likely get called repeatedly on new maps if done in a tight loop), I consistently get the faster time and

```
sage: %timeit phi.is_injective()
The slowest run took 16.17 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
100000 loops, best of 3: 9.33 Âµs per loop
```
vs old:

```
sage: %timeit phi.is_injective()
The slowest run took 6.60 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
10000 loops, best of 3: 19.8 Âµs per loop
```
So this does in fact net a ~2x speedup for this case.

However, given the check for if something is in fields, that made me think of the following situation. Suppose we implement a special morphism for ring morphisms out of **Z**/n**Z** that checks for injectivity by looking at the image of `1` and the characteristic of the codomain (at least this seems like a reasonable thing to do at some point). Then compose this with some other map that knows about its injectivity (maybe checking if some sort of representation is faithful over various characteristics).

The `git blame` above is not that relevant to the code I am referring to in `FormalCompositeMorphism`. That added code is the only issue that I (currently) have with this ticket.

What about my comment about undoing the deprecation on `is_RingHomomorphism`?

I can think of some cases where not having the `FormalCompositeMap` call up to the category results in errors being raised that otherwise would not. Specifically, if one of the maps in the formal composition being something that cannot say anything. So it is good to have it in there, but I strongly believe it should not be called first. Instead, it should be the fallback.

I am not. Also, anybody trying to understand why this change was made latter will not have this context either. Since a few people in a room are making decisions and not giving me this context, I am going to stop reviewing and writing any code involving ring morphisms/coercions. I've spent too much time, energy, and political capital working on this.
