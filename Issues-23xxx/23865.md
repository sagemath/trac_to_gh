Disable the following from `sage/rings/polynomial/omega.py` that takes forever without any justification

```
sage: from sage.rings.polynomial.omega import Omega_ge
sage: %time Omega_ge(0, (2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1))[0].number_of_terms()
CPU times: user 53.1 s, sys: 66 ms, total: 53.2 s
Wall time: 53.1 s
27837
```
(running the doctests in `omega.py` takes longer than running the doctests in all other files from `sage/rings/polynomial/`)

The motivation for having this is, that there is a separate computation for the result meaning that the result is somehow verified. I do not recall that it took that long and will investigate.
