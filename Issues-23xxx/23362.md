Ah ah, sounds like upgraded pandocfilters from 1.3.0 to 1.4.2 fixes the issue.

I had a bunch of recent pandocfilters here and there (in conda envs or ~/.local); presumably one of them was overriding sage's one, which prevented me to reproduce the error.

I will now work on updating sage's pandocfilters spkg.

Vincent, in the mean time, could you upgrade by hand your pandocfilters with:

```
    sage -pip install --upgrade pandocfilters
```

and double check that this indeed fixes the problem for you?
